BUREAU OF EDUCATION, 
Washington, D. C., January 1, 1892. Pape 
Sir: I have the honor to submit herewith my second annual report 
for the year ending June 30, 1890. 
. GENERAL STATISTICS.* 
  The total number of pupils enrolled in the schools of all grades, 
public and private, in all the States for the year ending June 30, 1890, 
is 14,512,778, the same being an increase of 786,204, or 5.73 per cent, 
over the previous year. This number is not inclusive of attendance on 
evening schools, and many other kinds of schools of a special character 
-(enumerated in a note on page 1), which, in the aggregate, amount to 
some 300,000 pupils, and increase the total to about 14,800,000. 
Of these, 96$ per cent are reported as receiving elementary instruc- 
tion only—that is to say, only an average of 34 in 100 pupils in the 
schools during the year were studying any branches above the course 
of study laid down for the first eight years (6 to 14). 
One pupil in forty was under secondary instruction, 7. ¢., in the 
course of study prescribed for ninth to the twelfth year’s work—say 14 
to 18 years of age. 
One pupil in one hundred and seven was under superior instrue- 
tion (colleges, universities, and equivalent grades of work arranged for 
pupils in their thirteenth to sixteenth years’ work, and aged from 19 to 
22 years). : 
Reducing these items to an absolute standard by comparing them 
with the whole population, we see—

REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
LENGTH OF SCHOOL YEAR. 
The school term varies in localities, the average number of days for 
the whole country being 134.3 days, the average for the 
North Atlantic division being 
South Atlantic division ... 
South Central division .. 
North Central division ee eee 
Western division 
The divisions containing numerous cities have an advantage in the 
- length of school term over the sparsely settled regions devoted to agri- 
culture. The-cities North, South, East, and West with considerable 
uniformity hold annual school sessions of nearly two hundred days, 
while the populations outside of cities and villages hold a three months’ 
school in the winter and possibly a shorter session in the summer, 
except in those States that fix by law a minimum session of greater’ 
length. 
ACTUAL AVERAGE AMOUNT OF SCHOOLING RECEIVED BY THE EN- 
TIRE POPULATION. 
  From the annual returns, showing entire number enrolled and their 
average attendance in days, it is easy to tell what is the actual aver- 
age amount of schooling received by the entire population of a given 
State or of the whole country. 
With the present percentageof attendance and length of school term 
each person in the United States, on an average, will receive four and 
three-tenths years’ schooling of two hundred days each, taking into 
consideration both publie and private schools. 
The several divisions compare in this respect as follows: 
Schooling to each inhabitant: 
North Atlantic division -.. 
South Atlantic division . 
South Central division .. 
North Central division 
Western division - 
Average for whole United States, 4.30, 
There are four States that exceed six years to each inhabitant, namely: —

  When we consider that four yearsis the average time occupied in 
_learning the branches in primary grades, occupying the first half of the 
course of study in elementary schools, we see how small is the average 
amount of instruction received in schools by the people of the country.

  EFFORTS IN THE SOUTH. : aay. 
It suffices barely for learning how to read, to write, and to use num-— 
bers in the simplest processes; but taken in connection with the 
almost universal circulation of the daily newspaper, the matter does 
not seem so desperate, for the newspaper serves as a sort of continuing _ 
school and effects a- slow and gradual progress’ among the people 
throughout life along lines of literary growth. 
PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SCHOOLS. 
Not quite one-eighth of the pupils are enrolled in private schools of 
all kinds. In the older and wealthier sections of the country the pri- 
vate schools reach an enrollment of nearly one-sixth of all the pupils; 
in the other sections the proportion falls as low in some cases as one- 
thirteenth in private schools. 
EXPENDITURES. 
The total amount raised for the support of common schools for the 
year 1889-90 was $143,110,218, or an average of $2.29 for each man, 
woman, and child in the nation, and $17.22 for each pupil of the aver- 
‘age in attendance on school. 
EFFORTS IN THE SOUTH.. 
Although the shortness of the school term in the agricultural sec- 
tions causes them to suffer in comparison with the sections containing 
the cities, yet the proportion of the population actually brought into 
school for longer or shorter periods each year shows great zeal in those 
communities. For the whole country the per cent of population enrolled 
in school some time in the year is 23.18. By divisions this varies as 
follows: Per cent of en- ~

  The Southern States on the Atlantic coast enroll a larger proportion 
of the population in school than the States north of them. The Gulf 
States enroll a still larger proportion. But the Northern States of the 
Mississippi Valley and the Lake regions surpass all other sections in 
the proportion enrolled in school. 
In my last report I showed that the sixteen Southern States had in- 
ereased in thirteen years as follows in the enrollment on the common 
elementary schools:

  XVI REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
INTERNATIONAL EDUCATIONAL CONGRESS AT PARIS, 
The report on the International Educational Congress, held at Paris, 
by Mr. W. H. Widgery,* together with his studies on the exhibition of 
educational material at the great exposition then in progress, will be 
read with more interest just now in connection with the preparations 
in progress for the Columbian Exposition at Chicago in 1893. (See 
Chapter 1, pp. 41-143.) E 
  
*The death of Mr. William Henry Widgery, assistant master of University Col- 
lege School, London, which occurred March 26, 1891, deprives England of a teacher 
in whom great natural gifts were enhanced by the finest training and the highest 
ideals of his profession. The loss will be felt also in other countries, since in addi- 
tion to his work as a teacher, Mr. Widgery had made contributions to the literature 
of his profession which had attracted wide attention. Indeed so marked were his 
abilities as a writer and lecturer on educational subjects, that it appeared as if the 
call for his life work would be rather in this field than in the more restricted limits 
of the school. In the latter service, however, his rare personal qualities found a con- 
genialsphere. His energy and enthusiasm were contagious, his manly spirit won the 
respect of his boys which his sympathies deepened into love, while to his associate 
teachers he was a companion, genial, helpful, and inspiring. His teaching is said 
to have been “singularly interesting and clear.” He brought his pupils face to face 
with principles and excited them to thinking. He wasa greatstudent of method, 
taking the most fruitful suggestions from the minds with which he was dealing, but 
he never allowed his teaching to degenerate into mechanical routine. English was 
his favorite subject and he managed to make it not only interesting, but disciplinary, 
disclosing in this work and in his pleading for a better study of phonetics truly 
original powers. 
Mr. Widgery was born in Exeter, March 11, 1856, his father being a well-known 
artist of that city. He was a pupil in the Exeter Grammar School, in which he 
obtained a scholarship for St. John’s College, Cambridge. He graduated in 1879 as 
seventh’ senior optime in the mathematical tripos, ill-health preventing his taking 
the higher mathematical honors. In 1880 he gained the Harness prize of his uni- 
versity for an essay on the first quarto of Shakespeare’s Hamlet, a scholarly piece of 
work, which was favorably noticed in the Atheneum, and also in Anglia and the 
Englische Studien. He took the degree of M. A. in 1882, and the same year was 
offered the position which he held at the time of his death. In 1886 he studied 
forsome time in Germany, giving his attention chiefly to comparative philology and 
modern languages. 
The literary work which Mr. Widgery had accomplished was scanty, but of admir- 
able quality. It comprised, in addition to the Cambridge essay, a short tract on the 
teaching of languages reprinted in 1890 from the Journal of Education (London), 
and an unfinished series of papers in the Modern Language‘Monthly on modern philol- 
ogy. The former has been favorably noticed in Germany, and is about to be trans- 
lated into Swedish. These papers, with a few unsigned book reviews, complete the 
list of published matter. In 1889, Mr. Widgery gave up a much-needed holiday for 
the sake of visiting the educational section of the Paris Exhibition; here I met him, 
and at my request he,undertook the preparation of areport on the educational depart- 
ment of the exposition. 
Fortunately, although his increasing physical weakness retarded the report, it 
was virtually ready for print at the time of his death. The interest which his wide 
experience of educational system, his critical judgment, and his admirable style 
would naturally excite in the work will be deepened by the sad fact that it was 
the-last effort of his life. The editing of the manuscript was kindly undertaken by 
Mr. Widgery’s friend, Mr. Foster Watson:
-P-A-G-E-17
  STUDIES IN FOREIGN EDUCATIONAL SYSTEMS. XVII 
The chief interest centered on the question regarding the position 
which Latin and Greek should occupy in the course of study. A great 
revolution is in progress in respect to the course of study for secondary 
schools, and the old time prominence of the classic languages is vigor- 
ously combatted. It was noticeable that the women teachers present 
in the congresses made a strong presentation of their side on all ques. 
tions in which sex concerns education. France will follow the lead of 
England in making prominent the higher education of girls. 
As a continuation and supplement to Mr. Widgery’s report, I present 
(Chapter 111, pp. 143-186) a translation* of the full report of the second- 
ary congress, published by M. Dreyfus Brisac. 
STUDIES ON FOREIGN EDUCATIONAL SYSTEMS. 
In my last report I presented several studies on the educational sys- 
tems of Europe, including those of Germany, France, England, Italy, 
Sweden, Finland, and Spain. The specialists of the Bureau have con- 
tinued these studies, and I am able to offer in the present report a 
survey of thesystem of Scotland, together with an outline of the history 
ofits development. (Chapters Iv and V, pp. 187-236.) 
The importance of Scotland to the world, and the great importance 
of its educational system as contributing to the rank which it holds 
in the world’s history make this chapter of great interest. Macaulay 
has eloquently described the effect of the establishment of people’s 
schools (p. 231, note 1). 
The account of educational operations for the past year is prefaced by 
a brief survey of the entire system, designed to aid the reader to see the 
relation of the recent movements to what has gone before (Chapter VI). 
A similar brief statement has been prepared to show the educational 
system of France (Chapter vit), and make clear the record of recent 
educational events in that country. ° 
A comparative study of London and Paris in their SAE tor ele- 
mentary education (Chapter viit) follows. 
Education in Germany has been further illustrated in the present 
report by studies on the middle schools, the private schools, and vari- 
ous sociological phases of Prussia, and a sketch of the schools of the 
kingdom of Saxony (Chapter Ix). 
An account of the celebrated school conference at Berlin in Decem- 
ber, 1890, and a preliminary sketch of the system of higher schools of 
Prussia have been prepared for the Bureau by Mr. Thurber (Chapter x), 
According to the plans arranged last year, each specialist, after work- 
ing out his detailed statements of the school systems of the countries 
assigned to him, is to make two briefer statements, the second one being 
of the kind called “a bird’s-eye view,” and giving the barest outlines 
of the organization and history of education in those countries. This

      XVUI REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
brief conspectus of its educational development should be prefixed to 
each yearly review of the current school events of a given country by 
way of explanation. The reader of the educational news of foreign 
countries usually finds it a profitless task, because he lacks a knowledge 
of the preceding events that have’ led to the present situation. The 
trend, whence and whither, is necessary for a clear idea of the signifi- 
cance of the current events reported. ; 
In the present report are offered the first attempts at making brief 
statements of the educational systems of Prussia and Austria, in 
Chapters xm and x11; and conspectuses of France, Austria, and 
Prussia are given in connection with the record of their school trans- 
actions for the past year. Noteworthy in the Prussian system.is the 
compulsory attendance law, the dates 1717, 1763, 1806, and 1825 being 
important in its history. Other items of especial interest are (a) the 
high rate of attendance compared with the total number of different 
pupils enrolled during the year; (b) the large number in the secondary 
schools, amounting to 1.2 per cent of the whole population, or double 
the per cent of secondaries in the United States (0.58); (ce) the small 
proportion of girls in the classical course of secondary and higher edu- 
cation; (d) the large proportion of men teachers; and (e) the pension- 
ing of superannuated teachers. It must be noted that the terms 
“secondary ” and “higher” or “superior” education do not have pre- 
= cisely the signification given them in the United States. One should 
    subtract the Sainbes of students enrolled in the last two years of the 
course of study in aGerman gymnasium or in a French lycée and add 
it to the number enrolled in the university in order to get the aggregate . 
of students in superior education for comparison with American enroll- 
- ment in colleges and universities.* - 
Besides Scotland, Austria-Hungary, Norway, and Denmark have been 
studied, and the regalts presented in this report (Chapters XI, XIV, Xv). 
In the Austria- Hungary system the point of interest’ is the reaction 
against.the continual tendency to separation in thought and customs 
caused by diversity of languages. The tendency of the Hungarian to 
find kis higher culture in science rather than in Latin and Greek is to 
be explained in part by the fact that the Hungarian literature does not, 
like the Germanic and Romanie literatures, derive its inspiration from 
the classic tongues. 
  
* For the first time an attempt has been made by the Statistician to collect com- 
plete returns of the public high schools in the same manner as those of private 
academies and seminaries, and the statistics of the two classes of public and private 
secondary schools are so arranged that they may be used for future comparison; 
but, owing to the impossibility of securing the most accurate data of public second- 
ary schools the first year, the results only are given without discussion, with the 
hope that the returns for another year will make it possible to give fairly com- 
plete results. This plan for the future will include reports of the students pursuing 
studies usually known as secondary in all these schools. See pages 1888 to 1485 of 
_present report.

  SOCIAL PATHOLOGY IN EDUCATION. KIX 
In Norway, as in Sweden, the attempt has been made to distinguish 
in the school laws between the urban and rural populations, and the 
results of this are worth the consideration of our own State superin- 
tendents. 
In recent years there has been avigorous effort in Sweden to give an 
industrial bent to the schools of the people, and this effort influences 
the school systems of all countries on its borders. The conquest of 
nature by productive industry in England and France has attracted 
the attention of the Scandinavian nations and Russia. In order to 
gain the coveted industrial advantages in the briefest time, various . 
educational devices have been contrived, and the whole world finds 
useful pedagogic hints worthy of adopting in the Russian school shop 
and in the Swedish sléjd instruction. Denmark furnishes further les- 
sons in the line of experiment with industrial branches, and also in its 
attempt to provide for two sets of pupils by one school building. . But 
it seems strange that these northern countries have not yet adopted 
eoeducation very extensively in the schools above the primary grades, 
when its great economy is considered. 
COMPARATIVE EXHIBIT OF EDUCATION IN EUROPE AND AMERICA. 
Chapter XVI gives a useful summary sNowing some. important par- 
ticulars in regard to education in thirty-four countries of Europe and 
twenty-nine countries of America, North and South. 
FOREIGN UNIVERSITIES. 
A useful table of foreign universities, giving dates of foundation, 
number of professors, and students, to the number of nearly 200, is given — 
in Chapter xv (p. 561). 
SOCIAL PATHOLOGY IN EDUCATION. 
A paper on the scientific study of the weakling classes of society is 
found in Chapter xvi. All exact science begins with quantitative 
measurement and involves enumeration, accurate records of order of 
succession, date, duration, locality, environment, extent of influence, — 
and number of cases of intermittences. Fix these things once and a 
basis is made for progress in science without retrograde movements, 
It is easy by future observations to verify the results found or to add 
an increment of new observationss 
The study of the slums of East London—the “cloaca maxima” of 
modern civilization—has furnished a basis on which the grandest ex- 
periments for the elevation of the weakling classes have been instituted, 
and all countries with city problems to deal with are looking anxiously 
at the means employed and the results accomplished by these humane 
endeavors. : 
The three weakling classes—paupers, criminals, and insane—espe-

cially the first two, tend to come together in the same district of a city, 
thus forming what is called a “slum.” The worst consequences of this 
segregation of the weakling classes is the propagation of pauperism, 
crime, and disease by education; for the slum is an educative influence 
well nigh irresistible to all children born within it. 
LIST OF SUPERINTENDENTS OF SCHOOLS. 
In chapter X1x is a list of State school officers, followed by a list 01 
city school superintendents, brought down to the date of printing this 
report. About 800 cities and towns have supervision by salaried super- 
intendents. 
x CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS. 
In the chapter on city school systems (pp. 603-616), Mr. J. C. Boykin, 
the specialist in charge, has made an interesting comparative table, 
showing the number and aggregate population of cities in the several 
States, together with value of school property, cost of tuition, school 
enrollment, and similar details. He has added a useful supplemen- 
tary chapter (part 11, chapter 11) on the salaries of teachers; giving 
the Schedules of salaries in sixty-seven cities, together with a histor- 
ical exhibit showing the saleries in five cities for every year since the 
establishment of their public school systems. These five cities are St. 
Louis, Baltimore, Boston, New Orleans, and Cincinnati. These com- 
parative tables show the rising estimation of the value of the teacher’s 
services, and should be. studied in connection with the increase of pro- 
fessional training among teachers and the gradual introduction ot 
skilled superintendents into cities as managers of the schools. 
SCIENTIFIC TEMPERANCE INSTRUCTION IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS, 
A chapter worthy of careful attention in the present report is the com- 
pilation by the specialist on State systems, Mr. F. E. Upton, of the 
material relating to the compulsory temperance instruction in the sev- 
eral States and Territories. Out of forty-nine all but eleven have passed 
mandatory laws requiring scientific temperance instruction. This chap- 
ter contains information on text-books, course of study, together with a 
model sketch of a method of teaching the effects of alcohol on the sys- 
tem, the reports of school officials on the enforcement, of the law (espe- 
cially the report of George H. Martin on the results in Massachusetts), 
criticisms on the temperance instruction given in text-books, and replies 
to criticisms by Miss Mary H. Hunt. 
COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES. 
In the report for 1888-89 the course of study in more than 100 col- 
Jeges and universities was tabulated. Mr. Lewis A. Kalbach, special- 
ist on this subject, has prepared for the present report a supplementary 
table showing the course of study in 15 colleges and seminaries for
-P-A-G-E-21

women, mostly located in the South and West (pp. 750-754). The sta- 
tistics of colleges and universities are illustrated by graphic views show- 
ing the growth of coeducation in superior instruction, the distribution 
“-of regular college students among the five geographical divisions of 
the nation, the sources of income and the productive funds, andthe ben--  _ 
efactions received in the several divisions. . 
An exhibit is made (pp. 783-787) showing the courses of study (or 
schools) in the several departments of the State universities, and the 
manner in which the government of each is vested. A list of the new 
buildings for colleges during the -year is reported on pages _ 795-798, 
compiled from the year books. 
An interesting compilation of statistics regarding the length of the 
college curriculum, showing the increased requirements for graduation, — 
together with remarks and opinions of prominent college men, is given 5 
in chapter vi (p. 799). Chapter vit gives a survey of the graduate 7 
departments of universities and colleges, showing their development 
and present status. 
  PROFESSIONAL EDUCATION. 
Two elaborate chapters have been prepared by the specialist on pro- 
fessional education (1x and x), taking up 160 pages of this report. The 
exhibit is for ten years of growth in the several schools devoted to 
theology, law, medicine, and applied science’in its several forms of © 
engineering (civil, mechanical, and mining), architecture, agriculture, 
and university instruction in pedagogy. The comparison of American 
and European courses of study in these professional schools, it is 
believed, greatly enhances the value of these two chapters. 
MISCELLANEOUS. 
A chapter on the methods employed in the reformation of juvenile 
offenders (pp. 1063-1072), and another on the education of the colored * 
race (1073-1102), and a third on the Swedish or Ling gymnastics (1103- 
1108), are followed by the usual compilation of excerpts from the docu- 
ments of city and State superintendents. These present brief and per- 
tinent expressions of opinion on such live topies of the day as civil 
instruction, compulsory attendance, course of study, and the readjust- 
ment of school prograinmes; on higher education, kindergartens, manual 
training, physical training, reading and literature, religious and moral 
training, school discipline, and text-books, the whole occupying nearly 
one hundred pages. 
A similar collection of brief paragraphs culled from foreign educa- 
tional periodicals during the year, by Dr. Klemm, as contained in chapter 
XVI, will give anyone an idea of the character of the information 
to be gleaned from foreign journals. In chapter xvi (pp. 1245-1300) 
Dr. Sheldon Jackson reports on the conduct of the schools of Alaska 
for the year, and in chapter Xviit is »given the educational necrology.

  XXII REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
CONCLUSION. 
The three characteristic instruments of modern civilization are the 
railroad, the daily newspaper, and the common school. 
The railroad means the connection of each part of the country with 
_ the market of the world. The newspaper means the participation of 
each man and woman, who can read, in the experience of the human 
race, so that each individual may oratig by the lives of all his fellow 
men far and near. 
The common school means the acquisition on the part of each boy 
and girl, whether rich or poor, of the necessary kilowledge required to 
read the newspaper and when grown to be men and women to make 
use of the railroad to exchange the products of their own industry for 
a share in the products of the world’s industry. 
These implements of human invention are devised: for the sake of 
the general welfare and to promote the cause of democracy. 4 
The modern trend of human history since the discovery of America 
has been slowly moving toward this result. The New World gave a 
great field for adventure and the development of individuality. Adven- 
ture in new Jands and on untried seas has been paralleled and accom- 
panied by adventures in the world of thought and theory. In fact, 
the revival of learning, so called, preceded the epoch of discoveries, and 
this epoch then followed.as a result. The revival of learning and the 
epoch of discovery ushered in the epoch of natural science, which has 
made possible the epoch of useful inventions. 
The epoch of discoveries, too, led to the founding of colonies by the 
most hardy and headstrong among the citizens of western Europe. 
The accidents of birth and wealth do not bear transportation on ships 
that sail to new countries. Only the aristocracy of intellect and will 
power goes for anything in the settlement of a border land. Hence, 
. with the settlement of America, every step has been toward democracy 
and local self-government and toward escape from the trammels of 
caste founded on birth and wealth. 
So great has been the influence of America upon Europe, by way of 
reaction, that all the countries which have furnished immigrants for 
the New World have been drawn toward democracy so far as to have 
constitutional limitations adopted in théir forms of government. This 
has been noteworthy in northern Europe, less so in southern Europe. 
The progress grows more rapid as the Christian spirit which leavens 
our civilization sends forward, one after the other, its legions into the 
field; for great inventions, as well as great moral reforms, proceed 
from Christianity. The discovery of Watt in the last century gave us 
the steam engine. Fitch and Fulton soon applied it to the movement 
of boats; George Stephenson to railroads. In 1830 there were loco- 
motives running between Manchester and Liverpool. 
But evenas late as 1840 there was only a force of two millions of horse 
 
-P-A-G-E-23
THE INSTRUMENTS OF MODERN CIVILIZATION. XXIII 
power derived from steam in the whole world. This doubled by 1850, and 
again doubled by 1860, and still again by 1870. Since 1870 the aggre- 
gate steam power of the world has increased from eighteen millions of 
horse power to sixty millions. About one-third of all the steam power 
in the world is in the United States—some twenty millions of horse 
power. 
Of this vast force which toils for us, two-thirds is in the form of 
locomotives, which connect the back country with the cities and the 
cities with each other. Over twenty millions of horse power mounted 
on wheels in the form of locomotives is now in process of making all 
the people who live in the country sharers in city civilization. The 
people in cities have the advantage of the world’s market and of the 
world’s discoveries in science, art, literature, and history. The city - 
offers to each of its inhabitants the inestimable blessings of society 
with the wise and good. 
Now, it is steam power which has, so te speak, moved the back coun- 
try into the city to the extent of twelve millions of horse power. * What 
the country can produce of agricultural products and mining is made 
of much greater value by cheap transportation. Then, in turn, the 
products of manufactures and the articles that come from around the 
world are made cheaper to the farmer and the miner by the same proc- 
ess of cheap freights and the railroad. ~ ae : 
In 1860 the cost of freight on railroads was 3 and 4 cents a mile for 
each ton; now it is less than 1 cent per mile. 
We have stationary steam engines to the amount of 6,000,000 horse 
power manufacturing goods for us. 
According to Engel, the great German statistician, there were in 1870 
industries to the amount of $32,000,000,000 that depended. on steam for 
their motive power, and at this time there are upward of $50,000,000,000 
invested in industries for which the steam engine gives the force and 
the laborer furnishes only the guiding power. 
Looking at the nations of the world, we can see which are producing 
the wealth and which are democratically lifting up their population into 
a share of the world product of industry by the statistics of their 
steam power. For each thousand inhabitants the United States has a 
steam power of 300 horses. Great Britain is the only nation which 
equals us in the amount of steam power per inhabitant. Germany has 
alittle more than half as much, France less than half, and Russia only 
one-eighth as much, according to population. : 
~ I dwell on this lesson of the steam engine because it is this which is 
making us a wealthy nation. 
In 1800 I find that the total product of each man, woman, and child 
in the United States did not amount to 10 cents a day. In 1850 it had 
increased to 25 cents. In 1880 it amounted to upwards of 40 cents. It 
now comes to nearly, or quite, 50 cents per day.

XXIV REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
  The new census gives us data to prove that the total increase of 
wealth in the last decade, 1880-90, was twenty billions, or an average 
of two billions a year. The increase, to some extent, is due to the 
increase of the value of land near cities and to new farming lands 
brought under cultivation. But far-more of it comes from buildings 
and improvements which have been made by labor, aided by steam. 
The use of machinery in productive industry causes a transfer of 
laborers from agriculture to manufactures and commerce. Weéneed fewer 
persons to obtain for us the raw materials of food, clothing, and shelter. 
More persons can be spared for the elaboration of the material. Fewer 
persons are required to produce the bare necessities of life, and more 
are set to work on articles of luxury and human comfort. More and 
more persons are employed, too, for the care of the spiritual wants 
of protection and culture. 
Ina savage state, only 1 in 100 can be spared for the production of 
articles of luxury and ornament and for protection and culture. In 
the old civilization, before the invention of the steam engine, only 1 
in 20 could be spared for such work. Now we can spare 1 in 10 of the 
population, and we are soon coming to the time when we can set 1 in 5 
to work at the production and distribution of newspapers and books, 
at the use of the telegraph and telephone, the work of teaching and 
preaching and lecturing, and the work of the professions of law and 
medicine, which protect life and property. 
The vocations of man that have for their object the production of 
comfort and ornament and the care for man’s spiritual welfare are 
bound to grow from more to more with the increased application of 
machinery to productive industry, while a smaller proportion of the 
population will be needed for the production of raw material. 
In the statistics of incomes for 1888 my attention has been attracted 
to the increase of comfortable, well-to-do families in those countries 
where the steam engine is much used and where the laborers are edu- 
cated into artistic skill.. Thirty out of every 100 families in Great 
Britain are receiving $1,000 and upward a year. Think of the com- 
forts that can be purchased in London for $1,000. 
France, thanks to its instruction of its people in forms of art, manu- 
factures works of taste and ornament for the world, and 24 per cent of 
its families are receiving $1,400 and upward a year. In England the 
70 per cent of the population remaining receive on an average $500 per 
family, and this means greater luxury than the average nobleman 
enjoyed 300 years ago. But in Italy, with only one-tenth as many 
steam engines per thousand inhabitants as Great Britain, there are only 
one-tenth as many families in the hundred that receive $1,000 a year. 
Ninety-seven per cent of its families get on an average only $300 a year. 
It is important to notice that the machinery of productive industry 
demands educated intelligence to supervise and guide its direction.
-P-A-G-E-25
  THE VALUE OF EDUCATED INTELLIGENCE. XXV- 
This has been one of the causes why the nations of Burope have, one 
after the other, felt the need of adopting national systems of education. 
Especially those like England, France, and Germany have seen that to 
hold the markets of the world itis necessary to develop the intelligence 
of the laboring classes by means of schools. 
A. still deeper lesson was learned by the results of the two wars which 
Prussia carried on, the first one with Austria and the second with 
France. Both of the conquered countries at once set about reforming 
their school systems. Austria has doubled its ratio of school attend- 
ance since the battle of Sadowa, and now has 13 per cent of the popu- _ 
, lation in school. 
France has increased its school attendance to 15 per cent of its pop- 
ulation from the 9 per cent which it had in 1864. Meanwhile, the num- 
ber of illiterate men and women in France has decreased from 58 to 18 ~ 
in the 100. A great French statesman said that it was the German 
universities that conquered at Sedan. 
The alarm at the military success of Prussia aided the English reform- 
ers in carrying through Parliament the radical measures of 1870. Large 
sums of money were given to encourage private schools and the school 
systems of towns. The schools thus aided were teaching at first about 
8 per cent of the population. On the wave of this reform the friends 
of educationsucceeded in August, 1891, in making the schools free to all 
children of the compulsory age. France had done this ten years before. 
The effect of the English effort has been to increase the school enroll- 
ment from 8 per cent to 16 per cent of the population. 
Of the other countries, Italy and Spain, have increased their school 
attendance to over 10 per cent of their respective populations, or to 
double the number enrolled in 1860, and have thereby decreased the 
amount of illiteracy. 
Turning to our own country, one striking item of progress is that 
of the rapid inerease of property used for school purposes. In 1870 
the property for the common schools in the aggregate amounted to 
$130,000,000. In twenty-two years this has increased to $350,000,000, 
or eats exactly $10,000,000 a year on an average. It is interesting 
to note that up to 1888 the London school board had Sees 
$42,000,090 for school buildings. 
More remarkable than this is the increase of school attendance in 
the Southern States. In 1870 the south Atlantic division of States, 
comprising all from Delaware to Florida, enrolled in school.only 6 per 
cent of the entire population. In 1890 the enrollment is 22 per cent or 
1 in 5 of population, The south central States, including. Missouri, 
Kentucky, and West Virginia, and the States south of them, enrolled 
in school only 7$ per cent in 1870, and more than 234 per cent in 1891. 
To understand at their true vane the efforts of the South to make 
their schools what they should be, we ought to remember that the - 
ED 90-—nI Si t 
          
     
-P-A-G-E-26
  XXXVI REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
  wealth which numerous large cities give makes it easy in the North to 
raise money for the support of schools without making a great burden 
for the taxpayers. In the South the taxes are large, but do not yield 
the requisite amount to support the schools for more than 100 days in 
the south Atlantic division, nor for more than 90 days in the south 
central. 
This, of course, is in process of correction, as the present villages 
grow into cities and the States grow wealthy. 
As above shown the average length of school year in the north At- 
lantic division (full of cities) is 166 days; that of the north central 
division is 134 days. The largest enrollment of children in the schools 
is in the north central division, amounting to more than 25 per cent of 
the population. That of north Atlantic and the Pacific coast and 
mountain region falls below the south in proportion enrolled in school. 
This has been partly explained by the fact that children do not consti- 
tute so large a proportion of the population in those sections as in the 
other parts of the nation. 
As a whole, the United States appears as enrolling in school quite 
23 per cent of its entire population. This is a better showing than that 
of any other nation, except Saxony. But many other nations of Europe 
have a much longer annual school session than we have. Here is the 
place to show improvement in future years. ! 
To sum up the results of our outlook, we see the nations of Europe 
first making education of all their people compulsory, and next, after 
some years, but as a logical consequence, making education free. 
We see that there are reasons of self-preservation, both industrial 
and military, which lead to this. In our country the political reason 
was perhaps the first, as it is now the leading motive. We are to gov- 
ern ourselves, and each of us is to help govern the rest. It is obvious 
that the better educated each citizen is the better governed we all 
shall be. 
The introduction of instruction in manual training has become a 
large feature in recent years, and will grow a larger feature in propor- 
tion as cities are called upon to grapple with the population of their 
slums. 
Higher education is becoming more practical in that it studies the 
problems of the people, and endeavors to solve them in the laboratory. 
University extension has a great role yet to perform to connect itself 
with the public libraries growing up everywheré in the cities, and to 
form classes of serious minded men and women throughout the com- 
munity who are anxious to continue their studies for the sake of cul- 
ture or for special preparations in arts. 
In conclusion, I desire to take this opportunity to testify to the val- 
uable services and willing codperation of the corps of this office and in 
particular to recognize the assistance given me by the chief clerk, Mr.

CHAPTER I. 
STATISTICAL EXHIBIT OF EDUCATION IN THE UNITED 
STATES FOR THE YEAR 1889-90. 
GENERAL SUMMARY OF PUPILS. 
The following table shows the whole number of pupils of each grade 
enrolled in the educational system of the United States during the 
school year 1889-901. The pupils in.public and private schools and 
institutions are given separately. 
According to the table, there was enrolled a grand total of 14,512,778 
pupils, as against 13,726,574 in 1888-89, being an increase of 786,204, 
or 5.73 per cent. 
These pupils formed 23.18 per cent of the population of the United 
States, or nearly one-fourth. 
Of the total number, 14,010,533, or 96.54 per cent, were receiving 
elementary instruction; 367,003, or 2.53 per cent, secondary instruction, 
and 135,242, or 0.93 per cent, superior instruction. 
Only atone one pupil in forty is under secondary instruction, and one 
in one hundred and seven under superior instruction. 
As regards percentage of the total population, 22.37 per cent, or one 
in four and one-half of the population, are under elementary instruc- 
tion; 0.58 per cent, or one in one hundred and seventy-two, are under 
secondary instruction, and 0.22 per cent, or one in four hundred and 
fifty-five, are under superior instruction. 
In the preceding Report of this Office (1888-89), the number of pupils 
in public high schools was estimated at 482,000. This estimate was 
based on the partial returns made by State superintendents. The 
number given in the present Report, 221,522, is the result of a special 
inquiry made by the Bureau into public high schools (see Part m1 of 
this Report). In this result all pupils in public high schools pursuing 
only elementary studies are Sod a. é only the really secondary 
taecidaiie evening schools; art, eet and industrial training, trades, and busi- 
ness schools; schools for the defective, dependent, and delinquent classes, and Indian 
schools. These collectively enroll a considerable number of pupils, 
: 1 ED 90-——1
-P-A-G-E-30
    \ 
2 - EDUCATION REPORT, 1839-90, 
pupils are taken into consideration. There are many pupils pursuing 
secondary studies in ungraded or partially graded schools who were 
not reached by this inquiry, which dealt only with public institutions 
formally denominated “high schools.” Both of these considerations 
tend to reduce the number of public high-school pupils reported. 
Of the total number of pupils reported, 12,755,950, or 87.9 per cent, 
are in public schools and institutions, and 1,756,828, or 12.1 per cent, 
in private. e 
Seven-eighths of all the education in the United States is public. The 
proportion of the public, however, varies much in the different grades, 
_ as will be seen from the table.

SUMMARY oF STATISTICS OF THE Common ScHOOLS, 1889-90. 
The following statement is made up from returns for 1889-90, except 
in the case of one or two States, where returns for 1888-89 are used. 
The numbers here given are therefore subject to a slight future correc-

WHOLE NUMBER OF PUPILS (ENROLLMENT). 
Table 2, p. 7, gives, by States, the whole number of different pupils 
enrolled in the common schools in 1870, 1880, and 1890; also a compari- 
son of the school enrollment with the total conieon at ench of these 
dates. 
It will be seen that the whole number of pupils attending the com- 
mon schools of the United States in 1890 was 12,697,196, or 20.27 per 
cent of the total population; there were only 17.82 per cent attending 
in 1870, and 19.67 per cent in 1880; the gain in the last twenty years 
has therefore been considerable. 
This gain, it will be seen from the table, comes altogether from the 
States of the Southern and Western divisions. In the North Atlantic 
and North Central divisions there has been a continuous loss; in the 
former of these two divisions, the percentage of the population enrolled 
as pupils has decreased during the period 1870-1890 from 22.09 to 17.89 
per cent; in the latter from 24,41 to 22.43 per cent. 
This decrease has been heretofore remarked in the Reports of this 
Office, and an attempt made to assign the reasons for it. 
 
-P-A-G-E-37
  STATISTICS OF STATE SYSTEMS. 2 
In Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont, there has been not only a 
relative, but also an absolute decrease in the enrollment, viz: In Maine 
from about 152,400 in 1870 to 139, 676 in 1890; in New Hampshire from 
69,762 in 1870 to 59,813 in 1890; ends in Menngnt from 66,310 in 1870 to 
65, 7608 in 1890. These three a the only States algwine: a positive de- 
crease in enrollment. 
All the North Atlantic States except Rhode Island, however, show 
a loss in enrollment as compared with the population, and seven out of 
the twelve North Central States; the other five—Missouri, the two 
Dakotas, Nebraska, and Kansas—showing considerable gains; these 
five, however, started with a very low percentage of population enrolled 
in 1870, soa gain was to be expected. : 
It was suggested in the last Annual Report of this Bureau (for 
1888-89) that the decrease in the relative number of pupils in the 
Northern States might be duein part to a decrease in the proportion of 
children in the total population. Of course, other things being equal, 
where there is the smallest proportion of children there will be the 
smallest school attendance. Now, the number of children in every one 
hundred persons varies greatly in different States, and may have been 
decreasing in the Northern States since 1870; so that the increase of 
enrollment, while falling behind the increase of population, may still 
have kept pace with the increase of school population (number of chil- 
dren of school age). 
This question can not be completely and definitely settled until the 
census returns of the ages of the population in 1890 are compiled. 
In some States the annual enumerations of the school population fur- 
nish indications as to the increase in the number of children. Take the 
five States, Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, Illinois, and Wis- 
consin, and compare their increase in population, in school population, 
and in number of pupils enrolled in the schools, respectively, from 1870 
to 1890:

It will be inferred from these figures that while in each of the five 
States under consideration there has been a loss in the relative num- 
ber of children, as compared with the total population, there has been 
a still greater loss in the relative number of pupils in all except Massa- 
chusetts. 
That is to say, while the decrease in the proportion of children in this 
   
-P-A-G-E-38
    10 EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
group of States accounts in part for the decrease of the percentage of 
_ the population attending school, it does not, except in the case of Mas- 
sachusetts, wholly account for it. In Massachusetts a somewhat larger 
proportion of the children attend school than in 1870; in the other four 
States a considerably smaller. 
The State of New York is particularly noticeable. While its total 
population has mereased about three-eighths since 1870, and its school 
population about one-fourth, the increase in the number of pupils has 
been insignificant (1.53 per cent). 
DUPLICATE REGISTRATION, 
If the accuracy of the statistics of enrollment were unimpeachable we 
would be forced to the certain conclusion that not so large a proportion 
of the resident children of the Northern States (except in such eases as 
Massachusetts) attend the public schools now as in 1870. But, unfortu- 
nately, the statistics are known to be inaccurate, especially those of 
twenty years ago. The practice of duplicate registration, by no means 
done away with at the present day, was widely prevalent in former 
years, and tended to swell the school enrollment beyond—often far be- 
yond—the true figures. There were not in 1870 so many pupils as re- 
ported. The loss of pupils in the last twenty years may therefore be 
only an apparent loss, due to erroneous statistics; though in such an 
aggravated case as New York, where the school population shows an in- 
erease of 244 per cent, but the enrollment one of only 14 per cent, in 
twenty years, it is difficult to resist the conviction that the decrease in 
school attendance is a real and not an apparent decrease, and such is 
in all probability the fact. 
REPORT TO THE NATIONAL COUNCIL OF EDUCATION. 
The important subject of duplicate registration was considered in de- 
_tail in a report of a committee of the National Council of Education (W. 
T. Harris, chairman), in 1891, which ran as follows: 
The statistics of no country or State can be considered as yet perfectly reliable in 
this item [enrollment or registration]. Here are some of the ways in which dupli- 
cate registration comes in: 
(a) In rural districts a winter school is kept by one teacher, probably a man, and 
in the summer another session is kept, and by a woman. The statistics of these 
schools are reported to the central office of the town and thence to the State, with- 
out making account of the duplicate registration of pupils. The summer school 
registers a large number of new pupils, especially of young children, but retains a 
good many of the winter pupils. 
As towns grow populous the two-session school is supplanted by the continuous- 
term school, and one registration takes the place of two. The States with rural 
districts, which are gradually adopting the continuous-term school, therefore fre- 
quently show a decrease in the annual enrollment of pupils, and seem, therefore, to 
be retrograding, whereas they are improving the quality and quantity of their edu- 
cation by increasing the annual term of school and by engaging better teachers, 
and by actually enrolling a larger number of pupils, though not counting any of 
these twice. 
   
-P-A-G-E-39
  STATISTICS OF STATE SYSTEMS. 11 
(6) But there is another source of duplicate enrollment in the fact that some 
schools, private academies being the first to do this, count each term of the year a 
separate affair, and give the enrollment for each of the three or four terms first in 
detail and then in the aggregate, without deducting duplications. i 
(c) A third and more dangerous form of duplicate enrollment comes from enrolling 
twice those who are promoted from one school to another during the year; they are 
counted once in the primary school, for example, and again in the intermediate or 
grammar school to which they are transferred. This third form of duplicate enroll- 
ment used to vitiate the statistics of the large cities on the Atlantic coast, Philadel- 
phia in one year, for example, counting some 70,000 pupils twice in its returns, and 
making an aggregate of 177,000, when only 107,000 different pupils were actually 
enrolled. 
(d) Another cause of duplication is the neglect to make a matter of registration of 
the item of attendance of a pupilin another school within the same year, when re- 
ceiving him by transfer. The constantly shifting population of a city causes this 
to be a considerable item. 
(e) Lastly, carelessness in keeping the annual register of a large school leads to a 
duplicate enrollment of many pupils who leave in the fall and return to school in 
the spring. Their former attendance has been forgotten by the principal of the 
school. 
There is need for a good device to prevent this duplicate enrollment, which viti- 
ates all conclusions based on the item of actual school attendance. It should be 
required of each teacher to enter in a column after each pupil’s name the fact of 
attendance or nonattendance previously in the same year in any other school in the 
State. 
In all large schools where there are many teachers and many separate roll books © 
kept it should be required by the principal that each teacher should keep a column in 
which he or she writes after each pupil’s name the ‘‘annual-register nugnber,” for 
the pupils enrolled in the annual register should be numbered. This “ annual-reg- 
ister number” will prevent duplicate’ registration in the same school, and will 
facilitate the transfer of items of each separate teacher’s roll book to the general 
register. 
HOW THE DIFFERENT STATES STAND REGARDING NUMBER OF PUPILS 
ENROLLED. 
Of all the States in the Union, Kansas has the largest proportion of 
its population attending school (27.98 per cent), and Wyoming the 
least (11.62 per cent). It is known, however, that there were in 1880° 
twice as many children to the hundred persons in Kansas as in Wyoming, 
so that after all the ratio of children attending school to the whole num- 
ber of children may be about the same in the two States. 
The States of the North Atlantic and Western divisions generally 
have comparatively few children, which accounts for their low percent- 
age of pupils (17.89 and 17.03 per cent of the population, respectively). 
The feature of preponderating interest in the educational history of 
the last twenty years has been the development of the common-school 
system of the South. This movement probably stands without a paral- 
lel. In 1870, in Mississippi and Texas, no traces can be found of the 
existence of a State school system; in several other States the com- 
mon schools were confined principally to the larger cities. At present

of the population than those of the older States of the North, and fur- 
nish to every child an opportunity to acquire at least the essential rudi- 
ments of a school education. = 
The school enrollment of the South Atlantic States, as appears from 
Table 2, increased from 6.26 per cent of the population in 1870 to 19.72 
per cent in 1890; that of the South Central States from 7.49 per cent 
in 1870 to 21.02 per cent in 1890, 
In each case the principal part of the development took place pre- 
vious to 1880. In the decade from 1880 to 1890 the systems were rounded 
out and carried well on toward completion. 
West Virginia, Tennessee, and Mississippi each now enrolls more than 
one-fourth of its population in its common schools; Virginia, Flor- 
ida, Kentucky, and Texas more than one-fifth. 
Louisiana as yet enrolls less than one-eighth (12.09 per cent), though 
in that State also notable progress has been made during the last two 
decades.

AVERAGE NUMBER OF PUPILS (AVERAGE DAILY ATTENDANCE), 
The average number of pupils daily attending the common schools of 
the United States in 1889-90 was 8,144,938, or 64.1 per cent of the 
whole number of pupils enrolled. 
In other words, each pupil enrolled attended school on an average 
64,1 days out of every 100 days the schools were in session. In 1870 it 
was 59.3 days, and in 1880 62.3 days, thus showing an increasing regu- 
larity of attendance. 
The regularity of attendance is nearly uniform in all sections of the 
country, the average attendance being a little more than five-eighths 
the enrollment. 
Minnesota stands phenomenally low in this respect. This State alone 
enjoys the distinction of having an average attendance less than one- 
half its enrollment. This can hardly be the case in reality. There is 
no reason why Minnesota should stand so far below all other States in 
point of regularity of school attendance. The anomaly is probably 
due to some peculiar method of ascertaining the average attendance in 
that State; a comparison of the average expenditure per pupil in Min- 
nesota and other States, made in a subsequent table, leads to the same 
inference. :

AGGREGATE ATTENDANCE, LENGTH OF SCHOOL TERM, ETC. 
The total number of days attended by all pupils is given in column 
2 of the preceding table. From this it is seen that the total number of 
days attended in 1889-90 was 1,094,352,449, or an average of 86.2 days 
for each pupil enrolled (column 3). 
The average length of the school term in 1870, 1880, and 1890 is given 
in columns 4, 5, and 6. In 1890 it averaged 134.3 days for the United 
States, an increase of 2.1 days over 1870. 
This does not so well exhibit the increase in the length of school 
term which has taken place, as will be the case if the different divisions 
are considered separately. In the North Atlantic States the school 
term has increased from 148.9 days, 1870, to 166.6, in 1890, a very nota- 
ble gain; in the North Central States from 129.9 days, in 1870, to 147.9 
days, in 1890, a still greater gain. The States of the Western division 
show a gain nearly as large. The multiplication of country schools, 
mainly of short term, in the South has, however, kept the average 
school term of the United States nearly stationary. In 1880, indeed, 
it was less than in 1870. 2 
In the two Southern divisions the average school term was less in 1880 
than 1870. This is owing to the circumstance that there were in the 
South a larger proportion of long-term city schools in 1870 than in 1880. 
In fact, as has been stated before, the “average length of the school 
term” in the United States, as well as in individual States, depends 
largely on the ever varying proportion of city and country schools (i. e., 
long-term and short-term schools), and hence fails to possess due signi- 
ficance. The addition of new city schools to a State system lengthens 
the average term without there having been necessarily any change of 
term in the schools previously established. A classification into city 
and country schools, in matter of school term, is greatly needed. 
There have been two notable cases of actual lengthening the school 
terms during the year 1889-90. In New York the length of the school 
term in rural districts was changed by act of legislature from 28 to 32 
weeks, thus increasing the average term of the State from 1774 to 1864 
days; and in Georgia a large increase in the State appropriation for 
schools had the effect of increasing the average school term of the State 
from 70.4 to 83.3 days, with prospect of still greater increase the ensuing 
year. 
Column 7 of the table shows a loss during the past year of thirty days 
in the average school term of Florida. The school term of that State, 
however, is very roughly estimated by the State superintendent, and it 
is not probable that so great a loss has been actually experienced. 
Louisiana shows a gain of 11.8 days, and Oregon of 14.3 days.

PRIVATE SCHOOLS—TOTAL ENROLLMENT IN ALL SCHOOLS. 
The total number of pupils in private schools of primary and second- 
ary grade in the United States is estimated at 1,611,200; this, added to 
the public-school enrollment, gives a grand total of 14,308,396 pupils  
-P-A-G-E-45
  STATISTICS OF STATE SYSTEMS, 17 
enrolled in both public and private schools of elementary and secondary 
grades, or 22.85 per cent of the total population. 
Private-school pupils form 11.26 per cent, or about one-ninth, of the 
total enrollment in all schools of those grades (column 5). The propor- 
tion of private pupils is greatest in New Jersey (16.81 per cent) and 
least in Oregon (9.45 per cent). In general, there is a greater propor- 
tion of private pupils in the North than in the South. 
The estimate of the number of private-school pupils in the United 
States is based upon the reports of State superintendents in eighteen 
States. In very few of these States is the private-school enrollment 
fully reported. In Michigan, for instance,‘one county is credited with 
only four pupils, a county in Montana with only one, and a county in 
Mississippi with only five. Those counties from which no reports at 
all are tabulated in the State reports are given by the Bureau the same 
number of pupils as the average of the rest of the State. 
In the same way the States from which no information has been fur- 
nished have been given the same number of pupils as the average of 
the other States in the same division. 
There can be scarcely any doubt that the result is considerably téo 
small, and should be increased at least one-fourth or one-fifth. This 
would place the number of private-school pupils below the superior 
grade in the United States at about 2,000,000. 
The difficulties of collecting private-school. statistics have been well 
exemplified in Massachusetts the past year.. That State has a law 
requiring all persons in charge of private schools to make report to the 
State board. Blank forms of inquiry were sent out by the State super- 
intendent through the school committees of towns, as that seemed the 
only practicable way of executing the law, in ne absence of specific 
information concerning the name, Weekes or even the existence of 
private institutions. Replies were received from only 125 towns out of 
351. Of these 125 there were 45 that reported no private schools. “It 
is probable,” the State School Report says, ‘‘that the returns received 
cover less than one-half the children attending parochial schools 
throughout the State. This, however, is only conjectured.” : 
The statistics of private schools, as furnished by State superintend- 
ents, are in general of such varying degrees of imperfection from year 
to year that they furnish no reliable basis for determining to what 
extent the private are gaining upon the public schools. Any apparent. 
gain in recent years may very probably be attributed to more complete 
returns of private-school pupils. 
Full and accurate returns of private schools are a sine qua non in 
ascertaining the extent of the diffusion of education. Any exhibit 
which does not include such schools must remain an imperfect and unsat- 
isiactory one.

  STATISTICS OF STATE SYSTEMS. 23 
SOURCES OF SCHOOL REVENUE. 
(Tables 9 and 10.\ 
The total amount raised for the support of common schools in 1889-90 
was $143,110,218, being an average of $2.29 for each person of the pop- 
ulation. s 
Of this $2.29 per capita of the population, 12 cents, or 5.45 per cent 
of the whole, represented the interest upon permanent invested school 
funds. The total amount so raised was $7,797,927, being the income 
from school funds amounting to about $129,000,000. 
From State taxes were derived 42 cents per eapita, or 18.30 per cent 
of the whole, and from local taxes $1.55 per capita, or 67.89 per cent of 
the whole. 
The total amount raised by taxation, then, was $1.97 per capita of the 
population, or 86.19 per cent (about seven-eighths) of the total revenues. 
The gross amount so raised was $123,326,866, 
The remaining portion, some $12,000,000, being 8.36 per cent of the 
whole, was derived from other sources than those specified in the fore- 
going. 
Revenue from permanent funds.—Pennsylvania and North and South 
Carolina have no permanent school funds. In some of the new States 
of the West the permanent fund did not become available in season to 
yield any revenue tor the school year 1889-90, 
Of all the States, Nevada derives the largest revenue, in proportion 
to its population, from its permanent school fund, viz, $1.13 per capita. 
This is more than twice that of any other State. There are nine States 
(in the South) that have a less school revenue from all sources, in pro- 
portion to their population, than Nevada gets from ite permanent 
invested funds alone. North and South Carolina have less than half 
as much in all, and Georgia just about one-half. a 
Except Nevada, no State has a revenue from its permanent fund of 
more than 50 cents per capita. Texas, Nebraska, and Oregon have be- 
tween 40 and 50 cents (Table 10, column 2), Delaware has 38 cents. 
Texas has the largest absolute income from its school fund, amount- 
ing to $885,000. Missouri has also over $800,000, and Illinois over 
$700,000. The latter State, however, depends less on its school fund, 
raising about sixteen times as much in other ways, whereas Texas 
raises by taxation, etc., less than three times as much as its school fund 
yields. 
In the North Atlantic States an average of only about 2 per cent of 
the total revenue comes from permanent funds; in the South Central 
States 13 per cent. 
State school taxes.—A State tax, as here understood, is a tax levied 
on all the property of the State, the proceeds of which are distributed 
among the counties, towns, or districts in the main according to the 
number of children of school age. 
 
-P-A-G-E-52
  24 EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. x The object of this tax is to equalize the burden of school taxation, 
The richer counties, towns, etc., are made through it to contribute of 
their surplus; the poorer receive, and are thus enabled to prolong their 
school term to any required statutory limit without having recourse to 
excessive local taxation. 
State taxes are, almost without exception, devoted by legislative 
enactments solely to maintaining the schools; in fact, are generally 
limited to paying teachers’ salaries. All funds for building and equip- 
ping must be raised locally. The proceeds of any State’s tax, together 
with the income from its permanent school fund, combined in some 
cases with other miscellaneous funds, constitute generally the “State 
apportionment.” 
In some States, instead of a State school tax being levied, an appro- 
priation in bulk is made from the State treasury. This has the same 
effect as a tax specially levied for schools. 
The theory of the State tax has now been accepted by nearly all the 
States of the Union. Indeed, in most of the Southern and some of the 
Western States the State tax dates from the origin of the system, and 
to-day State moneys furnish the main, if not the whole, support of the 
country schools of certain sections of the South. It has been gradually 
adopted by the Northern States, until now Vermont, Massachusetts, 
Towa, Kansas, Colorado, Oregon, and some of the, recently admitted 
States are the only ones which have no distinctively State tax. 
The legislatures of Rhode Island, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Alabama, 
and Illinois appropriate a lump sum annually instead of levying a State 
tax. In nearly all these States the appropriation has been from time to 
time increased. Georgia increased its State appropriation in 1889 by 
$165,000, a again in 1890 by $215,000. Pennsylvania subsequent to 
the date of this Report has largely added to its State appropriation. 
(The State appropriation of Pennsylvania for 1890-91 was $2,000,000 
and that for 1891-92 was $5,000,000.) 
The tendency in the North is to regard State aid a» an auxiliary 
agency having a well-defined function, but to keep it vithin restricted 
bounds. In education, as in the other departments of human activity, 
it is self-help that stimulates the healthiest and most vigorous growth 
and leads to the most enduring results. A realizing sense of this truth 
has led to the practice in the North of being somewhat chary in the 
matter of giving State aid. Enough is furnished to tone down the 
harsher inequalities of local taxation and to afford a stimulus and an 
encouragement to the people in the poorer localities to do for them- 
selves. 
Still, the figures show (Table 10, column 3) that the North raises in 
the shape of State taxes per capita about as much as the South. The 
difference between the two sections is that in the North the State tax 
is a mere auxiliary, as before stated; in the South the proceeds of it, 
together with the income from the invested school funds, is the main—in 
 
-P-A-G-E-53
  STATISTICS. OP STATE SYSTEMS. 25 
the country often the only—source of school support, and generally an 
inadequate one. What is a merely incidéntal source of supply in the 
North is made in the South the chief reliance, 
To be more explicit: Combining the income from permanent funds 
of column 7, Table 10, with the State taxes of column 8, which together 
make up the bulk of the State apportionments of school moneys, it will 
be seen that in the North Atlantic Division the States furnish 17.11 
per cent, and in the North Central Division 17.61 per cent, of the total 
school revenue, the remainder being locally furnished; so it may be 
said that in the North the States furnish on an average about one- 
sixth of the school support, and in the present temper of the governing 
authorities it is not likely that this proportion will be largely exceeded, - 
though the falling into line of the States which as. yet have no State 
tax will increase the average slightly, perhaps to.20 per cent. This 
may be regarded as the present-day opinion in the North as to the 
maximum of what the State should do for the direct financial support 
of the schools, é. ¢., one-fifth of the whole, leaving four-fifths to local 
enterprise. 
On the other hand, in the South Atlantic States, the State appor- 
tionments, while being about as much per capita of population as in 
the North, comprise 46.39 per cent, and in the South Central States 
65.23 per cent, of the total school revenues; %. ¢., the Southern States 
furnish about as much State moneys per capita, on the whole, as the 
Northern, but in the South the local or extra;State revenues are very 
meager, as will be seen from column 4, where itis shown that the States 
of the northern divisions raise on an average over $2 per capita of 
population in local taxes, and those of the two Southern divigions on an 
average about 36 cents (46 and 27 cents), 
These figures emphasize the difference in.the school systems of the 
two sections, viewed in their financial bearings. It may be also real- 
ized from a consideration of the following: The three divisions com- 
prising the Northern and Pacific States contain about 43,000,000 peo- 
ple and raise about $90,000,000 in local school taxes; the two Southern 
divisions contain about 20,000,000 inhabitants and raise $7,000,000 
local school taxes. That is, the former group, with only about twice 
the number of people that the latter has, raises about thirteen times as 
much local school taxes. 
The school financial system of California is especially noticeable; 
that State has not only pushed State control of text-books to its extreme 
limit, but it furnishes direct support.to its schools to the extent of 
$1.99 per capita of population, more than three times as much as any other 
State, except New Jersey, with its $1.38 per capita; Tennessee, 73 cents 
per capita, and Texas, 75 cents. But the so-called State tax of New Jer- 
sey is not a State tax in the proper sense of the term, since 90 per cent 
of itis returned to the counties where collected. Indiana and Ken- 
tucky raise 66 cents per capita in State taxes; New York and Mary-~ 
land, 54 cents; South Dakota, 53 cents, and Maine, 51 cents.
-P-A-G-E-54
  : 26 EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90, 
The above ten are the only States that raise over 50 cents per capita 
_ in State taxes. . 
As to Kentucky—Enough State aid.Superintendent Thompson, after 
_Showmg how much the State aid has increased of late years, goes on 
to say: “All this, however, has not brought about that result on which 
depends the ultimate success of the public-school system, namely, a 
corresponding increase in local aid ;” what there is, is contributed mainly 
by the cities; “of that contributed by the counties, but a small propor- 
tion was used for increasing the salaries of teachers and lengthening the 
school term, the rest representing incidental expenses, schoolhouse- 
buildings, etc. * * * Ithascome to be a matter of common com- 
plaint, therefore, that the State bonus is so great as to deter local effort, 
the people being able to employ teachers for the minimum (statutory) 
school term by payment of the amount drawn from the public (State) 
treasury. The remedy for this suicidal policy is not to be found in an 
increase of the State fund, * * * but in that general awakening 
of the people to their vital interests, which will incline them to con- 
tribute liberally of their own means, by subscription and by local taxa- 
tion. * * * While Kentucky as a State has made noble provision 
for her pupil children, the fullest benefits of her munificence can never 
be realized until every community is alive to the fact that its progress, 
its prosperity, its very safety depend upon local effort, local means, 
local supervision. Few States have as large a school per capita as Ken- 
tucky, derived directly from taxation; but many maintain a public- 
school system strong, efficient, progressive, by means of city, county, 
and district taxation and subscription. With them, the State per caput 
is the least important consideration.” 
In some*parts of the South the “ State poll tax” is retained in the 
counties where collected, so that it is not a State tax in the most re- 
stricted sense of the term. Neither is it a voluntary local tax. It has 
been deemed best on the whole to keep it classed with State taxes, to 
which it seems most nearly allied. 
Local taxes.—The amount of local school tax measures in a general 
way the amount of local interest taken in the schools, and hence indi- 
cates the vigor and efficiency with which they are conducted. 
As California is preéminently the home of the State tax, so is Massa- 
chusetts, though not in so marked a degree as compared with other 
States, the home of the local tax. Massachusetts raised in 1889-90 in 
local taxes $3.62 per capita of population, or 96.62 per cent of its total 
~school revenue. The remaining 3.38 per cent was the income of its 
small school fund, except an insignificant sum derived from voluntary 
contributions. The average local tax for the United States is $1.55 
per capita. 
Colorado, with $3.59 per capita local taxes, closely approximates to 
Massachusetts, and Iowa in a less degree with $3.10. The above three 
_ are the only States having over $3.  
-P-A-G-E-55
  STATISTICS OF: STATE SYSTEMS. 27 
The meager local school taxes of the South have been before ad- 
verted to. The figures of column 4 of Table 10 confirm the conclusions 
that may be deduced from a general study of the situation, viz, that 
the common schools of the South outside the larger cities are an exotic 
growth, springing up under the stimulus of sustenance received from 
the State treasury, and are not the indigenous products of the soil. 
North Carolina raises in local taxes for common schools only 1 cent 
per capita of population: South Carolina, 5 cents; Georgia, 18 cents; 
Tennessee, 13 cents; Alabama, 19 cents; and Texas, 17 cents. 
It is proper to say, however, that all the local school taxes of the 
Southern States are not reported tothe respective State superintendents, 
and consequently by them to this Office. Effort has been made to supply 
the omissions, when known to occur, by having recourse to city reports 
or to estimates. Contributions to an unknown extent are also made in 
the shape of labor and material for building schoolhouses, rent of 
buildings for school purposes, ete. All these items taken into consider- 
ation, however, would not alter to any considerable extent the figures 
given.

SCHOOL EXPENDITURE. 
(Tables 11 to 15.) 
The total expenditure for common schools advanced from $63,396,666 
in 1870 to $78,094,687 in 1880 and to $140,277,484 in 1890. 
The gain in school expenditure from 1870 to 1880 was therefore 23.2 
per cent, but from 1880 to 1890 it was 79,6 per cent. The gain in total 
population during the same two decades was 30.1 per cent and 24.9 per 
cent respectively. 
Thus the school expenditure did-not increase as fast as the popula- 
tion did from 1870 to 1880, but outran the population at an extraor- 
dinary rate in the decade from 1880 to 1890. 
This is further shown by considering the expenditure per capita of 
population at the three epochs, as given in Table 11, columns 5, 6, and 
7; in 1870 the per capita expenditure was $1.64; in 1880 it was 81, 56, 
while in 1890 it had risen to $2.24. 
Such largely increased liberality, or, it may be said, such owe 
profusion, in the expenditure of public funds on the common schools 
ED 90——_3

  —(B4 EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
indicates a fixed determination on the part of the people to render 
these schools as good as money can make them. The result may be 
_ seen in the increased architectural beauty of the school buildings of 
to-day as compared with the structures, plain almost to repulsive- 
ness, which existed as a rule a generation ago; in the greatly improved 
arrangements for heating and ventilation, and the better and more 
abundant apparatus, libraries, and material adjuncts generally; and 
above all in the higher grade in the teaching and supervising force. 
All these effects have been produced through a larger liberality in 
expenditure; not the least of the benefits accruing therefrom has been 
to render the public schools more formidable competitors of the private 
schools and to stimulate the latter to rival the former. The large ma- 
jority of the parents of the land will aim to send their children to the 
best schools,-and the private schools, in order to retain their patronage, 
will have to elevate themselves to the plane of the public schools in the 
particulars above mentioned as well as in the standard of their course of 
study and in their general efficiency. 
The amount paid for salaries of teachers and superintendents has 
increased 63.9 per cent in the past ten years; during the same period 
the number of teachers has increased only 27 per cent, about the same 
as the population. Each individual teacher, therefore, receives on an 
average a larger amount per annum than ten years ago. As a matter 
of fact, the average amount received by each teacher was $195 in 1880 
and-$252 in 1890. 
The expenditure ‘for new schoolhouses and permanent improvements 
has undergone an extraordinary expansion during the past year in the 
North Atlantic States; the nine States composing this group expended 
for new buildings and appliances $10,860,263, being an increase of 
$2,311,472, or 27.04 per cent over the preceding year. (Table 12, column 
4.) At that annual rate this expenditure, large already, would more 
than double itself in three years. Taking individual States, New Hamp- 
shire increased her expenditure for school houses and apparatus 81 per 
cent, or nearly doubled it; Massachusetts, 70.47 per cent; New York, 
20.17 per cent; and Pennsylvania, 33.32 per cent. The increase alone 
the past year, in each of the three last-mentioned States, is equal to 
more than half the whole permanent expenditure in either the South 
Atlantic or South Central Division. 
In the South Atlantic States there has been a falling off of 17.04 
per cent, or more than one-sixth, in the permanent expenditure. This 
movement will probably be reversed the ensuing year. 
Of the total $140,277,484 expended for common schools, $26,291,796, 
or 18.7 per cent, were expended for permanent improvements; 
$91,683,338, or 65.4 per cent, for salaries; and $22,302,350 or 15.9 per 
cent, for other current purposes. 
_ The total expenditure averaged $2.24 for each person of the popula. 
tion and $17.22 for each pupil attending school.
-P-A-G-E-63
  * STATISTICS OF STATE SYSTEMS. 3S 
California and Colorado each expend for schools more than $4 per 
capita of population. Next come the District of Columbia and Masga- 
chusetts, with $3.93 and $3.70 resp@ctively. Seven States of the North 
Central Division, and Arizona and Nevada in the Western Division 
also have over $3. _ 
California expended more than any other State for tuition, viz, $3.03 
per capita of population, and Colorado, more for schoolhouses, $1.47 
per capita. Colorado expended more per capita for schoolhouses alone — 
than did twelve of the States for all purposes. 5 
The amount expended per pupil ranged from $43.43 in Colorado to 
$3.38 in South Carolina.

  CHAPTER II. 
REPORT ON THE EDUCATIONAL CONGRESSES AND EXHI- 
BITION HELD IN PARIS IN 1889. 
By W. H. Widgery, 
Assistant Master at University Collego School, London. 
  
LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL, 
To the COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION, U.S.: : 
Srr: I have the honor to lay before you a report on educational mat. 
ters at the Paris Exhibition in 1889, The range of the questions dis- 
cussed, the wealth and variety of the objects exhibited, make a full’ 
account almost impossible. I have striven to give the salient points, 
with such references to the copious and valuable literature, published ° 
mainly by the Government, as may enable a student interested in any 
special point to pursue his inquiries further. 
The spectacle of a nation raising itself triumphantly from unexampled 
disaster can not fail to arouse and enlist the sympathies of every man. 
Education has been universally looked on as the great regenerator; 
during the last decade a system of education, more coherent and close 
knit than any other in the world, has been loyally accepted by the 
country from the hands of a small body of pedagogic reformers. 
The solutions of difficult educational problems made by a highly cen-. 
tralized government, regarding as its supreme aim the full and free 
development of all the forces, physical, intellectual, and moral, of its 
citizens, must needs be of interest and importance to men of Eng. — 
lish race, who are jealous of state interference and look on the private 
initiative of the individual as the main cause of their greatness. Ata 
universal exhibition the nations meet together for mutual improvement. 
France may justly complain of neglect from many quarters, but her own 
work, due to an intense logical sense coupled with the intellectual eour- 
age to put into action whatever the’mind sees to be right, only stands 
out the clearer; to other nations wedded to the anomalies caused by an 
exclusive GS enace to historic precedent, she has given a necessary 
corrective and the means of understanding her own point of view. 
Among nations, as among men, when once the way to a thorough under- 
standing has been opened up, action is not far off, and this the Paris 
Centenary, as far at least as education is concerned, aL fairly claim 
to have evoked. 
I have the honor to be, sir, yours obediently, 
W. H. WipcrEry.

  44 EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90, 
A.—THE CONGRESS ON PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EDU- 
CATION. 
Section I.—InrRopuctory. 
After the disasters of 1806, Prussia, crushed and dismembered, with- 
out hope of foreign aid, was forced to seek within herself the sources 
of her own revival. “We have lost our lands,” cries Friedrich Wil- 
helm III; “abroad our power and our glory have fallen; but it is our 
duty and our desire to strive to regain power and glory at home. My 
chief wish is that the greatest attention be paid to the education of 
the people.” 
The control of the school began to pass from the church to the State; 
teaching was raised to a profession and made secular, entrance being 
regulated by a special examination. Aided by Schleiermacher and Siiv- 
ern, W. von Humboldt, with an energy that profound belief alone can 
eall forth, embodied in the education of Prussia Welt’s conception of 
the teacher as the high priest of ancient culture. ¥ 
Among the considerations urged in support of the draft that after- 
wards became the important edict of July 12, 1810, we find these elo- 
- quent words of Humboldt: “Education as a whole is honored in the 
State, when every man engaged in it is bound to show his capacity.be- 
as forehand. Those who devote themselves to teaching, and who form, as 
it were, with the approval of the public, a closed circle, develop in time 
a feeling which, while free from any narrow corporate spirit, presses 
forward firmly and surely to a common goal. A pedagogic school and 
ee a pedagogic fraternity will arise; if it is important to be on our guard 
against a unity of opinion obtained by compulsion, it is none the less 
important by means of a certain community of interests, incapable of 
conception unless clements that do not rightly belong to it are excluded, 
to arouse a force and enthusiasm, lacking to individual and scattered 
activity; and this community of interests can reject the bad, raise and 
direct the mediocre, and lend wings and strength to the progress even 
~ of the best.” 
With her physical forces developed by the turbulent genius of Jahn, 
Germany found her justification in the “ année terrible,” the fiery bap- 
tismal year of a new France. x / 
Seattered throughout the exhibition were many onak aie statistical 
diagrams; for thred years after the war the lines fall and then steadily 
rise, often, as in the case of education, almost perpendicular, testifying 
to a marvelous fecundity. and recuperative power. The reader whose 
ideas of the French Revolution are derived from the moving accidents of

  EDUCATIONAL CONGRESSES AT PARIS IN 1889. 45 
a popular history will find his views profoundly modified when he studies 
the whole work of the convention in educational matters. Directly 
France has a republican form of government, education comes to the 
fore; with a monarchy it is hedged aside or malignantly crippled by 
cunningly devised regulations; but even when the times are out of joint 
men like Guizot and Duruy can realize some of the hopes of the revolu- 
tion. 
Like Germany, France has turned her most serious attention to edu- 
cation. She has followed the same development and carried it much 
further; indeed, she seems to have crowded into the last ten years the 
work of a century. Instead of watching the slow patchwork mending 
of ancient institutions, we see orders, decrees, and laws, touching some 
of them the very foundations of society, pass before us in swift succes- 
sion like the rapidly moving scenes of some great drama, 
Through the law of June 1, 1878, 500,000,009 francs were spent on 
school buildings; in 1878 the Musée pédagogique was founded; on Au- - 
gust 9, 1879, every department was ordered to provide a training col- 
lege foe men and for women. 
By the law of December 11, 1880, apoenadcedig schools were made 
an integral part of primary Bateau On June 16, 1881, school fees 
were abolished and teachers compelled to obtain a eda pare certificate. 
On March 28, 1882, education was made unsectarian, the clergy being 
deprived of their right of inspection, and attendance at school became 
compulsory. On March 20, 1883, all the communes and villages were 
ordered to provide suitable school buildings. On October 30, 1836, the 
organization of education was carefully settled, while on July 19, 1889, 
the keystone of the whole system was fixed when the salaries of the 
teachers were regulated.* The activity of the law, however, was not 
confined to primary education. On February 7, 1880, a law due to 
Jules Ferry constituted the high council of public education, a consul- 
tative body at the right hand of the minister; the members are nomi- 
nated by the President or elected by their peers; the humblest teacher 
in the land has his representative in this pedagogic parliament. On 
December 20 of the same year the famous law of Camille Sée made the 
proper education of girls a matter for the state. By a decree of De- 
cember 28, 1885, the isolated faculties were brought into harmonious 
working order under a high council of the faculties. 
To what fundamental idea are we to ascribe this phenomenal activity 
of the state in educational matters? —~ > 
Hf we follow M. Marion in his striking monograph on the “‘Movement 
of Pedagogic Ideas in France,” we shall say that “the idea of the rights 
and duties of the state in matters of education has triumphed bril- 
liantly. The idea of Condorcet and Lakanal, forgotten under the Em- 
pire, disgraced under the restoration, taken up with authority by 
Guizot, and partly realized in the law of 1833; the idea whose accom-

plishment lay in Carnot’s project of 1848; the idea stifled in 1850 by 
_ the deadliest of reactions; valiantly resuscitated by M. Duruy, but in. 
vain; lovingly elaborated by M. Jules Simon and always condemned to 
wait, until the final advent of the republic compelled every one to see 
clearly that to make primary education compulsory was the necessary 
guaranty of social order and the recovery of the country.” 
The three cardinal points of the reform in France are that primary 
education should be compulsory, free, and secular. The historical 
development, however, did not exactly follow the logical. If the state 
demands the first, it must grant the other two. We can not say to a 
_ man “Take this or we’ll punish you,” and then claim payment for the 
- gift; we must in addition make the gift good, and therefore carefully 
train the teacher. Since it is impossible in every district to make a 
separate school for each separate religious body, the teaching in the 
compulsory school must be secular. This does not exclude morality, 
_ Which is as necessary to the state as salt is to the sea. Religion, the 
private concern of each individual, belongs to the clergy and the 
family. : 
Not only has M. Ferry shown the antithesis “either confessional 
religion or atheism” to be false, but he has restored to the teacher the 
fairest portion of his task. 
- What answer has the country made to this puissant impulsion from 
above? What will be the outcome of this energy and passion that we 
feel moving and surging under the formal covering of law? The answer 
. lies in the future, but the spring is so full of vigorous shoots that we 
may fairly make a hopeful forecast for the autumn. h 
We need not hesitate for lack of material. The Government seems 
only too eager to supply the means for following and criticising its acts. 
‘The six volumes of the Reeucil des monographies pédagogiques publiées 
a Voecasion de Vexposition universelle de 1889 form the testament of the 
belief of the Government in education. The sixty monographs cover 
a wide range of history, administration, and method. That part of 
education which can be embodied in visible form, was shown in 
bewildering wealth at the exhibition. The progress of pedagogic sci- 
ence, forever making and never made, was provided for by two con- 
gresses, one covering primary education and the other secondary and 
higher education. Indeed, it rained congresses: Physical exercise in 
education, technical education for commerce and industry, bibliography 
of mathematical sciences, chemistry, physiological psychology, geogra- 
phy, ete. 
We shall endeavor to supplement an account of the two congresses 
and the exhibition specially affecting education, with such other mat- 
ters as may be of interest to teachers. In the hope of keeping the 
aceount clear, the order of time in which the various educational ques- 
tions were discussed has been neglected.

EDUCATIONAL CONGRESSES AT PARIS IN 1889. | 47 
Section Il.—TuwE SorBonNE. 
The culminating point of the fruitful codperation of state and city is 
to be found in the palatial edifice of the new Sorbonne, solemnly inaug- 
urated by the President of the Republic on August5, The impressive 
ceremony will remain vivid in the memories of all who were fortunate 
enough to be present. , 
Robert de Sorbon, born in the first year of the thirteenth century, 
the son of ‘a father and mother of low condition,” obtained from Louis 
IX in 1250 or 1256 the gift of a house in which to lodge his pawvres 
escholiers while they received a free education from various groups of 
“secular ecclesiastics.” 
The great reconstruction by Richelieu has been surpassed in grandeur 
by the new buildings, of which the foundation stone was laid only four ~~ 
years ago. When completed the Sorbonne will cover about 6$ acres. 
It will be the home of the Academy of Paris, the faculty of letters and 
the faculty of sciences. 
The story of the many delays and sacrifices necessary to carry on 
the great work may be found in the last volume of I. Gréard’s Education 
et instruction. 
The enormous amphitheater, capable of seating 3,000 persons, was 
filled to overflowing by the élite of France, the strangers who had come 
to take part in the congresses on education, the French students and 
their guests. 
This human hemicycle of young life fringed the dense mass in the 
center of men who had made their mark in life. The youth of the 
world was there and it seemed as if the university of the thirteenth 
century had come back to witness its second birth. The nations 
were there linked in a common bond as students and seekers after 
truth. What living breath had changed an administrative machine, 
set and kept in motion by the omnipotence of the state, but destined 
only to imprint an official: hall-mark on intellectual goods, into a living 
personality? The place of the impalpable University of France will 
be taken by local flesh and blood at Paris, at Lyons, at Bordeaux; the 
virtues that~ spring out of corporate life will be found again. As 
science is common to the whole world this corporate life among students 
from all countries will tend to rise higher and higher towards the clear 
uplands of truth. 
The president on his arrival was received by M. Armand Falliéres, 
the minister of public education and the fine arts, M. Gréard, the vice- 
rector of the Academy of Paris, and M. Liard, the director of higher 
education. ' 
The whole assembly stood while the band played the Marseillaise. 
At the wish of the students it was given a second time and they sang 
it while the foreign banners were waved to salute the French. 
    
     
-P-A-G-E-76
        48 a EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
The keynote of the opening address of M. Gréard* was the praise 
of the University of Paris, Parisius sine pari. Students came from all 
parts of Europe because there “the love of truth was the sole rule. 
known.” The love of truth, what higher aim can any teaching body 
put before itself? Since Spinoza claimed the libertas philosophandi is 
any other possible? If we permit any barrier whatever to free inves- 
tigation, we acquiesce in closing up one of the avenues to truth. 
As though to remind the auditory that the Sorbonne was destined for 
the severe study of science M. Gréard’s discourse was followed by a 
learned account, from M. Hermite, of the works of the various mathe- 
matical professors at the Sorbonne since 1808. 
Next came M. Chautemps, the president of the Paris municipal 
council, who, in the course of his speech, said: “To affirm the interest 
taken in the cause of higher education by the representatives of the 
_ people of Paris would be superfluous; for that purpose the sacrifices 
- agreed to for the reconstruction of the Sorbonne are eloquent; they 
bear witness that in our eyes the power and prosperity. of a country 
are intimately bound up with the life it makes possible for its scholars, 
its writers, its artists, and that the money devoted to the development 
of higher studies is transmuted not only into industrial progress, but 
also into an eleyation of the moral and intellectual standard of the 
whole nation, multiplying a hundred fold the value of each individual 
and giving anation the superiority over its rivals.” 
He was followed by M. Falliéres, who saw in the devotion of the re- 
public to education its surest claim to the gratitude of posterity. The 
French democracy, scarcely free and mistress of itself, recognized with 
a sure instinct a great regenerative force in science. Hager as it ought 
to be for the education of the people, it saw that primary instruction 
was but a canal to distribute the waters that come from a higher source, 
and that the higher the source was the further and deeper would the 
waters spread and penetrate. 
After touching on the history of the universities since the revolution 
and noting the lack of coherence among the different faculties, the 
speaker made an eloquent appeal to the young students to put an end 
to quarrels and divisions and in a higher region of thought and action 
to find common ground in a common love for truth and country. 
After the ceremony the students, grouped in nations, defiled before

EDUCATIONAL CONGRESSES AT PARIS IN 1889. 49 
SEcrron Ill.—Tur ConGRESS OF PRmmaRyY INSTRUCTION. 
Next day M. Gréard opened the Congress on Secondary and Higher 
Education and a few days later the one on Primary Education. 
The success and smoothness of both must be largely attributed to 
the admirable way in which the preliminaries had been arranged and 
the ground cleared. 
An order of December 11, 1888, nominated the commission for pri- 
mary education. M.Gréard was chosen president, MM. Buisson and Ol- 
lendorff the vice-presidents, and M. Lenient, assisted by M. Defodon, 
the secretaries. The three questions chosen for discussion were— 
(1) In what form and to what extent can professional instruction 
(agricultural, industrial, commercial) be given in elementary and higher 
primary schools and in training colleges? 
(2) What share of primary education ought to be intrusted to women 
as teachers, head mistresses, and inspectresses? 
(3) The functions and organization of practicing schools attached to 
training colleges and similar institutions. 
In answer to these questions memoirs were sent in to the committee 
of organization from all parts of the world. Happily they were written 
by teachers and professors in actual practice and displayed that pecul- 
iar innerness which can be shown only in those subjects to which a 
man devotes his life. No science has suffered more* than pedagogy 
from the amateur, who seems to think that interest, unsupported either 
by deep study or practical experience, is a sufficient excuse for publish- 
ing his half-digested ideas. _ . 
With great skill the committee had analyzed these memoirs into a 
series of definitions and propositions, those on the question of practic. 
ing schools being the most numerous. Fuller details may be found in 
fascicule 91 of the publications of the Musée pédagogique, entitled Con- 
grés international de Venseignement primaire, Analyse des mémoires. 
Probably no country has ever had so representative a congress; in- 
deed, it would be more correct to call it a pedagogic parliament. Six 
hundred primary teachers were elected by their colleagues, not count- 
ing the delegates of the heads of the higher primary schools and train- 
ing colleges. Each canton sent up one member to form a second elect- 
ive body for the department, the member for the latter being deter- 
mined by the total number of teachers in actual work. 
A curious feature of the Paris press was the complete absence in the 
daily papers of any report or account of the debates in the congress. 
On Sunday evening, August 11, at 9, M. Falliéres gave a “lunch 
@honneur” to the delegates. Next Monday at 10 the members to the 
number of sixteen hundred assembled in the great amphitheater of the 
Sorbonne. The minister then made the following speech: 
LavIEs AND GENTLEMEN: I was unwilling to leaye to another the honor of receiv- 
ing you. You have answered our invitation. Welcome to Paris, brilliant with the 
fétes in honor of the French Revolution and the splendors of the universal exhibi-

          50 ‘ EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
tion; to Paris, where you will hear every language, where you will see every kind 
of dress, where the marvels of art, of industry, of science from all countries of 
the world will challenge your attention and your admiration. Welcome to the Sor- 
bonne, where a few days ago under the presidency of the head of the state an unfor- 
gettable ceremony inaugurated the new era of higher education. 
Your congress succeeds others that have surpassed our expectations, not only by 
the members who have taken part in them, but also by the value of their labors, 
the brilliancy of their discussions, the wealth of information given, the importance 
of the decisions arrived at, and the direction given to public opinion. Your con- 
gress in its turn will certainly be neither less brilliant nor less fruitful. I congrat- 
ulate the committee of organization on the guaranties for success which your con- 
gress shows. We recognize the hand of the eminent. man who was called some 
years ago in this very place “the first teacher in France.” 
There have been many pedagogic reunions, but yours differs in several points from 
the preceding. At the conferences of 1878 you listened but did not speak. There 
were others afterwards at which the members spoke, discussed, and voted. But one 
of them was comprised entirely of inspectors and the heads of training colleges. 
In the other only primary teachers took part. Moreover, all of them were exclu- 
sively French. : 
Then came the congress at Havre; the doors were opened to representatives of 
foreign education. But there was no rule to settle either the number or the selec- 
tion of the members. More than once during the labors of the congress the ine- 
quality of the representation was cause for regret. The experience of the past 
has not been without profit for you, and the better arrangements will be of consid- 
erable advantage to all. In this meeting all kinds and degrees of primary education, 
public or private, teaching or administrative, elementary and higher primary schools, 
from the village scheol to Fontenay and St. Cloud are represented. 
The number of delegates has been exactly proportioned to the number of schools 
represented. For the second time we are happy to see among us accredited repre- 
sentatives of pedagogy abroad. They have come from different parts of the world, 
and their presence here is an honor to us, and I have the delight of addressing to 
them the brotherly greeting of France. 
Under such conditions, who can doubt of the success of our congress? 
The very nature of the questions to be discussed is calculated to enhance the bril- 
liancy of their discussion. 
At first sight it seems as if we were in presence of three technical questions some- 
what narrow and dry. But you are under no delusion, you know what they contain; 
you soon saw that they were among the most delicate, the most living, so to speak, 
of the problems of popular education, 
As to technical education—you are going to debate the question that stands on the 
order of the day in all countries: To what ought primary education to lead? How can 
we help it to form not half-scholars or semi-bachelors, but useful workers for the 
country, men well armed for the battle of life? By what means can the school turn 
out first-class workmen, intelligent and well-instructed agriculturists, tradesmen 
trained and prudent? What form, in short, ought we to give to primary education 
to make it fruitful, practical, useful both to the individual and to the community? 
Questions enough to strongly excite men’s minds. They could not be treated by an 
assembly more competent than this. 
In the second place you will have to discuss the rdle of women in teaching and 
administration; a still more delicate and attractive question, as the solutions al- 
ready arrived at differ in the various countries. The debate can not lack interest. 
The United States, for example, throw open the whole of education, even that of 
boys and young people, at least in certain of the towns, to women; whereas in the 
countries of central and northern Europe everything is confined to men, even the 
education of girls, Finally, under the name of practising schools you have to deal 
 
-P-A-G-E-79
  EDUCATIONAL CONGRESSES AT. PARIS IN’ 1889. 51 
with the important question of a proper training of the teaching body. Neither~ 
the French nor foreigners can be indifferent to the examination of this question. 
Elsewhere as among us is not the prime difficulty to form teachers, whose common 
sense and professional qualities recommend them as much as their theoretical 
knowledge attested by a certificate? With such a programme you run no risk of 
your sittings lacking animation or interest. Besides, a valuable book has been dis- 
tributed among you, containing a large numberof articles, with exact and definite 
conclusions. These can not fail to furnish you with many useful items of informa- 
tion. 
It is time to let you proceed to your constitution in sections. One word as to the 
function of the administration with regard to the congress. The administration is 
among you, taking part in your debates, answering your questions, interested in 
your communications. But it desires the work of the congress to be yours. It 
knows your capacity, your competency. Deliberate, gentlemen, the honor and 
responsibility of your resolutions are undividedly yours. 
I declare the Congress of Primary Education to be open. 
After this speech the minister invited the leading delegates to join 
him on the platform. Mr. Clarke and Miss Smith were chosen for the 
United States. The other countries represented were England, Bel- 
gium, Holland, Switzerland, Baden, Saxony, Austria, Spain, Italy,. 
Sweden, Russia, Egypt, Mexico, Brazil, and the Argentine Republic. 
On the invitation of M. Gréard, the president, the members at once 
went to the various rooms designated for the three sections and pro- 
ceeded to elect their bureaus. 
The presidents elected were M. Salicis, since deceased, general in- 
spector of handicraft; * M. Carriot, director of primary education of 
the Seine; M. Chappuis, rector of the Academy of Dijon. 
There were ten sectional meetings and four general assemblies. 
In what form and to what extent can technical instruction (agricultural, in- 
dustrial, commercial) be given in elementary and higher primary schools, 
and in training colleges? 
The reportt was read on August 16 by M. Martel, an academy in- 
spector and delegate for the general inspection of professional schools, 
The main points were the following: ; 
Although in the preliminary analysis of memoirs a special attempt to 
define “professional teaching” had been made, the section found it im- 
possible to come to any agreement. The word “professional” was pro- 
visionally suppressed and the discussion limited to the three heads: (1) 
the teaching of agriculture, (2) commercial teaching, and (3) industrial 
teaching, each of these being considered in relation to elementary 
primary school, the higher elementary school, and the training college. 
*I venture to use this word to connote manual work from a strictly pedagogic 
point of view; sldjd is too ugly. ;

  52 - EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90, 
THE TEACHING OF AGRICULTURE, 
This branch of our subject did not occupy us for long. In primary 
education it was evidently impossible to make agriculturists in the true 
sense of the word, besides it is better to teach at school what can not be 
learned elsewhere afterwards; to children from 6 to 13 it is necessary, 
through a scientific school method, to give a taste for things agricul- 
tural, to accustom them to a habit of observation and to make them 
eapable of understanding what has been written for them in popular 
books. In the higher primary school, however, the teaching of agri- 
culture, while preserving a scientific character, might be largely de- 
veloped; a special course of agriculture would be in place there, theo- 
retical explanations being complemented by practical work, either in a 
garden or a field for experiments; the use of implements ought not to 
be made of the first importance, as daily practice or instruction in a 
special school would easily bring skill later on; in fact it was desira- 
ble and necessary to found a knowledge of agricultural facts on a sci- 
entific basis. At the training college it was enough if the pupil teacher 
were made capable of giving later on, in a proper manner, either in 
an elementary or a higher school, such instruction as we have sketched 
out above. 
The exchange of ideas Gs to the memoirs and the eiconieatnne re- 
sulted in the following resolutions, which were accepted by a large 
majority of the members present. 
I, The teaching of agriculture in the primary school, often helped by 
lessons, exercises, and above all by the museum, the garden and school 
expeditions, should be based primarily on simple experiments, as to 
the growth of vegetables. 
Ii. At the higher primary school, the special course of agriculture, 
and the demonstrations in the field for experiments, should be adapted 
to local and district needs. 
III. At the training college the pupil teachers should be made com- 
petent to teach agriculture under the conditions enunciated in the two 
preceding paragraphs. 
The general assembly accepted these i ee resolutions at once with- 
out any discussion. ‘ 
COMMERCIAL TEACHING. 
This question was the easiest our section had to deal with. Resolu- 
tions were voted within an hour, the time being taken up mainly with 
interesting accounts from the foreign delegates of the way in which 
commercial teaching has been organized abroad. 
The section agreed unanimously that commercial teaching in the 
strict sense of the word was not adapted either for the elementary school 
or the training college, Children of 12 would not understand it and 
pupils of the training college had enough subjects already. It was, how- 
ever, clear from the discussion that several members were of opinion that,
-P-A-G-E-81
  EDUCATIONAL CONGRESSES AT PARIS IN 1889. 53 
although the teacher might not find commercial teaching on his pro- 
gramme, he should not refrain from explaining to the children the 
commonest transactions, such as buying and selling, the consequences 
of signing a deed, the precautions desirable to take and the obligation 
to honestly fulfill all engagements entered into. These are matters of . 
practical morality. 
There was no desire to alter the curriculum of training colleges. 
Without introducing commercial teaching in the strict sense of the 
phrase, the present instruction in the simplest elements of common 
law, accounts, and bookkeeping will be carried on as before. 
Although commercial, teaching is not desirable in elementary pri- 
mary schools and training colleges it may be given with advantage in 
the higher primary schools. A distinction, however, may be made be- 
tween the two kinds of instruction. Calligraphy, geography, modern 
languages, the keeping of accounts, are of general use and profit to 
every man, whether he devotes himself to commerce or not, but the 
study of wares, of transport, ideas on law and commercial legislation, 
office work, are only of use to future tradesmen. We consider it, then, 
advisable to introduce the first group of subjects. in the major part of 
our higher primary schools as a restricted commercial teaching, while 
the latter group might be reserved for the great cities that possess 
important houses of commerce. We offer, then, to the approval of the 
general assembly the following three motions: 
I. Commercial teaching ought not to be introduced into the primary 
elementary school. 
Il. This teaching may be given with advantage to boys and girls in 
higher primary schools; it should be developed and made complete in 
large towns, restricted and simplified i in other places, ’ 
Ill. At the training college it will be sufficient to give the pupil 
teachers elementary notions of common law, accounts, and bookkeep- 
ing. 
The first resolution was accepted by the general assembly without 
discussion. 
At this point the minister, M, Falliéres, took his Meee on the platform 
and was heartily cheered. 
After the vote had been taken M. Caraffa, the head of the commer- 
cial school at Cordova (Argentine Republic), desired to repeat the 
remarks which he had made in the sectional meeting. He thought the 
elementary school ought to give the first rudiments of all the subjects 
that would be developed later in the higher school. 
Instead of excluding commercial teaching he should have preferred 
the formula, “commercial teaching ought to be given in every school © 
and proportioned to the age of the pupil.” The graduate of a training 
college, he thought, ought to be capable of giving instruction in any part 
of the primary school.  
-P-A-G-E-82
  54 EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
The president-was of opinion that the programmes of the elemen- 
tary school were elastic enough to include M, Caraffa’s proposal in the 
‘sense given to it by the report of the section. 
‘The other two resolutions were accepted. 
INDUSTRIAL TEACHING, 
Although we agreed, the report continued, very soon about commer- 
cial teaching, this was by no means the case with industrial teaching. 
_ A long and passionate discussion arose over this question. From the 
commencement, in the minds of a large and important group of the 
section, two questions that have undoubtedly an intimate connection, 
though it is easy to keep them apart, were confused together. On one 
side elementary handicraft, considered as a pedagogic method whose 
sole object is to give a child quickness of eye and sureness of hand, with 
the view of making concrete the teaching of design and of science, but 
without any thought of immediate application to a trade; on the other 
side, industrial teaching, which, of course presupposes handicraft and. 
also manual work made more complete and carried further and above 
all specialized so as to form the introducton to the trade to which the 
child is going to devote himself; in a word, professional hand work. 
Of these two questions the first was submitted four years ago at 
the Havre congress, and settled by resolutions assuredly not yet for- 
gotten. It hardly seemed best to submit the same proposal again after 
so short an interval. The second question was really the only one th 
section had to discuss. : 
Although the partisans of handicraft had already won their cause at 
Havre, they brought in the general question again, arousing, natu- 
rally, the old objections. Although this made our debates long and 
animated, there was compensation in the interesting communications 
given on results already obtained. 
The discussion on the real point before us was short enough and re- 
sulted in this motion: Technical industrial teaching is incompatible with 
the aims and programme of primary schools and training colleges. This 
' formula you will notice leaves a gap in our report, as it does not dis- 
tinguish, as we have done in the case of agriculture and commerce, the 
share of the three grades of our schools in industrial teaching. 
The proposer of the motion did include them at first, but suppressed 
them when it was pointed out that the section was hardly competent 
to vote as a truth of principle the suppression of industrial teaching in 
the higher primary schools. Quite recently a reproach had been made 
that the teaching was not practical enough and that it was necessary 
to transform the schools in the direction of technical instruction. 
These were the conditions under which our resolution was taken. 
We offer you no solution on the question of industrial teaching in 
higher primary schools. In this plenary sitting, if you consider the 
question opportune and there is sufficient time, you may either settle
-P-A-G-E-83
  EDUCATIONAL CONGRESSES AT PARIS IN 1889. 55 
it by a vote or perhaps preferably put it aside for further study, carried 
out more at leisure and after mature reflection. 
Immediately on the opening of the debate by the president, the pro- 
posal to add the word “elementary” came from several quarters and it 
seemed as if the protracted debates of the section would be continued. 
It was difficult to compare the procedure of other countries with that 
of France,as many do not possess a higher primary school. In Belgium 
industrial teaching was independent of primary education, and in 
France two separate administrations were concerned. At last a large 
number of members demanded the closure. This was voted and the 
resolution to.add the word “elementary” was lost. The resolution of 
the section remained intact, viz: 
I, Technical industrial teaching is oct with the aims and 
programme of primary schools and training colleges. 
What share of primary education ought to be intrusted to women as 
teachers, head mistresses, and inspectresses? 
The sectional discussions on the share of women in education had 
been heated and at times acrimonious. The ladies were considerably 
disturbed by meeting with an active opposition to their views. The 
difficulties arose over the employment of women in boys’ schools and 
of men in girls’ schools. A mixed staff does not seem to present such 
difficulties in other countries as in France. Apparently there is a de- 
cided objection to allow women to teach in a school unless they are rela- 
tives of the masters. In spite of strenuous opposition the proposal to 
limit women in mixed schools to the elementary classes was carried. 
As a makeweight it was affirmed that men teaching in a girls’ school 
should be married. In spite of all the heat displayed the section got 
‘through its programme completely. As M. Gréard, quoting Montes- 
quieu, subsequently: said, ‘il my a que la passion qui éclaire.” A jong 
report was read to the general assembly on August 14, by M. Dela- 
pierre, but the discussion ran over into the next day. The nine reso- 
lutions sent up by the section were afterwards reduced to seven. The 
first two were adopted unanimously, viz: 
I. In every infants’ class of more than 50 on the register the teacher 
“ought to be assisted by a nursemaid. 
II. The infants’ class will be attached, according to local require- 
ments, either to the maternal school or the primary school for girls. 
In the third resolution M. van Meenen proposed to substitute “ the 
lower classes” for “the classes of the elementary grade,” remarking 
that at Brussels women taught in boys’ schools up to the higher grade, 
which was reserved to men. 
M. Pizzurno, the delegate of the Argentine Republic, remarked that 
excellent results had been obtained in his country through intrusting 
women with the first and second grades. 
       
-P-A-G-E-84
    56 EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
M. Foubert, a primary inspector, asked whether the “lower classes” 
include the middle school;-if so, he should object to the amendment. 
The president remarked that it was for the administration to determine 
how far-up the school women should be ee The Congress had 
only to lay down principles. 
M. van Meenen’s amendment was carried, making the resolution run: 
III. In boys’ schools, the lower classes may be intrusted to women. 
The next resolution was voted at once: 
IY. In training colleges for women and in the higher primary schools 
for girls, certain subjects might be intrusted to men. \ 
The fifth resolution of the section on the place of women in mixed 
schools gave rise to an animated debate and many amendments. Mime. 
Kergomard, general inspectress of maternal schools, made several 
observations on the resolutions of the second section taken as a whole. 
She spoke for the minority, which she claimed included the majority of 
the women present. She resented the imputation of physical weak- 
ness, the inability to make journeys or inquiries. Women were as 
capable as men of imbuing the youthful mind with republican ideas; 
indeed, the chief hindrance to their diffusion had been the want of 
their acceptance by all women; every village and hamlet needed a 
republican woman teacher. The law had just made women fellow- 
workers with men, and it was too late to retrograde. 
MM. Caire, primary inspector at La Mure (Isére), wished the law of 
October 30, 1886, which allows a mixed school to be intrusted to men 
or women, to be maintained, with the proviso of restricting small coun- 
try schools of less than thirty children to women alone. Although 
Mme. Kergomard’s contention may be just politically, a woman could 
hardly act in the administrative capacity of secretary to the mayor. 
The section, perhaps wisely, from a pedagogic point of view, had shown » 
_ itself more timid than the senate. 
M. van Meenen considered women as physically strong enough for 
any school work, and thought the role of women should be increased 
‘in boys’ schools; if a woman was capable of being the head of a train- . 
ing college, was*she not capable of inspection? The secretaryship to 
the mayor and the large number of children in the class were special 
eases, which could be safely left to the local administrative powers. 
Mr. Lyulph Stanley, a member of the London school board, thought 
the question of men or women teachers of secondary importance to the 
education of the children. If mixed schools were desirable, women must 
take a large share of the work in them; for his part he considered an edu- 
cation in common, good both for boys and girls. The experience of the 
London school board in permitting pupil teachers of both sexes to fol- 
low certain courses of study together had not been attended by the 
slightest- inconvenience. The civil law in France was very hard on 
women, and the same sort of treatment was liable to be carried into the 
school; he considered the motion and its precautions unjust to women. 
 
-P-A-G-E-85
  ; ‘ 
EDUCATIONAL CONGRESSES AT PARIS IN 1889. Oe 
Several more speeches were made and several amendments proposed; 
at last the closure was voted, and the president asked the assembly to 
vote on the three different systems: 
(1) The system of the second section, maintaining that in theory 
mixed schools should be intrusted to men, except in certain exceptional 
cases. 
(2) The opposite system, which would intrust them to women only, 
and, finally, the third form, which was adopted as the resolution, viz: 
‘V. Mixed schools may be intrusted to men or women, according to 
need. 
The fifth and sixth motions of the section were -put aside by the 
president, as they related to France only, and were not of international 
value. They had reference to the share of the sewing mistress in 
teaching the lower classes in other subjects and to freeing the head: 
mistress of a school of not less than five classes from class work. 
The discussion on the next motion, the share of women in inspec- 
tion, proved as ardent as the previous discussions had been. 
Mlle. Scordia, of Paris, supported the demand of the minority in the 
section, claiming a share for women in the work of inspection. This 
claim ought not to be taken as a hostile act directed by women against 
primary inspectors. Even admitting the objections made, they were 
not absolutely exclusive. Let at least a trial be made under favorable _ 
circumstances, and she hoped that inspection by a woman would be 
made welcome in girls’ schools. 
M. Gavard, the head of the department of public instruction at 
Geneva, said that the question had been settled in Switzerland. In- 
spection by women had been accepted by the family as well as the 
state; it was unwise to put a veto on the discretion of the administra- 
tive powers. 
M. Delapierre thought the different conditions in other countries 
made a comparison with France delusive. If inspection of girls’ 
schools were intrusted to women only, boys would receive an education 
republican and patriotic, but neutral as far as religious dogmas were 
edneerned, while that of girls would be probably something quite dif- 
ferent. To weaken the patriotic idea in a number of their schools 
would be a blunder. 
M. Houzeaude Lahaie, member of the Chamber of eprosentalives of 
Belgium, desired to leave the higher offices of teaching open to women, 
In Belgium women had shown, under trying circumstances, the same 
devotion, moral force, and capacity as men. He hoped the assembly 
would not let it be possible for the adversaries of liberal ideas to affirm 
that liberal ideas had been condemned at Paris. 
A proposal to apply the closure was rejected. 
M. Plazy, primary inspector at Angouléme, approved the restriction 
of women to education and instruction; on the administrative side they 
would not be able to bear the brunt of party struggles to which the 
primary inspector was very liable.

58 EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
The inspector brought to his task more energy, connectedness, and 
calmness. The cases really needing the aid of a woman were rare and. 
might be left to the tact and moderation of the inspector. 
Mile. Hourtefeu, the head of the training college of Tarbes, spoke 
with reluctance, but as her defection had been specially mentioned she 
was compelled to justify herself. Women were not fit to act as inspect- 
ors; how could they lodge at any chance wayside inn, or suffer the 
other inconveniences of traveling in remote districts. The inspector 
was as capable of protecting a woman teacher as any other woman 
would be; besides the professional contact of men and women was of 
advantage to both. 
The closure was again demanded and passed, after the president had 
read a long list of amendments; three propositions were before the 
assembly. 2 
' (1) The motion of the section to place the inspection of girls’ schools 
entirely in the hands of men. 
(2) The motion, chiefly supported by the foreign delegates, to intrust 
inspection to men and women. 
(3) The motion to employ women, by way of trial, for inspection in 
favorable places. The second was rejected and the third adopted under 
the form of— 
VI. By way of trial, eiployzend may be made of women in the work 
of inspection. 
The last resolution was accepted in the form— 
VII. It is desirable to maintain the ordinary and the general inspec- 
tion of maternal schools by women. 
The contrast between the more liberal views of the — Govern- 
ment-and the foreign delegates as compared with those of the men 
teachers in France was very striking. 
The functions and organization of practicing schools attached to training 
colleges and similar institutions. 
Before proceeding to the discussions on training colleges we may in- 
tercalate a few remarks on their history: 
In each stage of the strenuous development of education since 1879 
the first step in France has been always to provide trained teachers, 
and to start from the broad base of the primary system. In England 
when any public or quasi-public body like the Society of Arts, the City 
Guilds, the Chamber of Commerce, or agovernment department, arranges 
for a new branch of education, the invariable plan is to examine the 
pupils and to “ pay by results;” even to invite a teacher on the organ- 
izing committee while the plan is under consideration, is extremely 
rare. 
The phrase école normale first occurs in a report presented for the com- 
- mittee of public instruction by Lakanal to the convention on October
-P-A-G-E-87
  EDUCATIONAL CONGRESSES AT PARIS IN 1889. 59 
30, 1794; there ought to be founded at Paris, says the first article, a 
normal school to receive citizens already acquainted with the useful 
sciences, that they may learn from the most capable professors the art 
of teaching. Although on January 20, 1795, 1,400 htarers came from 
all parts of France to the inauguration, the school was closed on the 
following 15th of May. Much was done during the first half of this 
century, but the realization of the proud scheme of the convention, not 
alone for Paris but also for the whole of France, was reserved for the 
pregnant ministry of Jules Ferry (February 4, 1879, to November 4, 
1881). 
On August 9,1879, all the departments were commanded by law to 
found normal colleges for women; four years were given in which to 
fulfill the legal conditions, but-at the present moment eight depart- 
ments are still unprovided for. At the end of the last year France 
possessed 171 normal colleges, 89 for men and 82 for women; 29,919 
pupils in all have been admitted; the budget of 5,627,702 franes in 1878 
rising to 8,997,404 in 1888. 
With the loyal codperation of the various local powers, the ministry 
has striven with success to infuse into these normal schools a new 
spirit in harmony with modern ideas; to loosen the ties binding thenr 
to an obsolete past, and by improving the organization and discipline, 
to fill the pupil teachers with an adequate sense of the importance of 
their calling. 2 
As a kind of nervus nervorum for these provincial training colleges, 
to train teachers for the training of teachers, two remarkable institu- 
tions, called Ecoles Normales Supérieures @ Enseignement Primaire, have 
been founded at St. Cloud and Fontenay, the former in 1882 for men, 
and the latter in 1880 for women. : . 
The third section of the congress was the first to hand in its report. 
It was in consequence taken first in point of time by the general as- 
sembly. 
In opening the debates the president desired that they should be 
absolutely sincere; within the limits of the questions laid before the 
assembly any, opinion might be freely expressed. The resolutions 
would then, if they were not unanimous, represent the real opinions of 
the majority. 
This, we may add, represented the wish of the administrative powers. 
Indeed, such large meetings of teachers are generously meant by the 
Government to act as a check on the natural tendency of power to fall 
too exclusively into their own hands. A state department must of 
necessity work by definite rules, but overregulation is highly danger- 
ous to education. 
‘The report of the third section was read by M. Quénardel, director 
of the training college at Amiens. 
The warmth with which several speakers expressed their opinions, 
the care they took to point out that their sole object was the progress 
   
-P-A-G-E-88
    60 ; EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
of primary education, prove the importance attached to the question 
we had to study. The need of a practicing school was affirmed by a 
very large majority. 
Our foreign members helped us largely by an account of the pro- 
cedure in their countries to arrive at the conclusion that the practicing . 
school ought to be an integral part of the training college. 
The organization of this school was a matter of long debate. Some 
desired that the pupil teacher should be taught to grapple with general 
questions in teaching, while others thought that, if he could be shown 
how to give lessons properly in that grade in which he would probably 
spend his time as a probationer, the school would have'fulfilled its réle. 
If the pupil teachers were initiated in the direction of a school with a 
single master—the commonest type in the country—so much the better. 
Probably it was excessive to expect so much. Our resolution took the 
form: The practicing school will be of the same type as the majority of 
the schools in the district. It will be a school with a single master and 
three grades. Who ought to be the head master of. the practicing 
school? This again roused an animated debate, the differences being on 
‘matters of form rather than principle. A large number desired the ad- 
ministration to select some one among the primary teachers who had 
been engaged in actual work for some time; others considered the teach- 
ers in a training college more fitted from the attention they had paid to 
pedagogy and psychology. But the section, preferring practical expe- 
rience, thought it desirable to make the post of head master an object 
of ambition to those teachers who had seen at least five years of sery- 
ice in an elementary primary school. 
How much time ought the pupil teachers to give to their general 
education and how much to strictly professional training? ‘Leave 
things as they are,” said some. ‘“ Devote the first two years to educa- 
tion and the third to training,” said others. Since the elementary 
certificate is demanded of pupils at their entrance and since the curric- 
ulum of the training college has enough subjects already, we have 
agreed to recommend that the higher certificate should be taken at 
the end of the first term in the third year, thus leaving the last four 
months for the practical training. To insure the pedagogic value of 
the practicing school we think the marks attained in it by the pupil 
teachers ought to be of weight in their first appointments on leaving the 
training college. 
The General Assembly accepted at once the first 1esolution unani- 
mously: 
I. A practicing school is indispensable for the professional education. 
of the pupils of a training college. 
The second resolution sent up by the section was this: 
II. The practicing school will be attached to the training college. 
One. director, on the plea that these schools had not fulfilled expecta- 
tious, proposed to grant the minister, in conjunction with the depart--

mental council, the power to close a practicing school; this was deci- 
sively rejected. 
The discussion then began to trench on the third resolution as to the 
type of the school and led to some contradictory voting. After several 
amendments had been rejected the general assembly accepted by a 
large majority the wording of the section as above. 
The form of the third sectional resolution was: The practicing school 
ought to be of the same type as the majority of the schools of the dis- 
trict, a school with a single master and three grades. This was 
amended by M. Lenient, and accepted after another long discussion by 
the general assembly as follows: ; : 
IIL. The practicing school ought to be of the same type as the ma- 
jority of the primary schools to which the students will be sent on their 
leaving the traming college. 
The appointment of the head master was warmly, not to say Aen cely, 
debated. Inspectors and teachers were manifestly on opposite sides. 
The bone of contention was the class of teachers from which he was to 
be taken and the time of service before he could become eligible. Teri 
amendments were sent in; the majority, coming from the teachers, 
tended to exclude the professors ina training college. M, Jacoulet, a 
general inspector and the head of the well-known college at Saint Cloud, 
protested against the injustice of keeping out the very élite of their 
profession; the training college was as much an integral part of primary 
education as the school. The final form of the resolution was: 
IV. The head master of the practicing school should*be chosen from 
among those members of public primary instruction who have served 
for five years at least and have shown pedagogic aptitude. 
The fifth sectional resolution, containing three paragraphs, dealing 
with the time to be allotted to general education and to technical train- 
ing was rejected piecemeal by the general assembly. 
As M. Lenient pointed out, the students would hardly pay any serious 
attention to work lying outside of their preparation for the higher cer- 
tificate. Since, too, the latest official programme dated only from Jan- 
uary 10, 1889, it was too early to talk of lightening it. After the re- 
jection of another string 6f amendments, the assembly refused to settle 
any date for the examination and contented itself with formulating as 
a final resolution: 
~ V. In classifying the pupil teachers on their leaving, a special state- 
ment should be made of the marks obtained in the practicing school.   
M. Gréard’s Report to the Minister of Education.—The final general 
assembly took place on August 16, under the presidency of the minister. 
An account of the Congress was submitted to him by M. Gréard and 
ran as follows: : 
Our labors are now over. Since you opened the Congress we have met either in 
section or general assembly once and sometimes twice a day. You were desirous 
that our discussions as far as concerned the questions submitted to us should be 
 
-P-A-G-E-90
        62. EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
free and sincere. I think I can assure you that every variety of opinion has been 
able to find expression and that in the resolutions we have arrived at the exact 
expression of the opinions of the whole Congress or at least of an indisputable ma- 
" jority of its members. Our first question was on the professional teaching of agri- 
culture, commerce, and industry. At first we tried to define the phrase “profes- 
sional teaching;” we had to give up the attempt. A definition can hardly be made 
among two thousand persons. The commission at the Académie Frangaise charged 
with the study of the dictionary consists of only three members, and they do not al- 
waysagree at first. The place, however, of professional teaching in primary educa- 
tion was clear enough. Obviously it is neither apprenticeship schools, with their 
own methods and establishments, nor technical teaching, which necessarily connotes 
a special and direct application to trade, to industry, and to commerce. In primary 
teaching, the aim of which is a general education of the faculties of the child, pro- 
fessional teaching can only be a remote preparation for the exercise of an occupation, 
a foretaste, a bait, a means of showing the child the application of the general prin- 
ciples he has learned, the profit he can win from them, and the credit attaching to 
them. The resolutions of the Congress have been drawn up from this point of view. 
It is of opinion that professional training properly so called—naturally I except han- 
dicraft, which is nothing but a gymnastic of the hand and eye—ought not to be 
introduced into the primary school. : 
It is of opinion that agricultural instruction may be given both in the elementary 
andin the higher primary school; in the former by a suitable choice of readers and 
lessons; in the latter in the form of an experimental course; in both of course with 
a proper regard to the age and conditions under which the children have to work 
and to the actual needs of the district. It is also of opinion that, although commer- 
cial education ought only to be treated in the elementary primary school as a com- 
plement to the rudiments of the first stage in education, it might with advantage be 
developed in the higher primary school, taking due account of the relative impor- 
tance and varying wants of local necessities. In the training colleges the pupil 
teachers may, we think with advantage, be initiated into the elements of agricul- 
‘tural and commercial instruction so far as may be necessary for the establish- 
ments to which they will afterwards be sent. The question of industrial teaching 
was not examined so completely; one thing, however, was clear, a belief that, except 
for what are called in France the higher primary schools, the introduction of indus- 
trial teaching was incompatible with the programme of the elementary schools as 
wellas with that of training colleges. All these problems are intimately bound up 
with social questions; they are not pedagogic pure and simple; it is to the credit 
of the congress that they have been treated with a just sense of the actual condition 
of affairs. 
The question of “practicing schools” is not a new one, and I can hardly say that 
it has been definitely treated. The difficulties of organization are the same to-day as 
yesterday. The debate, however, has brought into light the principles for a possible 
solution of the question. Weagreedas to the need of a practicing school; tothenced 
of attaching it to the training college; to the choice of the masters—primary teachers 
or professors of the training college—to whom the direction ought to be confided. 
From both we demand at least five years of actual experience and a well-recognized 
pedagogic ability. We were agreed, too, on the necessity of recognizing, indepen- 
dently of the other examinations, the professional work done in the practicing 
school. 
These conclusions, however, were not arrived at without debate. Indeed it some- 
times happened that the resolutions of the section, although carried after consid- 
‘erable discussion, were completely modified in the general assembly. But these 
changes of opinion served only to bring into relief tho fundamental points of the 
controversy. Whether the practicing sclrool be made independent of the training 
college or not, whether the teaching be modeled on one type—the school with a
-P-A-G-E-91
  ‘ EDUCATIONAL CONGRESSES AT PARIS IN 1889.” 63 
single master and three grades—or whether the organization be varied with the dis- 
trict, the one important point recognized was this, that it was the duty of the train- 
ing college not to train for an examination, but to make future “educators, men, 
that is to say, capable of bringing their knowledge under discipline, of adapting a 
lesson for a class, of teaching the same subject in a different way according to the 
age, the knowledge, and the ability of their small audience; capable, above all, of 
watching a child’s character, of keeping his good and bad sides distinct, of teaching 
him to get control over his inclinations, of habituating him to enter into the posses- 
sion of himself; in short of bringing to bear upon his mind and his character a genu- 
ine influence, Such is the real object of the apprenticeship in the practicing school. 
Happy are we if we can devote time enough to this professional training! 
Ym mentioning the place of women in education you haye, sir, pointed out how 
France stands midway between those countries, such as America, where all educa- 
tional functions are open to them and those where everything is closed. Indeed, the 
French law gives women an exclusive right to some posts, such, for instance, as the 
direction of maternal schools, which I remember I have seen, less than twenty years 
ago, inthe handsofmen. There is an inclination to admit women to the like rights 
for mixed schools, nor is the power to enjoy the highest functions of inspection of all 
kinds refused; if the barriers have not been removed, they have at least been low- 
ered. Imust, however, as a faithful reporter, confess that the congress has not been 
so liberal as the law. It was only after a prolonged struggle that the right to share 
in the direction of mixed schools was admitted; except in the case of maternal 
schools, the congress was of opinion that the cares and fatigues of inspection should 
be spared women as much for their sake as for that of the public. I am not aware 
if these reasons have convinced those interested. Some of them disdained any am- 
bition for delicate and lofty reasons. On the whole, they were jealous of the 
authority whieh the congress was not inclined to grant them. For my part I should 
take the side of the minority. AsI have ventured to state my opinion, permit me to 
justify it. The sole ppint to make me pause in making men and women inspectors 
would be the dual powers and the possibility of a conflict in the management of 
schools; conflicts are always undesirable, more especially when authority needs to — 
be exercised with sequence and harmony. As to the capacity of women for wield- _ 
ing control,I have more confidence than they have themselves in their quickened 
sympathy, their gentle and firm reason, their habits of self-denial. Education and 
all connected with it demand self-sacrifice. And where can we find this self-sac- 
rifice more complete than in women? Feminine pedagogy as a whole is founded on 
this principle or sentiment. I donot intend to claim this virtue specially for the 
French school. The woman who gives herself up to others belongs to every 
country. 
You see, sir, the three questions have been discussed, as they deserve to be, with 
interest and animation and, I may add, at times with passion. We do not complain. 
It was Montesquieu who said: “‘Passion alone illuminates,” 
We owe much to our foreign delegates. We feel touched and honored by their 
presence. They have helped to give an elevated turn to our discussions. We have 
been fortunate in listening to M. Lyulph Stanley, one of the most eminent members 
of the London school board; M. Gavard, head of the department of public education 
in the canton of Geneva; M. van Meenen and M. Houzeau de Lahaie, of Belgium; 
Miss Beale, the head of Cheltenham Ladies’ College; M. Pizzurno, the delegate of 
the Argentine Republic; and many others who have lent us the aid of their expe- 
rience and authority. Iam sure that I carry the feelings of the congress with me in - 
thanking them for their presence. > 
The foreign members returned thanks in speeches that were warmly 
applauded. 
The minister then invited the three sectional reporters, MM. Martel, 
       
-P-A-G-E-92
  64 EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. j 
Delapierre, and Quenardel, to read the final resolutions. In closing 
the congress the ministey gracefully thanked the foreign representa- 
‘tives, together with M. Gréard and M. Buisson. Ministers change, 
he continued, but thanks to the perseverance and the genius of the 
men who remained, the great movement of education had been made 
possible and carried out. As M. Stanley had said, it seemed for- 
merly as if the three degrees of education had nothing to do with 
one another, each following its own aim in its own way. But to-day 
they formed a trinity whose unity was recognized. - 
The Republic had the honor of bringing primary instruction into this 
fruitful and vivifying union. By a lucky coincidence the centenary of 
the French Revolution has seen the realization by law of one of the 
highest inspirations of the revolution: primary instruction given by 
the state and become the leading public service. From the debates he 
hoped to get, in the phrase of Rabelais, “the substantific marrow.” 
However much was done in primary education there was still always 
something to do. The legislators made the laws, but the teachers had 
to apply them; it was for them to show that, in the new and delicate 
parts of these laws still new to many, the government of the republic 
had worked for peace no less than for emancipation. The women teach- 
ers had nothing in common with the blue stockings, turned into ridi- 
cule by Moliére; in girls’ schools they had a no less important task 
than the men in boys’ schools; the democracy needed women, educated, 
strong, and virtuous. Both men and women were conscious of their 
duty; they had to form men for France and citizens for the Republic. 
An anonymous donor had given 900 francs to be shared among the 
writers of the best memoirs sent into the congress. In all ranks of 
society there are men who do good silently. Democracy, in spite of its 
adversaries, is not nade to abase, but to elevate. 
Suction IV.—TuHE CONGRESS ON SECONDARY AND HicuHER Epv- 
CATION, 
Although not honored with the presence of the minister nor attended 
by so many members, the proceedings in the secondary congress lacked 
neither animation nor importance, Indeed, when over it seemed all too 
short. 
There were 422 members, of whom 121 were foreigners, and of these 
12 were Americans. The English head masters were conspicuous by 
their absence. The attendance at the general assemblies varied from 
60 to 80; a striking contrast to the primary congress. 
At the first general assembly, on August 6, under the presidency of 
M. Gréard, the bureau of the committee of management was confirmed 
and nineteen visitors were invited to join it, among them being Mr. 
Clarke and Dr. Harris. 
The vice-presidents were MM. Bréal, De Lapparent, and Morel; the 
general secretaries were MM. Dreyfus-Brisac and Perrier,
-P-A-G-E-93
  
  EDUCATIONAL CONGRESSES AT PARIS IN 1889. 65 
Agreeably to the regulations the general assembly split up into two 
sections. M. Bufnoir was elected president for the section on higher 
and M. Morel for the one en secondary education. 
As we have already mentioned, the five questions settled on before- 
hand had been treated by various hands and their articles published 
by the minister of commerce, industry, and the colonies. They were: 
1, Extent and sanction of secondary studies (matriculation, leaving certificates). 
M. H. Pigeonneau. 
2. The international equivalence of studies and degrees. MM. Bufnoir and Th. 
Cart. 
3. The various types of secondary education; what relative weight ought to be 
ascribed to the classics, to modern languages, and to science. M. A. 
Croiset. 
4, By what methods ought secondary instruction in modern languages and sci- 
ence to be given to girls? MM. Bossert, Darboux, E. Perrier. © 
. On the place of economic and social sciencein higher education. M.E. Boutmy. o 
Extent and sanction of secondary studies. 
The first question was both international and specifically French. 
It may not perhaps be superfluous to state that a bachelor in France 
stands at the beginning of his university career, in England at the end. 
The article of M. H. Pigeonneau, after mentioning the official inquiry of 
1885 and the report of M. Gréard,* finds three essential points in the 
question proposed: (1) Is a sanction for secondary studies advan- 
tageous? (2) What are the advantages and disadvantages of the- 
various systems at present in vogue? - 
Simply to abolish the baccalaureate would lead to chaos in the schools 
and the intellectual disorganization of the country; besides, Belgium 
tried the experiment in 1854 and 1876, the baccalaureate was postponed 
to the end of the first year at the university, but made the final school 
examination again in 1861 and 1888, ~ 
There are four principal ways in which a certificate can be given at 
the end of the school career: (1) With or without a special examination 
by the members of the establishment in which the child had been 
educated, without the intervention of any outside body. (2) A uni- 
versity examination before professors or a special body of examiners 
and simply conferring the right to matriculate. (3) An examination in 
the school by the teachers, but before representatives of the state, who 
have the power to confer certain rights, such as entrance to the uni- 
versity. (4) An examination outside the school by the State, on a pro- 
gramme more or less like the one used in the school. 
After characterizing shortly the type of examination in England, 
America, Prussia, Austria, Holland, Belgium, Denmark, and Norway, 
M. Pigeonneau considers the German the most satisfactory. ‘The pupil’s 
school life is taken into account; he does not feel out of his element 
(il ne le dépayse pas), as the examination takes place in his own school, 
  
* Revue Internationale, September, 1886, 
5 ED 90.   
   
-P-A-G-E-94
      66 EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
before his own masters, and without any special preparation outside of 
the regular currieulum. The written examination preponderating over 
the oral makes it possible to test method, composition, and style, things 
that can not be crammed and that best prove a general education, the 
special aim of a secondary school. Incapacity can present itself net 
more than three times. The presence of a state official sustains the 
level and dignity of the examination. 
The most reasonable of the numberless objections urged against the 
baccalauréat are that as it opens the road to the professions and pub- 
lie life it has become not the sanction but the end of secondary educa- 
tion. Subjects not on its programme are quite neglected; the candi- 
date and the examiners are strangers, while the element of chance is 
too great. The university professors are burdened with the correction 
of papers and the permission to try indefinitely makes the baccalaureate 
a certificate of obstinacy. 
The labors of the section on this question were brought before the 
general assembly on August 10 by M. Max Egger. We give a résumé 
of his report: 
The section at once adopted M: Pigeonneam’s first conclusion: Jt is 
necessary for secondary studies to have a sanction. i 
Several interesting details on the manner of applying the tests of 
efficiency were given by the foreign members. In Switzerland, for ex- 
ample, in every examination for passing from one stage te another the 
average of the marks obtained during the year count one-half. This 
plan was only possible in some special schools in France, such as the 
polytechnic, central, naval, ete. Insistence was laid on the fact that 
the baccalauréat was not a competitive but a pass examination, and that 
the future life of a candidate depended on his success in it. It ought, 
therefore, to be obtainable by every candidate of fair intelligence who 
had worked for it conscientiously. According to M. Rabier, the pre- 
cautions taken to render any injustice impossible were inadequate, 
being less than those for any small legalease. In consequence of these 
remarks M. Pigeonneau added a supplementary resolution to his second 
conclusion, the two running thus: 
The best form of sanction is that which permits the conscientious 
and average pupil to obtain the final diploma without any special prep- 
aration or strained efforts, but simply by following the regular course 
of studies. 
Whatever plan of sanction be adopted, it is desirable for the acquire- 
ment of the diploma at the end of his studies that account be taken of 
the prior marks obtained and of the class of the pupil in the establish- 
ment where he has carried on his studies. 
This again brought into light the various applications possible in — 
countries that varied in their political and social conditions; each coun- 
try must determine for itself what weight the body of examiners ought 
to give to the pupil’s former training.
-P-A-G-E-95
  ‘ 
EDUCATIONAL CONGRESSES AT PARIS IN 1889, 67 
M. Blanchet wished to define the proper method more exactly by 
proposing the plan of examining the candidates by their own teachers 
in the presence of representatives of the state. But this was held to 
trench on politics and to be therefore out of place in a pedagogie gath- 
ering. From an ideal point of view, as M. Dreyfus-Brisac showed, 
the plan was excellent, but in France, for example, the legislator would 
be met by varied and numerous difficulties—the inequality of studies 
in state and private establishments; the difficulty of procuring teach- 
ers with sufficient authority. In cases where several different interests 
were concerned, recriminations would be sure to arise when students 
failed to pass their examinations. The state delegate would be the 
scapegoat for all sorts of complaints. 
In the case of private establishments the students would have to ap- 
pear before a state jury, in which they would not find their own masters, 
or the latter would be given the important power of conferring an offi- 
cial certificate. Again, private establishments would then have to be 
divided into two classes, those that were and those that were not 
worthy to conduct the exatnination. 
In fact, it was not desirable to go further than M. Pigeonneaw’s reso- 
lution, embodying, as it did implicitly, M. Blanchet’s proposal—the 
best way to learn of a student’s industry and capacities was to hear the 
opinion of the masters he had been under. 
A third motion due to MM. Herzen and Pigeonneau was also ac- 
cepted by the section: The three sanctions for the three types of secondary 
education give admission to the corresponding types of higher education, 
Attempts to further define the mode of application of the various sane- 
tions were not accepted as they were not international, and examina- 
tions were already sufficiently complicated. The General Assembly 
practically adopted the report. The first two resolutions were: 
I. Itis necessary for secondary studies to have a sanction. 
Il. The best form of sanction is that which permits the conscientions 
and average pupil to obtain the final diploma without any special 
preparation or strained efforts, but simply by following the regular 
course of studies. 
The third resolution seemed too absolute to the rector of Montpellier, 
as the variety of secondary establishments was so great; at the sug- 
gestion of M. Chappuis it was amended into: 
ILI. Whatever plan of sanction be adopted it would be desirable for 
the acquirement of the diploma at the end of his studies that account 
be taken of the prior marks obtained and of the class of the pupil in 
the establishment where he had carried on his studies. M. Blanchet 
proposed that: The candidates be examined before a jury composed of 
the masters and a delegate of the state. 
M. Chappuis resumed the discussion in the section and moved the 
rejection of the motion. M. Lichtenberger, however, thought the plan 
desirable from a purely pedagogie point of view, ind that the conflict- 
    sh SaaS 
   
-P-A-G-E-96
  68 EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
_ ing claims of the state and the particular establishment might be rec- 
onciled. | \ 
The staffs, according to M. Morel, varied so much in value that the 
jury within the establishment was impossible. 
Dr. Lagneau thought it desirable to have several partial examina- 
tions to settle the marks given. 
M. Pigeonneau thought it undesirable to specify the details, and on 
the proposal of the president the Congress passed on without taking a 
vote. 
The next resolution of the section was accepted: 
IV. The three sanctions for the three types of secondary education 
give admission to the corresponding types of higher education. 
M. Herzen wished the careers, to which these sanctions would lead, 
to be specified. This, M. Urechia pointed out, was trespassing on the 
domain of higher education. “In that case,” replied M. Herzen, “we 
are making three keys, of which one will open’ the doors of all the 
faculties and the other two will shut them.” “Then we must make 
special locks,” replied the president. 
The international equivalence of studies and degrees. 
. For the truly international question of the equivalence of degrees, 
there were two articles due to the pens of M. Bufnoir and M. Cart. 
Although, says M. Bufnoir, books and the press spread rapidly the 
discoveries and researches of scholars, the living voice of a professor 
and the intellectual atmosphere of a university form the most powerful 
stimulus for a young student. How far can we accept foreign tests as 
granting admission to try for a higher degree? To students who simply 
desired to listen the lecture rooms of France have always been open, 
but an official sanction can not be obtained unless the monetary regu- 
lations, as fixed by the decree of April 22, 1854, are complied with. 
In, the old French faculty of law at Strasburg strangers could obtain 
an official recognition of their studies and examinations, shared with 
the French, provided they did not claim the right to practice in France. 
Such a permission extended to medicine would be certain to attract 
many foreigners. The case of a student at one university who wishes 
to carry on his studies abroad without a breach in their continuity adds 
_ another difficulty to that of money. 
‘The points about which the labors of the congress must turn are thus 
formulated : 
(1) To state exactly the regulations of different countries limiting 
admission to higher education. 
(2) To examine if it be useful and possible to make any modifications 
with a view to an international rule. This would lead to three ques- 
tions for debate: 
(a) Isit desirable and possible to establish an international equiva-

to higher instruction be granted to a foreign student simply on his show. 
ing that he possessed the necessary qualifications for admittanee in his 
native country? 
(b) Is it desirable to recommend as a useful international practice 
the concession of the power to keep terms at a foreign university? 
(ec) Is it desirable and practicable to establish an international equiv- 
alence of degrees either from the scientific point of view for obtaining 
a higher degree or from the professional point of view. 
M. Cart’s memoir studies the question as far as it affects degrees in 
arts. In 1877-78 the Paris faculty of letters had 6 students; in 
1887~88, 1,200. This remarkable rise is ascribed to the “ cours fermés” 
as a supplement to the public lectures of the professors. , 
A foreign student would, of course, wish to join this private course, 
when the real, serious work is done and the personal influence of the 
professor comes into play. Admission, granted so as not to destroy 
the homogeneity of the class, must carry with it the right to proceed 
to the final examination. A comparative table is given of the subjects 
demanded by the different countries for the examination corresponding 
to the Baccalauréat-ds-lettres and another for the Licence-ds-lettres in 
France and French Switzerland. To draw up these tables must have 
been a delicate and difficult task; indeed, we can hardly expect one 
man to do it without putting widely different things together. A Lon- 
don master of arts would not care to consider his examination no 
harder than that of moderations at Oxford. Again, the Cambridge 
bachelor of arts may mean with a high wrangler the display of ability 
capable of taking any degree in Europe or the modest intellectual 
equipment of a pollman, who probably “ gets through” on less than a 
French bachelier. The pollman and the wrangler can both become . 
masters of arts—by the payment of a sum of money. The original 
office of universities, viz, to supply teachers shimmers through this 
arrangement. The bachelor had proved his knowledge; after three 
years’ probation and exercise he was fit to begin the practice of the art . 
of teaching, for which naturally an examination at that time was im- 
possible. The need for a full preliminary digest of the regulations 
actually in force at present was shown at the first meeting of the sec- 
tion on August 7, when the whole of the morning sitting under the 
presidency of M. Bufnoir was taken up by statements from the differ- 
ent delegates of the procedure in Belgium, Italy, Switzerland, Mexico, 
Austria, Greece, England, Egypt, Holland, Roumania, and Spain. 
After some interesting discussions, the section determined to send up 
to the general assembly as affirmations the three questions (a), (0), (¢), 
as above, with the important elimination from (c) of “the professional 
point of view.” 
The report of the section was presented on August 9 to the general 
assembly by M. Th. Cart. 
 
-P-A-G-E-98
    10 EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
From our foreign members we have learned that almost all of their 
universities demand, on the student's entrance, some certificate of 
serious secondary studies. All of them allow strangers to enter the 
various faculties without the payment of fees, provided they can show a 
diploma analogous to the one necessary for the native student. Some- 
times the permission to attend lectures is granted by the faculty con- 
cerned, but more generally a decision made once for all. by the higher 
authorities confers real privileges on the possessor of a foreign diploma. 
. Under certain restrictions the majority of the different universities per- 
mit a student to keep some of his terms at another university. 
From a professional point of view some of the faculties, such as law 
and medicine, require a supplementary examination of a special char- 
acter. A medical student, for example, must diagnose a patient, per- 
form a chirurgical operation, or answer questions on pathology. 
Although our first meeting was one of exposition rather than diseus- 
- sion, a unanimous desire to make the entrance to various universities as 
easy for the student as possible was made plainly manifest. The ques- 
- tion naturally became more complicated when an attempt was made to 
define the necessary restrictions for admission, and the right authority 
to grant it, and to settle the proper equivalence between a foreign and 
a native diploma. 
Some were of opinion that the metnod actually in vogue in France 
was liberal enough; that the government only in conjunction with the 
faculty concerned ought to grant the equivalence. This would insure 
an adequate preliminary training and aid the government in case it 
seemed desirable to refuse the equivalence. ‘Others considered that 
this would lead to an arbitrary exercise of power; that a favor and 
not a right would be conferred. The foreigner, not being quite certain 
of obtaining the favor, would be shy of visiting a foreign university. 
With regard to admission to the various faculties, it seemed desirable 
to fix the value of a foreign diploma once for all, and thus the right of 
entry would be guaranteed to the foreign student. 
A. special commission would examine the various foreign sanctions 
for secondary education and settle definitely their relative value to the 
home sanction. This equivalence would-of course hold only so long as 
the foreign sanction remained unchanged. Others, again, wished to 
make admission still more easy. They proposed to ask from the foreign 
student only such a sanction as he would have to show in his own coun- 
try in order to proceed to a higher study of the same kind. This solu- 
tion was hardly possible except on the condition that the foreigner, 
having obtained his degrees elsewhere, should practice only in his own 
country. Indeed, as the demands made abroad might be less at the 
commencement the native student would be unfairly treated. 
Besides, it was remarked that, as the diploma would be of value only 
jn another country, its value there would not be rated high. 
There were, then, four opinions: 
 
-P-A-G-E-99
  EDUCATIONAL CONGRESSES AT PARIS IN 1889. - UW 
(1) The examination of each particular case by the faculty con. 
cerned. 
(2) An examination by a special commission to settle definitely on 
the equivalence of foreign diplomas. 
(3) Admission of foreign students to the faculties simply on the pro- > 
duction of the analogous sanction demanded in their own country, 
with the reserve that the diplomas granted would be recognized only 
in that country. 
(4) The unreserved admission of such students as the ones actinaale f 
above. 
The discussion seemed in danger of never coming to an end. On the 
motion of M. Gavard, details were left on one side, and M. Bufnoir’s 
rédaction was accepted with a slight modification: It is desirable to 
establish the international equivalence of diplomas or certificates giving 
the right to pass from secondary to higher education in its various forms. 
The proposal of M. Casanova, of Madrid, to appoint an international 
commission.to find the best way of settling equivalence by obtaining 
uniformity in studies was considered impracticable. 
M. Bufaoir’s next proposal was accepted unanimously: It is desirable 
as an international custom to allow students the right to pass a part of 
their university terms at a foreign university. 
From M. Bufnoir’s next proposition the words “from a professional 
point of view” were at once eliminated. The conditions in different 
countries were so various that no profit could be derived from discuss- 
ing them. * 
M. Urechia, formerly minister of education in Roumania, desired the 
University of France to take the lead in forming an official congress in 
which every university would be represented; they would then settle. 
the minimum required for the various degrees. Such a federation of 
universities would then be able to settle all questions affecting the 
equivalence of degrees. The practical difficulties in the way of such a 
scheme were so great that the section passed on to the following reso- 
lution: It is desirable to grant, after evaluation, and without any distine- 
tion of nationality, the international equivalence of examination certifi- 
cates and degrees as the condition for trying for a higher degree. 
The section considering the advantages accruing to a student from 
. study at a foreign university and the advisability of maintaining a = 
high level of study by admitting to a faculty only those who were 
properly prepared, submits the above three resolutions to the congress. 
Besides this report of M. Th. Cart’s, M. Bufnoir, in an admirable 
speech, summed up the labors of his section, and made an eloquent 
protest against the tax laid on foreign students in France. 
In the first resolution the words “to maintain and to establish,” ete., 
were added on the proposition of M. Gentet. A remark that students 
in Germany were allowed to visit other universities was corrected by 
         
-P-A-G-E-100
  {4 EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
the observation that this permission applied only to medical students 
and philologists. 
On the motion of Mr. Lyulph Stanley, copies of the resolutions will 
be sent to all foreign universities. 
- Careful emphasis was laid on the point that the equivalence of de- 
grees was concerned only with the scientific side; the right to practice 
could, of course, only be granted by the state. 
The final form of the resolutions was as follows: . 
I, It is desirable to maintain and to establish the international equiv- 
alence of diplomas or certificates giving the right to pass from second- 
ary to higher education in its various forms. 
IL. It is desirable to recommend as an international custom to allow 
students the right to pass a part of their university terms at a foreign 
university. 
Ii. It is desirable to grant, after evaluation and without any dis- 
tinction of nationality, the international equivalence of examination 
certificates and degrees from the scientific point of view, as the condi- 
tion for trying for a higher degree. 
These resolutions were all accepted unanimously. The evident desire 
of the various speakers to remove, as far as possible, all the barriers 
to a free intercourse between university students, was one of the many 
pleasant features of the Congress. 
The various types of secondary instruction; what relative weight ought to 
be ascribed to the classics, to modern languages, and to science ? 
Fifty years ago, says M. Croiset, the sole type of secondary instrue- 
tion was the classical grammar school. The various substitutes or 
competitors suggested since may be considered as due to the demand 
for a modern type. 
Ts it feasible to teach one of the ancient languages without the other? 
How much science ought to be taught in a classical school? How 
much time can be given in it to modern languages? In a modern 
school without classics can a harmonious and disinterested culture be 
obtained, or must the school be content to give something between 
primary and secondary instruction of practical value and immediate 
application? Should a preponderance be given to science or to liter- 
_ ary culture, obtained from the native language? If Latin is necessary 
as an entrance to certain careers, the question ceases to be pedagogic; 
better leave it alone altogether unless the study can be pushed far 
enough to yield some some literary value. 
To sum up: 
(a) Ought not our modern secondary instruction to be literary in a 
larger degree? 
(b) Is it desirable to introduce Latin? 
(c) Ought not the teaching of modern languages to be made more 
important and more literary than it is at present?
-P-A-G-E-101
  EDUCATIONAL CONGRESSES AT PARIS IN 1889. 13 
M. Chassiotis desired a single school taking science and literature 
abreast up to the point where specialization had to come in.. M. Her- 
zen followed in the samesense. A full exposé of his views will be found 
in an article published since the Congress in the Revue Internationale 
(October 15, 1889), The classics promise much, he said, but the results 
are often deplorable; children are all forced into the same procrustean 
bed as they begin their study before any appreciation or capacity is 
possible. Since the object of secondary education is to give the widest 
possible general culture, bifurcation must be deferred till after the final 
school examination. 
The experience of City College, New York, and we may add the case 
of Miss Ramsay, the late senior classical, Cambridge, go to prove that 
the study of the classics suffers nothing from being begun late. Es- 
tablish a primary school for children from 7 to 12, so as to give a pro- 
visional selection; from 12 to 14 have an intermediate school with a 
definite selection of those fit to proceed to secondary education. 
M. Croiset replies that the experiments made at the Lycée Charle- 
magne, in imitation of City College, are not favorable. M. Michel 
Bréal fears overpressure if the study of Latin is put off till 12 or 13. 
M. Herzen aseribes overpressure to bad method rather than to the 
number of subjects. M. Collard says that the attempt to begin class- 
ics late had to be given up in Belgium. M. Herzen’s motion for post- 
ponement was not adopted. 
Must Latin and Greek be both maintained, asks the President? Al 
though in case of absolute need Latin should be sacrificed to Greek, it 
was felt that the two must stand or fall together. A German society 
for establishing a school teaching Greek and not Latin was still-born. 
The general assembly took up this question on August 8. The report 
was read by M. Max Egger and ran roughly as follows: 
Before entering on the study of the different forms of secondary edu- 
eation, the proper age at which to begin the classics was brought into 
discussion, Prof. Herzen desired that “the coupling of primary and 
secondary education should not take place before the end of the four- 
teenth year.” This was desirable on “ pedagogic, individual, and social 
grounds.” Teaching would then be given only to a body of pupils selected 
after a really serious intellectual examination such as was practiced at 
City College, New York. As the teachers would have only apt pupils 
before them, the instruction would be more sure of success, and the ele- 
ments excluded would have to take up with practical studies that were 
more suited to them. A large majority of the section agreed with M. 
: Bréal that the system suggested by M. Herzen would lead to. over- 
pressure; already in France, where the study of Latin does not be- 
gin till 11 or 12, there is a real connection between overpressure and 
putting off the study of the classics, because it has then to be com- 
pressed into a smaller number of years. The section agreed with M, 
Croiset that the study of the classics must be carried on leisurely in  
-P-A-G-E-102
      74 | EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
order to be fruitful; only by a direct and protracted intercourse will the 
pupil read the ancient authors and enter into their ideas. What will 
happen if we put off the beginning, not till11 or 12, but tol4? Another 
objection was pointed out by MM. Harlaux and Hurdebise, viz, that 
the method of elimination proposed by M. Herzen would drive many 
into private schools, where they would receive a classical education 
denied them by the state, and thus public education would lose in value 
and respect. 
That being settled, the next proposition was received without dis- 
cussion: Jt is desirable to recognize and to establish several forms of 
secondary education. 
In laying down the general character of the various forms, the see- 
tion began with the oldest: It is desirable to make the study of Greek 
and Latin simultaneous and obligatory. 
M. Herzen’s proposal to make the study of Greek optional was re- 
jected. Every optional subject, even if you can find amateurs to teach 
it, tends to overpressure, Besides there is no reason why a pupil good 
at Latin should not be good at Greek as well, though the latter is some- 
what harder, 
“You can not eliminate Greek from any genuine classical education, 
as its aim ought to be to develop the mind by tracing the affiliation of 
ideas and the progress of civilization to their Greek and Latin sources; 
as far as the ideas and formsof classical literature are concerned, what 
we get from Greece is not only of great value in itself, but is the 
origin of what has come to us through Roman civilization,” said Mr. 
Lyulph Stanley. “A school can not make Greek optional,” said M. 
Cart, “for Latin must be taught in different ways to those who do and 
to those who do not learn Greek.” 
For the second type of school, for those who intend to follow ascien- 
| tific career, the one ancient language to be admitted was obviously 
Latin. 
A proposal in Germany, said M. Erkelenz, to make Greek the sole 
ancient language taught in school, never came to anything. The section 
then adopted this resolution: It is desirable to admit another type of see- 
ondary education in which Latin would be the only ancient language 
taught. 
What would be the position of science and modern languages in these 
two types of school? The section adopted the opinions of M. Croiset 
in his article: For the future men of science it is desirable to make the 
general culture as ample as possible before they get absorbed in their 
specialties; for the future men of letters an adequate training in the 
intellectual faculties, touched by s science, was necessary. The section 
formulated its opinion thus: 
In both types of secondary education, the study of science, although sub- 
ordinated to the study of literature, ought to be seriously carried out, that 
ts to say, slowly, gradually, and methodically; for the pupils destined to a
-P-A-G-E-103
  EDUCATIONAL CONGRESSES AT PARIS IN 1889, 15 
scientific career, separation and consequently specialization ought to be 
put off as long as possible, 
For modern languages the section at first voted this formula: It is 
desirable to make the teaching of foreign languages practical in the lower 
classes and literary in the higher. The pupil as he gradually grows 
interested in the ideas of the Greeks and Romans would naturally 
demand a literary flavor in his study of modern languages. When 
ought he to begin? M. Gauthiot wanted to commence as late as possi- 
ble, as the pupils retain only what they learn last. To this the section 
replied that it was undesirable to put off the study of modern languages 
till the middle of the classical course, with the intention of doubling 
the time devoted to them in the higher classes. Besides, it is not so 
certain that the pupil forgets so readily. When he is young he can 
retain words by memory, and the greater flexibility of his organs makes 
‘ a correct pronunciation easier. : 
What are we to understand by practical teaching? One party agreed 
with M. Rabier, in relegating the art of writing and speaking to a second- 
ary position. Reading is more important not only from an intellectual 
point of view, but practically as well; by reading we get to know books, - 
reviews, journals, and to learn the literary, scientific, and commercial 
condition of a country; in actual life we have more often to read than 
to write or speak. 
Another party thought, with M. Bréal, that the possession of a modern 
language ought to be active; the value of exercises and translations 
had been exaggerated; the best teacher is theone who never pronounces 
a word to the pupils, in class, of their native language; from an inter- 
national point of view it is desirable that the pupils in a lyeée should 
be accustomed to express themselves in a foreign language; they would 
then wish to perfect thémselves abroad, not with a view to talking to 
a guide or to hotel-keeping, but to study at a university or to mix with 
the educated classes of the country they were traveling in. 
M. Gréard reconciled both parties with the following resolution ~ 
adopted by the section: In the study of a modern language, two things 
are to be acquired—the possession of the language and an acquaintance with 
its best literature. Finally a third type was accepted, with the name 
given to it by M. Croiset, a secondary modern education, having for 
aim a harmonious and disinterested culture of the mind. His formula 
at the end of this article was accepted, with an important alteration in 
the first resolution: 
(1) This education ought to be both scientific and literary. (2) Latin 
will not be admitted in it. (8) It is desirable to give greater weight to the 
teaching of modern languages and to make it more literary than it is at 
present. The object in insisting on the words greater weight and literary 
was to show that the teaching, without neglecting the practical side, 
should elevate the intelligence and the feelings of the young and make 
the whole of this modern instruction attractive. 
       
-P-A-G-E-104
  76 EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
The discussion opened with M. Herzen’s proposal to make the sec- 
ondary and primary schools fit into one another for children of the age 
of 14; this was rejected.* 
M. Micé desired that the higher primary school should be transformed 
into a professional school so as not to compete with the secondary school, 
but his motion was put aside as trenching on the primary congress. 
The resolutions of the section were then taken in order. The president 
_ explained that the types might be reduced to three, as was the case in 
Belgium: (1) Classical; (2) Latin without Greek; (3) Modern, without 
Latin or Greek. After a few remarks the general assembly accepted 
the resolution : 
I. It is desirable to recognize and to establish several forms of sec- 
ondary education. 
For the second question the president pointed out that the section 
had decided against making Greek optional for fear of overpressure 
and the Congress had already implicitly accepted asecondary type 
with Latin only. Mr. Lyulph Stanley supported the views of the sec- 
tion, adding that if one of the ancient languages had to be sacrificed 
Latin should go before Greek. The assembly accepted the resolution 
of the section: 
If, It is desirable to make the study of Greek and Latin simultane- 
ous and obligatory. 
A pleasant change from the sober propriety of a public meeting was 
afforded by the aminated talk, chiefly among the French members of 
the Congress, set going by the discussion on the proper name to apply 
to the type of school teaching Latin without Greek. 
Ought “classical” to be retained as denoting an education with a 
disinterested aim? Would “semiclassical,” “Latin humanities” do? 
At last, with more accuracy than elegance, the following names were 
given to the three types: Hnseignement classique gréco-latin; humanités 
latines; enseignement secondaire moderne scientifico-littéraire. The reso- 
~ lution of the section was then adopted in the form: 
III. It is desirable to admit another type of secondary education,in 
which Latin will be the only ancient language taught. 
For the classical school a fair amount of science was considered nec- 
essary, less, of course, than in the “Latin humanities,” and still less 
than in the modern school. 
The report of the section on modern languages was adopted on the 
whole. Both MM. Rosenfeld and Dietz claimed that the time given to 
them should be increased in all the classes. The Congress accepted M. 
Lyulph Stanley’s formula: 
IV. In the lower classes as large an amount of time as the other 
branches of instruction will admit should be given to modern lan- 
guages. 
  
* A full statement of M. Herzen’s views may be found in the Revue internationale, 
October, 1889.
-P-A-G-E-105
  EDUCATIONAL CONGRESSES AT PARIS IN 1889. 77 
M. Morel then insisted that the chief weight in the teaching should 
be laid on reading the best authors, in which he was supported by 
Mme. Griseri and M. Erkelenz. : 
_ If, said M. Bréal, the method of learning the ancient languages was 
applied to the modern he should protest. They would then be on a 
false track. After so many years of study can we say that we are really 
in possession of Greek and Latin? We only possess a language when 
we speak it. To understand a text is not enough. To be able to 
manipulate a language showed mental agtivity; and conversation, even 
though inaccurate, proved the possession of more knowledge of a 
language than a translation, dug out of the dictionary, of Goethe or 
Shakespeare. : x 
If, then, the insistence on the word literary meant the application to 
modern languages of a method proper for the classics that-method 
would be wrong. The point was not to compare, but to comprehend; 
the best teacher of a foreign language would be the one who did not 
use a native word during the lesson. Comparisons are only of use to 
the student who has a good command of both languages. With re- 
gard to modern secondary education M. Morel explained that the sec- 
tion had altered the words of M. Croiset’s article “literary in a large 
degree” into “scientific and literary.” M. Dietz preferred that the 
modern type of education should be principally literary and proposed 
a motion to that effect, which was lost. Science, said M. Micé, is too 
important to be relegated to a second place. As to the réle of Latin 
in the modern school the most contradictory opinions found expres- - 
sion. When at last the president put the question “Ought Latin to be 
retained?” it was negatived and another motion to make Latin optional 
was promptly rejected. Thus the final resolutions accepted ran: 
V. Modern secondary education ought to be both scientific and 
literary. Latin will not be admitted in it. Greater weight ought to 
be given to the teaching of modern languages, and it ought to be made 
more literary than it is at present. 
By what methods ought secondary instruction in modern languages and 
science to be given to girls? . 
This question was taken by the General Assembly on August 9 and 
naturally called forth considerable discussion. 
For modern languages an article had been written by M. Bossert, 
which to an Englishman seems intensely French. Is the study of the 
classics more likely to produce a bluestocking than that of modern lan- 
guages? Then a boy studying classics will be more of a pedant than 
his brother on the modern side. ~ 
“A woman,” says M. Bossert, “learns a foreign language as an orna- 
ment for her mind, a help in conversation, a backbone for her leisure 
hours, and a means of communication with her fellows. She lives in the 
present, and after her duties to her family she, is made for society.”  
-P-A-G-E-106
  18 EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
The teaching at first will be almost entirely by imitation to enable her 
' to express her thoughts in a foreign language; by means of written 
work the grammar can be employed by way of control; above all, the 
teacher must avoid being dull. For the literature read rather those 
authors who, “without being the most perfect, express the peculiar 
genius of their native country most faithfully; they seem to have a 
more delicate ear for that voice which speaks in the bosom of a nation.” 
The report on modern-language teaching was read by Mme. Soult. 
Our section was of opinion that the practical teaching of modern 
languages ought to begin as soon as possible, and the theoretical to 
be put off till the child had acquired the first notions of grammar in his 
native tongue. By beginning the practical teaching early the chitd 
gets accustomed to the foreign sounds and learns easily how to pro- 
nounce the foreign words. The study of the vocabularies, which Miss 
Beale aptly called the gymnastics of the language, can be done without 
too much strain by constant repetition, and by learning slowly the 
child will learn well. 
The teaching must be oral; the child will get accustomed to speak 
and to understand a foreign language when it is spoken to him; of 
course some notions of grammar must be given, as it is not possible to 
speak correctly without it. This needs~a great deal of time. In our 
secondary schools English and German must be begun as soon as possi- 
ble, say at the age of 8 or 9; teachers had been demanding for some 
time at least half an hour a day in the lower classes for a foreign lan- 
. guage, and this claim ought to be granted, as it would only amount to 
two. hours and a half a week, while in England and the United States 
six hours a week were given to moflern languages. 
The strictly theoretical teaching, that is to say, the study of the 
syntax, of comparative grammar, of foreign literatures, ought to be 
commenced as soon as the children had learned to express themselves 
with some facility, when, at 12 or 13, say, they had overcome the ele- 
- mentary difficulties of theirown tongue. Theoretical instruction ought, 
then, to take a large share in the teaching of modern languages. In- 
deed, it was not enough to speak one or more foreign languages; their 
study ought to have something more than a practical aim; they ought 
to afford a means of education, to develop the mind, to elevate the feel- 
_ ings,and widen the circle of knowledge; for with girls foreign languages 
ought to take the place of the classics. By comparative grammar they 
will better learn their own; by translation they will become accustomed 
to expressing new ideas in their own language; by translating into a 
foreign language they will learn to apply the rules of syntax. At this 
point girls may be introduced to the great works of foreign literatures, 
taking at first modern authors, until they have ripeness of mind enough 
and a deep enough knowledge to understand the beauties and delica- 
cies of the foreign tongue. 
In nearly all countries the children study two or more foreign lan- 
guages. In France they take English or German. If the teaching
-P-A-G-E-107
  EDUCATIONAL CONGRESSES AT PARIS IN 1889. 79 
began sooner it would be possible after three or four years to add a 
. second language without injury to the first; indeed this is what many 
pupils do privately at, home, 
Both practical and theoretical teaching have their special importance. 
The practical, appealing rather to the memory, to the flexibility of the 
organs, ought, of course, to precede the theoretical, where reasoning 
and analysis come into play. 
On one point we were all agreed: Linguistic studies are not truly 
fruitful unless we awake such a love for them that the children on leay- 
ing school continue to read English and German books, unless they 
visit the countries whose languages they have learned, just asa large 
number of strangers come every year to study our language and our 
literature. 
After a chatty exchange of opinion, mainly between the ladies pres- 
ent, the general assembly accepted the first resolution: 
I. The practical teaching of modern languages ought to begin as soon 
as possible. 
On the next resolution M. Bossert remarked that it was necessary 
to start with some sort of vocabulary. In the grammar it was advis- 
able to distinguish between that which passed from the example to the 
rule—to be begun as soon as possible—and that which passed from the 
rule to the example—to be put off as long as possible. 
With this reservation the second resolution was adopted: 
il. Theoretical teaching ought to be put off until preliminary notions 
have been acquired in the mother tongue. 
The president remarked that as the study of modern languages is 
a branch of general culture it is flesirable that girls should travel in 
the country. whose tongues they had learned. In reply to a question 
from M. Herzen, he said that Latin would be optional in secondary 
schools for girls. 
M. Dietz made a proposal to the effect that in the lower classes of 
girls’ schools the same teacher should take, as far as possible, both the 
native and the foreign language. In this way time would be saved. 
M. Erkelenz was of opinion that in this ease the girls would lean 
school knowing neither thoroughly. 
M. G. Morel pointed out the practical difficulty of finding such 
teachers. Be 
On tite motion of Miss Beale it was held desirable to seek a general 
formulary for grammatical terms. . 
One of the speakers thought it desirable to teach the Single sounds 
of a foreign language at starting. This was said to be impossible, as 
an ordinary speaker can not pronounce the single sounds in his native 
language by themselves, e. g., the o in the English not. For some time 
the teacher must be content to bathe the ears of the children in the 
foreign sounds, without demanding any reproduction from them. Since 
the native habit of the tongue is a natural hindrance a thorough gym-

nastic in the home language of the organs of speech must come first. 
The assembly accepted from Mr. Widgery a motion affirming the need 
of a practical and theoretical knowledge of phonetics for the language- 
teacher. ) 
Another important consideration may be added: it is undesirable, as 
M. Cart says, for a teacher and his class to belong to different nations; 
if then an Englishman has to teach English boys French, and simple 
imitation be as a rule powerless to give even a fairly good pronuncia- 
tion, phonetics become imperative. In England a foreign teacher is 
nearly always chosen because of his “good accent;” but what is the 
value of the most perfect accent if the children have not the skill to 
imitate and the teacher has no knowledge of the physiological produc- 
tion of the sounds he is uttering? Not the possession of knowledge, 
but the power to impart it, is our primary want in the school. Pupils 
often turn out better artists than their drawing masters, and it is quite 
_ possible that a phonetically trained teacher may obtain from his chil- 
dren a better pronunciation than he is capable of himself. M. Michel 
Bréal pointed out the importance of geographical considerations in 
determining the foreign language to be taken up in the,school curric- 
ulum. In the south of France, Spanish and Italian would replace the 
German and English of the north. May not a similar argument be 
applied to the vexed question of Latin? If we determine the amount 
necessary for secondary schools by the historic intimacy of a country 
with Latin, the maximum will be in Italy and the minimum in Scan- 
dinavia, with England and Germany somewhere midway. 
The Latin barometer, so to speak, steadily sinks as it moves northward. 
The lack of any reference to the vigorous movement for reform asso- 
ciated in England with the names of A. J. Ellis and Henry Sweet, in 
Norway with Johan Storm, and in Germany with Perthes and Victor 
was as striking as the marked tendency to keep the education of boys 
and girls apart and to refuse admittance to optional subjects. 
A page sufficed for M. Darboux’s article on mathematics. The right 
method in arithmetic, a few rules and simple sums, gradually followed 
by reasoning and if possible the complete theory, he thought fairly set- 
tled; is it desirable to add a little algebra? For geometry might not 
the limit be put at the didactic teaching of the rules for the area and 
volume of the regular bodies, while pointing out their application to ar- 
chitecture and the fine arts? The teaching of cosmography is admit- 
tedly difficult. In France two stages are kept strictly apart, the first 
displaying the planets in their orbits round the sun, the comets, the 
stars, and the nebule, and the second dealing with more difficult points, 
such as eclipses, the calendar, the inequality of day and night. 
Are we to teach physical science to girls, asks M. E. Perrier, in his 
article, to develop the mind, or to give a simple résumé of every-day 
  
*A possible method of doing this in the case of English will be found in the Edu- 
ucational Times (London) of January, 1890,

  EDUCATIONAL CONGRESSES AT PARIS IN 1889. 81 
knowledge, useful in housekeeping? Can we combine both points of 
view by presenting scientific facts of every-day life in their scientific 
connection? The teaching must of course be experimental, but how 
far should the study of physics and chemistry be carried? Ought 
hygiene to be separated from them? The narrowest programme would 
admit some organic chemistry. Should fermentations and the morbid 
action of bacteria be the limit? Cuvier saw in the natural sciences an 
admirable means of mental discipline in order. Has not the prejudice 
against classification been carried too far, especially since the method 
of considering an animal in his own environment has transformed the 
old categories? Although the study of living animals might be made 
to have a philosophic value, physiology must take the first place in the 
education of girls, as it gives a reason for the rules of hygiene. 
Our deliberations began with a general question: Ought we to teach 
girls everything that they can learn? Since they can learn the same 
subjects as their brothers ought they to receive the same education in ~ 
a mixed school or would it be better to make a special curriculum for 
the girls? Our section agreed in desiring that no barrier should be 
raised against the entrance of women to the university. Let those 
whose tasks and abilities lead them to higher studies take their degrees; 
we can trust to their good sense the uSe they will make of them. 
Only a small number, however, will want this higher education. The 
majority leave school about 16 and return home, where other duties de- 
volve upon them. This consideration, joined to the question of health, 
of physical and moral delicacy, led ‘the section to deliberate upon the 
proper method of teaching science to the latter class. How could their 
minds be made firm and clear? How could they become stronger and 
more intelligent and fit to fulfill their proper role in society? 
From mathematics we may hope to gain a discipline for the mind and 
an initiation into method. Algebr'a, by simplifying the difficult proe- 
esses of arithmetic, raises the teaching from the particular to the gen- 
eral and lends precision to the other sciences. Geometry accustoms 
us to see and to reason accurately, besides being the link between art 
and the abstract sciences; cosmography brings light into geographical 
work and interests the pupil in the cosmic order of the universe. 
These three sciences must find a place in our curriculum and we ac- 
cepted M. Darboux’s propositions. 
The inductive and experimental method should be followed, &nd all 
the various branches of physical science, split up though they are at 
present, should be introduced. The limit will be reached when the re- 
sults can not be foreseen or verified; all mathematical demonstrations 
will be avoided and all theories beyond the grasp of young minds will 
be carefully excluded. The teaching must be in every case experimental. 
The favorite science among girls is natural history. The study of ani- 
-mals and plants excites their curiosity and develops their powers of 
ED 90 6

  82 EDUCATION REPORT, 1839-00, 
observation, while the knowledge of the physical constitution of man 
leads up to that of his mind and heart. Hygiene is one application of 
physiological studies, and we ask the Congress to-approve of our reso- 
lution that hygiene should always be connected with the natural sci- 
ences of which it is an application. 
The general assembly practically accepted the articles of M. Dar- 
boux and M. Perrier. The final resolutions were: 
I. It is desirable to teach algebra to girls in secondary schools in 
order to raise the standard of the teaching they receive; arithmetic, 
_ especially, is simplified by the study of algebra. Continued repetition 
is necessary; at first the rules and simple problems must be given, 
theories and processes of reasoning being gradually introduced. 
IL. Geometry ought to be taught as a mental discipline. 
Ill. In the elementary classes the teaching of cosmography ought to 
be mainly picturesque and in the higher mainly mathematical. 
. IV. Physical science. The teaching ought to be general and ex- 
perimental, covering all the various branches. ‘ a 
V. Chemistry. The teaching ought tc be experimental and elemen- 
tary. 
‘VI. Natural history. Only the fundamental elements ought to be 
taught and experimentally as faras possible. 
On the place of economic and social science in higher education. 
A luminous article on the fifth question was due to M. E. Boutmy, 
- the director of the Hole libre des sciences politiques, and a representa- 
tive in the high council of instruction free from state contrel. To 
what faculty does sociology—to use a shorter word—belong? Political 
economy became scientific at the hands of Adam Smith, who was pro- 
fessor of moral philosophy. Considering life as made up of sympathy 
and interest, and holding himself quit of the former in his “ Theory of 
‘| Moral Sentiments,” he limited his “Wealth of Nations” to the latter. 
_ Treated after his death by the deductive method the science grew 
“dismal.” At present deduction is suspect and the vast number of 
| facts accumulated in a century of laborious work tended to bring the 
science out of the psychologic stage into the category of observation. 
- Indeed, the flourishing school started in Germany by L. Brentano holds 
_ that the time is not ripe yet for generalization; provisionally political 
economy must be put out to nurse with empiricism. 
_ Limited to an investigation of the useful, economic science will recog- 
- nize that its conclusions have only a restricted value, complementary 
to a psychology embracing the whole man. Checked by history and 
geography the abstract laws of the science will need modification for 
different countries, while statistics and demography, its latest auxilia- 
ries, will keep it in touch with mathematics and biology. 
With law, except on its commercial and administrative side, together 
_ with the modern development of state socialism, economic science has

no fruitful relation. The founders of economic science shut it up in a 
sort of peninsula, attached to the mainland of moral philosophy, but, 
tendencies due chiefly to Comte have brought more into light the con- 
nection of economic with social science, whose chief auxiliary is history 
in its largest sense. 
If sociology can not practically as things are have a faculty to itself, 
where can it find a home? In Germany, the extraordinary plasticity of 
the university system as embodied in the Privatdocenten, renders the 
introduction of new and budding sciences facile, while leaving them free 
to choose theiz most natural resting place. In other countries the strict 
organization of studies renders the action of government necessary to 
introduce anything fresh and original. Considerations of practical ex- 
pediency, rather than of science, determine where the old will accept the 
new. 
Among Germanic races there seems to be an inherent fundamental 
tendency to treat all questions from the historic standpoint; men and 
things are in an incessant evolution; no final statement comprising 
unchangeable rules is possible. 
With Latin races the logical instinct is more imperious; their interest 
in a subject is rather to establish the coherency and connection of its 
different parts than to trace its past development. Like artists, they 
flatter themselves that they can fix the expression of truth once and 
for all. 
A distinction real, though vanishing, exists between nations with a 
written law and nations with a historic law. 
In Germany, and still more in America, the tendency of sociology has 
been to group itself with history; in France, Italy, and Spain, with law.* 
M. G. Blondel read the report to the general assembly on August 10. 
In order to facilitate the discussion of the many points raised in M. 
Boutmy’s article, the president of the section, M. Bufnoir, div. ues the 
general question for discussion under four heads: 
(1) Is there anywhere an organized teaching of the whole range of 
the economic and social sciences? How much does this teaching in- 
clude? What sanction has this teaching? What preliminary tests are 
imposed on students who wish to follow this teaching? 
(2) Is it desirable to reeommend the organization of such teaching? 
How much ought it to include?) What sanction will it have? What 
preliminary tests ought to be imposed? 
(3) Can this teaching be put under any of the existing studies, either 
by being attached to some definite faculty or by spreading it among 
various faculties? 
(4) In any case is it not desirable to recommend in the faculty of law 
the development of the study of the various branches of political econ- 
  
*The above résumé is much shorter than M. Boutmy’s article, which well deserves 
an attentive study. It was published with the other articles by the Lnprimerie 
Nationale.

omy? Might not this development be usefully combined with the teach- 
_ ing of various branches of common law in such a way as to offer a body 
of subjects adapted to the needs of young men entering on careers in 
the government offices, diplomatic or consular service, or political life? 
The section immediately stated its opinion that social science was not 
taught anywhere with the fullness it deserved. . 
Some interesting information was given us by the Marquis Alfieri, of 
the school founded by him in Florence. The teaching comprises sev- 
enteen subjects, of which the majority come under law; being attached 
to a school of notaries, the scientific side has been rather sacrificed to 
the practical. The students belong to the well-to-do classes and wish 
to prepare themselves for public appointments or political life. The 
diploma granted by the Florence school opens the way to many careers, 
and more especially to the diplomatic service. The students must be 
bachelors, and they are readily received in many occupations. At 
Bologna, as we were informed by M. Gandenzi, a similar school exists, 
but it is intimately connected with the university. The only three 
courses of lectures given are simply complementary to those in the fae- 
ulty of law. M. de Medveezky stated that in Germany the lectures 
came under philosophy as a rule, and in Austria-Hungary under law. 
The students belong very often to several faculties. A considerable 
knowledge is looked on as the necessary base for these studies, which 
are crowned by a special degree in social science. At Berlin, accord- 
ing to M. Georges Hulin, the majority of the students work without 
any interested motive. 
From M. Van der Rest we learned that Brussels has recently made a 
plan for teaching social science by mviting the coéperation of the pro- 
fessors in the various faculties. 
For the first three headings the section was not able to formulate 
anything more precise than M. Dreyfus-Brisac’s motion: “It is desir- 
able in higher education to pay greater attention than has been done in 
the past to economic and political science.” The difficulty of arriving 
at a precise statement was increased by the phrase social science, which 
may be made to include everything that bears on the historical devel- 
_ opment or the study of the constitution of human society. M. Van 
der Rest protested strongly against M. Boutmy’s opinion that political 
economy had no intimate and fruitful connection with law. 
M. Urechia informed us that an attempt had recently been made in 
Roumania to found a school for social science; no diploma but a leay- 
ing certificate was granted. The students were preferred by the Gov- 
ernment for public posts. 
Opinions varied as to the best authority under which to place the 
study. Some were dubious of university teaching and preferred spe- 
cial schools, where a thoroughly practical instruction could be given, 
while others thought it would be better if the universities enlarged 
their borders to adinit the new studies. They are too numerous and  
-P-A-G-E-113
  
  EDUCATIONAL CONGRESSES AT PARIS IN 1889. 85 
varied to come under the faculty of law, and yet until the different por- 
tions of social science are more closely solidified it seems undesirablé 
to increase the number of faculties. 
The Congress felt itself still less capable than the specialists of for- 
mulating any exact scheme and contented itself with accepting M. 
Dreyfus-Brisac’s motion: 
“It is desirable in higher education to pay greater attention than has 
been done in the past to economic and social science.” 
The work of the Congress summed wp.—The labors of the Congress were 
summed up by M. Gréard, in a speech frequently interrupted by ap- 
plause: : 
The session of the Congress has been long and laborious; I hope it will be fruitful. 
On all the questions bronght under your notice, there has been an important exchange 
of opinion. In some ¢ases you have come to resolutions fit for immediate applica- 
tion. The secondary education of girls has not occupied you least, and with justice; 
is not the question the most delicate. and the latest born? Two points stand out 
from your discussions; the first is, that the education of girls ought not to be an 
artificial vencer, for them no less than for the boys the proper aim is the acquisition 
of a certain amount of well digested knowledge and the training of the mind; the 
second is that though assistance should not be refused to women capable of raising 
themselvs above the ordinary level, secondary education, being intended for the 
average mind, ought to be regulated according to the conditions of time, health, 
social position, and ability, common to the majority, and that it ought to aim at 
preparing girls for family life of which they are destined to become the moral sup- 
port and attraction. 
Taking into account the mass of knowledge heaped up in the programmes of all © 
countries, and the impossibility of making everybody learn everything in the same 
uniform and encyclopedic manner, you have recognized the need of diversifying the 
types of secondary schools. You have from the first proclaimed the imperative need 
of maintaining and strengthening the type founded on the knowledge of the classics, 
a study that has long been the cradle of thinking humanity, and is still to-day a 
bond between minds of the first rank. But by the side of this purely classical edu- 
cation, you have thought it possible for those who have to reserve a part of their 
time and powers for other subjects to establish another type resting on an adequate 
knowledge of one ancient language, the one nearest to us in grammar and ideas; I 
mean Latin. Considering, however, that our modern civilization has so many needs 
and interests to satisfy, you have agreed that there is room for another typein which 
the base should be the study of our own tongue, coupled with that of modern lan- 
guages; this is what is described as a modern education; it may be called modern 
and real if you will, the word matters little when it is agreed that for it, as for the 
other two, the aim is a disinterested culture of the mind. 
By the way you have considered the question of the proper method for teaching 
modern languages; the important point with some was to acquire a practical control 
over the language; others insisted on the advantage for young neople of reading 
great works of a foreign literature, firmly convinced that although a modern lan- 
guage ought to be spoken at first, yet one not spoken contributed to another com- 
merce none the less precious, the commerce with the feelings and thoughts of those 
who have left in their works their best. 
The baccalauréat gave rise to contradictory arguments. You readily agreed on 
the necessity for some sanction to secondary education, a sanction coming naturally 
at the end of regular class work, in which the marks obtained during the school 
life should count. The difficulties surrounding the composition of the jury called 
    
           
-P-A-G-E-114
    86 EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. \ 
to grant this sanction made you hesitate in an expression of opinion. It was clear, 
however, that those juries, made independently of the ordinary class masters, need 
amendment in order to obtain a more satisfactory direction of studies and a greater 
surety in the result of the examination. 
For higher education the questions proposed were of great importance. The ~ 
Congress has made but a sort of preliminary investigation on the place of sociology. 
Your ideas and plans of organization will be valuable to those who are genuinely 
interested in the moral future of the world. 
It was easier to come to conclusions in the examination of the mternational 
equivalence of degrees. Leaving on one side the application of the degrees to the 
practical exercise of a profession, a matter of interest to the State, you have liber- 
ally and wisely affirmed the desirability in the realm of pure science of doing away 
with useloss and harmful barriers, without trenching on the authority necessary to 
great academic bodies, intrusted with the charge of higher education; you have 
opened the way to intercourse, communication and reciprocal penetration to the 
great benefit of science and the fraternal feelings which she awakes and sustains. 
Had your labors ended but in this resolution they would have been enough to 
characterize and to justify this Congress. There are still disappointed men who ask, 
with a touch of scepticism, ‘What is the use of a congress? Would not an ex- 
_ change of papers, where everybody could find what he wanted, be enough?” Papers 
-certainly play an important part in our studies; there is no use in denying this; 
they pave the way, they clear up and complete discussions. But are the living 
communications, that lend warmth, power, all the charms of the spoken word to 
thought, nothing? Conversations such as we have had, are of necessity somewhat 
hurried through the limit of time, and they can not haye the precision of a book; 
and although I should not deny that our reports contain certain inaccuracies andl 
contradictions in details, the important thing to do was to lay down the principles 
that are the light and soul of things, and this you have done. But neither papers, 
nor books, I affirm, could have evoked the sympathy that the discussion has caused 
among those whom liberal views have brought together. + 
A common thought has more than once shown itself clearly in your discussions; 
the resolutions you have taken ought to be communicated to all-the bodies they af- 
fect; our study ought to be followed up and brought to a successful issue by the 
perseverance of all countries; in short, the international bond that you have created 
ought to be maintainted, enlarged, and strengthened. 
This wish you have left with us. It will not be our fault if it is not realized. 
  The electric stream of sympathy set going by the President was in 
“no whit diminished by the foreign delegates, M. Laskowsky, Mr. Stan- 
ley, M. Basiadis, and Mme. Griseri, who thanked M. Gréard for the tact 
_ and fairness with which he had presided over the Congress, ae 
through him, they thanked France for her hospitality. 
3B.—THE EXHIBITION AND CONGRESSES ON SPECIAL SUBJECTS. 
PART I.—THE EXHIBITION. 
Section I.—PRELIMINARY. 
The preliminaries for the exhibition relating to primary instruction were put in 
train by M. Berthelot, who, on April 4, 1887, appointed a commission of eighty-nine 
members, with MM. Gréard and F. Buisson at its head. The commission sent a 
report to the Government on June 27, based on the labors of six committees, who 
entered fully into the necessary details. This report was followed on July 31 by a 
_ general instruction from M. E, Spuller, in which emphasis was laid’ on the need of
-P-A-G-E-115
  
e 
  EDUCATIONAL CONGRESSES AT PARIS IN 1889. 87 
a complete and faithful presentation of public primary instruction. An offer of free 
space was made to all those who, participating in the great work of national educa- 
tion, were desirous of exhibiting under the auspices of the minister. 
Of the nine great groups into which the whole Exhibition was divided, education, 
occupying classes 67 and 68, was included with the liberal arts under group 2. In 
the second volume of the General Official Catalogue the exhibits were arranged in 
each class, first under countries and then under the names of the exhibitors, with, 
finally, the place in the Exhibition grounds, the word “Esplanade” often occurring 
wrongly in-the place of “Palais” (des Arts Libéraux). The catalogue necded a great 
deal of study before it could be effectively used. 
Primary instruction occupied class 6, and was divided into sections, each of the 
seven sections being arranged under three distinct heads: installation, method, re- 
sults. Installation comprised plans of: school buildings, furniture, and teaching 
apparatus; under method, specimens of copy and exercise books, registers of attend- 
ance, rewards, school societies, savings banks, games and discipline, visits and holi- 
day resorts, books used in school; under results, specimens of the pupils’ work. For 
the latter special pains were taken to avoid any abuse. Under no pretense were 
exercise books, drawings, or maps admitted that had been prepared with a special 
    view to the exhibition. The obvious wisdom of this precaution was enhanced by the 
selection of work done, not by a selected few of the best scholars, but by the ordinary 
average child, 2 
_ It is unnecessary to enter more fully into the rules and regulations laid down, as 
we shall find them translated into practice in the Exhibition. The elaborate sets 
of questions addressed to the various bodies of teachers, the shapes and sizes of the 
objects to be exhibited, and other matters of the highest value to future organizers, 
will be found in the thirty-eighth fascicule of the publications of the Musée Péda- 
gogique: L’ Exposition scolaire de 1589.* 
Armed with this preliminary knowledge, we descend the slope of the Trocadero 
gardens; our delight in the delicate elegance of the Eiffel tower passes into amaze- 
ment at its size and strength when we stand underneath. We ascend to get a cléar 
view of the buildings, and we see the vast Machinery Building running parallel to 
the Seine and at right angles to the main axis of the Exhibition grounds. Another 
set of buildings, we learn from our guidebook, is devoted to the miscellaneous 
French groups, and two wings, one on the left for fine arts and the other on the right 
for the liberal arts, run nearly up to the tower, leaving the gardens in the center. 
Directly beneath us a motley group of buildings are dotted over the grass in the 
gayest confusion. Mexico finds herself a near neighbor to the Argentine Republic 
and a restaurant, while Chile can look into Venezuela or the Children’s Palace. 
The Quai @’Orsay couples the Colonial Exhibition on the Esplanade des Invalides 
with the Champ de Mars. On the other side of the river the Trocadero, perched on 
its slight hill, seems to protect with its curving wings the Exhibition from the outer 
world. A request for a general catalogue produced eight volumes, but a few hours © 
spent in examining them were well repaid. The first two groups, art and educa- 
tion, were devoted to intellectual labor; the others showed the mechanical processes 
needed to supply man’s most primitive wants—a dwelling, clothes, and food, 
Several days were needed merely to walk through the various galleries. Unlike 
earlier exhibitions, the arrangement was not by countries as a whole, but by sub- 
jects, an excellent change for purposes of international comparison—the relative 
strength and weakness in any section being at once obvious. The strength of Switz- 
erland, for example, in machinery must have been a great surprise both to for- 
eigners and to the Swiss. To obtain, however, a general idea of the resources of any 
particular country necessitated a great number of visits to very different quarters, 
accompanied by a fear that something was sure to be overlooked. A strong feeling

of half-angry disappointment was inevitable as soon as it became clear that the 
official political boycott of the Government had been extended to the Exhibition. 
Surely it would have been enough for the ambassadors to have been absent from the 
_ various political fétes. France did not refuse to send to London and Melbourne. 
- From an educational point of view the absence of Germany was a heavy loss, espe- 
cially for England, who has begun her educational reform so late and needs, above 
all, the awakening of a pedagogic sense. 
Even in France the schools belonging to the various religious bodies were not rep- 
resented. If the object was to weaken those who refuse to allow the school to be a 
weapon of sectarian propaganda, it failed utterly. Abstention did but help to throw 
into higher relief the logical and comprehensive grasp taken by the Government of 
the whole field of education from the cradle to the university. The honor of dis- 
playing the completest educational exhibition the world has yet seen belongs to a 
secular government with a secular programme. France and Switzerland alone made 
an adequate educational display, and in both the main weight was laid on primary 
and technical schools. With all these restrictions, however, there was enough for 
the most inveterate sight-seer, and for the student a month’s work would hardly suf- 
fice for a single group. 
Let us turn to the special subject in hand. We walk toward the wing of the lib- 
eral arts; we pass the colossal statue of Buddha placidly smiling on the crowd be- 
neath, and mount the staircase with the reflection that the East sits and meditates 
while the West stands and works. A thousand objects challenge our attention, but 
we enter class 6 and find a long corridor parceled out into eight large rooms by 
partitions springing right and left from the walls. Down the center runs a series of 
glass cases. In spite of this liberal space M. Messin, to whom the task of organiza- 
tion fell, found that only a part of the objects sent by the various exhibitors could 
be shown. Handicraft is certainly the watchword of the day. All the walls in the 
first room were covered with work in wood and iron, sent by various higher primary 
schools and training colleges. 
The programmes reach down to the maternal school and regulate the minutest 
details of procedure. The strongest opponent of such a method can hardly deny 
that the programmes afford good educational reading. For each of the three stages 
into which primary school life is divided there is a separate programme, and cach is 
divided into the three rubrics of physical, intellectual, and moral. 
Srcrion I].—Ciry or Panis. 
Two large buildings at the bottom of the garden, between the luminous fountains 
and the central dome, were occupied by the city of Paris and the prefecture of the 
Seine. The sense of unity in this exhibition within an exhibition was a charming 
+ relief to the distracting wealth and variety outside. The large spirit in which the 
municipal council took up the question was sufficiently clear from the report pre- 
sented by M. G. Gaufrés (Revue pédagogique, February, 1889, p. 138). The first im- 
pulsion came mainly from M. Gréard’s memoir, L’enseignement primaire & Paris et dans 
le département de la Seine de 1867 & 1877. M. Duplan’s continuation, under the title 
Denseignement primaire public a Paris, 1877 & 1888, is a perfect mine of information on 
all possible points of school organization. The establishments represented were the 
maternal schools, the elementary primary schools; the higher primary schools, and 
the professional schools, 
In order to comply as soon as possible with the law making attendance compulsory, 
16,252 places were temporarily provided for between September 1, 1882, and April 1, 
1883, by the erection of forty-nine wooden schools. 
These were gradually replaced by ‘school groups.” These ought to contain under 
the same roof the necessary buildings for a maternal school, a boys’ and a girls’ school,

of the school battalion, a master’s room, and a reception room for the use of the head 
master. \ 
All the books, pens, pencils, etc., are supplied gratuitously to the children by the 
city; the directors send up from time to time a list of what is wanted; the amount 
demanded must not exceed 4 franes per head. In 1871 a large Magasin scolaire de la 
ville de Paris was started in the poulevard Henri IV, through the initiative of M. 
Gréard. z 
A beginning of an attempt to solve the difficult question of comparing one year 
with another was made by a table of statistics drawn up in accordance with some 
very detailed instructions. In the lowest grade of writing, spelling, and arithmetic 
the best boys obtained 55 as against the girls’ 49 per cent; in the second grade, on 
six subjects, the boys won 62 and the girls 58 per cent; in the higher grade, on eight 
subjects, the numbers were 81 and 75, respectively. 
Public libraries.—The west pavilion near the Palais des arts libéraux was almost 
entirely given up to the school. As though to emphasize the fact that education 
must be carried on throughout life we first meet with an account of the public 
libraries in Paris. There are to be ultimately eighty of them in the whole city; fifty- 
seven are at present in working order, comprising twenty at the different mairies, 
and thirty-seven in communal schools. Books and pieces of music may be taken 
home for a fortnight; in 1888, although 1,277,436 loans were made, the losses only 
came to 44 in 1,000, Besides these libraries for the general reader there are eight 
specially devoted to industrial art; of these the best known is the Bibliotheque Forney. 
To an annual income of 7,105 francs from M. Forney’s bequest the city adds 5,600 
frances. Such a collection of engravings, photographs, designs, and expensive art 
books has never before been within the reach of working men. In 1888 the eight 
libraries answered to 49,693 requests from readers. ‘The nation that teaches design 
to the ma: 
of hand,” said Diderot long ago.* 
Maternal schools.—A model of a maternal school, filled with the desks already 
described, contained specimens of the children’s work. Some exercise books showed 
that the very first elements of knowledge were judiciously given; the comic draw- 
ings in them awoke confidence in the genuine realism of the exhibits. Among the 
books displayed we noticed the first part of M. Duplan’s book; Koenig and Durand, 
“ Jeux et travaux enfantins;” Delon, “Exercises et travaux pour les enfants.” The 
127 maternal schools contain 22,879 places for children of both sexes between the    
ages of 2and7. They are entirely in the hands of women, there being 123 heads and 
307 assistants. The instruction includes the first elements of morals, knowledge of ~ 
common things, drawing, writing, and reading, exercises in language; notions of 
natural history and geography, recitations, singing, and graduated gymnastic exer- 
cises. : 
A well-arranged gymnasium near showed, besides the usual pieces of apparatus, a 
set designed by M. Pichery to develop strength by working against a coiled spring. 
Canteens.—Opposite the gymnasium was a cantine scolaire, such as can be found in 
every school group in Paris. Although the prime object of these is to improve the 
physical build of the children by supplying them with wholesome food, their value 
in securing regular attendance was an important factor in persuading the municipal 
council to vote on the proposition ot M. Hérold, then préfet of the Seine, 480,000 
francs to organize the service and to replace a number of private ‘‘ tuck shops” kept 
by the school porters. 
The children are provided beforehand with tickets with which they can buy portions 
of soup, vegetables, or meat for 5, 10, or 15 centimes. The children as.a rule bring 
their own bread. Parents who are very poor can get these tickets from the school 
committee. In 1888 12,263 portions were given away and 15,965 were paid for. The 
corresponding numbers in 1886 were 8,717 and 15,086. In both cases the tickets handed

in by the children are exactly the same. The funds are administered hy the mayor 
and the committee of the school bursary. 
Primary schools.—In the room devoted to the primary school the blackboard 
covered the whole length of one side. Thousands of exercise books with the mas- 
ters’ corrections were displayed. Some of them contained accounts of visits to in- 
teresting places; whenever words seemed to fail, a sketch or a diagram was at once 
employed, affording an indirect but powerful proof of the emphasis laid on draw- 
ing. Pen sketches are hardly desirable for beginners. 
The tasks done in the books were of two sorts, daily and monthly, and did not 
seem to be too long; above all the exercises in grammar were kept well in check. 
The attempt to find some evidences of the effects of the teaching of morals did not 
lead to any decisive result. 
A large glass case contained a school library; the number of books permitted 
to be put on the shelves reaches nearly 600, and the masters are looked after as well 
as the children. From the former were a large number of reports of pedagogic 
meetings, showing that peculiar intimacy of treatment found only among genuine 
workers. 
The gendarmes, who turned me out into the grounds several times, seemed to be

hear the 6 o’clock gun. 
struction comprises morality and civies (if I may coin. the word), reading, 
writing, the French language and the elements of its literature, geography, 
especially that of France; history down to the present time, especially that of 
France; elementary ideas on law and political economy; elementary natural sci- 
ence, physics, and mathematics; their applications to agriculture, hygienc, and 
industry; handicraft and the use of the tools employed in important trades; 
drawing, modeling, and music; gymnastics, with military exercises for the boys 
and needlework for the girls. The 191 schools for the boys contain 70,694 places; 
the 174 for the girls 60,509 places. Of the former, 17, called “infant schools,” are 
limited to the elementary course (boys from 7 to 8) and are presided over by women. 
The total number of teachers, men and women, is 3,002. 
The course of study for the higher primary schools comprises morality and civics, 
political economy, common lawand commercial law, French language and literature, 
writing, history, geography (physical, political, administrative, etc., industrial, and 
commercial), modern languages, mathematics (including plane trigonometry and 
  elementary solid geometry), bookkeeping, physics, chemistry, natural history, draw- 
ing, singing, gymnastics, and handicraft. 
Paris now possesses five of these schools—Turgot, Colbert, Lavoisier, J-B Say, 
Arago—the instruction being gratuitous and obtained by public competition. Board- 
ers (who have to pay) are taken only at the J-B Say school. The same sort of edu- 
cation is also given to the lower classes at the municipal Chaptal school. Three 
thousand seven hundred and ninety-three places are thus provided in all. 
The Sophic-Germain school accommodates 384 girls. The boys showed work in 
    books. There was an air of reality about the essays. Three marks are 
for the matter, another for the style, and the third for the “ effort.” 
The increase of handicraft, which is begun at the age of 10, apparently had had 
no bad effect on the literature. In some of the books there were very good exercises 
in etymology. Groups of allied words were collected and their meanings discussed, 
or else the force of a prefix or a suffix was amply illustrated from the ~compounds. 
Undigested scraps of derivation borrowed from: the etymological dictionary most in 
vogue were carefully avoided. 
These schools are said ta form an unbroken line with the primary school, and to 
afford an excellent preparation for those children who go afterwards to the training 
_ colleges or to art and trade schools, whereas the less clever help only to swell the 
overcrowded army of clerks.

  EDUCATIONAL CONGRESSES AT PARIS IN 1899. od: 
Needlework, the natural basis of handicraft in girls’ schools, was put on the official 
programme in 1867. The instruction is divided into three parts: The elementary stage 
takes an hour a week, and the children are taught marking and sewing, aud they 
practice the simplest stitches. In the next stage two hours a week are given to the 
practical application of these stitches in mending; the girls learn to put on a three- 
cornered patch overcast. In the last stage they make button-holes, loops, eyelet- 
holes, and do running and felling. The mending comprises square pieces overcast, 
running and felling, gussets, darning and mending stockings; cutting out and mak- 
ing up have since been added. 
Drawing.—The teaching of drawing takes precedence even of writing in the ma- 
ternal schools and runs through the whole school Syetan | till it finds its fullest 
development in the professional schools. 
At first the children learn to combine lines by means of lathes, folding and plait. 
ing paper. These are then copied on a slate and then on paper ruled in small 
squares. Easy designs drawn by the mistress on the slate are copied in the same 
way. 
In the primary elementary schools two lessons of an hour each are given till the 
children reach the upper division, when they begin model drawing from the cast 
under specially certificated teachers. The two lessons are each now of two hours 
duration. e 
In the higher primary schools all the teachers are specially certificated. The 
lower programme is extended and augmented by the addition of geometrical draw- 
ing (architecture, machinery, tinting, descriptive geometry, theory of shadows, etc.). 
So far the teaching has been general and theoretic. In 1883 two schools were opened 
for its application to the art of designing. In the Germain-Pilon schools a firm 
theoretic base is given by teaching applied mathmatics, drawing from the cast and 
the life, decorative sculpture and painting, architectural design, the history of art 
and of ornament. The final completion is found in the Bernard-Palissy school where 
four workshops are devoted to developing skill in the four main industries in the 
district—pottery, decorative painting, sculpture, and upholstery, For adults sixty- 
eight evening classes, open every day from 8 to 10, give instruction from geometrical 
drawing to sculpture. For women the city of Paris subsidizes sixteen private 
schools on condition that they receive a certain number of students who do not pay 
fees. 
Under the heading of ‘ Design and modeling” there was a fine exhibition of works 
“of art with all the French “go” in them. The Parisians seemed determined to re- 
tain their unique reputation for art taken in its widest possible sense. No less than 
sixty-eight special classes for adults have been started recently for teaching design. 
Midway between the higher primary and the apprenticeship school stands the work 
done at the-communal school in the rue Tournefort, where, in 1873, M. Salicis opened. 
the first workshop for the use of children. His system was purely pedagogic, We 
borrow some interesting details from his paper on the teaching of handicraft in the 
fourth volume of the Monographies pédagogiques. Condorcet demanded the intro- 
duction of design and handicraft into boys’ schools, as well as one woman teacher to 
every town of 1,500 inhabitants. His contemporaries nicknamed his plan of educa- 
tional reform Utopia. Nothing of much importance was done till Jules Ferry ob- 
tained, in March, 1882, a law making handicraft compulsory in primary schools; no 
money, however, was given to carry out the law. In London, recently, many mee¢- 
ings haye been held and enormous sums of money asked for, to start polytechnics; in 
all thespeeches there is never a word on the teacher. M. Ferry was more sagacious; 
at the suggestion of M. Buisson he sent M. Salicis to study handicraft in Germany 
and Scandinavia. On his return a post of general inspector of handicraft was made 
for him and he opened a special school for training teachers in the rue Louis-Thui- 
lier. In two years 72 students were sent to the various training colleges with a cer- 
tificate testifying to their capacity. Within six years handicraft was taught in more 
 
-P-A-G-E-120
  
ae 
            ODE EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
than 12,650 schools. Since 1886 the subject has its place in every time table. In the 
higher classes the children receive two lessons a week, each lasting about three 
hours. “ 
According to the official statistics Paris, in 1888, had ninety-nine workshops, with 
places for 16,562 pupils. 
Although the labors connected with the exhibition were a severe strain on a man 
more than 70 years old, M. Salicis presided over the section for technical instruction 
at the primary congress as well as over the congress for commercial education. On 
December 1 France was so unfortunate as to lose him. The brilliant fruit of his life- 
Jong devotion must have been a profound solace to his closing days. 
Since the school in the rue Tournefort is the best appointed of its kind, a few 
words on the curriculum may be of use. All the children learn design and modeling 
and they are all admitted to the workshops; in the lower classes two hours a week 
are spent in modeling and two in working on wood and iron alternately; in the 
middle classes only one hour a week is spent in the workshop; in the higher classes 
the children are at school from 8 to 6. They-are in the workshop three hours a day 
and work alternately at the bench, the lathe, and the forge, at fitting, modeling, 
molding, and carving in wood and stone. The workmen who help to teach are se- 
lected by competition and they are placed under a pedagogically trained master, 
whose duty it is to give a theoretic lesson of a quarter of an hour and to see that the 
designs are properly drawn before the children proceed to make anything. Further 
details may be found inM. Duplan’s book and in Le travail manuel & V’école dela 
rue Tournefort, by MM, Laubier and Bougeret. 
The Diderot school makes all its students work both in wood and iron during the 
first year; a choice of one or the other must then be made and the student proceeds 
to actual work, without, however, subordinating theory to practice. The exhibits 
were arranged in the form of a pyramid and aroused a wish to see what the masters 
were capable of if the students could turn out such admirable work. On January 
1, 1889, the school had 313 students. 
During the three-year course in both these schools general education receives the 
most careful attention; regular lessons are given in modern languages, mathematics, 
physics, chemistry, drawing, the history of art, ete. In the municipal school for 
chemistry and physics as applied to industry the aim is purely practical. During 
the first year the students follow a common course in mathematics, physics, and 
chemistry. 
During the second year, when they are divided into physicists and chemists, some 
time is spent every day in the laboratory in actual manipulations; during the last 
year these occupy nearly all the student's attention, the rest being given to one or 
two lectures a day. 
Nor are the girls neglected; indeed they are better off, as they have five schools, 
Domestic economy, bookkeeping, modern languages, designing, cutting out and 
making up, ironing, stay-making, feather-dressing, painting on china, are all pro- 
vided for. 
Girls with a certificate of primary instruction are admitted to a competitive en- 
trance examination between the ages of 13 and 15. The course lasts three years and 
comprises a common theoretic base, together with special training in any particular 
workshop the girls may choose to select. ‘The general education follows the lines 
of higher primary education. 
The school in the rue Fondary opens at 8:30 and closes at 5:30. An hour is given 
to dinner and half an hour to gymnastics. General education takes three and 
technical four and a half hours. The girls take a week in turn in looking after the 
housekeeping. ‘ 
Some of the apparatus for teaching the blind, the deaf, and dumb seemed rather 
out of place here. M. Grosselin’s method for teaching the deaf to speak was prac- 
tically exemplified at the Ecole modéle, of which we shall have to speak later on. The
-P-A-G-E-121
    EDUCATIONAL CONGRESSES AT PARIS IN 1889, ag 
method consists, essentially, in helping lip-reading by the hands. To tell whata 
person is saying purely by watching the lips is like deciphering very bad writing. 
The Association sténographique wnitaire, for the propagation of the Préyost-Delaunay 
method, claims twenty-six out of forty-seven reporters for the senate. The hygienic 
table shown by A. Feret, in which the desk could be raised to follow a child’s growth 
from the age of 5, seemed excellently adapted for its purpose. The change from sit- 
ting to standing is appreciated by students as well as children. 
The second room was mainly oceupied by the exhibits from several training col- 
leges. The woodwork from Auxerre and Grenoble was very elegant, while that 
from Toulouse was accompanied by the geometrical drawing from which the object 
had been made. 
The extra course in a primary school at Creil merits a special notice. Handicraft 
is taught in it under the direction of the head engineer of a branch factory in the 
workshop given to the school by the Paris firm of Geneste, Herscher & Co. 
The disease of external examinations seems to be even worse in France than in 
England, to judge by the number of publications specially designed to ‘‘ cram” stu- 
dents for some certificate. More than a hundred new journals have been started during 
the last ten years; if we had a phonograph capable of reading the detailed lessons 
alreaily made there would be no need for a living teacher! 
Die Presse is not unknown in Germany, but the examination within the school 
walls and the large weight laid on the viva voce have saved her from the alarming 
proportions assumed in France and England by the examination exploiter. 
The two normal colleges belonging to the department of the Seine, under the 
direction of M. Lenient and Mlle. Ferrand, respectively, are represented in the third 
room, although the main part of their exhibits will be found in one of the pavilions 
-of the city of Paris; these training colleges are probably the best in France. The 
men showed a programme for handicraft in all its stages and a capital set of roughly 
rigged up apparatus for science-teaching. When all our schools have workshops, 
the masters will be able to make a great many simple instruments to the obvious im- 
provement of their work in class. Another excellent idea was to make models of the 
apparatus employed in some classic experiment when it was too elaborate and com- 
plicated to be repeated before the children. The pupil mistresses had sent a large 
number of things, daintily arranged in a glass case, for imitation by very young 
children, : 
Not less interesting was the exhibit of handicraft from the town of Lille, in which 
seven schools are already provided with large and airy workshops. 
A great moral advantage over the old apprenticeship system we may reasonably 
expect from such schools. The tricks of the trade and shoddy will become increas- 
ingly impossible with an élite of workers trained on a scientific basis. 
In the Braille School for the Blind the ingenious maps and globes in which the 
outlines of the countries were marked with strips of leather and the towns with 
different sized brass-headed pins at once attracted attention. Most of them were 
due to the inventiveness of M. de la Sizeranne. Although the French do not seem 
to care for mixed schools they have at least one good one at Cempuis, where M. Ro- 
bins directs the establishment named after Prévost for orphan boys and girls. 
Training colleges.—The exhibits of the two leading training colleges at Paris, one 
for women, under Mlle. Ferrand, in the boulevard des Batignolles, and the other for — 
men, at Auteuil, under M. Lenient, were somewhat crowded together in a small 
room. Two memoirs on their history and organization, together with numerous 
photographs, lent life to the exhibits. A complete set of notes for three years of the 
student who, on entering, was twenty-eighth only out of forty and tenth finally, 
gave a good insight into method. 
An interesting album of instructive visits and vacation trips, enlivened by numer- 
cus sketches, was worthily capped by a large relief map of Mont Blanc, the fruit of 
a holiday tramp. On leaving the training college students carry away with them a 
    
             
-P-A-G-E-122
  94 : EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
set of apparatus made by themselves and sufficient for teaching elementary physics 
and natural science. 
Auteuil, with the aid of sardine and pepper boxes, etc., and such cheap anterioy 
_ sent 40 pieces. The students are taught collectively to fais chemical experiments, 
while extra time.is given them after the.lesson to try any particular experiment 
again by themselves. 
From the photographs it seemed, as is often the case in Germany, that gymnastic 
exercises were taken in linen shirts. Surely flannel is the only wear. 
In England it is considered sufficient to get the “old boys” to meet once a year to 
dine together; but the past pupils of Auteuil have formed themselves into a “ friendly 
and pedagogic society,” and a bulletin, shown by the side of M. Lenient’s notice, gave 
a clear account of the professional activity of its various members, who have taken 
high places in primary education. 
About thirty dissections and preparations with sketches for teaching zodlogy were 
alsosent. In many training colleges the teaching of this subject confused the future 
schoolmaster with a possible professor. Undue attention was given to the lower 
animals, while many subjects were treated that should belong to the intimacy of the 
laboratory. 
Although the work sent by the pupil-mistresses of the training colleges in the rue 
Batignolles was somewhat overshadowed by the exhibition from Auteuil, a careful 
examination soon made it evident that the women received as good a pedagogic 
instruction as the men. 
The notes of lessons to be given in the practicing schools were very carefully drawn 
up and excellently supplemented by the graceful objects exposed on the screens, con- 
sisting of cardboard work cut out and glued, work in paper, wool, silk, and straw; 
lathwork, modeling in wax or clay, cutting out, weaving, plaiting, etc. 
Do the students make any apparatus for teaching science? 
The number of ladies around the robes and dresses exhibited made it impossible 
for a member of “the less pedagogic sex” to obtain a view. 
The other building near the Palais des Beaux Arts contained under ‘‘ architecture” 
the plans of a school group in the rue Camon, and also of the Auteuil training col- 
lege, the Lycée Voltaire and the Ecole Arago. Two models were made of the medi- 
eal practicing school as well as of the new Sorbonne, the latter being supplemented 
by a huge plan occupying the whole of one wall. 
-Two rooms were devoted to plans of Paris at different pomais one of them ‘show- 
_ ing the 299school buildings divided among the 20 arrondissements in 1889 seemed to 
leave no room for other public edifices. 
Up to this point there had been no lack of exercise and note books due to children 
and masters alike, By theirnumber they formed the feature of the exhibition. There 
- were thousands of them, the great majority being sent by the primary schools. From 
Ciré the whole set in all three divisions of the schools from 1883 to 1888 had been 
sent. The handicraft will doubtless improve matters, but the amount written still 
seems too great; the less children have to do by artificial light the better. 
The official instructions against the admission of detached examples for show had 
been carefully carried out; the bound yolumes of the exercise books made it possible 
to trace a child’s work through all his subjects. The tasks were of two sorts, daily 
and monthly. In the latter the child is supposed to be left to his own devices, but 
the master’s direct influence was pretty plain in a good many. To see the master’s 
corrections and criticisms in red ink systematically carried out was a new feature in 
an exhibition. They ought to afford the central authorities a ready control over the 
intrusion into the school of matters fit only for the training colleges. Examiners 
in England who ask a child of 10 to define porosity are happily becoming rarer, but 
_ there is still much to be done in making the line between scholarship and teaching 
sharp and clear. 
The writing was good throughout, asarule, The upright round supersedes the

  angular formation of letters. The master writes a model on the black card, and this 4 
is copied once. The old disease of treating grammar as a thing apart from a text 
seemed still to be very common. To throw overboard the traditional Latin grammar, 
representing nothing better than the scientific level of the fourth and the eleventh 
centuries, as well as the deep vice of the Renaissance pedagogy, in which possible 
future use quite overshadowed any consideration of the child’s psychologic state, is a — 
very hard matter. Until we cease to try to put-modern isolating languages like — 
French and English into the synthetic straight jacket of Latin, and depose the subject 
taught in favor of the child as the center of education, with the consequent recog- 
nition of the skill of the teacher as superior to the erudition of the scholar, our 
progress is hardly likely to be fruitful. 
The map-drawing, as far as I saw, was bold and effective. The main object of — 
impressing the features of country on the mind was kept wellin view. Ifneatness 
and prettiness are ranked too highly the exercise becomes a drawing lesson. The 
science looked too scientific. Do we ever learn any subject in its logical sequence? — 
The first step is to win the child for the subject by linking on and expanding the 
old into the new with an endless diversity of treatment. The exercise books, how- 
ever, gave the impression of rigid adherence to a fixed programme; all the boys and 
girls of the same age seem to possess the same amount of knowledge, obtained in the © 
same way. 
Text-books—The child vs. method.—Several of the small books.on counting were so 
far subdivided as to give the exact lesson for each day. Since the fundamental 
tendency of an administrative department is to settle every detail, while modern 
science teaches us to see in differentiation the mark of advanced development, a few 
remarks on this subject may be intercalated here. Whether, as in America, a strict 
guard is kept on the method, or, as in England, the fate of the schcol depends on the 
so-called results in an attempt to achieve the impossible, the control must tend to “ 
become the dead hand, chilling enthusiasm and initiative. Surely the only solution 
is to take every possible care in the selection of the teacher and then to leave him a — 
free hand within certain loosely defined limits. How delighted children are to do. 
more than is expected of them! Shall the teacher be robbed of the same delight? To 
settle the text-book and the smallest details of method is to take the backbone out 
of the teacher. The origin of codrdinates in the school is the child, and not the 
method. 
Surely all practical improvements of permanent value come in the stress of teaching _ 
when the child is trying to explain his difficulty and his master is using all the pow- _ 
ers of his sympathetic imagination to see where the difficulty lies.. This varies from 
child to child-and constitutes a heavy strain on all the powers of the teacher, but 
then the variety is infinite and the pleasure in the gradual perfection of artistic skill 
inexhaustible. To settle everything beforehand is to lower the teacher to the cattle 
drover, who simply has to see that all his animals follow the same beaten track. 
Again, if a boy comes into a chemistry class with his face full of curiosity, not 5 
untouched with a remote hope of being able to pose the master, and says, ‘‘ Please, 
sir, in the almanac this morning, the sun rose at 8 and set at 4:21; why wasn’t 12 
o’clock exactly in the middle?” is he to be silenced for fear of not getting through 
the daily dole of chemistry, or will the teacher, considering, like the congress, a 
“general and disinterested culture” as the chief aim of his labors, take the question 
sur le vif and give his class a short lesson on astronomy, and see that his questioner 
reads up within a month the references given him to some manual, until the matter 
is quite clear? 2 
What Guizot said of the child we may apply to the teacher: Faites le fort, et laissez ; 
le libre. : 
Section III.—Sratistics. 
The fourth room was devoted to school museums, the objects being collected by 
the students of the training colleges. The subjects chosen were geology, entomol- 
ogy, and agriculture. Botany was represented by cases of artificial flowers sent by
-P-A-G-E-124
    96 EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
Mile. M. Fortier and by the firm of Hachette. This collection is officially recognized 
by the city of Paris and the minister. The few life-size models of animals, due to 
M. G. Philippon, awoke a desire to see the whole set. Chemistry was well represented 
by the Société centrale de produits chimiques. 
A remarkably complete collection, due to M. Froville, a teacher at Epinay-sur- 
Orge, attracted general attention. Besides the usual apparatus for object lessons 
there were models of prehistoric monuments, dolmens, tumuli, cromlechs, etc. 
The exhibits coming immediately from the minister of public instruction occupied 
the center room and opened out on the gallery running round the first floor of the 
palace. Four large volumes gave the Statistique de Venseignement primaire. These 
useful reports have been drawn up by M. Levasseur and the other twenty-five members 
of the statistical commission appointed in March, 1876. The first volume, published in 
1878, gave the statistics, for 1876-77; the second, in 1880, contained a valuable sum- 
mary of previous statistics, stretching over the period from 1829 to 1877; the other 
two cover five years each (1876-77, 1881-82, 1886-87) and are so timed with the 
census that the number of children to be taught can be compared with the number 
at school. The chief educational materials are supplied by the various Tspeeiers 
and the financial by the préfets. 
The fourth volume is peculiarly interesting, as all the fundamental laws except 
the one for the regulation of salaries fall within the period treated. For those who 
do not know what rich mines of information official statistics contain, alarge screen 
sent by the minister showed the progress of half a century in primary instruction in 
France and Algeria. Here are the figures:

The number of conscripts who could read and write rose in the same time from 
55.3 to 89.9 per cent; in the Department of the Seine to 97.7. 
The enormous expenditure necessary to produce these phenomenal results may be 
studied in detail in an article by M. Turlin, “ Organisation financidre et budget de 
Venseignement primaire” (Monographies pédagogiques, Vol. 1, pp. 553-613). The main 
figures are given by M. F. Buisson: ‘L’insiruction primaire en France, de 1789 a 1889,” 
to be found either in Jost’s “Annuaire de Venseignement primaire” (1889, pp. 277-295), or 
in the “Revue pédagogique” (Vol. x1v, pp. 9-22). In 1887, close on 173,000,000 francs 
were spent, of which, speaking roughly, the state contributed 85,000,000, the depart- 
ments, 18,000,000, and the communes, 17,000,000. 
Under the First Empire the amount devoted to primary education by the state was 
4,250 francs; with the Restoration this rose to 50,000 francs—at the same time the 
royal colleges received 1,775,000 francs, while the clergy had 82,000,000. By 1869 this 
had grown to 9,500,000, and by 1879 to 25,000,0000. M. Buisson estimates the total 
expenditure for 1889 at 200,800,000 francs, the share of the state being 98,000,000. 
To this must be added the amount spent on school buildings; a law proposed in 1878 
by M. Bardoux to establish a bursary for this object was unanimously accepted both 
by the Senate and the Chamber, Between June 1, 1878, and December 31, 1887, 
nearly 528,000,000 have been spent in repairing and adapting old buildings or in 
erecting new ones. The charge of extravagance in building ‘‘school palaces” was 
erushingly met in the Chamber by the minister of the interior, M. C. Floquet, on 
December 28, 1888. (Sce “Revue pédagogique,” Vol. xiv. pp..1-8.) 
As though to put the coping stone to their edifice, the government, just a fortnight 
before the educational congress began, passed the law of July 19, 1889, by which 
the relative share of expense to be borne by state, department, and commune was

settled, while the pay of the teacher was raised and he was at last freed from the 
tutelage of other professions, since his superiors very nearly all come from his own 
class.* 
For the teacher the average number of children has dropped from 45 to 40. In 
1837 the number of women engaged in primary schools was about half that of the 
men. Since 1863 a steady majority of 10,000 over the men has been maintained. 
The four sources of income, the state, the department, the commune, and school fees, 
show some instructive variations. They all reached a low point in 1867; after that 
the state rises without a single drop. The departments and communes run fairly 
parallel. In 1880 they both begin a steep decline till 1882 and then gently rise. 
The line for the school fees runs along the bottom of the diagram and suddenly 
ceases in 1881. At their decease the fees supplied about 9,000,000 in a total of 
87,000,000. 
To render the account complete the shelves contained the reports on the parlia- 
mentary debates over the new laws as well as the Bulletin administratif, which gave 
the various orders necessary to carry them out. Complementary to this, the political 
side, so to speak, of education was the admirable exhibit of the Musée pédagogique. 
Asmall deal box for the post was eloquent as to the use made of the circulating 
library. Besides the volumes of the Revue pédagogique the glasses contained a large 
number of short and readable monographs on nearly every subject connected with pri- 
mary education. There are two series, the first covered in buff and the second in 
green paper; the latter containing single studies out of the six volumes of the 
Recueil des monographies pédagogiques publiées & Voccasion de Veaposition universelle,t 
a unique conspectus of education; statistics, administration, history, method are all 
treated and treated well. What a contrast to the modest publications for the ex- 
hibitions of 1867 and 1878! M. Buisson’s Dictionnaire de pédagogie et Vinstruction pri- 
maire found a fitting place beside the official publication; it has played a large part 
in the development of sound pedagogic opinions. A commissson for Imagerie scolaire 
showed a bound volume of bons points; some of the best were shown on a screen. 
The French seem determined that every thing passing into the\child’s hands shall be 
beautiful. One sheet published by Goupil contained the portr: aits of a number of 
the leading men of a period, with an oe om on the back of the chief dates in 
sheir lives. 
Some of Fontaine’s fables were fringed with delightfully funny pictures. Around . 
the wall were ranged the plaster casts selected by a special commission for a school 
art museum. A screen gave a complete résumé of handicraft from the maternal 
schools to the training colleges, the material being collected from the exhibits of 
various establishments. 
In the same room space had been hospitably found for six societies independent 
of the state. 
Srcrron IV.—Prmary Scroors. 
This room was mainly occupied by the maternal schools. Children of toth sexes 
may enter at 2 and stay till they are 6. It almost looks at times as if, in France, the 
poor need only to take the trouble of being born and weaned; the state is willing to 
do the rest. Since, however, on an average each family in France has but one child, 
reformers will see no fault in the educational system if it tends to raise that average, 
For the school year 1886-87 there were 6,090 maternal schools, with 761,692 chil- 
dren inthem. Ofthe 9,219 mistresses the 5,996 in the public schools cost the state

4,636,863 francs. The head mi-tress must have the certificate of pedagogic aptitude, 
and to train them a normal course was added in 1882 to the training college for 
women, and then, with the wonderful French logic, the Pape-Carpentier school was 
transformed into a higher training college to form teachers for these normal courses. 
The chief part of the exhibits belonged to the private Socictd des écoles enfantines. 
The “model school” looked delightfully cosy, as well as carefully constructed on 
sound hygienic principles. As the society tries to keep the children at school till 
they are 8, the normal course for the pupil teachers is divided into three sections. 
For each of these a screen was exhibited, with a fourth for work done according to 
the fancy of the child. This was supplemented by albums giving in detail the steps 
of each occupation. Color rightly comes as the very first, with the exercises in 
position, Many of the other exhibits were protected by a red curtain from the dust 
and—the public. 
Here also were the exhibits from the national schools of Voiron and Armentitres. 
These were founded in 1882 by the state, after the model of the agricultural:school 
at Vierzon, which had been opened in 1880. Owing to their more technical nature, 
the exhibits were shown in class 5, belonging to the minister of commerce, to whom, 
with the minister of education, the schools are apportioned.* The two former are to 
contain a maternal school, a primary elementary school, and a higher primary scheol, 
through which a theoretical and technical education will be gradually given. The 
child enters at 4, and leaves at 15, either to begin work at once or to pass on into 
some establishment for secondary technical training. Manual work’in wood and 
iron naturally occupies a large ‘part of the programme. 
From Armentitres the exhibits showed what was done, whereas Yoiron seemed 
more anxious to display its method, containing, among other things, accounts writ- 
ten by the pupils of visits to large manufactories. 
Vierzon was not so agricultural as it might have been and very little was sent 
from the various champs @expérience, some of which have been in existence for ten 
years. os 
The teaching of music, too, seems to have received small attention in the exhibition; 
at least I find I have next to nothing in my notes. 
From the higher primary school at Grenoble came a remarkably fine display of 
manual work. Besides articles in wood and iron, there were others made from 
cement found in the neighborhood. Dyeing and electricity are also taught. This 
was probably the best set of juvenile work in the exhibition. 
Section V.—TRAINING COLLEGE Exumnits. 
The exhibits in the next room came mainly from thirty-two training colleges. 
They consisted of manual work in wood, clay and iron, with, of course, great at- 
tention to drawing. The power to sketch rapidly in chalk ought to be an ‘accom- 
plishment” with every teacher. Each training college has a gymnasium. 
From the higher training college at St. Cloud (see the “Training of Teachers” 
below) came a set of photographs showing the workshop and art room and a fine 
collection of busts, casts, and vases. 
The path of aray of light through a lens was made visible by means of pieces of 
strings passing through a piece of plaster. The geology of the district around the 
training college at Aix was shown by a map whose colors were repeated below on 
the boxes containing the actual specimens of the minerals, ete. There were several 
good examples of dressmaking from the professional schools, with photographs of 
the girls at work. 
A large stand of books sent by the members of the Société nationale des professeurs 
de Frangais en Angleterre consisted almost entirely of text-books prepared for Eng- 
lish examinations. 4

EDUCATIONAL CONGRESSES AT PARIS IN 1889, 39 
But what are we to say of the serried rows of manuscript sent by the masters? 
The mere enumeration of the green-backed volumes occupies twelve pages of the 
official catalogue. The departments come in alphabetical order and the monographs 
are arranged in them under the headings Training College, Higher, Elementary, 
Primary, and Maternal Schools. The head swims at the thought of the vast amount 
of patient work necesSary to bring together such a mass of detailed information. 
There is something at once sad and encouraging in the thought of the teachers of 
France in remote outlying districts as well as in the great towns carefully inyesti- 
gating the history, the geography, the scholastic condition of their district only to find 
their labors buried in some vast official receptacle; but then each man does his 
duty without thought of recognition or reward. The last shred of an ancient preju- 
dice that the French are more given to frivolity than to work vanishes before the silent 
eloquence of these volumes. Coherency is given to the various monographs by the 
skeleton framework drawn up for the masters; one of the most complete is that used 
in the Aisne department, drawn up by the Laon Geographical Society. The mere 
enumeration of the headings would occupy more than a page of this report. What 
isthe astronomical position of your commune, ete.? Does the population increase or 
ish, ete.? Is there anything peculiar in the physical constitution of the in- 
ts, their food, their longevity, character, morals, customs, games, ete.? Are 
there any Gaulish or Roman roads? Have inscriptions been found in them, ete.? 
Are the schools ecclesiastie or secular? When were they founded? How many 
pupils have they? And so on. 
The department of Marne occupied three of the glass cases. Besides a description of 
his own school each teacher contributes an article ona pedagogic question, with amap 
of the commune and various plans of the school, a table indicating the educational 
condition of the conscripts, a time-table, a description of the metheds and list of 
books used in the school.* 
A typical selection from these monographs would forman interesting fascicule for 
the Musée pédagogique. From them a small knot of devoted students might write 
a history of education such as no country as yet possesses. The advantage of going 
through a mass of material is the acquirement of a sense of proportion. Our histories 
as arule do not give any more accurate a picture than a tourist would obtain of a 
country in which he was suddenly shifted from one to another of those places he 
finds marked with a star in his Bideker. 
The exhibition from the primary schools was well rounded off by the somewhat 
luxurious display sent from the three schools at St. Denis, Ecouen, and Les Loges, 
belonging to the Legion of Honor, a society with more than 53,000 members. At 
these establishments 800 girls, the daughters of the poorer members, are boarded 
and educated gratuitously, while a small number who pay are also admitted, pro- 
vided they are relatives of members. 
Girls may enter from 9 to 11, but they must leave at 18. There are seven classes, 
each of a year’s duration, with the brevet élémentaire for sanction. All those pupils 
who pass and show aptitude haye another year in a higher course at St. Denis, 
where they work for the brevet supérieur. At Les Loges, however, those who in 
the early years show no particular aptitude for their studies are sent to the work- 
shops for needlework and linen, where they receive the education of a primary 
school, the principal aim being to “inspire in the pupils a love of their fatherland 
and. the virtues of domestic life.” The girls are taught to make their own dresses 
and to keep the household linen, while lessons are given in baking, washing, keep- 
jng of accounts, ete. There are also mattresses @arts @agrément. The class to 
which a girl belongs is denoted by the color of the sash she wears; plain for the 
lower and parti-colored in the higher course at St. Denis. 
At all the schools teaching is given in drawing, vocal music, and the piano. Extra 
time is devoted to them if after the third year a girl shows special aptitude.

The work sent to the exhibition was remarkable for finish and color. The three. 
classes for professional work at Les Loges (broderie, lingerie et confection) were each 
represented by a screen; articles of female wear from the cradle to the ball-room 
and the marriage outfit were displayed on them. The other schools sent screens, 
fans, silk tapestry, water-color drawings, embroidery, etc. i 
» The same room contained some highly colored life-sized figures of savages who 
seemed surprised at their surroundings. They had flowed over from the “ Scientific 
Missions” of the Talisman and Travyailleur. 
Section VI.—SECONDARY EDUCATION. 
An air of quiet and wealth at once marked the passage into the handsome oak 
paneled rooms* devoted to secondary education (Group II, class 7). A large number 
of books written by secondary teachers and handsomely bound was exhibited by 
the minister, but it was tantalizing to be allowed to read only the backs of them. 
A search for works on the Latin and Greek classics showed few results; indeed, to 
judge from the exhibits one would have said that secondary education had gone wholly 
over to science. A large amount of excellent school furniture and apparatus was 
shown, the chemical exhibit by the Société centrale des produits chemiques being, per- 
haps, the finest. 
_ Gymnastics were prominently represented. They seemed to be a good deal con- 
nected with shooting societies. The model gun and the ‘war toys” for children, 
shown in the Esplanade des Invalides, throw a sad shadow over the other educa- 
tional apparatus. 
Although the note-books, so numerous in the primary section, had shrunk very con- 
siderably here, the bulletin trimestriel of each pupil testified to the existence of an 
enormous amount of note-taking. Life in school was made very vivid by a large 
number of plans, models, and photographs. In one model of a dormitory the beds 
had simply a sort of screen around them, the chief amount of space being devoted 
to the passages desurveillance. A photograph showed beds with the students in them. 
The College Sainte-Barbe, which can hold 1,200 boys, was most completely repre- 
sented. The junior school at Fontenay-aux-Roses, for children from 6 to 12, must 
be a charming place. 
A model of a capital desk for two was shown by O. Andrée, of Neuilly; the boys are 
separated by a box on the form containing a large number of books for reference. 
The Ecole Monge (founded by old pupils of the Ecole polytechnique) and C. Muret 
showed excellent sets of models for teaching pure mathematics. 
Music was far better represented here than in the primary department. 
The impulse towards a reform of secondary education was given by a circular of 
J. Simon, issued on September 27, 1872, but its immediate effect was hindered by the 
state of politics.t A more fruitful period began when J. Ferry, in 1880, opened the 
high council to secondary teachers. By cutting down the amount of time spent on 
Latin exercises, by increasing the amount of instruction in French, science, and mod- 
ern languages, and by postponing the commencement of Latin, so that children from 
the primary grade could carry on their development uninterruptedly, secondary ed- 
ucation was brought into living relationship with the lower and higher grades.    
  
*May I mention here that an operation familiar to travelers, which has succeeded 
very well in the rooms devoted to primary education, failed completely in the second- 
ary, at least until I had spent three days in vain in driving about Paris to find 
some one to give me authority to open the cases. After the congresses every one 
had naturally enough gone into the country. Would it be possible to distribute 
tickets beforehand to pedagogues, the fees going to the servants?

  EDUCATIONAL CONGRESSES AT PARIS IN 1889 - 101 
To improve the school buildings and their installation, a sum of 110,866,666 frances 
66 centimes was expended under the advice of a commission of architects. 
Through M. Paul Bert parents were given complete control as to the sort of religious 
instruction given in the lycées to their children. Arrangements too were made for 
teachers to reach their maximum salary without being removed to another school. 
The creation of a republican form of education for girls falls within this period. The 
law Camille Sée was passed at the end of 1880. In 1881 the Training College at Sevres 
was founded where the new body of “ professeurs femmes ” was formed, educative tact 
rather than erudition being aimed at. In 1882 the academic council of Paris con- 
sidered a report presented by M. Gréard on the education of girls. 
In 1882 there were 5 lycées and 7 colléges (small lycées). In 1889 the numbers 
had risen to 23 and 25 respectively, with an addition of 65 complementary courses. 
The amount granted to secondary education by Parliament in 1876 was 6, aa0b 200 
francs; in 1889, 17,177,850 francs.* 
In iG “organization, methods, and apparatus of higher education” (Group H, 
Class 8), science decidedly held the first place. 
The applications of photography to astronomy were remarkable. From the ob- 
servatory of Paris came a set of stellar photographs obtained by M. Henry. The 
whole plate was covered sothick that it was impossible to place the tip of the little 
finger anywhere on it without covering up several stars. Among the numerous 
‘meteorological bodks was an atlas of the principal storms since 1863. A Jarge model, 
due to Darboux and Koenig, showed the rotation of a solid body round its center of 
mass. (See the Comptes rendus de V Académie des Sciences for July 8, 1889.) 
A board from the Ecole spéciale Architecture showed a very common arrange- 
ment in the “special” schools. The three years’ course is divided into two parallel 
sections, one for “education” and the other for “instruction.” The case containing 
the government Publications des établissements de Venscignement supérieur was 
closed, The Société d’encouragement pour l'industrie nationale sent a complete set 
ot its bulletins, commencing in 1801. The Ecole libre des sciences politiques showed 
its programmes and work of its professors and pupils. This exeellent~school de- 
signed for training men for the administrative work of the government is under the 
directorship of M. Boutmy, one of the four members of voluntary education nomi- 
nated by the President to the high council. (See the “ Controlof Education” lower.) 
The Société biblique protestante de Paris showed a stand of bibles. 
The major part of the exhibition came, of course, from the minister of education, 
and contained mainly reports from the French Cairo mission of archmology and 
other scientific expeditions, the museum of ethnography, publications of various 
provincial learned societies,t the Musée Guimet, the archives, national, depart- 
mental, communal and foreign libraries, Bureau des longitudes. From M. Liard, the 
director of higher education, came numerous publications, statistics for 1878 and 1888. 
The Chartularium Universitatis Parisiensis, edited by H. Denifle (the well-known 
student of the history of universities), first volume, has cost 11,925 francs. Under 
the Collége de France was a remarkable stand, due to M. Marey, for the graphic study 
of motion. His articles, as well as those of M. G. Demenij, whohas devoted himself 
to the scientific study of physical education, may be found in the publications of the 
Institut de France, beginning in 1887. By means of a photographic gun and photo- 
chronography applied to the study of kinematics, a model of the flight of a gull was 
obtained, the successive images being registered with astounding rapidity. 
The Ecole des hautes études, or ‘of high chimneys,” as it was jokingly called, 
when first installed near the roof of the Sorbonne, was due to the initiative of

M. Duruy, who also started the school for “ special instruction.” It is really a college 
for the ‘‘endowment of research,” and contains four classes, mathematics, natural 
science, philology and history, and religious science. Admission is liberally ex- 
tended to strangers. 
The observatories of Paris, Meudon, and the provinces, and the schools for oriental 
languages and paleography sent their publications. To the French schools at 
Rome and Athens were due the only exhibits I found bearing directly on the classics. 
In the exhibits for higher geometry the instruments were chiefly designed for the 
mechanical description of curves. 
Aremarkably fine orrery (Sphérotrope cosmographique, appareil de démonstration 
pour les études élémentaires de cosmographie, par Huguet attracted considerable 
attention. For the earth, the movements of translation and rotation, the variations 
of the seasons and of the length of day and night, solar and sidereal time, as well as 
-the precession of the equinoxes, could be demonstrated; for the moon, the phases, 
eclipses, sizygy, quadrature, libration, and tidal action; to cap all this the orbits 
of Venus and Mars were shown. 
The movement of higher education in France may be followed in the three volumes 
of statistics, each covering a period of ten years. The first, issued by V. Duruy, in 
1868, is a long list of complaints. ‘The second in 1878, under Bardoux, is very useful 
from an historical point of view; the last, signed by A. Emap, is dated May 27, 
1889.* 
The money spent on higher education in 1870 was 5,972.971 francs; in 1889 it rose 
to 14,492,595 francs, the share of the state in this sum being about 9,500,000, a strik- 
-ing contrast to the 17,000,000 for secondary and the 90,000,000 for primary. In 1875 
. the students numbered 9,963; in the year 1887-88 they had risen to 17,630, part of 
this augmentation being due to the 500 scholarships offered by the Republic. 
Among the different faculties medicine takes 8,658 students; law, 5,152; arts, 
2,358, and science, 1,335. The last two faculties did not exist in 1875. 
Out of the total of 17,630 students, Paris has 9,055, with 5,135 in medicine. 
Curiously enough the proportion of students to population is the same in France 
and Germany (1 to 2,000). 
~ Among the women there are 87 bachelitres és-lettres, but there are only 2 licen- 
ciées; 113 bachelitres ts-sciences, with 16 licenciées and 1 docteur; 1 licenciée in 
law, 1 doctor in law and 1in pharmacy. Among the 30 French women doctors 8 
are natives, 12 Russians, and 4 Americans. 
    Section VIL—TEcusicat INsrruction. 
Since teachers have never yet had any dominant political power, the school, 
instead of being based on a scientifle knowledge of child nature, has followed, and 
that usually a long time after, the main current of historic change. At the present 
moment, when the gap between the school and real life seems painfully large to 
men engaged in the actual business of the world, schemes for improvement will be 
many and manifold, and they will receive their greatest development where com- 
merce and school overlap. Here again France has taken the lead. In the Exhibi- 
tion “ technical instruction” has risen to an independent section under the control 
of the minister of commerce. Of the 118 exhibitors France supplied 112. The 
complexity and variety of modern life was mirrored in the exhibits. An adequate 
account of them all would be impossible. They were remarkable in being up to 
date. The great change in the industrial and agricultural world that has taken 
place since 1878 seemed to be presented in a small focus. Perhaps all that was

obsolete or obsolescent had been placed in the History of Work. On the morrow 
of the war considerable private efforts were made to develop what the French call 
“professional instruction.” Paris took the lead with its apprentice schools, pro- 
fessional schools for women, commercial instruction in night schools for men and 
women; Lyons, Marseilles, Bordeaux, Havre, Rouen followed suit, until official con- 
trol and management by the state was definitely settled by a decree of the 17th 
March, 1888. The ministers of education and of commerce exercise a dual control. 
Directly we rise above the simplicity of the absolutely essential the educational 
problem becomes extremely difficult. What common bond are we to find in schools 
for bookbinders, carriage-builders, engravers, lithographers, hat-makers, tailors, 
jewelers, glass-stainers, lace-makers, engineers, weavers, industrial chemists? The 
same method is followed here as in other subjects. There are three grades, each 
with a practical and a theoretical side. The primary grade comprises apprentice- 
ship and higher primary schools, the secondary the schools for arts and trades, 
while the higher grade is represented by the central school for arts and manu- 
factures. 
It would be a grave mistake to suppose, however, that the whole of the living en- 
ergy displayed springs solely from the action of the state; without any preliminary 
disputes as to the relative share of the burden due from the state, the commune or 
the private individual, each seems ready to step in whenever a real want is clearly 
seen. Of better promise still is the active interest shown in the movement by the 
actual employers of labor; they often give gratuitous lessons in the schools. Of how 
much value to the nation must this solidarity of interests be? In what way can the 
rich help the poor more effectively than by making them better workmen? What 
charity can be superior to that which tends to destroy the need for charity? 
The Paris Conservatoire des Arts et Métiers is the oldest and at the same time the 
best of the museums for technical industry. Started by a collection of machines 
and models bequeathed in 1785 to the city of Paris by Vaucanson, and largely en- 
riched during the Revolution by the books taken from suppressed institutions, the 
conservatory was properly organized in 1794 by a law due to the Abbé Grégoire. At 
present fifteen sets of public lectures are given on the application of advanced 
science to commerce and industry. One of the most interesting features of the con- 
servatory is the collection of apparatus with which experiments, afterwards classi- 
eal, were first performed. 
Being itself a permanent exhibition the conservatory sent to the Champ de Mars 
little more than copies of its plans and its publications; the success of the ‘‘History 
of Work” was, however, largely due to its assistance. Here a piquant contrast was 
afforded by the juxtaposition of the laboratory of Michel Maier, who, in 1618, at- 
tempted to popularize science with a room fitted up by M. Alvergniat with the most 
modern appliances for the study of chemistry; between them was an interesting col- 
lection of “instruments and objects once belonging to Lavoisier, the fotnder of mod- 
ern chemistry, 1743-1794.”

on the walls. 
His apparatus, clumsily cemented together, makes us turn involuntarily to the 
bright instruments of M. Alvergniat; we recognize how much the chemist owes to - 
the glass-blower. 
In a case are shown copies of Lavoisier’s books with his own manuscript correc- 
tions, and with them the monumental complete edition of his works published by 
the Imprimerie Nationale; a watch, with the dial divided into ten hours, brings home 
the love of the decimal system in the days of the Revolution. A charming sketch 
shows us Lavoisier, with two friends, absorbed in an experiment; at the back, 
Madame Lavoisier, smiling and expectant, is ready to act as scribe. Weare reminded 
of the picture of the savant and his wife in the Centenary Exhibition of French Art.

  104 EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
Besides the conservatory, France also possesses for the training of her ‘captains 
of industry,” the Ecole centrale des arts et manufactures, the Ecole des mines, the Ecole 
des ponts et chaussées, and the Institut agronomique. The national schools for arts 
and trades at Aix, Angers, ChAélons—Lille witl soon add a fourth—the schools for 
agriculture at Grignon, Grandjouan, Montpellier, and the various schools of com- 
merce are designed for training foremen. For the great mass of workers the three 
national professional schools at Vierzon, Armentiéres, and Voiron (of which we have 
already spoken) are intended to serve as types for apprenticeship schools. Even 
Algiers has one of the latter for wood and iron at Dellys. Of these the Ecole cen- 
trale was founded in 1829, and handed over to the Government by the four proprie- 
_ tors in 1857, From the fees enough extramoney has been obtained to advance nearly 
2,000,000 francs on their new buildings that cost in all over 9,000,000 francs, and to 
put aside 500,000 francs as a fund for the staff. The students from this school enjoy 
ahigh reputation both at home and abroad. The actual arrangement of the exhi- 
bition for classes 6, 7, and 8 was largely due to them. 
The school at Aix, founded originally as far back as 1780, to teach the three R’s 
while the children were working as apprentices, was reorganized in 1803, and re- 
ceived the name of Ecole Warts et métiers. Angers was added in 1811. 
A striking example of the effect of a good school on the population of a town is 
shown in the case of the Horological School at Cluses; founded in 1848, reorganized 
in 1860, and properly installed three years ago, the number engaged in watchmaking 
has risen from 670 to 4,000, with an output reckoned at 2,500,000 francs. 
The Paris Chamber of Commerce has gradually developed a special educational 
system corresponding in its grades to primary, secondary, and higher education. 
The Ecole supériewre du commerce, founded as far back as 1820, corresponds to the 
secondary grade. This was supplemented in 1863 by the Ecole de Vavenue Trudaine, 
which numbers more than 500 pupils, while the highest form of commercial study 
finds a home in the Zcole des hautes études commerciales, started in 1882. Nor is this 
all: In 1874 free courses of lectures were given to women in the various arrondisse- 
ments. Every year about 300 young girls receive a commercial education. The 
diploma given on the results of an examination is eagerly sought after, because of 
the value attached to it by Parisian business houses. 
The vast improvement in primary education has been strikingly shown by the 
cessation or transformation of various societies for the education of adults. In the 
department of the Basses-Alpes, for example, the 253 classes of 1878 had sunk to 4 in 
1888. So common was this change throughout France that no special section had 
been made for exhibits from illiterate or imperfectly educated adults. 
However, the evening classes have not fallen into disuse. The past pupils of the 
primary school come for instruction in bootmaking, tailoring, electricity, photog- 
raphy, designing, dressmaking, painting on porcelain and silk, ete. 
Societies promoting technical instruction.—T he Société pour Vinstruction élémentaire was 
founded by Carnot in 1815 during the sterile years of the Restoration; from England 
it introduced into France the method of ‘‘mutual instruction.” Later on music, 
gymnastics, geography, outline drawing, and history were added to the three R’s. 
Sunday-schools and public libraries were also started through the action of the so- 
ciety. Medals and grants of money are given to deserving teachers as well as to 
authors of good books on pedagogy. 
With the design of keeping children longer at school, and of arousing a apie of 
emulation between different schools, the society started some examinations for 
which, in 1887, more than 10,000 children entered. In 1864 certain public and free 
lectures were attended by about 100 girls over the age of 15. The numbers have 
now risen to 4,000, mainly for commercial and professional training. 
The society’s Journal @éducation populaire has been published every month since 
1815. The Association polytechnique was founded in 1830, shortly after the July rev- 
olution, by the pupils of the Ecole polytechnique, who desired to instruct their broth-- 
ers in arms. The association has had a varying Seles including a secession in
-P-A-G-E-133
  EDUCATIONAL CONGRESSES AT PARIS IN 1889, 105 
1848 on the nomination of the council, which had been limited to members of the 
Ecole polytechnique, anda fire in 1854. Now, however, its sphere of influence covers 
the whole of Paris and suburbs, and it is connected with many provincial associa- 
tions. In 1888 there were given 410 sets of lectures on all conceivable subjects. 
Plumbing and pottery are specially encouraged on the professional side. The 
forty-three large volumes sent to the exlibition contained specimens of work from 
the united classes of men and women; within the volumes devoted to each subject, 
the notes of the successive lessons were taken from the exercise books of different 
pupils. 
The Association philotechnique arose from the split mentioned above; although 
working pretty much upon the same lines as the parent society, it has always devoted 
more attention to the professional education of its client?le, and its teaching tends 
to become more and more technical. In 1888 385 sets of lectures were giyen; these 
included electricity, bookbinding, mechanics, bootmaking, photography, the work of 
employés in assurance offices, etc. The work of the association is aided’ by subven- 
tions frém the city of Paris (15,000 francs), the minister of public instruction (4, eM : 
franes), and the minister of commerce (8,000 francs), 
The youngest of these societies, the Union frangaise de la jeunesse, was born of the 
late war. Started in 1875, with a striking limitation of the age of 30 for all its ac- 
tive members. The union had at first a difficult existence; however, at the exhibi- 
tion of 1878 it obtained a bronze medal, and after that its success was assured, Al- 
though fully recognizing the importance of technical instruction, the union aims 
rather at making the workman take an interest in his work. The teacher gives lec- 
tures on the history of a particular trade, points out its artistic side, shows its con- 
nection with other trades; he strives in fact to rob that terrible line of Victor Hugo 
of its truth: ‘‘They have given the machine a soul by robbing the workman of his.” 
In some of the sections Sunday mornings are devoted to gymnastics and fencing. 
Lectures are given in political economy, hygiene, history and geography, civil law 
and literature. In thus making the workman rather than-the work the center of 
their interest, the union has made the same advance as those pedagogues who make 
the child and not the subject the center of the school. We are all men and fellow- 
countrymen before and after we are workmen. * 
Perhaps the most striking point about all these societies is, that teachers take no 
pay. To give money which we do not greatly miss is an easy form.of charity, but 
to give ourselves and the best that is in us, that is true social virtue. 
No similar society from the provinces had apparently sent any exhibits for com- 
parison with those from Paris, The Philosophical Society of Bordeaux, for instance, 
might have sent some specimens from its stone masonry and architecture classes. 
After their drawings have been finished and colored, the students show that they 
have thoroughly mastered the principles of construction by making models to Be 
in a very soft stone found in the neighborhood of Bordeaux. 
As far back as 1856 Mme. Elisa Lemonnier founded a Société de protection maternelle - 
i pour Venseignement profes- ~ 
  pour les jeunes filles, transformed in 1862 into the Socié 
sionel des femmes, which opened, in the same year, the first professional school for 
women in France; it was at thesame time purely unsectarian. Three years later Mme. 
Lemonnier died. However, the work was carried on in her spirit, and the society 
now possesses four schools to. which girls over 12 are admitted after examination. 
The course lasts over three years. The mornings are devoted to general educa- 
tion and the afternoons to work in the ateliers, where instruction is given in book- 
keeping, designing, dressmaking, wood engraving, painting on porcelain and on 
glass. The exhibits were characterized by the care taken to show the various stages 
the work passes through. The fact that in all teaching the method by which results

are obtained is more important than the results themselves is a truth pedagogues 
used continually to insist on. 
A striking feature of the exhibits from the Lyons School of Comnhares was the 
reports furnished by students who had béen sent abroad at the expense of the school. 
The Frenchman whose geographical distribution of the world consisted of “ Paris, 
the provinces, and the rest” seems to be dead. 
At another Lyons school, La Martinitre, the teaching is adapted both for com- 
merce and purely technical work. 
It was here that the “méthode Tabareau” for teaching mathematics was first 
started. Two large models of a class of 98 were shown in the exhibition of the min- 
ister of commerce. While one master is working at the black board another sits at 
the table. Each boy has a slate with his name written large at the top. When he 
has done his work he can turn this side to the master by means of a handle sticking 
out of the center of the bottom of the slate. In the boys’ school there are 650 Pups. 
In 1886 under the same management one for girls was started. 
The Rhone Society for Professional Teaching sends examples of 150 courses ‘of i in- 
- struction for adults. These were attended between the hours of 8 and 10 in the even- 
ing by 8,000 men and women. Besides specimens of work in wood and iron, modeling 
in wood and wax, bookkeeping, modern languages, cutting, and dressmaking, there 
was abundant evidence of the care bestowed on the general education of the stu- 
dents. 
Other exhibits too numerous to specify were sent from Marseilles, Bordeaux, Havre, 
Neuilly, Chélons, Aix, Angers, Cluses, Dellys, etc. Besides the general schools for 
trade, there are special establishments scattered over France for railways, carriages, 
plumbing, bookkeeping, industrial chemistry, precious metals, watchmaking, 
jewelry, weaving, bronzes, paper, hats, lithography, tailoring, carpets, etc. 
* The natural tendency of professional schools is to multiply in variety. The last 
three rooms were occupied by the exhibits from the eight schools that Paris possesses 
at present. Another, the Estienne school, for the industries connected with books, 
is on the point of being opened. 
The brilliancy of the exhibits sent by the Boulle school for upholstery makes an 
effort of the imagination necessary to believe that it’was only opened towards the 
end of 1886. Besides the handsome furniture displayed, a set of note books accom- 
panied by sketches showed how the 101 students spend their holidays. 
Although the English boy is handicapped by his weights and measures and or- 
thography (so called), he seems to get as good an elementary education as the French 
boy, except in drawing and manual work, and that general atmosphere of intelli-~ 
gence which, after all, is the best equipment for life; the specialties will come 
through the pressure of necessity. 
From such a mass of detail what general idearises up? Surely this, that the pope- 
dom of the book is a thing of the past, the appeal to things, the habit of judging 
only on the evidence immediately before us, the study of physical science delivering 
us from fear or the belief in chance. 
Srction VIII.—Tur Conrrot or EpvucaTron. 
Communes, arrondissements, and departments.—The political unit in France is the 
commune, corresponding very nearly to the English parish. In its 36,400 communes 
the Government possesses 67,300 schools, a relatively higher proportion than any 
other country. A group of communes forms an arrondissement, with a mayor and 
staff. The arrondissements form a department, with the préfet at the head; in his 
hands lies the executive and he is the channel of communication with the state. 
Each commune, arrondissement, and department has a council of its own. 
Paris.—Paris varies from the normal type, in that its twenty arrondissements are 
included in a single commune, governed by the town council of eighty members. 
These, with the addition of a few others to represent the districts not in Paris, 
 
-P-A-G-E-135
  EDUCATIONAL CONGRESSES AT PARIS IN 1889, 107 
form the council on primary education for the department of the Seine. It is in- 
structive to note that the most radical municipality in the world is precisely the 
most eager to root out ignorance from amongst its citizens. 
The control of primary education, including technical education (placed here for 
financial reasons), lies in the hands of the departmental council and evening schools, 
Since, however, the funds are raised by the communes, who add so many centimes 
per franc to the general taxation, they can within certain limits imposed by the 
law cut off the supplies and cripple the teaching. 
Since the cornerstone of national education is the compulsory and regular attend- 
ance at school of all children of proper age, we find as early as December, 1871, that 
“Jules Simon had elaborated a bill on this subject; but his leading principles did not ~ 
become law until March 28, 1882. The day after, a circular was sent by the then min- 
ister, Jules Ferry, to the préfets to set up the machinery of the new law, viz: scheol 
commissions; the examination of children educated at home; school bursaries. 
With an unerring and characteristic instinct the clerical party at once seized on the 
school commissions as the vulnerable point of the system. With the exception of 
drawing up a list of the children of the right school age the commissions have been 
a failure, in spite of the few changés introduced by the organic law of October 30, 
1886; although not legally put an end to they have practically fallen into desuetude. 
Drip brece on compulsion.—In an interesting article on the principle of com- 
pulsion M. Dreyfus-Brisac* ascribes the failure of the commissions to the hostility of 
the clergy, the confusion of administrative and judicial functions,-the smallness of 
the commune as the unit, and the lack of the electoral elements. 
Probably the chief solution is to be found. in the extracts made from the reports 
of the academy inspectors: ‘Well-managed schools are always full ;” ‘‘the value of 
the school is the value of the master; attendance is regular only with good teach- 
ers;” ‘with few exceptions absences are frequent only in poor schools; there is no 
lack of pupils in good schools.” A regular attendance then, like the absence of pun- 
_ishment, is the mark of a good teacher. ‘ 
The first examination of children educated privately was held in 1884; the sole 
duty of the “jury” was to see that some instruction had been given. Of the 2,864 
children examined, at first by writing and then orally, 2,521 were passed and 343 
rejected ; 339 did not put in an appearance; what happened to these latter we are not 
informed. 
The school bursaries, started in 1867 to help the poor and made compulsory in 
1882, have proved of greater benefit. Supported by the town, by voluntary subserip- 
tions, and in the case of poor communes by the state, great assistance in the way of 
class books, free meals, and clothing has been rendered to poor children. In the 
year 1887 the receipts for Paris amounted to 1,172,706 francs and the expenditure to 
953,596 francs, the chief items being 246,333 free portions for meals and 163,625 
frances spent in clothing and books. Money is also spent on the school battalions, 
holiday trips, gifts to the teachers, ete. 
Inspeciors.—There is a large staff of inspectors, general and ordinary, but their sole 
duty is to see that the provisions of the law have been faithfully carried out; further 
their powers do not go. 
Higher primary education, which lies somewhere between an English middle-class 
school and the modern side of a classical school secondary education of a classical 
nature, the faculties corresponding to the universities and schools of medicine in 
England, and special state education for the army, navy, etc., all come under the 
control of the seventeen academic councils into which France, including Algeria, has 
been divided, the necessary funds being derived from public sources,

under the control of the high council for Education, perhaps the most pregnant 
and weighty of M. Jules Ferry’s numerous reforms. * 
As its constitution embodies the democratic principle of representation, it will 
probably serve as a model for the organization of other professions as well as for 
that of teaching. 
Napoleon, in 1808, had placed the whole of the education of France in the hands 
of a grand master, nominated by him for life, aided by a council of thirty, ten 
appointed permanently by Napoleon and twenty by the grand master annually. 
This régime lasted practically till the sinister changes of 1850, when the state, eager 
_ to vindicate its power and to bring the direction of education into its own hands, 
swamped the teaching element in the council by representatives of the ‘ great social 
interests; ” although in 1873 an improvement was made by electing some of the 
members of the council it was not till 1879 that any real reform was made. The law 
of 1873 was due to expire on March 19, 1879; four days before, Jules Ferry brought 
in a bill, differing from the law of 1808 by the predominance of the elective element, 
. from that of 1850 by the exclusion of clergymen and of those who were considered 
‘to represent “social interests,” and from both ,by including representatives of all 
“the great establishments of public instruction and in particular of the three stages 
of education.” 
After considerable discussion and a few changes the bill became law on February 
27, 1880. The organic law of October 30, 1886, considerably increased the number 
of electors for tlie six representatives of primary education by admitting the heads 
of the higher primary schools and those assistant teachers who had been already 
elected to serve on the departmental councils. 
As far as can be seen from M, Jallifier’s article this is the only way in which the © 
rank and file of the primary teachers can bring any influence to bear on the govern- 
ment. The democratic principle being once conceded it seems almost a pity not to 
carry it to its logical limit. 
The president nominates four more to represent voluntary or private education. 
The term of office is for four years. : 
The full council of fifty-eight members meets twice a year, in July and December, 
usually for a week at atime. Matters are prepared for them by a permanent section 
of fifteen which meets as often as necessary. This fifteen is composed of the nine 
nominated by the president with six taken by the minister from the other forty- 
seven. So far no member of a lower professional rank than an agrégé has been put 
on the permanent section. 
The meetings of the council are private, but the motions and decisions in matters 
of discipline are published. 
Although strictly the council is only consultative, its real power is very great. 
The first council (1880-1884) mainly distinguished itself by drawing up new pro- 
grammes of work; the second (1884-1888), by pruning out the crowded portions— 
the number of class lessons in secondary schools was reduced to twenty in 1884; 
while the present one (1888-1892) is mainly concerned with method and the inter- 
nal government of schools. Perhaps, however, the surest mark of pedagogic wisdom. 
was the foundation of two higher training colleges, one for women at Fontenay-aux- 
Roses in 1880 and the other for men at St. Cloud in 1882.

Before the lofty ideals of the scholars of the Renascence could find an entrance 
into the school, they had to seek the protection of the political powers and were 
thus dragged down to take sides in the ugliest of all combats, the combats of relig- 
ious sects. From the pernicious principle that the school is a forcing bed for the

maintenance of the numerical strength of a sect, worked with the greatest success 
by the Jesuits, whose skill in method has masked the badness of their aim, the 
French have been the first to clear themselves. The school is not the church and 
therefore the clergyman can not be the schoolmaster. Since, however, national mor- 
ality is the salt of national life, the teaching of morals is an imperative necessity in 
primary schools. 
Although the laws of 1833 and 1850 had officially recognized that ‘primary educa- 
tion comprises instruction in morals and religion,” it came to very little more than 
a mechanical learning by heart of the catechism and the Bible. To put something 
living in the place of this was naturally a matter of prime importance to the French 
pedagogic reformers. At the exhibition of 1878 M. Buisson addressed a large num- 
ber of teachers on the best way of inculcating morals. The necessary complement, 
instruction in civic duties, was urged with stormy eloquence by P. Bert, one of the 
moving spirits in giving legal form to the new educational movement, in a speech at 
the Trocadéro in 1882, on the anniversary of the formation of public libraries in the 
department of the Seine. In spite of determined and virulent opposition the “infa- 
mous law” of March 28, 1882, was at length passed, All that was left to the clergy 
wasa whole holiday for the children on Thursdays, when, if their parents wished, 
they could receive confessional instraction. Suddenly called on to perform a deli- 
cate and important task in the face of hostile observers, the primary teacher natur- 
ally looked to his superiors for help. On June 21 a report on the proper method of 
teaching morals in training colleges was read by M. Janet to the permanent section 
of the high council with the result that a set of rules was sent out on July 27. Next 
year a circular letter was forwarded to all the primary teachers by the then minister, 
M. J. Ferry, affording a piquant contrast to a letter with a similar object sent by 
M. Guizot, half a century earlier. * 
J. Simon, H. Marion, P. Janet, Ch. Renouvier, G. Compayré, Méziéres, Liard, J. 
Steeg, Pere Laloi, M™° Coignet, H. Gréville (pseudonym of M™ Alice Durand, née 
Fleury), and a host of others wrote manuals in which at times civic and moral in- 
struction were confused to the detriment of both. ‘The manuals of M. Compayré 
had the honor of being burnt by the clergy at La Romiguitre. H. Gréville’s In- 
struction civique et morale des jeunes filles is presented by the city of Paris to all the 
girls in its communal schools. 
Received with indifference by parents, with hostility by the clergy, what fortune 
has this teaching of morals experienced, confused of set purpose as it was with party 
politics? Is it possible to’ make, as it were, an agricultural forecast of the future 
harvest? : 
In answer to questions from the minister 558 reports were sent in by academy in- 
spectors (57), primary inspectors (337), heads of training colleges (97) and teachers 
(67). 
M. Lichtenberger’s report.—These realistic ‘‘documents” have been analyzed by 
M. Lichtenberger in the fairest possible way: unfavorable reports have not been 
suppressed. The main result is held to be distinctly encouraging. ‘The morality 
of the masters has improved; they do their work better; they are franker, less ob- 
sequious, more tolerant.” ‘Lying is not so frequent: on this point all the masters 
are agreed.” Bullying, scribbling on the walls, torturing birds and animals tend to 
cease. ‘Politeness is more thought of even in the remotest parts of Brittany.” 
The mothers have been quite won over by the improvement in the children’s man- 
ners: ‘it sometimes happens that parents (mothers especially) come to congratulate 
the inspector on the habits of neatness, cleanliness, politeness, love of work, obedi- 
dence that their children have aquired at school.” ‘Can we believe,” says the head 
mistress of a training college, ‘‘that our students are happily changed enough 
from the moral point of view to exercise an influence in their turn on the souls of 
thechildren. Before any direct proof I answer ‘Yes:’ I can not think that our young

girls do not leave us better than when they came; I for my part must believe that _ 
our efforts are not useless or else my work would be no better than a mere trade; 
there would be no reason why I should take it up rather than any other. Happily 
i. “experience confirms what my instinct tells me. When we have watched the progress 
of our pupils for three years, we see them slowly changing, and on contrasting a 
student on leaying with what she was when she came, I tremble with joy as I notice 
the happy change that has come over her.” ‘I have seen lessons where a shudder 
seemed to run through the room, where, under the influence of a strong and reeipro- 
cal emotion, the alert faces and glowing eyes looked as though they wished to hasten 
on the moment of spiritual combat.” With some of the reports letters from past 
pupils had been inclosed. With a touch of dainty malice, M. Lichtenberger gives the 
following as the last of his documents: At the examination for certificates the ques- 
tion set for French composition was this, “With some of your friends you go toa 
fair; you have no money in your pocket, as your parents are poor; suddenly you find 
a purse with a 5-frane piece in it: say what you would do with it?” Of the 111 can- 
didates, 30 came from secular schools and 81 from confessional schools. Of the 30, 
there were 23 who knew that it would bea theft to take the money, the other 7 
bought toys, fairings, etc. Out of the 81 pupils from the confessional schools only 
30 knew that a thing found belongs to the person who lostit. The other 51, without 
the slightest twinge of conscience got on the whirligig, ran, jumped, and made a 
number of small purchases. One little girl took the money home to her parents, who 
kept it, ‘and this sum was very useful to them; they had three or four good meals, 
whereas if it had been returned to the one who lost it, she would probably have 
squandered it.” The above extracts give but a faint reflex of the impression left by 
M. Lichtenberger’s words. They should be read in their entirety by all who seek 
for a solution of this vexed question. Can we refuse our assent to his final words? 
“The disappearance of the confessional schools, if we think the matter over seriously, 
is good for the pupils, the masters, and for the clergy too. A broader spirit of toler- 
ance and concord animates our schools. The things that unite men. rather than 
those that divide them are brought to the front. Seated on the same benches, tanght 
by the same methods, nourished on the same ideals, the children of different religious 
bodies will make their parents forget their ancient strifes. Instead of haying two 
or three schools in the same district for the various differences of faith, we shall have 
asingle school with two or three classes to answer to the wants and talents of the 
different ages of the children. The master, freed from the teaching of religion, for 
which he has neither vocation nor training, is no longer tied down to a mechanical 
repetition, lacking both conviction and authority, of formulas that have no meaning 
for him. On the other side, the priest who has now the sole charge and thé sole 
responsibility of this teaching, brings to it more zeal, m ore time, and more care. To 
a knowledge of what the sacred formulas mean, he adds the fervour that gives them 
life and the impressiveness that makes them sink into the child’s mind. ; 
“Almost everywhere people are beginning to see the advantages that spring from 
this division of labor. The controversies, political rather than religious, aroused by 
the law of 1882, have ceased.” 
Accepted by the parents this change must be more th an welcomed by every true 
teacher, for it hands back to him the noblest part of his task. Here at least he can 
not be replaced by the book; here atleast the weight of his character, rather than 
the plenitude of his knowledge, must be recognized; here at least he has a fair 
field for all that is best in him.* 
Mr, Cunyngham’s report.—A curious and perhaps unconscious contrast is afforded 
by Mr. H. H. Cunyngham’s report to the charity commissioners on Primary and 
Technical Education in the City of Paris, written in 1887 and published in 1890. 
“No moral system has been adopted by the State, so that stoicism, epicurean-

isth, egotism, utilitarianism, and absolute morality (¢. g., that of Kant) aro all jum- 
bled together. Some of the masters teach on one ground, some on another; most 
have no system whatever.” Is it any reproach, we may ask, to astronomy to take 
the calculations of Kepler and to pass. by his discussion as to whether the earth sings 
a deep bass in the music of the spheres? May not morals be eclectic? Are we to 
take as the effect of his teaching the statement on the preceding page, ‘At their 
dinners it is charming to see them share their meal and their wine with those who 
have none. It is not too much to say that for a boy to drink his own half bottle of 
wine himself is rather the exception than the rule, and it is comical to see the way in 
which the empty dish of a boy who hasnot got a dinner ticket is filled up by spoonfuls ~ 
from the others.” Perhaps then, for practical morality, it is not so essential, after 
all, to have a “system.” 
Civic instruction.—The article by M. L. Mabilleau on.civie instruction (Monog. 
Pédag., Vol. rv, pp. 203-218) is fot based on any documents, and it is still from™M. 
Lichtenberger that we learn of the great development of patriotism which he as- 
cribes mainly to the influence of Bruno’s Francinet and Tour de France. 
“Teachers cannot treat any subject without letting their patriotic feelings over- 
flow, often very unseasonably. Such excesses they know are viewed with indul- 
gence.” 
“As far as patriotism was concerned, one master assured me it was a feeling that 
needed restraint rather than encouragement. All my pupils know, he said, that ~ 
they belong to a conquered nation, and if their feelings do not change when the 
day comes, they will know how to do their duty.” 5 
“Ts not the excellent patriotic current that we see with comfort and consolation 
tho work of the school?”

Srecrion X.—TRAINING COLLEGES. 
When Shakespeare was a boy Richard Muleaster claimed a special college for 
teachers in his ideal university; ‘‘for if the chancel have a minister, the belfry hath 
a master; and where youth is, as it is eachwhere, there must be trainers, or there 
will be worse. He that will not allow of this careful provision for such a seminary of 
masters is most unworthy either to have a good master himself, or hereafter to have 
a good one for his. Why should not teachers be well provided for, to continue their 
whole life in the school, as divines, lawyers, physicians do in their several profes- 
sions?” Yet the Germans were the first at the end of the last century to bring the 
idea into reality, and the French of to-day are the first to make it an integral part 
of education. Is not the training of teachers implicitly contained in the fruitful 
principle of compulsion? If the state compels children to learn from its servants it 
must see to it that those servants are capable: A striking proof of the pedagogic 
wisdom of France in building up men before bricks has been already given under 
the “City of Paris.” 
In all cases admission to a training college is obtained through a public com- 
‘petitive examination. The students, both men and women, are lodged and taught 
at the expense of the state. They agree to serve in the teaching profession for ten 
years; in case they leave before that time they promise to repay the cost of their 
maintenance at the training college. They are specially trained for the state exam- 
ination, which grants the diploma conferring the right to teach. This examination, 
however, is not confined to men, but is open to all who possess the necessary quali- 
fications of age, degree, etc. Although, even during the seige, J. Simon wrote to the 
mayor of Paris begging him to find the capital for two training colleges, the subject 
was not taken thoroughly in hand till the first appearance of J. Ferry as the minis- 
ter of education (February 4, 1879-November 14, 1881). The advantages accru- 
ing to teachers by Guizot’s law of 1833 were confirmed and extended to women by 
the law of August 9, 1879, which ordered all the departments to provide themselves 
within a period of four years with two training colleges, one for men and another 
for women. This law has, with the exception of a few departments, been carried 
into effect so that France now possesses 171 training colleges, all of them of course 
being secular and with gratuitous instruction. 
The higher training colleges.—Now, as these colleges are the living source of primary 
education, it is highly desirable that all the teachers in them should form the élite 
of the profession. By a development of the principle of training at present peculiar 
to France, an effort to attain this object was made by opening two higher training 
colleges, one at Fontenay-aux-Roses for women, in 1880, and the other at St. Cloud, 
in 1882, for men.*

  EDUCATIONAL CONGRESSES AT PARIS IN 1889. Lee 
A brilliant staff of professors and lecturers was obtained for the training of the 19 
women who were successful among the 30 candidates for admission; of the former 
15 have since become heads of training colleges. The whole expense is borne by the 
state; even grants of £10 a year are made for clothing and traveling expenses. The 
80 students, who, on entering, must be between the ages of 19 and 25, receive a 
common instruction in literature, psychology, morals, pedagogy, modern languages, 
and singing, and are then divided into two equal classes for arts and science. The 
number of competitors for admission averages 160 a year. The course is intended to ~ 
extend over three years, but so far, owing to the wants of the departmental colleges, 
it has been limited to two. Out of lecture time the students are, quite free and on 
Sunday they can stay out the whole day and go to what place of worship they please. 
They rise at 6 a.m. and go to bed at 9 p.m. Work at night or during the time for 
recreation is absolutely forbidden; indeed, it has to be all over by the dinner hour, 
7:30. 
The college at St. Cloud, formed in imitation of the one at Fontenay, has practically 
-the same régime; handicraft was added to it in 1883 on the suppression of the Lcole 
spéciale de travail manuel. Candidates for admission, of whom not more than twenty 
are received annually, must be between 19 and 25, and present, among other thing: 
a medical certificate stating that they are capable of standing the strain of teach- 
ing. The students are treated as men and are not put under any superintendence. 
They can take exercise in the park of St. Cloud; in the common room billiards, 
drafts, periodicals, etc., are to be found. The favorite amusement on Sunday is | 
to go to some matinée, in which the students are encouraged ; they have to be in by 
10 p.m, The Pape-Carpentier Training College at Versailles has for its object the 
preparation of head mistresses for the practicing schools, primary and maternal, 
annexed to the various training colleges for women. 
A striking proof of the extraordinary interest taken in pedagogy was the petition 
signed by 1,100 Parisian teachers that the conference in connection with’ M. Ma- 
rion’s lectures on education for the general public at the Sorbonne should be held at 
a time convenient for them to attend. At first pedagogy found shelter among the 
professors of philosophy in the faculté des lettres ; but M. Marion’s lectures in 1883 
had such a great success-that his cours complémentaire was changed into a chair of 
pedagogy (1887). At Lyons, Bordeaux, Nancy, Montpellier, Toulouse, courses of 
pedagogy were given. 
The Ecole normale supérieure in the Rue d’UlIm at Paris, for whose origin we must 
go back a century and ahalf,* provides teachers for secondary and higher education. 
The degree of licencié and the probable requirement of the agrégé are necessary to 
become a teacher in a lycée; for a professorship in a faculty to the licencié must be 
added the probability of obtaining the degree of doctor. 
Entrance for students between the ages of 18 and 24 is obtained by a competitive 
examination; for the arts sidethey must have qualified as bachelier és-lettres, and as 
bachelier és-sciences for the science side. The art students devote the whole of the 
first year to working for the licence és-lettres. Inthe second year they study litera- 
ture and history; there isno examination. For the third year five groups are made— 
history, literature, philosophy, grammar, modern languages, in any one of which 
the degree of agrégé may be obtained, and to this work the whole time is given up. 
The science students spend the first two years in working for the licence és-sciences 
mathématiques and licence és-sciences physiques, and during the third year on their 
agrégation; the natural-history students are allowed four years. 
The'time devoted to the theory and art of teaching seems to be very small. During 
their second year the students who intend to take their agrégation in history have to 
give model lessons on history and geography, and, of the two weekly conferences at 
the Sorbonne, one is especially designed for future secondary teachers.

      114 EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
The Leole normale spéciale at Cluny,* founded in 1866 by M. Duruy, is intended 
to form teachers for secondary enseignement spécial ; in addition, a very small num- 
ber of modern-language teachers are trained there. Students, who at the end of 
their second year haye obtained the certificat @aptitude, are allowed to stay 
another year to study for their agiégation, while in the case of modern languages 
they are sent abroad with a scholarship of 1,200 francs. 
The literature and modern languages sides do not thrive, while the science side is 
overcrowded. This seems to be mainly due to the entrance examination, which 
curiously enough is below the level ‘of the various diplomas the candidate must 
possess beforehand. For ten places 200 candidates, mainly primary teachers, have 
been known to present themselves. 
In 1882 a secondary Feole norinale for women was founded at Sévres, under the 
direction of M. Legouvé, with Mme Jules Fayre as head mistress. 
Both for men and women the general plan for entrance is to have written exami- 
nations at the seventeen academic centers, and to send on the successful candidates 
for an oral examination at Paris. : 
Only those students who at the end of their second year have obtained the cer- 
tificat d’aptitude are allowed to stay another year to work for their agrégation. 
In all these secondary training colleges pedagogy seems to be conipletely over- 
shadowed by the preparation fora scientifie degree; surely teaching, that is at once 
a science and an art, and that makes the most varied demands on the totality of a 
man, ought to stand higher than science, which is addressed to only one part of him. 
“Paulsen’s just remark, that we need to protect die Rechte der Lekrerbildung gegen die 
. Gelehrtenbildung ‘seems still to be as true for France as for Germany or England; 
for, according to M. Quibert, the students of the Ecole normale supérieure are par- 
celed out at the end of their third year among the lycées and teach under the di- 
rection of members of the staff for a fortnight! 
In the case of women, medical certificates are required before the written and 
again before the oral examination to certify to the physique needed to support the 
fatigues of teaching. 
Section XI.—EpucatTionaL MusEuUMs. 
Although the first attempt to found an educational museum was made in England 
as far back as 1854, the movement has not thriven. The Society of Arts handed over 
a large quantity of books, apparatus, ete., from its Centenary Exhibition to the 
Government, who lodged them at South Kensington; asso often happens in England, 
the teacher has been put aside; this time in favor of the man of science, and only a 
portion of the library is kept up to date.t 
Most of the other capitals of the world followed suit. The Paris Musée Pédagogique 
is probably the best. It was founded on May 13, 1879, by a decree of Jules Ferry, 
and was designed to contain ‘‘a museum and a central library for primary education, 
school apparatus, historical and statistical documents, and class-books, both French 
and foreign.” } 
The Musée was organized by M. F. Buisson, who had already pointed out the need ~ 
of it when he was a primary inspector. The International Exhibition of 1878 sup- 
plied alarge amount of material, which, when moved from the Bourbon Palace to 
the Rue Lhomond, was enriched by a fine collection of nearly 7,000 volumes, bought 
by the Government from M. Rapet. : 
  
*A history of the first six years of the school has been published by M. T. Roux.

  EDUCATIONAL CONGRESSES AT PARIS IN 1889. 115 
In 1885 the Musée moved into its present home in the Rue Gay-Lussac and began 
to develop rapidly. At present the library of 50,000 books occupies 16 out of the 
30 rooms. Geometry, art, gymnastics, geography, needlework, handicraft, etc., are 
all well represented, while the exhibits number close on six thousand. 
There is an excellent laboratory for the teaching of physics; in the chemistry the 
compartments are so arranged as to contain the whole set of apparatus necessary for 
teaching the leading properties of the elements. 
The organic law of October 30, 1886, brought a sudden influx of students. Nine 
hundred primary teachers applied for instruction necessary for them to obtain the 
compulsory certificate of pedagogic skill; only 225 could be accommodated. In the 
physical laboratory from 69 to 70 men and women receive every year practical instrue- 
tion in scientific manipulation. The 20 tables are so arranged that the students 
pass along in pairs under the guidance of the professors. 
-The chief part of the Musée is naturally the library. When readers have books 
from the circulating library they have only to pay for sending them back in a neat 
wooden box, of which a model was shown in the exhibition. An average of 12 copics 
of 219 standard works brings the circulating library nearly up to 3,000 volumes; 
another 1,200 must be added for the ‘‘bibliothéque récréative.” 
The 103 volumes of the catalogue have an ingenious arrangement of three hollow 
screws, passing frem cover to cover, by which single new sheets can easily be in- 
serted. It contains both a subject and authors’ catalogue, but the whole is arranged 
under one alphabetical heading. 
On my visit much of the apparatus shown was very dusty. Ought not an educa: 
tional museum to be intimately connected with a training college? 
In 1879 a commission sat at the Musée to investigate the scientific teaching in the 
various training colleges. A report was presented in 1880 to the minister, and in 
consequence thirteen typical collections, corresponding to the different branches of 
science, were deposited in the Musée. Apparatus was not sent to the various col- 
leges till it had been tested and found to correspond to the model type. A complete 
set costs 4,600 franes. A higher primary school gan be equipped for 2,400 francs. 
Repacrosts typical collections were made of designs, edible fruits, and herbariums. 
Section XIl.—OrHER EpucATIONAL AGENCIES. 
Graphic exhibit of statistics.—In the room belonging to the bureau of statistics the 
most ingenious and striking graphic methods had been employed to make the gen- 
eral condition of France, as far as it could be shown by numbers, plain and eloquent 
to the most careless visitor. 
Blocks of wood, cut in the shape of the departments and proportional in thickness 
to their populations, were pieced together (like a child’s puzzle map) and gave the 
distribution of the inhabitants of France. The rod representing Paris was so long 
that it had to be hung by the side. 
The progress of popular education was shown by the signing of the marriage 
certificate. Ten years ago 23 per cent of the men and 35 per cent of the women 
made their “mark.” The figures now are 15 and 24 per cent respectively. In the 
Vosges everybody can read and write, but in Finisterre one-half of the population 
is still illiterate. Within thirty years the number of strangers in France has trebled 
itself, standing now at 1,126,000. The Italians affect the southeast, the Spaniards 
the south (especially along the Garonne), the Germans (100,114) and the Swiss the 
east and northeast, with a tendency to spread into all the departments; the 
Belgians the north and the basin of the Seine. The English (36,134) Paris and the 
North.* The total number of French in the world is put at 45,331,000; Algeria con- 
tains 4,200,000 and the rest of Europe (France of course excepted) only 200,000.

France).

On another map the mean death rate of 23-per 1,000 was colored, while the higher 
rates were represented by gradually deepening shades of rose color and lower by 
green. The “ mortality summit” were highest on the seacoast of Brittany (40 to 60 
per 1,000) and lowest in Loire-Inférieure and Sarthe (10 to 15 per 1,000). Birthshave 
a tendency to diminish in districts where the inhabitants are well to do; on an aver- 
age French families have only one child apiece; infant mortality increases rapidly 
where the children are given to paid nurses. By forming and superposing a get of 
discs proportionate in area to the deaths, a column was obtained, broadest at the 
base (1 to 5 years). Slowly and gradually the circles narrowed into a thin waist at 
38, spreading out again gradually but more rapidly till 70 was reached, and then 
swiftly dropping down almost to a point at 75. 
In other diagrams a line down the center divided the sexes and different tints 
showed whether maids, marricd women, or widows, or bachelors, married men, or 
widowers were being represented. . 
Perhaps the best example of an apprenticeship school is the one founded in 1863 
by M.N. Chaix for the purpose of furnishing competent workers for all the branches of 
typography. In the lower branch of the service the apprentices are taught to tend 
the machines, etc., and they receive a daily wage rising from 75 centimes to 3 francs 
50 centimes; the highest branch includes type-setting, engraving, and lithography, 
and here a daily wage ranging from 50 centimes to 2 francs is paid. To encourage skill 
and good conduct monthly bonuses are given. The time to be served is four years, 
and the natural tendency of the apprentices to leave as soon as they can gain a small 
wage, but before they are properly trained workmen, has been met by keeping back 
25 per cent of the money made by the work of the apprentices; this sum, amount- 
ing usually to 500 francs, is handed over to the parents only after the full time has 
been served. = 
Compulsory thrift—An elaborate system of compulsory thrift, aided of course by 
the management, runs through the whole of the ‘‘Maison Chaix.” By paying his 
installments regulary a workman can look forward to a pension of 400 francs a year 
at the age of 55. There seems tobe nearly as much ‘professional training” in thrift 
as in printing. 
Although the pedagogue may go carefully through the 102 pages of the official 
catalogue, devoted exclusively to education and instruction, his labors are by no 
meansover. ‘Vous étes orfévre, M. Josse” may be replied, but it is no exaggeration 
to say that the school was everywhere and in everything. Perhaps the pictures 
afford the surest sign of the penetration of the school into everyday life. One 
signed “Teco” was a remarkable study of a writing class, in which the physiognomy 
of every child was different, from the ‘‘ good boy,” who wrote with ease, to the lad 
who had to move head, tongue, and hand inunison. Another by J. Geofiroy, ‘‘Com- 
ing out of school,” was a charming study of a girl looking after her little brother, 
while the Algerian section presents us with a détail intime; thé master is on the 
point of caning one of the boys on the soles of his bare feet. 
Under agriculture he will find a special subsection for method and material, the 
place of honor being taken by the magnificent display of the National Veterinary 
College at Lyons, On alife-size model of a horse slips of leather had been pinned 
to bring out the relative proportions. Some of the wax imitations of the diseases 
of animals were lifelike enough to make the gorge rise. Under ‘Insects useful 
and destructive ” was a good case of bees and butterflies exhibited by E. Deyrolle, 
4G rue du Bac. From a set of cubes representing the amounts spent by the govern- 
ment on agriculture we learn that the 112,800 francs of 1789 had risen in 1889 to 
8,329,705. 
Gymnastic apparatus.—In one of the buildings of the Economie sociale was a fine 
display of gymnastic apparatus sent by the Belgische Turnbod. A large synoptic” 
table shows what the various countries have done for physical culture. Under 
England we read: “The organization is extremely defective; the very conception of
-P-A-G-E-145
  “EDUCATIONAL CONGRESSES AT PARIS IN 1889. 117 
a regular gymnastic training does not exist. Some of the so-called higher schools 
have their games.” The writer does not seem to know of the public schools’ gym- 
nastic competition held every year by the military authorities at Aldershot. As in 
everything educational in England, no test is applied to the teachers; they are al- 
most always sergeants who have served their time in the army. 
Games will always stand first in England; they are played in the open air and 
have a keen element of delight in them that gymnastics can never rival, although 
they are absolutely necessary as a corrective for the harmonious development of the 
body. We often ste a football player whose body and legs seem to belong to differ- 
ent sized men. Gymnastics bear the same relation to games as a piece of literature 
readin class orat home <A magnificent book on La technique gymnastique, due to 
N. J. Cupérus, the’president of the Turnbod at Verslaggever, was ~ritten in Dutch 
and French. 
The enormous development in France since 1873 was shown on a large board, due 
to the Sociétés de Gymnastique de France, their newspaper organ being Le Gym- 
naste (39 rue de Lancry.) Here azain we feel the want of Germany. 
A great object lesson.—Indeed the whole exhibition might not inaptly be called a 
great object lesson of the world. In each country a bold map painted on the wall 
was supplemented underneath by a relief plan, flanked on both sides by large albums 
of photographs. Remote countries ceased to be red or yellow spots on a flat vertical 
map. To sce the land falling from the mountains to the sea, and covered by a net- 
work of routes in which the cities stand out like knots, to watch the people at work 
in the house or the field, the children in school or at play, the commonplace details 
of life in the streets, to gaze at scenes of exquisite beauty, filling one with a longing 
to visit them, all this drove home the thought that steam has knit the world together 
until our great cities are but the separate rooms in the vast house of humanity. Here, 
too, we feel as in our own home. Man lives and works in fruitful communion with 
the earth; here too, as Montesquieu puts it, each man seeks his own interest, but his 
action we find makes for the good of all. 
Perkaps the best object lesson in the exhibition was the great model of the earth 
made to a scale of the millionth by MM. Villard and Ch. Cotard. Housed in a cir- 
cular building of considerable height near the Palais des Enfants, the first view of 
the North Pole was obtained by mounting in a lift. A spiral staircase led to the 
base, where an attendant made the world move, sometimes reminding the spectator 
of those Assyrian deities whose duty it was to wind up the sun. 
The metal frame weighed 10 tons and supported 3 tons of cardboard painted in oil, 
the 586 panels being arranged along the meridian lines. Even on so large a scale 
neither the flattening at the poles nor the highest mountains could be represented, 
put the sea depths were marked by six tints of blue, the lightest denoting less than 
2,000 meters and fhe deepest more than 8,000. 
A skillful use of colored lines and pins brought into high relief the great ocean 
routes of the various nations of the world, the railway and telegraph services, the 
voyages of great discoverers, the mines for coal, copper, iron, silver, gold, diamonds, 
and petroleum. The greatest service of the globe was in giving an adequate sense 
ofthe relative proportions of the different countries. The two spots for the British 
Isles seemed at no great distance from America; the meridians were gathering close 
as they neared the Pole. Siberia seemed a large part of a belt round the world. 
We have all learned that the sea covers three-quarters of the surface ofthe globe, 
but the fact became a reality when it seemed an age while the demiourgos below 
was making the Pacific pass before our eyes; for 510 square meters of sea on the 
model therewere only 136 square meters for the earth. 
And watching, with eternal lids apart, 
Like Nature's patient sleepless Eremite, 
The moying waters at their priestlike task 
Of pure ablution round éarth's human shores.

  118 EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
The graphic method of presentation was fully honored on the walls, which con- 
tained a vast amount of that interesting information we are so quick to forget. 
England shone supreme in the shipping interest. China, with its modest 13 kilo- 
meters of railway, stood in strange contrast with the 242,000-of America. At the 
basement, on the same scale as the model, was a section showing the probable thick- 
ness of the earth’s crust, the relative height and depths of the mountains and sea, 
together with the approximate altitude of the atmosphere. 
A copy of the curious map of the world made by Martin Béhaim, of Nuremberg, 
just before the discoveries of Columbus, showed that the last three centuries have 
outstripped all antiquity in its increase of geographical knowledge. Perhaps in the 
future the spiritual discoveries of our century of the religions and literatures of the 
world will seem still more remarkable. 
Perhaps the most immediate problem before practical teachers at the uieeetad mo- 
ment is the careful connection of the various stages of teaching with one another. 
The child trained in the kindergarten finds himself suddenly pinged into a new 
and alien atmosphere when he ‘‘ goes to school.” 
In England no provision has been yet made for dovetailing ae and primary 
education, while in the latter a grave injustice is done to boys who leave at 17, as 
they receive only an unsatisfactory portion of the scheme devised for future uni- 
versity* students. i 
The impression left by the dolls was painful. They seemed to be made rather as 
models for the young ladies at a very fashionable milliner’s to work by than the 
baby’s baby, made not to be admired for its fine clothes, but to be battered to pieces 
andloved. Imagine a small boy’s disappointment at finding his sister’s doll had no 
sawdust in it. 
Over the front door of a small modest two-storied house were the words Ecole com- 
munale de gargons. Again we meet with a bewildering wealth of exhibits. If any 
school in the country contained a tithe of them the mental digestion of the children 
wvould suffer from a heavy intellectual surfeit. Would it not have been better to 
give a rigidly true copy of some rural school with the actual furniture and 
apparatus, perhaps a bit the worse for wear? Does the schoolmaster live on the 
premises, and if so what sort of furniture does he have? To know how a country 
treats its teachers is not a question of idle curiosity, and the best answer would be 
to see them ‘‘at home.” The actual sum paid as salary conveys little information 
to a foreigner. However, the beautiful drawing copies of Monrocq Brothers attract 
our attention and we brace ourselves up to a serious study of the exhibits. These 
copies are stamped in relief on white cartridge paper and range over all possible 
subjects for elementary drawing. Some of the designs were exquisitely beautiful. 
In the same corridor was a case of colored chalks sent by Vallin & Flammant; they 
are used with advantage in teaching design as well as in map-drawing on the ivorine 
slates ruled into small squares, exhibited by L. Luzanne. On the walls were some 
é capital sketches by M. Armengaud of the processes in various trades. Theso came 
from the house of Delagrave. The dainty pictures of the récompenses scolaires must 
be a potent weapon in the hands of a skillful teacher. 
A large part of the school furniture and apparatus was supplied by the Syndicat 
du matériel el du mobilier de Venseignement. The deskst were made for two each, 
with backs to the seats; the angles of the wood had been rounded off. The tops of 
  
*A peculiar difficulty in writing of foreign educational systems is the very differ- 
ent meanings applied to cognate terms. Université can not be translated into Eng- 
lish; an American graduate is an English undergraduate, while baccalauréatstands 
for something between matriculation and a B.A. . The old English universities are 
represented by académies. 
tIn the Paris schools these desks are made in five sizes: very small, for children 
whose height varies from 1 to 1.10 meters; small, from 1.11 to 1.20 meters; medium, 
from 1.21 to 1.35 meters; large, from 1.36 to 1.50 meters; very Taree, from L 51 meters 
and upwards.
-P-A-G-E-147

the desks had black square decimeters let into them; inside were boxes with letters _ 
and the figures on separate slips. In the corner was a small inary, sent by the 
minister. Fascicule No, 21 contains a list of suitable books. 
Anexcellent set of small maps, made to hang on two pegs and very clearly painted, 
was exhibited by M. Armand Colin. Each map was duplicated in outline on the back, 
and the whole series could be packed in a medium-sized box. A small cabinet— 
40,000 such are said to have been sent out by the firm of Deyrolle—contained a col- 
lection for teaching object lessons. In the school there were several good examples 
of the nécessaire métrique, comprising a rough set of the weights and measures, with 
cards showing the various money units; a 5-franc piece weighs 25 grammes and 10 
eentimes 10 grammes, ete. How many secondary schools in England are provided 
with weights and measures? My own experience is that the French use of Latin 
and Greek prefixes affords little help to.an English boy; he will not confuse a dec- 
imeter and a decameter after he has had pieces of string of those lengths given him 
and compared them practically with a meter. 
Although drawing seemed to be prominent enough in the basement, the two. 
upstair rooms, mainly occupied by Hachette, were full of copies and models; one of a 
plaster tiger in relief had the skeleton shown in the left hand corner. A glass case 
contained the Collection des principaux ouvrages pédagogiques frangais et étrangers. 
Some artistic examples of Imagerie et bons points scolaires were shown by M. Quantin. 
The renascence of geographic studies in France has not forgotten the primary 
school. There was no lack of maps, globes, atlases, ete.; they seemed at last to be 
fully alive to the fact that the child does not want to know the name of every in- 
significant town, mountain, or river in the world. The mountain ranges no longer 
look like centipedes stuck on the map; the problem, however, of bringing the rep- 
resentation of the height into the right relation with the breadth can hardly be — 
said to have been solved yet. A physical map of France by M. Levasseur. was re- 
markably fine. Outside the school under a shed sets of gymnastic apparatus were 
shown by M. Frété: A “polygymnase,” eapable of being set up in an ordinary room * 
without any fixings, was sent by M. Laisné, the inspector of gymnastics at Paris. 
If the conntry schools in France are not properly equipped, the fault certainly 
does not lie with the business houses. 
Interesting lessons were given three times a week to a class of deaf children by 
M. A. Grosselin, the founder in 1886 of the Société pour l’instruction et la protection 
des sourds-muets. To make out speech simply by the movement of the lips is like 
trying to read almost illegible writing; to lighten the strain M. Gosselin invented 
his ‘“phonomimique,” in which the hand aids the lips. 
To sum up, then, we may say that the pedagogic center of gravity in Europe has 
shifted from Germany to France. By bringing education as a whole under the con- 
trol of the State and making it an integral and independent department in the goy- 
ernment; by training the teacher and by making his promotion depend on profes- 
sional service and skill; by avoiding the iniquitous inequality of incomesas it exjsts 
in England between the head master and the assistants, and thus making life more 
possible for the rank and file of the profession; by freeing the teacher from tutelage 
and awakening in him a sense of the national importance of his task; by adopting 
the democratic principle that. the governed should choose their own representatives; 
by courageously eliminating from the school the differences of religious bodies and 
by putting therein the morality common to them all; by her readiness generously 
in showing strangers the best she has, so that education, like science, may be a gen- 
erous donor to-all without distinction of nationality, France has earned the grati- 
tude of all advanced minds in the civilized world.* > 
  
* In the Frenchman conscience is applied to intellect as well as to morals. 
The French have the greatest quickness for assimilation of new ideas and acting 
onthem. The nation is great by its mass and not by the greatness of its great men. 
The national character is far more expressed in France than in any other nation in 
Europe.

The school is the connecting link between private and public life; the parent ex- 
pects aid inmaking the child anhonest man, able to fight the battle of life, and the 
State a good citizen, is interested in the production of each, 
Profound gratitude to the French nation should be felt by enterprising spirits in 
other lands, who, saturated with the belief of Pestalozzi that the regeneration of man 
can come only from the inside, that the spiritual hegemony of the world of youth is 
passing into the hands of the teacher, are able, when their plans are stigmatized as 
Utopian, to point to them as accomplished facts in France. 
Section XTI.—Forrian Countries. 
ALGIERS. 
The magnificent wall and relief maps of Algiers at once attracted attention, and 
the promise of an important school exhibition was not belied. The principles and 
methods being absolutely the same as in France, there is little to add. Although 
some of the reports sent up by the masters contained excellent hints for teaching 
the natives, the presence in the exercise books of dictations on the out-of-the-way 
irregular verbs, on the past participles, maps of Holland, etc., showed either a lack 
of tact or the pressure of official programmes. 
The country possesses 103 schools for natives, 154 maternal and 958 primary schools; 
in the latter there are 46,109 French children, 11,819 Jews, 34,061 foreigners, and 
10,415 Mussulmans, the Jatter comprising close on 1,000 girls; practically all the 
children of school age attend. In the higher schools there are 215 natives. 
A touch of local color was given by a model of a room with a copy of the Koran on 
a low stand on the floor and by the picture of a master turning up a boy to cane him 
on the soles: 
ARGENTINE REPUBLIC. 
The control of education is very largely in the hands of the Government. Although 
the various States in the federal union are jealous of their independence, they have 
received since 1871 a subvention from the state. Up till 1870 the efforts of the Gov- 
ernment had been directed almost entirely to secondary and higher education. 
In 1881 three-fifths of the children who ought to have been in school were not there, 
The knowledge of the large arrears to be made up has resulted in a phenomenal ac- 
tivity and splendor if we can form any accurate idea of the state of affairs from the 
photographic album exhibited. The school buildings are palatial; it needs a photo- 
graph to make us believe in the reality of the Teachers’ Museum; it looks like the 
dream of some Utopian pedagogue. 
A powerful impulsion towards education was given by President Sarmiento. 
Taking to heart the belief of Horace Mann that, unless a man’s words and works 
made for the education of the people, he was not nor could he be an American states- 
man, he was the first to give subsidies to the provinces for primary education. 
He founded training colleges and popular libraries, reformed the school programmes, 
etc., with the result that in 1889 the Republic contained 3,227 schools, with 254,608 
children and 7,332 teachers, while spending close on £200,000. 
The control of primary education lies in the hands of an educational council of 
five members, with very large powers. 
Buenos Ayres with its 116 schools has naturally taken the lead in the educational 
movement, The state has made a six years’ course of education compulsory, free, 
and unsectarian. Morals and civic duties are taught, but confessional instruction 
is forbidden. Five per cent of the revenues, as well as the property of those who 
die intestate, maintain the 34 training colleges and the state schools, which now 
number close on a thousand. 
Argentine pedagogy contains a system colored by French and North American in- 
fluence on a Spanish ground, with a. streak or two of German in its composition.
-P-A-G-E-149
  EDUCATIONAL CONGRESSES AT PARIS IN 1899. 121 
The surest sign of present wisdom and future success is the great importance laia 
on the training college. The first founded is not yet thirty years old, and there are 
now in the whole Republic 34. Each province has one for men and another for 
wonien, all of them being provided with practicing schools. Of these three are re- 
stricted to train an élite for the profession while the others devote their attention 
exclusively to training the ordinary school teacher. All are provided with practicing 
schools and some kindergartens, the latter being in the hands of women teachers from 
the United States, who have introduced Froebellian methods. These training col- 
leges cost the state more than £50,000 a year. Imagine an English town of 30,000 
inhabitants with a training college of 830 students! To enter one of the sixteen insti- 
tutions for secondary education, that depend directly on the government, the child 
must have passed six years in a primary school. At the end of another period of the 
same length the student acquires the right to enter the university. ‘The same diffi- 
culty occurs here as elsewhere. Teachers in the higher branches are untrained. 
What nation will be the first to thoroughly organize the training of secondary and 
higher teachers? 
The two universities of Buenos Ayres and Cordova are entirely in the hands of 
the government. The number of students in both in 1888 was 759. 
The 169 exhibitors were all catalogued under higher education. The major part 
was of course sent by the National Council of Education, but the General Council of 
Education for the province of Buenos Ayres had also forwarded its laws, regulations, 
ete. 1 
Among the books were: M. R. Garcia, Etude sur Véducation aua Ltats-Unis; J. M. 
Garro, Biude historique sur V Université de Cordoba; J. Lopez, L’instruction publique en 
Russie et en Allemagne; J. M. Torres, Cours de pédagogie. To these we may now add:

tine, as well as Repiiblica Argentina, Educacion comun en lacapital, provincias y terrritorios 
nacionales. Ano 1888 (published in 1889). 
BELGIUM. 
Although the government had refused its support, the exhibition contained many 
things worthy of study. Here as elsewhere handicraft and industrial training-were 
to the front, coupled, of course, with an anxious care for drawing and design. The 
struggle for the commercial hegemony of the world is keen. 
Antwerp sent exhibits from its commercial institute and its school for the deaf 
and dumb. The former grants diplomas. According to a statistical table, its pupils 
afterward range from commercial travelers to consuls. 
The industrial schools in the various parts of the country give a training for almost 
every trade. Tailoring, printing, watchmaking, and lace-making at Brussels, brew- 
ing at Ghent, with a complete equipment of professors and laboratories for chem- 
istry, bacteriology, and microscopy; dyeing at Verviers, etc. 
Among the books we noticed the Revue pédagogique belge, Annales de V Université de 
Bruaelles, Histoire de la pédagogie, by E. Damseaux. 
Belgium stems to desire a solid and practical training for its inhabitants without 
laying any great stress on the formation of an universal artistic taste. 
How far is the reactionary party in Belgium ERODE Le for the poverty of the 
exhibits? * 
The question of trade-training in Belgium was fully treated in a report due to M. 
Bouvy, of Ligge. Although a large number of apprenticeship schools for weaving 
were opened in 1842 in the leading manufacturing towns they did not thrive, and

since 1857 no new one has been started. Now it is proposed to reorganize them 
with a programme somewhat less developed than that of ie ordinary ‘professional 
schools. 
At Tournay the municipality has organized a professional school on a peculiar 
plan. The workshops for wood, with machinery of various kinds, are let out to con- 
tractors, who haye to supply material, lighting, tools, and salaries, while they make 
~ what profit they can. In the contracts the number of apprentices to be employed, the 
wages, and the length of the working day are all specified. The contractor receives 
1,500 franes a year, with 500 franes for tools, ete. The apprentices are bound for five 
years. For the first year they receive no pay, afterwards for a day of 8} hours the pay 
rises every quarter, starting at 10 centimes and touching finally 1 franc 50 centimes. 
At Brussels, in 1880, the master tailors started a school to compete with the houses 
for ready-made garments and to improve the work done by hand. The school con- 
tains four classes with eight pupils in each; they are supposed to serve for four 
years. Atthe beginning of the second year a wage of 2 francs a-week is paid; 
bonuses that can be claimed only on the completion of the full time have reduced 
the number of premature defections to 10 per cent. Twice a week lessons are given 
on morals, French, history, geography, linear drawing, and beokkeeping. Suffi- 
cient tailoring work, paid for at the prices current in the best houses, is supplie 
by the committee of management. 
A. Delattre (Mons) exhibited a fine model of the brain, with the centers denoted 
by little brass rods leading to the side, with the name. Aquedue de Silvius was 
shown done in two portions. 
There is training for the teachers of manual work at the Ecole Normale de Etat 
pour Instituteurs Primaires 4 Mons, Great weight is attached to designing. 
DENMARK. 
On entering the Danish court the eye was immediately caught by a large number 
of visiting cards, Hardly any of the objects exhibited had failed to find a purchaser 
from some part or other of the world. Certainly the exquisite taste displayed in the 
application of art to industry deserved this eloquent token of success. The furni- 
ture, jewelry, pottery, terra cotta and iron work showed a rare combination of 
wealth and elegance. 
The technical school for women, founded at Copenhagen. in 1875, must count for 
something in this success. The other exhibits were too scanty to allow of the for- 
mation of any adequate idea of the present state of education in Denmark. 
A fine map by Petersen was sent bythe publisher, Herr Ronn, but the good effect 
was rather spoilt by the juxtaposition of some highly colored and theatrical scenes 
from history. Those who have visited Copenhagen know how rich the museums aru 
in material for the study of ethnography, but the stone, bronze, and iron implements, 
together with the conjectural life-size representation of a family in the bronze age 
were shown in the history of work in the palace of the liberal arts. 
For the teacher the most interesting exhibit was an album designed by Herr Mik- 
kelsen.* Denmark has been the last of the Scandinavian countries to actept the im-

it is optional in Sweden. 
The special feature of Herr Mikkelsen’s method is that he attempts to teach hand- 
icraft to a class running up to forty boys. A model is shown and explained, the di- 
mensions given, and a rough copy made of a drawing of the model. Boys.that finish

early are given a“ parallel number,” which affords a slightly more difficult exercise. 
Great emphasis is laid on the correct use of the tools, beginning with the saw, the 
American saw, and the knife, etc. For their proper use a special set of ‘“applica- 
tion exercises” have been drawn up. Care is taken that the exercises shall keep the 
child in an attitude physiologically correct... Wood alone is employed. Herr Mik- 
kelsen likes Vielsléjderei as little as Herr Salomon. 
In our present condition of affairs, the attempt, however unpromising it may ap- 
pear at first sight, to teach handicraft in class must enlist our sympathies. .A long 
account of his system was given by Herr Mikkelsen* in 1888 to a conference at Mu- 
nich. It leaves the impression of being rather a preparatory school for future car- 
penters than an integral part of education. 
From a note on the training colleges (Rev. pédag., xiv, p. 240) we learn that 
Denmark possesses four of them, all for men. Three-fourths of the directors are 
clergy. The curriculum contains neither modern languages nor handicraft, and the 
pedagogy is limited to four hours a week in the student’s third year. Asin England 
they are rather continuation schools than training colleges. 
ENGLAND AND SPAIN. 
To pass from the French exhibits, so full of suggestions, so eloquent of the sacri- 
fices cheerfully made for the cause of education, into the two rooms allotted-to 
Spain and England was a melancholy and painful anticlimax. From the former 
came a case of books, chiefly the publications of learned societies. A Historia de las 
Universidades en Espana by La Fuente, caught my attention. This, perhaps, is not to 
be wondered at when we learn that out of 15,921 schoolmasters only 2,213 receive more 
than 825 franes a year. (See in the Revue internationale, Vol. xv, pp. 53-72, an arti- 
cle by M. M. Harbulot on L’enseignement public en Espagne @apres des documents officiels.) 
In the latter education seemed to have resulted mainly in a fine set of platinotypes. 
Eighteen English publishers were represented by Galignani, but their hooks were 
of general interest, ies 
The sobriety and sincerity of English art, the combination of elegance and rich- 
ness, came out clearly. zs 
The industrial exhibits were powerless to obliterate the memory of our culpable 
apathy. Surely among the 380,000 Englishmen who visited Paris some few would 
have been interested in a conspectus of English education. With what results have 
we listened to Matthew Arnold’s incessant cry of ‘‘ Organize your secondary educa- 
tion?” How much lost ground have we made up in the matter of primary educa- 
tion? May we be justly proud of our girls’ schools? 5 
In a country where the confusion between the separate offices of the teacher, the 
clergyman, the scholar, and the man of science is complete and almost universal it 
is perhaps somewhat early to look for that generally diffused pedagogic sense, the 
first requisite for a fruitful organization of education. Unwilling to believe that 
English education was wholly unrepresented, I commenced to hunt in other parts of 
the exhibition, with the result that I found in the anthropological section, “Cata- 
logue of ethnological exhibits prepared for the Paris Exposition of 1889, but not ex- ~ 
hibited owing to the orders of the secretary of state for India.” Perhaps it will be 
best to follow the organizing committee and to leave such a statement in its naked 
eloquence. At last, however, right away, at the other end of the grounds, in the 
Economie sociale, 82 annual reports of the British and Foreign School Society were 
discovered with the Ancient Order of Foresters, while plans of the London sewers 
and Holborn Viaduct were mixed up with some specimens of wood work from the 
London school board. Surely something more than this, and an annual report, could 
have been obtained purely by volunteer efforts from their 400 schools. Eeonomy is

Robin’s excellent book on Technical School and College Building; photographs of 
the Sanatorium of King Edward VI School at Sherborne; of the Merchant Venturers’ 
School at Bristol; Reports of the Society for Prevention of Blindness, Highgate; of

Birmingham, built to accommodate 1,080 children; plans of the Blackburn Tech- 
nical School, and of the Liverpool School for Cookery, and finally an account of the 
Ladies’ College at Cheltenham, 
FINLAND. 
We enter the Finnish pavilion with considerable curiosity. The student of English 
knows that he has to seek for the most primitive, we might almost say the fossil 
forms of his native language, in the large number of words borrowed by the Finns 
about the beginning of our present era from the neighboring tribes of the primitive 
Germanic nation; to the student of philology the epic of Kalewala is interesting in 
its attempt to account for the origin of language, while the educationalist honors 
Finland as the home of the movement for handicraft in schools. 
We seem to be taken back to the times of the Renascence scholars when we learn 
that Un Cygnaeus (1810-1888) is a Latinized form of the Finnish Joutseno; like a 
true disciple of Pestalozzi, his bent toward education came from a profound sym- 
pathy with the life of the poor. In 1856 the Czar Alexander visited his duchy and 
_ promised the Finns a reform of their school system. Cygnaeus published his Strédda 
Taukar and laid down the main lines on which the proclamation of 1858 was based. 
Handicraft in the school and the proper training of teachers, both men and women, 
are its essential points. Cygnaeus was sent ona long pedagogic tour, but apparently 
he did not think it worth while to visit France or England. He returned to Finland 
with a clear conception of the fundamental difference between working for a trade 
and handicraft as a means of formal education. In 1863 the first seminary (or train- 
ing.college) was opened at Jyvdskyldc. On May 11, 1866, the organization now in force 
was definitely settled. Since then primaries have been founded at Ekeniis, Nykarleby 
and Sordayala. All four were represented at the exhibition, apd with some thirty 
“folkschools,” fer which they train the teachers, gave an adequate picture of pri- 
mary-education in Finland. 
Although the girls’ work from many of the schools was evidently intended for 
“Sunday best,” the one at Abo was not afraid of sending specimens of stockings, 
shirts, and jersies, meant for rough, every-day wear. Many of the exhibits had cards 
stating the age and time at school of the pupils. - 
As in France, handicraft is practiced both in wood and metal. The boys spend five 
or six hours a week on it with a purely pedagogic aim. An accurate eye and a dex- 
terous hand are enough to demand from the first stage in education. The metal 
work from the four seminaries was in copper, iron, and steel, comprising a large num- 
“ber of different tools. 
The objects in wood are made from a hard birch and consist mainly of household 
utensils. 
To judge by the number of exhibits calligraphy and shorthand are highly honored 
in Finland. : Higher education was mainly represented by the transactions of a large 
number of learned societies. The studies from the School of Art at Helsingfors were 
frankly realistic, being taken almost entirely from the everyday life of the poorer 
classes. The Central School for Art applied to Industry was founded in 1870, and is 
supported by private donations. 
GUATEMALA. 
Although Guatemala does not yet seem, like the South American States, to have 
taken the first step forward in education by freeing it from the control of the clergy,
-P-A-G-E-153

some good results may be expected from the appointment, by a decree of 1887, of a 
director for primary education in each of the departments. Among other things it 
is his duty to visit once a month all the schools, public and private, in his district; 
on the 1st of December in each year he has to meet his fellow directors in the capi- 
tal. These constitute ‘(a general council of popular instruction.” 
HOLLAND. 
The most important exhibits came from Amsterdam. The Institute for Blind Chil- 
dren under the direction of J. H. Meyer sent a number of English, French, igual 
and Dutch books beautifully printed. 
The weight laid on art is fully shown by the exhibits from the Normal School for 
Drawing at Amsterdam and from the Museum and Professional School for Industrial 
Art at Haarlem; the latter is specially designed to train students in architecture, 
sculpture, painting, engraving and art needlework. The Haarlem school was 
founded in 1883; it is interesting to note how rapidly and surely institutions grow 
when they correspond to some real need. 
The ‘Professional School for Trades” at Leyden sent work in wood and iron and 
models of houses, From the same town came the only Dutch exhibit for primary 
education. The normal school, under Mlle. Hardenberg, trains mistresses for the 
one hundred maternal schools of Holland and the Dutch Indies. To judge from the 
photographs of the building and the monthly journal edited by the directress, an 
earnest endeavor is made to keep the pedagogic treatment of the very first stages of 
school life on a high level. Some of the articles made by the students seemed a lit- 
tle lacking in artistic finish. The sole exhibit for secondary education, the wooden 
models of the mathematical solids, by I. Noest, of Leyden, wore a forlorn and soli- 
tary air. 
The hatural tendency of Protestantism to break up into sects is forcibly illus 
trated by the religious history of Holland. The sects had become so numerous that a. 
pastor at the end of the eighteenth century suggested the formation of a “neutral: 
school.” In 1806 ‘‘neutrality” became the law in Holland, the first country in Eu- 
rope to adopt what the French now call “la laicité de Venseignement.” The logical 
base of compulsion and gratuity, however, has never been accepted by Holland, and 
eyen the neutrality has been swept away by the law of December 6, 1889.* Since, 
however, this retrograde movement is due to an unnatural coalition of Protestants 
and Ultramontanes, it is probably only transitory. Happening to be at Antwerp 
when the same movement had begun to carry the Belgian elections, I was very much 
struck with the huge numbers of placards, pamphlets, and books displayed by the 
Liberal party. I spent a whole day visiting the various booksellers trying in vain 
to get from the other side some expression of opinion, some justification for the 
coming changes. The children of light seem at times to develop a great fondness for 
working in the dark. 
JAPAN, 
On entering the Japanese court the eye was at once caught by a large sheet covered 
with the characters, eloquent to the phonetically-trained student, of A. M. Bell’s 
“visible speech.” The fifty sounds in Japanese were represented in this alphabet 
for the use'of the deaf-mutes. 
The enlightened direction given by the Government to education was obvious from 
the-exhibits of the minister; in 1887 close on 3,106,000 franes were spent. The Ja- 
pan Musée pédagogique receives a large subvention; all apparatus, etc., designed for 
school use is first tested there. An account of the museum is published by the de 
partment of education, as wellas a ee book on the ‘Outlines of the Modern Edu- 
cation in Japan.”

The publications sent by the students showed a high standard of work. The lan- 
guages in which they were written—English, French, and German—were remarkably 
correct; occasionally, however, the strange use of a preposition betrayed the foreign 
hand. 
Among the “instructive toys” to be used in primary education were some droll 
dolls, made of paper, with painted faces. 
Books, music, commercial correspondence, and models were the leading exhibits in 
secondary, while for higher education there was shown a collection of laws, pho- 
tographs, transactions, and documents on seismology; the latter called to mind the 
remarkable model at the South Kensington Museum, made»by a Japanese to repre- 
sent the path of a particle during an earthquake. In 1882 two educational societies 
amalgamated under the name of the Dai-nihon Kyéiku Kwai, at 21 Hitotsubashi- 
Toricho, Kanda-Ku, Tokyo. In 1884 the Prince Imperial was made president and the 
number of members rose to 5,000. Seven sections keep watch over the whole edu- 
cation of the country in all its grades. The society publishes a journal.* 
MEXICOe 
No'report of the Mexican exhibit. 
NORWAY. 
Two exhibitors in classes 7 and 8 and one in class 6 represented the pedagogy of 
Norway. The method for teaching drawing published by A. Petersen, of Christiania, 
and used in the primary schools, as well as the zodlogical diagrams of P. Dybdhal, 
of Trondhjem merited better support. Great changes in the “common schools” 
' were introduced by a law passed in June, 1889, by the Liberal party in the face of 
strong opposition from the Conservyatives.t 
PARAGUAY. 
Although in 1824 Alexander von Humboldt stated that all the inhabitants of Par- 
-aguay could read and write, the exhibition contained nothing specially educational. 
Attendance at school was made compulsory in 1861, and a ‘‘supreme law of edu- 
cation” was passed in 1887. Ten per cent of the money realized by the sale of pub- 
lic lands anéforests, the property of those who die intestate, 12 per cent-on public 
auctions, fines, and a poll tax of a piaster on every man, supply the funds for edu- 
cation; 800,000 piasters were spent in 1887. The 138 public primary schools give 
instruction to 15,000 scholars. 
RUSSIA. 
_ In the official catalogue there are only eight entries for Russia, and of these the 
exhibition of books sent by Mme. Altscheysky from the Sunday school at Kharkoff 
was alone of any importance. 
Although under Catherine II primary schools were opened in St. Petersburg in 
1781, and a training college’ was active from 1786 to 1801, education has remained - 
the privilege of the rich for the greater part of this century. 
In the sixties, after the liberation of the serfs (February 19, 1861), a widespread 
moyement for the better education of the poor passed through Russian society. 
Schools were opened and courses of instruction for adults started. However, the 
Government became alarmed and the work was stopped by closing the private schools. 
Mme. Altschevsky alone weathered the storm. Here a voluntary staff of 60 women 
teachers give elementary instruction to between 300 and 400 people, varying in age 
from 10 to 45. The school is open every Sunday for nine months in the year. The

chief instrument of culture is the reader, ‘‘ What shall we give the poor to read?” 
The answer given by the novelist Tolstoi, and the society founded by him, the Inter- 
mediary (i. e., between the rich and the poor), was a series of tales with a moral and 
religious tendency, written with a “goody” aim. The usual sterility due to the 
efforts of one class of society to play providence to another without any adequate 
knowledge of its wants followed until Mr. Sytine, a rich Moscow publisher of pop- 
ular books, hit on a happy trick. The Russian peasant, instead of welcoming the 
new reading offered him, maintained a steady demand for a few old favorites, mainly 
travestied translations of the immoral parts of foreign books. Retaining the old | 
titles, Mr. Sytine gradually changed the contents. . Of this transformed literature 
what was most in demand, the moral stories written ad hoc or the literature, native 
and foreign, gradually added to the series?’ The answer obtained by Mme. Altche- 
vsky by a direct appeal to experiment is important. She read King Lear to her 
scholars in three different forms. Over the first they yawned. It was a prose trans- 
lation interspersed with moral reflections. Next the story transplanted into Rus- 
sian peasant life, The old man Nikita and his three daughters, became a favorite of the 
lending library. Finally a faithful verse translation was given and understood from 
end to end. 
“Nobody missed the subtility and bitterness of the fool’s gibes. The lamentations 
of King Lear in the storm were accompanied by half-checked sobs, and when the 
reading was done a heavy silence hung for several minutes over the listeners.” 
In 1889 a remarkable volume was published by Mme. Altscheysky and her fellow- 
workers. It contains a faithful transcript of the remarks made by the illiterate au- 
dience, to whom some 2,500 works were read.* 
= SAN SALVADOR. 
Although the smallest of the Republics of Central America, the inhabitants of 
- San Salvador are better off and number more to the square kilometer than their 
neighbors. 
In 1886 thero were 602 schools educating 14,000 boys and 6,000 girls; the number, 
of children who ought to be at school is 62,000. As in Chile, the Government offers 
prizes for works on education. In 1883 Signor Galondo’s “Elements of Pedagogy” 
was adjudged the prize. 
SPAIN.

SWITZERLAND. 
Switzerland was one of the few countries officially represented at the Exhibition. 
Although political considerations perhaps made the Confederation accept the 
French invitation at once in 1887, a shrewd sense of the industrial importance of 
the Exhibition was not lacking. , 
Liberally aided by the Government, the cantons, and the leading towns, private 
enterprise was enabled to display its productions to the best advantage, and per- 
haps show a better front in the redoubtable competition with England aud America 
in the silk, cotton, and watch industries. 
After France, Switzerland was the most completely represented in the Exhibition. 
Its products were everywhere. Pedagogy, was lodged in the Groupes divers étrangers, 
and consisted mainly of a fairly complete exhibition of primary and ee 
instruction. 
Although four rooms had been acquired by the Swiss through an early bdlicidne 
the space was inadequate, the first room especially being overcrowded and badly

lighted. A sarge book was ready for the signature ef Swiss visitors, while a board 
gave the names of places where they might find one another in the evening. 
In many of the cantons a quarter of the whole budget is devoted to education, the 
greater part of the money falling to gratuitous and compulsory primary schools. 
This serious, solid interest was reflected in the exhibition; it was possible to ob- 
tain a fairly complete conspectus of primary and professional instruction; native 
critics ascribe to the latter much of the well-known Swiss skill in the various in- 
dustries. 
The Pedagogic Museum at Ziirich sent busts of Pestalozzi, Fellenberg, and Girard, 
and a number of photographs of leading educationalists. 
An apparatus for teaching fractions was exhibited by F. Maillard.* Two uprights 
are connected by sets of parallel wire rods, one lying above and behind the other; 
pieces of wood painted black on one side and white on the other, and each, a cer- 
tain fraction of the whole distance between the uprights, can slide along the rods, 
the white side being shown by turning the piece over till it rests on the upper rod. 
Geneva may well be proud of its art school; the work sent is as remarkable in 
variety as in taste, and included Formvollendung, modeling, Kunstguss, Stanzarbeit 
und Ciselirung, Fayencen, Mosaiken und Wandmalereien. The students have made 
a remarkable chimney piece in the Renascenceé style for the Bundespalast at Bern. 
Although lacking the brilliancy of the Geneva school, the Technikum of Winterthur 
provides a solid and useful training in architecture and designing. The art and 
needlework school at Ziirich sends some good sewing work and many elegant de- 
signs for monograms. 
From the exhibition of the Ziirich publishers, Orell Fiissli & Co., we pick out 
the Sammlung neuer Gesetze und Verordnungen, by C. Grob, the secretary of ¢he edu-- 
cational department. To him are also due the statistical facts embodied in a large 
atlas by R. Hinder. The town of Basel spends the most on its schools; the num- 
~ per of children per teacher ranges from 31 to 82. 
-.A model exhibited by Prof. Aeby, of Bern, at the first glance looked as though a 
kitten had been allowed to play with red and blue balls of twine; however, the 
model turned out to be a “phantom” of the brain and spinal marrow. The sensor 
and motor nerves were denoted by red and blue wires, and the ganglia by small 
knobs. An interesting contrast was afforded by another model in the Belgium 
section, due to A. Delattre, of Mons. A vertical section of the head was made and 
the two halves turned outwards, right and left; at the sides were small bone plates, 
each with the name of some part of the brain; a thin brass wire fixed in the plate 
and ending in a flattened tongue ran to the part named. 
Admirable desks were shown by A. Mauchain, Gendve. 
Throughout there was in the space devoted to Switzerland a large amount of 
material for teaching. 
A tourist can not be long in Switzerland without being struck by the beauty and 
accuracy of the native maps. The variety and complexity of the surface of the 
country makes cartographical skill a necessity. 
Although Switzerland possesses 544 kindergartens, in which 611 women teachers 
look after 20,014 young children, only Geneva and St. Gall sent exhibits. If wemay 
judge of the life in their infant schools from an album of photographs, the meaning 
of the word kindergarten is still conscious of its second half. The gradual rise and 
development of the objects sent by St. Gall was made amply clear; they were worked 
out quite in the spirit of Froebel. Geneva seemed to have yielded somewhat to the 
ever present tendency of intruding the higher branches of education on the lower; 
the children are received at the age of 3 and kept till they are 6, when their work 
bears the stamp of a preparatory school rather than of a kindergarten. The diffi- 
culty of coupling schools is doubtless great, but the necessary adjustments must not

“Our agriculture and our industries,” said Fellenberg, “must draw their chief 
support from the primary schools.” His influence on them is reflected in the atten- 
tion paid to handicraft. The visitor could not but notice that the care and bright- 
ness with which the first elements of science and the natural history of the country : 
are made to attract the eye. Illustrated primers, maps, collections of the fauna and 
flora, make a knowledge of the country easy and attractive. The attention paid to 
handicraft may be inferred from the exhibits sent from Hofwyl and Basel, 
Austria has recently devoted great attention to school gardens; without counting 
Hungary, she has at present close on 8,009 of them connected with public or private 
schools; practical instruction is given in growing vegetables and fruit trees and in 
rearing bees, These schools were visited recently by Herr Zollinger and the result: 
of his mission were embodied in a fine atlas. There was a school garden running 
round the back of the panorama Tout-Paris, near the Ecole modéle, and containing 
maize, grasses, fruit trees, and a kitchen garden; it did not look very gay. ay 
A magnificent set of photographs by R. Guter, of Zurich, was lodged without noes : 
apparent propriety in the agricultural section on the Quai d’Orsay. 
Switzerland used to be famous for its needlework, and the beauty of the hiatoen 
specimens exhibited made one almost regret the invention of the sewing machine. 
It has, however, been pressed into good service by inherited artistic skill. ae was 
effectively employed in many of the fancy articles. ; 
Superior education in Switzerland is connected with the universities of Basel, 
Geneva, Bern, and Zurich. There is also a polytechnic at Zurich, 
  TUNIS. 
  The remarkable development of education in Tunis since rp catebliehed her 
protectorate shows clearly that so’ far as the official action of the government i 
concerned, the missionary has heen replaced by the schoolmaster. In 1883 there were 
150 natives studying French; in two years the number had risen to 474; but in 1889 
it touched 1,765. ‘The schools rose from 24, in 1883, to 67, in 1889, with 9,494 pupils. 
Outside Tani 28 other places are provided with schools. 3 
A chair for Arabic was founded in 1884. The students, mainly manne officialas 
numbered 120 in the year 1888-89. 
Formerly instruction was given in the great Mosque, and consisted almost entirely 
in learning the Koran by rote. The higher students, desirous of entering public 
service, did some grammer, law, logic, and literature, and occasionally arithmetic, — 
geography, and history. ¢ - t 
There were several cases of work sent by pupils and teachers. The chief part of 
the exhibition was sent by the 100 students of the training college at Alaoui. Inthe 
practicing school attached there are 200 children. 
  UNITED STATES, - + y 
A foreigner who, after seeking in vain for anything educational from England, 
came to the conclusion that the English-speaking races cared nothing for pedagogy, 
would hardly be likely to change his opinion even after seeing the American display. 
Here, too, he would haye been curious to know why photography was so much honored. 
Aldiough Congress voted 1,250,000 francs and thirty-eight States appointed commis- — 
sioners with Gen. ‘franklin as their head; although 1,500 exhibitors had a space of — 
8,000 square meters allotted to them, the paaaen of Rens in the official catalogue 
under ‘education ” amounted to no more than 17, This was hardly a generousreturn — 
for the fine display made by France at th® New Orleans Exhibition, which, as Dr. 
Harris said, ‘‘ was worth a journey from any part of the United States.” Canine 
to the Desaix gallery the exhibits were still more lost to view.

PART Il.—INTERNATIONAL EDUCATIONAL CONGRESSES, PARIS, JUNE- 
OCTOBER, 1889. 
From June 12 to October 10, 69 official congresses were held at Paris. They 
were arranged for by 15 committees of 12 members each. The numbers attracted to 
any particular congress varied from 100 to 1,000, while altogether 20,000 persons are 
calculated as having attended. The congresses lasted from three to ten days. 
Unfortunately, it was impossible to publish all the proceedings as in 1878. Enough 
money had not been allocated to cover the expense, and the administration de- 
termined to print short summary accounts. Even for these, however, all the neces- 
_sary MSS. were not sent. : 
Members of the committees were nominated by the minister of commerce and 
industry, commissaire général of the Exhibition. The congresses were thoroughly 
cosmopolitan in character. 
CHEMISTRY. 
The Congress was opened by M. Berthelot. Four sections were at once formed to 
discuss (1) foods, (2) agricultural chemistry, (3) pharmaceutical products, (4) no- 
menclature. The reports sent up by the sections were considered in four general 
meetings of the Congress. The first was chiefly concerned with the methods of 
detecting adulteration in food; the second with the analysis of different soils, 
manures, and fodder; the third was of opinion that a proper study of the questions 
submitted to iticould only be undertaken by several commissions. These were ap- 
pointed for quinquina, opium, pepsin, and analgésine, while the fourth section 
proposed the formation of a permanent international commission, which the presi- 
dent hoped would bring about a complete unity over the whole world in chemical 
- nomenclature. Further details may be found in the Bulletin de la Société chimique. 
MATHEMATICS, 
The extremely technical nature of the discussions not lending itself to an ordinary 
report, only the resolutions arrived at by the Congress and a very elaborate scheme 
for a subject-catalogue of mathematical works have been printed. 
The plan of classification sent out beforehand by the Société mathématique de 
France was adopted as a whole, but with many modifications in details. 
The chief points in the resolutions adopted by the Congress were: 
(1) It is desirable to publish a bibliographical list of works on pure and applied 
mathematics published between 1800 and 1889, as well as works on the history. of 
mathematics from 1600 to 1889. The titles will be arranged, not according to the 
names of the authors, but in the logical order of the subjects treated. 
(2) A supplement will be published once every ten years. 
(3) Works that are intended for students and that do not contain original results 
will be excluded. 
 
-P-A-G-E-161
” EDUCATIONAL CONGRESSES AT PARIS IN 1889. 183 
(4) Treatises on applicd mathematics will be inserted only in so far as they refer 
to the progress of pure mathematics. 
(5) The Congress adopted. the classification proposed by the porns with the 
modifications adopted at the meetings on July 17 and 18. 
The distinguishing feature in this classification is the employment of a rectangle, 
thus: 
L’3ba 
which means that the work denoted coming in the class L, and thus between K and 
Q, belongs to ‘‘Geometry.’’ Class L comprises “Conics and surfaces of the second 
degree ;” the subclass L’ limits it to “conics,” while the division 3 puts it under the 
_ heading, “‘ Centers, diameters, axes, and asymptotes ;” the section b comprises ‘“Theo- 
rems of Apollonius, properties of pairs of conjugate diameters, construction of 
the axes of a conic, two conjugate diameters being given;” and, finally, a denotes the 
“Theorems of Apollonius.” 
(10) A permanent commission, consisting of five French and eleven foreign math- 
ematical scholars, was appointed to carry out the above resolutions. 
(11) The editors of the mathematical periodicals were requested to cobperate im _ 
giving the greatest possible publicity to the resolutions of the Congress and the 
future decisions of the permanent commission. 
PSYCHOLOGY. 
Preliminary reports on the nine subjects selected by the organizing .ommittee were 
sent out at the beginning of July. In the absence of the president, M. Charcot, the 
Congress was opened on August 6 by M. Ribot. The first congress on physiologic 
psychology was due, he said, to the belief that the principal and daily task of the 
science of psychology was the incessant observation of morbid and normal facts; the 
objectivémethod had taken its place side by side with the introspective method. The 
study of the nervous system, the point of juncture of physiology and psychology, had 
been rejuvenated by the experiments and clinical observations on the localization of 
cerebral activity. Was such a phrase as a psycho-physical laboratory possible fif- 
teen years ago? 
It was impossible in a short speech to generalize the movement of ideas in psy- 
chology; the object of the Congress was not to draw up aninventory, but to prepare 
the way for one. Compared with what remains to be done little has been as yet 
accomplished; we think the physiologic method the right one, and that man’s labor, 
as long as it is confined to the realm of experiment, will never be spent in vain. At — 
the end of the Congress it was agreed to meet again in August, 1892, in England, and 
after considerable discussion the title was altered to ‘Congress on Experimental 
Psychology.” M. Ribot was followed by M. Ch. Richet, the general secretary, on 
the work and aims of the Congress. ‘The members then resolved themselves into four 
sections: A, Hallucinations, with Mr. Sidgwick as president; B, Hypnotism, under 
M. Delboeuf; C, Heredity, under Mr. Galton; D, Muscular sense, under Mr. W. James. 
‘The discussion was based on the lines laid down by the London Society for Psychical 
Research. M. Marillier pointed out how small were the results obtained so far, 
while the statistics were open to considerable error, as the persons who answered 
the set of questions sent out by the London society noted with care the positive, but 
neglected the negative answers. M. Pierre Janet drew attention to the difficulty of, 
determining whether the persons interrogated were really of a sound mind. The 
majority of positive answers were probably sent by persons out of health. 
Mr. Myers maintained that we are sure that a thought may be communicated from — 
one person to another. The name of a playing card can be transmitted without the 
intervention of the ordinary organs of sense.

seeing the sketch. 
Unfortunately it is not easy to vary ae and to deduce laws, nor is it de- 
sirable tospeak of experiments that can not be repealed at pleasure. To get any 
“results requires a large amount of patience. 
M. Ch. Richet was of opinion that if mental transmission were possible, even in 
exceptional cases, it would constitute one of the great discoveries of our time. 
M. Ochorowicz asked if the experiments were carried out with greater success on 
certain days or hours, or when the subject was under certain conditions, and did 
such cases occur in series. M. Sidgwick replied in the affirmative and then proceeded 
to criticise the statement that the best results were obtained when the patient was 
in the hypnotic state. Waking was a mixed and complex condition, indeed it seemed 
_ to be a condition, made up of all the others of which a man is capable. 
--M. Delboeuf had found experiments to run in series of successes and failures. 
Somnambutists have a strange power of reckoning time. If it suggested that a cer- 
tain act should be done in 3,500 minutes it is often performed at the exact time. _ 
At the general meeting photographs of persons in the hypnotic state were shown 
as well as some animals that had been operated upon. A paper was read by M. 
Danilewsky on the hypnotism of animals. He had succeeded in hypnotising the 
- crayfish, crab, shrimp, lobster, frog, crocodile, several birds, etc. . The mechanism of 
hypnotism was the same in men and animals, although, of course, much more com- 
plicated in the former and the elements must be sought for among the animals. 
PHYSICAL TRAINING. 
The Congress was formally opened by M. Jules Simon on June 15. 
A report was then read by M. Pierre de Coubertin, the general secretary and prime 
mover in the physical renascence in France, on physical exercises in the schools of 
England, America, Australia, and the English colonies, Replies were sent from all 
parts of the world. Wherever the English settle sportsare in high honor. Little 
mention is made of riding. Gymnastics are more practiced in America than in Eng- 
land. Reference is given to exercises done with apparatus; combined movements 
although good from the doctor’s point of view fail to attract. After this report a 
long letter from the Rey: J. M. Wilson, the head master of Clifton College, was read. 
Aihletic Sports.—The running races ae on June 10, on the grounds of ane Racing 
Club. There were 375 entries for the fifteen events. 
’ On March 11 there was a paper chase of over 7 miles through the woods of Ville- 
d@Avray, to Marne, Vancresson, and back by way of the Fauses-Reposes to the 
_ Versailles high road. ‘ 
- On Juno 14 a display was given at the new circus by delegates from various 
Swedish gymnastic societies. 
The riding competition took place at the Jardin d’Acclimatation on June 6. One 
hundred and fifty entered from the various higher schools in Paris; they were 
divided into two classes, the juniors-(ages from 10 to 15) and the seniors (over 15). 
Special prizes were given for vaulting. 
Fencing.—The annual competition between the Paris schools, organized by the 
Société d’Encouragement de l’Escrime, took place on June 9, six weeks earlier than 
usual; Next day a new feature was introduced in the competition of the provincial 
Lyeées, and on, the 11th the final heats were decided, At the last display M. Fal- 
litres, the Minister of Education, M. Gréard, and M. Rabier, the director of second- 
ary education, were present. 
« M. Jean Maeé founded in: 1866 the Ligue Francaise de ’Enseignement. It seeks 
to give gymnastic arid military instru ction to children after they leave school till 
they reach the-age of.20.. The cowntry districts form the chief sphere of its labors. 
Its. constitution is curious, since the 1,200. various. branches are completely au-

  EDUCATIONAL CONGRESSES AT PARIS IN 1889. 1135: 
tonomous. During the discussions on the law of compulsory attendance at school 
the league organized an immense petition in its favor, and M. Macé published his 
charming pamphlet, Lettre d@’un paysan d@’Alsace & un sénateur sur instruction _ 
obligatoire. 
In consequence of a circular letter issued on January 1, 1889, by the league, a pre. 
liminary meeting was held in Paris on April 14, and it was decided to hold a Congres - 
international des wuvres instruction populaire par Vinitiative privée, with the 
object (1) of collecting statistics on voluntary educational work in all civilized eoun- 
tries, and (2) to form a common bond between the workers. 
The congress took place on the 5th and 6th of August under the presidency of M. 
Macé, in the Mairie of the 6th.arrondissement, the doors of the Trocadéro being 
closed to it because of the want of official recognition. 
Reports on the condition of popular education in nineteen different countries were. 
sent in, and it was decided by acclamation to form a Ligue internationale de V’en- 
scignement populaire par Vinitiative privée. A second congress was to meet in the 
following year at Brussels, under the -patronage of the Ligue Belge. This project 
proved impossible mainly owing to the difficulty of selecting the language for the 
debates to be held in. Early in May, 1890, a circular letter was sent out in French 
and eleven foreign languages inviting the individual champions of popularinstruction 
to join the ligue in its ‘intellectual crusade against ignorance,” The annual sub- 
scription is 20 francs.* > ;

  CHAPTER TIL 
THE INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS OF SECONDARY AND 
SUPERIOR EDUCATION HELD AT PARIS, 1889.1 : 
  
By M. EpmMonp Drryrus-Brisac, Chief Lditor. 
The International Congress of superior and secondary education is. 
on the point, as we pen these lines, of terminating its labors. Its first 
general session was held on Tuesday, August 6,.at 10 .a.m., in the great 
amphitheater of ancient Sorbonne, and. its closing session in the samo 
hall on Saturday, August 10, and it separated after having exhausted 
all the questions on its programme. The deliberations were continued 
without interruption for one week, in presence of a numerous. assembly 
and of a select. public, whose zeal and interest were not relaxed. for- 
an instant. The success of the congress was brilliant and surpassed 
the hopes of its promoters. The concurrence of several. scientific ses- 
sions at the same time did not operate so injuriously as was feared, and 
we. Saw philosophers, physiologists, and physicians escaping from the 
natural attraction of their own special congresses to bring to vas the 
codperation of their experience and knowledge. 
We have not the time to describe at length and. with minute details 
these discussions, so replete with interest, in which all countries were. 
represented by official delegations as well as by the free initiative of 
many of the most. eminent men, but. we believe that those of our read- 
ers who took part in the labors of the congress as well as those who 
were prevented from assisting, will. appreciate the brief outline here 
given of the course pursued, the questions discussed, and the decisions 
which were reached with unquestionable judgment and after thorough — 
discussion. 
The committee on organization, presided over by M. Gréard, vice- 
rector of the Academy of Paris, submitted as a programme for the dis- 
cussions of the congress the five subjects following: 
First. Limitation and approbation of secondary studies (baccalaureate 
and. certificates of completion), Reporter, M. Pigeonneau.

_ Second. The international equivalence of studies and degrees. Re- 
porters, MM. Bufnoir and Cart. 
Third. The various forms of secondary education: What share in the 
ancient languages, the modern languages, and sciences is suitable to 
‘each? Reporter, M. Croiset. 
Fourth. The method to pursue in the secondary instruction of young 
girls, particularly in living languages and in the sciences. Reporters, 
MM. Bossert, Darboux, and Edmond Perrier. 
Fifth. What place should be assigned to economic and social sciences 
in the programme of superior education? Reporter, M. Boutmy. 
Each of these questions, it should be observed, was made the subject 
of one or more preliminary reports, which were issued in pamphlet form 
and distributed to all the members. These remarkable studies, as 
testified to by the rector of the University of Brussels, with general 
assent, at the closing session, greatly facilitated our. labors; and the 
larger part of their conclusions, almost always in the very terms adopted 
by their authors, were ratified by the congress. 
The general assembly, at its first reunion, confirmed from the outset 
the functions of the committee on organization, and added to it a 
certain number of persons selected from among the foreign nations 
particularly represented at the congress. Conformably to article 6 of 
the rules, the different questions submitted by the committee on 
organization ‘were distributed between the sections of superior and- 
secondary education, The first section chose for its president M. 
Bufnoir, professor of the faculty of law, of Paris, and the second, M. 
Morel, inspector-general of secondary education. Each of the ques- 
tions examined in the sections had for its object a new special report, 
the conclusions of which were discussed in three general assemblies, 
Thursday the 8th, Friday the 9th, and Saturday the 10th of August. 
We publish further on these several reports, with the official report of 
the general assemblies. The analysis of opinions expressed and of the 
solutions adopted will also be found. The congress, with several close 
distinctions, ratified generally at its plenary sessions the decisions 
previously arrived at in the sections. We hope to make known briefly 
their nature and object. : 
The first question submitted to the congress related to the method to 
be pursued in the secondary instruction of young girls, for education 
in living languages and in the sciences. The order of ideas, the prov- 
ince of pure pedagogy, gave place to an exchange of observations mueh 
more interesting because ladies were largely represented in the re- 
union. We had the pleasure of having among us Miss Buss and Miss 
Beale, directresses in England of important institutions for young girls; 
Miss Rosalie See, professor at Wellesley Collegé, United States; Mme. 
Griseri, directress of the Alexandre Manzoni Lyceum for young girls 
at Milan; quite a number of professors of lycées in France.for young 
girls, and several Russians. At the side of these ladies sat M. Erke-
-P-A-G-E-173
  
  CONGRESS OF SECONDARY AND SUPERIOR EDUCATION, 145 
-lenz, director of the school for girls at Cologne, whose presence and 
counsels were valuable in all respects. The reports of Mmes. Mourgues 
and Soult on the decisions reached in section were very remarkable. 
In that which concerned the sciences we may sum up thus: 
First. It is proper to give young girls in lycées lessons in algebra 
to elevate the standard of the education they receive, and because in 
certain cases, notably in arithmetic, algebra simplifies the mode of pro- 
cedure. 
Second. Instruction in geometry should aim at development of the 
mind. The professor will be able to interest the majority of the pupils 
in it provided its application is shown as soon as possible. 
Third. The divison of cosmography into two parts—one belonging 
to geography, the other explaining the appearance of cclestial phe- 
nomena—should be maintained. 
Fourth. Instruction in physical sciences should, above all, be experi- 
mental. 
Everybody seemed to be in harmony with these views. 
The discussion on the living languages was more lively and animated, 
Finally, by a large majority, the congress adopted the following reso-. 
lutions: 
Practical instruction in the living languages should commence as 
early as practicable. } 
Fheoretical instruction should be deferred until the first elements of 
grainmar in the mother tongue have been acquired. 
A very wide divergence of opinion was manifested on the principal 
course to pursue in the study of the living languages. While M. Rabier 
appeared to attach more importance to the reading, in view of scientific 
lms education, M. Bréal contended that the essential thing is 
to become conversant with a language well enough to speak it; so as to 
enter into direct communication with foreign peoples and to become 
intimate with their customs, institutions, and civilization. ; 
M. Egger had been charged with the report on another question 
discussed in the section of secondary education relating to the various 
forms to be given to higher education. The Congress recognized the 
necessity of establishing three types of education, which it named as — 
follows: Classical education—Greek-Latin, Latin humanities, and mod- 
ern secondary education. It will be seen that the title of “‘classic” — 
was exclusively reserved for that education which rests on profound 
study of the ancient languages. But in the main, these designations, 
at least to our idea, possessed only relative importance. It is worthy 
of remark that nobody cared to contest the utility and expediency 
of creating, by the side of ancient classical education, a modern edu- 
eation in which the sciences and the living languages should take the 
place of Greek and Latin. 
The report of M. Croiset tended to yield, in this order of education, 
a marked predominance to literature over the sciences. M. Dietz em- 
ED 90-——10 :

  Ang EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
- ployed the occasion to sustain with his habitual force his favorite theme. Z 
_ For him, modern education should predominate and be in a largé meas- - 
_ure literary. That which, in his eyes, distinguishes secondary instrue- 
tion from primary instruction is the association of a foreign language 
with the maternal language as an instrument of analysis for training 
the mind. <As for ourselves we have always believed that primary 
edueation was the minimum of education necessary alike to all, 
and that secondary education was more solid, more complete, more 
substantial, both in the matter of instruction and the methods em- 
- ployed. Mr. Staniey, of London, who took so brilliant and useful a 
_ part in all the deliberations of the Congress, demonstrated by argu- 
    ments, as clear as they were judicious, that secondary modern educa- 
tion need not be-exclusively literary nor exclusively scientific, but tend- 
ing rather toward large development and high mental eulture through 
harmonious accord with literature and science. This system, defended _ 
with spirit by M. Rosenfeld, and with emphatic language by M. Chap- 
. puis, rector of the Academy of Dijon, was adopted by a pronounced 
_ Inajority. 
The third question proposed by the committee on organization, under 
the title of limitation and sanction of secondary studies (baccalaureate 
e and certificate of maturity), precipitated a series of very delicate solu- 
tions which were not entirely settled by the Congress. The neces- 
sity was clearly recognized that secondary studies should receive a 
sanction; that the best mode of sanction is that which permits corisci- 
- entious pupils of average intelligence to obtain the certificate without 
‘special preparation by following the regular course of studies—in fine, 
account should be made of marks obtained in the class whatever be the 
-mode of sanction adopted. 
M. Herzen, the eminent physiologist of Lausanne, desired to obtain 
from the Congress a bold decision, making the greater part of-univer- 
' sity studies; and particularly medical studies, open to young men com- 
ing from one or the other of the three types of secondary education 
aboye mentioned. But it was not possible without profound discussion 
to dispose of a question of such importance; and this discussion, which 
had. neither been anticipated nor prepared for, was necessarily post- 
poned, much to our regret. 
A very spirited debate was provoked over the preference to be 
accorded to the certificate of maturity, as it is awarded in Germany 
and on the baccalaureate, as it. is given in France. M. Blanchet, 
commending the system in use in almost all foreign countries, in- 
sisted that the examination upon leaving college should be before 
the professors of the institution where the pupil had studied, and 
under the superior control of a delegate of the State. M. Lich- 
 tenberger spoke warmly in the same vein. The various bearings of 
_ this question prevented its being pushed to a vote. Several persons, — 
_ as well in the section as in the plenary meeting, notably M. Pigeon-
-P-A-G-E-175
      CONGRESS OF SECONDARY AND SUPERIOR EDUCATION. 147 
neau and the rector of Dijon, remarked that, for several countries, the 
question had not only a pedagogical interest, but also a political and 
administrative character; that in France notably, and also in Belgium, — 
the proposed reform broke itself against insurmountable obstacles, 
principally because of the unequal value of education in the various 
establishments of secondary instruction, public or free; that while. 
admitting that this proposition might reunite the majority in the Con- 
gress, it neyer would be received by certain governments. What good 
was it to set forth purely platonic views, without possible sanction, and 
consequently without importance. and effect?’ The question was very 
properly raised whether one of the resolutions already adopted by the 
Congress, excluding all special preparation for obtaining a certificate 
of study, does not give sufficient satisfaction to the-adversaries of the 
baccalaureate in its actual form? 
The section of superior education, under the able direction of M. 
Bufnoir, examined two: questions which were made the subject of two 
excellent reports, one by M. Cart, on the national equivalence of 
studies and degrees; the other, by M. Blondel, on the place to assign 
social sciences in superior instruction. 5 
Respecting that which concerns social sciences, we heard the inter- 
esting communications of the Marquis Alfieri, of Florence; M. Gau- 
denzi, of Bologne; M. Urechia, of Bucharest; M. Gentet, of Geneva; 
MM. Van der Rest and Hulin, of Brussels; M. Medweezky, of Pesth, 
and M. Blondel, of Lyons. M. Alfieri, notably presented in the see- 
tion and also in the general assembly, with.his great authority, consid- 
erations of the highest importance touching the Institute of Social 
Sciences, which he founded at Florence on the model of the Free 
School of Political Sciences of Paris, but under somewhat different 
form and with less resources. In what fashion must we organize and 
_ n what frame work must we place this education? On this point the 
most diverse views were presented. 
Some proposed. to establish for its service schools or special faculties, 
while others inclined to attach it either to the faculty of law or the 
faculty of philosophy. In Belgium it is proposed to inaugurate, as 
an experiment, a union of conferences to which the several faculties 
should contribute. For our part, we have been impressed with an 
observation presented in the course of discussion, namely, that it will 
be very dangerous to incorporate this education, now new and in pro- 
cess of formation, with a branch of study having traditional forms long. 
_ sinee settled. The effect of the old education upon the new might be 
depressing; one would fear an arrest of growth, a premature absorption. 
The Congress, adopting the views of the sections, avoided responding 
in a too positive manner to the question presented by the committee — 
on organization, but it affirmed the importance of economic and social 
sciences, in expressing the opinion that they should have a larger place 
than heretofore in superior education. 
 
-P-A-G-E-176
    148 z EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
The discussion on the international equivalence of studies and de- 
grees afforded constantly the liv eliest interest and terminated in the 
happiest conclusions. ; 
The following resolutions were adopted: 
It is proper to admit and establish the international equivalence of 
diplomas, or of certificates, declaring the studies of secondary educa- 
tion required as condition of admission to studies of superior education 
of various orders. 
It is proper to recommend, as a useful international practice, the 
concession to the students of the right to accomplish, in a foreign uni- 
versity, a part of their course. 
It is proper, after valuation of the titles gained and without any 
distinction of nationality, to accord the international equivalence of cer- 
tificates of examination and of degrees from a scientific standpoint and 
as a condition of the pursuit of a more elevated grade. 
Upon the proposition of M. Gentet, and in the midst of applause, 
the President declared, in the name of the Congress, that the vote 
taken in the plenary meeting was unanimous. Many of our compatriots 
who assisted in these debates (among whom we distinguished three 
deans of faculties of the Academy of Paris and several rectors) 
graciously admitted that, up to the present time, in these matters the 
_ traditions of France were not overliberal. In a fine discourse M. 
Bufnoir, resuming the debates of the section, protested particularly 
against that contemptible over-zeal for the public treasury impressed 
upon our regulations and which it was important to have abolished at 
once. In the midst of the first section and of the general assembly — 
following, Dr. Laskowsky, in forcible and elevated language, glow- 
ing with warm sympathy for our country, showed by decisive argu- 
ments that it was of the highest interest to France to facilitate the 
studies of foreigners in her dominions and of her own citizens in for- 
eign countries. The French people did not travel enough, he said; 
they did not see enough; all of the French students who visited for- 
eign nations were too much the apostles of French ideas, French inter- 
ests, French civilization. One could appreciate at this moment from 
the standpoint of the fraternity of peoples the happy results of the 
presence at Paris of so many foreign students. 
As M. Gréard remarked, in the admirable discourse in which he re- 
viewed the discussions and the decisions of the Congress, that had the 
assembly merely given the vote on the equivalence, it sufficed to mark 
the elevated character and utility of these international meetings. 
The representatives of all countries were of one accord in throwing 
down all the useless barriers which separate peoples in their intellec- 
tual interchanges. 
In this very rapid epitome, written in a sort of off-hand vein, we have 
only noticed the most important decisions arrived at by the Congress 
and mentioned the names of a few of the most eminent persons who took
-P-A-G-E-177
5 3 ia a 
CONGRESS OF SECONDARY AND ‘SUPERIOR EDUCATION. 149 
part in the discussion. Elevated and judicious views were presented 
(speaking only of foreigners) by Messrs. Harris and Clarke, delegates 
from the United States; M. Gavard, state councilor of Geneva; M. 
Collard, of the University of Louvain; M. Spruyt, of the University — 
  of Amsterdam; M. Van Hamel, of the University of Groningen; M. | 
Geiser, of Zurich; M. Hartaux,.of Namur; M. Hurdebise, of Hasselt; . 
M. Giner, of Los Rios, and M. Ramon de Luna, of Madrid; M. 
Storm,. of Christiania; M. Mustapha Bey, of Cairo; MM. Basiadis 
and Philaretos, of Athens; Mr. Widgery, of London, and many others 
whom we omit, whose ideas and propositions are contained in the~ 
reports of our meetings. 
But that which above all should be described is the good intent and 
cordiality and, if I may express myself thus, the joy to feel ourselves 
in union and able to communicate to each other all those sincere senti- 
ments of fraternity which leave the most lasting souvenirs in our 
hearts. At,no moment was experienced that lassitude or ennui which 
sometimes characterizes these reunions, There existed but the single 
regret that we were so soon to part. Before our separation, the 
representatives of several countries sought to express to the President 
of the Congress their gratitude and their sentiments of respect and 
admiration. : 
M. Gréard could see to what extent his work and his personality 
gratified ‘the foreign peoples, and how they appreciate here the great 
literary value and likewise the high pedagogical standard of his mag- 
nificent labors on instruction and education of all degrees. Let us add 
that many friends of France, who took part, notably in the name of 
Switzerland, England, Greece, and Italy, after haviig thanked the 
President, the members of the bureau, the many ladies who assisted in 
the Congress, and afforded it so charming an attraction, endeavored to 
mount higher and beyond (to employ their own expressions) in their 
sympathy and good wishes. They testified their appreciation of the 
extended and affectionate hospitality which they received on our soil 
and in our capital. 
A Frenchman is always happy to hear good words spoken of France, 
but that which gives particular value to such sentiments is the sin- 
eerity of those who express them in their own name or in the name of 
their country. Itis for us to place a hand in that which is extended, 
to draw closer the bonds of fraternity that unite us to various peoples, 
and, as the desire was affirmed repeatedly in the Congress, to: encour- 
age anew, at an early period, another of these international meetings, 
where so many ideas are exchanged, where so many results are com- 
municated, where decisions so useful to all are accepted, where personal 
relations so profitable and so attractive are formed by each one, and 
which, in bringing individuals together, contribute so powerfully to 
unite ‘all peoples in the aspiration for progress and in the conception, 
growing each day clearer and more. enlightened, of the numerous in- 
terests and wants that are common to all civilized nations. 7

THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF AUGUST 8, 1889. 
PRESIDENCY OF MR. 0. GREARD, 
The session opened at 10 minutes after 9 o’clock. 
The president read articles 15 and 16 of the rules, explaining the Yeagon why 
the Congress should determine all the questions submitted by Saturday, at the latest. 
The president granted permission for reading M. Egger’s report on the third ques- 
tion submitted to the Congress—‘‘ The various forms of secondary education—what 
share in the ancient languages, modern languages, and sciences is suitable to each?” 
Before proceeding to the discussion of the report of M. Egger, the president stated 
that M. Bonet-Maury, librarian of the Pedagogical Museum, hed invited the mem- 
bers of the Congress to visit the exhibit of that office at the Champ-de-Mars, He 
also explained to the Congress that the portion of the subscriptions from which it — 
was intended to liquidate the cost of printing reports should in the absence of M. 
Vintéjoux, the treasurer, be placed in the hands of M. Dreyfus-Brisac. 
The president thereupon declared the discussion open. 
M. Micé, on the question of the forms of secondary education, urged that superior 
primary education should be changed so as not to make it conflict, as is now done, 
with secondary education. A change was demanded in professional education. He 
asked that a decision be reached on the view he had submitted. The president 
remarked that this would encroach upon the proper domain of the Congress of pri-

                   mary ication: He | bee at this time to discuss the positive prvpoitons of 
he section. c 
= First. It is proper to recommend, and consequently to establish, several paginas 
of ‘secondary education. » 
~ The president explained what these standards were: the first, ancient classic sec- 
- ondary education, comprehending the study of Greek and Bates second, secondary 
education, not comprehending Greek, but only Latin; third, modern secondary edu- 
cation based on the study of modern languages, letters, and sciences, embracing 
neither Greek nor Latin, 
The resolution of the section was deliberated upon. 
bifurcation would be encountered with this aggravation that they would be felt more 
> quickly than heretofore. 
The president replied that there were imperative needs and that secondary educa- 
tion should be ready to respond to them. Questions of application were not 
referred to the Congress. 
As no one desired to speak further, the president put the question to vote. “It is 
_proper to recommend, and eonsequently to establish, several standards of secondary 
education,” and the proposition was adopted. 
~ Second. Is it proper to maintain simultaneous and obligatory education in Greek 
“and Latin ? 
The president suggested that the proposition to make optional the study of Greek 
was rejected by the fact that overwork would ensue, and that the Congress had 
implicitly accepted the creation of a secondary education which comprehended only 
Latin. 
The proposition was submitted for diseussion, : é 
- Mr. Stanley approved the decisions of the section.. He submitted that if it be- 
- came necessary to sacrifice either language it should rather be Latin, since the aim 
of secondary education is to compare—to associate our actual ideas with those of 
antiquity, since all that which comes to us from the Romans emanates in reality from   
. mind, all that relates to Greece should be placed in the first rank. 
The proposition being submitted to vote, was adopted. 
Third. It now remains to examine the question, ‘Is it proper to permit a second 
form of classical secondary education where only one ancient language, the Latin, 
48 studied?” 
M. Basiadis stated that a society existed in Germany which favored the establish- 
ment of a special gymnasium where only the Greek i istaught. If the pending propo- 
sition were accepted, it hecame necessary to organize two or three Iyeeums where 
the Greek only should be taught as the aficient language. 
_ M. Erkelenz stated that this society mentioned by M. Basiadis existed no longer. 
The question had only been examined theoretically. 
'M. Gaufrés expressed the opinion that pupils omnld not be found to learn only the 
~ Greek. 
M. Micé declared that, in suppressing the Greck, aa in Latin was dimin- 
ished, and consequently that of French. He considered that actual classical educa. 
tion and secondary modern education should suffice. 1 
M, Perrot coneurred with M. Gaufrés. In studying only the Greek and not de- 
-siring to study but the Greek, was to interdict all point of comparison. He never- 
_ theless accepted the lyceum where only Latin is taught.’ 
‘Mr. Stanley, in the denomination of the new education, proposed to substitute 
~ literary for the classic. 
M. Michel Bréal said that it was important to know how this secondary educa- 
_ tion, reduced to a single language, should be established. If it is installed in insti- 
_ tutions created expressly for it, that was very acceptable. It might happen in 
effect that the necessity would be recognized for going back deeper into the past, 
  _M. Bufnoir expressed the fear that in these conditions all the inconveniences of ©

-P-A-G-E-183
  CONGRESS OF SECONDARY AND SUPERIOR EDUCATION. 155 
  that education in French should be given a more solid basis, and in that case 
Latin should be an adjunct to modern studies. This method of proceeding did not 
present any inconvenience. But it would be otherwise if we proceeded by way of. 
- suppression and retrenchment: in limiting establishments to one language that up to 
the present time had taught twe. This sort of proceeding was not to be recom- 
mended, although it has the appearance of being the easiest. Colleges thus treated 
would regard themselves as curtailed; their; professors would feel out of placeand = 
depressed, and this suppression would be considered as announcement of ulterior — 
suppressions. Experiment thus made under bad conditions would not answer; to 
expunge the Greek froma eollege would not suffice to make it strong in the modern 
Janguages. In the first hypothesis Latin would be considered an acquisition; in 
the second, a fragment, probably destined itself to disappear. Those who desired ; 
this form of secondary education should therefore seek to realize it by creations oe 
carefully elaborated, and not by obliterations which, if they are convenient, are as 
unproductive as they are easily made. ee 
The president stated that the three types of education existed in Belgium under 
the names of Greco-Latin humanities, Latin humanities, and Modern humanities. 
He favored preservation of the word “classit,” which implies for the education to 
which it is attached a disinterested aim. 
M. Dietz proposed to define these words “secondary” and ‘‘classic.” Does the 
benefit which is drawn from classical studies apply to those which embrace antiquity — 
or to those which deal with languages foreign te the native language of the pupil? — x 
Since primary education is open to’all, it would seem that secondary education is — 
that which follows. For M, Dietz, the words secondary education signified educa- 
tion in two degrees: education by a language other than the native one; the other 
Janguage becoming an instrument of analysis for aquiring complete possession of im 
the national language, would alone be insufficient to secure complete culture of gfe ‘ 
mind. 
M. Dietz thought. likewise that, for foreigners, French literature of the seven- 
teenth century offered an instrument of esthetic culture much superior te that of oe. 
Latin. , a 
A member stated that in Italy elassical education required actually eight years’ 
study, the last five years being for Greek alone, In addition to this education 
» there was another—a technical one, comprehending neither Greek nor Latin. 
After a short discussion relating chiefly to questions of organization of the new 
education, the president put M. Basiadis’ proposition to vote, and it was rejected, SNe 
The assembly proceeded afterwards to give expression tothe resolution conformably ~ 
to the view of Mr. Stanley, approved by M. Michel Bréal, te remove the classic 
classification from the new education. aly 
A member proposed to style the new instruction the ‘Latin humanities. ” A short 
discussion followed, participated in by MM. G. Morel, Kuhff, Spruyt, Harlaux, 
and Perrot. 
The president proposed to put to vote the denomination of “Latin humanities.” M. 
Hamel moyed to name the new instruction “semi-classic.” The name “ Latin humani- 
ties,” being put to vote, was adopted. 
A member proposed to amend by naming the third standard of education, “second- 
ary classic-modern.” This amendment was rejected. 
Another member proposed the name ‘‘Modern humanities.” This denomination A 
was rejected. : 
The new instruction therefore was called “modern secondary education.” . 
    OF THE PART THE SCIENCES SHOULD TAKE IN CLASSIC EDUCATION. 
The president explained that the section had decided to allow a slow, gradual, and 
very methodical education, directed in a manner, as much as possible, to retard 
specializations.
-P-A-G-E-184
  156 EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
M. Herzen belicved that in these conditions the Congress had contradicted itself, 
since it had adopted three standards of education. : 
The president repeated that there was no contradiction. In the classic education, 
the part yielded to the sciences should be relatively restricted, larger, however, in 
- the Latin humanities, and again, larger in modern secondary education. 
M. Rosenfeld explained that M. Croiset wished to say that in classic education 
letters were given a preponderating place, but the sciences, nevertheless, were not 
forgotten. 
Question of the living languages.—The draft of the section is adopted. MM. 
- Arnoulin and Dietz proposed amendments, which were rejected. 
M. Rosenfeld moved, like M. Dietz, that the part given to living languages should 
be augmented in all the classes. 
Mr. Stanley, in his turn, moved that a part be given to the living languages as 
large as the necessities of various instructions in elementary classes permitted. This 
proposition was adopted. 
The director of secondary education asked at this time in what conditions instruc- 
tion in living languages should be given. For himself, and he would insist upon 
the point, reading was the most useful for the pupils, and he urged for it an impor- 
tant place. 
Madame Griseri believed that reading was an excellent means for learning to speak 
the language. * 7 
M. Erkelenz concurred in the opinion of M. Rabier. Reading should be, in the 
superior classes, the means of shaping the mind. In reading the great writers be- 
longing to a foreign nation acquaintance is made with another people. 
A number expressed the opinion that it would be better to commence by studies 
of the vocabulary. 
The president replied that the Congress had not actually discussed questions of 
method. ° 
M. Michel Bréal believed it his duty to protest, if it be desired to apply to mod- 
ern languages the methods employed for study of ancient languages. This would be 
to make a false path. After so many years of study, are we really in possession of 
Latin and Greek? No; we possessa language only when we can speak it. We must 
be able at once to pour it from our mind and produce it outside; knowledge of 
text would not suffice. The handling of a language is a form of activity, and 
conversation, even if it be incorrect, proves more than a translation, by means of 
the dictionary, of a page of Goethe or Shakespeare. If it be wished, by favor of the 
word literary, to sanction for modern languages the processes employed for Greek 
and Latin, he believed a method would be recommended which could justify itself 
in respect to the dead languages, but which would be here out of place. It would 
not answer to compare, but to learn. The best_professor of living languages is the 
‘one who, in his lessons, does not pronounce a word of the national language. Com- 
parisons are only useful to him who already knows and who handles freely the two 
languages which are to be compared. 
Modern secondary education.—M. G. Morel stated that the section proposed to sup- 
press in the conclusions formulated in the report of M. Croiset the words ‘literary 
in\a very large measure.” 
M. Dietz moved, to the contrary, that modern secondary education should, above 
all, be literary. 
M. Micé replied that the sciences were an important element of education, which 
could not be relegated: to the second rank in this grade of education. i 
M. Basiadis expressed the fear that placing the word ‘‘scientific” before the word 
“literary” did not™have the appearance of sacrificing letters; he proposed to reverse 
" the proposition. 
M. Dietz moved the following: ‘“‘The Congress expresses the view that modern 
 
-P-A-G-E-185
  CONGRESS OF SECONDARY AND SUPERIOR EDUCATION. 157 
secondary education, while conserving its practical character, should at the same 
time devote a large part of its instruction to literary culture.” 
M. G. Morel urged that this was a wording too special to France. He pre- | 
- ferred the language of the section which, he said, had not desired to give predomi- ~ 
mance to either party. 5 
The president summed up the discussion, and put to vote the draft of the section. 
It was adopted.   
The second question, ‘Is it well in modern secondary education to give a place to ee 
Latin?” was determined negatively. a 
Third question: ‘Is it proper in modern secondary education to make instruction 
in living languages more important and more literary than it actually is?” Adopted. 
The president fixed the order of the day for each of the two sections. 
The next general reunion will take place August 9. * 
The session adjourned at noon. 
GENERAL ASSEMBLY, AUGUST 9, 1889. 
PRESIDENCY OF MR. 0. GREARD. 
The session opened at 9 a, m. 
The order of the day was the discussion of the two following questions: 
First. Of the method to follow in the secondary instruction of young girls, par- 
* ticularly for education in living languages and education in the sciences. 
Second. International equivalence of studies and degrees. 
Tur First QUESTION STUDIED IN THE SECTION OF SECONDARY EpvucatTion. . 
EDUCATION IN THE SCIENCES. 
Mile. Mourgues, reporter, read her report. 
After this reading the president declared the discussion open as to conclusions. 
Mile. Mourgues stated that a proposition from M. Darboux, concerning education 
in arithmetic, had been omitted. ‘It is necessary, in this education, to return for 
several reviews, to give from the outset rules of calculation and simple problems, 
and to introduce, little by little, the reasonings and the theories.” 
Mile. Mourgues moved that the Congress consider these observations, which mo- 
tion was adopted. 
The conclusions of Mlle. Mourgues’s report on mathematical sciences were after- 
wards adopted, namely: 
First. It is proper to introduce algebra in instruction in arithmetic. 
Second. Geometry should be taught chiefly as a gymnastic, as a means of disci- 
pline for the mind. 
Third, Instruction in cosmography should, in clementary classes, be chiefly de- 
scriptive, and in superior classes chiefly mathematical 
Fourth. Physical sciences. This instruction should be, before all, general in 
manner, experimental, and embracing all the branches of physics. > 
Fifth. Chemistry. Mlle. Mourgues stated that they had not examined as they < 
should concerning this point, which rested on a practical basis. She moved the 
following resolution. which was adopted: ‘Instruction in chemistry should be ele- 
mentary and experimental.” 
Sixth. Natural sciences. This instruction should also be experimental; it should 
be limited to fundamental observations. x 
EDUCATION IN THE LIVING LANGUAGES. 
Mlle. Soult, reporter, gave her lecture from memory. 
The report concluded with two resolutions: 
First. Practical education in living languages should commence as early as possible.

Upon the inquiry of Madame Griseri, relative to the method to follow as to pupils 
who have never been'tanght a foreign language, the president replied that the reso-. 
lution adopted by the section responded to that question; the instruction should, 
above all, be practical, which, nevertheless, did not exclude grammar. 
The Miles. Beale, Soult, and’Fanta exchanged several observations on the books 
used in England and France for study of pronunciation. 
The first resolution being put to vote, was adopted. 
‘maternal languages have been acquired. 
~M, Bossert stated that to learn'a language it became necessary to possess, from 
the outset, a certain vocabulary. B esides, it was necessary to distinguish between 
* the grammar which goes from the example to the rule (and it should be early em- 
ployed), and that which goes from the rule to the example, which should be em- 
ployed as late as possible. 
The second resolution was adopted, reserving M. Bossert’s observation. 
The president here remarked that the study of living languages, being considered 
- ameans of general culture, it would be desirable if young girls could travel in the. 
country of phi they had learned the language. 
M. Hertzen asked if the study of Latin is permitted to young girls in their lycées _ 
to which the president responded affirmatively; nevertheless, this instruction ad- 
dresses itself to the choice; it is also optional. x 
M. Dietz moved to submit the following view: In the secondary education of® 
young girls the same professor on all possible occasions, particularly in the elemen- 
tary classes, should be charged with the instruction of the national language as 
well as of a foreign language. 
M. Dietz thought time would be gained in proceeding thus, and that the Tarek 
language would serve in learning the national language. 
_ M.Erkelenz combated M. Dietz’s proposition; all the young girls who entered 
lycées did not finish their course. In such case they would leave the establishment 
without thoroughly knowing either their own or a foreign language. 
_ - Madame Desparmet-Ruelle believed that, for elementary classes, the proposition 
of Mr. Dietz was a good one. 
M. G. Morel said it would be very difficult, not tosay impossible, to find pean 
capable of accomplishing this task. 
Miss Beale moved to seek a general formality for grammatical terms. 
M. Spru yt supported M. Diet2’s proposition, and urged that two diplomas for edu- 
- cation in languages should be established; one for elementary classes, where at the 
same time the professor taught the mieet language, and the other for superior 
classes, where the professor taught only the foreign language. 
The proposition of } as Deitz being put to vote, was rejected. That of Miss Beale 
was adopted. ” 
_ Mr. Widgery offered the following resolution: 
“A master of living languages should possess a knowledge theoretical and prac- 
tical of phonography.” 
Mr. Stanley followed the speech delivered in English on this oceasion by Mr. 
Widgery. Knowledge of phonography was necessary to teach pronunciation in a 
7 rational way. Mr. Widgery’s proposition was adopted. 
-M. Michel Bréal ventured to remark that by “living languages” was meant or- 
dinarily English and German, Without wishing to object to the choice of these two 
languages, he regretted that languages no less worthy of study were set so completely 
aside, particularly Italian and Spanish, two beautiful tongues, which opened access

SECOND QUESTION STUDIED BY THE SECTION oF SupERion EpvucatIon. 
    IN’ 
  ERNATIONAL EQUIVALE 
  EOF STUDIES AND-DE 
  M. Cart read his report. 4 : 
First. It is proper to establish international equivalence of diplomas and cortifi- a 
cates declaring the studies of secondary education required as condition of admis- 
sion to studies of superior education of various orders. se 
Second. It is proper to recommend as a useful international practice the concession — 
to the students of the right to accomplish in a foreign university a portion of their 
course, 7 
Third. It is proper to adjust, after valuation of the tittes gained and without dis-_ 
tinction of nationality, the international equivalence of cert es of examination 
and of degrees from a scientific standpoint, and as condition of the pursuitof a higher 3 
degree. 
First resolution. —M, Himly proposed to satisfy a desire expressed by the rector 
of Brussels by saying, ‘It is proper to establish everywhere.” 
M. Gentet proposed to insert, ‘‘It is proper to maintain or to establish.” 
Mr. Stanley asked if the resolutions adopted by the Congress would not be offi- 
cially communicated to the foreign universities. 
The Congress decided that this question should be subsequently renewed. 
The first resolution, as amended by M. Gentet, was unanimously adopted, 
Miss Beale proposed the creation of an international society of secondary educa- 
tion. The president decided to refer this question to the following session, 
Second resolution.—M. Bufnoir remarked that the mchiaewione asked existed in BS 
f i   
  M. Erkelenz stated that it existed only for doctors and philologists. 
The resolution being put to vote, was adopted. 
Third resolution.—M. Cart stated that the Congress only demanded authorization 
for students to present themselves for superior examinations. It did not seek pro- 
fessional trainings, but only to obtain degrees. 
A discussion ensued between MM. Himly, Bufuoir, Colmet de Sauterre, and several 
. other members, on the equivalences to accord from the standpoint of study of leteete 
It was observed that the pin gaiton! absolutely reserved all the rights of each 
- faculty. F « ; 
The proposition being put to vote, was adopted unanimously. z 
M. Bufnoir proposed to explain that France was the only country where fiscal 
conditions were imposed for delivery of certificates of equivalence. He hoped in 
_pointing out that fact the situation would change. 3 
_ M. Gentet moved that the report should, state the fact that the propositions were 
voted unanimously. Adopted. 
On motion of Mr, Stanley, the section was unanimously requested to make sees : 
the propositions on international equivalence of studies and degrees to all the for- 
eign universities. S 
The session adjourned at half past 11..

    160 EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF AUGUST i0, 1889. 
_. The session opened at 90’clock. 
The order of the day was the discussion of the following questions: 
First. Limitation and sanction of secondary studies. (Baccalaureate and certifi: 
cates of maturity.) 
Second. What place should be assigned to economic and social sciences in the 
programme of superior education? 
Fimst QUESTION EXAMINED IN THE SECTION OF SECONDARY EDUCATION. 
LIMITATION AND ‘SANCTION OF SECONDARY STUDIES, 
M. Egger read his report. The first conclusions were adopted, namely: 
(a) It is necessary that secondary studies have a sanction. 
(b) The best mode of sanction is that which permits the conscientious student, of 
average intelligence, to obtain the final diploma without special preparation and 
particular efforts, in following simply the regular course of studies. 
A third resolution was contributed, thus: 
“Whatever be the mode of sanction adopted, count should be kept, for obtaining 
final diploma of studies, of the anterior notes and of the classing of the students in 
* . the establishment where he has made his studies.” 
The rector of Montpellier considered the formula too absolute, because of inequal- 
ity from the standpoint of studies, of private establishments, colleges, and lycées. 
M. Chappuis moved to replace the words ‘‘should be kept” by the words ‘‘it is 
desirable, if possible, to keep,” 
The resolution, with the new wording, was adopted. 
M. Blanchet moved the following view: 
“Candidates should be judged by a jury composed of their professors, to whom 
shonld be added a delegate of the State.” 
M. Chappuis recalled the discussion which had taken place in the section, which 
concluded to reject that view. 
M. Lichtenberger thought there would be advantage in adopting it. He believed 
it possible to reconcile the rights of the State with the freedom of education, and 
he urged that we place ourselves upon the standpoint of pure pedagogy. 
M. G. Morel replied that the value of personnel was too unequal in He yarious 
establishments to admit of an interior jury. 
Dr. Lagneau suggested that numerous partial examinations should be undergone 
before the special examiners, so that count of notes could be really kept. 
M. Pigeonneau remarked that the possibility of the constitution of an interior jury 
was implicitly indicated in the second view. He thought it was not proper to bring 
- it out more distinctly and forcibly. 
M. Urechia urged that the baccalaureate-conferring rights should be held to the 
second proposition of M. Pigeonneau. The question presented the same difficulties 
in Roumania as in France. 
The president closed the discussion and moved. to go on without resolving. Adopted. 
The section likewise pronounced the view that the three sanctions permitted for the 
three types of secondary education should afford access to the different orders of 
_superior studies, each one following the nature of the secondary studies which it 
crowns. Adopted. 
M. Herzen moved that they specify the careers to which each of the three afore- 
» said sanctions led. 
M. Urechia thought this would trench upon the domain of superior education. The 
autonomy of superior “schools demands that no view should be pronenneed on the 
point tguched upon by M. Herzen. 
M. Herzen feared that three keys had been manufactured, one of which opened 
all the doors of the faculties, while the other two closed them.

The president replied that special locks would be fabricated. 
Sxrconp Question EXAMINED IN THE SECTION OF SUPERIOR EDUCATION. 
WHAT PLACE SHOULD BE ASSIGNED TO ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL SCIENCES IN THE 
PROGRAMMES OF SUPERIOR EDUCATION? 
M. Blondel reported orally. 
In view of very diverging opinions, on motion of M. Dreyfus-Brisac, it*was de- 
cided to offer the following resolution. 
“The section is of opinion that it is proper to bestow on economic and social sci- 
ences a much larger place than heretofore in superior education.” 
The section resolved itself into an inquest on the actual condition of the situation 
in various countries represented in the congress. 
M. Geiser, of Zurich, and the Marquis Alfieri gave certain information to the 
congress on this question. 
M. Medveczky approved the view expressed by the section. Without asking a 
positive vote, he believed in the possibility of establishing for social sciences a com- 
plete system of education leading to a sanction (degree). 
After a brief discussion, in which MM. Urechia and Rosenfeld participated, 
the view of the section was adopted. 
The president, in a speech frequently interrupted by applause, gare a résumé of 
the labors of the congress and their importance. 
Several foreign members, MM. Laskowsky, of Switzerland; Stanley, of Eng- 
land; Basiadis, of Greece, and Madame Griseri, of Italy, replied to the president’s 
mpbech thanking him for the high competence and exquisite courtesy whieh he had 
manifested in directing the debates. They offered their thanks to the Government 
and the French people for the wide and generous hospitality they had received.    
Notably, the Marquis Alfieri declared that, whatever might be the political events, | 
Italy would always and most deeply be grateful to France for all that France had 
done for her. 
The president then informed the members of the congress that they would be re- 
ceived, on presentation of their cards, to the ‘punch of honor” to be given by the 
minister of public instruction to-morrow (Sunday) evening, at 9 o’clock. 
The president thereupon declared the congress closed, and the session adjourned 
at a quarter past 11 o’clock. 
The following is the complete text of the address delivered by M. Gréard at the 
closing of the congress: 
The session of the congress has been Gee and laborious. Iam confident that it 
hhas been fecund. You have exchanged observations on all the questions submitted. 
On some you have reached conclusions ready to be put in application. 
The secondary education of young girls was not that which least occupied. the 
congress. That was just. Is not the last born the most delicate? Two points spring 
from the general ideas you have debated and the discussions you have touched upon; 
the first is, that the education of young girls should not be intended as a superficial 
ornament; that for them, as for young men, the object sought to be accomplished 
should be at once the acquisition of a certain amount of well-digested knowledge 
and the culture of the faculties; the second is that, if we may not refuse aid to 
women capable of raising themselves above the ordinary standard, secondary edu- 
cation, addressing itself to the average mind, should seek its guide in the conditions 
of time, of health, of the social situation, and of aptitude common to the greatest 
number, aiming to prepare young girls for the family life, of which they are des- 
tined to become the moral support and charm. 
For secondary education of young men, considering the mass of knowledge accu- 
mulated by the programmes of all countries and the impossibility of teaching it all 
to all uniformly and encyclopedically, you have recognized the necessity of modify-

eg al Gt li he Ga vea pate 
       
-P-A-G-E-190
  162 _ EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. s : 
ing and diversifying tho types of lyc6es or secondary schools. You have mean- - 
time loudly proclaimed the duty of maintaining, while fortifying it, the. standard 
based on the knowledge of two superior classical languages—the Greek and Latin— 
the study of which has been so long the thinking cradle of humanity, and which 
to-day is again the bond of the intelligence of the élite, $ 1 
But at the same time it has appeared to you that, side by side with this régime of 
pure classic, it was not impossible to constitute, for those who have need to reserve 
a portion of their time and force for different instruction, another form of secondary 
education reposing upon the profound knowledge of-a single ancient language, that 
which is brought near to us more by its grammatical parentage than by the ideas of 
which it is the interpreter—the Latin tongue. You have likewise thought that in 
a state of civilization which hasso many wants and so many interests to satisfy there 
was room also for secondary instruction, where the national language, combined 
with the study of living languages, should be the basis of education. Modern edu- 
cation, “real” education, as some wish to call it—the word signifies but little when 
its true character is agreed upon, which is for this as for the other two—disinter- 
ested culture of the mind. 
In the course of the discussion you have met more than once the question of the 
method to follow in instruction in the living languages, some insisting mbre particu- 
larly upon the necessity for acquiring, above all, practical possession of the language; 
urging the advantages which young men and young women, for their general cul- 
ture, would obtain in the perusal of the great works of foreign literatures, finally 
convincing all that a living language was not only made to be spoken, but that a 
language which is spoken need not fail to serve that other intercourse, none the less 
precious—communion with the sentiments and ideas of those who have left to us in 
their works the better part of themselves. ‘ 
The baccalaureate provoked contradictory argument. That one sanction of sec- 
ondary studies is indispensable; that this. sanction should be the natural result of 
aregular course, of a series of well-made classes, that it was proper to keep count of 
notes merited by the candidate at the end of his scholastic life—on these points 
you have readily agreed. On the question of the jury impaneled to deliver these - 
sanctions, you have hesitated to pronounce in presence of difficulties which might 
arise from liberty of instruction in the countries where it is established. But the 
result of the debate was that the countries of baccalaureate, or of examinations 
undergone before juries other than the juries composed of the usual masters of the 
‘candidate, had sométhing to do to arrive at a course of studies more satisfactory in 
- its direction and less uncertain in its results. 
The questions prepounded for superior education were of high character. On the 
place to make for social sciences, the Congress hardly went beyond a sort of inquest. 
That inquest produced most interesting results, of which our report will preserve 
the remembrance. You have gathered among other things views and projects on 
organization which will afford weighty thought to all minds anxious for the moral 
future of the world. 
It was easy to reach conclusion on the examination of the international equiva- 
lence of studies and degrees. Discarding from the question all that had reference 
to the practice of professions to which the grades might lead, and all that which 
touched upon the interests of the state, you have given preference in the pure order 
of studies to a doctrine liberal and wise, a doctrine which throws down useless 
and hurtful barriers without striking a blow at the necessary authority of great 
academic associations or universities charged with the protection of high education. 
You have opened the road to reconciliation, to communication, to reciprocal sagac- 
ity for the greater elevation of science and the sentiments of confraternity which it 
awakes and cherishes. 
If your labors had terminated only with this resolution, it would have sufficed to 
mark their character and justify their utility, There are nevertheless minds cha-

grined, or rather, so to speak, a little skeptical, who ask of what use is the Congress? ; 
Should it not have promoted as soon as possible an exchange of documents where 
each would have found that which he sought? The document plays to-day 2 consid- 
erable part in your studies; it must not be belittled ; it prepares, it brightens, it com- 
pletes the discussions. Bus can anything except Ste living communications give — 
  to the mind the warmth, the strength, the seductions of speech? The conferences, _ 
necessarily somewhat hurried, such as we have had within the limit of time ac- 
corded us, can hardly supply the precision of a book, and I do not doubt but that 
in our reports many inaccuracies and also many contradictions of detail will be 
found. That which was of importance was to establish the principles which are the _ 
light and the soul ‘of things, and you have established them. I repeat, it is not — 
documents, nor yet books, that can produce the sympathy to which the discussion — 
gave birth, among those who have reunited elevated interests. 
A common thought manifested itself more than once in your deliberations—that it 
was desirable that all the resolutions adopted should be communicated to all the 
corps that they touched; that the study to be followed should be conducted to the 
end by the persevering effort of all countries, and in one word that the international : 
bond which you have forged should be maintained, extended, and fortified. You 
have confided to your bureau the task of accomplishing this desire, It will not be

REPORTS. 
SeEctron or SUPERIOR EDUCATION. 
THE INTERNATIONAL EQUIVALENCE OF STUDIES AND DEGREES. 
The section of superior education has been engaged upon the question of the _ 
international equivalence of studies and degrees. Its task was specially facilitated 
by M. Bufnoir, professor at the Faculty of the Right at Paris. It only remained, 
in the discussion, to follow the identical order of questions propounded by M._ 
Bufnoir at the close of his labor. 
The session of Wednesday morning was devoted wholly to ascertaining the sys- 
tem adopted by the several countries represented at the congress. 
_ M. Collard, for Belgium; M. Gaudenzi, for Italy; M. Laskowsky, for the Swiss- 
French; M. Ferrari-Perez, for Mexico; M. De Medwersky, for Austro-Hungary; 
-M. Philarétos, for Greece; Ibralfim-Mustapha-Bey, for Egypt; M. Van Hamel, for 
Holland; Mr. Stanley, for England; M. Urechia, for Roumania, and M. Giner de los 
Rios, for Spain, spoke successively, as well to give information_as incidentally to ex- 
press their opinions concerning the true basis of the question. 
It supervened, from their statements, that nearly all of the foreign counttiss 
required for admission to the universities a diploma verifying the real secondary 
  studies, and that all universities, very broadly and without any pecuniary require- - 
ment, granted access to those foreigners who were the bearers of a diploma analo- 
gous to a national diploma. Authority to take the course is granted by the competent 
faculties, sometimes in each particular case, sometimes and more generally, by 
reason of a superior decision, covering all, and which confers an actual Hehy upon 
the bearer of the foreign diploma, 
Concerning the curriculum completed in part in a foreign university, the majority 
of the countries were, with certain restrictions, very favorable to that practice. : 
From the professional standpoint, the foreign degrees, and among others, those 
granted by the Faculties of Law and of Medicine, are not generally recognized, un- 
Jess under the reservation of a complementary examination relating more especially 
to professional points; for example, in medicine proof of practice is required, such 
_as examination as to a disease or a surgical operation, and questions on pathology 
are asked.
-P-A-G-E-192
  164 © EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. ° 
It seemed to be evolved from this morning session, @ session more of statement — 
_ than of debate, that an unanimous tendency existed to make it very easy for foreign 
- students to gain admission to the several universities. The question became com- 
plicated, since in the evening session and that of the following day, examination 
was had concerning the reservations under which a foreign student should be admit- 
ted, and how and by whom the equivalence of a foreign diploma with a national 
diploma should be adjusted. 
It appeared to some that the system actually in force in France was sufficiently 
liberal; it was important that the equivalence should not be adjusted by the Gov- 
ernment until after the advice of the competent faculty; by that, on one hand; 
guaranty was obtained of a sufficient preparation, and on the other hand the task 
of the Government was facilitated in the instance where it was deemed proper to 
refuse the equivalence. 
Others thought that this system afforded too much room for arbitrary action, 
where a favor, not aright, was granted. They feared that the foreigner, being never 
assured of obtaining this favor, would be but little encouraged to frequent a foreign 
university. It seemed necessary, once for all, to recognize the value of this or that 
diploma from the special standpoint of admission into the several faculties, and thus 
give the foreign student guaranty that, on his arrival, the right to regularly enter 
his name would not be contested. It would not be, then, each faculty which would 
decide in each particular case; a competent commission would be charged with the 
examination of the various certificates, and would recognize their value in a definite 
manner; providing always, which goes without saying, that the foreign diploma 
should suffer no restriction. 
Others again, in greater number, declared that the foreigner should be admitted on 
the sole condition of producing proof of the preliminary studies, required in his 6wn 
county for admission there to studies of superior education of the same order. 
This last solution appeared hardly possible unless under the exception that the 
foreigner, having obtained his degrees on these conditions, could practice only in his 
own country; in effect, the foreign requirements being possibly less on entrance, there — 
~ would ensue in respect of natives an inequality of treatment truly unjust. 
In return, it was observed that in the case where the diploma would be recognized 
as valuable only for the foreigner, there would be a strong chance of its having for 
the foreigner only a mediocre value. 
Four opinions were thus presented: 
Examination in each particular case by one competent faculty. 
Examination of foreign diplomas by a competent commission, which should decide 
on their value. A 
Admission to the faculties of foreign students on the sole condition of producing 
proof of tho preliminary studies required in their own countries for admission there 
to superior studies of the same order, with the exception, always, that the diplomas 
conferred on these conditions should be of value only to the foreigner. 
Admission, without any reservation, to foreign students under the conditions 
above named. ! ° 
The conflict of ideas made the light flash out; but when too many ideas are pre- 
sented, the light becomes too bright and blindness ensues. The discussion threat- 
ened to becoma endless. : 
M. Gavard, councilor of state, of Geneva, urged that we should not enter too much 
upon details; that we should hold ourselves simply to the first line of section 2, of 
the report of M. Bufnoir, slightly modified, and that the following conclusion be 
adopted: ~ 
The congress, considering that there is much advantage in making it easy to stn: 
dents to frequent foreign universities, declares: 
It is proper to establish the internctional equivalence of diplomas or certificates 
defining the studies of secondary education required as condition of admission to 
studies of superior education of various orders.
-P-A-G-E-193
  CONGRESS OF SECONDARY AND SUPERIOR EDUCATION. 165 
This proposition was carried by a large majority, but quite a number abstained 
from voting. 
Before the vote was taken the congress rejected, as not being within its authority 
and as impossible to satisfy, a desire of M. Casanova, professof at the University 
of Madrid, who requested the congress to name an international commission which 
should propose the best manner of arriving at the equivalence and reciprocity of 
diplomas, based upon uniformity of programme and studies. 
After a brief exchange of views, the second question propounded by M. Bufnoir 
in his report was unanimously decided in the affirmative. The section requested the 
congress to declare: It is proper to recommend, as a useful international practice, 
concession to the students of the right to achieve in a foreign university a portion of 
their term of study. 
Concerning the third question propounded by the reporter and ionipcebegiedes in 
the following terms: ‘‘Is it desirable and possible to establish the international equiv- 
alence of degrees, whether it be from a scientific standpoint, as condition of seeking 
a higher degree, or from the professional standpoint?” the section immediately dis- _ 
carded the words “from the professional standpoint. It appeared useless to engage 
in a discussion which afforded no opportunity to reach conclusion, in view of the great 
difference of conditions required in various countries for practice of a profession. 
The first part of the question could not be determined in the affirmative except 
under certain exceptions. 
In effect, if, for the examinations which terminated the secondary studies and 
opened access to the faculties, it was desirable and possible, in view of the great 
analogy of these examinations between themselves, to establish an international 
equivalente, it would be in turn vexatious and difficult not to leave to each faculty 
the right to judge whether this or that examination passed by the foreigner equaled 
or not that which it required. On the other hand, several members of the section 
having observed that in France they readily granted equivalence to foreigners, but 
refused them generally to the French themselves, the section adopted unanimously 
the following draft, which it proposed to the congress: 
It is proper to adjust, after valuation and without any distinction of nationality, 
the international equivalence of certificates of examination and of degrees from a 
scientific standpoint and as condition of the pursuit of a higher degree. 
Before proceeding to take this vote the section refused, as precipitating itself 
against insurmountable obstacles, to discuss a proposition made by M. Urechia, dele- 
gate from Roumania, former minister of public instruction, in which he expressed the 
desire that the University of France should take the initiative in bringing together 
an official congress where all the universities should be represented, and that this 
congress should determine the minimum of attainments required for the various de- 
grecs. It should conclude also to found a university federation, which should be 
permitted to solve by a practical method all the questions attached to the equiva- 
lence of studies and degrees. 
Finally, the section of. superior education, considering that there was advantage 
in facilitating to students the frequentation of foreign universities; and consider- 
ing, on the other hand, that it became necessary, in maintaining the standard of 
studies, to admit to the faculties only those students furnishing guaranty of sufficient 
preparation, proposed to the congress the following resolutions: : 
It is proper to establish the international equivalence of diplomas or of certifi- 
cates defining the studies of secondary education required as the condition of ad- 
mission to studies of superior education of various orders. a 
It is proper to recommend, as a useful international practice, concession to the. 
students of the right to achieve in a foreign university a portion: of their period of 
study. 
It is proper to adjust, after valuation of the titles gained and without any dis- 
tinction of nationality, the international equivalence of certificates of examination 
and of degrees, from a scientific standpoint, and as condition of the pursuit of a higher |.

         EDUCATION »PEPORT, 1889-90. 
OF THE PLACE OF SOCIAL SCIENCES .N SUPERIOR EDUCATION, 
The section of superior education having examined at its last session the follow- 
ing question, of the place of economic and social sciences in superior education, one 
of the members present, Rector Van der Rest, made the passing remark that the 
words ‘social science” were entirely sufficient. 
To facilitate the discussions which could hardly fail to arise on a question so ¢om- 
plex, and which the remarkable report of M. Boutmy was of a nature to provoke, 
the president considered it his duty to divide the question submitted into four-para- 
graphs, as follows: 
First. Does there exist anywhere an education organized to teach both economic 
and social sciences? What does this education comprehend? What is its sanction? 
What are the preliminary studies required for pupils admitted to follow it? 
Second. Is it proper to recommend the organization of such an education? What 
should it comprehend? What should be its sanction? What preliminary studies 
should be required for pupils who may desire admission to this course? 
Third. Can such instruction find place in the framewerk of actual university edu- 
_cation? Should it be assigned to a particular faculty? Should the various faculties 
selected to teach it be required to contribute in common or should it be distributed 
_among them? 
Fourth. Is it not proper, in every case, to recommend, in the faculties of law, the 
development of education in the various branches of political economy? This in- 
struction once developed, could it not be usefully combined with that of various 
branches of the public law, in a manner to constitute an assemblage of studies adapted 
to the wants of young men who are destined for administrative careers, diplomatic 
or consular functions, and for public life? - 
On the first point it was acknowledged at the outset that no part of the instruc- 
tion in social sciences was given with the full amplitude it deserved. But very use- 
ful information was imparted by various members on that which had happened 
abroad. Thus, the Marquis Alfieri told us of the school he had founded at Florence 
in imitation of the school of political sciences directed by M. Boutmy. 
This school gave seventeen courses, of which about one-half were judicial; 
also that a notarial school was annexed. Speaking of the difficulty of reconciling 
the professional class with the purely scientific class, M. Alfieri admitted that the 
Jatter had been somewhat sacrificed. It was the professional class which had been 
taken only into consideration. He said they had for pupils young men of the leisure 
_ elasses, destined for public functions or wishing to enter upon public life; they 
were given.a thorough practical education which does not enter the faculties of law 
where the course of political economy has rather a scientific and theoretic character. 
The school of Florence grants a diploma equivalent to certain university diplomas 
required for access to a great number of careers, notably the diplomatic career. It 
serves, besides, as a strong recommendation for occupation in other employments. 
The school has received the privilege of civil personality, and to follow the course 
one must have a bachelor’s degree. 
M. Gaudenzi added several interesting statements concerning an analogous school 
less complete, which had recentiy been founded at Bologna through the initiative 
_ and under the direction of Prof. Montovani Oceadi, but which is directly attached to 
the university. Professors of the university gave the instruction, and this instruc- 
tion, which was reduced to three courses, is simply completory to that given in the 
faculty of law. 
M. De Medveezky, professor from Buda-Pesth,spoke of Germany and Austro- 
Hungary, where education in social sciences is given in the universities, sometimes 
in the faculty of philosophy (which is the rule in Germany), sometimes in the faculty 
of law (which is the rule in Austria), and sometimes in a special faculty. 
It could be said that the students who were engaged in social sciences almost     
-P-A-G-E-195
      “CONGRESS OF SECONDARY AND SUPERIOR EDUCATION. 167_ 
always followed the courses in several faculties, and most of these considered sub- 
~ stantial judicial knowledge to be the indispensable foundation for these studies, 
which are crowned by a special doctor’s degree in political sciences. 
M. Georges Hulin followed these declarations by indicating the number of courses 
made in various cities, particularly at Berlin. It seemed to him that a majority of» 
the students considered these studies as an addition to other studies and pursued a * 
disinterested work, é 
Prof. Van Der Rést enter tained us with a project recently: fia pied by the University 
of Brussels, where education in the social sciences was to be established by TEED S ay 
appeal to the professors of all the faculties. 
The investigation to which the president invited the members of the section was _ 
therefore very interesting and instructive, and of a nature to prepare for the solu- 
tion of the grave problem propounded to us. 
On the last three paragraphs we could do no more, however, than to formulate 
(on the proposition of M. Dreyfus-Brisac) the, following view: “The section is of 
opinion that there is room to give a larger place in the courses of superior education — 
to studies in economié and political sciences than has been given to them in the 
ast.” 
. The trouble in arriving at a more precise solution was owing to the ‘existing diffi- 
culty of defining the expression ‘social sciences,” where all that touched upon the 
history of the development and study of the constitution of human societies could 
be embraced. - ja 
Farther, the question submitted to the deliberation of the section was put in 
spocial terms a little delicate for France, and perhaps for that reason the number 
taking part was less numerous and the discussions were more timid. 
M. Van Der Rest also protested energetically against a passage in M. Boutmy’s 
report (page 59), declaring that political economy had no right beyond that limited : 
to special reports, almost sterile for itself, and not Very fruitful for the other group 
of science. 
Prof. Urechia gave some details of the effort attempted in Roumania. Recently in 
that country a free school of social sciences had been created, largely taught by 
professors of law, assisted by young Roumanian doctors or foreigners. This school 
delivered no diploma, but only a certificate of completion. The Government always — 
accorded the preference in appointments to the young men who were graduated 
from that school. Various propositions were made without reaching a vote,some a 
little distrustful concerning university education Gwithout distinction of country), 
preferring the creation of special schools. It was pelieved, at least, that only oe 
schools could give education in social sciences a truly practieal character. 
Others, on the contrary, thought that the university frameworks should ‘soa 3 
larged so as-to afford hospitality to new courses of study. These courses were 
too numerous and too varied to find place in the programme of our faculties of 
law. It was necessary to make appeal to professors belonging to different fac- 
ulties. Some members of the congress seemed inclined toward the creation of a — 
special faculty, such as existed in Munich and Tubingen. But are social sciences 
constituted sufficiently solid and clearly enough defined to warrant the easy accept- 
ance of this solution; and besides, is augmentation of the number of faculties 
desirable? ‘ 
In the brief space of time placed at its disposal the section was not able to reach ~ 
precise conclusion on these diverse points. It has, therefore, confined itself to the 
general view which I have had the honor to present. But before separating, the 
section felt it incumbent to testify to its president, M. Bufnoir, the expression of 
its gratitude for the zeal he has displayed, and the ability with which he has di-_ 
rected the debates.—G, BLONDEL, Reporter.

SEcTION OF SECONDARY EpvucATION. 
OF THE PART TO GIVE SCIENCES IN THE SECONDARY EDUCATION OF YOUNG GIRLS, 
_ Mr. PRESIDENT, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN: At the inauguration of the delibera- 
_ tion on this subject a general question was proposed: Ought young girls to be 
taught all they can learn? And since they are recognized to be as apt as their 
* brothers in the same studies, should they be admitted to the same school to receive 
instruction in common? 
Should, on the contrary, account be taken of the differences of Eanpeeeen and 
‘of vocation, and an outline drawn of studies particular to the feminine sex? The 
section of congress in the name of which we speak is agreed not to erect any barrier, 
and to open widely the doors of the universities; the young girls who cultivate 
their aptitudes will go there to win their degrees, and we believe that we can de- 
pend upon their good sense for the use they will make of them. 
But this superior education will never be demanded except by a few pupils; the 
larger part leave the colleges and lycées at the age of 16 and reénter their fam- 
' ilies to which they are soon called by other duties. “This consideration and that of 
health; and of the delicate physique and morale of the pupil, have led the majority 
to ddupt the second of the two systems; to give young girls an appropriate educa- 
tion which will clear their minds, leaving nothing vague, and rendering them stronger 
and more intelligent, prepare them to fill their places in society. _ 
Our assembly was thus led to select from the sciences those which could serve to 
attain this end, but without ever disproportioning the effort and the force of the 
pupil. 
Thus we urge mathematics for disciplining the mind and initiating in method. 
Algebra, which simplifies the difficult questions of arithmetic, raises education from 
the particular to the general, and gives precision to the other sciences; geometry, 
aecustoms one to see and to reason justly. It is the bond between the abstract 
sciences and the arts; cosmography brings clearness to geographical studies and » 
interests the pupil in the fine order of the universe. \ 
“These three sciences will take their place in our education, and we will answer? 
the questions propounded in the report of M. Darboux, in proposing to the congress 
the adoption of the following conclusions: 
First. It is good to give young girls in the lycées lessons in algebra to elevate 
the standard of the education they receive, and because in certain cases, notably in 
arithmetic, algebra constitutes a simplification. 
Second. Education in geometry should aim at development of the mind; the pro- 
fessor will interest the majority of the pupils in it, provided, its application is shown 
as soon as possible. 
Third. The division of cosmography into two parts—one attaching to geography, 
the other explaining the appearance of celestial phenomena—should be maintained. : 
These conclusions being adopted, the method for instruction in the physical 
~ Sciences and the choice of persons to teach it were prescribed. The method should 
be inductive and experimental, permitting initiation of the pupil into all the 
branches of physics, notwithstanding they now comprise many distinct sciences. 
_ The limits will be reached only when one can not with their aid forsee or verify 
results. Mathematical demonstrations should be necessarily proscribed, and all 
theory beyond the ability of young intelligences should be carefully discarded. 
The only conclusion to present to the congress is that which best expresses the 
following thought: 
“Education in the sciences should, above all, be experimental.” 
‘The science preferred by young girls is natural history. Study of animals and 
plants excites their curiosity and develops their faculty for observation, while 
knowledge of the human frame appeals to their minds and hearts. Hygiene is an $ 
addition to these physiologioat studies, and so far from SD eeacuie it we ask the con-

gress to approve in a last conclusion that ‘hygiene should always be connected 
with the natural sciences, of which it is the application.”—Madame Mourcugs, 
Reporter. 
OF THE METHOD TO FOLLOW IN SECONDARY INSTRUCTION FOR EDUCATION IN THE 
LIVING LANGUAGES. 
Discussion was had on the report of M. Bossert on the method to follow for teach- 
ing living languages in the secondary establishments for young girls. The majority 
of the congress were of opinion: First, that practical education in living languages 
should commence as early as possible; second, theoretic education should be de- 
ferred until the first elements of grammar in the maternal languages shall have been 
acquired. 
I. Practical education should commence early. First, the child becomes familiar 
with strange sounds, and easily learns the pronunciation of strange words; second, 
the study of vocabularies, which Miss Beale justly called the gymnastics of the 
language, is made without much effort after constant repetition, and in due time the 
child will learn well. 
This practical teaching should, above all, be oral. The pupil will learn to talk, 
being accustomed to hear a foreign language spoken. However, it is evident that 
it becomes necessary to give the pupil certain grammatical ideas, without which she 
ean not talk correctly. Bnt it takes time, much time, for this. It is necessary in 
our establishments of secondary instruction to teach English or German as soon as 
possible, say at tho age of 8 or 9 years. It is also necessary, and the professors of 
languages will demand it before long, to devote at least a half hour each day to the 
study of a foreign language by the elementary classes. This will only be two hours 
and a half per week, while in England and the United States six hours a week are 
devoted to the study of living languages. 
II. Theoretic education, properly called—that is to say, the study of syntax, of 
comparative grammar, and the study of foreign literatures—should be entered upon 
assoon as the pupils have learned to express themselves with more or less facility, say 
at the age of 12 or 13 years, when, for example, they have surmounted the elemen- 
tary difficulties of their own language. Theoretic education starting at that age 
should be employed largely in the study of living languages. It does not suffice, in 
effect, only to take one or more foreign languages. The study of languages should 
not have simply a practical aim. It should be a means of education; it should de- 
velop intelligence, elevate the soul, and enlarge the circle of information. It should 
replace, for young girls, the study of the dead languages. By comparative gram- 
mar they learn the grammar of their maternal language better. By translation 
they become accustomed to express new ideas in their own language. By exer- 
cises they apply the rules of syntax. Besides, it becomes necessary, selecting by. 
preference from the modern authors, to initiate young girls into the chief works of 
foreign literatures, especially those who have acquired sufficient maturity of mind 
and a knowledge of the foreign language sufficiently profound to comprehend their 
beauties and their delicacy. 
In almost all countries pupils study two or more foreign languages, while in France 
either English or German is studied. If instruction in the living languages com- 
menced earlier we could, after three or four years of study, teach a second language 
without in the meantime neglecting'the first; besides, many pupils study a second 
language at home because they can not learn it at the lycée. 
Further, we say that practical education and theoretic education each possesses 
_ particular importance. Practical education, addressing itself rather to the memory, 
to the versatility and flexibility of the organs, should precede theoretic education, 
which calls in play the faculties of reasoning and analysis. 
But (and allagree on this point) study of languages will be truly fruitful only where 
itis made attractive, so that on leaving our schools’ pupils may continue to read 
     
-P-A-G-E-198
studied, as do those of our pupils who pass their vacation in England or the foreigners 
who come in large numbers each year to study our language and our literature.— 
Madame Soutr, Meporter. 
OF THE VARIOUS FORMS OF SECONDARY EDUCATION, WHAT SHARE IN THE CLASSIC 
LANGUAGES, THE MODERN LANGUAGES, AND THE SCIENCES IS SUITABLE TO EACH?    
Before entering upon the study of the forms of henddy education we are con- 
fronted with a preliminary question as ‘to the age at which we showld commence 
_ to give secondary classic instruction, so called, comprehending the study of ancient 
- languages. Prof, Herzen proposed that this “union between primary and secondary 
education should take place only at the age of 14 completed.” He saw here “a 
triple interest, pedagogic, individual, and social.” The instruction should be given 
to selected pupils only, concerning whom time had been afforded to make a very 
thorough intelectual examination such as is practiced at the College of the City of 
New York. By this means the professors, dealing with the more mature pupils, taught 
- more readily and with greater chance of success. This was the pedagogic interest. 
They would have only capable and choize pupils and therefore the more docile and 
studious. This was the individual interest. The “no accounts” thus eliminated 
from the classic education would be directed toward their true path, toward more 
practical studies. This was the social interest. / 
A large majority of the congress endorsed the opinion of M. Bréal, that the system 
commended by M. Herzen would lead to overpnencut after the age of 14. Al- 
~ ready, in France where the study of Latin is no longer commenced before the age of 
~ 11 or 12 years, there is connection between this crowding of the of ancient languages 
and overpressure. It is because they managed to contract these studies into a less 
_ number of years that this surcharge is produced. In deferring these studies until 
the age of 14 years, the overpressure will be augmented. The majority agreed 
also, with M. Croiset, that Greco-Latin studies, to be fruitful, should be con- 
ducted more leisurely. In this way only the pupil will read the authors, and enter 
by direct and prolonged contact into the understanding of ancient ideas. Since 
these studies are not to be commenced before the age of 11 or 12 years, their force 
has diminished; what would it be if retarded until the age of 14? Finally, MM. 
Harlaux and Hurdebise demonstrated that the selection proposed would, in con- 
Sequence, operate in many countries to transfer the eliminated pupils into the private 
schools, where they would find the classic culture which had been denied them by 
the State. This would result in diminishing public education. 
This being settled, the following principle was pronounced without contest: 
“It is proper to recognize and in consequence to establish several forms of sec- 
~ .ondary education.” 
  Under this principle, we agreed to recognize a certain number of forms and to - 
mark their general character. We commenced by the less modern form, the most 
elevated, that which rests upon education in thetwolanguages. The necessity was 
understood and expressed in these terms: It is proper to maintain simultaneous and 
obligatory Greco-Latin education. s 
The majority rejected the idea ofa facultative Greek education proposed by M. 
Herzen. It declared that all facultative education isa balance given to overpressure, 
if it finds followers, and the chances are against finding them; besides, a pupil well 
endowed, succecding in Latin has no reason for not succeeding in Greek, so long as 
count is taken of the somewhat greater difficulty attaching to the latter language. 
(See résumé of M. Croiset.) Other reasons were also given. ‘We are unable to 
_ discard the Greek from any true classic education,” said Prof. Stanley, “since the 
aim of classic education should be to develop the mind in attaching the filiation of 
ideas and the progress of civilization to their Greco-Latin stock. Tor the ideas and

form of classic literature, that which emanates from Greece is not only of great value, 
but is also the origin of that which is transmitted to us by means of the Roman — 
civilization.” “ We can not,” said M. Cart, “teach Greek facultatively in the same. 
establishment, for Latin can not be taught to those who pursue the Greek studies in 
the same fashion as to those who omit Greek.” ig 
We subsequently defined a second type of education, founded on the study of a 
single ancient language, specially intended for young men who seek scientific careers. 
On the choice of a single ancient language the partisans of the Latin were not put — 
to the trouble of obtaining precedence for their cause. A lycée of purely Greek 
type, proposed by M. Basiadis, had no success with the majority of the countries, 
“They contemplated in Germany,” said M. Erkelenz, “ making an examination, but 
never had they dared to go as far'as the execution.” Briefly, the following principle 
was adopted: 
It is proper to admit a second form of secondary instruction where but one lan- 
guage, the Latin, is studied.* } 
In the designation of this form of education the word “ classic” was suppressed. 
This suppression was the almost necessary consequence of the remark of Mr. Stan- 
ley onthe classic value of Greek, already cited; and by this is made known definitely 
the desire to see the word ‘‘classic” applied to the first form in the official pro- 
grammes. Incidentally, and in further’ considering the terminology of studies, the 
opinion was expressed that the word “humanities” suited two forms, which are to — 
be defined, whether it be desired to call them, as in Belgium, ‘ Graeco-Latinhumani- _ 
ties and Latin humanities,” or whether they are given, as at first, the name of “classic 
humanities.” But this term “humanities,” of wholly Latin origin and idea, should 
not in any case be applied to an education which did not allow the study of any 
ancient language. 
Without leaving the two forms of education, of which the characters were sought — 
to be established, the proportion of the living languages and sciences suitable for 
each was considered. For the sciences and in the sciences, for pupils seeking scien- 
tific careers, everybody accepted the ideas expressed by M. Croiset in his preparatory — 
report. ‘To prolong the period of literary studies,” said he, ‘is to prolong the period 
of culture generally and widely; it is to keep back the time when absorbing special- 
ties shall dominate; it is to lead to the study of sciences, minds more mature, moro 
open, more supple and better prepared to understand them well.” 
For pupils intended for literature, everybody recognized, with M. Croiset, that 
“the sciences address themselves to certain intellectual faculties which should receive 
a sufficient culture and exercise on the part of all pupils.” We have, therefore, pro- 
nounced in the following terms: In one or the other of the two types of secondary 
education already recognized, the study of sciences, always being subordinated to 
the study of literature, should be made seriously—that is to say, in a slow, gradual, 
and methodical manner; for pupils intended for scientific careers, the separation, 
and consequently the specialization, should be made as late as possible. 
  
*In the course of the discussion on the second type of education, M. Bréal made an 
observation as to detail, which did not call for vote of the Congress, but to which — 
its importance obliges us to refer. As he said, the idea of this education is good, but 
it is necessary to examine well how we can create it. First, for the very purpose, i 
ex nihilo, we announce to families the opening of ican wheré we teach 
only Latin, French, the living languages, and the sciences; this will be the best 
mode of procedure. Second, addition would be madeof Latin to the courses now de- 
prived of it, as our secondary special course which is @ most difficult matter, Third, — 
by retrenchment, establishments of the Greco-Latin type will be chosen, and it will 
be said, “from to-day, the Greek will besuppressed here ;” a dangerous proceeding, for 
like establishments will consider themselves attacked; Latin will here be com- 
promised, and the personnel will find themselves belittled and become discouraged ; 
the experiment will not succeed,

      172 - .. EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
On the question of living languages the following formula was finally agreed upon: 
It is proper to teach the living languages practically to elementary classes, but in 
a more literary method to superior classes. 
On this point it was clear that the more the pupil develops and interests himself 
in the ideas of the Greeks and Romans (in a word their literary life) the more is he 
-in the way of claiming an analogous interest in the living languages. But when 
should this begin? To a proposition of M. Gauthiot, which aimed to put back 
to the farthest the inauguration of these studies, upon the reasoning that the pupils 
would retain only that which they had'learned at the close of the teaching, the 
answer was made: The study of the living languages must not give way for one- 
half of the classic studies with the view of doubling the hours which will be devoted 
_ to the former in the superior classes. Are we sure, in effect, that the pupil for- 
gets so quickly? Being younger, does he not possess more facility to retain the 
words in his memory and to pronounce them correctly, thanks to greater suppleness 
of his organs? It remained to specify that which is understood by practical teaching. 
Two opinions were presented ; some, considering that reading was the most elevated 
aim, relegated to the second place the art of writing and speaking. They agreed 
with M. Rabier that reading was the more important usage, more fruitful from the 
intellectual point of view and likewise from the practical standpoint. By reading 
_ one becomes acquainted with books, reviews, newspapers, and allthatconcernsthe lit- 
erary, scientific, or commercial movement of a people. In life one finds the occasion, 
the desire, or the duty to read more frequently than to write. Others contended, 
with M. Bréal, that the possession of a living language should be active, that the 
use of the theme or the version is often exaggerated, that the best professor is he 
who does not pronounce before his pupils a word of their native language. From 
the international standpoint it is certain, contended M. Bréal, that students ac- 
customed to talk during their sojourn at the lycée, will acquire a desire to perfect 
themselves in the foreign language, not alone to make themselves better understood 
by a hotel proprietor or a guide, but to follow with profit the university courses, 
chat with the masters, and generally with all those persons acquainted with the 
country in which they travel. These two opinions could be reconciled, and were 
summed up by Vice-Rector Gréard in the following formula, which was adopted: 
There are two things necessary to acquire in the study of living languages—the 
possession of a language and the most elevated literary intelligence. 
Finally, a third type of secondary education was recognized, to which was given the 
name of modern secondary education, which is treated in the preparatory report of M. 
Croiset. That which has been said concerning the name of the two other types ex- 
plains in part the reasons why these terms have been adopted for the third; further- 
more, it is an education excluding the ancient languages, therefore admitting the 
modern, and, as was correctly written by M. Croiset, “professing, however, to be an 
education truly secondary, namely, having in view the harmonious and disinterested 
culture of the mind.” This commentary was adopted on all sides, and this being 
settled, trouble was not taken to formulate more detailed conclusions. Besides, the 
discussion on the two first types had previously cleared the ground. In consequence, 
responding to the questions contained in the report of M. Croiset, we were able to 
adopt, almost without discussion, the following three principles: 
First. This education should at the same time be literary and scientific. 
Second. There is no room to make place in it for Latin. 
Third. There is-room to make instruction in living languages more important aid 
more literary than it actually is. 
In insisting on these words, “important” and “literary,” we wanted to show that, 
without neglecting the practical side, we desired that the study of living languages 
should elevate the intelligence and the heart of young men and render modern ae 
cation more attractive.—EGGER, Reporter.

LIMITATION AND SANCTION OF SECONDARY STUDIES (BACCALAUREATE AND CERTIFI 
CATES OF MATURITY). 
i 
On the limitation and sanction of secondary studies, the labors were singularly 
facilitated by the two conclusions of the preliminary report of M. Pigeonneau. In ~ 
consequence, we haye just pronounced on the following formula, which was unani- 
mously adopted without any objection being manifest: 
It is necessary that secondary studies should have a sanction. 
The discussion was next opened on the second conclusion of M. Pigeonneau, thus 
expressed : 
‘The best mode of sanction is that which permits conscientious pupils of average 
intelligence to obtain the final diploma without special preparation, by following 
simply the regular course of studies, 2 
To this, again, there were noobjections. The foreign representatives limited them- 
selves to indicating by various details how, in their countries, they gave like char- 
acter to the sanction. M. Herzen, for example, informed us that in Switzerland at. 
each examination of promotion up to the last. the average of notes obtained during the 
year counted for one-half. The French representatives regretted that this was not 
also done in their country; they showed that this system of sanction was applied 
solely in several special schools (polytechnic, central, nayal, etc.), where the notes 
obtained by the pupil during the year entered legally into line of count and for the 
totality of their numerical value up to ane day of final examination, (Communi- 
cation of M. Chappuis.) 
In short, it was shown that the Lakoaiaarsite was not a competition, but an ex- 
“amination where is contested the right to success for whoever has honestly labored 
and where grave interests for the future of the candidate are involved. This being 
admitted, are all the precautions taken in France? No, and the French baccalaure- 
ate, therefore, constitutes a denial of justice. Fewer precautions are here taken to 
assure justice than in the inferior process before the courts. (Communication of M. 
Rabier.) : 
The second conclusion of Mr. Pigeonneau was therefore adopted after these differ- 
ent remarks. Later, the complementary view of M. Pigeonneau was adopted in the 
following terms: ‘‘ Whatever be the mode of sanction adopted, it is desirable that 
count should be kept for obtaining the final diploma of studies, of anterior marks, and _ 
of the classing of the pupils in the establishment where he has made his studies.” 
Here again no fundamental objections were interposed, but numerous references were 
made to the facilities or difficulties of application of the system in countries follow- 
ing their social and political status according to the degree or the freedom of second- 
ary education there permitted and practiced. Each country would determine what 
value the jury should attach to the information furnished concerning the pupils, and 
to that degree, in the spirit of its legislation, it could realize the view above ex- 
pressed. ” 
It was not deemed desirable to. go farther in the pathway of practical ideas, and 
when M. Blanchet presented the terse opinion that the candidates at examinations 
should be judged by their professors in conjunction with-representatives of the state 
it was not accepted as meriting a vote. This view was declared to be incompatible 
with the resolutions of an international congress which, while limiting itself _to 
generalities, should pronounce only practical conclusions. ‘To emit this view,” said 
M. Dreyfus-Brisac, ‘‘is almost to manufacture politics, for it touches on questions 
of interior order and of local morals, in respect to which the passions of people can 
be, and frequently are, extremely violent.” — 
From the standpoint of an ideal pedagogy, which would set aside political life, 
this view would be excellent, but if it were adopted to-day it would run the risk of 
not being understood in the ideal sense, and that is what must be avoided, For 
example, in France the embarrassment of the legislator would be extremely great.

        e 174 _- EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
Account should be taken of the inequality of studies which exists as well in 
the education of the state as in private education. Certain state colleges would not 
be allowed the right to conduct the examinations for want of possessing a corps 
of professors supplied with degrees and enjoying sufficient authority. Moreover, as 
the colleges are maintained in part by the communes and in part by the principal, 
who assumes the expense for the profit of the boarding department, the deprivation 
_ of the right of examination and the failure of the pupils would engender all sorts of 
recrimination on the part of municipal councils and families. These recriminations 
‘will find echo in the press as well as in parliament, and there would be no doubt that 
_ the presence of the delegate of the state in the juries must suffice at least in France 
(as M. Spruyt appeared to think) to degrade them and make the delegate the scape- 
goat for all the complaints. (Résumé of ideas expressed by MM. Chappuis and 
Himly.) In short, if the principle of the judgment of pupils by their masters were 
permitted we should find ourselyes confronted by a double difficulty, On the one 
hand, the principle would be yielded in requiring pupils of the private schools to 
pass the examination before a jury of the state in which none of their masters would 
be found, and, on the other hand, the influence of the state on their studies would be 
diminished in giving the principle its entire application—that is to say, in con- 
ferring upon the masters of the private schools the right to bestow an official cer- 
tificate upon their pupils. It should be added that in the province of private edu- 
cation there will arise the new difficulty of establishing the distinction between the 
schools deserving to conduct the examination and those which would present too 
few guaranties. We should therefore limit, and we have limited, ourselves in effect 
to the complementary proposition of M. Piggeonneau, which otherwise completely 
satisfied the partisans of examination passed by the pupil before his professors, inas- 
much as the better means of taking account of the past career of a candidate is to 
have him interrogated by those who have seen him at work. In this manner the 
opinion, while holding to the ideal principle, does not seem desirous’ of imposing it. 
It might satisfy a greater number of persons, which certainly is an advantage not 
to be despised. 
A later proposition, presented by MM. Herzen and Pigeonneau, was adopted: ‘The 
Congress expresses the view that the three sanctions permitted for the three types 
- of secondary education should afford access to the different orders of superior stud- 
ies, each one following the nature of the secondary studies which it crowns.” 
It was thought that this opinion thns formulated would not trench upon the domain 
of superior education, and nobody offered objection. Some wished to make it more 
precise, but that would have entered into details of application with which the Con- 
gress could not concern itself. Almost for the same reason, it was not desired 
to examine the question of serious practical tests, proposed by M. Micé, coming 
only after the success of written and oral tests, and selected so as not to take up too 
- much time of the judges and candidates. These tests would have been added in all 
the branches, where the matter permitted to the actual means of appreciating the 
~ worth of candidates in the various baccalaureates. This was a question of special 
character, not very international, and also—a serious objection—of anature to com- 
plicate examinations already sufficiently encumbered as to the subject and the 
tests.—EGGur, Reporter, 
THE INAUGURATION OF THE NEW SORPONNE. 
The new Sorbonne, whose buildings spread over a vast rectangle comprised 
within the Street of the Schools, Saint Jacques street, Cujas street, and Sorbonne 
street, is divided into three parts—the Academy of Paris, the Faculty of Letters, and 
the Faculty of Sciences. The last is in course of erection, and the walls are already 
rising from the ground. . The second, in which will be included the actual church, 
willoceupy the site of the old Sorbonne, and has not yet been commenced. The 
 
-P-A-G-E-203
  first, which is almost finished, occupies nearly an entire square with a monumental 
frontage on the Street of the Schools. 
The ceremony of inauguration took place in this new amphitheater, which con- 
tains 3,000 seats. An immense red carpet covered the floor of the platform, upon 
which 112 red and gold sofas were arranged. The middle gallery, reserved for 
Madame Carnot and her guests, was decorated in a special manner. The first row 
of benches was occupied by the rectors and deans of the five faculties, in grand cos- 
tumes. Behind them were seated the members of the general council of the fac- 
ulties of Paris, 2 delegation of councilors-general and faculties from the provinces, 
the professors of the faculties of Paris, the professors of eleven lycées of Paris” 
and Versailles, deputations from the Museum, the College of France, the Superior 
Normal School, the School of High Studies, the School of Oriental Languages, and

In the galleries were senators, deputies, and municipal councilors. All about the 
amphitheater were student carriers of banners, tricolors and various other flags 
representing the universities and the nationalties. 
At precisely 3 o’clock M. Carnot arrived accompanied by his ministers and the 
officers of his military establishment. ATI the audience rose and saluted him with — 
_ long and enthusiastic acclamations. At the right of the President of the Republic, 
taking their place on the platform, were MM. Spuller, minister for foreign affairs; 
Rouvier, Le Royer, Barbier, president of the Court of Cassation; Poubelle, prefect ‘of 
the Seine, and Jules Simon. At his left were MM. Fallitres, minister of public 
instruction; Admiral Krantz, minister of the navy; Lord Lytton, ambassador from 
England; Gen. Menabrea, ambassador from Italy; Chautemps, president of the 
municipal council, and Jules Ferry. The other sofas were occupied by MM. Jac= 
ques, president of the general council; Lozé, prefect of police; Léon Say, Pasteur, 
Comte, Liard, director ofsuperior education; Rabier, director of secondary education; 
Buisson, director of primary education; Alphand, Cochery, prefect of Seine-and-

Viscount Delaborde, Guillaume, Bailly, Chapu, Hémard, Zeller, Chaplain, Cariot, 
and others. A warm ovation was given M. Jules Ferry upon his entrance, and a 
_ little later to M. Duruy. 
After hearing the discourses, which were warmly applauded, all the audience 
listened to the rendition of the Marseillaise.- A great enthusiasm reigned among the 
students, who, in the midst of cries of “Long live Carnot! Long live France! Long 
live the Republic!” took up in chorus the national hymn and saluted the march of ~ 
the professors by copious stamping. 
The President of the Republic, followed by M. Gréard and his ministers, then re- 
paired to the council hall, where lunch had been prepared. In leaving the Sorbonne 
_ he handed the academic palms to M. Chaumeton, president of the Students’ Gen-' 
eral Association. The excited students immediately formed in procession and de- 
filed, banners flying, before M. Carnot, who responded by salute to their acclamations. — 
In the ovening a brilliant reception brought together, at the house of the minister 
of public instruction, notabilities of the political and university world, and repre- 
sentatives of the youth of the French and foreign schools. All those who assisted at 
this beautiful entertainment will retain profound recollection of it. It is well to be 
able, thanks to the effects of culture, thus to prove that a very ardent patriotic en- 
thusiasm can be allied to the sincerest sentiments of international fraternity.

176 EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
Republic whom we recognize and proudly salute in this rotunda, It is the inheritor 
of a name dear to science and education; it is the man who, elevated to the utter- 
most by public estimation, personifies France in his uprightenss and his loyalty. 
Four years have elapsed since the placing of the first stone of the Sorbonne, restored 
and enlarged. We expressed the hope, day by day, that the centenary of 1789 would 
chronicle its inauguration. Thanks to the remarkable diligence with which the 
work has been conducted, we are ready. And among the gratifications which we 
owe to this happy consummation, can I omit this gathering, so distinguished by repre- 
sentatives of foreign universities? Seizing the occasion of the Universal Exposition 
and its congresses, they had the good will to unite themselves here with the delega- 
tions from French universities. Let them be assured that we realize the full value of 
these pledges of confraternity. 
One of the first in date, if not the first, the University of Paris in the Middle 
Ages was without contradiction the most renowned and the most hospitable of all. 
~ The scholars of the times who in the search of origins prided themselves less upon 
exactitude than imagination, considered it by right of inheritance the sovereign 
depository of the treasuries of science. The university frem which all the others de- 
scended, wrote Bishop Tilon de Mersebourg, is that of Babylon, founded by Ninus; 
to Babylon succeeded the city of the Pharaohs, Memphis; to Memphis, Athens, the 
work of Cecrops; from Athens, Rome, and from Rome, Paris. Bologne is entitled 
justly to credit for education in jurisprudence; none will contest the supremacy 
of the University of Paris in sacred and profano literature. Ten colleges were 
grouped about it as about the common mother—college of ‘“‘Dennemarche,” the 
- English college; the Scotch college, the German, the Lombard, and the Greeks. Kings 
sent their sons hither to form them in the dialect and good manners. From the 
thirteenth to the sixteenth centuries it contributed to the elevation of the greater 
part of mankind, poets, savants, and philosophers, coming from all known sections 
of the world, of whom posterity has preserved the memory or consecrated the name— 
William Occam, the “invincible doctor,” Raymond Lulli, Thomas Aquinas, Benoit 
of Anagni, the embryo Boniface the Eighth, Brunetto Latini, one of Dante’s mas 
' ters, Dante himself, Thomas Morus, Erasmus, and many others. Oh, unique city! 
Oh, Paris without equal! Parisius sine pari! wrote Lanfranc, of Milan, in separat- 
ing himself from his companions of study. They loved “the delectable speech” 
which resounded in “this gentle land of university blessed by God.” ‘They felt 
everywhere at their ease, because, by the unanimous testimony of those who met 
them here, love of truth was the sole rule which characterized the discipline of the 
teaching and which each of his right enjoyed. It is not rash to say it, at a timo 
when all the intellectual life was inclosed within the walls of the schools, the Uni- 
versity of Paris was the most active propaganda center of the spirit of France, 
On all sides to-day are celebrated the manifestations of the French mind in the fine 
arts, agriculture, commerce, andindustry. Is not here, more particularly, the feast 
of the French mind itself, that which it has accomplished, with the endowments of 
therace, the education of centuries; the mingling of sentiment and of reason, of grace 
and force, at once bold and circumspect, free and ordained, expansive among all, 
and profoundly human, ardent champion of noble causes, which touch it near or far, 
sometimes at their cost; imposing only contidence upon others in seeking to pardon 
its transitory violences by its durable benefits? 
In the Middle Ages it was the French spirit which first inspired and almost wholly 
_ sustained to the end the impetuosity of the Crusades, gave to religious enthusiasm 
its full scope and at the same time opened new paths to the activity of the peoples of 
the Occident.. It was the French spirit which at the end of a centenary conflict re- 
covered the sense of country, realized it in a valiant and touching image, and by an 
effort which politics could but consecrate, set the bases of national unity. If it re- 
ceived from without the breath of the ‘‘reform” and of the “renaissance,” with what

vigor it appropriated and converted it tothe highest aspirations! What awakening 
of ‘antiquity, rejuvenated and purified by Christianity, was the opening of French 
literature in the seventeenth century, an expansion so rich and so brilliant that even 
after the luster of military glory, for so many years undimmed, was extinguished 
this century, although desolated at its end, preserved for contemporaneous BEOELS as . 
well as for posterity the radiant name of Louis the Fourteenth! 
On the other hand, what. power in the current philosophy which, traversing with- 
out losing itself, that hierarchised and pacificated society, nought back to light in 
the first years of the century of Voltaire and Montesquieu, all the controversies of 
freo examination, and with them the ideas thenceforth imperishable, of religious 
tolerance and social equity, of law and humanity! In fine, has the soul of a peo- 
ple ever found a more generous expression of the work of intellectual and moral _ 
emancipation accomplished by itself than the principles of 1789, which became as the 
charter of civilized nations? 
These legacies of the past impose great duties upon the century which achieved 
them. It has not here failed. Memorable events were accomplished, often illus- 
trious, sometimes painfully disturbed in their course. It has*known the exultations 
of victory and the extremtties of defeat. It has seen all the forms of monarchy 
crumble, and established on their ruins the popular power armed by universal suf- 
frage. Nota single question, political, economic, religious, which may not beraised 
to-day. of which the discussion does not project its doubts with its lights on the _ 
foundation of social organization. But if at no time, perhaps, more press- 
ing, formidable problems have been submitted to public reason, it seems that 
at no time, either, has the activity of the French mind been more intense or more 
fruitful. Philosophy searching all the mysteries of its own being and thought; 
poesy dipping into the sources of nature and the deepest emotions of the soul; his- 
tory revived by the impartial and sagacious study of documents and texts; public 
and private law, each day more cpen to the mind of modern democracy, lending 
its force to the relief of the humble and the protection of the woak; science, 
    ‘prilliant in wonders, elevating by the power of calculation the knowledge of an 
invisible world, penetrating by the subtlety of analysis the secrets of life, lavishing 
its treasures upon industry; all the sentiments, all the passions are scarched and 
laid bare at the theater, in romance, and in literary criticism; by the observation 
of a trenchant psychology as pitiless as the scalpel—happy if, sometimes, it did not 
seem to neglect art through excess of fidelity; the language itself put back into the 
erucible, fortified, stimulated, and fashioned to interpret with energy or delicacy 
in their most diverse shadings, the ideas which possess us. Here among the embar- 
rassments and the inseparable obscurities of all social evolution, here is the heritage 
resting upon names destined to live, that our age in its turn is, in its mature years, 
to transmit to the future. ee 
Young man, this future belongs to you, and it is you who will make it. More 
favored than your elders, nothing is spared that you may prepare to pay your debt 
to humanity and at the same time to your country. That in which France was in 
default before 1789, wrote Guizot in 1815, was a superior instruetion which would 
have permitted the direction of the revolution, if not its prevention. To-day, the 
chairs are not wanting for teachings nor masters for the chairs, nor power of knowl- 
‘edge and talent for those who fill them. Do not forget, my friends, that these 
precious resources were created and multiplied for you. Work to become capable, 
and show yourselves worthy to receive the benefits. Whether pressed by the neces- 
sities of life you have time to acquire only a professional education, or whether the 
ambition seizes you to become teachers yourselves, maintain and propagate the tra- 
ditions of the French mind. Carry high the object of your thoughts; lore science, 
for it is a-wise counselor. This is a school of sincerity and respect. Like religion, 
it has its apostles and its martyrs. It inspires self-sacrifice, it prepares for all 
duties; and between those which it brings together this day, in the sentiment of a

by those students, your comrades, from all countries who have responded to your 
appeal), it establishes the bonds of a common country. © 
After this much applauded address, M. Hermitte, professor at the Faculty of Sci- 
nees, delivered a very learned discourse, which was well received by the specialists. 
who heard it. The subject treated by this eminent professor was ‘The labors of 
cee she professors. in mathematical education at the Sorbonne.” 
es ~ Subsequently, M. Chautemps, president of the municipal council, in the name of 
he city, made delivery of the monument to the state. He explained that the new 
Sorbonne is constructed at the joint cost of the city of Paris and of the state. 
x Discoursr or M. CHAUTEMPs. 
-Mr.Prusmeyt or ran Rerusiic AND GENTLEMEN: I cannot repress my genu- 
ine emotion in speaking at this ceremony, in the midst of the most eminent men of 
ideas in the world, and in this new and magnificent temple which the Republic has 
just erected to-science, on the same spot where all the intellectual past of our 
ountry is in some measure synthesized. 
‘The impression we experience here is that of sab doi respect, and it would be a 
great wrong were the democracy accused of haying banished from itself this ele- 
_ yated sentiment. Disdainful of the pretensions of fortune and of birth, it bows be- 
fore science andis the first to recognize the beneficent sovereignty of savants and 
_ thinkers, who are least disposed to suffer another domination. 
And a republican, should he not be moved by the spectacle which is now presented 
to our eyes, and which evokes the memory of all those illustrious men, savants, phi- 
losphers, historians, and poets, whose struggles for the liberation of thought haye 
slowly brought humanity to the consciousness of its rights, and whom it is just to 
salute this day as the remote precursors of the Revolution, ahs centenary of which 
-we celebrate. ~ 
_ But it is not for me to speak here in the name of the Univ: ersity of France, to re-- 
es its glorious history, and to give utterance to the hopes already justified by 
_ these great things accomplished, which it desires to found on the Republic. 
The réle of president of the municipal council is more modest. To affirm before 
‘you tho interest taken in the cause of superior education by the representatives of 
-the Parisian people would be a superfluous task. The sacrifices made for the recon- 
struction of the Sorbonne are, in this respect, the most eloquent of discourses. They 
_say sufficiently that to our cyes the power and the prosperity of the country are in- 
timately bound to the lot it bestows upon its savants, its writers, and its artists, and 
_ “that the funds consecrated to the development of high ideas should not result solely 
in industrial progress, but also in the elevation of the moral and intellectual standard 
of the whole nation, which increases a hundred fold the worth of the individual, 
_and assures to the people advantage over their rivals. 
Nevertheless, gentlemen, I may be permitted to recall that the municipal council 
‘did not yote without debate the eleven millions which were asked of it, and that it 
was anxious to guarantee from this occasion the progress of private education. The 
Government has entered liberally into our views, and all those who by the merit and. 
the character of their work are warranted in claiming such an honor may in the 
future teach by the side of distinguished masters of the faculties of state. A new 
era is about to be opened for the Sorbonne, not less brilliant, we have the firm hope, 
than those which preceded it. > 
_ But can it be said, gentlemen, that the desires of the municipal council should be 
now satisfied? That would be to ignore the extent of its ambition. Determined 
adversaries of centralization and uniformity, when not imposed by superior neces- 
sities, we nevertheless bear in mind the noble and fruitful rivalry which in certain 
- countries formerly animated neighboring universities, and we have the temerity to

history of the French Revolution, and that of biological philosophy. >. 
The most ardent of our desires is to be shortly placed so as to take advantage’ 
- and utilize, to the profit of high studies, the totality of out good will. 
"But it would be bad grace, gentlemen, to longer discourse of ourselyes in an 
reunion where the larger part of foreign universities are represented by their ost — 
celebrated masters and by theif students. As is science itself, the solemnity o: 
day is international, and this communion of men to~whom, in all countries, the _ 
education of new generations is confided, can but powerfully contribute to the fr 
ternity of peoples and the peace of the world. 
I close, gentlemen, by expressing to the delegates from foreign universities a : 
wishes of welcome to the city of Paris, Gentlemen, I salute your glorious banners!

Mr. PrestpEnt OF THE REPUBLIC AND GENTLEMEN: I shall not dissemble the joy 
and the pride I feel in speaking before such an assembly and on such an occasion, 
This inauguration of the new Sorbonne, celebrated in the centenary year of the ae 
French Revolution, at the side of the Universal Exposition, reuniting from all: points 
in France around the respected chief of the state, the teachers of higher education — 
who create science and the students who receive it in trust, in one intention and — 
purpose, well conceived to gladden French hearts and inspire with a legitimate 
_' pride all those who have contributed to the work of the renewal of our Sane 
education. 4 : 
Of all the works of the Republic there are none more assured of the judgment ‘0 
histoty, for there are none which have responded to wants more real, which have 
been conducted with more method and perseverance and which are inspired ay. 
higher solicitude for the interests of the country. 
That which waswanting (only twenty years ago) in our superior education, hie é 
amid resplendent glories concealed unknown miseries, the coldest among you have 
t not forgotten. I shall not recall it here. These miseries, which a former minister 
pointed out to the indifference of the public powers in the first statistics of superior 
~ education, are now only aremembrance. What good is it torevive it? That which 
we have done suffices for our honor; what need of enhancing it by talking of that — 
which others have not done? 
But that which I should not suppress, is the sureness of instinet with which the : 
~ French democracy, hardly free and master of itself, has recognized in scienco the — 
_ great ancestor always fruitful; the active respect with which it has surrounded 
science; the faith reposed in it; the liberality with which the nation has treated i 
Intent, as it should be upon the instruction of the people, the Republic felt that if 
primary education is a system of canals which distribute, it is not the source which — 
produces, It has had the intuition that science is like the waters, the higher it is_ 
~earried the more force has it to expand and to pengtrate deeply. It has entertained — 
the sentiment that, if it sufficed for monarchies that the national ideal should bethe — 
. gift to afew minds of the élite, in a democracy with sovereignty spread over ai 
that ideal should be bestowed upon all, and for this syork nothing is more valu: 
than history, philosophy, literature, and tho sciences. S 
In order to show that which it has donc under the impuise of these sentiments, it 
   
-P-A-G-E-208
  hecomes necessary, gentlemen, to take up before you, one by one, the budgets of pub- 
_ lic instruction, each year increasing, follow day by day the collective work of all the 
_ ministers whose names y$u know, and who: havo been, without interruption and 
“without faltering, the servitors of the same design. 
‘It is necessary to describe our faculties to you, everywhere reconstructed and en-. _ 
larged, to introduce you to our laboratories, show you the implements thoroughly 
renewed, to glance over our enriched collections and libraries, and take account of 
_ the new courses of instruetion we have created. 
The day will not suffice. Z 
Besides, is not the new Sorbonne the most eloquent of all witnesses? Delayed and 
| promised for half a century, behold that whieh, under the skill of a master architect, 
- erécts its front and roof in the heart of the Latin Quarter, after a purely French 
design, like a metropolis in the midst of our other schools. Behold that which on- 
compasses from two points, the old Sorbonne of Richelicu, on one side the palace, on 
the other the workshop. Behold, all about the little patch of ground where in other 
times stood ‘the very poor house” of Robert de Sorbon, that which displays its mag- 
nificent multiple edifices, adorned by the genius of our artists! 
That which you behold, you owe, gentlemen, to the city of Paris and is the state. 
_ Permit me, in your‘name, to thank the city of Paris, which, prodigal for the pri- 
- mary schools, has not been less generous to our schools of higher education. 
Permit me also to here thank, in the presence and in the name of our reunited fac- 
ulties, the cities of the departments, large and small, Bordeaux, Lyons, Toulouse, 
Montpellier, Lille, Nancy, Caen, Grenoble, Clermont, Rennes, and. Dijon, valiant 
cities which have comprehended their duties toward science, and avhich have all paid 
_ their debt with as much liberality as Paris. 
You, gentlemen, have understood that so much confidence and sacrifice imposes new 
duties, and for fifteen years you have entertained consciousness,each day clearer 
and more active, of your double scientific and social function, 
_ It is a hundred years since the universities of the olden time expired. Long since 
abandoned, as they were, by that living spirit which had formerly made the Uni- 
versity of: Paris.the great light of the Middle Age, they died because they failed to 
recognize the new principle of life in the new mind which, since Descartes’ time, 
has conquered all and possessed all; the sciences of nature after that of mathematics, 
the sciences of man after those of nature. 
The revolution had dreamed of establishing in their place vast encyclopedic 
schools, where all the forces would meet, animated mutually by a harmony com- 
parable to that of the laws of nature and of the faculties of the human mind. This 
admirable programme did not succeed. After three-quarters of a century, you have 
_. Tevived it, gentlemen. _ We resume it with you. 
; By ono of those fatalities which history frequently records, the work of the revo- 
- Iution in the matter of higher education was opposed by its own designs. It had 
_ wished encyclopedic schools, and it left special schools; it had desired to distribute 
_ over the territory a certain number of scientific centers, and it left only that of 
And when the consulate and the Empire completed the rough-hown organization of 
the superior education, that which was done was again the creation of special schools 
under different names, cach one devoted to the culture of one particular science or to 
the preparation of a settled profession, without doubt bound together by the network 
of the administration, but without internal unity, without common soul. 
Nevertheless, our superior education thus constituted has not often failed to 
throw great gleams of light ov the world. We have had this’ lineage of illus- 
trious mathematicians, one of the most celebrated of whom a little while ago, with 
incomparable authority described their immortal works. 
To speak only of the dead and of the greatest among the dead, we have had in 
philosophy, history, languages, literature, and erudition, Cousin, Guizot, Michelet,

Silvestre de Sacy, Abel Rémusat, Villemain, Bournouf, Ozanam, Victor Leclere; in ~ 
physics, Gay-Lussac, Dulong, and Ampere; in chemistry, Dumas, Gerhardt, Sainte-_ 
Claire Deville, and Wurtz; in the sciences, Cuvier, Milne-Edwards, Magendie and 
Claude Bernard. 
But around the geniuses, beneath these great talents, what lack of cohesion, of 
dash, and of action! Thanks to you, gentlemen, it is no longer thus. With the sa- 
gacity and the decision of strong men, you haye yourselves taken the initiative of — 
your reform and your transformaticn. You have here been aided by an administra- 
tion solicitous of its duties toward. the country, and which has applied itself to 
* create agencies proportionate to the necessities as they appeared to you and their 
progress was manifested. From this evolution the phases of which succeed and 
enchain themselves with security, great effects are already visible to the eyes of all. 
It is at first a commencement of scientific decentralization. But lately, too, there 
was an excessive contrast between Paris and the province. About all that enlight- 
ened and vivified was concentrated at Paris. Without doubt Paris rests and will 
remain an incomparable source of science, a unique treasury of knowledge, a 
center of aspiration as well as a focus of expansion and radiation. 
But all around, in the obscure zone that envelops it, we have seen for sometime 
the glitter here and there of luminous points, the intensity of which increases. We 
see universities born aud united, each one with its proper characteristics, with the 
mark of its sphere, the savor of its soil, the promise of 4 well-marked individuality. . 
At the same time a concentration has been effected in the faculties each day more 
binding in its forces. Your companies, gentlemen, have borne the old name of facul- 
  ties for along period; but these faculties were lacking in the varied powers of asingle — 
soul. To-day, affairs are returned to their natural order. You have become bodies, 
and while resting attached to the state, from which you would not wish to be sepa- 
rated any more than the state would consent to be separated from you, you have | 
acquired the functions of bodies. 1 
You are no longer simply juxtaposed one with the other; you have become — 
parts of the same corps, in the life of which you all unite, ea ch after its kind, and if 
this body has not yet received the name which suits it—that name which I'read in- 
scribed on these walls as an appeal and a pledge—be sure that it will not be refused, 
with all that it implies, to the best doer and the most deserving. 
* One of the most salient traits of this metamorphose, one of those which I should 
here notice, because I see with you one of the most precious signs of the times, one 
\-of the most solid reasons for our faith in the future, is the collective conscience which 
has possessed our youth themselves in contact with and under the influence of 
their masters. : 
Before us are our youth. They are grouped here not by accident and for a single 
day; but in durable shape. » They are here, those whom we love, those whom we 
wish should be joyous, intrepid, and deliberate, impassioned for truth, for liberty, 
for justice, and for country, : 
You, gentlemen, are the select of the nation. In your time you will soon have 
charge of the country. We confide to you, as a guard of honor, the trust of the 
genius of France. aC day you will receive it, piece by piece, from the lessons of 
your masters. = 
Your first.duty should be not to desert it, nor diminish, nor alter; you should also 
develop and enlarge. You are the sons of a country where a long history has sown 
deep-rooted seeds of division. 
You are coming td the age of manhood and to public life at the moment when — 
powerful nations are formed around us, animated by redoubtable emulation, 
Well may you say, then; that this soul of France, placed-in your soul, will strive 
to end quarrels and divisions, and that you will supply the means to have done with 
them. Take count of that which contains the moral sentiments and ideas, honor, 
justice, liberty, tolerance, and respect of human person, and tell me if there be not

Again, well may you say, that this soul of France, your safeguard from within, 
;also one of your forces from without. It teaches you that from the womb of na- 
ionsis delivered a harmony of sentiments and ideas which establish above them 
the sense of humanity. This consciousness is not the exclusive work of any one 
ation, but all have tho right to claim a part. The portion which comes to your 
country is neither small nor perishable. In the air that all civilized men breathe, 
__- there is something contained of France. Not in vain has she given the world this’ 
double reyelation—the Discourse of method and the Declaration of human rights. 
This radiance beyond our borders has made ours ascendant for a long period. For 
this we ought to be again to-day something more than a weight or a counterpoise in 
jhe unstable equilibrium of peoples. 
You owe to this a renewal of grandeur and of distinction. 
There is, do not forget it, a force all the more powerful because it acts by at- 
traction.. This force will serve to make you love your country; strive to gain 
earts for France, and let the first gained be those of these young men, your com-.

N STU Ts: Rabelais, of whom you are to-day the parishioners, has fore- 
told our celebration in very clear terms, “‘The noble Kingdom of France will prosper 
nd triumpli this year in all pleasures and delights to such extent that the foreign 
ations will flock to it. Small banquets, small sports, a thousand joyousnesses will ~ 
here be had where each one will take his pleasure.” 80 spoke the curate of Meudon, 
in chapter six of Pantagruélien Prognostication. With that irony which the prophets — 
ten employed he said, with admirable euphemism, ‘small banquets,” for, on the day 
of the inauguration of the Sorbonne, you drank 1,300 bottles of champagne (counting 
nly in this estimate the official bottles). Your sports have not been smaller than 
-your banquets, and I congratulate you, gentlemen, in the name of the honorary 
members of the general association, old students, who are not those who study the 
Teast, ‘grave persons, who love the young and, their youth having passed, know that 
"your youth must pass in time. 
‘The “delights” have not been stinted for you.’ The ciiy and the state have 
given you this evening’s entertainment, and you: have enjoy ed the entertainment 
of the minister of public instruction, of the minister of puwblic works, the 
opera, and the feast at the city hotel, Spontaneously the administrator and the as- 
sociates of the French comedy thought that the hospitality of France would be in- 
complete if the authorized interpreters of our great dramatic writers did not accord 
you the honors of the genius of Corneille and of Molitre. M. Clarctie bade you 
welcome in poetic verses replete with high sentiments of patriotism and of human-_ 
ity.” The house of Moliére furnished you with a princely entertainment. Finally, : 
for the ‘first time, you haye left Paris to como hither. My friend, the mayor of 
Meudon, desired to receive you like kings; he has harangued you with the accom- 
paniment of his flourish of trumpets, and provoked somewhat the jealousy of His 
Majesty the Shah of Persia. Iam not astonished that he has left.

Four years ago the first stone of the Sorbonne was laid with grand ceremony. 
No student was invited. The Sorbonne has now been inaugurated. The presiden 
of the Republic presided, surrounded by ministers, embassadors, and members Of 
the Institute. The University was represented by its counsellors, its rectors, an 
the professors of its universities, colleges, and schools. Who were the heroes o 
this celebration? Next to the president of the Republic they were tho students. - 
We had thrown the ermine about our shoulders, we had put on-our robes which — 
sang all the gamnt of the heavenly arch; we were made up yery fine; but, poor 
seniors that we are, the glances were for ‘the velvet caps, for the bonnets fringe 
_ with silver, for the hats of red satin, the easques with black tassels, the caps with 
the white crests, the sashes of every color, the antique banner, and for these thous 
ands of young faces, upon which were stamped the pharantenisayes of great tranaes

      EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
Young foreigners, in the name of the elder students of France, I salute and thank 
you for having responded to the appeal of your French comrades. You have aided. 
us to revive the days when the University of Paris, the alma mater of all nations, al- 
most sufficed to enlighten the world. The men of that period loved to give concrete 
forms to ideas. They attributed to them domiciles. They said that the popedom   
‘resided at Rome, the empire in Germany, and. science at Paris. Since that time, 
since our University has received the official consecration of its existence, seven cen-° 
- turies have not wholly wasted themselves. There is not much in the interval; it is 
_ a brief moment in the increase of the human race, and yet who shall recognize man 
_and the world from the distance of seven centuries? . 
5 At that time they had hardly outlined the frontiers among the peoples. Nonation ~ 
~~ had conscience @nough of itself to feel better than its neighbor. Men spoke different 
languages, but they understood each other in the languagé which the dominion of 
Rome, perpetuated by the power of the church, had made universal. Many were the 
minds of the peoples, but the culture they received was identically the same. As 
_ the future nations blended in Christianity, the future national geniuses promenaded 
fraternally in the alleys of the trivium or the quadrivium under the severe maternal 
eye of theology. ae ‘ ; 
To-day the sciences (and how many sciences) are emancipated; the quadrivium has 
oH Decome the millivium; thousands of intellects here teem in full liberty. Science is 
_ again at Paris, but it is everywhere. Everywhere in Europe, in countries unknown, 
practically, to the thirteenth century; in the New World the universities now work 
and think, Each speaks the language of a country. Seven centuries ago I would 
have addressed you this discourse.in Latin and you would have understood me. 
You would have exchanged your gay talk among yourselyes in the Latin tongue. 
_ To-day, this night, and around this table, you speak all the languages. Ispeak mine, 
_ for fear, that Pantagruel, who should be prowling about these environs, may sud- 
denly appear and treat me like the ‘“Limosin” who ‘‘despumated the Latin ver- 
bosities.” Thus, gentlemen, all is separated, diversified, and multiplied. Life is 
“everywhere extended and everywhere active. An hour of our times accomplishes 
more work than a century of the times past, Be happy, then, that you live to-day, 
for to-day is. great.. Let me add, do not depend upon the work of your fathers; no 
generation has the right to be inert; each to its task, and yours is important. To 
you to-morrow should be better than to-day. g ‘ 
For there are great shadows over our great lights, All of our activity is not well 
_ employed; too large a part is given to hate and destruction. Gentlemen foreign 
- students, I wish to talk to you as men. I have heard many generous illusions ex- 
pressed these days. Day before yesterday, in-a beautiful familiar ceremony, dele- 
gates from all nations celebrated peace and fraternity. Yesterday, at the time when 
the endeayor was made to select by lot the orator who should speak solely in the 
name of the foreigners, you were asked if there were nations still. ‘There are no 
longer ay nations,” some one replied, ‘there are only universities.” 
And since you had taken the resolution to “thee” and “thou,” it was a pleasure 
to hear cried from one end of the table to the other, ‘““To thee, Cambridge! To thee, 
_ Bologne! To thee, Harvard! To thee, Vienna! To»thee, Liege! To thee, Buda- 
_Pesth! To thee, Venezuela! To thee, Lund! To thee, Bale! To thee, Helsingfors! 
To thee, Prague!” But in listening to you I was apprehensive of the crash against 
- the hard reality which your dream would receive. I could not rid myself of the sad 
thought that many of you perhaps will meet elsewhere than at feasts. 
Young men, do not look too much on the bright side of the world, so that you 
may not lose your courage on the day when you will see it as it really is. Cosmo- 
politism is not the true remedy for the disease we suffer. Again, I do not preach to 
you the doctrine ‘‘I do not believe it; I do not like it; it is not of our period!” 
In days long past there was a Christian cosmopolitism, but in those times, ideas 
   
-P-A-G-E-213
    
       _ CONGRESS OF SECONDARY AND SUPERIOR EDUCATION, 185 
and beliefs universally admitted, constituted the common ground of the intelli- 
~ gence and heart of men. To-day that is’ questioned and violently contested. 
At the close of the last century philosophic cosmopolitism succeeded Christian 
cosmopolitism. All those who thought found themselves cramped within the con-— 
fines. It seemed that the cighteenth century prepared the éra of nations fully con-— 
scious of themselves, attached to their past, of which all the relics were venerated, 
proud of their antiquity or boastful of their infancy, resolved to exist, and claim- 
ing for their use all virtues and all energies. 
Gentlemen, our century has made nations. It has created or resuscitated Greece, 
Belgium, Italy, Hungary, Germany, Roumania, Servia, Bulgaria, and the American os 
Republics. Behold its principal office, its distinctive mark, its originality, and its 
glory! Cosmopolitism as it was understood in other times, should it seek to again 
assert itself, would be instantly overthrown by a breath from all the breasts of peo- 
ples. ‘ 
Gentlemen foreign students, love then your country as we love ours. In the great 
uncertainty when, on all vital questions, we leave science and philosophy, human 
activity, if it have not an immediate, visible, and tangible object, will risk decay. 
I well know that if I kept to myself certain sentiments and certain ideas the love 
of native soil, the long line of ancestors, the joy of finding my soul in their thoughts 
and actions, in their history, and in their legend; if I did not feel myself part of 
the whole, the origin of which is lost in the fog, and the future is indefinite; if I 
did not thrill at the singing of a national hymn, if I did not entertain for the flag 
the adoration of a pagan for an idol, who offers incense and at certain days heca- 
tombs; if I should become forgetful of national sorrows, truly I should no longer 
know what I am, nor.that which I do in this world. I should lose the principal 
motive for living. J 
What'is then the great problem of the time in which you live? It is tle reconcili-* 
ation of the immediate and clear rights of countries with the more vague but superior 
rights of humanity. 
To effect this reconciliation do not count too much on science. Mathematics, 
physics, and chemistry are the aides-de-camp of the ministers of war. Do not expeét 
this even of philosophy, It teaches that the feeble have no right to live. The doc- 
trine of which you are the apostles may be explained in two words: Every country 
owes respect to all countries. In all places where men consent to live together 
under the same laws, with likesentiments and like passions, this collective existence 
is legitimate; it is august; it is sacred; it is inviolable. Young men, to-morrow — 
you will write the opinion of the ‘world. To the world which hesitates between the 
old idea and the new, where the phenomena of barbaric antiquity are confounded in 
a strange experience with the marvelous progress of civilization, give this dogma: 
The greatest of crimes against humanity is to kill or mutilate a nation. Be horrified 
at this crime. | Suffer the pains of the victims! 
Nevertheless, do not misapprehend the meaning of my words. I know the duties 
of hosts toward their guests. I do not seek to interest you in our quarrel, nor to — 
solicit your aid. We desire to be equal to our task, and, please God, we will be 
equal to it. The expression of an egotistical sentiment before these young represent, 
atives of all peoples would be an error and an incivility. 
Let me say, however, that France of the nineteenth century has special reasons — 
for preaching the doctrine of respect of nations toward nations. Republicans of 
North America, our fathers fought side by side in the war for independence. They 
proclaimed together the right of the new period. Hellenists, we were at Navarin, 
with England and Russia, and our flag saluted the liberty of Athens. Belgians, 
we left our blood in the trenches of Anvers, . Italians, in the lapse of centuries past, 
your country has been the theatre of our wars of ambition. We placed the noblest 
passions of our soul in the war that we fought together. Ican say, then, to all,

HISTORICAL ANTECEDENTS OF THE PRESENT SYSTEM, 
The existing system of education in Scotland is an outcome of catises 
deeply involved in the political and religious history of the country. 
The principles which give life and character to the system brought 
about the Reformation, and to the issue of that struggle is due the 
final establishment of those principles. 
While the Reformation changed the conditions under: which the 
means of education had been previously supplied, it did not destroy 
all the established schools, as was done, for instance, by the French 
Revolution, and consequently, looking at particular institutions, it 
may be said that education in Scotland has a history of continuous 
development extending over nearly seven centuries. The present sys- 
tem may therefore be best understood in the light of its historical ante- 
eedents, This history is the more significant to us because charac- 
terized by the successive adoption and gradual welding together of 
‘the principles which are now recognized in all English-speaking coun- 
tries as essential to an efficient system of popular education. It de- 
tives importance also from the fact that it offers a complete view of 
the process of substituting a civil for an ecclesiastical system, a proc- 
ess which seems destined to become universal. These considerations 
give. interest to the historical survey appended to the outline of the 
existing system. It must suffice here to say that this system was pre- 
ceeded by a complicated variety of educational agencies, of which the 
chief were parish schools, founded upon a statute of 1646, which was 
revived and made operative in 1696. Parish and burgh schools, sup- 
ported by local funds and by tuition fees, made up the public provision 
for education. In addition there wee schools partly maintained by 
_ parliamentary grants, mission and sessional schools maintained ‘by 
the Established Church and the Free Church, and other parochial and 
private schools, Parish and burgh schools carried instruction to the 
level of the universities, which were easily accessible to all classes. 
The date of the passage of the “Scotch Education Act” (1872) was 
 
-P-A-G-E-217
  EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM OF SCOTLAND. ce ESO 
opportune for the organization of these various agencies into a sys- 
tem maintained by the combined action of the Government and local 
authorities. 
In framing the Scotch act care was taken, as in framing the En- 
glish act two years before, to guard the sete of the Government 
with respect to funds appropriated from the public treasury. At the 
same time equal care was shown for the preservation of the Scotch 
ideal. This was a broad and comprehensive ideal, embracing the dif- 
ferent grades of scholastic work; it was scientific, recognizing the 
professional character of the teaching vocation; and, on the social side, 
it was a liberal conception, purposing for all classes the chances, at 
least, of complete education; moreover, in the two and a quarter cen- 
turies during which the conception had been taking shape, abundant 
precedent had been established to guide in the final effort for its reali- 
zation. ; 
This ideal differentiates the Scotch act from the English act passed 
two years before. The latter related to elementary schools exclu, 
sively; the former has a wider scope, providing the foundations of a 
system of graded schools correlated to the universities which lie beyond 
its province. With respect to the interests of the Government, the two 
acts are substantially the same. : 
STRUCTURE AND OPERATIONS OF THE SYSTEM. 
The structure of the Scotch system of education was determined in all 
essential particulars by the original law (i.¢., Education Act, Scotland, 
1872). Subsequent laws have modified the system, chiefly in the way of 
extending its scope. The general operations of the system are directed, 
as are those of the English system, by the codes (i. e., body of rules sigh 
regulations for the application of the laws), issued annually by the 
- education department (committee of council on education, Scotland). 
These rules have reference to the conditions upon which the Govern- 
ment grant may be claimed by school authorities; beyond these large 
liberty is left to local authorities. 
1. CENTRAL ADMINISTRATION. 
For the general direction of the system a Scotch educational depart- 
ment was created, composed, like the English department, of lords of — 
the privy council, and having the same president. Each department 
has its own vice-president, who represents its interests in the House of 
Commons, and since 1885 each has had its own secretary.! The duties 
of the department are the same as those of the English department, 7. ¢., 
determining the conditions according to which parliamentary grants 
shall be distributed to the schools, maintaining a system of inspection 
over the schools, and administering the grant. 
‘Mr, Hensy Craik has filled this position in Seo bland since the division,

       _ The department submits to the House of Commons annually an es- 
_ timate of the amount of grant which will be required for the ensuing 
rear, accompanied by a report of the operations of the system: for the 
eurrent year. x 
“The basis adopted for the distribution of the Government grant is 
the same in Seotland as in England, i. e., the results of inspection as 
- to general conditiéns of efficiency and of examination in prescribed 
studies. According to present arrangements, the country is divided 
into three districts, assigned each to a chief inspector.» Under these 
are 27 subordinate inspectors and assistants who examine and report 
_ upon individual schools. 
2. ORIGIN AND PROVINCE oF LocAL ScHooL Boarps. 
- The Scotch act, 1872, provided for a uniform system of schools to be 
controlled by elected boards. For the purposes of this act, every par- 
ish and every burgh was constituted a school district, and ‘the election. 
_ of boards was made mandatory for each and all, mphereas, i in England, | 
‘the election of boards was left to the option of ratepayers, or. to the 
express order of the education, department. Ecclesiastical superin- 
tendence of public schools in Scotland, which, under the parish system 
(1696), had been simply transferred rank Catholic bishops to Presby- 
_ teriesy was abolished by the act of 1872 and all relations between the 
schools and the church terminated. The matter of religious instruction 
was left to the boards, excepting that if given at all it must be at the ~ 
opening or close of a school session, with provision for the free with- 
‘drawal of all children whose parents so desired, a privilege which had 
been accorded under the old ecclesiastical rule. Unlike the English act, 
the Scotch act did not prehibit the teaching of a religious catechism, or 
religious formulary distinctive of a particular denomination in the hours 
assigned to religious exercises. 
Power was given to the boards to claim and levy local taxes (rates) 
for the support of schools and to borrow money upon the rates to de- 
- fray costs of building and furnishing schoolhouses. ‘The act called 
for the maintenance of a school fand in every parish or burgh under 
the charge of a treasurer, appointed by the board, this fund to consist 
of the parliamentary grant, moneys raised by local taxation, from fines 
for violation of compulsory clause, private bequests, and school fees. 
a Present number of the boards.—979 boards, viz, 921 parish and 58 burgh, werein opera- 
tion in 1889-90, representing a population of 3,735,573, or 92 per cent of the esti- 
- mated total population. The population under individual boards ranges from 148, 
_ thesmatlest, to 511,415 (Glasgow). *The majority of the boards are of the minimum 
_ size allowed under the act, viz, 5 members. Several have the maximum of 15 mem-

absolute necessity. These clauses are significant of the different atti- 
tude of the Scotch and the English minds with respect to denomina- 
tional schools. In the former country the general preference was for 
a uniform system comprising the entire school provision; in the latter 
denominational schools were and still continue to be guarded with — 
intense and jealous solicitude. The different spirit of the two people — 
in this respect. is Hlustrated by the fact that, whereas the attendance 
upon private elementary schools (chiefly denominational) in England — 
~ fell from 92 per cent of the total attendance in 1874 to 844 per cent in 
1890, the corresponding decline in Scotland was from 53 to Abs 48, per. 
cent. é 
School supply, 1890, and growth since 1872.—In pursuance of the authority granted — 
them to provide adequate school accommodation, the boards have virtually met theex- — 
isting demand, In 1890 there was provision in State-aided schools for 723,840 children, 
or 17.61 per cent of the population, as against 281,688, or 8.3 per cent in 1872. Of tho — 
increase of 442,152 school places here indicated, 27 per cent, it is estimated, have 
_ been required by the growth of population in the eighteen years since the passago 
of the act. Making a small allowance for excess of places in a few districts, there 
remain about 70 per cent of seats as the deficiency in inspected schools at the time 
of the passage of the act. This accommodation has been provided at an expenditure 
of £5,207,712 ($26,038,560), of which 88 per cent is the contribution of school boards — 
raised upon the security of local taxes. The balance, comparatively small, has been 
derived from public grants, The school provision seems to bewell distributed. Tho 
- actual supply is about 38,000 places above the estimated demand, but this is no more 
than sufficient for special requirements in the way of class rooms, drawing-rooms, etc. — 
Classification of inspected schools—Tho number of elementary schools (i ¢., institu- 
tions under separate management). actually inspected in Scotland in 1889-90 was 
3,116, including 3,426 departmeats in which separate head teachers were employed. 
Of these only 313 were for infants, this grade of departments having much less de- 
velopment in Scotland thanin England; 53-were for boys only, 49 for girls, and 3,QU, 
following the time-honored custom of Scotland, admitted both sexes. Three indus-_ 
trial schools-had also beenestablished, all by the Glasgow board. In the same year 
54 higher class or secondary schools, 9 being private, were brought under govern-— 
ment inspection, as against 11 schools of this class recognized by the department at 
the date of the passage of the act.

    4, ScHoot ATTENDANCE. 
Compulsory law.—The act ordered every parent to secure the instrue- 
tion of his children between the ages of 5 and 13, or until a certificate 
of exemption should be secured. Parents failing in this obligation are 
subject to prosecution and penalty by fine or imprisonment. The com- 
pulsory provision extends to blind ehildren. Parochial or burghal 
authorities were authorized to pay the tuition fees of those children 
~ whose parents could not meet the expenditure, a provision rendered 
unnecessary by the recent remission of all fees. The Scotch act, by a 
_. Sweeping clause, made compulsory attendance universal; the English 
_act left the matter of compulsion to local managers. .A subsequent act 
(1878) fixed the standard of exemption in Scotland at the fifth, which 
pupils should pass at 11 years of age.’ In 1883, the upper limit of com- 
pulsory attendance in Scotland was raised to 14 years. 
The statistics of enrollment or number of registered pupils and of 
average attendance may be regarded as the index both of popular sen- 
_ timent with reference to the schools and of the successful administra- 
tion of the compulsory clause. . These considerations give interest to 
the following data: 
Enroliment.—The total number of schools borne on the grant list in 1889-90 have 
an enrollment (i. ¢., number on registers) of 673,566, or 82 per cent of the estimated 
number who might avail themselves of the school provision. These figures are 
higher than the corresponding figures for the previous year, showing a continuance 
__ of the increase in school attendance, that has been going on from year to year, since 
“the passage of the act. Of the specified total 2.42 per cent were below 5, i. ¢., the 
_ lower age limit of compulsion, and 2.20 per cent above 14, the upper limit. 
The number of sehools actually inspected, which was a little below the number 
on the list, showed a total registration of 664,466, of whom 586,623 (viz, 303,964 boys, 
282,659 girls) were present at inspection. From this item it appears that the boys 
outnumber the girls. 
Average attendance.—In comparing the average attendance upon the 
schools of Scotland with that of other countries, and especially with 
_ our own country, it is important to keep in mind, not only the uniform 
compulsory law, but the requirements as to attendances in the case of 
schools claiming a share in the grant. Every such school, as in Eng- 
land, must have met for at least four hundred sessions during the year, 
moreover by far the larger part of the grant is now reckoned on the 
basis of average attendance.’ The mode of arriving at this item is as 
follows: | 
The average number in attendance for any period is found by adding together 
the attendances of all the pupils for that same period, and dividing the sum by the 
number of times the school has met within the same period. 
  
1 Standard in Scotland as in England corresponds very nearly to grade in the United 
States. The work of each,standard is intended to cover a year. To pass the fifth 
standard a pupil must be able to read with expression a short passage of prose or of 
poetry; to write a short dictation exercise, and to perform examples in simple pro- 
portion and the four elementary rules as applied to common fractions, 
 
-P-A-G-E-221
  EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM OF SCOTLAND. 193 
Attendance ata morning or afternoon meeting may not be reckoned for any pupil 
who has been under instruction in seeular subjects less than two hours if above or 
one hour and a half if under 7 years of age. 
Exceptions to the foregoing requirement are made in the case of half-timers, i.e, _ 
children who are permitted to engage in remunerative labor for a portion of the 
day, and for those who live at a great distance from any efficient school; these hay- 
ing the advantage of the following provisions: 
Two consecutive hours are reckoned as an attendance and a half in the case of— 
1. Pupils who have passed the third standard, and are: (a) Employed under any 
haif-time act. -(b) Over 10 years of age, and certified by the managers to be bene- 
ficially and necessarily employed at work when not at a school. 
2. Pupils residing 2 miles or upwards from a suitable State aided school. At- 
tendances may not be reckoned for any scholar in a day school under 3 or above 18 
years of age.! 
Pupils coming under these special provisions must have attended, however, not 
less than 150 times in the course of the school year, while the sum of their addi- 
tional attendances and the required attendances must not exceed three-fourths of 
the number of school sessions during the year. 
While the above provisions tend to foster regularity in school at- > 
tendance, it should be remembered that a large proportion of the par- 
ishes of Scotland, by reason of their. natural configuration, present 
great obstacles to school attendance. This is particularly true of the 
insular parishes and those of the northern Highlands. Special grants 
have, however, done much to overcome. these difficulties im the last 
five years. Making all due allowances for these conditions, the at- 
tendance has not yet reached an average satisfactory to the depart- 
ment or to the boards. 
  
Statistics of attendance.—The statistics show that in 1889-90 an average attendance 
was reached of 519,738, or 88 per cent of the enrollment. This average attendance was 
equal to 12.65 per cent of the population, as against an average attendance equivalent 
to 6.29 per cenit of the population of 1872-73. ‘The average attendance upon night 
schools was 10,766, or four times the attendance in 1872. The maximum attendance 
upon these schools, however, was reached in 1880. The falling off since that date is 
compensated by the greater advancement of the pupils upon entering. 
  Trregularity of attendance and early withdrawal under the exemp- 
tion provisions are evils with which both the local authorities and the 
department are continually striving. Early in 1891 the school boards 
held a general conference in Edinburgh on the subject, and various 
means of promoting attendance were considered. 
The Glasgow board employs a system of bursaries to induce poor 
children to prolong their studies through the sixth standard or higher, 
It was agreed at the conference that twelve years, ?. ¢., the age assigned 
for the completion of the exemption standard, is altogether too early 
an age for ceasing school attendance. 
Effects of remission of fees—There has not yet been sufficient time to 
determine the effect of the remission of fees (accomplished in part in 
1889, and virtually completed in 1891) upon school attendance. Ap- 
parently, however, it will increase the attendance of pupils in the com-

  pulsory ages, and cause a falling off in the attendance of those below 5 
and above 14 years of age. ‘This is especially regretted in the case of 
the youngest pupils, ¢. ¢., those below 5, whose attendance increased 
under the impulse of the first provision for free instruction. Com- 
menting upon these indications the London Times says: 
In 1889, just before free education was introduced, out of every 10,000 children 
attending Scotch elementary schools, only 193 (against 976 in England) were below 
5 years of age. .In 1890 that number had increased to 242, and there was every indi- 
cation of still further improvement in the same direction. At the very time, how- 
ever, when English children between 3 and 5 were being freed from the charge of 
fees, school managers in Scotland are sorely tempted to recommence exacting. fees 
for children of those ages, so undoing the good work they have just been beginning.— 
[London Times, October 8, 1891, 
5, FINANCES. 
The income of public elementary schools is derived from the parlia- 
mentary grant, rates (local taxes), subscriptions, and since October, 
1889, an allowance made for the remission of fees, which up to that 
time furnished about one-third of the revenue. Private schools under 
inspection draw nothing from the rates, 
Income.—The entire income of elementary schools, day and night included, amounted 
in 1889~90..to-£1,137,344 (35,689,220). The cost of maintenance was a trifle less, 
£1,127,057 ($5,635,285). | 
Expenditure.—The expenditure for day schools was derived as follows: 
  
Per 
cent. 
    
   Parliamentary grant. £486,408 | 43.67 244,516 | 21.96 355,381] 31.91 127,384 | 2.46 
  Voluntary subscriptions 
1, 113, 639 
  
The cost of maintenance per capita of average attendance was £2 48. 4d. ($11.05) 
in public schools, and £1 9s. 82d. ($7.43) in voluntary schools. These rates have 
been gradually rising during the last decade, but were slightly lower in 1890 than 
in the previous year. Public schools show the least increase, viz: 1s. 8}d. (42} cents) 
in the decade, and Free Church schools the greatest, viz: 6s. 34d. ($1.57). 
The amount credited to the local taxes (rates) in the above tabulation is exclusive 
of any outgoes for buildings, interest on loans, ete. The entire expenditure from 
this source was estimated at £559,273 ($2,796,365) or £1 6s. 4d. ($6.50) per capita of 
average attendance in public schools. Exact financial comparisons with the first 
year of the operations of the act can not be made with the dataat hand; itis appear- 
ent, however, that the parliamentary grant was about three and one-half times as 
great in 1889-90 as in 1872~73. 
6. SUBJECTS AND STANDARDS OF INSTRUCTION. 
In the act of 1872 a very decided stand was taken in favor of that 
conception of education which had been consecrated by the parish- 
school statute of 1846, in which education. was treated as an integral 
process, extending from primary schools to the university.
-P-A-G-E-223
  Z 5 : 
EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM OF SCOTLAND. 195.5 
It was expressly enjoined in the act that care should be taken to 
preserve the standard of education existing in the public schools of 
Scotiand at the time of its passage. 
As to burgh schools, it was ordered that they should be managed 
with reference to giving instruction in the higher branches, and that 
to this end the school boards of the respective burghs should provide a 
sufficient number of elementary schools elsewhere in the burgh. The 
higher-class schools, it should be observed, while sharing in the rates, 
did not participate in the parliamentary grants; on the other hand, 
their funds were not to go into the common-school fund, but were to be 
managed exclusively in their own interests. As a further evidence of 
the determination to preserve their prestige, teachers seeking positions 
in these higher schools were to be examined before a special body 
consisting of university professors or teachers of distinction appointed 
by the school board. 
The distribution of the grant to elementary schools upon the results 
of examination has become in Scotland as in England the determining 
factor in respect to studies. The subjects, for which payment is al- 
lowed, are classified as obligatory (7.¢. reading, writing, arithmetic) 
and optional, The latter afford a wide range of choice among subjects 
which are tested’ by (1) collective examination, and hence called class 
subjects, and (2) those which may be taken by individuals, and which 
are known as specific. 
Under the rules of the Scottish Department the obligator y branches 
are arranged in six grades or standards, each designed for a year’s 
work. The English programme includes a seventh standard, which is 
covered in Scotland by an ex-sixth and the higher-class schools. Latin, 
Greek, and other higher subjects may be taught in elementary schools 
before the hour appointed for beginning the morning session, 7@. ¢., ten 
o'clock; at the noon intermission, ¢. e., between one and two, and after 
four in the afternoon, as was formerly the custom in many parish 
schools, if these subjects are not included in the regular progenies of 
the school. 
THE WORK OF THE SCHOOLS AS SHOWN BY THE oe ee 25 OF THE 
GOVERNMENT EXAMINATION. 
Obligatory branches.—The system of individual examination main- 
tained in all grades, until 1886, had this advantage, that it resulted in 
an annual classification of pupils according to their attainments in 
the obligatory subjects, and thus furnished a means of estimating the effi- 
ciency of the schools. In 1886 the experiment was made of testing 
pupils below the third grade (standard) by collective examination, and . 
in 1890 this change was extended to all grades so far as regards the 
obligatory subjects. The classified results of examination were still 
given in 1889-’90 for pupils above the third standard. 
     
      
-P-A-G-E-224
  196° EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
Of 664,466 pupils on the registers of inspected schools in this year, 516,046 were 
qualified by age and number of attendances, to be presented for examination; 238,- 
820 were examined collectively in standards below the third, and 233,181 individually 
in standards above. 
The following table shows the classification of the latter by age and by grade, 
and also brings into significant comparison with these data the number of pupils 
above 10 years of age examined in each standard, i. ¢., grade:

In commenting upon this exposition of the work of the schools, the committee say: 
“We must again draw attention to another point in which the statistics afford mat- 
ter of regret, viz, the insufficient presentation of children in the higher standards. 
Of 270,760 children on the register of schools whose age qualified them for examina- 
tion in three upper standards only 170,070, or 62.81 per cent, were presented in or above 
those standards. The table shows that of the scholars actually examined in stand- 
ard third, who should all have been under 10, only 55.31 per cent were under that 
age and 44.69 per’cent were oyer it. A similar backwardness must, we fear, extend 
to the higher standards.” 
Optional branches.—Of 3,075 departments (exclusive of infants’ departments) exam- 
ined during the year, optional class subjects had been taken in 3,036. Besides Eng- 
lish, which was taken in 3,035 cases, 2,946 departments took history and geography; 
545 needlework, and 143 elementary science. The grant for optional subjects was 
awarded upon an average attendance of 410,169 pupils above 7 years of age, distrib- 
uted in 2,997 departments; the average payment allowed for these subjects was 4s. 
2d. per capita. 
Of 51,000 scholars presented in specific subjects for individual examination, 6,231 
were examined, and 4,793 passed in three such subjects; 17,410 were examined, and 
18,922 passed in two such subjects, and 25,129 passed in one subject. The subjects 
generally taken were physical geography, domestic economy, French, animal phys- 
jology, Latin, and mathematics. In addition to the subjects specitied above the re- 
port states that military drill is systematically taught in 352 schools; cooking formed 
part of the course in 303 schocls, payment being made for the same in behalf of 
12,168 girls at 4s. and for 784 at 28. 
‘Teachers in many instances seck to promote habits of economy by establishing 
school banks; 80 of these institutions were reported in 1889-90 and also 238 school 
libraries. : 
To sum up the results of the examination it appears that in 1889-90 for every 100 
pupils in day schools who had made the requisite number of attendances, 14 were 
_ below and 87 above 7 years of age; 55 were examined in standards below the third 
and 45 in standards third to sixth; 80 earned grants for additional class subjects 
and 10 for specific subjects.   
Effects of payment upon r&ults—As the parliamentary grant repre- 
sents about half the income of the schools, the mode of its distribution
-P-A-G-E-225
  EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM OF SCOTLAND. 197 
must naturally have a powerful influence upon the work of the schools. 
So long as the greater part of the grant was allotted upon the results 
of individual examination in elementary studies it tended to depress — 
scholastic ideals. 
This effect is discussed very fully by Dr. S. 8S. Laurie in his recent 
report on the Dick bequest. He shows conclusively by comparative 
statistics that there has been a downward movement in the higher sub- 
jects excepting in those parishes where the influence of the system in 
this respect has been counteracted by special funds for stimulating in- 
struction in these subjects.+ 
This conviction of the effects of the system in Scotland, where the 
higher subjects are specially prized, contributed even more than the 
opposition developed in England to bring about changes in the modes of 
examination and classification. Under present arrangements two-thirds 
of the grant? (omitting grants for optional subjects and special grants) 
is a specified rate (i. ¢., 10s. to 14s) per capita of average attendance, an 
adjustment which has freed the scholastic work from many paralyzing 
restrictions. : 
7. TEACHERS. 
Examination, appointment, salaries, and tenure.—The law of 1872 re- 
quired that the principal teacher of every public school should be the 
holder of a Government certificate awarded upon examination. In ree- 
ognition, however, of the fact that a proportion of Scotch teachers were 
likely to be university graduates, it was provided that a degree in arts 
or science should be accepted in lieu of the examination, but in this 
case candidates must satisfy the examiners of their skill in the theory 
and practice of teaching. The Government certificates are of four 
grades or classes. Candidates for the certificate examinations must be 
either students of the training colleges or must have have had actual 
experience in teaching. No certificate above the second ‘class is origi- 
nally issued, nor can the higher class certificates be secured without, 
successful service in the schools. 
The appointment of teachers, rates of compensation, and tenure of 
office were left to the boards. These extensive and arbitrary powers 
were somewhat restricted by an act of 1882, which was intended to 
give teachers protection against sudden and unwarrantable dismissal, 
an eyil which, especially in small districts, had grown to alarming pro- 
portions.

2The distribution of the grant in Scotland is very nearly the same as in England, 
for which see footnote, p. 245 of the Commissioner’s report. The only material dif- 
ference is a minimum fixed grant of 10s. in Scotland as against 12}s. in England, and 
a continuance in Scotland of grants on the report of collective examinations in the 
obligatory subjects. These are at the rate of 1s., 2s., or 3s. per capita of average at- 
tendance below the third standard and 1}s., 24s., or 3}s. above.
-P-A-G-E-226
        — 198 EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
No general pension scheme has yet been devised, but the Department 
awards a limited number of retiring allowances, and individual boards 
may make similar provision for aged or disabled teachers. This is a 
matter which excites great attention. The Educational Institute (an 
association equivalent to the National Educational Association of our 
own country) maintains a committee to devise a superannuation scheme 
and work for its adoption. 
‘Training of teachers.—The act contained no specifie provision as to 
the training of teachers, but the requirement that the principal of a 
public school shall be certificated naturally promotes attendance upon 
the training colleges. These share in the Government grant, payments 
being made in behalf of all students admitted as Queen’s scholars. 
The status of the teaching force in 1889-90 is indicated by the fol- 
lowing statistics: 
Number and classification of teachers.—The teaching foree employed in the inspected 
day schools numbered 12,948. These were classified as follows: 
  
  
    
        
  Num. | Per cent et | Per cent | Per cent ber. | of total. | Male. Female.’ cr malo. of female. ns IE i

| 4,841 | 62 
1 
  8,107 | 
  
The number of certificated teachers, which is about two and one-fourth times the 
number of separate departments, has increased by 5,179 since 1872, or a little more 
than 200 per cent, and is equivalent to 1 for every 66 children in average attendance 
upon the schools inspected. 
Salaries and pensions.—The average salary of schoolmasters has risen from £101 16s 
Td. ($509) to £133 9s. ($667.25). That of schoolmistresses from £55 14s. 2d. ($278.50) 
to £62 4s, 11d. ($311.25). Besides this 1,713 masters and 483 mistresses are provided 
with residences free of rent. 
During the year the department awarded 3 pensions of £25 and 10 of £20. 
Since the practice of granting pensions was resumed in 1875, 375 Scotch applications 
have been dealt with and 12 pensions of £30, 52 of £25, and 106 cf £20, and 29 
gratuities to the amount of £910 have been awarded. 
Qualifications of teachers.—Of 3,738 male teachers 77.07 per cent had been students 
in a training college, while of 3,880 female teachers 63.12 per cent had received a 
similar training. The committee of council observe in their report “That of the mi- 
nority, especially in the case of the male teachers, many have obtained, otherwise 
than in the training colleges, a training of a very valuable sort. Many teachers, of 
both sexes, who enter the examination as acting teachers, have acquired a knowl- 
edge of the duties of their profession by serving as pupil teachers, and afterwards 
as assistants under teachers of large experience and skill. Of the male teachers, 
again, we find that 504 are graduates, while many have been partially educated at 
the universities, and have also acquired experience by service in schools.” 
8. THE TRAINING COLLEGES. 
The training colleges of Scotland, like those of England, were estab- 
lished by denominational effort before the passage of the education 
act. They retain their former relations, being subject to government 
inspection in respect only to the conditions upon which they may claim
-P-A-G-E-227
  EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM OF SCOTLAND. 199 
a share in the public grant. Practice schools are attached to the col- 
leges, and in some eases there is a hall in which the students are 
boarded and lodged. ‘ 
The conditions of admission are determined by the anthoriiien of 
each college, the education department simply requiring that candi- 
dates for “Queen’s scholarships” should signify their intention of 
adopting and following the teaching profession in public schools, The 
course of training is two years, with an annual examination by the 
government inspector at each college. Certificates are awarded stu- 
dents who pass these examinations and fulfill successfully a probation- 
ary term of teaching. 
The curriculum of the training colleges is determined mainly by the 
government examination. It includes for men, the elementary branches 
considered in relation to teaching, also cea management, algebra, - 
and mensuration, geometry, political economy, vocal music, drawing, 
and one or two of the following languages: Latin, Greek, French, Ger- 
man. The syllabus for women omits geometry, mensuration, and po- 
litical economy, allows only one language (¢. e., Latin, French, or Ger- 
man), and adds domestic economy and needlework. Special arzrange- 
“ments also made by which students may pursue branches of science 
with a view to passing the certificate examinations of the science and 
art department. Since 1873 special privileges have been accordéd” 
teachers who combine attendance upon university elasses with the 
training college course, an arrangement greatly facilitated by the fact 
that all the training colleges are in university towns, 4. ¢., three in 
Edinburgh, two in Glasgow, and two in Aberdeen. This relation has 
been strengthened by the enthusiastic service of Prof. J. M. D. Meikle- 
john, wko holds the professorship of the theory, histery, and practice 
of education in the University of St. Andrews, and Dr. 8. 8. Laurie, 
professor of the institutes and history of education in the University 
of Kdinburgh. A new impulse has recently been given to this part of 
the work of teachers’ training by the action of the endowed schools 
commission. This body set aside the sum of £250 ($1,250) to be given 
annually as bursaries of not less than £25 each to training-college 
students in Glasgow, who have already taken two sessions at the uni- 
versity, and who bind themselves to compete for a degree in arts, or 
science, 
    
Statistics of the training colleges.—The training colleges are seven in number, six 
being coeducation schools, and one for women only. They were attended in 1880 by 
852 students, é. ¢., 294. men, and 558 women. With such an attendange they can fur- 
nish each year rather more than 400 teachers, a number nearly sufficient to make up 
the estimated annual loss (calculated at 6 per cent) in the teaching force. Of the 
students in attendance 152 availed themselves of the arrangements for combining 
attendance upon university classes. 
The examinations of 1890 were successfully passed by 730 candidates, of whom 417 
(138 men and 279 women) were students of the colleges and 313 (75 men, 238 women) 
acting teachers admitted to examination. 
The stati of the training colleges, practice schools included, numbered 73 persons, 
and the expenditure for their maintenance amounted to £37,083 10s. ($185,417.50).

9. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT OF SCHOOLS. 
The Scottish system of education, as we have seen, makes a nearer 
approach to uniformity than the English. It is, however, far removed 
from a centralized system such as that of France or even from a system 
deeply penetrated and permeated by the will of a central power like 
that of Germany. Indeed, in the Seotch system local authority is ex- 
cessive, and is so often exercised in a capricious and narrow spirit that 
the teaching fraternity are forced to combine against it. Discontent 
with hampering conditions manifests itself in ways with which we are 
- familiar in this country; they may be summed up as a general opposi- 
tion to small areas of administration, and to boards which represent 
only the unprofessional and niggardly spirit of small districts. Local 
independence, at first sight, seems to be much more limited with re- 
spect to the organization and conduct of schools than to the control 
ofthe teaching service. In reality, however, the conditions of uniformity 
in schools, imposed by the department, are few and specify only mini. 
mum requirements for participation in the grant. They relate to the 
capacity of schoolrooms (80 cubic feet and 8 square feet of area for each 
child in average attendance being the specified dimensions’, lighting, ven- 
tilation, etc., the number of sessions, and the composition of the teach- 
“ing staff. ~The principal teacher must be certificated, and an assistant 
pupil teacher must be provided for eyery 30 pupils in average attend- 
ance above the first 60, or an assistant adult teacher for every addi- 
tional 50 pupils, or an additional certificated teacher for every additional 
70 pupils. 
Outside of these provisions, and even within the range of interpreta- 
tion which may be put upon them, there are all the differences of actual 
status which arise from diverse degrees of public or liberal spirit in 
communities, from the opposite effects of sparse and dense populations, 
and from dissimilar social and industrial demands, A comparatively 
extensive rural parish with a school census of thirty children can not be 
leveled up to an urban district with a school population running into 
the thousands, easily accessible to centrally located buildings. These 
differences may be illustrated by the reports of typical districts. 
Mr. Waddell, inspector of a district in the western division of Scot- 
land, says: §   
  A number of small schools in various parts of the district—such as Tullibardine, 
Gleneagles, Glendevon, Kinbuck, Cleish, Arus, and Chapel Green—remain to be con- 
sidered. Each of these would be very much improved by material alterations, in 
some cases structural, in others internal, but not precisely on the ground of defective 
accommodation. In outlying districts, nowadays, the question rarely is of that 
nature, rural parishes tending rather to lose than to acquire population. The diffi- 
culty in their case rather is to secure, with perhaps a falling valuation roll, a rise in 
the conception of what is due to comfort, neatness, and the educational views of the 
time. How far it is proper to interfere in such cases will always be matter of opinion, 
and the discussion of the question with managers requires delicate handling. If a 
reference be made to the official instructions (1886) the mark ‘ excellent” is intended
-P-A-G-E-229
  EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM OF SCOTLAND. 201 
to be reserved for cases of exceptional merit, and will depend upon the estimate 
formed in regard to the premises, discipline, ete. Some one of the managers is almost 
certain to urge that the building was approved at its erection as meeting all require- 
ments. True; and aship launched at the same date was classed A-1 for the time, 
though now docked for extensive repairs. 
No educational problem would benefit more by a sweeping extension of school- 
board areas than that of school supply. ‘The school places actually existing in the 
district are probably almost sufficient in total amount for the wants of the popula- 
tion; it is the distribution of them mainly which is imperfect. Nor can any com- 
prehensive and economical scheme of school supply be framed by a large number of 
small bodies, often with conflicting pecuniary interests. Such a conflict of interests 
is actually arresting improvement in one locality at the present moment. 
  Mr. Fraser, inspector of another district of the same division, says: 
In the Mull schools allotted to me only two pupils were presented in Gaelic. They 
read out of Matthew’s Gospel with ease, and translated with tolerable accuracy, but 
they knew very little of the grammar of the language. As far as my observation ex- 
tended, it did not seem to be considered necessary to give systematic bilingual instruc- 
tion to the children in most of the schools in this district. In one or two cases it 
certainly appeared as if the children did not exactly comprehend what I said to them 
when I addressed them in English, but these cases belonged entirely to the lower 
sections of the schools. I have reason to believe, however, that although no regu- 
lar course of bilingual instruction is given, the teacher (when he knows Gaelic) fre- 
quently interprets an English word by a familiar Gaelic term. I found that com- 
parative ignorance of English was, as a rule, combined with a kind of rustic diffi- 
dence which the asking of a question in Gaelic frequently dispelled. Oné of the 
pleasant surprises of my visit was to meet with such superior reading and general 
intelligence, in connection with the small side school of Gribun, on the western sea- 
board. It ismy deliberate impression that under proper conditions of school man- 
agement no children are more responsive to the stimulus of sound instruction than 
Highland children. Their isolation from the busy haunts of men increases their 
wonder and curiosity, and for natural shrewdness and sagacity and capability of 
taking on the marks of the higher civilization they will compare favorably with Low- 
land children. Given painstaking and wise teaching, and the best results will follow. 
  Mr. Muir, an inspector in the northern division, writes: 
Many Shetland children labor under great disadvantages. Mr. Robertson’s re- 
marks on the way in which population in the West Highlands is gathered into cen- 
ters do not apply to Shetland. Half a dozen houses constitute quite a considerable 
hamlet there. The work that is done in these islands is often highly praiseworthy. 
A stranger unused to schools who chanced to be visiting Shetland in company with 
the Government official, might be inclined to think that too high a standard of edu- 
cation was looked for, that it was unreasonable to give, in districts far from kirk or 
market, work to be done that might be reasonable enough in Dundee, Montrose, or 
Aberdeen. In some schools the children would answer rather miserably, and the 
stranger would be inclined to say, “Quite natural. Far too much has been expected.” 
The inspector might then take the stranger to some school 3 or 4 miles off, fre- 
quented by a similar class of children, whose local circumstances were as bad as 
those of the first school, if not worse. There he would find results distinctly better. 
Another teacher comes and the results are suddenly poor. An inspector comes to a 
school that has been doing badly, and, lo! the examiner next year would be inclined 
to think that thirty or forty clean, well-behaved, intelligent children had been im- 
ported-into the parish, I do not wish to point out individual schools, but there are 
cases which will occur to any Shetlander who reads this where in the midst of edu- 
cational fertility some one school has remained dry, like Gideon’s fleece. 
 
-P-A-G-E-230
    Boe EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-80. 
The reports of city boards, on the other hand, are fall of evidences 
of activity and progress. The triennial report of the Glasgow board 
(1888-1889) states that accommodation had been provided during 
the three years in new or enlarged buildings for 10,314 pupils, and 
enumerates among the increased facilities for educational work draw- 
ing rooms, laboratories, and lecture rooms. The report of the Edin- 
burgh board for the same period gives the following data with respect 
to a projected new building: 
In July, 1888, steps were taken to secure a site for a new school in the south-west 
of the city, and in February, 1889, Millerfield House and grounds, haying an area of 
nearly an acre and a quarter, were purchased for £5,620. Plans for a school on this 
site were prepared by the board’s architect, and approved by the Scotch education 
department. The estimated cost, inclusive of site, is £27,300. The school, to be 
known as ‘‘Sciennes School,” is expected to be ready for ocenpation before the close 
of this year. Accommodation is to be provided for 1,317 pupils, caleulated at the 
rate of 10 square feet per pupil in the juvenile department and 8 square feet in the 
infant department. In addition, four rooms will be specially fitted up for the teach- 
ing of drawing, cookery, and science, two of these with accommodation for 100 
pupils cach, and two for 81 each. Advantage has been taken of the sloping nature 
of the site for providing a large swimming bath and gymnasium in the basement 
floor. The heating and ventilation of the school will be done by what is known as 
the mechanical system. The ceremony of laying the foundation-stone was performed 
on the 24th May, 1890. This school, when completed, will certainly be one of the 
very best in Scotland.    
These reports bristle with discussions of familiar topics, physical 
training, drawing, practical cookery, training in music, the care of des- 
titute children, special teachers, etc. Some idea of the effort made by 
the Edinburgh board to provide efficient instruction in branches out- 
side of the required program may be formed from the fact that on a 
total force of 551 teachers employed in 23 schools, there were in 1891, 
“sewing mistresses, 24; singing masters, 7; sewing assistants, 20; 
cookery teachers, 3; gymnastic instructors, 4.” 
10. RECENT EXPANSION OF THE SYSTEM. 
General provisions.—The system whose structure is here outlined has 
been greatly expanded by legislation and by rulings of the Department 
during the last six years. ‘ 
In addition to the change from individual to collective examination 
in the lower standards, introduced in 1886, the code for that year also 
increased the scope of night schools, thereby enhancing their benefits 
for the artisan class. 
The most momeitous change in the system, however, was effected in 
1889, when Scotland decided to devote a sum yielding £250,000 ($1,250,- 
000) annually to the relief of school fees. This purpose went into effect 
October, 1889, at which time the compulsory standards from the first 
to the fifth, inclusive, were made free in 3,041 out of 3,126 schools, 
while in 774 the benefits of free education were extended further. 
The fund appropriated for this purpose became available by the local 
 
-P-A-G-E-231
  EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM OF SCOTLAND. eS 
government act of 1889, under which revenues derived from the pro- 
bate duty were granted. to school boards for the relief of fees. A min- 
ute of the Education Department regulating the application of the fund 
was issued August 26, of the same year.! 
The loeal taxation act of 1890 placed a large sum derived from 
eustoms and excise at the disposal of the county councils. Of this 
£40,000 ($200,000) was granted to the school boards for the purpose of 
extending the limits of free education. By a minute of June 11, 1891, 
‘exemption from fees was granted to all pupils hetween the compulsory 
age limits. This, it should be observed, was an extension as regards 
standards, but a limitation as regards age. 
In respect both to freedom of classification and the remission of fees, 
Scotland set the example to England. 
Provision for special classes of children.—In developing the system of 
education the wants of special classes have not been ignored. The 
original act, as we have seen, included blind children in the eompul- 
sory provision. In 1890 an act was passed dealing with the education 
of blind and deaf-mute children, and the sanction of the treasury was 
obtained for special grants to any institution providing for their train- 
ing. The special needs of the Highland parishes, arising from their 
sparse and scattered populations and peculiar topography, were the con- 
stant subject of solicitude under the parish system. Sincethe passage of 
the education act commissions of inquiry have been appointed from 
time to time to report upon these regions, and in 1884 specially liberal 
grants were offered to the schools in these districts on such terms as 
seemed likely to inerease the attendance. In 1889-90 the conditions 
for receiving this grant were fulfilled by 581 cut of 661 schools, with 
excellent results. The amount paid out under this head was £5,972 
($29,566). 
11. MOVEMENTS AFFECTING HIGHER CLASS SCHOOLS. 
While these efforts have been expended in the sphere of elementary 
education very important movements have taken place affecting the 
higher grades of education. An act of 1878 made provision for the 
Government inspection of higher class schools at the request of the 
respective boards and also increased their pecuniary resources. 
The sphere of Government inspection was extended by the educa- 
tional endowments act of 1882. This aet constituted a commission to 
draft schemes for the revision and reorganization of the educational 
endowments of Scotland, and required that each seheme should pro- 
vide for the periodical inspection by the department of the schools 
dealt with. The successive measures for systematizing the operations 
of higher schools were completed by an act of 1886, which defined the 
functions of the department in this respect. Three classes of higher

schools are now under inspection by the department: high schools the 
costs of whose inspection are partially defrayed from the public treasury, 
endowed schools which must pay the expenses from their endowments, 
and private schools applying for the privilege and paying the costs. 
Of the 54 secondary schools inspected in 1890, there were of the first 
class 23, of the second 22, and of private schools 9. The system has 
been completed by the institution of a leaving certificate examination, 
which indicates the standard attained by candidates, and is accepted 
in lieu of various professional examinations and for the preliminary 
examinations in both Scotch and English universities. The number 
of candidates for this certificate increased from 972 in1888 to 3,120 
in 1890. 
12. AUXILIARY AIDS TO EDUCATION. 
Educational associations.—Seotch teachers have not been unmindful 
of the advantages to be derived from union. The Educational Insti- 
tute was founded as early as 1841, and chartered three years later, 
with a membership of 1800. It now numbers 3,600 members and has 
an accumulated capital of about $10,000. Its discussions cover the 
entire province of education, but chiefly with reference to elementary 
instruction. : 
The Borough and Parochial Schoolmasters’ Association watches over 
the interests of teachers, and, among other measures having this end in 
view, maintains a fund for the widows of schoolmasters, amounting in 
1891 to £114,006 18s. 1d. This fund is kept up by annual contribu- 
tions ranging from £2 2s. to £5 5s. from each member of the associa- 
tion. 2 
The annual pensions allowed from it are of four grades, viz, £16 10s., 
£24 15s., £33, and £41 5s, 
In addition to these general societies, there is an association of head- 
masters of secondary schools. To the efforts of these societies must be 
attributed the beginning and much of the success of recent measures 
affecting popular education. : 
Women’s educational societies are numerous and have been particu- 
larly active in promoting the various phases of university extension. 
Among the most noted of these are the Glasgow and Edinburgh asso- 
ciations for promoting the higher education of women and the associa- 
tion for promoting the medical education of women. 
Since 1870 a great impetus has been given to secondary education in 
Edinburgh by the Merchant Company. The schools supported by the 
endowment of this company have been reorganized and afford now a 
very high order of training for both boys and girls at about half the 
usual charges. 
In 1891 these schools were attended by 6,362 pupils, under the con- 
trol of 280 teachers. "The value of the accumulated funds was £662,423 
($3,312,115), Of the income therefrom, £31,000 ($155,000) were ex-
-P-A-G-E-233

pended for teachers’ salaries. The extraordinary success of pupils 
from these schools in local examinations, competitive examinations 
for scholarships in both English and Scotch universites, and in civil 
service examinations is the best proof of their efficiency. 
Educational bequests.—Edueation has been fostered by many bequests 
for the promotion of secondary and superior instruction, or for popu- 
larizing special subjects. Reference has aiready been made to the most 
notable of these, 7. ¢., the Dick bequest, of which a somewhat extended 
account is given in the historical review.! This liberality follows many 
old precedents. 
Among the richest funds dealt with by the commission on educational 
endowments is the Heriot trust, Edinburgh, bequeathed by George He- 
riotin 1621, and yielding now an annual income of about £24,000 ($120,- 
000). In the reorganization of this endowment Edinburgh secures a fine 
technical school, the Watt Institution and School of Arts having been 
transferred to the “governors” of the fund. Henceforth the institution 
will be known as the Heriot-Watt College. It is very fully equipped 
with laboratories and will provide general and technical education for 
men and women. From the same fund a system of bursaries for the 
aid of poor students is established in the University of Edinburgh. 
In accordance with a scheme framed by the same commission, west 
Scotland secures also a fine institution, namely, the Glasgow and 
West of Scotland Technical College. This institution is formed by the 
- combination of ‘“‘Anderson’s College,” a scientific institution founded’ 
by bequest in 1795; the ‘“‘ Young chair of technical chemistry connected 
with Anderson’s University,” founded in 1870 by a bequest of £10,500; 
the “College of Science and Arts,” which originated in popular lectures 
instituted by Dr. Birkbeck in 1800; ‘Allan Glen’s Institution,” a 
school for practical education, endowed in 1847-48, and the “Atkin- 
son Institution,” founded in 1833, for the benefit of artisans. The or- 
der uniting these institutions bears date November 26, 1886. The 
medical school, which was instituted in 1799 as a department of An- 
derson’s College, was detached by the order and given a separate or- 
ganization. eee 
The Gilchrist educational trust was the bequest of Dr. Gilchrist, of 
Edinburgh, one of the beneficiaries of the Heriot Hospital. Having 
amassed a fortune by his talents and industry he emulated the spirit 
stamped upon his alma mater by devoting the bulk of his estate for 
the benefit, advancement, and propagation of education and learning 
in every part of the world. 
Dr. Gilchrist died in 1841. In 1865 his bequest was estimated at 
£100,000 ($500,000). The trustees have executed the wishes of the 
testator by establishing scholarships in Edinburgh, London, and other 
centers of learning, and by maintaining popular scientific lectures.

THE UNIVERSITIES OF SCOTLAND. 
The universities of Scotland have been more intimately related to 
the life of the common people than those of any other country. In this 
respect, even more if possible than in their constitution, they present a 
marked contrast to the English universities. To their democratic spirit 
may be traced many of the characteristics which differentiate the Scotch 
people and policies from those of England. To their widespread in- 
fiuence, to the ambitions which they awakened, and the opportunities 
which they brought within the-reach of the whole body of Scettish 
youth is due, in large measure, the independent and honorable part 
that Scotland has played in the history of the United Kingdom. 
This popular character of the universities has been fostered by the 
curriculum of the common schools; by the easy passage from the schools 
to the higher institutions; by the inexpensive mode of student life in 
the university towns, and by the great number of scholarship funds 
- available for the poor. These conditions, however, have not been 
without their disadvantages. Of these, the chief are the low entrance 
standards and the consequent forcing of preparatory instruction upon 
the university professors, the concentration of the forees of the uni- 
versities upon the training required for remunerative careers to the 
detriment of liberal education, and the neglect of those activities by 
which the province of knowledge is continually expanded. 
These are evils whose continuance would be fatal at the present 
time. Not only has the realm of attainable knowledge been vastly 
extended within this century, but what is even more patent to the 
Scoteh mind, its utilitarian applications have been greatly multiplied. 
Reform of the universities was not only necessary if Scotland would 
retain her reputation for general intelligence, but indispensable to the 
increase of her material resources and business prosperity. 
As a result of long-continued efforts a Scotch universities act was 
passed in 1889. This act provided for the reorganization of the four 
universities; for the elevation of their standards; the enrichment of 
their curricula, and the increase of their resources. An executive 
commission was appointed to draft ordinances for the accomplishment 
of these purposes. The work of the commission was finished Septem- 
ber, 1891, and its propositions are now undergoing the critical exami- 
nation of the university courts. Thus it appears that the universities 
are on the eve of important changes whose exact nature can not be 
stated at this moment. As regards the constitution of the universities, 
the most decided change effected by the act of 1889 relates to the uni- 
versity courts. 
- The governing bodies of the universities are in each, the senate 
(senatus academicus), the general council, and the university court. 
The council is a deliberative and advisory body. The senate, which 
consists of the principal and the professors, prior to the act of 1889 had 
 
-P-A-G-E-235
  - _ EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM OF SCOTLAND. 207" 
the administration of the financial affairs of the university, subject to 
the supervision of the court. ‘This power has now been transferred to 
the latter body, and the senate simply regulates teaching and disci- 
pline. The membership, as well as the authority of the courts, is in- 
creased by the recent act. The head of each university is the ehan- 
cellor, who is elected for life by the general council. All measures 
proposed or approved by the university court must receive his sanction, 
' Each university dlso has a rector, elected annually by the students (in 
Glasgow and Aberdeen this election has been by nations, a relic of 
the past, which will disappear in the new order). These officers are 
included in the organization of the eourts, and each nominates one 
additional member. Students, whether matriculates or alumni, have- 
heretofore had little part in the management of their universities. Re- 
cently they have taken vigorous measures to secure recognition in these 
matters. Following this initiative the commission was instructed to 
provide for the legal constitution of the newly formed students’ coun- 
cils and for their representation in the university courts. 
The Scottish universities are not like the English aggregations of 
colleges. The collegiate foundations existing originally at Aberdeen 
were meérged into each other by the universities act of 1858. Two of 
the three colleges of St. Andrews were united in 1747, the faculties of 
arts and medicine being assigned to them. Theology remained with 
the college of St. Mary, which has its own principal and its distinet 
organization. : 
The commissioners, under the universities act of 1889, have affiliated 
the university college of Dundee to St. Andrews. In this relation it is 
to retain its original character as a college for men and women, in which 
no religious test shall be required, either of professors or students. 
The other three universities, Glasgow, Aberdeen, and Edinburgh, com- 
' prise each the four faculties of arts, law, medicine, and theology. 
The universities send two representatives to Parliament, the general 
councils of Glasgow and Aberdeen being empowered to elect one and 
those of Edinburgh and St. Andrews the other. 
The Scotch universities have taken part in the popular movements 
of the last decade. They maintain local examinations for secondary 
schools and students. St. Andrews has been particularly active in 
promoting the higher education of women, having instituted the special 
degree of L. L. A. (lady literate in arts). Edinburgh also grants’a cer- 
tificate in arts to women. Aberdeen has recently appointed a lecturer 
on education, following thus the precedent set by Edinburgh and St. 
Andrews. E 
The four universities are united in a scheme of university extension. 
A committee of the senate of St. Andrews University has been formed 
for the purpose of aiding Scottish students in Paris and other French 
towns and of reviving the friendly relations which existed in the past 
between the universities of the two nations. Aberdeen is moving for. 
the restoration of its old buildings, famed for their architectural beauty,
-P-A-G-E-236
  208 EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
and, in common with the sister universities, is seeking means for in- 
ereased equipment for instruction in science. 
Edinburgh has been exceedingly fortunate in securing buildings 
and equipment suitable for the new demands. 
In 1873 a committee was formed and an appeal made to the public 
for subscriptions for the purpose. By this means £148,548 2s, 5d. were 
secured, which, with a grant of £80,000 received from Government, 
and interest, rents, and value received for old material, amounted to 
the sum of £244,587 4s, Sd. The university new buildings were be- 
gun in 1878 and par tly opened for teaching purposes in October, 1880. 
They were transferred by the committee to the university in Oe tober, 
1888. 
The building which will complete the group of the university new 
‘buildings, a school of medicine, is the M’7Ewan Hall, the gift of William 
WEwan, esq., M. P., Edinburgh. The hall will accommodate 3,000 
people and has been especially adapted te public ceremonials. Here 
degrees will be conferred, examinations conducted, and concerts, pub- - 
lic lectures, etc., be given. Provision has been made for the accommo- 
dation of an orchestra of over 300 performers and for a great organ. 
This hall was begun in 1889 and will prolably be completed in 1892." 
The university is now prospecting for a students’ hall, which will aid 
effectually in promoting social relations, the absence of which has been 
a serious disadvantage in the past. 
The salaries of professors vary greatly in the four universities, rang- 
ing, according to arecent return, from £234 ($1,170) to £3,450 ($17,250). 
The large amount of leisure ans left to many of the proiesbars adds to 
the value of their positions. 
The Scotch universities have but little revenue from properties or 
funds, deriving their income chiefly from fees and from the annual Pavr- 
liamentary grant. To the Government also they look for a large pro- 
portion of the funds required for new buildings and equipments. In 
1889 the grant for the four institutions was £19,025 ($95,125)

The university libraries appear to be flourishing. Glasgow reports. .

Among the most important proposals submitted by the commissioners 
appointed under the universities act, are those relating to the courses 
and degree requirements in divinity. These contemplate freeing the 
faculty from sectarian trammels, leaving this field to denominational: 
schools. The latter are numerous, the Free Church alone maintaining: 
14 theological colleges, with about 850 students, and from 50 to 60 
professors. : 
The commissioners also advocate the admission of women to gradua- 
tion in one or more faculties, and provision for their instruction. Of 
this proposition the Journal of Education says: 
Where and when possible there are to be full university privileges for women; 
meanwhile they are to be granted degrees after attending classes in recognized insti- 
tutions or under recognized teachers. At present, none of the universities have room 
for women in their class rooms, but with a stringent entrance examination they 
might have. But whatever practical arrangements may have to be made, the im- 
portant fact is that the commissioners have conceded all that is claimed by the 
advocates of university education for women. $ 
This ordinance is the logical outcome of the efforts of a company of 
women who with firm spirit and united powers have striven to break 
down the narrow prejudices of Scotch professors. 
Queen Margaret College, Glasgow, established in 1883, was one of 
the early triumphs of the Glasgow Association for Promoting the Higher 
Education of Women. To this a-medical school has recently been added. 
The Edinburgh association has long maintained classes to prepare 
women for the Edinburgh certificate in arts. g 
The liberal proposals of the commissioners are in striking contrast to 
the spirit manifested twenty years ago, when Miss Sophia Jex-Blake 
was forced to abandon the effort to secure her medical training in the 
Edinburgh faculty. 
The present status of the universities is set forth very clearly in the 
following review of the work of the commission, taken from the Lon- 
don Times of October 27, 1891:   
THE WORK OF THE SCOTTISH UNIVERSITIES COMMISSION, 
EDINBURGH, October 23. 
The Scottish University Commissioners have now issued a considerable number of 
draft ordinances, which are at present undergoing criticism from the university 
courts, the senates, and the general councils of the different universities, and from 
the press. The most important ordinances sent out down to the present time are 
those dealing with graduation in arts, graduation in science, and regulations for 
examinations in all the universities, and those dealing with graduation in medicine 
and the institution of a faculty of music in the University of Edinburgh. Of these 
ordinances that which ordains regulations for degrees in arts and for the constitu- 
ED 90. 14

    210 EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
tion of boards of studies is the most important, because it deals with that depart- 
ment or sphere of university work in which it is universally admitted that reform is 
most required. In none of the Scottish universities, for example, is there at present 
a@ compulsory entrance examination, while in all.of them there are elementary 
classes in Latin, Greek, and mathematics, which are simply rivals, under very un- 
fair conditions, of the secondary schools. 
Again, in most of the universities there are chairs in the faculty of arts which 
are placed at a great disadvantage because attendance cn them does not count for 
graduation. In the University of Edinburgh, for instance, there are cighteen chairs 
in the faculty of arts, but only seven of these are of any account in connection with 
the granting of degrees. These are the grievances which call most clamantly for 
redress, Another grievance is that the college session lasts only for six months in 
the year and that no use is made of the summer months; while itis a further com- 
plaint that the professors enjoy a monopoly of teaching, and that no recognition is 
given to cxtra-mural or privat docent teaching. It is admitted that the draft ordi- 
nance just issued meets most of_these objections to a certain extent. It institutes 
an entrance examination; it provides for a summer session; it provides, or appears 
to proyide, a wide varicty of options in the subjects or ¢lasses qualifying for a de- 
gree. On the other hand, it is objected to the ordinance that its concessions to the 
demands of university reformers are more apparent than real, Even the professors 
in most. eases, and some of them very vehemently, object to the entrance examina- 
tion on the ground that its standard is too low and that its op ion would bo 
fatal to secondary schools, while it would depress rather than elevate the standard 
within the universities. In mathematics, for example, the amount and the standard 
of work are lower than those for the leaving certificate of the Scotch education co- 
partment, applicable to secondary schools. 
Again, the variety of options proposed for the degree examinations is to a largo 
extent illusory. Of the seven subjects to be required for the degree, five are com- 
pulsory, and these five must be taken from the seven which at present enjoy a mo- 
nopoly, with the addition of chemistry and modern languages, for the latter of which 
no provision is at present made within the universities. The result is that out of an 
imposing list of twenty-five optional subjects, the candidate has absolute freedom 
of choice in the case of only two. The arrangements for the proposed summer ses- 
sion arc also deemed unsatisfactory. The professors are to have the first right of 
teaching the classes, failing whom, the right is to pass to their assistants, and abs 
_lutely no provision is made for recognizing teaching graduates or extra-mural 
classes, This is the more remarkable because, in connection with the medical fac- 
ulty in Edinburgh, the courses of extra-mural teachers are at present recognized to 
a large extent, and are proposed to be recognized to a still larger extent under the 
new ordinance of the commissioners. It is difficult to understand why they should 
be so liberal in connection with medicine and so conservative in connection with 
arts. The regulations for the degree in arts with honors are held to present un- 
neeessary limitations and complications. The student can not, as at present, go in 
for honors after passing the examination for the ordinary degree, but must take an 
independent course in one or more of five groups of subjects; and this would co 
pel him to decide, at an early period in his course, whether he should take an ordi- 
nary or an honors degree. The candidate, moreover, is required to take a certain 
number of subjects in which there are senior or honors classes, which is another 
means of perpetuating monopoly, as such classes exist only ii connection with tho 
chairs that are at present privileged. 
The ordinance on graduation in medicine applies only to Edinburgh, and it is ad- 
mitted to be. on the whole very liberal in its provisions, especially as it increases to 
some extent, as has. just been said, the number of extra-mural classes recognized as 
qualifying for a degree. But it provides, no remedy for the admitted evil of large 
classes, or for the very objectionable system under which a professor who draws from 
£2,000 to £3,000 a year from his chair devolves a large amount of the teaching, and 
    
      
      
     
-P-A-G-E-239
    : EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM OF SCOTLAND. 2 Ee 
nearly all the practical work, on assistants who are miserably paid and who haye 
no academic status. ‘There is no provision for dividing overgrown chairs, or for ap- 
pointing assistant professors, or for drawing extra-mural teachers into the univer- 
sity system, although some of these points may possibly be dealt with in future 
ordinances, Neither is there any provision for giving to extra-mural teachers a share 
in the examination, a duty which they would be glad te perform without remanera- 
tion as a condition of their recognition as university teachers. 
The tendency, 
is to reduce the science degree from the rank of an honors degree, which it holds a 
present, to the rank of an ordinary or pass degree. ‘This, in the opinion of many 
persons, would not be objectionable, seeing that the doctorate of science would be 
retained to mark the higher or honors gra xde. There are, however, two weighty 
objections taken to the ordinance, which can not be so easily met. The one is that 
no sufficient distinction is made between attainments in pure science and attain- 
ments in technical science. Engineering and agriculture are put on precisely the 
samo footing as mathematics and astronomy. The other objection is that the cur- 
riculum in science so overlaps the curriculum in arts, which contains science options, 
that it would be possible for a student to take two degrees (those of x and B.S 
by passing the same, or nearly the same, set of examinations in two faculties. If 
this is possible, it is a serious objection to the ordinance; it ought clgarly: to bemade 
impossible. 
The ordinance for the institution of a faculty of music applies, like that on medi- 
cine, only to the University of Edinburgh, which enjoys in the Reid bequest a fund 
specially applicabic to musical education and culture. The foundation has hitherto, 
in the opinion of most persons, been flagrantly abused. The sum of £600 a yearhas 
been spent annually on the encouragement of music; but there has been seareely 
any teaching of music, and very little tangible result in any other form, though 
there has been a professor of music, with a well-appointed music class-room and 
fine apparatus at his command. The ordinance provides that the professor of mu- 
sic shall give the ruction in the subjects qualifying for graduation during the 
- winter session only, and that he shall organize orchestral and other concerts in Ed- 
inburgh. But these things do not amount to more than the professor of music has 
been supposed to do in the past. Yet nothing, or next to nothing, has been done. 
What is required is some systematic regulation under which a school of music may 
be o: nized, with theoretical and practical teaching, and with a scheme of gradu- 
ation corr ronnie thereto. A great deal must necessarily depend on the pro- 
fessor of music. The chair is now vacant, and it may be hoped that the next 
appointmenc will be made with a special view to the higher objects referred to 
      
    
  
        
     
    
        above. 
The ordinance on regulations as to examinations is one of the most useful that 
the commissioners have issued. It proposes the appointment of a board of exam- 
iners for. the preliminary examinations in arts, science, and medicine, to which the 
four universities shall contribute in equal proportions, namely, one professor or 
lecturer and two additional examiners from each, who shall be appointed by the 
university court. The object of this arrangement is to secure that a uniform stand- 
ard of entrance may be maintained in all the four universities. The scheme of ro- 
tation extending over four years is characterized by the utmost fairness, each sub- 
ject being represented in each year by a professor in one university and by two ad- 
ditional examiners from other universities. The only objection which the very 
critical committee of the Edinburgh general council has been able to take to the 
penance as it standsis that it gives a power of selection tothe senatus which, in their. 
opinion, ought to be given to the university court. On a review of the situation, 
as a whole, it may be said that the principles of the ordinances of the tommissien- 
ers are very generally approved, but that material amendments are required in de- 
tails in order to make them thoroughly acceptable to the universities and to all who 
~ are interested in their improvement.

Schools and educational systems grow out of the general conditions 
of the life of a people, and their history is closely related to that of all | 
other national manifestations. Nevertheless, viewed in retrospect, 
this history may often be traced as a distinct stream in the national 
current. This is especially true of Scotland, whose scheols and school 
laws seem almost always to have been in advance of the general deyel- 
opment. 
From the earliest records relating to schools to the date of the pas- 
sage of the education act of 1872 seven centuries elapsed. As regards 
education, they may be divided into four periods. While not separated 
from each other by rigid lines, each of these periods made a distinetive 
contribution to that totality, the edueational system of Scotland. 
An outline view of these periods is here presented, accompanied by 
‘detailed statements and citations from authorities which confirm or 
- illustrate the view advanced. 
  PrEnRiop oF CATHOLIC SUPREMACY, TWELFTH TO SIXTEENTH 
B CENTURY. 
  I.—ORIGIN OF SCHOOLS, 
As is the ease with other European systems of education, that of 
_ Scotland traces its beginning to schools established by the Catholic 
church in the centuries preceding the Reformation, that is, between the 
twelfth and sixteenth centuries. This period of ecclesiastical supremacy 
was not wanting in intimations of that civic concern for education, 
which became later the marked characteristic of the country, and one 
in respect to which Scotland anticipated the general progress of Euro- 
-pean policies. It was manifested in the action of the magistrates and 
"councils of burghs in establishing schools. Those, it is true, were sub- 
ject to clerical control, but the right of the civil authorities to a voice 
in the conduct of the schools which they established was never entirely 
ignored. The early manifestation in the burghs is the more remarkable 
because it was not accompanied by the conditions of population, in- 
dustrial art, commerce, or security which usually attend this form of 
civic activity. 
I.—(a) Schools of the period preceding the Reformation.—The schools established dur- 
ing this period were chiefly grammar or classical schools, designed to prepare their 
students for the service of the church or for the administration of government. 
- The church also maintained ‘sang schools” to train boys for choir service, and lec- 
turo or reading schools in which children were taught to read their mother tongue.

  HISTORICAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION IN SCOTLAND. rae 
T1.— FOREIGN INFLUENCE, 
To the zeal of the church and the sense of publie responsibilities in 
burghs, there were added, as a fruitful source of educational provision, 
the gifts of nobles and kings, which were prompted by a mingling of 
religious sentiment and public spirit. Through these channels, and 
especially through the disposition of the royal houses, the influence of 
other nations made itself felt in that northern kingdom. The Scottish 
kings desired to reproduce in their dominions the conditions that gave | 
strength and luster to their rivals. Foreign influences also made 
themselves felt in the freedom of thought which asserted itself against: 
the arbitrary and repressive supervision of the church. Liberty of 
instruction was contended for by teachers fresh from university asso- 
ciations on the continent, more especially by those from the University 
of Paris, which stood forth as the special champion of intellectual lib- 
erty. It was foreign teachers who first broke down the exclusive 
character and limited range of studies which made up the classical 
curriculum allowed by the church. This was confined to Latin and 
was but little developed on the literary side. The rectors and masters 
of the schools, who at first were clergy or candidates for clerical honors, 
‘Dame schools” for the same elementary work were quite numerous, and apparently 
independent of church supervision, 
References to the grammar or classical schools are found in documents as early as _ § y 
1100.—{Grant’s History of the Burgh Schools of Scotland, p. 2.] 
The first of these schools were established in connection with monasteries. Burgh 
schools, created by the magistrates and by private benefactions, were numerous be- 
fore the Reformation, Of 53 public schools included in the report of the education 
~ commission on burgh and middle-class schools (1868), 12 at least were in existence 
prior to 1560, 
  (b) Particular schools—Individual schools and schoolmasters acquired more than, 
local renown and attracted large companies of students. In 1550 Andrew Simpson, 
famous as a master and author of the “Latin Rudiments,” was at the head of the 
grammar school at Perth, where he had sometimes three hundred boys under his 
charge, including sons of the nobility and gentry.—[Special report on burgh and.     middle class schools of Scotland, p. 233; see also account of Montrose Academy, p. 
27; Brochinburgh School, p. 34; Dundee High School, p. 44; Dumbarton Academy, 
p- 127; i Edinburgh High Sshcabat 208; Aberdeen Grammar Sheol . 274; Glasgow 
High School, p. 304.] 
In his history of Dundee, Dr. Small says: ‘About the death of Alexander IIT, 1286, 
Wallace was pursuing his scholastic studies at Dundee, which at this early period was 
famous for the excellence of its seminaries, a circumstance that induced many of the — 
nobility and gentry to send their children thither from a far distance to complete = 
their classical studies.”—[For notices of the elementary schools see McCrie’s Life of 
Melville, p. 361; History of the Burgh Schools of Scotland, by James Grant, M. A., 
pp. 63, 64.] 
(ce) Supervision of clergy.—Oftentimes the chaplain of a noble house was the master i 
of the school founded by his patron. In the Brechinburgh School these offices were 
united, 1717.—[Report on middle-class schools in Scotland, p. 34.] 
' An assistant master of the Montrose school, which McCrie calls a private semi- 
nary, is said to have been driven into banishment in 1538, by the Bishop of Brechin, 
for teaching his scholars the Greek testament. The grammar school at Edinburgh
-P-A-G-E-244
  216 EDUCATION: REPORT, 1889-90. 
enjoyed peculiar estcem, and this in time attached to the teaching 
profession irrespective of clerical relations. 
The educational history assumes a distinctive character in the fif- 
teenth century. James I brought: from his captivity in England 
(1405-1424), with its episodes of journeyings in France, the passion for 
literature and learning, which was created in England by Wickliff and 
Chaucer, and maintained in France by the influence both of the court 
and of the universities. 
The desire of the Scottish King to awaken this spirit in his own 
Kingdom was evidenced during his captivity by his endeavors to secure 
therein the foundation of a university. This purpose was accomplished 
directly by Henry Wardlaw, bishop of St. Andrew, who obtained the 
consent of Parliament for the foundation of St. Andrews University, 
in 1411. This, and the sister universities which followed quickly, i. e., 
~ Glasgow, 1450, and Aberdeen, 1494, show that Scotland was not en- 
-tirely untouched by the movement toward intellectual and spiritual 
emancipation which swept over middle and southern Europe. 
was supported by the town council, but that body appears to have taken no active 
part in its management-until 1562, when they made an appeal to the Earl of Murray, 
who held the patronage of the school, for the removal of an ‘ obstinate papist 
master.—[Jbid., p. 203.] 
(ad) The burghs.— There were burghs of barony, free burghs, burghs of regality, 
and royal burghs. Since 1832 there have been what are called Parliamentary 
burghs, that is, towns or burghs not being royal burghs, but sending or contribut- 
ing to send representatives to Parliament. By the general police act of Scotland, 
the word burgh is declared to mean also, any populous place, the boundaries of 
which are fixed by the act.”—[Chambers Encyclopedia, Vol. 2, p. 434.] 
As to the state of the Scottish burghs in the fourteenth century, see Buckle’s 
History of Civilization in England, Vol. 11, Chap. 1. 
IL.—(a) Influence of foreign teachers.—It is interesting to note in connection with 
efforts for the “liberty of instruction,” that in the University of Glasgow John 
Knox came under the influence of John Mair (1520-22), who had been both student 
and professor in the University of Paris.—[McCrie’s Life of Knox, pp. 3-5.] 
[For spirited account of the resistance of the Paris University to the authority of 
the Jesuits, see monograph by M. A. Douarches, published by Hachette & Co., 
Paris.] 
(b) Introduction of Greek.—Says McCrie, in his life of John Knox: ‘There were 
unquestionably learned Scotsmen in the early part of the sixteenth century ; but most 
of them owed their chief acquirements to the advantages of a foreign education. 
Those improvements which the revival of literature had introduced into the schools 
of Italy and France were long in reaching the universities of Scotland, though origi- 
nally formed upon their model; and when they did arrive they were regarded with a 
suspicious eye, more especially by the clergy. The principal branches cultivated in 
our universities were the Aristotelian philosophy, scholastic theology, with canon 
and civillaw. The schools erected in the principal towns of the Kingdom afforded 
the means of instruction in the Latin tongue, the knowledge of which in some de- 
gree was requisite for enabling the clergy to perform the religious service. But the 
Greek language, long after it had been enthusiastically studied on the continent, 
and after it had become a fixed branch of education in the neighboring kingdoms, 
continued to be almost unknown in Scotland. Individuals acquired the knowledge

Ill.—POLICY OF JAMES Iy. 
, The court of Janes IV (1488-1513) reflected:in no small measure the 
rising spirit of the Renaissance; foreign scholars were welcomed to its 
midst, a printing press was set up in Edinburgh, which gave permanent 
form to the works of native poets, and a true passion for letters devel- 
oped. The determination of the sovereign to rescue his country from 
ignorance and barbarity is not matter of tradition merely. 
Compulsory statute.—A. statute of his reign, bearing date 1494, orders_ 
all barons and freeholders to put their sons and heirs at school “from 
6 or 9 years of age, and keep them there until they should have perfect 
Latin, under a penalty of £20.” After being perfected in Latin, the 
young men were enjoined to remain three years longer at the schools 
of “art and jure.” This was, apparently, the first attempt at com- 
pulsory education in Europe. Its effects would naturally be the dif- 
fusion of learning and culture among the ruling classes; and it was 
undoubtedly intended by the sovereign as a means of subduing the 
    
of it abroad, but the first attempts to teach it in this country were of a private na- 
ture, and exposed their patrons to the suspicion of heresy. The town of Montrose is 
distinguished by being the first place, so far as Lhave-heen able to discover, in which 
Greek was taught in Scotland, and John Erskine of Dun is entitled to the honor of 
being regarded as the first of his countrymen who patronized the study of that polite 
~ and useful language. As early as the year 1534 that enlightened and public-spirited 
baron on returning from his travels brought with him a Frenchman skilled in the 
Greek tongue, whom he settled in Montrose; and upon his removal he liberally en- 
couraged others to come from France and succeed to his place. From this private 
seminary many Greek scholars proceeded, and the knowledge of the language was 
gradually diffused throughout the Kingdom. After this statement I need scarcely 
add that the oriental tongues were at that time utterly unknown in Scotland. It 
was not until the establishment of the Reformation that Hebrew began to be studied, 
and John Row. was the first who taught it, having opened a class for this purpose in 
tho year 1560, immediately upon his settlement as minister in Perth. From that 
time the knowledge of Greek and the Eastern languages advanced among our coun- 
trymen witha rapid pace.”—[Life of Knox, p. 3; also notes, pp. 334-337.] 
(ec) University of St. Andrews.—In 1413 this foundation was ratified by papal. bull. 
So great was the joy at this event that upon the return of the official who had been 
sent to receive the bull the clergy of the bishopric, four hundred in number, marched 
in solemn procession to the high altar, where the Te Deum was sung, and the citizens 
gave themselves up to festivity and joy.—[Grant’s History of Burgh Schools, p. 15.] 
“The University of St. Andrews was formed on the model of those of Paris and 
Bologne. Allits members or supports, as they were called, including the students 
who had attained the degree of bachelor as well as the masters, were divided into 
nations, according to the places from which they came. The nations were those of 
Fife, Angus, Lothian, and Albany, which last included all who did not belong to 
any of the three former districts.” 
The university had civil and criminal jurisdiction over its members and possessed. 
also ecclesiastical power, in the exercise of which it sometimes proceeded to excom- 
munication. The first college of the university, St. Salvator, was founded in 1458; 
the second, St. Leonard, 1512; the third, St. Mary’s, or New College, 1554.—[See 
MeCric’s Life of Melville, Vol. 1, chapter v, which is occupied entirely with an account

fierce and warlike spirit of his barons, and fitting them to bear their 
part in a peaceful and well-organized society. It contemplated the 
discipline of the grammar schools, and the training of the newly-_ 
founded universities whose correlation was thus early indicated, as it 
has since been jealously maintained in Scotland. | 
The advantages of classical schools were not, however, entirely con- 
fined to the sons of the nobility and gentry, provision being often 
made by gifts, bequests, etc., for the attendance of poor lads of good 
promise. 
IV.—DAWN OF THE REFORMATION. 
A growing interest in learning is reflected in the literature of the 
time. It was an interest fostered by the influence of the Lollards, 
“whose doctrines gained adherents in Scotland in the early part of the 
fifteenth century. Before its close the Reformation had become a spir- 
- itual force in Scotiand and had given indications of the power which it 
_ up by Knox and his associates in 1560, Tho parish school—i. ¢., school in connect was to exercise in the political development of the nation. ‘The last 
legislative act of the period, which for convenience has been considered 
the first in the educational history, has affinity with the period of 
the Reformation. This was an act of Parliament passed in 1542 grant- 
  
of this university. Chapters 1, 11, and Iv give interesting particulars of Glasgow 
and Aberdeen. ] 
Ill.—Siatute of 1494.—This statute assumes, as qbuitad? out by Mr. Grant, the ex- 
istence of enough schools to make its execution possible. 
The purpose which animated the legislation is plainly stated in the act, namely, 
“that justice may reign universally throughout the realm, and that those who are 
sheriffs or judges may have knowledge to do justice, so that the poor people should 
have no need to see our sovereign lord’s principal auditors for every little injury.”— 
[History of Burgh Schools, p. 26.]

doctrines in Scotland, see ‘‘ McCrie’s Life of John Knox,” pp. 18-21. (b) For evidence 
of the spirit manifested in contemporary literature, see ‘“‘Complaynt of the Papyngo,” 
by Sir David Lyndsay, 1530. 
V. Scheme drawn up by John Knox.—The scheme of education is set forth in ‘*Tho 
First Book of Discipline or the Policy of Discipline of the Church,” which was drawn 
      ion 
with every ‘“kirk”—was not intended for elementary instructi s only, but comprised 
grammar and Latin. The colleges in towns were intended as higher schools for in- 
struction in arts, logic, rhetoric, and languages. The rich, it is declared, should be 
“compelled to educate their sons at their own expense, but the children of the poor 
should be supported at the charge of the church, the sons of rich and poor alike, 
if they have aptness for leariing, continuing at the schools until the commonwealth 
have profited of them.”—[MeCrie’s Life of John Knox, p. 186; Grant’s History of 
Burgh Schools, p. 77.] 
There were regulations also for the three universities, which, says McCrie, dis- 
cover an enlightened regard to the interests of literature, and may suggest hints 
which deserve attention inthe presentage. Among other proposals it was suggested 
“<that there should be a reader of Greek’ in one of the colleges of each university, 
‘who shall complete the grammar thereof in three months,’ and shall interpret some 
book of Plato, together with some places of the New Testament, and shall complete 
his course the samo year.’ ”—[Life of Knox, p. 335. J Of this educational scheme of

the vernacular and freely circulated and read. The Bible in the mother 
tongue marks in Scotland, as in other countries, the first step in that 
“movement which has become a marked characteristic of modern states, 
4. e. popular education.    
SECOND PERIOD 1560-1696. 
The transition from a Catholic to a Presbyterian state was, it may 
be said, legally effected by the passage of an act in 1560, depriving the 
Catholic Church of its power and repealing every statute in its favor. 
The actual replacement of the old order by the new was accomplished, 
however, by bitter and violent ‘conflicts, lasting more than a century. 
The history of education during this period reflects the successive — 
triumphs, defeats, and persistent progress of the Reformation. 
V.—EDUCATIONAL SCHEME OF THE REFORMERS. 
Education was a leading feature of the scheme of government which 
John Knox drew up, and the agency upon which he counted for its 
  
the Reformers, Dr. Laurie says: ‘It is worthy of remark that all the leading aims 
and principles which characterized Scottish education, and still characterizes it, 
were embodied in the first formal public document dealing with the subject asa 
matter of national policy. The external organization of schools, the democratic ~ 
universality of the proposed system, the religious purpose which was to animate the — 
teaching, the provision for the free education of the poor, the institution of bursa- 
ries to carry boys of promising talents into the higher walks of life, compulsion 
where necded, and the professional character of the universities, all tl things 
were propounded by the Reformers, and they still form the text of all our educational- 
utterances on the platform and in the press.”—[Dick Bequest, report by 8 aurie,     
   
       
  reamble to the Confession of Faith, which was drawn up before.the Book 
the reason: for the great stress laid upon education is set forth. Tn 
gs asserted to be ‘‘the office and duty of the godly magistrate * * * to 
provide, at the utmost of his power how [the Church of God] may abide in some 
purity in the posterity following.” The sta ains, should be ‘‘ most eare- 
ful for the virtuous education and godly upbringing of the youth of the realm.” 
No father, of whatsoever estate or condition, is to be allowed to bring up his chil- 
dren according to his own fantasic, but all must be compelled to bring up their 
children in learning and virtue.—[Dick Bequest, pp. 1, 2.] 
E The clergy counted upon the sequestered properties of the Romish Church for 
funds to establish and maintain the schools, but these had been gobbled up by the 
nobles, who successfully resisted the repeated applications to Parliament for resti- 
tution.—[Public Education, by Sir James Kay Shuttleworth, p. 323; second report 
of the Education Commission, 1867, p. xxvi.] 
Vi.—The spirit of the act of 1646 is shown by the following extract: ‘Consider- 
ing how prejudicial the want of schools in many congregations hath been, and how 
beneficial the providing thereof will be to the kirk and kingdom, do therefore stat- 
ute and ordain, that there be a school founded and a schoolmaster appointed in 
every parish (not already provided) by advice of the presbyteries; and to this pur- 
pose, that the heritors in every congregation meet among themselves, and provide

maintenance. The ideals which the previous age dimly suggested were 
here expanded and voiced as the distinct ends of a well-ordered system, 
This comprehended a graded series of institutions, “in every parish a 
school, in every notable town a college correlated to the universities,” 
universal provision for education, compulsory attendance upon. the pro- 
vision, and the strong, intelligent, righteous power of the church guid- 
ing and controlling the entire work. Itwas a grand but arbitrary pur- 
pose, and its immediate and complete success would have shut Scotland 
within the narrowest spiritual boundaries that have ever been imposed 
upon a people. 
The realization of this plan was, however, prevented by the lack of 
funds and by the universal turmoil. It was only piece by piece, and 
with continual and liberalizing modifications brought about by chang- 
ing conditions, that the policy for which Knox contended was en- 
grafted upon the nation. 
In 1567, the year in which the Reformed religion was established by 
law, the control of schools was transferred from the Catholic bishops 
to the presbyteries by an act of Parliament. 
a commodious house for a schoole, and modifie a stipend to the schoolmaster, which 
shall not be under one hundred merks nor above twa hundred merks, to be paid 
yearly at two terms,” etc. For payment of this salary the heritors were to stent 
everyone’s stock and teind proportionally; and on their failure to provide a school 
- and salary, the presbytery was authorized to ‘‘nominate twelve honest men within 
the bounds, who shall have the power to establish a schoole, modifie a stipend for 
the schoolmaster, and set down a stent for the heritors, which shall be as valid as 
if done by themselves.”—[Quoted from Dunlop’s Parochial Law, by Sir James Kay 
Shuttleworth, Public Education, p. 325.] 
VII.—The original charters of the foundation of the University of Edinburgh were 
all made in favor of the provost magistrates and council of the city of Edinburgh. 
» They confer on them all powers with respect to the foundation, including the exclu- 
sive privilege of electing the principal and professors and determining their duties, 
and removing them when it seemed expedient.—[Report of Royal Commission of In- 
quiry into the state of the Universities of Scotland, 1831, p. 14.] 
The new foundation was in fact only the College of Edinburgh, or the town’s col- 
lege. It was founded by the town. council of Edinburgh under the general powers to 
found educational institutions granted to them by the charter of King James VI, 
dated April 14, 1582. From the first, the college possessed the privilege of confer- 
ring degrees.—[Edinburgh University Calendar, 1891-’92, p. 9.] 
VIII.—The opinion is expressed by Dr. Laurie that from about 1633 onwards Scot- 
land was pretty well provided with the means of elementary education, save in out- 
lying or thinly peopled districts.—[Dick Bequest, p.5.] 
It was, however, after the revolution of 1688 that Andrew Fletcher, of Saltoun, 
published the pamphlet in which he urged a system of slavery as a remedy for “the 
ignorance, idleness, and lawlessness of the common people of his country.” As 
pointed out by Macaulay, it was but a few months after the publication of this pam- 
phlet that Parliament passed the ‘‘ Act for the settlement of schools.”—[Speech de- 
livered in the House of Commons, April 19, 1847, on the proposition to increase the 
Government grant for education to £100,900. ] 
IX.—(a) The church courts—The church exercised its authority through its courts, 
‘which were as follows: (1) The kirk session, composed of the ministers, elders, and
-P-A-G-E-249
7 HISTORICAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION. IN SCOTLAND. 221 
The failure of the Reformers to get possession of the sequestered 
properties of the Catholic church for the purposes of education left the 
maintenance of schools to the voluntary contributions of the church. 
This, although an uncertain and inadequate source of support, served 
to kindle the enthusiasm of congregations which, in the lowlands at 
least, was tantamount to a popular interest in the schools. 2 
It was, perhaps, as a concession to the general spirit, that in 1616, 
during a brief episode of episcopal supremacy, the Privy Council lent 
itself to the accomplishment of the fundamental part of Knox’s scheme, 
by directing the establishment of a school in every parish where prac- 
ticable, at the expense of the parishioners. This act would possess 
little significance but for its outcome. In 1633 it was ratified by Par- 
liament with the additional proviso that the bishop of a parish acting 
with the consent of the heritors, and most part of the parishioners, 
should have the power to impose a “stent” for the support of the. 
schools. Thus in lieu of the coveted church properties, events had 
worked to that most fruitful of all sources: of school supply, a local 
tax. 
deacons of a congregation; (2) the presbytery, composed of the ministers and an 
equal number of lay members in a district; this body had control over the kirk ses- 
sions; (3) the provincial synod, composed of ministers and delegated elders from the 
presbyteries of a district; (4) the general assembly, consisting of ministers and elders 
from all the presbyteries. This body attended to the interests of the whole church. 
The presbyteries, it willbe seen, were the authoritative bodies. Their control of indi- 
vidual churches was absolute, and the general assembly was formed from their mem- 
bership. These relations were defined in the Second Book of Discipline, which was 
compiled in 1578.—[See McCrie’s Life of John Knox, p. 185.] ; 
(b) Provisions of the act of 1696.—By the new act the ‘King, with the advice and 
consent of the estates of Parliament, statutes and ordains that there shall be a school 
settled and established and a schoolmaster appointed in every parish not already 
provided, by the advice of the heritors and minister of the parish.” The heritors 
were bound by the act to provide acommodious schoolhouse and a salary not above 
200 merks (#50) nor under 100 merks ($25), Each heritor was to be assessed in pro- 
portion to his valued rent, but might seek relief from his tenants to the extent of 
one-half. In case of disagreement among the heritors of a parish, the presbytery 
were ordered to apply tothe commissioners of supplies.—[Report of the Education 
Commission, p. XxXvii.] 
X.—(a) The act of 1803 provided with respect to schoolmasters. 
A (1) As to emolitments.—A maximum salary of 400 marks ($111), or double the 
amount fixed in 1696, and a minimum salary of 300 marks ($83.25), triple the former 
minimum. Revision of salaries was ordered at the expiration of every twenty-five 
years. 
(2) As to accommodation.—Beside a suitable schoolhouse, the heritors were bound 
io provide a dwelling house with garden attached; in case no garden ground could be 
obtained a money indemnity was to be paid. In addition to these allowances the 
masters continued to receive the school fees. 
(3) As to election and qualifications.—The election of the masters was still left to the 
heritors and ministers as one body, but no heritor was to be entitled to vote in school 
matters who was not a proprietor of lands within the parish to the extent of at 
least £100 (Scots) of valued rent appearing in the land-tax books of the county. In

    VL—ACT OF 1646, PROVIDING FOR A SYSTEM OF EDUCATION. 
It was in the midst of the civil war, however (1646), that an act was 
passed which comprised all the essential features of a system of educa- 
tion, namely: (1) Authorized and authoritative supervision, the ma- 
chinery or instrumentalities consisting at that time of the clergy; (2) 
~ provision of schoolhouses and teachers’ salaries, a charge imposed upon 
the “heritors” or landowners of parishes; (3) the principle of eommon 
taxation for school purposes—i.c., an assessment wpon each “heritor” 
in proportion to his valued rent, for one-half of which he might obtain 
relicf from his tenants—a provision not far removed from the policy of 
a general school tax; (4) the principle of compulsion reaffirmed so far 
as parents were concerned, and also applied to those upon whom the 
obligation rested to provide schools, authority being given to county 
officers to set up a school and impose the tax upon the landowners—i. ¢., 
 heritors—in the case of their failing to discharge their duty. 
    VIIL.—FOUNDING OF THE UNIVERSITY OF BDINBURGH, 
During this period the resources of higher education were enriched 
by the founding of the University of Edinburgh. It was created by     
  
ease the heritors failed to elect, the duty devolved upon the commissioners of supply 
of the county within which the school was located. Schoolmasters-eleet were to be 
examined and approved by the presbyteries, and were required to sign the Confes- 
_ sion of Faith and the formula of the Church of Scotland. 
(4) As to discipline.—Charges of neglect of duty, immoral conduct, or cruel or im- 
proper treatment of scholirs on the part of the schoolmaster could be brought by 
the hervitors, ministers, and elders before presbyteries. In ease the ¢harges wero 
sustained, these bodies had power to censure, suspend, or dismiss the offenders. 
As to management and superintendence of schools.—‘ Presbyteries are empowered 
to regulate the hours of teaching, and the length of the annual vacation; and their 
regulations on these points the schoolmaster is required to observe under pain of 
censure, suspension, or deprivation.” 
The course of study was arranged by the ministers and heritors, and included 
religion. 
C, Respecting additional school provision.—The act provided that in case of those par- 
ishes which consist of districts detached from each other by the sea or arms of the 
sea, or otherwise, as where a parish consists of two or more islands, of which there are 
ral instances in the Highlands, North Isles, and Hebrides, or where it is otherwise 
at extent or population, so that one parochial school can not be of any efieetual 
benefit to the whole inhabitants of such parishes, it shall be competent to the heritors 
x, if they shall see cause, on fixing asalary of 600 marks, or the value of three 
~ chalders of outmeal, to be computed according to the provisions of this act, ta divide 
the same among two or more teachers according to the extent and population of the 
parish. In consideration of the higher salary to be raised by the heritors of such 
parishes, they were exempted from the obligation to provide schoolhouses, dwell- 
ing houses, and gardens. The schools established under this clause were known as 
side schools. ‘The act continued the superintendence of schools in the ministers of 
the established church, But, in reality, although the minister of each parish exer- 
cised this fanction, the real pewer over the schools was vested in the presbyteries. 
D. Provision for poor children.—The schoolmasters were allowed to charge fees. 
Neyertheiess, the act of 1803 imposed upon them the obligation to teach gratis such

royal charter granted in 1582, by James VI, to the magistrates of the 
city, who for a quarter of a century had been working to that purpose. 
.Thus by the circumstances of its origin, this latest of the Scottish 
universities belonged to the influences which were destined to effect 
the removal of scholastic institutions from ecclesiastical control. 
VIII.—DISASTROUS EFFECTS OF PROLONGED CONTESTS.- 
The aet of 1646, repealed though it was at the restoration, is the dis- 
ctive contribution of the pericd under review to the cause of edu- 
     
trous consequences of the conflicts by which the country was torn. 
Notwithstanding the multiplication of schools, there are not wanting 
nees that incessant warfare and hostile incursions had reduced a 
large proportion of the people of Scotland to a state of semibarbarism. 
Phis alarming condition called for active measures beyond the plane 
of inert legislation. * 
    THIRD PERIOD, 1696—1847, 
The accession of William and Mary supplied the conditions required 
for practical reforms. The Presbyterian Church was firmly established 
  children as the heritors and ministers might recommend. (Second report of 
sion, pp. XXVIII, XXX, LX.) : 
(0) Act of 1835,—In 1835 the education committee of the. general assembly pre- 
sented a memorial to the Government asking, among other things, for a grant from 
the public funds toward the establishment of schools in destitute parts of the high- 
Jands and islands. These negotiations led to the passing of an act. the same year 
which provided for the payment of salaries to schoolmasters for certain distr: in 
the highlands and islands which had been disunited and formed into parishes quoad 
sacra, on condition that the heritors of such parish or district shall, at their own ex- 
penso or otherwise, provide suitable school buildings. The schools erected under 
the provision of this act were known as Parliamentary schools. They were sub- 
ject to the same condition as parochial schools, the source from whieh the salary 
was derived alone excepted. ‘The amount of salary in each case was proportioned to 
the outlay incurred in providing the buildings. (Second report of commission, p. 
EXXVU.)    
  The dearth of school provision in highland regions excited alarm long before the 
statute of 1803 made special provision for them, but to the Protestant mind this was 
less deplorable than the fact that there were still strongholds of the Romish Church. 
(c) Voluntary Sodiety—The chief of the voluntary societies, i. ¢., The Society for 
Progagating Christian Knowledge, had been formed as early as 1701, for work in the 
Highland regions. It was countenanced and assisted by the general assembly, as 
well as by private subscriptions, gifts, ete. Its resources gradually increased, and 
by the end of the period under review it was able to act independently of public aid,   
haying an annual revenue of £5,000 ($25,000) from its accumulated capital. (Public. ; 
Education, by Sir James Kay Shuttleworth, p. 351.) 
XI—Sessional schools.—Session schools were established generally in connection with 
chapels which had become the centers of new parishes (quoad sacra). Vor their 
maintenance the Kirk sessions made grants from their ordinary funds arising from 
church collections, from casual mortifications (i. e., gifts and legacies), and other 
sources; hence the name by which they were designated. 
XII—(a) Causes of the disruption of the church.—The union of the crowns of Eng- 
land and Scotland (1684) was followed at an interval of eight years by the union of 
  a. The act, however, could not ereate schools, nor prevent the —
-P-A-G-E-252
      O74 8 »EDUCATION REPORT, -1889-90. 
as a result of the accession, and the union with England stimulated art 
and commerce and opened new careers to the ambitious youth of Scot- 
land. ~ These circumstances, with the necessity of raising the shiftless 
and ignorant from their wretched condition, gave an impulse to educa- 
tional efforts. 
IX.—ACT FOR “ SETTLING SCHOOLS.” 
The act of 1646 afforded the required basis for action. Its provisions 
were revived in an act of 1696, for “settling schools,” and the church was 
empowered to see that the law was effectually carried out. A school in 
every parish became an accomplished fact throughout the Lowland 
districts, the presbyteries exercising their authority wherever the 
heritors failed to act in the matter. To the latter bodies also was in- 
trusted the supervision. of schools, which service imparted to them 
a unity of purposes, similarity of conduct, and equality of results sel- 
dom attained in the incipient stages of a system, and never attained by 
purely local efforts, Security of salary and tenure drew to the schools 
a body of superior teachers and imparted dignity and influence to the 
office. 
The uncertain division of responsibility between the heritors and 
presbyteries was a source of friction which soon made itself felt in the 
operations of the system. This, however, was a matter oy adjusted. 
Parliaments (1707). The second measure excited deep Gare ta in the northern 
country, particularly on account of the solicitude of the Scotch for the independence 
of their church. Indeed, the union could not have been accomplished but for an act 
expressly exempting the church from the interests to be affected. 
A few years later (1712) an act restoring lay patronage in respect to church livings 
was passed and a limited toleration act in favor of Episcopalians. In 1731 the right 
was formally given to the heritors and elders to “elect and callincumbents to chureh 
livings instead of to name and propose the person to the whole congregation, to be 
approven or disproven,” nor was the law submitted to the presbyteries for approval. 
The abuse of patronage, and more especially the ignoring of the rights of congre- 
gations, was the provoking cause of the disruption of the church. The sympathies 
of teachers were largely involved in the movement. 
(b) Educational activity of the new church.—Ia the general assembly which met in 
October, 1843, six months after the crisis, it was reported “that 80 parochial teach- 
ers, 57 teachers of assembly schools, and 27 teachers of schools connected with the 
Society for Propagating Christian Knowledge had intimated their intention of ad- 
hering to the Free Church, besides 196 teachers of privately endowed and adventure 
schools. It was also ascertained that the teachers, students, and scholars of both the 
normal schools at Edinburgh and Glasgow had, almost without exception, adhered 
to the Free Church. The assembly resolved to prosecute the education scheme with 
energy, and a plan was adopted for raising £50,000 to aid in erecting 500 school- 
houses, in order that there might be, as far as possible, a school attached to every 
ministerial charge.”—[Education Commission (Scotland), 1st Rep., p. 95.] 
Five years. later the education committee reported that the amount raised was 
£39,113 18s. 3d. The committee had erected normal schools in Glasgow and Edinburgh, 
at a total cost, including the government grants, of £19,099 16s, and they reported 
the existence of 428 congregational schools and 177 schools either subordinate or 
subsidiary to the first class, and chiefly situated in the Highlands. Besides these

A serious and, as it proved, irremediable defect in the system was the 
want of expansive force and flexibility. It could neither grow with 
inereasing demands nor adjust itself to regions differing widely in nat- 
ural and social conditions. As a system, it utterly failed in the High- 
Jands, and it had no application to the burghs. The church endeavored. 
to make up these deficiencies by supplementary agencies, and at length, 
after a century of faithful effort, invoked the aid of legislation with the 
view of fortifying the parish system and giving public support to ad- 
ditional schools. 
X.—NEW LEGISLATION. 
An act passed in 1803 defined more strictly the respective powers of 
heritors and presbyteries, improved the salaries of masters, and in- 
creased the provision of parish schools in the Highlands by authoriz- 
ing the erection of “‘side schools” at the expense of the heritors. The 
efforts in behalf of the Highlands did not stop here. Mission schools 
were created, and in 1825 the church developed a general scheme for 
dealing with these regions. The outcome of this scheme was the es- 
tablishment (1835) of an additional class of schools called Parliamentary 
schools, because the salaries of the masters were paid from a public 
grant. But parish schools, supplemented by side and Parliamentary 
and mission schools, ee not completely meet the needs of the people 
  
a thira class of 12 missionary pectbon existed in destitute localities, but most of 
them in connection with churches either ‘‘in progress or in contemplation.” Seren 
grammar schools had also been established in important towns, and 102 evening 
schools, ‘the attendance on which may be regarded as nearly all additional to the 
attendance during the day.” These schools were taught by 659 teachers, “all re- 
ceiving salaries or gratuities, more or less, upon the scheme.”—[Public Education, 
pp. 361, 362.] 
XILI—(a) Scope of parish schools.—In his testimony before a committee of the House 
of Lords in 1845, Dr. Pyper, professor of humanity in St. Andrews University, 
characterized the parish schools as follows: ‘“‘The parochial schools of Scotland per- 
form the functions of three classes of schools on the continent. In the first place, 
they are primary or elementary schools, properly so called; in the second place, they 
are burgher or commercial schools, where more extended instruction, but generally 
excluding the ancient languages, may be obtained; and, thirdly, they serve the pur- 
pose of grammar schools throughout Scotland.” 
Mr. Shuttleworth, who quotes this testimony, adds: ‘‘ Owing to this constitution, 
the Scotch parochial school has been distinguished by one beautiful feature. Upon 
its benches the children of every rank in life have met and have contended for 
honors, earned only by higher natural gifts or superior moral qualities. Those whom 
the accidents of rank and fortune have not yet separated have here formed friendships 
which have united the laird and the hind through life by mutual service and protec- 
tion. Thus sentiment has overleaped the barriers which divide society into classes, 
to acknowledge the claims of personal feeling and to lift humble merit from obscur- 
ity.”—[Public Education, p. 335.] 
(b) Curricula of burgh schools. —What the purposes of ‘‘ grammar schools” were may 
best be determined by an examination of their curricula, of which numerous prospec- 
tuses are given in the Special Report on Middle Class Schools in Scotland (1868) and 
ED 90 15

_ nor afford scope for the missionary zeal which saw in every neglected 
haunt of humanity and in every district where Catholicism held sway 
an outpost of Satan. A number of voluntary societies, inspired by 
proselyting or philanthropic zeal, entered also upon the educational 
work. 
XI.— BURGH SCHOOLS—PUBLIC AND PAROCHIAL. 
The burghs of Scotland, although not included in the operations ot 
the parish system, and having no statute provision for popular educa- 
_ tion, played an important part in the educational development. Burgh 
schools, created as we have seen by municipal authority or by private 
bounty and supported in part by the public funds of the burghs, multi- 
plied during the period under consideration. 
The growth of commercial relations created also in the larger towns, 
a demand for courses of instruction better adapted than the old classi- 
eal course to the requirements of lads who were destined for busi- 
ness. Discussions similar to those which center to-day in the com- 
parative merits of classical and modern studies were rife. In some 
burghs, side by side with the classical schools, academies were founded 
for instruction in modern languages, mathmematics, ete., to the ex- 
clusion of Latin and Greek; and in others departments were formed in 
the classical schools designed to meet the new requirements. 
The church exercised supervision over these burgh schools and 
academies, although it had no part in their foundation or support. 
They drew their pupils mostly from the middle classes, as was the case

in Grant’s History of Burgh Schools, chapter x11. From the latter is cited the fol- 
lowing ‘“ordo schole grammatice,” used at the High School of Edinburgh in 1640: 
“During the first sixmonths of the first-year the scholars shall be taught the prin- 
ciples of grammar in vernaculo sermone, learning at the same time the Latin names of 
everything on earth and in heaven; during the second six months they shall daily 
repeat a certain portion of grammar and learn particular sentences relating to life 
and manners; during the first six months of the second year they shall repeat daily 
certain parts of grammar, more particularly as laid down by Despauter, translating 
the same into English; also they shall read Cordery’s Colloquies; during the sec- 
» ond six months they shall be taught daily the syntax of Erasmus, the masters 
teaching and the scholars learning in the Latin language. Through the whole of 
the third year they shall repeat daily a portion of etymology and syntax, be exer- 
cised in reading Cicero’s de Senectute and de Amicitia, Terence’s comedies and elegies, 
Ovid’s Yristia, Buchanan’s Psalms, and Cicero’s epistles, reading the same clara voce. 
In the fourth year they shall repeat daily for the first month what they had already 
learned, be taught Buchanan’s prosody with Despauter’s select rules, and Buchanan’s 
epigrams and poetry; during the other months they shall be exercised in poetry and 
in the practice of the rules of grammar, reading Virgil, Ovid’s Metamorphosis, Hor- 
ace, Buchanan’s Psalms, translating Cicero, Cesar, and Terence; the beauties of these 
authors to beexplainedtothem. In the fifth year they shall study the whole rhetoric 
of Tully and the greater part of the compendious rhetoric of Cassander; read Cicero’s 
Orations and the short speeches in Sallust, Virgil,and Lucan; they shall read dis- 
tinetly and audibly, and declaim.”—[Grant’s History of Burgh Schools, chap. x11, 
pp. 339, 340.]

also, in the main, with the sessional schools established by the church 
in the larger towns. Mission schools, on the contrary, sought the, 
poorer. neighborhoods and ministered to the laboring classes. Private 
schools of various kinds existed, but the larger proportions were want- 
ing in all qualities of good schools. 
It is obvious that under the conditions here described there was, 
both in parishes and burghs, great waste of educational effort. Schools 
multiplied without special reference to the wants of the population, 
and without guarantees of efficiency, and with uncertain or fluctuating 
support. 
*XII.—DISRUPTION OF THE CHURCH. 
While the general conditions of the country operated thus to multi- 
ply the educational agencies, a movement took place within the church 
which was destined to destroy its supreme control of those agencies 
and eventually to work a radical change in the system of education. 
Presbyterianism being firmly established and in favor with the govern- 
ment, there naturally grew up within its fold a party more disposed 
to seek the alliance of worldly power than to consider the wishes of 
the people. This party gradually gained the ascendancy in the gen- 
eral assembly and began to shape the church policy upon aristocratic 
lines. This tendency was especially shown in the appointment of 
ministers. Under the sanction of the act of 1712, reviving lay patron- 
age, the preferences of the landed gentry were consulted rather than 
  
trate the work proposed for ‘modern schools.” Tt consists of “the higher branches 
of arithmetic; mathematical, physical, and political geography; logic, and the prin- 
ciples of composition; algebra, including the theory of equations and the differen- 
tial calculus; geometry, consisting of the first six books of Euclid; plane and spher- 
ical trigonometry; mensuration of surfaces and solids; navigation, fortification; 
analytical geometry and conic sections; natural philosophy, consisting of statics, 
dynamics, hydrostatics, pneumatics, optics, and astronomy; and subsequently chem- 
istry was added, consisting of heat, light, including spectrum analysis, chemical 
affinity, laws of combining proportion, atomic theory, nomenclature, and notation, 
the gases, acids, alkalies, etc.. The town council adopted, with some modifica- 
tions, this programme, voted a large sum of money as salaries, and appointed a 
rector and master to carry it out.”—[Burgh Schools, pp. 118, 119.] 
(c) The training of teachers. —With respect to the training of teachers, the witnesses 
examined before the select committee of the House of Lords in 1845 unite in declar- 
ing that ‘‘the parochial schoolmaster ought to be educated during two years in one of 
the universities of Scotland and produce certificates of his attainments. They 
would also require him to.attend a normal school, for the purpose of acquiring a _ 
knowledge of the principles and best methods of teaching, and for the practice of 
the art under proper superintendence in some model school. But they appear to bo 
less conscious that, for the teacher of the parochial school, not knowledge or method 
is alone required, but much pecnliar and special knowledge, and that everything 
which he knows should be molded so as to be most available for the mental train- 
ing as well as the mere instruction of young scholars. The witnesses consider it 
essential that the parochial schoolmaster should be able so to instruct his scholars 
in Latin and Greek and mathematics as to prepare them forthe college classes; that

the wishes of congregations. This course was in direct violation of a 
' principle insisted upon by the Reformers and jealously guarded by the 
people. The agitations excited by this abuse of patronage culminated 
in 1843 in a disruption of the church. “On one solemn day of assem- 
bly,” says Shuttleworth, “more than four hundred ministers separated 
themselves from the communion of the Established Church; ” the seced- 
ing congregations, which included a large proportion of the best 
elements of the population, formed the Free Kirk of Scotland. The 
new Society threw itself into the educational work with great 
ardor, created its own schools for the children of its fold, and vied 
with the established church in the maintenance of mission schools in 
the Highlands and in the growing towns. Wherever its influence was 
felt it was exercised in favor of congregationalism, which in church 
affairs is equivalent to the public will in political affairs. The inde- 
pendent stand taken by the Free Church stimulated the rivalry of 
other denominations. As a result of these activities, the single paro- 
chial school system, supplemented by schools otherwise maintained but 
subject for the most part to the supervision of the presbyteries, gave 
place to a double system, comprising on the one hand the parish schools 
controlled by the Established Church, and on the other separate 
schools in connection with other churches. The change is illustrated 
_ by the fact that whereas in 1842, out of an estimated total of 4,407 
schools in Scotland, 3,047, or 70 per cent, were examined by presby- 
teries; in 1850, out of a total of 4,371 schools reported, only 1,872, or 43 
he should also be able to teach the practical applications of mathematics to land- 
surveying, measuring, navigation, ete.; algebra, commercial arithmetic, and book- 
keeping; English grammar, French, geography, history, the rudiments of agricul- 
zural chemistry. They all insist strongly on a full and critical knowledge of the 
Holy Scriptures and of the Shorter Catechism of the Assembly of the Divines. No 
mention is made of instruction in music or in art.       
* * * * * * * 
“The schoolmasters examined before this committee urge the adoption of a fixed 
standard of qualification. It is the general practice to require certificates of schol- 
arship and success in teaching. A candidate ought to produce a certificate from the 
rector of a properly constituted normal school for the purpose of training young 
men to the practice and knowledge of teaching.”—[Public Education, pp. 336-337. ] 
(d) Notable bequests.—Among several bequests of this period the Dick bequest 
stands out with peculiar prominence, for its amount, application, and administra- 
tion. Its founder was James Dick, a successful merchant, who died in 1828. In 
1833 his bequest amounted to £113,147 4s 7d, which was afterwards increased to 
£118,787 11s. 
According to the terms of Mr. Dick’s will the income of the fund was to be applied 
to the assistance of the county parochial schoolmasters in the three counties of Aber- 
deen, Banff, and Moray, excluding the royal burghs, but in such a manner as not in 
any way to relieve the heritors or other persons from their legal obligations in re- 
spect to the support of teachers. Dr. S. 8. Laurie, who has been the visitor for the 
trustees since 1856, has given an interesting history of the operations of the fund in 
his report for 1890. 
Among other bequests which became available about the same time as the above

per cent maintained relations with the Established Church. The 
parish system had been overgrown by auxiliary and rival institutions. 
XIII.—HIGH IDEALS OF THE SCHOOLS AND REACTION UPON PUBLIC 
SPIRIT. 
While the constitution of a school system was becoming thus insensi- 
bly a matter of experimental discovery to the people, scholastic ideals 
acquired also a secure place in their thoughts. Here the influence of 
the burgh schools was paramount. They carried instruction to the 
level of the universities, or made it the preparation for business, and 
thus they familiarized the people with higher standards of popular edu- 
cation than can be realized by purely elementary schools. The parish 
schools, preserving the traditions of their origin and following the lead 
of the burgh schools, added classical and academic courses to the ele- 
mentary branches and kept a clear road open to the universities, There 
were, of course, great differences in their practical work; housing and 
equipment might be miserable and the teacher incompetent in one par- 
ish; in the next the teacher efficient, ably sustained, and capable of 
inspiring pupils with enthusiasm for knowledge. But with all these 
differences there was one uniform theory of education. Probably no 
system of elementary schools ever showed a higher proportion of uni- 
versity graduates among the teachers than the Scottish schools at this 
period. For this reason it is the more remarkable that the need of 
professional training for teachers should also have been recognized, 
was one of £90,000, made by John McNabbe, for the benefit of the poor of the parish. 
of Dollar and shire of Clackmannan, and one of £20,000 made by Mz. Milne to en- 
dow a school in Fochabers. 
XIV.—The education committee of the general assembly reported, in 1829, that a 
considerable portion of those attending at the several schools are of the Roman Cath- 
olic Church; and it is proper to state that the schools are always open to scholars of 
this class as freely and on the same terms as to the Protestants, and that the teachers 
have been directed not to press on the Roman Catholic children any instruction to 
which their parents or their priests may object, as interfering with the principles 
of their own religion. The Roman Catholics resort, accordingly, to the general- 
assembly schools, in most cases, without jealousy or reluctance, and receive every 
branch of literary instruction in the same classes with the Protestants, from the same 
schoolbooks, and without any sort of distinction betwixt the denominations. At the 
same time the committee have specially directed that the instruction given at the 
assembly schools, whatever may be the number of the Catholics usually in attend- 
ance, shall be accommodated strictly and exclusively to the principles of the Estab- 
lished Church, and the Catholic children are invited to participate, so far as their 
advisers may think proper to direct them.—[Public Education, pp. 357, 358.] 
The committee of the Free Church declare ‘‘ we do not plant our schools as nurs- 
eries of Free Catechism, nor do we ask our teachers to make proselytes to Free 
Churchism of their pupils. Our schools are really as simple and purely elementary 
schools for giving a good general education to the young as were the best parish 
schools before the disruption. Our teachers, like other teachers, teach the Bible and 
the Shorter. Catechism along with the common branches. of school instruction. The 
only peculiarity is that Free Church parents may send their children to our schools 
 
-P-A-G-E-258
        230 = EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
The Established Church began this work in 1841, creating a normal 
school in Edinburgh and a second in Glasgow; in 1845 the Free Church 
followed the precedent in both cities. 
Educational bequests testified to the enlightened regard for public 
interests which the general diffusion of knowledge naturally creates. 
These were for the most part applied to the fostering of secondary 
education, or to bringing the chances of university training within the 
reach of poor lads, 
XIV.—RELIGIOUS TOLERANCE. 
The spirit of religious tolerance displayed in the conduct of clerical 
schools contrasts strangely with the prevailing intolerance of religious 
sects. In the schools, alike of the Established and of the Free Church, 
all sectarian tests for the children of noncommunicants were forbidden. 
This policy was, however, the natural consequence of the intense desire 
of each church to extend its influence, coupled with an earnest belief in 
the moral effects of education. The purpose of the Established Church 
-to keep control of the educational work was further indicated in its 
_ opposition to private schools. In this it was heartily seconded by the 
burghal authorities. 
XV.—INFLUENCE OF UNIVERSITIES, 
The relations between the universities and elementary schools were 
- maintained by the easy passage from the lower to the higher curriculum, by 
_ the general distribution of university-trained teachers, and by the system 
of bursaries. The importance of the universities was recognized by the 
appointment of royal commissioners to investigate and report upon their 
  
without any fear of their being drawn away from the Church; and others, to whom 
the guaranty of a Christian church seems of no value may send their children 
without any fear of their being drawn away from Christianity.”—[Public Education, 
pp. 364, 365.] 
XV.—(a) University bursaries.—In 1830 Aberdeen controlled bursary funds yield- 
ing an annual income of £2,871, and providing tuition for 240 students; Edinburgh 
had 80 bursaries, supported by funds yielding annually £1,172; Glasgow 72, supported 
by an annual income from bursaries of £1,287; St. Andrews 55, on an annual income 
of £580.—[General report of the commissioners (1831) pp. 316, 349, 113, 236, 394.] 
(b) By the act of 1858 the two universities of Aberdeen, i. ¢., King’s College and 
Marischal College, were united into one university and college. Theact “introduced 
important changes in the constitution and government of all the universities. The 
ordinary administration of the affairs of each remained vested, as practically it had 
previously been, in all except Edinburgh, in the hands of the senatus academicus, 
or body consisting af principals and professors. 
“The act invested the senate of Edinburgh University with like functions, theso 
having previously been exercised in that university by the magistrates and coun- 
cils of the city. 
* * * * * * * 
“While the ordinary government of each of the universities was vested under tho 
statute in the senatus academicus, the acts of the senatus were made subject to the
-P-A-G-E-259

status. Three such inquiries were ordered during this period, viz, in 
1826, 1830, and 1837, respectively. They were directed specially to the 
organization of the universities, but the scheme and conduct of studies 
were also considered. The outcome of these inquiries was the univer- 
sities (Scotland) act, 1858. It was during this period, also, that the 
passion for speculative philosophy developed in the Scotch universities, 
particularly at Glasgowand Edinburgh. While this movement possibly 
lessened the influence of the universities in the practical affairs of the 
country, it gave to Scotland a distinctive part in the intellectual prog- 
ress of modern Europe. 
XVI.—RESULTS AND FAILURE OF THE PARISH SYSTEM. 
As to the results of instruction so zealously fostered at this period 
there is much evidence. Macaulay paid an eloquent tribute to the act, 
which gave the impulse to the work, ina speech delivered in the House 
of Commons in 1847, and it has been the common theme of historians of 
the period. It is obvious, however, that the ideal of a national system 
which the Reformers had in view when, in 1560, they framed the First 
Book of Discipline, had not yet been realized. The failure, apparently, 
was due to the want of some central organization that should embrace 
and unite all the agencies at work. The constitution of the burgh 
schools kept alive the notion of civil authority in the school affairs. 
The democratic spirit of the adherents of the Free Church tended in 
the same direction; gradually, new conceptions of an educational system, 
developed and began to focus themselves around the Government, 
which had assumed an active part in the promotion of elementary in- 
struction. 
  
control and review of the university court, a new governing body introduced by 
the act.”—[Report of the Scottish Universities Commission (1878) pp. 2, 3.] 
XVI.—LEffects of the act of 1696.—‘‘ What followed? An improvement such as the _ 
world had never seen took place in the moral and intellectual character of the peo- 
ple Soon, in spite of the rigor of the climate, in spite of the sterility of the earth, 
Scotland became a country which had no reason to envy the fairest portions of the 
globe. Wherever the Scotchman went, and there were few parts of the world to 
which he did not go, he carried his superiority with him. If he was admitted into 
a public office, he worked his way up to the highest post; if he got employment in 
a brewery or a factory, he was soon the foreman; if he took a shop, his trade was 
the best in the street; if he enlisted in the army, he became a color sergeant; if he 
went to a colony, he was the most thriving planter there. The Scotchman of the 
seventeenth century had been spoken of in London as we speak of the Esquimaux, 
The Scotchman‘of the eighteenth century was an object, not of scorn but of envy. 
The cry was that wherever he came he got more than his share; that, mixed with 
Englishmen or mixed with Irishmen, he rose to the top as surely as oil rises to the 
top of water. And what had produced this great revolution? The Scotch air was 
still as cold, the Scotch rocks were still as bare as ever. All the natural qualities of - 
the Scotchman were still what they had been when learned and benevolent men ad- 
vised that he should be flogged like a beast of burden to his daily task. But the 
state had given him an education. That education was not, it is true, in all respects 
what it should have been. But such as it was it had done more for the bleak and

  232 EDUCATION. REPORT, 1889-90, 
FourTH PERIOD, 1847-1872. 
XVII.—GOVERNMENT ACTION. 
Spirit manifested towards.—The fourth of the periods under re- 
view is marked by the new attitude assumed by the general Govern- 
ment with respect to educational work. Heretofore, the action of the 
Government had been confined to a small annual grant in aid of 
schools, accompanied with a slight measure of direction and supervi- 
sion. In 1847, in consideration of a great increase in the grant (i. ¢., 
from £30,000 to £100,000) the directive and supervisory functions of 
the Government were also greatly extended. The effect in Scotland 
for a time was to increase rather than to diminish the divergence of 
educational agents. 
By, reason of its previous history, however, Scotland was peculiarly 
well prepared to codperate with the general Government in the conduct 
of education, hence the contentions which had raged in England over 
the creation of the education department (1839), and which were re- 
_ newed in 1846-47 over the increased scope of its operations, did not 
extend to the northern kingdom. The chief cause of these contentions, 
_ namely, the threatened supremacy of the church, no longer existed 
here, as the Scotch Church already shared its authority over schools 
with the civil powers. The problem of religious instruction had also 
reached a peaceful solution in Scotland. The “Shorter Catechism” 
  
dreary shores of the Forth and the Clyde than the richest of soils and the most 
genialof climates had done for Capua and Tarentum.”—[Macaulay’s speeches and 
poems, Vol. 11, pp. 60-61. See also Lecky’s History of England in the Eighteenth Cen- 
tury, Vol. 11, pp. 45, 48, 49.] 
XVII.—(a@) Government grants and developing policy.—In 1833 a grant of £20,000 
($100,000) was made by Parliament in aid of education in Great Britain. It was 
applied solely to building purposes, and was distributed through private societies. 
The grant was renewed annually, and in 1847 increased to £100,000 ($500,000). Scot- 
land does not appear to have availed itself of the bounty at first. In 1839 the edu- 
cation department (committee of council on education) was created and charged with 
the distribution of the fund. 
In view of the proposed increase in the appropriation, the department issued min- 
utes (1846-47) providing for increased inspection of aided schools, more definite 
guaranties of efficiency in the teaching body, improved status of pupil-teachers 
(apprentices in elementary schools), higher rates of compensation to masters for 
making the schools more attractive and of greater practical advantages to the poor. 
Opposition in England was excited particularly by minutes of the same year pro- 
viding for the representation of lay subscribers in the management of Church of 
England schools. This was stoutly opposed as an infringement upon the prerogative 
of the Church.—[Minutes of Committee of Council on Education, 1846.] 
July 10, 1847, directly after the grant of £100,000 had been allowed, the depart- 
ment issued a general letter of instruction to the Government inspectors defining 
their duties under the new conditions, and giving in detail the requirements which 
managers must fulfill in order to secure the benefits of the grant for their schools. 
‘These requirements pertained to school buildings, houses for the teachers, qualifica- 
tions of pupil-teachers who might be employed, and the income which must be 
assured to certificated teachers, in whose behalf alone augmentation of stipend might

was a manual acceptable to all Presbyterians, and no attempt was 
made in the schools to force it upon others. Under these circumstances, 
all that Scotland demanded was the preservation of the existing status 
of the delicate question, a demand which fully accorded with the dis- 
position of the Government. 
Effects of —The new policy went into operation in Scotland in 1848, 
Its stimulating effects were quickly realized. In thirteen years the 
enrollment of pupils increased from a ratio of 1 in 13 of the population 
to 1 in every 6.5. ° 
Inspected schools, with their trained teachers, showed a higher 
average of results than the uninspected, and the income of inspected 
schools was substantially increased. Tor example, in 1848 the average 
annual income of 1,049 parochial schools, omitting the value of build- 
ings, was about £57, In 1864 the average annual income of inspected 
schools was £103 17s 7d, of which £33 9s 2d were derived from the 
parliamentary grants. 
But for the fact that the spirit of the Scotch system was radically 
different from that of the Government or privy council system, as it 
was called, there would have been little cause for dissatisfaction. 
Theoretically at least, no distinction had been made in Scotland between 
the education of the poor and the rich. Elementary education was: 
treated as an integral part of complete education and a means of . 
equalizing the different classes of society; the Government, on the con- 
  
bo claimed for the teacher and a salary double the increase sought. Thus, as a con- 
dition of the payment by the committee of council of an augmentation of salary 
amounting to £15, the managers must provide the teacher with a salary of £30, and 
their lordships required that at least £15 of this salary should be derived from sub- 
scriptions, donations, or collections, either local or from a general subscription fund. 
Further, it was ordered that at least one-half of the local salary should be derived 
from some other source than school pence.—[Minutes of 1847,] 
(b) Estimates based upon the reports of the education committees of the churches 
give a total of 225,000 pupils for Scotland in 1848. This was very nearly 8 per cent 
of the population according to the census of 1851 (i. e., 2,870,784).—[Public Educa- 
tion, pp 370, 371.] 
The estimates of income (1848) are from the same source (p. 369). 
The statistics for 1861 are to be found in the second report of the Education Com- 
mission, p. xix, and appendix; summarized tables, pp. 1-3; also Special Statistical 
Report of the Commission, pp. 1-38.

trary, sought only to aid in giving the poorer classes the rudiments of 
knowledge. The impossibility of harmonizing these two ideals helped 
to keep alive and to increase the demand for a reorganization of the 
entire work. 
_ XVII.—LEGISLATION OF 1861. 
The year 1861 marks a distinct step forward in the passage from an 
ecclesiastical to a civil school system. In that year an act was passed 
which transferred the examination of schoolmasters from the presby- 
teries to boards of examiners appointed by the courts of the four uni- 
versities. For the religious test heretofore required the new act sub- 
stituted a general declaration by the teacher-elect to the intent that he 
would not teach or inculcate any opinions opposed in the Shorter Cate- 
chism and that he would do nothing prejudicial to the interests of the 
Established Church. The act provided specifically for the discipline 
of masters and for their dismissal from the service. It raised the 
minimum annual salary to £35 and the maximum to £70, and provided 
for retiring pensions. 
The election of masters remained in the hands of the heritors and 
minister of the parish, and the superintendence of schools in the charge 
of the presbyteries. 
It should be specially noted that the act empowered the heritors to 
“establish a female teacher,” and in such case a yearly salary of £30 
might be added to the school assessment, but in no case was the edu- 
cational assessment to exceed £110. 
XIX.—ROYAL COMMISSION TO INQUIRE INTO THE SCOTCH SYSTEM, 
In 1864 a commission was appointed to examine into the operations 
of the Scotch system, The inquiry was exhaustive, covering the actual 
state of education and the views of representative men as to the meas- 
ures by which. a national, permanent, and efficient system could be 
secured. The time was fully ripe for such a measure; the current of 
thought and discussion set irresistibly toward that consummation. 
. The years that intervened between the publication of the report of 
the commission and the passage of the Scotch education act were oc- 
eupied in the elaboration of a plan which should conserve and unify 
the forces already enlisted, supply the expansive power. which had 
been wanting in the parish system, and above all carry the popular 
sympathies, as that system had done in the Lowlands,

the stigma of indifference to the intellectual degradation of the people, 
The agitation of the subject in England began with the nineteenth 
century, and from its beginning the parochial-school law of Scotland 
was cited as an example and a reproach to England. Before all the 
committees and commissions appointed to inquire into the existing 
state of popular education in England, from Lord Brougham’s select 
committee of 1818 to the Duke of Newcastle’s commission, 1858, the 
system which had taken root in Scotland was the subject of close in- 
quiry. Its indigenous origin, its priority in time over other systems of 
Europe, its vital force, its scholarly spirit, and its inherent limitations 
became matters of familiar and suggestive knowledge to those who 
were working for the development of a system in England. ‘ 
Lord Brougham went so far as to advocate the parish system, which 
had worked so well in Scotland, for the country districts of England. 
The fourth and last of the historic periods here reviewed completes 
the series of events leading naturally to an organized system of popu- 
lar education adapted to the spirit of the Scotch people and to the 3 
conditions of modern society. To the final result each of the periods - 
considered made a distinctive contribution which succeeding periods 
conserved and expanded. From the first were derived institutions, 
policies of control, and the sense of civic obligation; from the second, 
the essential principles, the framework and informing purposes of an 
educational system; from the third, a century and a half of practical 
experience in the conduct of a tentative system; from the fourth, the 
agency for consolidating and harmonizing forces that hitherto worked 
without organic union. The present system is not a modern creation, 
butis deeply rooted in the national history; herein is the cause at once 
of its stability and its progressive spirit.

  STRUCTURE OF THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM OF ENGLAND AND Op- ; 
ERATIONS FOR 1889-90. : 
The Report of the Commissioner of Education for 1888-89 contained 
a detailed account of the educational system of England. The main é 
features of the system are here repeated, with statistics of a later date. 
This country affords a striking example of the union of public and pri-- 
vate, national and local agencies in a system of public elementary educa- : 
tion. The education of the upper and the upper middle classes is pro- ; 
vided for in schools, colleges, and universities, which are entirely distinct 
from the elementary system. These have little or no support from pub- 
lic funds and are not under public supervision. The distinction of social 
classes is so positive that, in determining the amount of elementary school 
accommodation to be provided, a deduction of one-seventh of the total 
of children 1 to 13 years inclusive is made for the children of the mid- 
dle and upper classes who are not to be included in the provision.?

  238 EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90, 
According to the Statesman’s Yearbook for 1892, the universities and 
colleges of England and Wales had an attendance of 13,903 students, 
exclusive of 1,755 evening students and 3,559 students in technical 
classes, and employed a force of 812 professors. There were also 
four university colleges for women with 342 students. The budget for 
1889-90 includes £15,000 ($75,000) for provincial colleges. The same 
authority states that no complete trustworthy statistics of middle- 
class or secondary education are available. In addition to the provision 
for general education, there are many agencies for technical education. 
These operate chiefly in the metropolis and the great manufacturing 
centers. 
ELEMENTARY SYSTEM. 
Central control.—The organization of the system of elementary edu- 
cation dates from the passage of the education act of 1870.1 The Gov- 
ernment, which had been fostering education by grants since 1833, at 
that time assumed the responsibility of insuring the efficient elemen- 
tary instruction of all children. The committee of council on educa- 
tion, which had been created in 1839, became the central agency 
through which the Government was to effect its purpose. This com- 
mittee, termed also the education department, consists of lords of the 
privy council. The lord president of the council is the head of the 
_ education department, assisted by a member of the council who is 
  called the vice-president of the committee on education. The pres- 
ent head of the department is Viscount Cranbrook; the vice-president 
is Sir W. Hart Dyke. As these officials change with the change of polit- 
ical parties, the secretary becomes the chief permanent official in the 
department. The present incumbent of this position is Mr. G. W. 
Kekewich. 
The central department is empowered to require returns as to 
school accommodations in any and all school districts; to order the 
election of school boards; to form school boards upon the failure of 
ratepayers to elect; sanction loans to school boards for the construc- 
_ tion of school buildings; approve by-laws as to compulsory attendance, 
and scale of fees in board schools; receive the reports of Her Majesty’s 
inspectors, and distribute the annual grant. The department prepares 
an annual code (i. ¢., manual of rules and regulations) determining 
the conditions for participating in the grant, which is submitted to 
Parliament for approval, presents an annual report upon the opera- 
tions of the system, and makes the annual estimates of appropriations 
required for the work. 
For the purposes of the Government inspection the country is divided 
into ten divisions, each under a chief inspector; under these there are 
  
1Subsequent acts have modified and extended the act of 1870; the chief of these 
are the acts of 1873, 1876, 1879, 1880, 1891.
-P-A-G-E-267
  107 inspectors, 45 sub-inspectors, and 152 assistants. There are also 
two chief inspectors for training colleges. 1 
The annual inspection and examination of the schools conducted by 
these officials pertain exclusively to the conditions upon which the 
grant is given. These relate to the buildings, teaching staff, duration 
of the school year, and a specific amount of scholastic work, including 
only secular branches. 
Local control. Beyond the two responsibilities assumed by Govern- 
ment—i, e., securing the efficient instruction of all children in the ele- 
ments of knowledge and an economic expenditure of the Government 
grant—the largest liberty is left to local authorities. These authorities 
are of two kinds, school boards and the managers of private (i. ¢., vol- 
untary) schools. The boards are elected by the ratepayers of school 
districts for a period of three years. Within the limits imposed by the 
education acts their authority is absolute, They may claim and levy 
rates (2. e. local taxes) for the support of elementary schools, make com- 
pulsory by-laws, and raise loans for building purposes (subject to the 
approval of the department), engage teachers, fix the rates of salary, 
and determine the general conduct of the schools in their respective 
districts. 
As constituted by the act of 1870, the school districts are the metrop- 
olis, every borough, and every parish (i. ¢., place in which a separate 
poor rate is or may be made) not included in the foregoing. 
In 1890 there were in England and Wales 2,287 school boards com- 
prising a population of 15,500,279, or 57 per cent of the total population 
(census 1891), The populations under the respective boards vary 
greatly; of the whole number 5 per cent have less than 250 inhabitants; 
18.2 per cent, between 250 and 500; 44 per cent, between 500 and 2,000; 
16.6 per cent, between 2,000 and 5,000; 16.2 per cent, above 5,000. 
The additional population under school-attendance committees in 
districts not having school boards was 9,394,160, which with the popu- 
lation under school boards makes up 89 per cent of the total popula- 
tion. : 
‘The managers of voluntary schools (which are mostly parochial) have 
the same liberty as the boards. . In respect to religious instruction both 
classes of local authorities are bound by the ‘“‘conscience clause”? of 
the education act, which forbids any religious test to be applied to 
children and allows any child to be withdrawn from religious exercise | 
whose parents or guardians so desire. Board schools moreover are 
strictly prohibited from giving instruction in any religious catechism 
or religious formulary which is distinctive of any particular denomi- 
nation. * 
Public elementary schools.—According to the nature of their local con- 
trol public elementary schools, i. ¢., schools recognized as efficient by the

« As compared with the previous year, there is an increase of 98,844 (or 
1.82 per cent) in school places, 48,314 (or 1.02 per cent) in enrollment, 
sand of 35,292 (0.96 per cent) in average attendance. The estimated in- 
erease of population during the year is 1.35 per cent. The total en- 
rollment (viz, 4,825,560) is equivalent to 16.6 per cent of the total popu- 
lation. There were, in addition, 43,347 pupils in average attendance 
upon night schools. 
Sources of support.—The public funds for the maintenance of these 
schools are local taxes (rates), which can be applied to board schools 
only, and the Government grant. The private funds consist of school 
fees, endowments, subscriptions, and benefactions. The following tables 
show the financial status of the schools for the year 1889-90:

a@As this matter goes to press, information is received of the passage of the act of 1891. Under this 
act/a sufficient sum of money will be annually appropriated to enable managers to remit the tuition 
fees (school pence) for-all children over 3 and under 15 years of age, provided the average rate of fees 
is not above 10s. per unit of average attendance. When the average rate exceeds 10s. schools having 
the benefit of the new grant may still charge a fee equal to the excess of the fee above the rate of the 
grant. This act goes into effect September 1, 1891.

All the sources of income show some increase over the preceding 
year, the total increase being 6.19 per cent. The increase in the cur- 
rent expenditure is only 3.58 per cent. Of the total expenditure 72.19 
per cent was for salaries, 11.44 per cent for books and apparatus, and 
16.37 miscellaneous. It was equivalent to $1.30 per capita of popula- 
tion, $7.84 of enrollment, and $10.13 of average attendance, 
TEACHERS. 
Classification, qualifications, and nuwmber.—Teachers of elementary 
schools are classified as (a) candidates on probation; (b) pupil teachers; 
(c) assistant teachers; (d) provisionally certificated teachers; (e) cer- 
tifieated teachers who are either trained or untrained; (f) additional 
female teachers approved by the inspector; (g) evening-school teachers. 
Candidates for a certificate must be students in a training college or 
must have been engaged two years as provisionally certificated teach- 
ers, and not under 19 years of age. They must pass two examinations 
at the interval of a year. This time must be spentina training college 
or in the work of teaching. 
Lay persons alone are recognized as teachers in day schools. 
The number of teachers employed in 1889 was 97,933, of whom 47.5 
per cent were certificated, 22 per cent were assistant teachers, and the 
. remainder, 30.5 per cent, pupil teachers. 
The increase in the number of women employed as teachers is notice- 
able. They formed about 70 per cent of the total above given. Con- 
sidering the several classes for every 100 teachers of each class, 60 cer- 
tificated teachers, 76 assistant teachers, and 75 pupil teachers were 
women; the corresponding proportion for 1869 being 48, 60, and 57. 
Appointment, tenure of office, salaries, and pensions.—Local managers 
engage teachers, fix their salaries, and determine their tenure of office. 
Salaries vary greatly, position and location both affecting the item. 
In 1890 the average salary for certificated masters was £119 18s, 
($599.50), an increase of 27 per cent since 1870; for certificated mis- 
tresses the average was £76 7s. ($381.75), an increase of 31.8 per cent. 
Residences were provided for about one-fourth of the certificated 
teachers.

  242 = BDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90, 
A small sum is annually voted by Parliament for pensions, donations, 
or special gratuities to teachers. The number of new pensions awarded 
in 1889-90 was 103, representing $12,850, besides 10 gratuities, amount- 
ing to $17,200. The total number of pensions now in force is 753, 
representing the sum of $88,050. Teachers appointed since May 9, 
1862, do not share in this bounty. The desirability of a general pen- 
sion provision is widely recognized, and a bill to that effect has been 
introduced into the House and was strongly supported. 
‘Training of —Training colleges for teachers, under Government in- 
spection and sharing in the Government grant, are of two classes—resi- 
dential or boarding, and day colleges. Of the former there are 44, all 
of which are private (voluntary) schools, and, with a single exception, 
denominational. About 69 per cent of the masters and 40 per cent of 
the mistresses of the elementary schools are graduates from these insti- 
tutions. a 
The day colleges, which were first recognized by the regulations of 
1890, must be attached to a university college or a college of equal rank, 
Oxford and Cambridge are already making provision in accordance 
- with the measure. 
Course of study for training colleges—Until the establishment of day 
training colleges, the course of study for teachers in training was de- 
termined by the syllabus of the Government examination for certificates. 
This syllabus comprises reading, recitation of assigned selections from     
English literature, penmanship, scheol management, English grammar, ~ 
composition and rhetoric, geography, English history, arithmetic, al- 
gebra and mensuration, geometry, political economy for men, domestic 
economy and sewing for women; vocal music and drawing candidates 
may also be examined in one or two of the following languages: Latin, 
Greek, French, German, and in branches of sciences prescribed in the 
syllabus of the science and art department. 
Slight differences are made between the examinations for men and 
those for women. For the latter, mathematics is limited to arithmetic, 
and but one foreign language is expected, while history is more ex- 
tended than for men. The course of study is arranged for two years, 
‘each leading to an examination conducted by the Government inspector. 
The managers of day training colleges are allowed to draw up 
their own curriculum, subject only to the approval of the department, 
and students passing successfully any examination for university de. 
grees are to be excused from further examination in the same subjects. 
This virtually enables the students of day colleges to secure teachers’ 
certificates upon the results of examinations set by their own profes- 
sors. The managers of the residential colleges were naturally dissatis- 
fied with this discrimination, and their representatives have secured sim- 
ilar privileges for their own students. 
The movement to bring university influences to bear upon the train- 
ing of teachers will, it is thought, accelerate the passage of a registra-   
 
-P-A-G-E-271
, 
EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM OF ENGLAND. 243 
tion act applicable to all classes of teachers. As professional life is 
regulated in England, this is an important step toward the elevation 
of teaching to the professional rank. By the contracts apprenticing 
- pupil-teachers, the head teachers under whom they serve are responsi- 
ble both for their instruction and professional training, and may claim 
grants for the same. The school boards of the chief cities have estab- 
lished central classes for this special work. Under recent regulations 
the strain upon the pupil-teachers is greatly relieved, the contracts 
stipulating for a certain portion of time free from the labor of teaching 
to be devoted to self-improvement. 
Statistics of training colleges.—In 1889-90, the 44 residential colleges 
were attended by 3,310 students (1,416 men, 1,894 women), and em- - : 
ployed 357 officers and teachers, exclusive of the teachers in the prac- 
ticing schools. The year’s expenditure amounted to $867,438, of which 
the Government furnished 58 per cent. 
= ORGANIZATION AND CONDUCT OF SCHOOLS. 
As a consequence of the freedom enjoyed by local managers, the . 
schools vary greatly in organization and conduct. 
These differences are very clearly shown in the annual reports of the 
Government inspectors. The conditions laid down by the department, 
_ however, for participation in the grant impose a minimum standard in 
respect to many important features. The schools recognized for grants 
are infant schools, 4. ¢., for pupils 3 to 7, day schools for older scholars 
(7 to 14), which may include, also, infant classes, evening schools for 
pupils 14 to 21 (persons under 14, exempted from the legal obligation to 
attend day schools, may be admitted). 
In 1889-90, of the whole number of pupils enrolled in day schools 
33.8 per cent were in infant schools and classes. Of these a little more — 
than half were in schools under certificated teachers of their own. 
The organization of schools for pupils 7 to 14, enrolling two-thirds of 
the pupils, is determined very largely by the scheme of study issued by 
the department. This comprises obligatory and optional branches. 
The former, which consist simply of reading, writing, and arithmetic, 
are arranged in seven grades (standards), each supposed to represent a 
year’s work. The regulations (code) for 1890 allow much freedom of 
classification, so that a pupil may be in one standard in one subject 
and in a second standard in another, provided, always, that he shall 
not be advanced a standard in any subject until he has passed examina- 
tion in that subject in the lower standard. 
The optional subjects are divided into class and specific; the former 
include grammar, geography, elementary science, and history, of which 
subjects no more than two can be taken by the same class at one time. 
The specific subjects comprise what would be considered in this coun- 
      
    Ss 
 
-P-A-G-E-272
      244° EDUCATION REPORT, 1899- 90. 
try high-school bpisohes and can only és taken by pupils who have . 
passed standard Iv. No pupil being allowed to pursue more than two 
such subjects at one time. 
The scheme of study affects the grading of the schools, the teaching 
staff, both in respect to numbers and quality, and the material equip- 
ment. 
In infant schools and classes the grant is now allowed wholly on the 
basis of average attendance. Under the regulations for 1890, collective 
examination has also been substituted for individual examination in 
obligatory subjects in schools for older children. This change, like 
the freedom of classification, favors more rational methods of instruc- 
tion, and removes the chief inducement to cram. 
Work of the schools as shown by the examinations of 1889-90.—The official report 
shows that in 1889-90 the number of children presented in schools above the infant 
grade for the Government examination was 2,596,100, or 82 per cent of their en- 
rollment. Of these, 1,409,572 being over 10 years of age ought to have been pre- 
sented in standards 1y-vi1, but only 969,441 were so presented, while 440,131 (or 
31 per cent) of the number above 10 years of age were presented in standards 
suited for children of 7, 8, and 9 years of age. 
There has been, however, a gradual improvement in this respect, which is due 
partly to the more regular attendance and increased proficiency of the children be- 
tween 5 and 10 years of age, partly to the greater attention paid by teachers to the 
progress of individual scholars. 
Class subjects.—The grant for class subjects was claimed by 20,304 (90.18 per cent) 
schools for older scholars, and allowed in 19,691 schools on account of an average 
attendance of 2,492,918. ‘In 2,212 schools (9.82 per cent), with an average at- 
tendance of 100,836, no class subject was taken. That these schools are generally 
the smallest is shown by the average ‘number for payment’ in each of them, viz, 
46, while the same average for each school in which the grant was paid was 127, and 
in which it was refused, 64.” 
* * * * * * * 
“The wider range of class subjects allowed recently under the head of ‘ele- 
mentary science’ does not appear to be taken advantage of to any great extent at 
present. The returns show but 32 schools which have taken subjects under this 
head, while geography has been taken in 12,367 schools, needlework by the girls in 
7,758, and history in 414.” 
Specific subjects.—The number of scholars presented under this head*was 78,611, 
or 15.88 per cent of the number eligible. Of these, 28,712 were from the London 
school-board district. Of the number presented, 46,871 passed in one subject and 
12,012 in two (72.08 per cent of the presentations). Algebra appears to be the favorite 
subject, claiming 37 per cent of all the passes; 25 per cent were in animal physiology 
and 28 per cent in domestic economy. The additional subjects for which special 
grants are allowed are drawing, and for girls, cookery, The grant for the latter 
was earned by 66,820 girls, an increase of 16 per cent over the previous year. 
In addition to the indirect effect of the required curriculum upon the 
equipment of schools, the department calls in every case for suitable 
buildings, well lighted, heated, drained, and ventilated, and fixes a 
minimum for the teaching staff. The principal teacher must be cer-

tificated (if the average attendance is not over 60 a provisionally cer- 
tificated teacher is allowed). When the average attendance exceeds 
60 an additional teacher must be employed. The department con- 
siders each additional certificated teacher to be sufficient for an aver- 
age attendance of 70, each assistant teacher for an average attendance 
of 50, each pupil-teacher for an average attendance of 30, each candi- 
date for a pupil-teachership on probation for an average attendance 
of 20. 
School attendance.—Every day school sharing in the grant must meet 
at least 400 times during the year, and the registers must be marked 
at every meeting (i. e., half-day session). Presence for an hour and a 
half without break constitutes an attendance in infant classes, and for 
half-timers in day schools for older scholars, Full attendance in the 
latter includes two consecutive hours, The average attendance is found 
by dividing the total number of attendances during the period con- 
sidered by the number of times the school has met during the period. 
Asa rule, no attendance is recognized in a day school for any child 
under 3 years of age, nor for anyone who has passed in the obligatory 
subjects, standard vir, and is upward of 14 years of age. Under the 
regulations of 1890 all grants to day schools,' excepting those for spe- 
cific subjects, for cookery, laundry work, and pupil-teachers, and special 
grants to rural schools, are made at fixed rates per capita of this aver- 
age attendance. 
This allotment of the grant on the basis of average attendance was 
not only intended to give greater freedom to the scholastic work, but 
to stimulate efforts for improving attendance. An act passed in 1880, 
requiring that by-laws should be made with respect to compulsory 
attendance, was directed to the same purpose, and has had a good 
effect upon the attendance of children between 5 and 10 years of age. 
Two conditions operate against a high rate of school attendance, 
namely, the reluctance of magistrates to convict parents under the 
1 The details of the allotment of the grant are the same under the code issued for 
1891 as under that for 1890, particulars of which were given in the Commissioner’s 
Report for 1888-89, pp. 101-113. 
Prior to 1890 the grant comprised four divisions in ‘schools for older scholars,” 
as follows: s 
(1) A fixed grant of 48. to 6s. per pupil. 
(2) A merit grant varying from 1s. to 3s. per pupil, according to the inspector’s 
report. 
(3) A grant for the three elementary subjects of instruction, according to the 
number of pupils passing a satisfactory examination in each. 
(4) Various grants in class and specific subjects. 
The code of 1890 raised No. 1 from 4s.-6s. to 12}s,-14s., made No. 2 a definite 
grant of 1s. to 148. for good discipline and organization, and abolished No. 3. Omitting 
all special grants, the summary shows ‘‘for-infant schools a fixed minimum grant of 
9s, and a possible maximum grant of 17s. per capita of average attendance; for schools 
for older scholars a fixed minimum grant of 13s. 6d.,and a possible maximum grant 
of 17s. per capita of average attendance.”

compulsory laws, and the low standard allowed for exemption. By the 
code of 1876 the department made the standard for exemption the 
fourth, which ought to be passed at 10 years of age,' and actually is 
passed by two-thirds of the children at that age or earlier. About 
one-third of this number disappear at once from the schools, while only 
about one in eight reaches the seventh or highest standard. School 
boards may enact by-laws fixing a higher, or, with the sanction of the 
department, a lower standard of exemption than that named. - Re- 
- eent statistics give the following information respecting the action 
_ taken in this important matter: 
Number of local authorities which have made the fourth the standard of exemp- 
tion, 9,372, representing about 32 per cent of the population;? 68 localities have no 
Dy-laws on the subject; 7 employ no compulsion after the third standard; city 
boards, as a rule, make the fifth or sixth the standard of exemption. 
With an average attendance of only 77 per cent of enrollment, the 
problem is not regarded as settled. A special cause of anxiety is 
found in the fact that the irregular attendance is confined to a certain 
class, and with them is chronic. 
' . The remedies proposed by the progressive schoolmen are a system of 
board schools for the entire county and a uniform eompulsory law. All 
parties are agreed as to the necessity of making school life interesting 
to the pupils and fruitful of such results as parents can appreciate. 
the sixth standard and 12 years of age for exemption (p.101). This, as was subse- 
quently discovered, was a mistake. 
*To pass the fourth standard the pupil must be able to read a passage from aread- 
_ ing-book or history of England; to write eight lines of poetry or prose, slowly 
read once and then dictated, and show copybook; to work examples—compound 
-money and. reduction of common weights and measures. Besides this obligatory 
work he will learn more or less of one or two class subjects. Under the education 
act of 1876 it is unlawful to employ a child who is less than 10 years of age, or 
who, being 10 years of age and upward, has not obtained the required certificate 
of exemption. > 
Under the factory act a child can not work fall time before he is 13 years of age; 
under the mines act 12 years is the age for full-time work. 
“The Prevention of Cruelty to and Protection of Children Act,” which received 
the royal assent on the 26th of August, 1889, imposed further restrictions on the 
employment of children between a certain hour at night and a certain hour in the 
morning. It, moreover, enacted that in the ease of any entertainment or series of 
entertainments to take place in licensed premises, or in any circus or other place of 
public amusement where it is shown to the satisfaction of a petty sessional court 
“that proper provision‘has been made to secure the health and kind treatment of 
-any children proposed to be employed,” the court is authorized to grant a license 
for the employment of a child over 7 years of age for such time and during such 
hours of the day, and subject to such restrictions and conditions, as it may think fit; 
but that nothing in these provisions shall affect the provisions of the elementary 
education act of 1876. The new act further authorized the home secretary to assign 
a factory inspector the duty of seeing whether the restrictions and conditions of the 
licenses above referred to were complied with, with power to enter and inspect the 
place of employment.

EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM OF ENGLAND. “OAT 
Evening schools—The attendance upon evening schools has been 
steadily declining since the early years of the operations of the educa- 
tion act. In 1890 it was 43,347 as against 77,918 in 1870, This declineis 
due in part, at least, to the diffusion of elementary instruction. It is, 
however, generally recognized that the evening schools are not meeting 
the demands which exist, and their improvement is one of the matters — 
exciting discussion. : 
Special classes.—The bill making provision for the education of the 
blind and deaf-mute is still pending, meanwhile they are admitted — 
ander specified conditions to board schools. Provision for vagrant or — 
truant children is made in reformatory and industrial schools, estab- 
lished under an act of 1866, or day industrial schools, established by 
school boards, under the education act of 1876.   
The report of the inspector of reformatory and industrial schools (Lieut. Col. 
Inglis), for 1890, shows the total number of schools under inspection to be 225, via: 
55 reformatory schools, 141 industrial schools, 10 truant schools, and 19 day indus- 
trialschools; of these 3 are reformatory and 8 are industrial schoolships. This shows 
an increase of 2 industrial schools and 1 day industrial school, and a decrease of 1 re- 
formatory schoolin the year. Allthe truant schools and all the day industrial schools, 
with the exception of 1 in Liverpool and 3 in Glasgow, are under the management of 
scheol boards. The total umber of juveniles under sentence of detention in reform- 
atory and industrial schools at the close of 1890 was 28,589, viz: 23,509 boys and 
5,080 girls, this being an increase of 504 boys and 8 girls as compared with the pre- 
vious year, There were also at the end of the year 3,698 children attending day 
industrial schools. . 
  Auxiliary agencies—England is particularly characterized by the 
number and variety of associations for the promotion of elementary 
education. There is also a noticeable tendency on the part of teachers | 
and officials to form societies for conference and mutual benefit. The 
National Union of. Elementary Teachers is one of the largest organiza- 
tions of the kind in the world, numbering above 16,000 members. This 
association has been active in the support of measures for improving 
the condition of teachers, and especially for freeing their work from 
unnatural restraints. : 
Recent departures.—The most important educational movements now 
going on in England are the university extension movement, which 
has been very fully reported in the United States; the movement for 
the remission of school fees, a measure of great interest to all. Eng- 
lish speaking people on account of its relation to the policy of private 
versus public control of public funds; and the provision made for the 
increase of technical instruction. In accordance with the technical-ed- 
ueation act of 1889, local authorities may levy a penny rate to be ap- 
plied to technical education. The movement to this end has been ac- 
celerated the present year (1890) by the local-taxation (customs and 
excise) act. By this act a large sum of money (£700,000=$3,500,000) 
has been placed at the disposal of the county councils of England and 
Wales with the privilege of applying the same to technical education. 
 
-P-A-G-E-276
  248 EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90, 
Under the spur of this provision agencies are being organized all over 
the country for the promotion of this work. In many cases these funds 
will be applied to schools and classes already in operation and fostered 
by annual grants from the public treasury. The distribution of these 
grants is committed to the science and art department, which, like the 
education department, is under the general control of the committee of 
council on education. 
Operations of the science and art department.—This department, which 
includes the whole of Great Britain, now expends £500,000 ($2,500,000) 
annually, which is applied in the following manner: 
(a) Grants for children of the industrial classes, who take science or drawing at 
school and pass the science and art examinations. 
(b) Grants to students who have passed the stage of elementary instruction, and 
who study in special science and art schools under inspection by the department. 
(c) Grants of scholarships and prizes to enable promising students to proceed 
with their studies. 
(d) Grants for apparatus, laboratories, museums, ete. 
(e) Maintenance at London of training schools for teachers, i. e., the Normal School 
of Science and the National Art Training School. 
In 1890 the number of students pursuing science subjects in schools, 
with a view to the examinations of the department, was 108,857, and 
the same year the number of persons who received instruction in art 
in some form through the agency of the department was 1,023,950. 
The increase in this work during the last twenty years is as striking as 
that in the elementary school work. 
Since 1872 the science pupils under the department have increased 
by 196 per cent; art students by 250 per cent since 1879, as against an 
increase of 222 per cent in the average attendance upon elementary 
schools since 1870. The Government expenditure through the science 
and art department rose from £184,796 ($923,980) in 1870-71 to 
‘£473,102 ($2,365,510) in 1890-91. 3 
As regards elementary education the material does not permit the 
comparison as to funds to be carried farther back than 1877-78. 
In that year the grants allowed amounted to £1,316,863 as against 
£3,263,342 in 1890, or an increase of 148 per cent in twelve years, In the 
former year the grant was equivalent to 13s. 34d. per scholar in aver- 
age attendance, and in the latter to 17s.103d. The gain per capita 
(35.6 per cent) is evidence of improvement in results.

EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM OF FRANCE AND OPERATIONS FOR 1888-89, 
Central control and supervision Education forms in France a depart- 
ment of public affairs under a cabinet officer—the. minister of public 
instruction and fine arts. He is the chief of a highly centralized, thor- 
oughly organized system, exercising his authority through a vast body 
of officials belonging to the central administration or to local divisions. 
(M. Léon Bourgeois assumed the portfolio March 17, 1890.) 
The chief officers of the central administration, after the minister, are 
the directors, one at the head of each section of the ministry, é. ¢., sec- 
retaryship and accounts, primary instruction, secondary instruction, 
superior instruction, and the section of fine arts. These directors are 
chosen with reference to their special aptitudes for the duties involved. 
M. F. Buisson is the present director of primary instruction, M. Louis 
Liard of superior, both well known in this country. M. Rabier is the 
director of the secondary department. The director of the section of 
fine arts, M. Gustave Larroumet, has the oversight of public buildings, 
preservation of monuments, etc.”

  250 _ EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90: 
The councils—The danger of the exercise of arbitrary authority is 
obviated by the constitution of elective councils, exercising delibera- 
tive, advisory, and judicial functions, The chief of these is the supe- 
rior council. This comprises sixty members, one-fourth of whom are 
appointed by the president of the republic and the remainder chosen 
by their peers from the three orders of instruction. The laws and de- 
erees by which the operations of the system are controlled are not arbi- 
trary dicta, but the final expression of the matured advice of this body. 
The matters submitted for consideration are discussed in the perma- 
nent section, which meets every week, and finally brought before the 
entire body, which holds two annual sessions, one in July, the other in 
December.’ 
The minister is represented throughout the country by a staff of gen- 
eral inspectors (ten for secondary instruction, nine for primary, and 
several assigned to special service). There are also four general in- 
spectresses of infant schools (écoles maternelles). : 
Local administration—The Imperial University, created by Napoleon 
in 1806 and invested with the complete control of education, was divided 
into académies. These divisions (seventeen in number, including one 
in Algiers) are still retained. Each aeadémie is presided over by a 
rector appointed by the President of the Republic upon the nomination 
of the minister of public instruction. In these académies are repeated 
the main features of the central administration, the rector being as- 
sisted by an academic council and haying under him a staff of academic 
inspectors (appointed by the minister) for the service of secondary and 
primary instruction, The rector is the official head of all the scholastic 
institutions of his académie. The departments which are civil divisions 
of France (ninety in number, including three in Algiers) are treated for 
educational purposes as subdivisions of the académies. The prefect or 
executive chief of the department is assisted by a departmental council 
in the administration of school affairs. : 
Finally municipalities and communes are districts of educational ad- 
ministration. Here the primary schools are brought into touch with 
the people themselves, whose direct representatives share with state 
officials the duties of inspection, The mayors of communes, cantonal 
delegates, and members of the departmental councils appointed for the 
service have, by a decree of January 18, 1887, supervision with respect 
to hygienic and moral conditions. They need no certificate of aptitude 
for these services, which they render without pay. The officers of the 
state, on the contrary, are salaried and provided with certificates of 
qualification. They exercise supervision over the scholastic work of the 
schools. Although the academic rector has general supervision ovér 
all schools of the académie, other duties prevent his coming into vital

relation with the primary schools. The academic inspectors (one for 3 
each department) have the actual direction of primary instruction. 
They name the candidates from whom the prefects of departments may 
appoint full teachers; have the sole appointment of probationers and a 
large measure of control over all teachers. They must approve the time-_ 
tables of individual schools, preside over conferences of teachers and 
receive the reports of the primary inspectors of their respective depart- 
ments. 
The primary eigudecand come into the most intimate relations with 
individual schools. By the law of March 15, 1880, from which this — 
service dates, there should be one primary inspector for each of the 362 
arrondissements, but the multiplication of schools made this number 
much too small for the demand, and by the law of October 30, 1886, the - 
minister was authorized to determine the number of these officials in 
each department. They have reached a total of 450, which gives a 
mean of 150 schools for each, whereas the ideal is 100 schools, These 
inspectors are selected upon the results of a special examination. They 
receive a salary of $560, $640, or $720, according to their location, and 
$2 a day for traveling expenses when in cireuit. Their oversight ex- 
tends to the infant schools, also, although these are the special care of a 
general delegate appointed by the minister, departmental delegates 
appointed by the rectors, and local committees of women, who look 
particularly after the sanitary and hygienic conditions of the school 
premises and the moral well-being of the children. 
It should be noted that private schools must be open to the inspec- 
tion of all the officials here mentioned, but their oversight in these is 
limited to matters of sanitation, hygiene, and morals. They may 
also prefer complaints of violation of the laws or of the constitution on — 
the part of directors of private schools.} 
Scholastic institutions.—The chief cities of the académies are the seats 
of facultés, ie., groups of professors for liberal and professional educa- 
tion, corresponding to the universities of other countries. There are at 
present fifty-eight groups (including six schools of equal rank with fac- 
ultés) at twenty centers.?. At Paris there are the five facultés of law, 
medicine, theology (Protestant), science, and letters. The other cities 
have two or more groups. These, with the state classical colleges (ly- 
cées, 107 in 1891), communal seconilary schools (colléges communaus, 235), 
and the public primary schools (67,340, besides 2,655 public infant 
schools (écoles maternelles) make up the series of institutions of which 
the academic rectors are the local heads.

and Toulouse. There are also facultés at Marseilles and Montauban, and at Nantes, 
a full-course school of medicine and pharmacy.

      252 EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
The scholastic provision is completed by special state schools for 
the higher order of general or technical education, These are either 
under the exclusive control of the minister of public instruction or the 
dual control of this minister and the minister of war, of commerce, ete., 
according to their nature. Corresponding to the state facultés and 
schools are private “institutions formerly called free (libre), because 
they are free from state assistance and from the obligation to follow 
state programmes. Since, however, they are under the general super-’ 
vision of the minister, and must have his sanction for their foundation, 
they pertain in a certain sense to his province. 
The enrollment in these several classes of institutions at the latest 
date of report was as follows: 
Primary schools, ages 6-13 (1888-89): Public; pupils, 4,450,351 (boys 2,462,671, 
girls 1,987,680); teachers, 100,913. Private; pupils, 1,176,550 (boys 373,721, girls 
802,829) ; teachers, 41,747, or atotal enrollment of 5,626,901 pupils as against 5,616,510 
in 1887-88, and a total of 142,660 teachers as against 138,655 the previous year.! 
In the state lycées for boys, ages 8 to 18, the students numbered 35,864 in 1889, and 
in the colléges communaux 48,911, or a total of 84,775. The year following the total 
had fallen to 84,186. The same year there were in the private lycées and seminaries 
90,327 students, giving a total of 174,513 in this grade of scholastic work.? 
The lycées and local colleges for girls in 1890 enrolled 7,043 pupils. On the 15th 
of January, 1891, there were on the registers of the state facultés 20,785 students, 
and in the private facultés 931, giving a total of 21,716? students pursuing supe- 
rior courses, not including the special schools. 
Judging from the fuller reports of 1887-88, we might add about 2,200 students for 
the students of secondary courses for girls and those of special schools. The sevy- 
eral estimates are near enough in point of time to be united. They give a total of 
5,832,962 students, or 15.26 per cent of the legal population,‘ private seminaries and 
conyent schools for girls not included. Of this total, 78 per cent are in public in- 
stitutions. The primary schools, écoles maternelles, not included enroll 14.72 per cent 
of the population, while the attendance upon the classical lycées and colleges for 
boys is equivalent to 1 for every 219 pes and upon superior courses 1 for 
every 1,760 inhabitants. 
Sources of support.—The costs of the public system are met by state, 
' departmental, and communal appropriations with the addition of 
  
      tuition fees in public lycées, colleges, and superior institutions and a 
small proportion of gifts and legacies. 
The state appropriation for 1891 amounted to $34,674,505, of which 
70.88 per cent was for primary instruction. The proposed appropria- 
tion for 1892 is $35, eo 125, of which 70.28 per cent is for primary in- 
struction.>

The current expenditure for primary education in 1888 amounted to 
$30,763,541; of this sum $22,494,741 represented obligatory expendi- 
tures, ¢. e., those required by law, and $8,268,750 optional expenditures. 
The obligatory expenditure was borne as follows: State, 69.06 per 
cent; communes, 26.38 per cent; departments, 4.56 per cent. Of the 
entire obligatory expenditure 93.42 per cent was for teachers’ salaries. 
The optional expenditure, which was borne almost entirely by the com- 
munes, included payments for school furniture, care of premises, pur- 
chase of prizes, ete. (75 per cent of total) and supplements to teachers’ 
salaries (22 per cent). The balance went for the support of optional 
schools. The total expenditure was distributed as follows: State, 50.67 
per cent; communes, 46 per cent; departments, 3.33 per cent.! 
TEACHERS AND PROFESSORS. 
Teaching in all public institutions is a state service regulated by law 
or by ministerial decree. 
Qualifications, classification, and discipline of primary teachers.— 
Teachers of primary schools, if women, must not be under 17 years of 
age, if men, not under 18, and must be provided with a diploma of the 
first or second grade (brevet élémentatre; supérieur) secured by exami- 
nation before a board appointed by the academic rector. This require- 
ment had been met in 1888-89; in public primary schools by 96 per 
cent of the teachers on a total of 100,913, in private primaries by 80.63 
per cent on a total of 41,747. 
Of the teachers in public primary schools, 55,987 were men; 44,926 
women; the corresponding numbers for private schools were 9,194 and 
32,553, 
Teachers are classified as titulaires (having full appointment) and 
stagiaires (probationers). Titulaires must have had two years’ expe- 
rience in the service and must also have passed the examination for 
the certificat Paptitude pédagogique. They receive their appointment 
from the prefects (chief of departments) choice, however, being con- 
fined to lists furnished by the departmental councils and approved by 
the academic inspectors. Stagiaires are appointed by the academic in- 
spectors. They constituted about 20 per cent of the total force em- 
ployed in 1887. Titulaires have a life tenure which may be forfeited 
by misconduct; they may be pensioned at 60 years of age, after thirty 
years’ service, and enter upon the enjoyment of an income equal at its 
maximum to one-half the mean annual salary which they had reached. 
The teaching force comprises besides the regular teachers, special 
teachers, @. e., teachers of language, manual training, etc. The quali- 
fication and appointment of these and also of teachers of departmental 
normal schools which are classified with the primaries, are as carefully 
and minutely regulated as those of the teachers already described. 
Teachers are subject to reprimand by the academic inspector and to

censure by the same official, cause being shown by the departmental 
council, The severe penalty of revocation may be pronounced by ae 
prefect, the case being presented by the council. 
Suspension and dismissal are inflicted by a decree of the depart- 
_ mental couneils, the teacher having the right of appeal to the-supe- 
rier council. é 
Salaries—Principal teachers are divided into three groups, viz, ele- 
mentary, superior primary, and normal; each group is divided into five 
classes, with annual salaries paid by the State as follows: 
  
Primary schools. | superior| Normal schools.

_An additional sum of $40 is allowed principals in charge of a school 
of three or four classes, and of $80 for a school of more than four classes. 
Promotion from one grade of salary to the next may be made with- 
outa change of place; it depends upon the length and eflicieney of 
service and can only take place when there is a vacancy. 
Communes may, and often do, supplement these salaries. Moreover, 
every commune must provide its teachers with free residence or with 
a money indemnity for the same at fixed rates. 
Teachers pledged to teach ten years in public schools are exempted 
from ten years’ military service after one year in camp. 
Qualifications and salaries of professors of secondary and superior 
instruction—Professors of lycées and of colléges communaux ave ap- 
pointed by the minister of public instruction; professors of the facultés 
by the President of the Republic, upon the proposition of the minister. 
The choice in the latter case must be made from two lists, one presented 
by the council of facultés in which the appointment is to be made, the 
other by the permanent section of the superior council. All profes- 
sors must be men of liberal. education, having obtained university de- 
grees. Salaries of professors, which are paid by the state, are higher 
in Paris and Lyons than in the provinces. 
The range of salaries for principals of lycées is from $1,200 to $1,800: 
for professors, from $640 to $1,500. In the departmental facultés pro- 
fessors are graded into-four classes, with salaries ranging from $1,200 
- to $2,200. In Paris there are but twe grades of full professors, with 
salaries of $2,400 and $3,000, in law and in medicine; $1,300, and $1,600 
in the faculté of Protestant theology.” -

_ EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM OF FRANCE. 255 
Training of teachers.—The state makes large provision for the train- _ 
ing of teachers and professors. Under Guizot’s law of June 28, 1833, 
every department must maintain a normal school. This obligation was 
extended by the law of August 9, 1879, which requires every depart- 
ment to maintain a normal school for men and one for women. The 
two schools may be combined, if the superior council approves and the 
minister of public instruction sanctions the application to that effect. 
‘Candidates for admission to these schools must have ebtained the brevet 
_ lémentaire, and for graduation must pass the examination for the brevet 
supérieur. A practice school is connected with each normal school, and 
with each normal school for women an additional infant ceo for 
practice. 
In 1887 all the departments, excepting Oran (Algiers), had complied 
with the law as to normal schools for men, and in 1888 all but eight had 
an additional school for women. The pees showed 90 schools for 
men, with 5,443 students, 606 nonresident professors, and 489 resident 
directors and assistants; 81 schools for women, with 3,544 students, 415 
nonresident professors, and 474 resident directors and assistants. The 
number of graduates in 1887 was 1,709 men and 1,310 women. This 
gives a total of 19,754 graduates from 1877-to 1888, inclusive. The ex- 
_ penditure for the departmental normals in 1887 amounted to $1,800,095, 
of which the departments furnished 83.25 per cent and the state 15.33; 
the remainder came from private revenues. 
To insure sound pedagogic training in the departmental normals, the 
state has established two superior normal schools, one for men (St. 
Cloud) and a second for women (Fontenay-aux-Roses). These furnish 
professors for the local normals. 
The superior normal school at Paris, maintained by the state, is the 
alma mater of a large proportion of the most celebrated. professors, both 
of the lycées and of facultés. It is maintained at an annual cost of 
abeut $103,000 and receives annually about 130 students. The state 
also maintains a special normal school at Sevres. for professors of lycées 
for girls. A chair of education has been created in the Paris facultés of 
letters and courses in pedagogies opened in several provincial facultés. 
Subjects and courses of instruction.—The subjects of instruction for 
primary schools are fixed by the law of March 28, 1882. They com- 
prise: Moral and civic instruction, reading, writing, the elements of 
arithmetic’ and the metric system; history and geography, especially of 
France; object lessons, and the first notions of science; elements of de- 
sign, of singing, manual work (needlework in the schools for girls), 
gymnastie exereises, and in the schools for boys military drill. 
In the superior primary schools these branches of instruction are re- 
viewed and more fully developed. The course is extended to include 
algebra and geometry; natural science and physics, and their appliea- — 
tion to agriculture, to industrial arts and to hygiene; political economy, 
French language and literature, general history, industrial and com- 
  
apie st aes 
 
-P-A-G-E-284
    256 : EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
mercial geography, iron and wood work for boys, and cutting and. fit- 
ting for girls. One foreign language is also included. Additional 
courses pertaining to local industries may be authorized by the min- 
ister upon the demand of local committees, supported by the academic 
inspector and approved by the departmental council. 
Normal schools.—In the primary (i. e., departmental) normal schools 
the studies of the primary course are reviewed with reference to meth- 
ods of instruction, and at the same time developed to include the full 
scope and scholastic bearing of those subjects. Pedagogy and school 
administration are treated both theoretically and practically. 
Instruction in the following subjects is given outside the regular class 
hours: in the normal schools for men, agriculture and manual work, 
military and gymnastic exercises, vocal and instrumental music; in the 
normal schools for women, needlework, housework and gardening, gym- 
nastics, and vocal and instrumental music. The course of study in 
these schools covers three years. 
The courses of study for secondary and superior institutions are 
elaborated in the superior council, due consideration being given to the 
opinions of the several facultés which are formally submitted by the 
academic rectors. These courses form a continuous scheme of study, 
starting at an elementary stage (i. e., for pupils 8 years of age) and 
comprising the entire province of general and special knowledge. A 
relation has also been established between the lycée courses and primary 
instruction through the nonclassical division of the lycées, created in 
1865 as a special course (enseignement secondaire spécial), and changed 
to modern course (enseignement secondaire moderne) by decree of June 5, 
1891. 
The course of the lycées leads to the bachelor’s degree, which is 
the first of the series of university degrees, 7. e., bachelor, licencié and 
doctor. Candidates for degrees must be inscribed in the faculté cor- 
responding to the degree sought, pay the required-fees, and sustain the 
examinations. Only those who take inscriptions, as it is called, are 
classed as students. In addition, large companies of hearers attend 
the lectures of the professors. Candidates for degrees may pursue 
their advanced courses either under the facultés, in special schools 
or under private tuition. 
The bachelor’s degree stamps one as a man of liberal culture; it is, 
moreover, a necessary prerequisite to the higher degrees (licencié and 
doctor), which are the passports to professional careers. 
Organizations and conduct of institutions—The system of education 
reflects in its general structure the underlying theory of education as 
an integral process of development and the prerogative of all classes 
of society. *The specializations of the system appear in the organiza- 
tion and conduct of institutions. These specializations can not well be 
set forth in an outline view. It may be said, in brief, that all institu- 
tions of the same grade are alike in their general features, which are 
determined by law or by ministerial decree.

  EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM OF FRANCE. 257 
CHARACTERISTIC FEATURES OF PUBLIC PRIMARY SCHOOLS, 
The features common to all public primary schools pertain to’ classi- 
fi cation, establishment, and pedagogic organization. i 
Classification.—Primary schools are divided into infant schools 
(écoles maternelles) for children 2 to 6 years of age; elementary primary 
schools 6 to 13 years inclusive,-é. e., the period of obligatory instruc- 
tion; higher primaries (écoles primaires supérieures, and cours complé- 
mentaires) 12 to 14 or 16 years, and schools of manual apprenticeship, 
which partake theoretically of the character both of high schools and 
of technical schools as these terms are understood in our own country. 
The statistics for 1888-89 show the following distiribution of pupils: 
Ecoles maternelles.—Public, 464,110 pupils (with 5,100 directors and assistants); 
private, 243,412 pupils (with 3,472 directors and assistants), or a total enrollment of 
707,522 as against 712,897 in 1887-88. Primaries—public, 4,450,351 pupils; private 
1,176,550, or a total of 5,626,901. Of these, 37,930 pupils were in the écoles primaires 
supcricures, and cow's complémentaires. 
Schools of manual apprenticeship have as yet little development. 
It is noticeable that the enrollment in primary schools has varied 
little in three years, the increase since 1886 being 26,482, Classes 
maintained for adults had an attendance of 181,099 pupils (155,781) 
men, 25,318 women) as against 187,168 in 1887-88, ; 
Ystablishment.—The law requires every commune to establish at 
least one public elementary primary school, an obligation which in 
1888-89 had been met by all but 68 communes out of a total of 36,121. 
Communes haying more than 500 inhabitants must establish a separate 
school for girls unless a mixed school is sanctioned by the departmental 
council. Of 18,940 communes to which this provision -apphes all but 
1,624 had domphed’ in 1888-89. 
Coeducation declines as this provision extends. The detailed statis- 
tics for 1888-89 show that of the 4,446,851 pupils in the public primary 
schools 2,459,497 were boys and 1,987,354 were girls. Of the entire 
number only 729,305 were in areal schools, a decline of 3 per cent 
since 1S85-86. 
The establishment-of all other classes of primary schools is optional 
with the communes. Although the establishment of primary schools is 
a charge upon the communes, the state has aided liberally in the work. 
From June 1, 1878, to December, 1888, inclusive, there were expended 
in the construction, repair, and furnishing of schoolhouses $107,225,191, 
of which the state contributed 39 per cent, the departments 2.76, and 
the communes 58.24 per cent. 
1These schools, which the communes have the power to establish, must not be con- 
founded with the écoles nationales professionelles, These are schools designed for the’ 
complete education of children, including their preparation for practical industries 
or for admission to higher technical schools, Three such schools have already been 
established, i. e., at Voiron, Armentiéres, and Vierzon, respectively.

Gradation.—The course of elementary primary schools is arranged in 
three grades—elementary (cours élémentatre), for children 7 to 9 years of 
age; intermediate (cours moyen), 9 to 11; superior (cours supérieur), 11 
to13. There is usually an infant class for children under 7. Each divi- 
sion comprises two classes. The primary inspector superintends the 
classification of pupils at. the beginning of the school year. Promo- 
tions are made annually. A pupil who has passed the examination 
for the certificate of primary studies which may be taken at 11 years 
of age can enter the cours supérievr. This examination is not obliga- 
tory, but the number of candidates seeking it steadily increases. In 
1889 certificates were awarded to 165,211 pupils, about double the num- 
ber in 1882. 
The programmes of individual schools are determitied in the depart- 
- mental councils, and vary in different localities. Each teacher must 
arrange a time table for his own school, which, after approval by the . 
academy inspector, must be hung up in the schoolroom. 
Compulsory attendance.—The law of June 16, 1881, making instruction 
in publie primary schools gratuitous, was followed within a year (March 
28, 1882) by a compulsory law. This obliges parents and guardians to 
_ seeure the attendance of their children or wards upon primary instruc- 
tion under penalty of fine or imprisonment. Local school attendance 
committees (commissions scolaires) are constituted to keep watch over 
‘the matter and report violations of thelaw. Parents may choose either 
publie or private schools or home instruction for their children. In the 
last case children must pass an examination in the work of the public 
schools each year of the compulsory period after the first. If the ex- 
amination be unsatisfactory the parent must place the child in a public 
or private school. Furthermore, by means of communal funds (caisses 
des écoles) which, under the law of Mareh 28, 1882, every commune 
must establish, necessary aid is extended to poor children to facilitate 
their attendance. The number of these caisses in 1890 was 16,175; the 
funds amounted to $1,026,358; the amount disbursed to $764,963. 
Under these very complete provisions it is not surprising that the in- 
- struction of all children between 6 and 13 years of age should have 
been practically accomplished. 
According to the census of 1886 there were 4,729,511 children of school 
age, 7. e., 6 to 13 inclusive, in France. At the rate of increase prevail- 
ing from 1881 to 1886, the total in 1888 would have become 4,786,265. 
The children of school age on the registers of primary schools (infant 
schools included) in 1888-S9 was 4,691,218, or 98 per cent of the esti- 
mated total. ‘ 
The number between the specified ages attending lycées and loeal 
colleges and receiving instruction at home would very nearly make up 
the balance. 
It is not so easy to determine the regularity of school attendance. 
The only statistics bearing upon this point are the results of enumera- 
 
-P-A-G-E-287

tions made in 1886-87 at two selected dates. From this it appears 
that the number of children present in public primary schools on the © 
4th of December, 1886, season of the highest attendance, was equal to 
91 per cent of the enrollment at that time, and to 79 per cent of the 
annual enrollment; the number present on the 4th of June, 1887, season 
of lowest attendance, was 88 per cent of the enrollment at that time, and 
72 per cent of the annual enrollment.! 
Secular character of public schools—The law making primary in- 
struction compulsory confined that of the public schools: strictly to 
secular branches. The law of October 30, 1886, went still farther and 
prohibited any but persons belonging to the laity from teaching in the 
public schools. The five years allowed for the elimination of teachers 
belonging to religious orders from the schools for boys have just elapsed. 
The enforcement of this provision has been resisted in several places 
with the ultimate result of the transfer of pupils from publie to pa- 
rochial schools. The relative number of primary schools under lay and 
religious teachers in 1889-90 is brought into comparison with the same 
in 1878-79 in the following totals:?

It appears from the above table that 5,218 public schools have been 
transferred from clerical to lay control, or suppressed during the decade. 
Of these, 1,489 were schools for boys, 3,224 for girls, and 505 for both 
sexes. During the same time there was an increase of 3,790 in the 
number of private parochial schools, viz, 1,198 schools for boys, 2,558 
schools for girls, 34 for both sexes. Onthe whole, primary lay schools 
have made a gain above primary parochial of 6,015 schools and 118,002 
pupils. The moyement in the écoles maternelles has been just the re- 
verse. Here there is a diminution of 407 lay schools with 5,894 pupils, 
and a gain of 1,062 denominational schools with 106,945 pupils. 
Lycées and facultés.—The authority of the state in respect to the in- 
ternal management of higher institutions is not less positive than in 
respect to primary schools. The state takes the initiative in the estab- 
lishment of lycées, the communes in establishing local colleges (colléges 
communaux). The organization and conduct of these institutions are 
matters of elaborate regulation developed in the superior council,

decreed by the minister, and administered by the principals under the 
supervision of the academic rectors and councils. 
The facultés are created by the state for the service of superior and 
‘professional instruction. Until recently they were wanting in all the 
attributes of autonomy. Civil personality was conferred upon them in 
1885 by a decree authorizing them to receive, hold, and administer 
property, and the work of organization was begun by the creation of a 
council-general of all the facultés (conseil général des facultés) of an 
academic district, and a general assembly and a council of each indi- 
vidual faculté. The council-general of the several facultés of an académie 
consists of the deans of the faculties, together with two representatives 
from each faculty, chosen by their colleagues. It is presided over by 
the academic rector. This body regulates scholastic affairs of general 
interest to all the facultés, and has control of the finances, The gen- 
eral assembly of each faculté, which comprises all the members of the 
Jfaculté arranges the details of the courses of instruction. The council 
of the faculté, which comprises only titular professors and professeurs 
adjoints, receives gifts and legacies on behalf of the faculté and dis- 
tributes its revenues, The creation of these governing bodies fore- 
shadows the transformation of the facultés into organic universities, a 
measure which is now under debate in the French Chambers. 
Correlation of studies—The ideal of unity which is typified in the 
administrative service of the system of education finds higher cealiza- 
tion in the correlation of the courses of study. Students of liberal and 
professional education are drawn chiefly from the higher classes of 
society; nevertheless these courses have been brought within the reach 
of the common people since the lycées have been affiliated on one side 
(i. ., enseignement secondaire moderne) to the primary schools. This pro- 
vision, moreover, has been made available by public scholarships open 
to competitive examination. 
Higher education; women.—It should be noted also that women are 
admitted to the privileges and honors of the higher courses. 
From 1875~76 to 1887~88, inclusive, university degrees to the number 
of 262 were granted to women. These included 39 in medicine, 130 in 
the sciences, 89 in classics and belles-lettres, 1 in’ pharmacy, and 3 in 
‘law. Of the whole number, 137 were obtained in Paris and the re- 
mainder in the provinces; 207 were conferred upon French women.! 
Women pursue degree courses in the state facultés or under private 
auspices. They form also a large proportion of the auditors at the 
public lectures of the faculté professors and of the Collége de France. 
Special schools.—The special schools which complete the provision 
for higher instruction, and which are under the exclusive control of the 
minister of public instruction and fine arts, are the Collége de France, 
Ecole Normale Supérieure, Muséum d’Histoire Naturelle, Ecole Fran- 
caise de Rome, Lcole Francaise d’Athénes, Ecole Nationale des Chartes,

Ausiliary agencies.—The progress of education is fostered by many 
auxiliary agencies, both public and private. The most important of 
the former as regards the interests of primary education is the Musée 
Pédagogique. This includes a museum and a library for the collection 
of all material and publications which may aid the work or the researches 
of persons engaged in primary instruction. Here, also, classes and 
courses of lectures for teachers are maintained and publications issued 
which make known the best methods of instruction, the best plans for 
the construction and equipment of schoolhouses, and the results of 
many valuable historical investigations.’

    ELEMENTARY EDUCATION IN LONDON AND PARIS, 
The operations of the systems of elementary education in England 
and France are most strikingly displayed in the capital cities of the 
two nations. In England, it is true, particular features of the system 
are more highly developed in provincial cities,’ but the magnitude ot 
the work in London gives it surpassing interest. ; 
In Paris the French system naturally reaches itS highest possibili- 
ties; here it is that the theory, which in France always precedes prac- 
tice, is elaborated and here the agencies for carrying out the theory 
are most perfectly organized. Many interesting points of likeness are 
noticeable in the educational provision of the two cities. In both the 
. work is divided between public and private schools (chiefly parochial) 
and in both the utilitarian results of elementary instruction are kept 
steadily in view. On the other hand the radical differences between   
1Prepated by A. Tolman Smith, specialist in British and French school systems. 
®Birmingham has an organized system of schools comprising elementary schools 
for children from 31012 or 13 years of age; seven grammar schools carrying education 
up to 16 years, and two high schools, one for boys, the other for girls. Fees are 
charged in the higher schools, but one-third of the places are free. There is also a 
free higher grade-school founded by the school board for giving two years’ training 
in science and drawing to boys from elementary schools. The crown of this system 
is the Municipal Technical School. z

the systems are most plainly manifest in the cities, which offer the 
widest fields for their operation. Apart from these differences there 
is a noticeable contrast in the spirit which pervades their operations. 
This is a difference which is more easily felt than expressed. In Lon. 
don there is a constant disposition to restrain the province of cle- 
mentary schools; in Paris there is a constant tendency to extend their 
province and to correlate them to higher institutions. 
Prior to 1870 public elementary schools did not exist in London; in 
Paris they date back to 1830, but the supply of school places has been 
increased by 68 per cent since 1871. At that time the 256 schools pos- 
sessed by the city were badly organized and answered neither to peda- 
gogic nor to hygienic requirements. The 109 schools since created have 
been provided with excellent buildings well furnished and equipped 
while many of the older buildings have been reconstructed. Moreover 
thé laws by which these schools are regulated have all been passed. 
since the date specified (1871) and the Paris schools have become part 
of a national system. 
SUPERVISORY AUTHORITIES. 
London school board.—In accordance with the education act of 1870, 
the board schools of London are managed by a board elected by the 
ratepayers for three years. It comprises 55 members, organized in 
ten or eleyen standing committees. In 1890, the board employed a 
permanent staff of 406 officers and clerks at an annual expenditure for 
salaries of £59,990 ($299,950).?. Of this staff 33 members were inspect- 
ors or superintendents of instruction, six were school-visitors. There 
were also 275 additional visitors® employed to canvass every district of 
the city, to search out all children of school age (3 to 13), and to make 
a record of their names, home conditions, and status with reference to 
school attendance. The board officials act independently of the gov- 
ernment inspectors, whose relation to the schools of the metropolis is 
the same as to those of the county at large. 
The present board, whose term expires in November, 1891, is the 
seventh elected under the education act. The chairman, Mr. J. R. 
Diggle, is serving his second term in that position, having succeeded 
Mr. Edward North Buxton upon the defeat of the progressive party 
in 1885. 
Paris administrative service.—In respect to educational administra- 
tion, Paris pertains to the Department of the Seine, one of the nine 
departments of the Académie de Paris. The rector of this académie 
is the minister of public instruction, but the duties of the office are per- 
formed by the vice-rector, an office filled since February 11, 1879, by

M. O. Gréard. On account of the unusual demands of this depart- 
ment, several academic inspectors are appointed by the minister for the 
supervision of educational affairs. One of these, who bears the title 
of director of primary instruction of the Department of the Seine, is 
specially charged with the direction of primary instruction under the 
control of the prefect of the department. To this officer is confided 
the oversight of all matters pertaining to elementary schools, even the 
choice of sites, the construction and furnishing of buildings, which in 
other cities of France are included in the general municipal adminis- 
tration. An under-director shares in the general control. 
The administrative functions are exercised through four bureaus, #. ¢., 
a central bureau charged with the creation and the material and ped- 
agogic organization of all institutions for public instruction and with 
the general business of the department, a bureau pertaining to the in- 
terests of the teaching body, one for the administration of funds, the 
conduct of examinations, etc., and a fourth charged with the accounts 
of the municipal establishments. There is also a secretaryship for cor- 
respondence and for various special services. 
The service of inspection is of two orders, pedagogic and adminis- 
‘ trative. For the pedagogic inspection, there are 17 primary inspectors, 
state officials appointed by the minister of public instruction and placed 
under the authority of the director of primary instruction, and 6 depart- 
mentalinspectresses of infant schools (¢coles maternelles). The city also 
inaintains 15 inspectors and 6 inspectresses whose supervision relates 
to drawing, music, gymnastics, manual training, bookkeeping, and for- 
eign languages. a 
For the administrative service, the city. maintains 2 principal in- 
spectors, 5 inspectors for the schools of boys, 6 inspectresses for the 
schools for girls, and 3 for infant schools (écoles maternelles). 
An interesting feature of the supervision maintained by the city is 
the service of medical inspection which was regularly organized in 
1879, and more perfectly systematized in 1884. The number of medical 
inspectors (who must be regularly graduated doctors) now employed is 
126. Every school is inspected once a month as to its sanitary condi- 
tions, and at the same time the children are individually examined with 
a view to determining their general physical condition, and more par- 
ticularly to testing the state of their eyes, ears, mouths, ete, The 
annual expenditure for this service has reached $20,160. 
Each arrondissement or municipal district has moreover a local sery- 
ice of supervision comprising the mayor and several assistants.! Can- 
tonal delegates and special committees codperate in this local service, 
which is rendered gratuitously.” 
The London board has charge only of public elementary schools, é 
1 Each of the twenty districts (arrondissements) of Paris has its own mayor.

private elementary schools, although sharing in the Government grant, 
being wholly under their respective managers. In Paris, on the con- 
trary, the director of public instruction exercises a measure of super- 
vision over private schools. 
SCHOOL ATTENDANCE. 
Ages for attendance and school population—Complete statistics of 
school attendance are attainable for both cities; beyond this, the Tee 
of operations is limited to the public schools. 
The ages for school attendance, recognized in London as in En land 
generally, are from 3 to 13, inclusive; the compulsory by-laws made by 
the board are applicable to children from 5 to 12 years, inclusive, unless 
they have passed the sixth grade,' which is the standard for exemption 
_ under the by-laws of the board, at an earlier age than 12, Paris is under 
the general law of compulsory school attendance in France, which covers 
the ages 6 to 13, inclusive. With these arrangements in mind, it is in- 
teresting to compare the school provision and school attendance in the 
two cities. 
The magnitude of the work of London is suggested by the population. 
According to the census of 1891 this had reached a total of 5,633,332, 
including outer London, a population greater than that of any one of 
the United States, New York alone excepted. If outer London be 
omitted, the population of registration London (4,211,056) is still ex- 
ceeded by two of our States only, i. e., New York and Pennsylvania. 
Out of this population there is an estimated school population of 
826,477,” i. e., six-sevenths of the children between 3 and 13 years of 
age, one-seventh being deducted for the children of the upper classes, 
“who are not expected to attend the elementary schools. The visitors 
employed by the board in 1890 succeeded in scheduling 786,350 children 
3 to 13 years of age, of whom 615,762 were presumably between 5 and 13.3 
Paris, with a population a little more than half that of registration 
London (i. ¢., 2,447,957 in 1890), has a school population relatively 
smaller and much more homogeneous. In 1886, the number of children 
of school age (i. ¢., from 6 years completed to 13, inclusive) was 206,077.4

ELEMENTARY EDUCATION IN LONDON AND PARIS. 267 
No recent enumeration of the eileen of the proper age for infant 
schools (%. ¢., 2 to 6 years) has been reported. 
Statistics of accommodation, enrollment, and attendance; London,—The 
elementary schools of London (publie and private), aided by the Goy- 
ernment grant, afforded, in 1890, accommodation for 680,423 children, 
or 824 per cent of the estimated number 3 to 13 years of age. Three- 
fifths of this accommodation was in board schools. ea 
The average enrollment in both classes of schools (1889-90) was 
653,932 (i. e., 332,900 boys, 321,032 girls), equivalent to 79 per cent of 
the children 3 to 13 years. The enrollment of children between 5 and 
13 was equivalent to 91 per cent of the number between those ages 
scheduled by the visitors. Of the entire enrollment 443,143 were in’ 
board schools. 
According to an enumeration made the 25th of March, 1899, it ap- 
peared that there were 158,662 children between the ages of 3 and 13 
on the visitors’ schedules whose names were not upon the roll of effi- 
cient schools. Of these 69 per cent were accounted for as follows: in- 
structed at home or in private schools not inspected, 6,860; between . 
the ages of 3 and 5 and not yet entered in schools, 102,663. The re-' 
mainder, 49,139, comprised those who are wholly exempt, those who 
are permanently disabled, those who are in the country, those who 
are ill or delicate or who reside in houses where there is infectious ill- 
ness, those who are out of school owing to the want of accommodation or 
owing to the accommodation being unsuitable, those who are under 
surveillance by the respective divisional committees, and a few others 
who cannot be classified.”” 
The average attendance maintained in the elementary schools, pub- 
lie and private, was 510,180, or 78 per cent of the average enrollment.t 
This is not considered to be a satisfactory outcome of the great efforts 
put forth to secure the instruction of the masses, more particularly as 
nonattendance and irregular attendance are limited almost entirely 
to the lowest stratum of the people. A special.committee of the board 
have this subject under consideration with a view to devising means 
for increasing the average rate of attendance. 
According to the report of the by-laws committee (1889-90) the sey- 
eral items here considered show increase since 1871 as follows: Number 
of children of school age, increase, 36.82 per cent; accommodation in 
efficient schools, 159.44 per cent; average enrollment, 193.87 per cent; 
average attendance, 192.70 per cent? 
Paris.—According to the official report covering the year 1887-88, 
the enrollment in the primary schools of Paris for children of the com- 
pulsory ages had reached a total of 193,251 (¢. e., 92,522 boys, 100,729 
girls), or 93.77 per cent of the population of those ages, distributed as

follows: Publie schools, 62.8 per cent; private, 37.2 per cent.1 From 
an analysis of these statistics it appears that 12,613 of the children in- 
cluded were below 6 years of age and 7,676 above 13, This leaves 
23,115 children of the compulsory school age to be accounted for. Of 
these, 289 were in attendance upon higher primary schools (écoles pri- 
maires supériewres), 11,234 in secondary establishments (lycées and col- 
léges) ; 2,000, it was estimated, were instructed at home. The remainder, 
9,592, comprise those exempted by the possession of the primary certifi- 
eate or under the law governing apprenticeship and those who have 
not quite completed their sixth year. 
Allowance being made for these and for the increase of popula- 
tion from 1886 to 1888, it was estimated that in the latter year there 
were about 5,500 children, or about 24 per cent of the school population, 
with respect to whom the law of compulsory school attendance was, 
to say the least, imperfectly enforced. The number absolutely without 
instruction is, however, doubtless much smaller. Complaint is made 
that many well-to-do parents omit the formality of declaring before the 
mayor their choice as to the instruction of their children. This neglect 
of the law makes it impossible to determine precisely the status of the 
entire school population.? 
The accommodation in public schools is not equal to the demand for 
places, the number of applicants who had to be denied admission in 
1888 being 4,457. Temporary provision was made by public scholar- 
ships in private schools for 1,848 of this number.’ The public infant 
schools (écoles maternelles), which have not been included at all in the 
foregoing statement, show a similar deficiency of places. The enroll- 
ment in these in 1888 was 25,700, besides which there were 5,177 ap- 
plicants of suitable age (2 to 6) who could not be received. The city’ 
made provision in private schools for 745 of the number.* 
By a comparison of the number enrolled (inserit) in public schools 
for a specified period it appears that the average attendance in the 
schools for girls was 91.16 per cent and in the schools for boys 92.23 per 
cent of the enrollment.’ This, it will be observed, is a much higher 
ratio than has been reached in London. 
Among the influences that have conduced to this result in Paris are 
the activity of the school-attendance committees (commissions scolaires) 
and the operations of the fund for stimulating attendance (caisses des 
écoles). From 1882 to 1888, inclusive, 48,097 cases of the violation of 
the compulsory law were examined by the attendance committees. . In 
9,064 instances the names of the delinquent parents were simply pub- 
lished, 615 cases were referred to the justices of the peace; in the remain-

der the parents were admonished. The number of examinations in 
1887-88 was 8,906, of publication only 1,933, of reference to the jus- 
tices 89, For the most part it appears to be misfortune rather than 
indifference that causes the disregard of the school law.! 
In 1888 funds for promoting attendance (caisses des écoles) existed in 
every arrondissement of Paris. The total receipts were $234,443 and 
the disbursements $206,156.2, These funds are used in procuring re- 
wards for children who attend regularly and in providing. necessary 
food, clothing, and other essentials for very poor children. 
In 1880 a service of school dinners (cantines scolaires), which had 
been irregularly maintained before that date, was regularly organ- 
ized by the municipal council, the expenses to be borne by the school 
funds (caisses) and such additional gifts as might be offered. Under 
this arrangement a noonday meal is supplied gratuitously to very 
poor children or at a specified price for those who can pay. These 
dinners consist of soup, meat, and vegetables, the children supplying 
their own bread. The average price for a dinner is 3 cents. In 1888 
the daily distribution was 28,228 meals, of which 12,263 were: gratui- 
tous, The funds for the service amounted to $96,491, of which 95 per 
cent was directly appropriated by the city. Some complaint is made 
of the unequal provision in the different arrondissements, but on tae 
whole the measure seems to be a good one, especially in its effects upon 
the afternoon attendance.’ 
From the statistics here given it appears that London has an enroll- 
ment of about 91 per cent of the children 5 to 13 years and an average 
attendance of 78 per cent of the enrollment 3 to 13, as against an en- 
rollment in Paris of 94 per cent of the children 6 to 13 and an average 
attendance of 914 per cent of the enrollment. 
    SUPPORT OF ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS. 
  London.—The income of the London school board for the year end- 
ing September 29, 1890, was £2,008,868, or, omitting loans raised for 
building purposes, £1,758,868 ($8,794,340). Of this sum 20 per cent 
was derived from the Government grant and 72 per cent from the 
rates, or a total of 92 per cent from public funds. School fees and 
books sold to children yielded about 7 per cent. The small balance 
eame from endowments, gifts, ete. The total expenditure was 
£1,960,248 10s. The current expenditure (excluding purchase of sites, 
erection of buildings, school furnishings, and payments, either interest 
or principal, in loans) amounted to £1,321,874 (36,609,370). This in- 
cluded expenses of administration, 5 per cent; contributions to indus-

® The London Schools Dinner Association does a great work for poor children, but 
it can hardly be regarded as an integral part of the school system. In the stress of 
the winter (1891) $500 a week were expended for dinners, c

- trial schools, 3 per cent; expense of maintaining elementary schools, 
92 per cent; equivalent to $6,089,635. _ This last sum gives, as the ex- 
penditure per capita of average enrollment, $13.74, and per capita of 
average attendance, including that of night schools (6,700 pupils), 
$17.30. The contribution from the rates for this expenditure represents 
9.9d per pound of ratable values; the amount of. the Government 
grant was equal to 19s. 1d. ($4.95) per capita of average attendance. 
The average weekly fee charged in the schools was 2.12d.! 
Paris.—The public schools of Paris are maintained entirely by mu- 
nicipal appropriations. In 1888, these amounted to 19,853,512 franes 
  - ($3,970,702) for primary schools oe children of the compuladey ages, 
an increase of 154 per cent over the amount appropriated in 1878. The 
budget for the infant schools in 1888 was 3,606,032 franes ($721,206.50) 
and for the five higher primaries (having an Radke of 2,485 pupils) 
1,088,080 francs ($217,616). The three budgets amounted to $4,909,524, 
The Rees intion: for the primaries for children of caren ages 
included 6,348,550 francs for school furniture, rent of hired build- 
ings, and the inpeat on loans for building purposes. Deducting this 
sun, the remainder, 13,504,962 francs ($2,700,992), gives $2 
capita of enrollment, 121,362 pupils. Teachers’ salaries absorbed 63,42 
percent of the amount. The budget for infant schools included also 
expenditure for rent of buildings, purchase of furniture, and payment 
  - of interest on loans. This deducted, the balance, 1,909,132 franes 
$381,826), is equivalent to $15 per capita of enrollment in the infant 7 ? 
- schools. 
Extraordinary expenditures.—In both cities the expense of providing 
school buildings has been a heavy tax since 1870, although the burden 
is annually diminishing. A. very recent estimate for London, bringing 
the account down to 1891, gives a total expenditure for this purpose 
of £8,439,000 ($42,195,000), of which 134 per cent has been paid, leay- 
ing a debt whose annual interest amounts to $1,982,500. This is equiva- 
lent to a rate of 3d. in the pound of the present ratable value of the 
city” The sum inscribed in the municipal budget of Paris since 1871 
for the construction and furnishing of school buildings had reached in 
1886 a total of 84,160,809 francs ($16,832,162). Of this amount $3,010,- 
260 had not been exhausted.’ 
It is impossible here to go into details as to the architectural features 
of school buildings or the style and completeness of their furnishings. 
The statistics here given indicate a liberal scale of expenditure. 
In the more crowded districts of London sites were held at enormous 
prices, but the earlier boards preferred to run the risk of being charged 
with extravagance rather than to ns of securing accessible locations

and the requisite ground plan. In both cities the buildings are large, 
accommodating generally from 300 to 500 pupils (in some cases even a 
larger number), arranged in various grades and requiring suitable 
rooms for collective and for special exercises. The plans shown in the 
official reports resemble in general the graded schools of our own cities. 
An admirable feature of the more recent school buildings of Paris is 
the arrangement of the covered courts and open grounds for gymnas- 
tics, recreations, etc. It is in the courts that the school dinners are 
usually served. 
THE TEACHING FORCE, 
London.—The board schools of London, enrolling in 1889-90, as we 
have seen, 443,143 pupils, employed a total force of 8,712 teachers. Of 
these there were, adults, 7,166; namely, 2,396 men, 4,770 women, or a pro- 
portion of 1 to 2; and pupil-teachers, 1,546; namely, 298 boys and 1,248 
girls. The adult force was equivalent to 1 teacher for every 62 pupils 
enrolled and the entire number to 1 for every 50 pupils. 
The salaries paid to the adult teachers amounted to £360,398 
($4,301,990), giving a general average of $1,215 for head teachers and 
of $415 for assistant teachers.! 
Of the adult force 2,065 men and 3,134 women are classified as 
trained, 223 men and 1,214 women untrained, and 108 men and 422 
women as ex-pupil teachers. The last class can hardly be considered 
as untrained, although they have not been through the training colleges. - 
Including these the proportion of adult teachers who had been trained 
was 81 per cent. London has made provision for the instruction of its 
pupil-teachers in twelve central schools and allows them a fair propor- 
tion of time for self-improvement. 
Paris.—The public primary schools of Paris for children of the com- 
pulsory ages, enrolling (1888) 121,401 pupils, employed 3,002 teachers, 
equivalent to 1 for every 40 enrolled pupils. Of this force 1,497 were 
men and 1,505 women, an equality in numbers not likely to be found 
elsewhere. These teachers were classified as follows: Directors (i. ¢., 
in charge of schools having each two or more classes), men, 174; wo- 
men, 194, Additional teachers having full appointments, men, 1,180; 
women, 1,130. Probationers, men, 143; women, 181. As regards 
training, 374 men and 338 women were graduates from the normal 
schools of the department of the Seine, 195 men and 43 women were > 
from provincial normal schools, while 928 men and 1,124 women came 
from private establishments. All were possessed of diplomas or 
degrees, the majority having the higher grade diplomas. Of the en- 
tire force in 1888, 242 men and 239 women, or the small proportion of 
16 per cent, had only the lowest diploma (brevet élémentaire), The 
Paris teachers without exception belong to the laity.

   These rates give a general average of $879 for directors, $661 for

averages considerably above the salaries granted by the state.'| The 
indemnity or money equivalent for residence, which. the city must fur- 
nish, is $160 for directors and directresses, and $120 for additional 
teachers. re 
Additional sums are allowed for extra service. 
With the exception of two small schools each school has as many 
additional teachers as there are classes. The directors and directresses 
are occupied wholly in supervision. 
It should be added that in case of sickness or other adequate cause © 
of absence, the salary is still continued, the city bearing the expense 
of a substitute. 
The pedagogical conferences, which are held regularly, afford the 
opportunity for the completion of professional training, and each school 
is supplied with a reference library of special value to teachers. 
The number of candidates for positions in the Paris schools is much 
greater than the demand, the excess of applicants being largely for 
positions held by men.? 
SCHOLASTIC WORK OF THE SCHOOLS. 
The actual work going on in the elementary schools of the two cities 
is the matter of chief interest. This can not here be set forth with any 
fullness of detail, but keeping in mind the courses of study elaborated

for the systems to which these schools pertain,} their work may be 
indicated by the classification of their pupils. 
LONDON—BOARD SCHOOLS. 
On the 25th of March, 1890, there were on the registers of the board 
schools of London 438,056 pupils; of these 121,968 were below standard 
I, either in infant schools or infant classes. These deducted, the clas- 
sification, as regards the obligatory subjects, «4 ¢., reading, writing, 
and arithmetic, was as follows: :

Grant for English earned on an average attendance of 219,749 pu- 
pils; for geography, on an attendance of 122,492; for elementary sci- 
ence, on an attendance of 2,224; for history, on an attendance of 2,468 
pupils; and for needlework, on an average attendance of 13,333 girls.? 
In addition, grants for specific subjects* were allowed in thé case of 
34,477 pupils or 61 per cent of the pupils eligible for those subjects, 
and about 12 percent of all pupils above the infant classes. This in- 
eludes 15,560 girls who passed in cookery. 
The subjects most frequently taken in boys’ departments were ani- 
mal physiology, mechanics, and algebra, and in girls’ departments, 
cookery and domestic economy. i 
It may be noted here that coeducation prevails to a limited extent, 
about 44 per cent of pupils above the infant grade being in mixed 
departments. In the separate departments the boys outnumber the 
girls slightly. 
Examinations in drawing, under the auspices of the science and art 
department, were held in 408 departments having an average attend- 
ance of 124,938 pupils. The instructor of singing reports that all the 
schools were able to meet the requirements of the code and to earn the 
full grant at their annual examination.

results from the Swedish system of training. Among other special 
instructors are four science demonstrators for boys’ schools, and one 
lecturer for schools for girls, and four special French teachers. These 
are all visiting teachers, having classes in different schools. 
With respect to Bible teaching (which must be strictly nonsectarian) 
the school management committee say: “This isasubject which nearly 
all our best teachers enjoy, though head teachers take too little part in 
' it. In Bible teaching there is almost unlimited choice of subject, 
abundant opportunity for using apt illustrations and arousing eager 
interest.” : 
The interest of pupils is stimulated by the prizes offered by a private 
individual, Mr. Frank Peek and by the Religious Tract Society, and 
awarded upon the results of competitive examination. In 1890, the 
departments examined had an average enrollment of 306,882, of which 
number 82 per cent participated in the exercise. 
The most interesting recent departure in the schools, is the provision 
for manual training. The instruction of boys in the use of tools was 
commenced in January, 1888, under the direction of a joint com- 
mittee of the school board for London and the City and Guilds of 
London Institute. Funds for the first year to the extent of £1,000 
were supplied by the latter. A request was also made for a sum of 
£250 to enable the joint committee to try the experiment of instruction 
in laundry work for girls. : 
During 1888 and 1889, there were about 580 boys receiving manual 
instruction one half-day per week, at 6 centers. 
The classes were conducted by an organizing instructor with three 
assistants (practical artisans), whose salaries as well as the cost of 
timber, tools, etc., were paid out of the fund contributed by the City of 
Guilds Institute and the Drapers’ Company. 
Fifteen dollars of the amoun§ was distributed in prizes of books, 
tools, ete. : 
The classes are being continued, and an extended syllabus has been 
adopted, enabling the scholars who remain during the second year to 
take up more advanced work. 
Laundry classes.—In 1889, laundry classes were established at four 
centers; at the first three classes consisting of 12 girls each were held 
one day per week. The interest has been growing ever since. The 
committee are greatly encouraged to continue the work which they be- 
lieve to be doing incalculable good in elementary schools. The subject 
was recognized in the new code (1890) and provision was made for a 
parliamentary grant in respect to it. The London school board have 
determined to extend the work. 
Paris—In Paris, the infant schools (écoles maternelles) are more 
completely differentiated from the schools for older pupils than is the 
ease with the infant schools for London. 
We shall consider here only the work of the primary schools for chil-

dren of the compulsory ages, whith corresponds to the seven standards _ 
of the English schools. The division of the course into three grades, 
elementary, intermediate (moyen), and superior, is strictly observed in 
the Paris schools. The distribution of the pupils by grades in 1888 
was as follows :'

The classification of pupils by age and by the length of time which 
they have spent in the schools is interesting as indicating the general 
tendency to complete the entire course. It appears that in the schools ~ 
for boys, 5,712 pupils were from 6 to 7 years of age, as against 7,313 
from 12 to 13 years. The corresponding numbers in the schools for 
girls were 4,961 and 5,743.2 The falling off in pupils 13 and above is 
very marked. The length of time which each pupil had passed in the 
grade to which he belonged is shown in the following table?

The elementary course, including a preparatory class, which forms — 
the transition from the infant school to the methods and subjects of the — 
primary proper, is designed for three years, each of the higher courses 
for two years. ‘The number of pupils remaining more than three years 
in the elementary course and more than two in the intermediate, viz, 
13,179 (8,073 boys and 5,106 girls), as compared with the entire number 
in the superior course, viz, 18,013 (9,712 boys, 8,301 girls), shows that 
a very large proportion of the pupils pass their entire time in the two 
lower sections.

It is impossible here to follow the official report through the inter- 
esting exposition of this programme. With regard to manual training, 
in which Paris has given an important precedent for all countries, it 
should be observed that until 1886 time was found for this training out- 
side of the regular school hours, #. e., from 7 to 8:30 in the morning; 
from 4:30 to 5:45 in the evening, or on Thursday morning, the schools 
not being in session on that day. The subject is now included within 
the school.hours. Since 1881 workshops have been established in 100 
schools for boys, leaving 65 unprovided for.' 
The elementary school work of the two cities here considered differs 
widely in theory. The English conception of public responsibility in 
this matter is not only much more restricted than that of republican 
France, but the ideal of human development is narrower; nevertheless, 
in practice the schools of the two cities approach each other very closely. 
It may be said that the London schools are working out an ideal; 
the Paris schools are working up to an ideal. We can not here con- 
sider the many supplementary agencies by which the influence of the 
schools is intensified and their province extended; the competitive ex- 
ercises in singing and in drill, the intellectual contests, and the exhibi-- 
tions of drawing and of manual work, wliich excite the emulation of 
pupils and gr atity the e pride of parents. The effort of the schools to

+ ineuleate thrift and economy should not pass unnoticed. In the Lon- 
‘don schools free use is made of the post-office savings system. 
In the Paris schools, in 1888, savings banks (caisses Wépargne scolaires) 
had been established in 197 schools, and the deposits in the same had 
reached a total of $86,775. 
Results of instruction —The annual government-examination by Her 
Majesty’s inspectors, which prior to 1890 were conducted on the system 
of individual examination, afforded an index to the results of the work 
in the London schools. The percentage of passes in the three obliga- 
tory subjects was greater in 1889-90 than had ever before ‘been re- 
‘eorded for these schools, 97.3 per cent of the pupils having passed in 
reading, 92.4 per cent in ‘writing, 90.4 per cent in ‘arithmetic. In 
‘class subjects the percentage of departments earning the highest 
grant was also greater than for previous years, while the increased 
number of schools earning the highest rate of merit! grant showed an 
improvemént in the tone of the schools and the .general quality of the 
work. In his recent annual address the chairman of the board, con- 
trasting the present situation with 1871, says: 
“Notwithstanding the growth of the population in the interval, the 
number of juvenile offenders is only 3,872 in 1891,-as against'9,998 in 
1870. Of course the establishment in 1856 of industrial and reforma- 
tory schools has had much to do with this result; and it may be that 
many juvenile ‘offenders who are now subjected to the reforming in- 
fluence of industrial schools would at the earlier period have been 
- punished by prison discipline and perhaps have inevitably fallen into 
the ranks of criminals. But when fall weight has been given to these 
considerations a considerable margin of good still:remains, which may 
largely be attributed to the elevating influence of good public elemen- 
tary schools.” “* * * 
“Phere are evidences on all sides that the average culture of the 
community has been distinctly raised. ‘Good literature commands a 
more enlarged circle of readers, andl the spreafl of public libraries, still 
more the inexpensive -editions of standard works, are tokens-of ‘this 
wider taste.” 
The official statements of the government inspectors bear witness ‘to 
the high average of excellence in the Paris schools. This representa- 
tion is emphasized by the increasing proportion of pupils applying for, 
and passing successfully, the examination for the primary certificate 
(certificut W études). 
In the decade 1878 to 1888, the nuinber of candidates from séhools 
“for boys rose from 2,591 to.5,873, and the proportion of :passes from 
64.50 per cent to $0.98. The corresponding increase for girls was from 
‘4,853 to 4,427 candidates, and from 68.55 per cent to 78.35 passing suc-

cessfully.1. The rise has not been constant, but the maximum numbers 
were reached the last year of the period. Tho report which we have 
been following embodies also the results of a special investigation, 
which was carried through every arrondissement of Paris, for the pur- | 
pose of determining the actual condition and the general effect of the 
schools. This investigation bears out the favorable view already pre- 
sented. Among the subjects covered by the inquiry, we note particu- 
larly that respecting the occupations of parents and the interest mani- 
fested by them in the schools. From the statements regarding these : 
particulars it appears that the Paris schools are patronized by all classes 
of society, excepting the old nobility, and that a large proportion of 
parents are in sympathy with the schools.” 
The public schools of London and Paris operate as has been said, side 
by side with parochial and other private schools, the latter comprising 
in London a little less than one-third, in Paris somewhat more than one- 
third of the entire elementary school attendance. : 
In any comparative study of the systems of the two cities, it should 
not be forgotten that the board schools of London have no organic re- 
lation to higher institutions; the primary schools of Paris on the con- 
trary belong to one division of a comprehensive system whose crown 
is the University of Paris. 
From this brief summary it appears possibly that Paris with its cen- 
tralized system, has grappled somewhat more successfully than London 
with the problem of popular education. Thisinference would probably 
be strengthened by a more intimate knowledge of the infant schools 
and the higher primaries which have simply been touched upon. 
These last, five for boys, and one for girls, resemble our most ad- 
vanced English high schools which have large development in modern 
language and technical courses. To the higher primaries of Paris must- 
be added the collége chaptal, a municipal institution comprising elemen- 
tary and secondary courses, the latter both scientific and classical. 
Here the best theories of modern education are in practice upon a 
grand scale, the college affording ample accommodation for 1,200 
pupils, which is about the annual membership. This college and the 
higher primaries compete successfully with the lycées in the work of 
secondary instruction. London is notdestitute of institutions of second- 
ary and higher grade,’ but they do not form part of the system pro- 
vided for the masses. On the other hand the educational problem of 
London is much more complicated than that of Paris. The density of 
population, the mixture of nationalities in the poorest stratum, the con-

5A recent estimate gives the number of endowed secondary schools in London as 
37, and of proprietary schools for boys 10. In these about 15,000 boys are educated. 
About 20 per cent of their pupils are from the artisan class; the larger portion 80 
per cent from the middle class.

stant influx of emigrants have no parallelin the French capital. Under 
the English policy which leaves a large measure of liberty to localities 
and to individuals, the inertia of ignorance is not attacked by an ex- 
. ternal concentrated force, but yields, if at all, to an internal leaven. 
. The movement, if slower than in Paris, is more deeply inwrought into 
individual character. The triennial election of the school board is in 
itself a great educational agent, rousing every ratepayer to a sense of 
personal responsibility in school matters and familiarizing the people 
at large with questions of administrative policy and ideals and with 
practical methods in the work of human enlightenment.

CHAPTER Ix. 
EDUCATION IN GERMANY 
INTRODUCTION. 
The Annual Report of the Bureau of Education of 1888-89 offered a 
lengthy exposé of the public school system of Prussia, based on the 
ofiicial Prussian reports of 1887. Since the authorities of that Kingdom 
publish extensive statistics of public schools only at intervals of three 
years, a new statement concerning them coming from this Bureau 
would necessitate useless repetitions. There are, however, some fea- 
tures of education in Prussia not treated Hononeniy in the Report of 
1888-89, as, for instance, the middle and private schools in Prussia, 
and some trends that have developed of late. These subjects, together 
with a general statement of the educational facilities of the Kingdom 
of Saxony, are offered this year in lieu of a comparative statement of 
the Prussian schools. This Bureau is as yet unable to publish a com- 
prehensive view of the Bavarian school system, for notwithstanding 
its endeavors to obtain official statistics from that country, it has not 
succeeded in gaining a comprehensive view of the entire system. 
I.—MIDDLE SCHOOLS IN PRUSSIA. 
{Sources of Information: (1) Preussische Schulstat istik, vol. 101. (2) Pedagogium, vol. 1890-91.) 
Though the management of schools on the part of the state in Prus- 
sia is much more centralized than in the United States, the Kingdom 
has a great variety of public schools which do not supplement one an- 
other as primary, grammar, and high schools do in our country. The 
different classes of society have schools that exist independent of and 
in no organie connection with one another. Though many German 
educators urge a nationalization of the schools—that is, a reorganization 
which would give rise toacommon school system, embracing primary and 
middle or secondary schools all in one organization—as yet the tendency 
of both the majority of the people and of the government is opposed to 
this. The much discussed “ Hinheitsschule” (common or union school) 
has no hope of immediate BE any more than had, during Mini

ter Falk’s administration, the efforts in favor of the “Simultanschule” 
(a fusion of Catholic and Protestant schools). 
Individuality is a strong characteristic of the Germans, hence class 
distinctions call for the maintenance of separate kinds of schools, all of 
which admit their pupils at six years of age. But while the “Volks- 
schule” has the great bulk of school-going’ population (86.3 per cent), 
other schools, the middle and high schools, have also a considerable por- 
tion of that population, as will be seen from the following summary : 
Per cent.

Middle schools (in 1887). 402,950 or 7.1 
Secondary schools (in 1887) - 353,243 or =6.2 
Normal schools and universities (in 1887) 22,954 or 0.4    
    A not inconsiderable portion of the population in Prussia desires 
and aims ata higher education than is offered in the public elementary 
or people’s schools. This desire has led in various portions of the 
state, noticeably in cities, to the establishment of institutions bearing 
such names as “Biirgerschulen” (citizens’ schools), “Mittelschulen” 
(middle schools), “‘Rectoratsschulen” (rector schools), ‘‘ Héhere Kna- 
benschulen” (higher schools for boys), or Stadtschulen (city schools, in 
contradistinction to people’s schools), and not only serving the object 
mentioned, butin addition to that paying some regard to the conditions 
of industrial life among the so-called middle class of society. 
‘The foregoing has reference to the boys. To the girls all secondary 
institutions of learning, such as gymnasia, etc., are closed. The Ger- 
man government debars the female sex from the universities, and ad- 
mits only boys to all schools that lead up to the university. <A great 
number of separate schools for girls was needed to meet the demand 
for a higher grade of education than the elementary schools could offer. 
These middle or advanced schools for girls are generally called “‘Héhere 
Madchensehulen” (higher schools for girls), if not named after some 
philanthropist who founded or endowed them; thus a few are called 
after famous queens and empresses, such as Queen Louise, Empress 
Augusta, and Empress Victoria. 
In a chart contained in the last Report of this Bureau (see page 178) 
these two groups of middle schools are represented in the statistical 
summary only. Perfeet accuracy could not be claimed. We are able | 
this year to give a more detailed statement. 
The courses of study of these institutions, both for boys and girls, 
have generally developed without the state’s interference. A greater 
variety in objects andin means toattaimthese objects was possible, since 
previous to the decree commonly known as the general regulations of 
- 1872 (Minister Falk) no regulations or prescriptions for their adminis- 
tration had been issued. Even to-day a tabular summary illustrating 
the objects of these institutions would be a vain endeavor. The regu- 
lations mentioned (those of 1872) offer some suggestions for the estab-
-P-A-G-E-311

lishment and characteristics of these schools. According to these 
regulations instruction in middle schools should not be as extended as 
that of the public high schools, nor should it be a continuation of the 
grammar school, but be parallel with instruction in the public schools, 
and only in higher grades go beyond the aims of the latter. The mid- 
die school (to use a convenient generic term) was required to have at 
least five ascending grades, with a maximum number of 50 pupils in 
each. The regulations also provided that if the establishment of mid- 
dle schools was impracticable in any community, the elementary school 
(Volksschule) might in the upper grades go beyond the course laid down 
for it, so as to act as a makeshift until better circumstances would 
justify the establishment of a separate middleschool. In places where 
fully graded elementary schools prepare the way for middle schools, 
these latter are confined to two or three grades only, but a separation 
of the sexes is required. Furthermore, it was permitted to incorporate - 
the higher grades of elementary schools in the middle schools; that is 
to say, to divide a public elementary school into an elementary and a 
middle school department; but it was expressly emphasized that the - 
elementary school course should be completed by all the children who 
do not intend to enter the middle schools. However, such hybrid in- 
stitutions are rare. The dense population of Prussia generally enables 
the cities to maintain middle schools independent of elementary schools, 
which middle schools admit their pupils at six years and keep them 
till they reach the seventeenth year. 
Course of study.—The “ General Regulations” (1872) give a model 
course of study for middle schools calculated to cover six grades, but 
do not require a strict adherence to it. Wherever local circumstances 
make desirable due regard for agriculture, manufacturing, mining, com- 
merce, and navigation, changes may be made in the course to meet 
these circumstances. A few things in the regulations, however, are 
mandatory, as for instance, in every middle school the teaching of 
one modern language is obligatory; but only in full middle schools 
(that is, such as are not in connection with the people’s schools) may two 
modern languages be made obligatory. Pupils who are to be prepared. 
for the higher grades of secondary schools (being prevented by too 
great a distance from attending the latter) may take up Latin as an 
optional study. ; 
Concerning the study of French or English the model course of study 
contains the following: “The aim is a proper pronunciation and good 
spelling of the foreign language, as well as the ability to read easy 
prose writings without the use of the dictionary; to compose simple 
business letters, and to converse in that language within the limits of 
common conversation, In schools with more than six grades the ability 
to understand the selected works of some poets, as well as some ac- 
quaintance with the literature of the foreign language studied, is 
         
-P-A-G-E-312
    284 EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
required.” it goes without saying that both in conversation and 
_ composition more is expected here than in schools of only six grades. 
In schools of six grades the course requires that the foreign lan- 
guage begin with the fourth year of the school. At first an elementary 
book and a reader are to be used, afterward a grammar, and in the high- 
est grade selected prose pieces and poems for reading. If the school

Grading.—The latest statistics published concerning the public 
middle schools of Prussia (both boys’ and girls’ schools) enable us to 
offer a better statement than was possible hitherto. 
The public middle schools for boys and those for girls are mostly 
found in cities, rarely in the country. In 1887, Prussia had— 
| In the | coun- | Total. | try.     
Middle schools -   
       41 576 “Number of class 107 |» 4,158 Number of classe 109} 8,818 Boys’ 53 | 1,280 Gitls’ 9| 2,280 Mixed 4 258 
    
From these figures it is obvious that most of the middle schools in 
the country are embryonic, and have not developed beyond a mere be- 
ginning. The number of classes is small, and in nearly one-half of them 
boys and girls are taught together. ' 
(NorE.—It is the generally accepted rule in Germany to separate the 
sexes in all schools that are not specifically people’s or elementary 
schools.) Even in cities are found a good many middle schools that
-P-A-G-E-313

have not proceeded in their organization beyond the lowest grades, a 
fact which the following summary will illustrate:

Thirty-seven country and 190 city middle schools and girls’ higher 
schools had less than five ascending grades. Hence, it may be con- 
cluded that many of these schools, though elaiming the distinction of 
being middle schools, are scarcely entitled to it, and are, properly 
speaking, nothing but elementary schools. Five and more ascending 
grades were found in 349 schools, or about 60 per cent of all the middle 
schools. The provinces of Prussia, taken separately, have middle 
schools as follow

          Pupils. 9 the 576 middle schools of Prussia had 134,937 pupils. 
This is a remarkably low number, particularly if we consider that of — 
this total number 81,913 are girls, and only 53,024 boys. If, however, 
the fact is considered that the boys in Germany usually attend second- 
ary schools where girls are not admitted, we see that these middle 
schools are really the girls’ secondary schools. In the year 1887 the 
gymnasia, realschulen, realgymnasia, ete., had 151,541 pupils, all boys. 
Now, if to that number we add the number of boys in middle schools, 
to wit, 53,024, and furthermore, 12,625 boys of private institutions of 
like character, we find the total number of boys who attempt to acquire 
an education beyond that which the elementary school offers, to be 
217,190. In other words, of all the boys who receive a higher education 
Sia the elementary schools offer, 30 per cent are found in middle ge 
70 per cent in secondary schools. 
Adding to the number of girls in public middle schools, namely, 
81,913, the number of those who are found in private institutions of 
like character, namely, 55,748, we find the sum total of female pupils 
who aim at more than an elementary education, to be 137,661, Com- 
paring the two totals we find the boys in the lead; a state of affairs

Hence it would seem that in 1837 there were 79,529 more boys than 
girls who aim at a higher grade of education than a simple elementary 
school offers. In reality however, the difference is not quite so great 
as the foregoing figures indicase, since thousands of Prussian girls are 
taught by private goyernesses, or attend private finishing schools in 
Switzerland, England and other countries. And the other fact, to wit, 
that the boys’ high schools, the gymnasia, etc., keep their students 
till they arve.20 years of :age, tends to show that the aforementioned 
difference between the number of boys and girls is notas large as the 
tables indicate; about 10,000 to 12,000 boys of over 18 years of age are 
stillin school preparing themselves for the universities when the girls 
have left school. But, however we may try te explain away the dis- 
erepancy, the fact remains that the state pays mere attention to the 
secondary education of boys than to that of girls, and for superior 
education of girls in universities the state dees nothing at all. 
Another remarkable thing is noticed when we:compare the unequal 
use made of these schools by the diferent religious denominations. 
The following table is instructive:

This table shows that the Catholic population does not make use of 
the middle schools in the same proportion in which Protestants and 
Jews do. A similar fact may be observed when scanning the statis- 
tics ofhigh schools. In 1887 there were 72.5 per cent Protestants,'17.6 
per cent Catholics, 0.25 per cent other Christians, and 9.1 per cent Jews, 
and in the universities the proportion of students was 67.94 per cent 
Protestants, 20.12 per cent Catholics, 0.36 per cent other Christians, and 
9.58 per cent Jews. So the discrepancy in the number of Catholics in 
middle schools is not an isolated case. It is only marked more promi- 
nently than in the higher and highest seats of learning. Everywhere, in
-P-A-G-E-315
  EDUCATION IN GERMANY. 287 
middle and secondary schools, and in universities, the participation of the 
Catholic population is comparatively smaller than that of the Protes- 
tant and Jewish population. The cause of this is not so much because 
Catholics undervalue intellectual eulture, as in the fact that the ma- 
jority of the Catholic population do not live in cities where higher 
seats of learning are established, but in the country and in villages. 
The Protestants and Jews, having easy access to middle and high 
schools, frequent them to a greater degree than the Catholics. Among 
“the farmers and small landowners are comparatively more Catholics; 
the agricultural people of Prussia are generally poorer than the city — 
people. 
‘Though these explanations seem plausible, they do not remove the 
fact that the Protestant and Jewish populations in Prussia far surpass. 
the Catholic population in their respective numbers of students of mid- 
dle and higher schools. The truest test would be to compare the ratio 
of Catholic, Protestant, and Jewish children in the lower or elementary 
schools with the ratio of Catholic, Protestant, and Jewish population, if - 
it were left to the free will of all to choose whether to make use of these 
schools or not. But the state compels all children between 6 and 14 
years to attend school, hence that test is out of the question. 
Teachers.—Concerning the number of teachers in middle schools, offi- 
cial statistics give the following summary: 
| 
    
     
  Teachers. Men. |Women.| Total. 
Protestants 2, 987 1,031 4,018 
Ca i 373 113 486 
2 1 3 
70 12 | 82 
3402 | ae) 4, 589 
From this it is seen that about 25 per cent of all the teachers in pub- 
lic middle schools are women, hence that women hold positions in these 
schools more frequently than in the lower, the purely elementary, 
schools of the kingdom. The greatest ratio of women teachers in Prussia 
is found in private middle schools, where 2,422 of 3,126 (or nearly 80 
per cent) are women. That women should be employed more fre. 
quently in middle schools than in any other grade of schools is owing 
to the fact mentioned before, that the middle schools are virtually the 
secondary schools of the girls, others being closed to them; farther- 
more that the proprietors of private higher schools for girls resert to 
women teachers because they work for lower salaries than men. In ali 
the public schools of Prussia (elementary, middle, and secondary) only 
10,600 women teachers were employed, or 144 per cent of all the teach- 
ers in the kingdom. . 
In the middle schools the number of pupils per teacher was 33.6 in 
1887, 
   
-P-A-G-E-316

The total expenditure of public middle schools was $2,701,807 in the 
same year, of which sum $923,047 were required for the erection of build- 
ings and for rent and incidental expenses. The communities paid 85,29 
per cent of this sum, the state only 1.39 per cent of the remainder; 12.32: 
per cent was raised by tuition fees. The salaries amounted to $1,778,760, 
which sum was obtained from tuition fees (69.28 per cent), communal 
taxes (25.73 per cent), state appropriations (3.16 per cent), and interest 
on irreducible funds (1.82 per cent). The foregoing sum total paid for 
salaries includes these two items: Pensions to teachers, $62,870, and 
contributions to widows’ and orphans’ fund, $9,386.

The majority of male teachers have an income of over $450; the ma- 
jority of women an income of over $300. 
One hundred and forty-four male teachers were on the pension roll, 
that is one for every 42 men in active service; 103 female teachers 
were living on a pension, or one for every 9 in active service. The ay- 
erage pension of men was $354, that of women $118 per annum. The 
current expenditures (for salaries) amounted to $466 per class, which 
was $13.18 per pupil. The entire expenditure (including erection of 
buildings and rent) was $708 per class, or $20 per pupil. Since the 
tuition fee was $9 per annum state and communities had to pay $11 
per child. In order to better comprehend this statement it may be 
added that the per capita in secondary schools (that lead up to the 
university) was $45 in the same year, which necessitated an expendi- 
ture on the part of the state and communities of $26 per capita,

II.—PRIVATE SCHOOLS IN: PRUSSIA. 
[Sources of information.—(1) Preussische Schul Statistik, Vol. 101. (2) Paedagogium, Vol. 1890-91.] 
Before the public schools of the Kingdom had the care and close su- : 
pervision on the part of the state which they have now, many more 
private schools were in existence than at present. During the last 25 
years the private schools have not increased in numbers, but percepti- 
bly decreased. The following tables will show this:

These numbers comprise all the private schools of elementary and 
middle (or lower secondary) grade. 
This retrogression of the Prussian private schools since 1871 is ex- 
plained by the statement that communities which formerly supported 
them, while leaving their management in private hands, have all 
changed them to public schools. The existence of other private schools 
is made impossible by the progress the public schools are making 
under the care of supervisors who are abreast with the times. Only 
‘where a private school has a renowned educator at its head who makes 
his institution an experimental station for new ideas, theories, and 
methods, does it find ample support. 
  In 1871 the average number of classes in the private schools was , 
2.39, with 57.3 pupils in all; in 1886 the average number of classes was 
3.13, with 63,8 pupils in all. While the number of schools decreased 
from 1,409 to 888 (respectively from 1,868 to 1,209), the number of classes          
in each school increased. In Berlin alone the number of pupils in 
private schools, between 1882 and 1888, decreased from 21,520 to 19,577, 
while during the same period the pried of pupils in able schools 
increased from 138,294 to 186,027. 
In both city and country private schools the retrogr: ade movement 
from 1871 till 1886 is noticeable, but from obvious reasons more so in 
cities than in the country. Compare the following table:

A.—PrIVATE ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS. 
In Prussia, the purely elementary private school has scarcely any 
importance, either in numbers or in influence. ¢ In 1887 there were—

-If we compare this total with the number of pupils in public ele- 
mentary schools (4,883,110), it appears very insignificant, about two- 
thousandths of one per cent. 
The average number of pupils in these private elementary schools 
was 37.5 in cities and 32 in the country. The largest school of this 
kind is found in the governmental district of Diisseldorf; it has 1,266 
pupils; two are found in Berlin with 351 and 758. pupils; most of the 
others are very small. Among 248 private elementary schools 190 had 
only one class room with less than 30 pupils.

The attendance in these schools is considered regular. Only 18 
classes are overcrowded, having 1,470 pupils (81.7 average), while 276 
classes have 3,337 pupils (average 14). 
The separation of the sexes is carried out in 183 of 363 classes, so 
that 2,047 boys and 2,977 girls are taught separately. In 185 classes 
the two sexes were taught together; these classes have 1,646 boys and 
2,093 girls. The private elementary schools have altogether3,693 boys 
and 5,070 girls. 
Among the 8,763 pupils only 173 were from families in which Ger- 
man is not the mother tongue. The religious denominations were rep-

Besides the 333 teachers (129 men and 204 women) employed full — 
time, 113 assistants, or special teachers, chiefly music, drawing, gym- 
nasties, and manual-training teachers, were employed. 
B.—PRIVATE MIDDLE SCHOOLS. 
The private secondary or middle schools are, to this day, as they used 
to be in the past, a valuable part of the Prussian educational system. 
Tn regard to numbers they surpass the public. middle schools, but do 
not reach their extent; that is, as a rule are not as large. While 576 
public middle schools had 134,937 pupils, 961 private schools of this 
kind had only 68,373 pupils, which is on an average 71 pupils per school. 
The private middle schools have 3,415 classes, or 3.55 per school, and 
each class about 20 pupils. 
The following table shows in what proportion cities and the country 
_ participate in maintaining private middle schools:

Hence the cities have 92.2 per cent, the country having only 7.8 per 
cent of the sum total of pupils.

The fact that there are middle schools with less than three grades 
requires the explanation that they are schools accepting pupils only 
after they have acquired a certain advanced grade of education, so-called 
finishing schools; they are still in their infancy, expecting to build up 
higher grades as their pupils advance in sufficient numbers. 
The private middle schools are chiefly used as girls’ secondary schools, 
since among 68,373 children attending them there are 55,748 girls and 
only 12,625 boys, and most of the latter are sent to these schools only 
temporarily at a tender age. This is seen from the fact that 3,016 boys 
and 3,030 girls are taught together in mixed classes.

  The private schools in Prussia, notwithstanding their decrease in 
numbers, exercise still an important influence upon public life. They 
offer to a great number of women teachers a modest income, which 
is a fact not to be underrated in a country so overcrowded as Prussia 
is. While the public elementary and middle schools had, during the 
same year (1887), among 58,765 full-time teachers only 7,869 (or about 
_ 11 per cent) women, the private schools had, among 3,459 teachers, 
2,616 (or 77 per cent) women. 
The authorities of public schools, especially in the country and more 
especially still in Protestant countries, seem to be averse to the em- 
ployment of women, which is seen from the fact that in all the country 
schools of the kingdom only 442 Protestant women are employed as
-P-A-G-E-321
    EDUCATION IN GERMANY. 293 
teachers, while 2,304 Catholic women teachers are found in country 
schools. 
Hence, the private school has a mission to perform, first, in showing 
that women can compete with men in the province of education, and, 
secondly, in opening up opportunities for women in the battle for sus- 
tenance, which is increasing in severity every year in the Old World. 
III.—GERMAN CITIES AND PUBLIC PLAY, 
[From the educational press of Germany.] 
Observant people have become aware, during late years, of the ravages 
eaused in our physical natures by excessive mental exertion in school 
and life, by living closely together in cities and especially in tene- 
ment houses, by the frequently antihygienic conditions of factories 
and workshops, and also by the many habits arising from our high de- 
gree of intellectual culture. Under these antihygienic influences the 
individual suffers loss of labor, health, energy, and joy in life. While 
it is true that moral resistance may decrease these evil influences which 
no one can quite escape, it is also undeniable that an increase of im- 
moral monstrosities can be directly traced to them. 
The nations of the Old World are awakening to the consciousness of 
the chain of cause and effect in this matter, and in Germany more than 
in other. civilized countries a reaction is taking place which may prove 
most beneficial in the future. Many measures of recent date instituted 
by the State, communities, schools, and societies are eloquent witnesses 
of this reaction. But, however much has been done to ward off anti- 
hygienic influences and to improve the health of all, it does not seem 
to keep step with the influences steadily at work in vitiating and de- 
teriorating health. 
One remedy has not been applied as yet in Germany, and that is con- 
stant physical training in youth by means of suitable exercises and ex- 
hilarating motion, and this, perhaps in moderate form, continued all 
through life. What has been done hitherto is quite insufficient. 
Gymnastic exercises in school, for instance twice a week, are not 
enough to counteract deteriorating influences upon health. Neither 
are students of secondary schools and universities accustomed to ex- 
ercise their bodies sufficiently, as Minister von Gossler has shown by 
statistics. Young men belonging to the commercial and industrial 
classes, as well as tradespeople and artisans, do still less in this direc- 
tion. Societies for athletic sport are rare and have only few members. 
What individuals do in the way of physical culture is not of much 
influence upon the great mass of the people. Observant people ask, 
what shall be done? 
Of course a beginning is to be made in childhood andyouth. Physical 
strength must be brought to a greater development in school than has 
has been done hitherto. In order that this influence may continue after 
the child has left school it is necessary to awaken a pleasure in phys- 
ical exercises and movements. «Nothing in this world is done well unless 
 
-P-A-G-E-322
          294 EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
it be attended with pleasure. This pleasure is found in “applied 
-gymnastiés,” in play. Play awakens not only a feeling of happiness, 
as Herbert Spencer says, but it is also the strongest means for invig- 
orating the nervous and muscular system. It is also an essential 
factor for the promotion of morality; hence it is desirable, and indeed 
peremptorily necessary, for young men and women to continue bodily 
exercises, particularly play, after they have left school. Everything 
in this respect depends upon habit. There are some indications of the 
fact that outdoor play begins to develop into a national custom. Even 
people who do not participate therein sympathize heartily with the 
movement. 
Tt is well known that in England, and to a great extent also in the 
United States, outdoor play is practiced by young and middle-aged 
persons. A vivid description in German of the customs in England 
concerning play has been furnished to the general reading public by 
Mr. Raydt, a school principal in Ratzeburg, in a book which has met 
with great approval. It is entitled “A Sound Mind in a Sound Body.” ° 
In Germany also the number of cities and villages in which outdoor play 
is encouraged by authorities and the press is increasing. However, “if 
two do the same thing it is not the same,” that is to say, German insti- 
tutions will forever be essentially German. It is impossible to. intro- 
duce into German society such national plays as baseball and football. 
Publie play, if it is to be successfully introduced, must consider the 
peculiarities, characteristics, and idiosyncrasies of the people. To 
study these characteristics, ete., to receive suggestions with regard to 
them, is the present endeavor of the persons interested. As in every- 
thing else, the Germans proceed methodically and with thoroughness. 
The promoters of this movement are well aware that it will not do to 
imitate other nations without due regard to proper adaptation. 
During the spring of 1890 a committee was formed in Gérlitz in 
answer to a call from Mr. von Schenkendorf, member of the Prussian 
Diet, who gave expression to the general conviction. The committee 
addressed the mayors of all the German cities of over 8,000 inhabitants, 
asking them to state first what had been done in reference to the pro- 
motion of public play; second, what suggestions could be made for its 
immediate introduction. The officials of 273 cities replied, stating the 
local conditions and giving’a description of the playgrounds. ATI ex 
pressed warm sympathy with the cause, and this inquiry alone sufficed 
to induce them to immediate action. 
Perhaps the most tangible result the circular letter of the committee 
has had is the fact that in several cities philanthropic men have estab- 
lished public playgrounds, furnished them with the most approved imple- 
ments and apparatus for play, such as swings and gymnastic apparatus, 
and endowed the institutions with a sum of money sufficient to defray 
the annual expenses for proper supervision and care. Public-school 
~ teachers are generally appointed supervisors of playgrounds which are

open after school hours. At other points the city authorities have set 
aside shady portions in city parks for playgrounds, and every zodlog- 
ical garden known in Germany is provided with a well-stocked play- 
ground for children. 
The material gathered by the committee has been worked up, sifted, 
classified, and enlarged upon in a book by Mr. Raydt, entitled “Ger- 
man Cities and Public Play.” The author and compiler is filled with 
great enthusiasm and has evidently studied educational questions and 
the bearings of physical culture. The’work contains eight chapters; 
it begins with a statement of the value of play and bodily exercises, 
then gives an historic review of the development of play as far as his- 
torically known. The author also discusses the institutions of 34 cities 
where public play is encouraged and promoted by the city authorities, 
The replies received by the committee are either summarized or given 
in full. Manual training receives a good share of attention as a means 
of promoting hygienie conditions. In a concluding chapter, a number 
of warnings and suggestions are offered which deserve consideration. 
In order to make the work of the committee more practical still, a list 
and description of apparatus and implements is inserted with a state- 
ment of prices and sources of manufacture. 
On May 21, 1891, the central committee for the promotion of juvenile 
and popular play in Berlin issued a cireular soliciting means, sugges-_ 
tions, and advice. 
IV.—EDUCATION OF NEGLECTED AND DEPRAVED CHILDREN IN 
PRUSSIA. 
The Diet in Prussia on October 1, 1878, passed a law concerning com- 
pulsory education of neglected and depraved children which received 
the sanction of the crown. From the date of the passage of the law up 
to April 1, 1890, there were placed in “reform asylums or schools” 16,964 
children. Of these 654 were discharged on condition, 4,559 uncondi- 
tionally, 439 died, 447 escaped or were stricken from the roll for other 
reasons (not stated), so that on April 1, 1890, there remained 10,865 under 
surveillance. Of these 5,754 had been placed in families, 9 in State 
prisons, 982 in provincial and 4,120 in private reform asylums. The 
expenses for the entire number amounted to $352,610 for the year 
1889-90, which were borne by the state and the provinces in equal 
shares. The total expenses since the passage of the law, that is for 
twenty years, amounted to $2,937,817. During the year 1889-90, 1,615 
children were added, which is an increase of 103 per cent. The follow- 
ing table is given to show to what extent the different provinces partic- 
ipate in this “forced education.”

  V.—JUVENILE WAGE-WORKERS IN PRUSSIA. 
The last annual report of the Prussian councilors of industry offers 
in tabular form a statement concerning the statistics of juvenile wage: 
workers of the year 1890. For many years the state did not consider 
it necessary to regulate juvenile labor by legal enactments, chiefly be- 
cause the requirements and rigid enforcement of the compulsory school- 
attendance act made special laws against abuse of juvenile labor 
unnecessary. Since the compulsory-attendance law left much to the 
discretion of the supervisory authorities, who could adjust individual 
cases, the act had a stimulating effect upon the attendance at school, 
and at the same time checked abuse in utilizing the children for the 
purpose of earning money. 
Only recently, or during the last ten years, that is, since the require- 
ments of life in Germany have become so difficult to meet that poor 
families are obliged to call into play all the labor-power at their dis- 
posal, has it been found imperative to protect the growing generation 
by means of strict laws from excessive demands upon their bodily and 
mental strength. Still, considering that the supervisory authorities 
have always had a margin of discretionary power with reference to 
children from 12 to 14 years, the recent laws are by no means as 
specific as the English laws. Children of that age in many cases were 
excused from attending school half the time, and even for an entire 
year if the poverty of the parents was so great that it was a question 
of the family becoming a public charge. 
Of course, there are good reasons why factory-owners should desire 
juvenile labor in preference to the labor of adults. Children work for 
very low wages and their fingers are more skilful for certain things 
than men’s fingers. The same reason which opened the factories for 
women opened them for children. Competition which has become so 
fierce of late may be the life of trade, but it surely is the death of the 
growing generation. Of late the economic conditions of many localities 
in Germany (chiefly in the western portion of Prussia and in the king- 
   
-P-A-G-E-325
EDUCATION IN| GERMANY. 4 297. 
dom of Saxony) have become worse and worse, and poverty seems to 
grow at a great rate in industrial centers. These considerations have 
induced the authorities to investigate the subject of juvenile labor and 
to gather statistics upon which to base legislative action. ‘The enact- 
ment passed in 1889 provides that no children under 13 years of age 
may be employed in factories and limits the number of hours of labor 
per day. : , 
According to the statistics at hand there were in Prussia 19,275 fac- 
tories in which juveniles were employed in 1890, which-is an increase 
of 2,771 over 1888. The greatest number of factories employing juve- 
nile laborers were those in which articles of food and drink are manu- 
factured or prepared, to wit, 3,332; then follow the stone and clay 
industry, with 2,682 factories, and the textile industry, with 2,577. 
The entire number of wage-earning juvenile laborers (between 12 and 
16) working in factories in 1890 was 125,904 (an increase ‘of 21,665 over 
1888). While, according to the number of factories employing children, 
the textile industry is the third, that industry really takes the first 
place if the number of juveniles is considered, which is 26,572; the 
second kind of industry employing juveniles is the mining industry 
and iron and salt works, which employ 20,845 juveniles; there were 
also 16,620 metal-workers, and the factories in which articles of food 
and drink are manufactured or prepared had 13,442 juvenile laborers, 
while the stone and clay industry employed 12,807. 
Among the 125,904 young people were 88,452 boys and 37,452 girls, 
The girls outnumbered the boys in the textile industry, with 15,648 
against 10,924; also in the clothing and cleaning branch, with 2,641 to 
1,140; while in the paper and leather industry the two sexes are about 
equally represented, 3,196 girls and 3,197 boys. 
As was the case with the entire number of juvenile laborers (between 
the ages of 12 and 16), so the number of children (between the ages 
of 12 and-14) increased during the two years from 1888 to 1890 from 
6,225 to 6,633. Children were most frequently employed in factories in 
which articles of food and drink are prepared, namely, 2,585; in the 
textile industry we find 1,079 children; in the stone and clay industry, 
817; in mining, iron, and salt works, 408. As to sex, we find 4,209 
boys and 27424 girls among the factory children. 
Several of the reports mentioned above emphasize the fact that the in- 
crease in the employment of juvenile laborers was in accordance with 
the increase in the total number of laborers previous to 1889, but that 
in 1889 and 1890 the increase in the number of young laborers exceeded 
the former ratio. This is owing to the industrial progress made during 
these two years and the consequent founding of new factories and open- 
ing of new branches of manufacture. But since the number of chil- 
dren in factories has not increased it is to be presumed that more 
young people between 14 and 16 years are engaged. In some places, 
notably in Berlin and vicinity, and in Frankfort on the Oder, a nota- 
 
-P-A-G-E-326
              298 — EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
ple decrease in the number of wage-earning children has ose found, 
owing to the new “labor-protection law” which prohibits the employ- 
ment of children before they are 13 years old and permits that of 
children between 13 and 14 years only when they have completed thelr 
eommon-school course or haye a permit from the supervisory authorities. 
In the mining industry and in iron and salt works the ratio of in- 
crease of young laborers (14 to 16 years) is greater than the ratio of 
increase in the total number of laborers. While the latter was 7.8 per 
cent, that of the former was 13 per cent. In the mining district of 
Breslau (province of Silesia) the ratio of increase of young laborers 
was 38.6 per cent, while the whole number of laborers increased only 
9.7 per cent. In the western districts, in Dortmund (province ef Rhen- 
ish Prussia), for instance, the two ratios were 10.4 per cent and 10 per 
cent, j 
The occupations of these young laborers were in all cases light and 
suitable to their physical strength: The official reports state that the 
hygienic conditions of juvenile wage-workers show decided improve- 
ment and that the letter and spirit of the law-are universally observed. 
While this factory labor is accounted for in a manner satisfactory to 
the law and State authorities, there is another phase of the question of 
children employed as wage-workers which the law does not touch; it 
is the employment of children after school hours. A few striking 
though isolated cases which may shed light on the subject, have come 
to the notice of the press. 
To what extent children are obliged to aid their parents in making a 
living in Germany may be seen from the following figures: The Leipz. 
Zeitung says: “A school principal in Altendorf, near Chemnitz, in 
Saxony, made minute inquiries among his 468 pupils and found that of 
238 boys 69 (33.6 per cent) and of 230. girls 44 (19.8 per cent) were 
engaged after school hours in some occupation for which they received 
wages, 19 as messengers, 56 in factories, 11 in agriculture, 20 as domes- 
tic servants, and 7 in stores. The average number of hours ef work 
was 6 and the average wages per week 1.14 marks (27: cents), The ag- 
gregate wages per year amounted to 6,696 marks ($1,594). In the upper 
- grade of the school not less than 61.2 per cent of the pupils worked 
for wages after school hours; in the second grade, 44.9 per cent.” These 
statisties leave entirely out of consideration work performed at: home. 
Ifthat were counted in, the result in figures would be startling, since. 
most of the parents of the pupils in the lower schools in Saxony are 
small mechanics or tradesmen who depend upon the services of their 
children to keep the wolf from the decor, 
“Recent statistical publications notice that out of 32,512 boys en- 
rolled in the schools of Hamburg, 3,546 were engaged in occupations 
outside of their home after school hours from 2 to 6 hours a day, while 
647 were busy in some occupation at home from 6 to 11 hours. Out 
of 32,310 girls, 1,515 were engaged outside of their home up to 6 hours
-P-A-G-E-327
    {

and 500 at home up to5 hours. These are frightful facts and give 
evidence of much poverty and misery. Think of a boy who works 
for wages 11 hours and attends school 6 hours. That leaves him 7 
hours for recreation and sleep, day after day.” 
These facts show the thrift of the German laboring classes, it is true, 
and may be caused by fierce competition, but no nation, not even the 
phlegmatie, sturdy German, can stand the constant undermining of 
physical strength which must inevitably result from this early employ- 
ment of children as wage-workers.

INTRODUCTION, 
Saxony has not, like other countries, published comprehensive annual 
statistics of its schools, chiefly because the educational institutions of 
the Kingdom belong to the administration of different governmental 
departments, such as agriculture, education and religion, public works, 
ete. 
Not until the year 1890 did the Official Statistical Bureau publish _ 
the statistics of schools. This first attempt at showing comprehen- 
sively what Saxony does in educational matters is exceedingly inter- 
esting, pointing out, as it does, that no other country in Germany has 
such a multiplicity of educational institutions or has progressed farther 
than Saxony, which in area is not quite as large as the States of Con- 
necticut and Rhode Island, the latter-named States having 6,240 while 
Saxony has 5,856 square miles. 
SUPERIOR INSTITUTIONS. 
According to the official report mentioned, Saxony had on December 
2, 1889, five institutions for superior instruction, namely, the Univer- 
sity at Leipzig, the Polytechnicum at Dresden, the Veterinary High School 
at Dresden, the Mining Academy at Freiberg, and the Porestry Academy 
at Tharandt. These five institutions are classed among the universities. 
They had 2,417 students and 272 professors, ordinary, extraordinary, 
and special. The total expenditures amounted to 2,219,332 marks 
($554,833), of which sum the state contributed 1,562,111 marks ($390,- 
528), 70.5 per cent. ee 
SECONDARY INSTITUTIONS. 
_ The Kingdom had, in 1889, 58 secondary schools for the parpose of 
general culture and preparation for superior institutions. These schoois 
 
-P-A-G-E-328

had 958 teachers and 14,439 pupils. These secondary schools may be 
classed as follows: ay 
           
    “Gymnasia” (classical high schools)... AT 
“Realschulen” (modern high schools) fot 
“Realgymnasia” (schools that attempt to be both gymn and realschulen).../ 10 °

A comparison with former statistics shows that the number of gym- 
nasia has steadily increased, while the number of realgymnasia has 
decreased; naturally the attendance of pupils decreased accordingly. 
During the last year, however, this hybrid form again increased, both 
in number and attendance. 
Regarding the number of graduates of gymnasia of and realgymnasia 
it may be stated that the latter class has very materially decreased, 
owing to the fact that the diploma of a realgymnasium offers smaller priv- 
ileges in comparison with the diploma of a gymnasium. The graduates 
of gymnasia have by far better chances, both in professional and other 
occupations, hence the result. 
The gymnasia, on the other hand, have a greater number of grad- 
uates than ever before, so that the total number of graduates not only 
has not decreased, but has increased. The total expenditures for gym- 
nasia, realschulen, and realgymnasia were—

is greater than the increase of the share of the expenditures which was 
borne by the communities. The ratio of increase of the total expendi- 
tures from 1876 to 1888 was 42.5 per cent, while that of the state is 
62 per cent. 
The normal schools in Saxony are classed among the institutions for 
secondary instruction, although they are purely professional. Saxony 
had, in 1889, 19 normal schools, with 2,475 pupils, of whom 1,916 lived 
in dormitories attached to the school. The number of teachers and 
professors was 267, of whom only 10 were special teachers. Compar- 
ing the numbers with those of the year 1884, we find an increase in the 
number of students, owing, no doubt, to the increased demand for 
teachers in the elementary schools. In 1889 the number of students 
was 157 larger than in 1884, While this would seem to indicate a 
healthy state of affairs, another fact proves the contrary, namely, the 
 
-P-A-G-E-329
    EDUCATION. IN GERMANY.. ~ 3801 
great decrease in the number of candidates for positions in the lower 
schools. This is attributed to the fact that, while prices of commodities 
as well as other things contributing to comfort and luxury have greatly - 
increased during the latter years all over Germany, the salaries have 
remained stationary. The sum total of expenditures for normal schools 
was 1,124,646 marks ($281,162), of which the state paid 1,037,862: 
marks ($259,466). 
Besides these normal schools, Saxony has a special normal school for 
gymnastic teachers. In 1889 it had 12 students, all of whom were 
teachers on leave; 9 received diplomas. 
The Royal Stenographic Institute at Dresden is also classed among 
the secondary schools. This school of 9 teachers offers both elementary 
and secondary courses. In the winter of 1889-90 the elementary 
course had 71 students, while the secondary, which prepares for par- 
liamentary shorthand and newspaper practice, had 18 and 86 respect- 
ively. The number of diplomas granted, however, was only four. 
ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS, 
During the year 1889 Saxony had 4,251 institutions that may be 
classed as elementary schools. The great majority of these were pub- 
lic (or people’s) schools, namely, 4,139, including 1,934 continuation 
schools (post-graduate courses). There were also 90 private or en- 
dowed church schools, 2 schools for deaf mutes, 4 blind asylums, 5 asy- 
lums for orphans and weak-minded children and 11 reform schools. 
The sum total of pupils in these elementary schools was 664,640, of 
whom 578,794 were pupils of public schools (exclusive of continuation - 
schools); 952 children were taught at home by private teachers and 
governesses, 265 in number. : 
The number of public schools was 2,205, of which 22 were exclusively 
boys’ schools, 27 girls’ schools, and 2,156 schools in which both sexes 
were taught. Hence the ratio was 1 per cent boys’ schools, 1.2 per 
cent girls’ schools, and 97.8 per cent mixed schools. Of the latter 4.8 
per cent had separate classes for boys and girls throughout, 11.6 per 
cent had the sexes separated in a few classes only, and 81.4 per cent 
were mixed throughout. Hence, in only 415 of all the public’schools 
was coeducation practiced. But this does not state the case correctly, 
for these mixed schools are chiefly small ungraded schools in villages 
and small towns; in larger towns and cities the sexes are separated. 
Of 578,794 public-school pupils there were 284,033 boys and 294,761 
girls. Of the boys 42.6 per cent were taught separately, and of the” 
girls 42.8 per cent. 
Classifying the public elementary schools of Saxony according to their 
courses of study we find that 1,985 (or 90 per cent) were simple elemen- 
tary, 208 (or 9.4 per cent) intermediate, and 12 (or 0.6 per cent) higher 
elementary schools (schools offering secondary instruction).
-P-A-G-E-330
    CoO tS: EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
‘The grading of pupils has progressed in Saxony much farther than 
- in Prussia. The statistics of 1889 show that the schools of 2 and 4 
grades or classes still predominate, but that the number of better or- 
ganized and graded schools is on the increase. Of the total number 
of schools 39.8 per cent were schools of 2 grades or classes; 6.5 per cent 
had 3 classes; 23.5 per cent had 4 classes; 2.5 per cent had 5;.12.1 per 
cent had 6; 8 per cent had 7; 7.6 per cent had 8 or more grades or 
classes. Regarding the attendance, it shows that schools of 2 and 3 
classes, although nearly one-half of all the schools, contain only 15 per 
cent of all the pupils; hence, that 85 per cent of the pupils are in 
_ schools of 4 or more grades, and that nearly one-half of all the pupils 
attended schools of 7 or more classes. These are certainly very favora- 
ble conditions. Another interesting piece of information is found in 
the chapter devoted to the average number of pupils to the teacher; in 
simple elementary schools, the average number of pupils to the teacher 
was 47 (in Prussia the law makes it 75); in middle public schools the 
average number was 40, and in higher public schools it was 26. 
In regard to the daily attendance the notable fact has been discovered 
' that the better a school is organized, that is to say, the better graded 
it is, the greater is the average attendance. It was found that the daily 
attendance in schools of but two or three classes fell somewhat below 
the expected average, while it surpassed the average in fully graded 
schools. Asis the case in nearly all countries of Europe, the daily attend- 
ance is not computed from the teacher’s daily register, but the attend- 
ance on two test days is taken. On these days it was found that the 
total number of teachers was 10,102, namely, 7,689 men and 2,413 
women. Among the latter, however, were 2,203 women who taught 
only needlework a few hours a week, and were not regularly licensed 
teachers, Deducting these, we find that only 210 women were licensed 
teachers in Saxony; hence that the total number of teachers was 7,899, 
In regard to the position of the teachers the following item is not 
without interest: There were, in 1889, 266 rectors, or principals of 
buildings, who either did not teach or who taught only an hour per 
day; 6,028 regular teachers, excluding special music, drawing, and 
gymnastic teachers, 1,353 assistant teachers, 86 special teachers, and 
166 substitutes. These 7,899 teachers taught altogether 12,918 classes, 
hence the number of teachers actually needed was 5,019 short. 
Of the total number of teachers 7,570 had received professional 
training in normal schools, 215 in universities; 114, chiefly women, 
had obtained their diplomas after private preparation. Only 6,966 
were born in Saxony, 894 in other parts of Germany, 39 were for- 
-.eigners, 7,770 belonged to the Evangelical, 126 to the Catholic, 
and 3 to the: Reformed Church. Concerning other items, such as 
length of service, salaries, ete., the official report gives no information, 
but other sources of information at the disposal of the Bureau make it 
appear that the salaries of teachers are somewhat higher than in other
-P-A-G-E-331
    EDUCATION IN GERMANY. 303 - 
parts of Germany. But since this information comes chiefly from large 
cities and refers only to conditions in those cities, it would be unwise 
to take them as a basis for an average. The official report promises 
extensive information on this and similar points of school organization 
for next year. 
CONTINUATION SCHOOLS. 
Regarding continuation schools it may be mentioned that 1,912 of 
them (among which were 13 exclusively for girls) were in organic con- 
nection with public elementary day schools, while 22 (among which were ° 
3 for girls) had an independent organization. In 1,117 of these institu- 
tions (among which were 21 independent) school was kept all the year 
round; in 712 only during the winter. In the remaining 105 institu- 
tions instruction was interrupted for some months during harvest time. 
In 1,596 of the continuation schools instruction, was. given on week 
days; in 195 on Sundays only; in 153 alternately on week days and 
Sundays. The entire number of pupils who attended continuation 
schools was 75,938, namely, 74,659 boys and 1,279 girls. 
The current expenditures in 1889 for all public clementary schools in 
Saxony (including continuation schools) was a little more than 18 mil- 
lion marks ($4,500,000), cost of erecting buildings not included. This 
shows a per capita of school population of 28 marks (or $7) and a per 
capita of the entire population of 5.10 marks (or $1.22), The commu- 
nities paid 53 per cent for the maintenance of public schools, the state 
8 per cent; 28 per cent were raised by tuition fees, and 11 per cent 
were defrayed from the interest of irreducible funds, bequests, fines, 
etc., generally termed miscellaneous sources. In the share of the State 
mentioned (8 per cent) there is not included what the State pays for 
teachers’ pensions, widows and orphans’ support, etc., which expendi- 
tures amounted to 880,000 marks (or $220,000). 
SPECIAL SCHOOLS. 
Besides the schools that offer elementary and secondary instruction 
for general culture, there were in 1889 in Saxony a great aumber of 
special schools, to wit, 87 institutions for industrial education, which 
may briefly be called professional or trade schools, and 28 industrial 
continuation schools. Many of these institutions are of recent origin. 
Of the former 35, and of the latter 11, have been established during the 
last 10 years. Of the older ones, 12 date their establishment back be- 
fore 1840, hence have now a history of half a century; 5 were founded’ 
between 1840 and 1850, 12 between 1850 and 1860, 8 between 1860 and 
1870, and 15 between 1870 and 1880, The greatest number of industrial 
schools, as compared with the population, is found in the district of 
Zwickau, owing to the fact that that locality has a great” variety 
of industries carried on in factories and large and small workshops. 
The large industrial centers also support many of these special schools. 
     
-P-A-G-E-332
  304 EDUCATION» REPORT, -1889-90. 
Their founders and supporters here, as well as in other parts of Saxony, 
are socicties and labor unions, while the communities hesitate to estab- 
‘lish and maintain them. The state, on the other hand, vies with pri- 
vate enterprise-in the establishment and maintenance of special or 
trade schools; and besides maintaining state schools it liberally subsi- 
dizes private schools. 
In strict accord with the increase in the number of special schools 
during the last 10 years, the number of pupils increased. During the 
last 5 years the number of pupils in these industrial schools increased 
from 5,202 to 7,618, and that of industrial continuation schools from 
4,751 to 7,912 pupils. This phenomenal increase is attributable, in a 
measure, to the fact that the communal school authorities in some dis- 
triets have made attendance at industrial continuation schools com- 
pulsory; partly, also, owing to the resolutions of some labor unions 
which make attendance at such schools a condition of admission to the 
privileges of the unions. ‘From the attendance at these special 
schools,” says the official report, “it may be surmised that the prej- 
udice against special industrial or trade schools is giving way to the 
idea that a thorough professional education alone can aid the trades- 
man in his struggle for life.” 
The expenditures of special or industrial schools in 1888 was 629,471 
marks (or $157,368), or 83 marks (about $21) per capita. The indus- 
trial continuation schools cost 100,155 marks (or $25,040), or 13 marks 
(about $3.25) per capita. Of these sums the state defrayed 52 per cent 
for the special schools and but 19 per cent, for the continuation schools. 
Compare these figures:

  In order to place the above facts concerning industrial and special 
schools in proper relief it may again be mentioned that Saxony covers 
little more area than the State of Connecticut, and that'it has a popu- 
lation of 3,500,513. 
OTHER SPECIAL AND PROFESSIONAL SCHOOLS, 
* A statement of the educational efforts of the kingdom of Saxony 
would be incomplete, if art, commercial, and agricultural schools were 
not mentioned. Saxony has 12 art institutions (such as art academies 
for painting, sculpture, and decoration), 9 agricultural and horticultural, 
and 32 cémmercial schools. They had together 7,179 pupils. Exelu- 
sive of academies of music and schools of dramatic art, the three kinds 
of special schools above-mentioned required an expenditure of 781,629
-P-A-G-E-333
    EDUCATION IN. GERMANY. 805 
marks (or $195,407), of which sum the state defrayed 46 per cent. All 
these institutions, except those for music and the dramatic art, are in- 
tended for and frequented by young men almost exclusively. In con- 
sideration of the obvious fact, that in consequence of the changed social 
conditions women have acquired a much more extended sphere of useful- 
ness than formerly, the state recognizes, much less than does society it- 
self, the urgent necessity of establishing special schools for women. This 
is seen from the statement that of the 11 professional schools for women, 
only 5 have been established by societies, and 5 owe their existence to. 
private enterprise, while only 1 is a state institution. These 11 schools 
were frequented by 1,081 young ladies (an average of 98 to the institu- 
tion). The source ta which these items were drawn gives the total” 
expenditures for only 9 of these schools, namely, 72,555 marks (or 
$18,139), of which the state contributed 9,500 marks (or $2,375). 
CONCLUSION. 
The foregoing facts disclose a very interesting picture of the educa- 
tional affairs of a small part of Germany. They show that the royal 
government of Saxony is fully alive to the urgent demands of modern 
society; that it fully comprehends the importance of the fierce struggle- 
for subsistence going on in Europe, both among states and individuals. 
Saxony has a greater variety of educational institutions than any other 
state in Germany, and, indeed, in Europe. :

a                           EXPLANATION OF THE GRAPHIC STATEMENT, 
The national economy of the Kingdom of Saxony, between the years 
1875 and 1879, may be studied from some symptoms presented in the 
diagram attached. The year 1875 istaken at the point of zero. Twenty- 
one symptoms of prosperity are enumerated. Several curves which 
sink below the medium line indicate the period of decreasing prosperity 
that followed in the wake of the great panie which swallowed up mil-_ 
lions of dollars and checked the increase of wealth, comfort, and virtue. 
Tn particular, the lines indicating the number of marriages, consump- 
fap tion of beer and meat, travel and freight business on railroads, surplus 
     
-P-A-G-E-335
  EDUCATION IN GERMANY. 307 
of state property over indebtedness, sink below the figures known for 
1875. But all these lines curve upward again before the year 1880 ig 
reached, The other positive momenta of prosperity in the diagram do 
not show a downward curve, but even these indicate by their slow in- 
crease that they were affected by the great calamity. 
Of the negative momenta only one dates back to 1875, to wit, that of 
the number of suicides. The other four are (a) the number of people 
dependent upon charity; (b) the number of criminals in general; (c) 
the number of sentences for theft; (d) the number of tramps and beg- 
gars. These numbers show a rapid decline, in accordance with the 
well-known fact, that in time of general prosperity crimes against prop- __ 
erty decrease in number, and are offset by the number of crimes | 
against the person and the state. 
The following is a tabulated statement:

Like the negative, the positive momenta signify throughout a grad- 
ual improvement of the economic conditions since the year 1880. This 
is especially obvious when we examine the number of marriages, which 
had in 1884 again reached the number that were reported in 1875. 
Better results even are obvious when we observe the estimated in- 
come of the population and compare this with the curve illustrating 
the consumption of meat and beer. Another symptom of prosperity is 
found in the increase of railroad traffic, and the rapid increase in the 
use of stationary steam engines, which signifies an increase in manu- 
factures. Saxony being essentiallya manufacturing country, this symp- 
tom is well chosen. Equally incontrovertible as a symptom of pros- 
perity is the curve that signifies the rising value of buildings and the   
     
-P-A-G-E-336
  308 EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90, 
increase of insurance on chattels, both lines showing an almost paral- ’ 
lel tendency. More decided even than the foregoing are the lines that 
- show the increase in thrift. The two lines, to wit, the one showing the 
number of depositors, and the other the number of small depositors, 
people of very small means, prove a very happy state of affairs. 
Finally, the graphic presentation enables us to see that the positive 
momenta of prosperity curve upward, and the negative downward in a 
much greater degree than does the population curve. . 
It seems unnecessary to burden these reflections with facts embodied 
_ in figures; they are minutely stated in “‘ Zeitschrift des K. Sichsischen 
Statist. Bureaus,” Jahrg. 1890, Heft 1 and 1. 
VIII.—ScHOOL-GARDENS. 
{Sources of information, “Volksschulgarten and Volksschulhaus” by Dr. J. D. Georgens, Berlin; also ‘'Kolnische Zeitung” No. 1051, 1891.) 
As early. as the beginning of the fourteenth century there were found 
in a few cities of Italy (for instance, in Salerno and Venice) institu- 
tions in which plants from all the parts and climates of the world were 
‘raised or cultivated for purposes of education and the enhancement of 
science.” However, these institutions, called botanical gardens, did not 
come into general use until natural science experienced the revival 
that astonished the world by its suddenness and brilliant results. The 
wealthy cities of Italy, led by. Ferrara, vied with each other, early, 
after the revival, in establishing such gardens. The universities of 
France and Spain followed thisexample. It is true, the establishment 
of a botanical garden in Paris, at the close of the sixteenth century, 
had its cause inthe trivial desire to furnish new floral designs to the 
embroiderers of court gowns. Not until 1626 was the garden trans- 
formed into an institution for scientific purposes, in which most plants 
of the world were raised. Later it received the name “Jardin des 
Plantes.” Also in Germany a lively interest in botanical gardens was 
manifested during the closing decades of the sixteenth century. Their 
establishment was usually contemporaneous with the foundation of uni- 
versities. At present no German university is without a botanical 
garden that furnishes the material for instruction in botany, biology, 
and physiology, and is frequently also used as an experimental station 
for raising and cultivating agricultural plants. 
In view of these facts it seems curious that it did not occur to any 
one to demand such gardens for lower schools, . The first who expressed 
the idea was Comenius, who said that every school should have a garden 
in which ‘the pupils may let their eyes ‘graze’ by watching the trees, 
flowers, and herbs.” He recognized in the school garden a means of 
awakening and promoting the desire for knowledge. Pestalozzi also, 
enthusiastic as he was for youth and school reform, demanded that the 
_ young, purely for purposes of education, should be occupied in field 
 
-P-A-G-E-337
  EDUCATION IN GERMANY. © = 809 
and garden. Frdbel laid much stress upon having gardens for the in- 
fants’ pleasant occupation. He even termed his institutions for infants, 
Kindergiirten (children’s gardens). But the school garden as a means - 
for instruction in horticulture, agriculture, and natural history (chiefly 
botany) in the lower schools, is an idea of rather recent origin, and 
one that is not well understood even at the present day. 
Sweden, of all civilized countries, is the one in which the school gar- 
den is found in general use. The leading authorities in that country © 
have recognized the fact that the elementary school may lend its aid 
in upbuilding national wealth by offering practical instruction in some 
branches of horticulture and agriculture. Sweden had, in 1876, 1,602 
school gardens; in 1881 this number had increased to 2,000. At 
present it is safe to say that there is scarcely an elementary school in 
Sweden without'a garden. 
In Belgium, a country which, aside from a great number of industrial 
pursuits, depends upon agriculture to a great degree, agricultural and 
industrial associations, as well as the government, have devoted much 
attention to school gardens for several years, and paid considerable sub- 
sidies to the promoters of these institutions. The considerable wealth — 
of therural population of Belgium arises from the cultivation of vegeta- 
ple gardens for the markets of the numerous cities of that densely popu- 
lated country, a state of affairs which is chiefly attributable to the es- 
tablishment of school gardens and the systematic and practical knowl- 
edge gained in them by the children. 
Also in France the idea of providing country schools with gardens” 
has found a fertile soil, especially since 1885, when the minister of agri- 
culture suggested and promoted the introduction of instruction in 
agriculture in the primary schools. 4 
In Switzerland the National Agricultural Association took the estab- 
lishment of school gardens in hand and displayed much zeal. Its 
efforts after several years were crowned with noticeable success, 
This led the Federal Government in 1885 to appropriate the sum of_ 
3,500 franes ($700) partly for plans to be submitted for consideration, 
partly for the maintenance of a few gardens already in existence. 
Since then the annual federal appropriations for maintaining school 
gardens have increased, and in 1888 sixteen communities of Switzer- 
land had well arranged and regularly used school gardens. The move- 
ment is still growing in importance as its beneficial influence upon the 
wealth of the communities is demonstrated. 
While Sweden in its school gardens aims chiefly at promoting agri- 
culture, and Belgium and France aim at the culture of fruit trees and 
vegetables and also floriculture, in Switzerland this utilitarian view has 
been kept in the background and pedagogical considerations have dic- 
tated both the establishment and management of these gardens. They 
are intended in country schools of Switzerland partly to give the chil- 
dren theoretical knowledge of the culture of the plants most important for 
 
-P-A-G-E-338
  ORO EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90, _ 
: _ human life, such as medicinal and food plants, partly to afford practi- 
- _ cal exercises in the rational culture and treatment of plants, partly 
also to awaken the sense for horticulture and floriculture and habituate 
to order and floral ornamentation, and, lastly, to aid the instruction in 
botany. 
Austria, it may be said, treats the question from a more general 
and higher standpoint. The imperial law of 1869 introduced instruc- 
tion in agriculture into the normal schools and ordered the estab- 
lishment of school gardens for every country school. A ministerial 
order of August 20, 1870, decreed that the instruction in natural his- 
tory in the people’s or elementary schools should be given in connec- 
tion with practical exercises in the school gardens. This made the 
establishment of such gardens a necessity, and at present there are 
more than 9,000 school gardens in operation in Austria and more than 
8,000 in Hungary. Of course they are found chiefly in villages and in 
the country, not in the cities. The result of this movement in Austria 
has been most gratifying. The development of flourishing orchards in 
Bohemia and Moravia, with their world-renowned wealth of fruit, for 
instance, is directly traceable to the introduction of practical instrue- 
tion in the school gardens. 
In the German Empire the two States of Bavaria and Oldenburg 
_ especially have done much toward encouraging the practical teaching 
of agriculture, horticulture, and floriculture by establishing school gar- 
dens. Prussia has taken only one step, but that was taken nearly a 
hundred years ago. Instruction in the culture of fruit and forest trees 
_ was introduced into the normal schools, and the teachers have acted 
. ever since in the light of their early training. It is reasonable to say 
that the admirably managed forests and vast orchards of Prussia owe 
their existence and excellent yield in no small degree to the unostenta- 
tious influence of the country schoolmaster, who teaches both his pu- 
pils in school and the adult villagers in agricultural clubs. In these 
clubs the teachers are the moving spirits who teach new methods of 
procedure, furnish the members with new ideas for rational culture of 
soil and plants, and generally act like benefactors in disguise. But 
school gardens, such as arerecently suggested, arenot numerous in Prus- 
siaas yet. The botanical gardens of the large cities in Prussia are 
obliged to furnish the teachers of secondary schools with the required 
numbers of specimens of plants and parts of plants for instruction in 
botany. But that does not seem to reach the elementary schools in the 
cities and the country. No statistical data of school gardens-in Prus- 
sia are at hand. 
Now, if we consider that the knowledge of botany, of the structure, 
growth, and treatment of plants, can not be learned from books, any 
more than chemistry can be learned from the printed page, or arithme- 
tic without a blackboard or slate and paper, it becomes evident that a 
school garden, even if it be only a modest flower bed, is necessary. 
Botany has ceased to be a mere conglomeration of names (and Latin
-P-A-G-E-339
  EDUCATION IN GERMANY. : 311 a 
names at that) and a classification according to artificial systems. Bot- 
any is now taught according to biological principles, which require close 
observation of processes and conditions. Hence a school garden is a 
requisite of a good school. Again, so the German promoters of the | 
establishment of school gardens argue, if we consider that the condi- 
tions of modern times are particularly exacting, and that competition 
becomes fiercer as population increases; that more than ever before life 
requires wise economy and prudent utilization of the means of support; 
that all the other occupations rely upon successful agriculture in the 
state; that the state will always depend upon a healthy, well-to-do, and 
prudent agricultural population; that the industrial population is di- - 
rectly aided by the state by means of institutions such as special tech- 
nical schools, and by the introduction of manual training into the 
lower schools; if, lastly, we consider that it is most desirable to habit- 
uate youth to methods of order and thrift, qualities absolutely requisite 
in agriculture, it becomes manifestly necessary to provide the means for 
bringing about these conditions. The school garden is as necessary to 
a school as a black-board in the classroom. 
The esthetic side of. education also would be directly benefited by 
lessons in the school garden. The love of nature and natural processes 
of growth, and the development of forms, and the power to see a 
life’s vocation in the care of nature’s creations and products, these are 
matters to be learned: children must be habituated to them. The 
shortest way to that end is through the school garden. 
It is plain that local conditions and requisites will modify the gen- 
eral plan, if a plan should ever be prescribed; only this principle must — 
‘be adhered to: The school garden must not be regarded as a mere ap- 
pendix to a school, but as a worthy member of an organism. Hence it is 
desirable to assign regular lessons for every week to some work in the 
garden. In regard to the general character of the garden it is sug- 
gested that it should neither become a botanical garden nor an orchard — 
exclusively.. It should assume the model of a well-managed home gar- 
den, stocked with fruit trees, vegetables, and flowers. 
In the United States we frequently find the schoolhouses surrounded 
by spacious grounds that afford ample room for flower beds, shade and | 
fruit trees, and not unfrequently we find that teachers, inspired by 
Froebellian principles, apply a certain space of the grounds for object 
lessons in elementary botany. But the idea of having a school garden ; 
as a necessary complement of every elementary school is not gen- 
erally entertained, although no country would be better suited to the 
introduction of school gardens, space and means being available in 
greater abundance than in any European country.

  CHAPTER X. 
THE HIGHER SCHOOLS OF PRUSSIA AND THE SCHOOL 
CONFERENCE OF 1890.1 
  PREFACE. 
The following paper has been prepared for the purpose of indicating 
the recent movements in education in Prussia so far as they refer to the 
higher schools. The common schools on the one hand and the univer- 
sities on the other have been mentioned only incidentally. While the 
other German states have been referred to only for purposes of com- 
parison, the differences between the various systems are not so great 
as the similarities, and the same movements that haye been stirring in 
Prussia have been felt, and quite as keenly, throughout all Germany. 
An effort has been made to present a summary of the origin, develop- 
ment, and especially of the present organization of secondary educa- 
tion in Prussia; to show the intimate relation of the educational system 
to the national life; to reflect the current thought of the people on the 
higher schools, and to describe the agitation for reform that culminated 
in the conference held in Berlin, in December, 1890. The scene therein 
presented of the most powerful monarch in the world addressing an 
assembly of schoolmen on the details of school management, must be 
regarded as one of the most striking and remarkable episodes of educa- 
tional history. 
While accuracy has been sought in all the facts given, the treatment 
is purposely descriptive. So far as possible the German technical terms 
havebeen rendered into their nearest corresponding English equivalents, 
without too great regard to literalness of translation. It will be nec- 
essary in reading the body of the paper to bear constantly in mind the 
distinction, the very sharp distinction, that the Germans make between 
“Erziehung” and “Unterricht,” that is to say, between education in its 
truest and broadest meaning, and mere instruction and learning. I~ 
have in general used the word “education” to express the former, 
and “instruction” for the latter; but where education is used in this

sense the reader must not forget that the German means nothing less . 
than the total development of the child. 
A brief list of authorities is appended. There is little literature in 
English on this subject, and of course none on the recent reform move- 
ments, except newspaper clippings. A complete bibliography of all the 
pamphlets, brochures, and works of more pretension that have recently 
appeared in Germany on different phases of the school question would 
in itself require almost the space afforded by this chapter.

I—TuHE HIGHER SCHOOLS OF PRUSSIA. 
Historical sketch.—In Prussia, as in all other European states, educa- 
tion was at first the concern of the church. Signs of this early intimate 
connection of the school and church still survive—for example, the com- 
bination of educational and religious affairs under the direction of one 
minister (the minister for educational, spiritual, and medicinal affairs), 
and the teaching of religion in all the schools. Various princes issued 
decrees expressing their individual wishes in the sphere of education, 
and as early as 1552 Joachim IT formed a consistory to have a general 
sight of church and school affairs. Johann Georg in 1573 issued 
a visitation and consistorial order in which minute instructions were 
given for the instruction in the schools and for the direction of the

teachers. The supervising officials were the clergy, at the head of 
which was the consistory composed of four or five members, the chair- — 
man of which was the general superintendent. They were charged with 
traversing the provinces and visiting churches and schools. Ten years: ~ 
were allowed for the circuit of each province. 
The consolidation of Prussia and Brandenburg and the erection of 
the state into a Kingdom made a somewhat more centralized adminis- 
tration possible. Frederick the Great declared that education was the 
hobbyhorse of his old age, and he called Baron Zedlitz to carry out 
. his wishes. Many important measures were introduced, the chief one 
being an order relegating the examination for fitness to enter upon 
university studies to the preparatory schools. Up te this time, how- 
ever, a very general freedom had prevailed in school matters, and the 
central control was more nominal than real. Frederick William I was 
the first to claim the right of the state to issue binding regulations for 
the school system and to control their execution, The Allgemeine 
Landrecht (common law), issued under Frederick William II in 1794, 
declared the public schools to be state institutions, and contained 
among others the following legal regulations: 
(1) All public schools and educational institutions are under the im- 
mediate control of the state. oe 
(2) No one shall be refused admission to the public schools on ac- 
eount of his religious belief. 
(3) New teachers can not be engaged nor considerable changes made 
without the consent of the provincial school officials. : 
(4) Persons of wide knowledge, good morals, and good powers of 
judgment must be chosen as supervising officials. 
(5) Teachers in the gymnasia and other high schools will be regarded 
as officials of the state. 
That school system which has made Prussia great and has attracted — 
the attention of the civilized world dates from the darkest days of 
Prussian history. It was after the battle of Jena, when her chief uni- 
versity had been closed by the Corsican conquerer, her army practically 
annihilated, her very existence as a state. threatened, her people ex- 
hausted and disheartened, that Prussia, with a heroism and steadfast- 
ness perhaps never equaled in history, looked her ruin in the face and 
began seriously and steadily to rebuild the structure of her former — 
greatness. The summons to a nation sunk in selfishness and crushed 
beneath foreign oppression came from the philosopher Fichte in his 
address to the German nation. “No man, no God, and no event in the 
range of possibility,” said he, “can help us, but we must help ourselves 
if we are to be helped. The way to salvation consists in building up 
an entirely new common national self in the bringing up (Erziehung) 
of a nation whose former life is extinguished to a wholly new life. 
In a word, a complete revolution of the former system of education is 
what I propose as the only means of preserving the German nation in —   
     
-P-A-G-E-344
    316 EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
existence.” Fichte’s words fell like the voice of inspiration upon the 
ears of the despairing and exhausted people. The King, Frederick 
William ITT, said August 10th, 1807, “the state must make good through 
intellectual power what it has lost in physical strength.” In 1808 the 
Higher School College, which had previously had the direction of educa- 
tional affairs, was abolished and the duties of the same were transferred 
to the department of the interior as the third section, “for religious 
and public instruction.” Count Dohna was made the head of the 
ministry and Wilhelm von Humboldt was called to take charge of the 
third section. His plans for reorganizing the school system were most 
extensive and far reaching. His three greatest reforms, however, were 
the state examination for teachers, the reorganization of the course 
of study, and the final examination. Although Humboldt remained 
but for a year and ahalf at the head of this department, he gave to 
the school system of Germany a form which it has never lost and to 
education an impetus which is still felt. The changes since his time 
have been part of an organic growth and progressive development. 
Administration and orgenization—Prussia has no code of publie in- 
struction. In addition to the declaration made in the common law of 
Frederick II (see above) the constitution of 1850 has the following: 
For the education of the young special provision is to be made by means of the 
public schools. 
Everyone is free to impart instruction and to found and conduct establishments 
for instruction when he has proved to the proper authorities that he has the moral, 
scientific, and technical qualifications requisite, 
All public and private establishments are under the supervision of authorities 
named by the state. 
This constitutes the basis in the common law of the school adminis- 
tration. 
In 1817 the department of education was raised to the rank of a 
ministry. The administration of religious affairs was at first com- 
bined with education, later medicine was added, so that now the full 
title of the minister is Minister der Geistlichen, Unterrichts-und Medi- 
cinalangelegenheiten (minister of spiritual, educational, and medicinal 
affairs). 
Humboldt joined with him two technical councilors, which number 
- has now grown to eight, and they, with the minister and the under 
secretary of state for the department, constitute the central authority 
for the affairs of education. Prussia, however, enjoys considerable 
local self-government in educational matters. It was under Humboldt 
that profitable relations were first established between the central au- 
thority and the local governing bodies. Previous to his administration 
the central authority had been more nominal than real. 
In 1808 the districts of Prussia received the name of Regierwngen, or 
governments, and in each of these was established a deputation for 
worship and public instruction corresponding to the education depart- 
ment at Berlin. They represented the state authority in the super-
-P-A-G-E-345

vision of the schools in the provinces. In 1810 three scientific deputa- 
tions, one at Berlin, one at K@énigsberg, and one at Breslau, were ~ 
established to examine teachers for secondary schools and to advise 
the Government on important matters relating thereto. At present 
Prussia is divided into fourteen provinces and each province is divided 
into departments, of which there are thirty-six in all. There is a pro- 
vineial school board in each of the chief towns of each of the provinces 
and a governmental district board in each of the departments... The 
provincial school board has for its president the president of the proy- 
ince, and there are three or four other members, one of whom is the? 
director of the district which happens to have its center at:the provin- 
cial capital, one generally a Catholic, one a Protestant, and_one is 
always a man practically conversant with school matters, The district. 
board has, in the provincial capitals, the same director and. president 
as the provincial board, and in the other departments its. president is 
the president of the department and the remainder of the board is on. 
the same principles as the provincial board. For the gymnasiums, 
progymnasiums, and real schools of the first rank the state authority 
is the provincial school board; for real schools of the second rank, 
higher burgher schools, and the primary schools of all kinds, the Goy- 
ernment district board. Both boards maintain close relation with the 
minister of education at Berlin and report to him frequently. The 
scientific deputations are now replaced by seven examination commis- 
sioners, having their seats at the seven university towns of Prussia— 
Berlin, Kénigsberg, Breslau, Halle, Miinster, Bonn, and Greifswald. 
Each director in these deputations must report to the minister every 
year. 
The local administration of the higher schools has always been greatly 
varied according as they were Crown patronage schools, private pat- 
ronage, or mixed patronage schools, The Crown patronage schools are 
immediately under the provincial board. In most towns the local au- 
thority for schools of municipal patronage is the town magistracy, as- 
sisted by a city school councilor. 
General features.—The schools we are to deal with are of the class 
called by the French secondary, by the Germans higher, and sometimes 
called intermediate or middle schools. They fill by far the largest 
place in the German educational system. They are planned to take 
the boy at the beginning of his tenth year and keep him nine years, 
and to turn him out at 19 or 20 fit, or “ripe,” to use the German term, 
for university studies. He therefore spends not more than three years 
in the common schools or in preparatory classes before entering the 
higher school course, and as a rule not more than three years in his 
university studies, against nine years spent in the higher schools. 
These schools are entirely distinct from the Volksschule, or common 
schools. The latter are intended for the masses, and have a course of 
eight years’ duration; every German child must attend these schools, 
,  
-P-A-G-E-346
  318 EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
beginning with the completion of his sixth year and continuing until his 
fourteenth year, unless he attends preparatory classes of high schools. 
This common-school education is compulsory; attendance at the higher 
schools is not compulsory. In another paragraph the advantages at- 
tained by attending these schools will be somewhat fully explained. 
None of the Prussian higher schools are free schools. Higher schools 
are either under the patronage of the crown, of municipalities, of pri- 
vate individuals, or mixed patronage, but those for boys only are all in 
every sense public schools. They are under the immediate supervision 
of the education department; through some of its officials they follow 
the Lehrplan or programme of studies preseribed by the Government; 
and they qualify their pupils to pass the Government examinations. 
Private higher schools are few in number, and are for girls only, except 
in their lower grades. Such as are found conform to the programmes 
of the public schools, and are. taken advantage of by parents who do 
not wish to send their boys at an early age to a public school that is 
often overcrowded. The object is to fit the boy to pass at a later period 
into an advanced class in some one of the public schools. 
The schools are of three general types, corresponding in a general 
way to the classical, the Latin-scientific, and scientific courses in Amer- 
iean preparatory schools and colleges. The work, as will be seen by 
consulting the programmes of these schools, given elsewhere in this 
chapter, is much more advanced than that of American preparatory 
schools, and falls not far behind the standard of, say, the junior year in 
American colleges. The gymnasiums and progymnasiums are the 
classical schools; the real gymnasiums, the Latin-scientific schools; the 
real schools and higher burgher schools are the scientific schools; 
whereas we find in America these three courses running side by side in 
the same school; in Germany that is never the case. Precisely the 
arrangement found in American schools is one of the things most 
_ desired by many of the school reformers in Germany. We will take 
up each of these different types somewhat in detail. 
The gymnasium.—The name gymnasium came into use as early as 
’ the sixteenth century. The ministerial decree of the 12th of Novem- 
ber, 1812, ordered that all learned school institutions, such as lyceums, 
pedagogiums, collegiums, Latin schools, etc., should bear the name 
gymnasium. A gymnasium is and has long been a classical school. 
Tt has properly six classes, counted upward from the sixth, the lowest, 
and. called sexta, quinta, quarta, tertia, secunda, and prima. Sexta 
- and quinta constitute the lower division, quarta and tertia the middle 
division, and secunda and prima the higher division. In the three 
lower classes the course is one year; in the three upper it is two 
years, making the entire course nine years. There are two terms, or 
semesters, and generally two corresponding sections in each class, one 
section comprising the scholars who enter at Easter and the other those 
who enter at Michaelmas. The Klassen-System, or class system, which
-P-A-G-E-347
  THE HIGHER SCHOOLS OF PRUSSIA. 819 
keeps the pupil in the same class for all his work, has come to prevail 
generally. The programme and detailed courses of study that follow will 
give teachers a clear idea of the work of the school, and further de- 
seription is unnecessary. The progymnasium is simply a gymnasium 
which lacks the upper classes—that is, the two years of prima.

No No scholar is excused from religious instruction. Instruction was also 
imparied in the Hebrew religion. There were gymnastic exercises 2 hours per week 
for all classes, and voluntary exercises every Saturday afternoon on the large play- 
ground in Friedrichshain. The instruction in singing was as follows: 
(1) Lower sexta.—Beginning of harmony and rhythm; learning notes; practice of 
choral melodies and easy one-voicesongs. 3 hours. 
(2) Upper sexta.—Choral melodies and one-voice motettes and songs. 3 hours. 
(3 and 4) Lower quinta.—This class was divided in two sections, according to the 
voices of the scholars (soprano or alto). Each section sang somewhat difficult one- 
voice songs, motettes, etc. 3 hours. With promotion to upper quinta the scholars 
who have taste and ability for music go at once into the first singing class. 
(5) The second singing class for sopranos and altos, which includes scholars from 
upper quinta, lower quinta, and upper quarta. In this are practiced easy hymns, 
songs, and sacred selections for two voices. 2 hours. 
(6) The second singing class for tenors and basses. This includes the scholars in 
the upper classes whose voices have changed. They practice the samo class of music 
as 5, and both prepare for choir singing. 
(7) The first singing class for the complete chorus. Practice of four (and more) 
voice sacred selections, with an orchestra, singing pioces like Handel’s Oratorios. 
The chorus sings regularly twice a week one hour. There are two more hours ap- 
pointed in which the sopranos and altos have special preparation for their parts,

Drawing is obligatory in the lower classes, sexta, quinta, and quarta, and elective: 
in the upper classes. The instruction was as follows: 
Sexta.—Straight lines in different positions. Angles and their division, squares and 
their combinations. Representation of different shaped bodies with flat surfaces in 
various groupings: Circles, rosettes, ellipses. Application of the different curves in 
ornamental forms. 2 hours. 
Quinta.—Free-hand drawing of symmetrically arranged figures according to wall 
charts. Application of the square, rhomb, and parallelogram. 2 hours. 
Quarta.—Continuation of free-hand drawing after charts; elective instruction in 
drawing; artistic free-hand drawing after models and plaster casts (heads and parts 
of heads, ornaments, flowers, landscapes, animals) to antique heads from plaster, 
with light and shade according to different methods of technical treatment; de- 
scriptive geometry; aquarelles. - 2 hours. 
Real-schools—The name Realschule or Real-school was first used at 
Halle. Christoph Semler, in 1738, established there a school with this 
title. Isolated schools of this type were found in various parts of the 
country, but they were not successful until about 1822. In 1832 the 
government began to occupy itself somewhat with them, and in 1859 a 
definite plan and course was framed for them, as had previously been 
done for the gymnasium. Three kinds of real-schools were distin- 
guished in this government order of 1859—real-schools of the first 
rank, real-schools of the second rank, and higher burgher schools. In 
the words of the decree, all these three classes “have the common pur- 
pose of affording a general scientific preparation for those callings for 
which university studies are not required.” Real-schools of the first 
and second order had, like the gymnasiums, a nine years’ course; the 
higher burgher schools a six years’ course. In real-schools of the first 
order Latin was a required study; real-schools of the second order did 
not have Latin in their course and could adapt themselves more to the 
local needs. The programmes of each of these schools given below - 
will clearly indicate the differences existing between them. As the 
terms are at present used, all schools except gymnasiums are included 
under the general name of “real institutions,” and give a “realistic” 
or ‘‘scientific and practical” training. Higher real-schools are schools 
without Latin, having a full nine-years’ course. Real-schools simply 
Jack the two upper classes of higher real-schools. They are 7-class insti- 
tutions. 
The real gymnasium.—By a government order of the 31st of March, 
1882, the study plan of the real-schools of the first order was materially 
modified and the name real-gymnasium was applied to them. This 
class of schools are therefore now called in Prussia real-gymnasiums, 
and in the other German. states real-schools of the first order. The 
change made consisted briefly in increasing the amount of Latin by 
about 25 per cent. The privilege which had been earnestly sought by 
friends of the real-gymnasium, of allowing its graduates to enter upon 
the study of medicine, was not, however, granted. It is about the real- 
gymnasiums that the reform battle, so far as it refers to external school 
relations, has chiefly raged, and the programme given below will there-

fore be of special interest. The changes made when the course was 
reorganized and the name real-gymnasium was introduced may be 
seen by referring to the programmes given in the appendix. S

(5) Christmas vacation: Close of instruction, Saturday, December 16; 
beginning of instruction, Monday, January 4. 
The vacations correspond in general to the above scheme. 
Privileges —Aside from the importance which the higher schools 
would naturally assume in so intellectual and enlightened a nation as 
Prussia, there are certain valuable premiums set upon attendance upon 
the same by the Prussian Government that make them a tremendous 
factor in the social and industrial as well as intellectual life of the nation. — 
These are the Berechtigungen or privileges; and the position of the 
higher schools, in the popular estimation, can only be understood by 
earefully considering these privileges. 
The common schools, attendance on which is compulsory, give no 
privileges or rights. No public or professional career is open to a boy 
who has completed his common-school course. The right to one year 
volunteer military service is the one which is common to all the higher 
schools, and, therefore, we speak of it here first. As arule, every Ger- 
man youth must serve three years in the army; if, however, he has com- 
pleted six years of the course in the higher schools, that is to say, if as 
has completed the entire course of a higher burgher school, or the course 
as far as upper secunda of a gymnasium, real-gymnasium, or real-school, 
he may volunteer, as it is called, for one year to serve at his own expense. 
As all in the volunteer service are, to a certain extent, educated, and, 
since they pay their own expenses, presumably wealthy, this service is 
much higher than the ordinary service. It is, therefore, a decided dis- 
tinction to belong to it, and families of limited resources often make 
great sacrifices to enable their sons to volunteer. 
Graduates of gymnasiums have open to them nearly all the avenues 
to posts of honor and profit. They are admitted to the universities 
and to the study of any of the learned professions, as well as to teach- 
ing in allits branches. Graduates of the real-gymnasiums are excluded 
from the learned professions, and may ‘study only with the philosophical 
faculty of a university, and may become teachers only in mathematics” 
and modern languages, and are then eligible for positions only in real- 
schools. The real-schools qualify for admission to the technical high 
schools. For the privileges of the various classes of schools, as recom- 
mended by the conference, the reader is referred to Conelusions of the 
Conference (p. 393), under question 13. 
It will be readily seen that the way to any high position, in the army, 
in the Government service, in all the professions, lies, in Prussia, 
through some one of the higher schools. The right of one-year military 
service is the one most generally coveted and striven for. But the 
other privileges interest a vast number. The choice of an occupation 
and settlement therein is much more difficult in Germany than here; 
change from an occupation once chosen is likewise more difficult; so 
difficult that it seldom takes place, and changes of importance can only 
be made by the central government. Moreover, it must be borne in 
     
-P-A-G-E-356

mind that these different classes of high schools do not exist side .by 
side; but that one place will have only a gymnasium, another only a 
real-school, another only a higher burgher school. The case of poor 
parents witha bright son, whom they wish to educate to the profession 
of medicine, situated in a town where there is a real-gymnasium only, 
will help us to appreciate the importance the school. question. has as- 
sumed to the common people. These parents might send their son 
through the complete course in the real-gymnasium, and yet he could 
not be admitted to study medicine. It was for such cases as this that 
the union school was recommended as a common preparatory school 
with a six years’ course. Parents in humble circumstances might. be 
able to send their sons the last three years to the necessary finishing 
school, if it was arranged so that the first six years of the course might 
be taken at home. But this arrangement did not find favor with the 
conference. < 
Final examinations —The final examination in the higher schools, 
variously. called graduating examination, examination for maturity, ex- 
amination . for ripeness, examination for dismissal, etc. (Abiturienten- 
examen, Reifepriifung, Maturitiitspriifung, Entlassungspriifung, Ab- 
gangspriifung), is the focus of the school system. On it depend all the 
privileges that graduation from any of the higher schools confers. The 
scholar who presents himself for this examination receives a certificate 
of ripeness or of unripeness. He may go to the university with his 
certificate of unripeness, but the conditions are then unfavorable and 
unpleasant.. This examination has existed since 1787.. Humboldt re- - 
formed it with the object of diminishing the throng of ill-prepared can- 
didates who presented themselves at the universities. For, inasmuch 
as, to quote the words of Dr. Hartwig in his address before the con- 
ference, ‘a certificate of incapacity could not-be refused to the most 
ineapable, people paraded themselves as academic citizens who had 
not the least presentiment of Greek, knew quite as little of history and 
mathematics, and of Latin often not more than the alphabet.” The 
introduction of examinations for admission held by the universities 
themselves only made matters worse, for the university faculties proved 
themselves very reluctant to turn candidates away. Between the high 
standard of the Government and the low standard of the universities it 
came about that there was really no standard at all. Humboldt orig- - 
inated a general regulation for examination, obligatory in all cases. 
According to this there were three grades of certificates, the first de- 
claring its possessor thoroughly qualified for university studies; the 
second declaring him to be partially qualified, and the third declaring 
him tobe wholly unqualified. The way in which the universities 
cobperated in Humboldt’s ideas may be illustrated by the fact that at 
Bonn, in the year 1822, out of 139 certificates for that year 122 were 
of the third class, declaring the holders unqualified. for the university, 
16 were of the second ¢lass, declaring him partially qualified, and only
-P-A-G-E-357
  THE HIGHER SCHOOLS OF PRUSSIA. 329. - 
1 was of the first. class, declaring him thoroughly qualified. The 
regulation of the 12th of June, 1834, greatly increased the severity of 
the examination, and in 1856 it was again somewhat diminished. In 
1882, an additional regulation was issued which added questions in 
geography to the oval examination, also oral translation from French 
and written translation from Greek. The written translation into 
Greek and into French was relegated to an earlier time. As it exists 
to-day the examination is both oral and written. The paper work lasts™ 
a week. The oral examination is open to the public. The teachers 
attend in full dress. Each class is examined by its instructor, and the 
president of the examining commission may choose any passage for 
translation and put any question he thinks proper. ; 
Specimens of the topics set for the written examination may be seen 
in the courses of study of the various schools given above. If the 
commission are not unanimous about passing the candidate, they vote. 
The president may, howeyer, refuse to pass the candidate, though the 
majority have voted for him. In such a case the papers-must go to the- 
highest authority for their decision, The certificates are given out to 
the successful candidates at the solemnity or solemn dismissal which 
takes place in the Aula of the school at the end of each semester. The 
usual order of exercise in a gymnasium consists of music, Latin, Greek, - 
French, and German addresses, each by a member of the graduating 
class; a farewell address from one of the remaining students to those - 
departing; and an address by the rector followed by distribution of » 
diplomas. The general plan is about the same in all the other schools. 
Every effortis made to avoid cramming and special preparation, and 
to make the examinations such as “a scholar of fair ability and proper 
diligence, may at the end of his school course come to with a quiet 
mind, and without a painful preparatory effort, tending to relaxation 
and terpor as soon as the examination is over.” Since 1834 there has 
been a good deal of general public feeling in favor of lightening the 
‘severity of these leaving examinations. The school conference, as will 
be seen further on, changed it somewhat in the way of simplification, 
but there was very strong opposition among the members to lighten-- 
ing it or making it easier. Dr. Jiiger in his address before the con- 
ference gave expression to these views when he said, “If I am in favor 
of the simplification I am on the contrary not in favor of an alleviation; 
[expressly guard against that. The difficulty of this examination re- 
mains as before, for, and I will say that also, we ought not to go too 
far in unburdening the youth. We must remember that the youth 
whom our gymnasiums educate, in the future will come into the most 
responsible positions; into positions where their capacity for work may 
have very unusual claims made upon it. Therefore the youth must 
learn already in the gymnasiums to work more intensely than other 
youths; and, therefore, it is right and just that at the end of this nine 
years’ course the examination must be approached. If you lighten it 
   
-P-A-G-E-358
        330 i EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
too much then you create an intellectual proletariat. In that case all 
would pass the examination as you fasten the ribbon of the legion of 
honor in your buttonhole. That I should like to avoid. I am there- 
fore for preserving and indeed for simplifying but not for easing the 
examination.” 
Gymnastics.—The ninth question submitted by the minister of edu- 
eation to the conference concerned itself with the instruction in gym- 
nastics, and the positive and energetic utterances of the Emperor on 
this subject gave it a prominent place in the deliberations. Gymnastics, 
or “Turnen,” as the Germans speak of it, early found place in the sehool 
- programmes of Prussia, but for various reasons ceased to be obligatory 
upon the pupils. A government order in 1842, however, declared that 
gymnastic exercises should henceforth be obligatory in all the schools 
of the kingdom. As a rule they have occurred two hours weekly, and 
the schools have been divided for this purpose into rather large see- 
tions. Notwithstanding the severe strictures made by the Germans 
themselves, an American visitor can hardly fail to be impressed with 
the excellence of the provisions for this training. Even the common 
schools are provided almost universally with excellent halls, very fre- 
quently in a separate building, most admirably equipped for such kinds 
of class work as can be carried on in the school. The work consists of 
exercises with dumb-bells, wands, rings, on the ladder, on the parallel 
and horizontal bars, jumping, running, playing hand ball, and va- 
rious marching exercises, often carried on to the accompaniment of 
music. There is also, as a rule, either immediately connected with the 
school building or in some other part of the city, not infrequently in 
the park, a play ground also equipped with parallel and horizontal bars 
and other apparatus for such exercises as may be advantageously ear- 
ried on in the open air.’ So far as possible the exercises are conducted 
on the play ground in pleasant weather. The school is often taken to 
the play ground for the afternoon hours, when regular class work is not 
carried on, but the children exercise as they please for the most part, 
always accompanied by at least one and generally several teachers. 
The instruction in gymnastics ean be imparted only by teachers who 
have qualified themselves especially for this work and have passed a 
special examination in it. They must, in addition, be regular teachers 
in the school and must therefore have passed the teachers’ examination 
and attained at least a third-grade standing. This at once excludes 
men who are simply athletes but lacking in the moral and intellectual 
faculties which should qualify them for helpful contact with the young. 
Usually they give instruction in some other branches and the instrue- 
tion in gymnasties is not as a rule intrusted to a single teacher, but 
is divided among two or more. That teachers’may qualify themselves 
for this particular work a special course, beginning the 1st of October 
and running through six months, is given in the Royal Institution for 
Gymnastic Training in Berlin. It can not fail to strike any observer  
-P-A-G-E-359
  THE HIGHER” SCHOOLS OF PRUSSIA. ~ ~ 331 
that the class exercises in gymnasties in the German schools are usually 
prepared with an aceuracy and finish that are often truly remarkable. 
The sense for discipline which is so strong in the German nature here 
showsitself. On festival and holiday occasions gymnastic exhibitions by 
pupils of the different schools often form a part of the day’s programme, 
and by no means the least interesting part. 
Where, then, are the weak points in the system? 
(1) The amount of gymnastic exercise provided for by the schools 
may be sufficient for perfecting the pupils in certain school exercises, 
but it is wholly and absolutely inadequate from the point of view of 
physical development. No one will for a moment maintain, even in 
Germany, that two hours a week is exercise enough to keep the grow- 
ing child in good health and further the development of its 7S 
organization. 
(2) But it may be asked whether any other country is any better off 
in this respect; whether it is possible to provide in a school for the 
necessary amount of exercise; whether this must not be left to the 
natural exuberance of the children, who will find their own exercise out- 
side of school hours and. free from school regulations? We must re- 
member that the German boy has practically no games; that is his 
one great misfortune; baseball, football, cricket, and tennis, are 
practically unknown in Germany. The exuberance of our American 
schoolboy which finds vent in an eager interest and participation in 
ail the games of his school; school ball teams, athletic contests be- 
tween rival schools; interacademic athletic associations, these find no 
place, they have no equivalent, in the life of the German schoolboy. 
His amusements are as a rule of a quieter order. He is not accustomed 
to act spontaneously and freely as is the American boy, and moreover 
after he has once entered upon the course of the gymnasium, or real 
school either, he is much more heavily burdened with school duties 
than our average American boy. By referring to the programmes of 
these schools given above and in the appendix, it will be seen that the 
number of hours per week is seldom less than thirty. To this is to be 
added as a rule the instruction in singing and gymnastics, and the 
home study, which may be reckoned at not less than from two or three 
hours per day. The figures in the Emperor’s speech show plainly what 
the state of affairs was when he was a student at the Gymnasium at 
Cassel. The result of all this is that the German boy differs as widely 
as possible from the American and English schoolboy. He is quieter, - 
more self-contained, lacking the wildness and exuberance, lacking also 
in the tremendous vigor which characterizes the youth of these two 
progressive nations. At eighteen he knows a great deal more Latin 
and Greek, he can go through methodical exercises with his class on 
the bars or with dumb-bells probably a great deal better than his 
Anglo-Saxon brother, but he will throw a baseball as awkwardly as a 
girl, and he would be homeless on the football field. A cricket 
         
-P-A-G-E-360
  332 EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
ball he would mistake for a cannon ball, and,consider it. quite as 
deadly. Tennis he would probably look down upon with some disdain 
as a game fit only for loungers and idlers. The inevitable result of such 
a condition of things is that the young men or rather boys spend much: 
time in quieter amusements, such as card-playing and billiards, and 
very often drink much beer as a preparation for their university course. 
It is a healthful sign that the Germans themselves are becoming fully 
aware of the fact that this is not the best physical preparation for life. 
There can be no possible question that athletic interests as fostered 
in the schools of England, and more and more in America, making an. 
allowance for all the evils that can be charged to them, have had a tre- 
mendous influence in shaping and determining the character of the race. 
No boy canbe at the same time a bummer and an athlete. Nine boys 
out of ten, with any sort of encouragement, would much prefer to be the. 
athlete. Intercollegiate and interacademic athletics may possibly be 
earried to excess occasionally, but it is the lack of precisely this interest 
which is the most fatal defect in the. young life of Germany. _Doubt- 
_ less the reason_lies in the national temperament to a large extent. The 
inspiration for a new order of things must come from the outside. The 
sehools filling as they do a place in the national life far greater than 
that occupied by our own schools, and exerting by all means the most 
potent of all the influences brought to bear upon the young, must, as 
has been clearly seen, force young men into a more active manner of 
living. Those who believe in school sports and school games will not 
be likely to believe that a number of hours per week more of perfune- 
tory class work in gymnastics will do it; they will rather think that 
they will be likely to dull whatever interest the child may possess in 
athletic exercise and make it but a part of an obnoxious task. But 
that the necessity to do something is so strongly felt is certainly a 
marked advance. The young Emperor himself, with his ardent love of 
out-door pastimes and healthy recreations, and his undoubtedly sincere 
and deep interest in the young, can not fail to influence national senti- 
ment in this respect in a most important and far-reaching manner. 
Giissfeldt, who is said to be inspired to a large extent by the Emperor, 
in his recent book, “The education of the German youth,” says that of 
twelve hours a day, four or five should be given to intellectual training 
and the rest to free exercises, plays and games, gymnastics with ap- 
paratus, skating and swimming, dancing and sports, and lastly indus- 
tries. His idea is evidently developed from the best schools of Eng- 
Jand, and it is to be noted that “gymnastics with apparatus” has a 
minor place in the system and the exercises which are proposed. 
“Free” exercises are undoubtedly what the German boys are greatly in 
need of. 
THE TEACHERS. 
Evamination.—The Staatspriiefung (government examination) for 
teachers in Prussia has long been famous. It originated with Wilhelm
-P-A-G-E-361
  THE HIGHER SCHOOLS OF PRUSSIA, 333. 
von Huinboldt, and the regulations governing it have been modified 
from time to time, especially in 1831 and 1866. Before 1810 the method 
of appointing teachers was very loose. No certificate of fitness to 
teach was required. Favoritism was the prevailing principle. 
The examination at present is held by one of the high examination: 
commissions. The candidate must present his certificate for ripeness 
for university studies and with it the certificate of three years’ attend- 
ance at university lectures. The examination itself is both oral and 
written. Fitness to teach in the gymnasium is the standard set... A 
special examination is required for teachers in the real-schools; in mod-. 
ern languages, history, geography, chemistry, and the descriptive nat- 
ural sciences. 
The examination refers, first, to the candidate’s general xeon 
for the teaching of philosophy, sents ogy, history, geography, and lan- 
guages, This part may be dispensed with if unusually excellent aca- 
demic certificates are presented. Second, to~the special preparation 
for the particular branches the candidate wishes to teach. The certifi- 
cate of fitness to teach—or facultas docendi—ean be acquired in any: 
one of the four following departments: (1) Philology and history; (2). 
mathematics and science; (3) religion and Hebrew;:(4) modern lan- 
guages. For written examinations every candidate must. present a 
thesis on the general field of philosophy and pedagogy, and in addition 
one or more theses on his special subject. If that be the classies it 
must be written in Latin; if modern languages, in.the language to 
which it relates. This thesis may be dispensed with in the case of 
graduates of the university with a degree of Ph.D. In case the ex- 
amination is passed the candidate receives a facultas docendi, which is 
bedingt or wnbedingt—conditional or unconditional. There are three 
grades, the first of which permits him to teach in the higher classes— 
prima and higher secunda, the second grade in lower secunda and. ter- 
tia, and the third grade in the lower classes. 
Trial year.—Having passed his examination the eandidate is not at 
once installed in a position, but must first pass through a Probejahr or 
trial year, which has been required since 1826. He is assigned to some 
gymnasium or real-gymnasium, not to the lower school—in order that 
he may at least become acquainted with the methods in the higher 
schools even though his work shall lie afterwards in lower grades. He 
is under the charge of the director, and teaches from six to eight hours 
a week. He attends the teachers’ conference, visits the various classes, 
and is given every opportunity to make himself perfectly familiar with 
his future calling. The director is specially enjoined not to regard the . 
candidate as a means of relieving an overburdened teaching staff. As 
a rule the candidate receives no pay, but if he is required to do the 
work of an.assistant teacher he is then entitled to corresponding re- 
muneration. At the end of the year a report of his work is made out 
by the director and presented to and approved by the provincial school 
board.

        334 EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
Rank and work.—The question of the rank of teachers in Prussia is 
one that has been not a little agitated. According to ancient custom 
the teachers in the gymnasia were adorned with the following appall- 
ing list of titles: Prorector, conrector, subrector, subconrector bac- 
ealaureus, collaborator, codperator, collega, cantor, and auditor. The 
divisions now existing are much simpler: Ordentlicher Lehrer (ordinary 
teacher) and Oberlehrer (higher teacher) and Director. Thetitleof Ober- 
Jehrer or higher teacher may be held only by those who in addition to 
the qualifications for the middle classes have the ability to instruct in 
at least two main branches up to'and including prima. The title of 
professor may be awarded as a distinction of Oberlehrer, in which case 
they rank equal to assistant professors in universities. Directors rank 
as full professors in universities and have a high social position. The 
directors teach from twelve to sixteen hours per week, the higher 
teachers from twenty to twenty-two hours per week, and the ordinary 
teachers from twenty-two to twenty-four hours per week. 
Appointments.—At the end of his Probejahr the candidate gets his 
appointment. The ordinary teachers are appointed by the provincial 
board, the higher teachers by the same with the approval of the min- 
ister of education, and the directors by the Crown, through the minis- 
try in all Crown patronage institutions. In schools of municipal or 
private patronage, the Crown’s assent is required. All directors and 
teachers, however appointed, are required on installation in office to 
take the following oath: 
Iswear to God the Almighty and Omniscient after I have been appointed as 
of the to be submissive, loyal, and obedient to His Royal Majesty of Prussia, 
my most gracious lord, to fulfill all the duties obligatory upon me by virtue of my 
office conscientiously and according to my best knowledge, and to faithfully ob- 
serye the constitution. So help me God.   
  
Material conditions—The salaries as a rule are small, judged from an 
American standpoint. The general scale is, for directors, from $975 to 
$1,350 per year; for teachers, from $375 to $975 per year. These fig- 
ures are supposed to represent the total income; in case a house is 
provided 10 per cent is deducted from the salary. There is an ascend- 
ing scale with length of service. According to the law of the Ist of 
March, 1833, teachers disabled from furthor duties receive pensions as 
follows: For ten years of service fifteen-sixtieths of the salary with 
increase of one-sixtieth for each additional year of service until the 
total reaches forty-five sixtieths. The trial year and time spent in 
military service is counted toward the pension, and the time spent in 
the field before the enemy is reckoned double. After the age of 65 all 
. are entitled to pensions and are liable to receive them’and be relieved 
from active service without requesting it. They are not prohibited 
from holding another employment (Nebenamt) along with their school 
posts, buf must get permission to do so, and it must be such as not to 
interfere with their school duties. They are at liberty to give private

instruction as much as they please. They are almost absolutely secure 
in their positions, The authority of the ministry extends no further | 
than reprimanding and stopping a month’s salary. The directors and 
higher teachers are under the jurisdiction of the court of discipline 
for the civil service at Berlin, a judicial body composed partly of mem- 
bers of the supreme court. Any complaints regarding the dismissal 
of a director or higher teacher must be triad before it. From the sen- 
tence of the court there is an appeal to the minister, who must ap- 
point two referees, one a member of the department of justice, to hear 
the appeal, and their decision is final. Complaints involving the dis- 
missal of ordinary teachers are tried by the provincial school board 
acting as acourt. From the sentence of the beard there is an appeal 
to the minister, who appoints one referee, and the referee, before de- 
ciding, must take the opinion of the court of discipline.

Il.—Tue Rerorm AGITATION. 
No attempt will be made here to trace he entire course of the agita- 
tion for reform of the school system. Reforms have continually been 
in progress in the system itself and outside agitation has been con- 
tinually going on. Nowhere have school questions been more thor- 
oughly discussed than in Germany. Especially, however, within the 
last ten years, that is to say since the school system was crystallized into 
about the form that it retains to-day, has the German public been 
flooded with a great mass of pamphlets, brochures, and articles in jour- 
nals attacking or defending the existing state of things. As the distin- 
guished president of one of the most prominent reform associations, 
Dr. Preyer; said in his inaugural address, “one thing at least is certain, 
that every possible shade of opinion, every conceivable idea, every 
practicable and impracticable scheme has at least had a hearing and 
been brought to the attention of the public.” Ht is scarcely conceiva- 
ble that any other plan remains to be suggested. Many of the sug- 
gestiohs have been wild and visionary, many more have been revolu- 
tionary when viewed from the standpoint. of the classical scholar, and — 
many have been the calm and thoughtful utterances of experienced 
school men, indicating in what direction needed improvements could be 
made without a revolution. We can get no idea of the scope and im- ~ 
portance of these discussions by comparing them with anything in the 
United States. So much local option in schoo] matters prevails here 
that the national agitation on these questions that stirred Prussia, 
and indeed all Germany, would be with us simply impossible. In 
order to understand anything of the national significance of this move- 
ment fer Prussia, the school organization and the vast importance of 
the higher schools in the national life must be continually berne in 
mind. The agitation has had something to do with the common schools, 
but we shall treat here only the higher or intermediate schools. With- 
out making any attempts to analyze the vast body of literature on this 
| 
         
-P-A-G-E-364
    336 EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
subject or to represent the almost innumerable ideas that have come to 
the surface, we shall simply attempt to indicate the marked and en- 
during tendencies, the strong and lasting, because well founded, move- 
ments. : 
The agitation falls naturally into two great divisions, first, that 
which concerns itself with the school organization and with the external 
school relations, with the relations of the schools to each other and 
to the government and universities; second, that which refers to what 
we may call the internal affairs of the schools, such as hygiene, fre- 
quence of classes, etc., matters of equal importance to all kinds of 
schools and totally disconnected from the other class of questions. 
Tn regard to this latter class of questions the agitation has not been 
so much in the nature of a conflict as of an awakening and arousing of 
the people to an appreciation of existing evils and a desire for reform. 
The speech of the Emperor brought prominently to notice a new idea, 
namely, the duty of the schools to combat social democracy, which 
seems to have been original with the Emperor himself and does not fall 
properly under either of the heads mentioned. But this idea, coming 
as we have just said from the Emperor at the beginning of the confer- 
ence, had no part in the preceding agitation, and indeed it may be 
added that it is doubtful whether it has had much influence in a practi- 
cal way, although it did undoubtedly revive the national spirit in the 
schools and remind them forcibly of their duty to. educate citizens and 
not merely to produce scholars. 
Questions of external relations.—These refer to the general standing 
of gymnasiums, real-gymnasiums, and real-schools, the value of each to 
the nation and to the individual who receives their instruction, and the 
rights which each give to their graduates. The system as it existed up 
to the time of the conference was shaped so far as possible to emphasize 
the difference between these various schools and so far as possible to 
isolate each from the other. Transfer from one to the other was not 
easy, and especially transfer from one of the schools without Latin to 
one of the schools with Latin was practically impossible. The difficul- 
ties in the way were such as practically to prohibit any such change. 
The parent, therefore, had to decide when his son was nine years old as 
to his future career. If he sent him to the gymnasium, to be sure, he 
would be qualified for most of the desirable avenues of life, but should 
he later show marked mechanical abilities and evince a decided taste 
for a technical profession he must supplement his gymnasial work with 
a considerable amount of drawing and mathematics. If we consider the 
amount of work required of the gymnasial student and the military 
service which he must necessarily go through, we may understand how 
difficult it is to secure time for such supplementary study. If the father 
decided, however, for the real-gymnasium or the real-school, the boy was 
at once cut off from all of the learned professions, including to a great 
extent the teaching profession. The decision was therefore made when 
 
-P-A-G-E-365
  THE HIGHER SCHOOLS OF PRUSSIA. 
the boy was nine years old and he had very little choice if any in the 
matterhimself, There were not a few who recognized the disadvantages 
of such a condition and advocated the union school.as a common ~ 
substructure for all three existing classes of higher schools. The second 
question laid before the school conference had reference to such a common. 
preparatoryschool. Such aschool should take the pupil from the age of 
nine to fifteen through a course that would prepare him with advantage 
to turn after that period in the direction that his tastes and aptitudes 
then seemed to indicate. It would remove the necessity of deciding on 
the profession from the ninth to the fifteenth year. 
This was one of the main points. Another referred to the privileges 
accorded to the graduates of the higher schools. The graduates of the 
gymnasiums, as before shown, possessed far greater privileges than the 
graduates of the real-institutions. The advocates of the latter insisted 
that no proper test could be made of the efficiency of the real-schools 
as compared with the gymnasiums, so long as the former were so 
heavily handicapped by the unfavorable conditions under which they: 
worked. Parents, when somewhat undecided, would naturally choose 
the school that gave the greatest privileges to its graduates, and this 
fact alone was sufficient to account for the greater number of gymna- 
siums and larger attendance upon the same. For graduates of the 
real gymnasiums the right to study medicine, at least, was claimed. 
This had been claimed as far back as 1882, when the real-gymnasium 
received its present form, but was not granted. Professional men, as a 
whole, however, all being graduates of gymnasiums, insisted that the 
gymnasial training alone could give a proper preparation for the study 
of a profession, and that it would be bringing imperfectly trained men 
into the professional ranks of the country to widen the door that led to 
professional life. Prominent physicians, nevertheless, for example Dr, 
Freund, professor in Strasburg University, advocated the admission of 
real-school graduates to the study of medicine. This matter also came 
before the conference in question thirteen. Here the battleraged between 
the advocates of the old humanistic culture and the friends of the modern 
realistic culture. Associations were founded and journals inaugurated 
in the interests of both sides. “Der Schule, nicht dem Leben, dienen wir? 
(we serve the school, not life), was said to be the watchword of the clas- 
sical schools. They were taunted with being entirely out of touch with 
practical life. They replied by declaring that their training was the 
best possible training for all possible callings; and, if it were not that 
“man should not live by bread alone,” that there were other things to 
be considered than merely material welfare, and that the nation had— 
not simply to be instructed, but to be educated, to be brought up. They 
said, moreover, and this no one could deny, that classical training had 
prought Prussia to its present high position. Further, Prince Bishop 
Dr. Kopp undoubtedly expressed the conviction of a great number of 
ED 90——22    
     
           
-P-A-G-E-366
   EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
the educated class in the following words uttered by him before the 
conference: 
I can not decide, gentlemen, to surrender the fair chapter on moral and intel- 
lectual power in the nation to a perhaps risky ‘speculation. Iam rather fully and 
completely conscious of the responsibility with which I sit here, and, therefore, I 
say I would rather see the existing management of education on the whole pre- 
“served, and I conclude on that subject as follows: If I am mistaken in this, gentle- 
men, this mistake does not seem to me dangerous, for from this mistake have come 
the best guiding and directing powers of a people which, in the hardest dilemmas, 
has accomplished the most difficult task that history and Providence ever set be- 
fore a nation. But if the gentlemen, with their best meant principles and plans, 
are mistaken, they bear the heavy reopens of haying shaken the foundations 
of the intellectual and moral pewer of the nation. 
  Internal questions.—Chief of the questions under this head and one 
which more than any other touched the people at large and awakened 
popular interest in school reform was the “ Ueberbiirdungsfrage,” or 
the question of overloading or overpressure. It is not necessary to 
expatiate upon this question here. The programmes of the schools and 
the remarks of the Emperor in his opening address are sufiicient to 
show that an amount of overpressure existed which would seem enor- 
- mous by our standard. The Germans area patient people, accustomed 
to endurance and hard work, and they were therefore slow in awaken- 
ing to the consciousness of the fact that in their zeal for great accom- 
plishments they were exceeding their strength and exhausting their 
youth. But finally they did awaken to this consciousness. This was 
a matter which touched all schools alike. It came before the confer- 
ence frequently, but whether the conclusions of the conference accom- 
plished much in the way of relieving the pressure is a disputed point. 
School hygiene, as a question closely connected with the preceding, 
also received much attention. The enormous prevalence of near- 
sightedness and the startling number of suicides among school children 
could not fail to produce an impression. Recent Prussian statistics 
have shown that in four years three hundred boys and four hundred 
and nine girls under fifteen years committed suicide. The near-sighted- 
ness became so serious that the minister of education, von Gossler, asked 
Dr. Sehmidt-Rimpler, the celebrated oculist in Géttingen, to draw up 
a list of recommendations for diminishing the near-sightedness so prey- 
alent in German schools.! 
The question of better gymnasium instruction connected itself closely 
with the question of hygiene. As regards the instruction itself, it was 
held that the classes were two full; that the schools were too full; that 
1The regulations were as follows: (1) Teachers must acquire a enGwlotiee of sebeal 
hygiene; (2) That a medical attendant should be attached to the school staff and 
practically inspect not only the school building, but the individual pupils; (3) Send- 
ing practical instructions to the pupils to inform them of the best position of the 
body in reading, writing, and studying; (4) Abolishing the afternoon session so far 
as possible and allowing greater exercise in the open air; (5) Abolishing written 
tasks at home; (6) Not allowing the school course to extend over too many years.

the positions of the teachers were not satisfactory, and that German 
was not well enough taught. The following, from paragraph second 
of the constitution of the General German Association for School Reform, 
summarizes the chief points of attack of the agitators. The objects of 
the association are given as follows: 
(4) Common preparation for the higher schools (this refers to the commen or 
union six-class schools before mentioned). 
(2) The elevation of German to a central point of instruction. 
(8) Better school hygiene and greater care for the physical development of the 
youth. 
(4) Equal rights for real-institutions and gymnasiums the first prerequisite for 
thorough school reform. 
(5) Better preparation ofstudents for their later calling as educators and teachers. 
(6) Simplifying the system of examinations. 
(7) Greater coéperation of the parents in the duties and rights of education, 
Dr. Preyer’s address.—The following extracts from the address of_ : 
Dr. W. Preyer, president of the General German Association for School 
Reform, formerly professor in the University of Jena, delivered in the. 
constitutive assembly of the union, in 1889, illustrates the position of 
the more thoughtful reformers and g giv es a valuable survey of the reform | 
agitation: 
The present movement, by reason of the refusal of just demands, has reached a 
turning point; it is spreading more and more over al! Germany; it is ever growing 
more powerful; and should I be required to characterize it in a single phrase, I 
would say it is irrestrainable. * * * But the standard-bearers of the school-re- 
form movement are not to stand still. The government itself has declared that it 
has not yet come to “a full determination” concerning certain very important ques- 
tions. 
The greatest enemy of school reform in Germany, indifference, has actually been 
driven out of the field. 
- That party also which came into prominence through the declaration of some pro- 
fessors of the University of Heidelberg has lost respect and following in many cir- : 
cles from the very first moment on account of an actually false ‘affi ion. The 
phrase that, without foundation, was presented to us as a fact, that foreign lands 
often envy us on account of our humanistic gymnasinm, does not correspond to the 
truth. What foreign lands? England perhaps? In London it is entirely optional 
with the candidates for medicine and law whether they will study Greek or not, and 
in all Great Britain most excellent care is taken for the bodily development of the 
scholars, much better than with us. Iam ata loss to know who that are capable— 
of judging in that land still think favorably of our present gymnasium, 
And France? Many of my writings have been translated into French, and aeleie 
tion has then been called to the fact to what an extent the faults brought forward 
by me and others are to be complained of in the French schools. Yes, in part, the 
same criticism has been made there as here. But there ean beno doubt that French 
is brought much more into the foreground in French schools, and English in the 
English schools, than German in the German. The foreigners surpass us in this re- 
spect, as they do in all that relates to the cultivation of a national sentiment in the 
schools. 
In Italy no one acquainted with the conditions wishes to introduce our human- 
istic gymnasium. As representative of the University of Jena at the eight-hundredth- 
year jubilee of the University of Bologna, where most eminent scholars came to- 
gether from all quarters of the globe and all the lands of Europe, I had the best of   
    
      
 
-P-A-G-E-368
  340 -  £DUCATION REPORT, 1889-90, 
opportunities to convince myself how much the esteem in which our gymnasia were 
formerly held in foreign lands, and especially in Italy, had fallen. This is true also 
in Austria, in Hungary, in Denmark, and in Holland. If we had such a suitable 
school system as Sweden many complaints would be silenced. Only in Russia are 
they attempting at present tointroduce strict old classical gymnasiums, in the hope 
of counteracting nihilistic exertions, obviously. Itis no secret how little sympathy 
the ministry in St. Petersburg has from intelligent, cultivated Russians in this effort. 
The address, which, according to its real contents, was not aimed at all against a 
reform of th ymnasia, has only attained a significance that is indeed ephemeral, 
from the fact the at it was intended from the first as a counter-demonstration to the 
great petition, having more than 22,000 signatures, to the Prussian ministry, But 
it will not in the least weaken the lasting effect of the latter. Rather will this great 
memorial, conceived by the deputy M. von Schenkendorff, who has deserved so much 
from the friends of school reform in other ways, gain still greater significance, since, 
in spite of all efforts, only 4,000 men express themselves openly against it. I regard 
the monster petition, which was alike excellent in form and content, as an unmis- 
takable proclamation of the nation, as a fact in the history of civilization. Behind 
every signature stand atleast fifty who approve. And even if nothing practical is 
gained by it, we gain at least this: We know what backing we have among the 
people, among the learned and the practical, in the city and country population, in 
our efforts to improve the present schools. In fact, about 300 teachers in gymnasia, 
about 300 teachers in universities, about 300 clergymen, and about 1,500 physicians 
signed the petition. 
Whoever has signed his name once does not take it away, but brings others. So 
I think these 22,409 German men form a natural union for the further advancement 
of school reform. - 
- There are, it is true, many reform associations in Germany with similar aims; con- 
_ sidered fundamentally, they do not stand in hostile opposition to one another, but 
they bring different views of the same question to a clear expression; they are all 
united in this, that the condition of our higher schools can not remain as it now is, 
and that is the chief point. * * * 
We must first of all strive for this end: to elevate the instruction in German, in 
German history, literature, and knowledge of home. The subject really ought to 
stand in the very center of all studies. With the strengthened national feeling 
arising from the union of Germany, it is necessary to take account of this demand. 
Not that the number of hours of instruction in German must everywhere be in- 
creased at the expense of other branches, although I should hold that also very 
desirable, but first of all in all branches, and especially in the foreign languages, 
more attention must be paid to the speaking of German, and at every occasion, and 
especially in using the classical implements of culture, the advantages that our lan- 
guage possesses over the others must be brought forward. Attention must once 
more be paid to the history of its development, as was the case when I was still in 
Prima. Further, Germany must take the precedence of all other/lands in historical 
and geographical instruction. In the reading books and compositions exercises 
about foreign subjects must give place to home topics. The glorious history of the 
Hohenzollerns must be presented in the lowest classes, and faithfully repeated again 
and again. By this means love to the Fatherland and loyalty to the King will be 
early awakened and nourished. 
Next to a stronger emphasis of German we must aim at a physical development 
which shall rest upon physiological grounds, shall consider as much as possible the 
entire nature of man, and which shall bring with it a better school hygiene. The 
sphere is a large one, and sincea physiological pedagogy does not yet exist, the de- 
termination of the chief points—for example, how far school physicians are to c¢o- 
operate—still demands a great deal of labor. In like manner the succession of studies, 
the suitable alternation of gymnastics, singing, and drawing lessons with the more         
   
-P-A-G-E-369
  THE HIGHER SCHOOLS OF PRUSSIA. 341 
severe brain activity must be theoretically regulated as the case may demand. It 
must come to the point when from our schools there shall go forth not only cultured 
and healthy, but also alert, determined, skillful, muscularly strong young men in 
greater numbers than is now the case. The German race is distinguished above the 
Romanic in the last respect, and this inheritance must not be diminished by the 
schools. The material for the army must not be allowed to grow poorer in the-case 
of the one-year volunteers; and if not everyone of the latter can be an athlete, yet 
the crooked sitting, the wearing of spectacles, and the quite too frequent muscular 
weakness in this category can be combated with great effect in the earlier years. 
But, in order to break a path for these reforms, a better preparation of the teach- 
ers during their university studies is indispensable. Every student must have op- 
portunity for the lectures on the constitution of the body and intellect of those 
whom later as teacher and educator, even if only as father, he is to perfect as human 
beings in the fullest meaning of the word. The physiology and psychology of the 
child, and psychogenesis are, it is true, not yet fully differentiated as independent 
sciences, but they form the natural bases of every future system of pedagogy. In 
spite of the differences of individual development there are general laws of develop- 
ment and education of a physiological nature. 
A theologian, a philologist, a historian can not measure the fundamental import- 
ance of these requirements until he has made himself, to a certain extent, acquainted 
with them. Up to the present that has seldom been the case. No matter how often 
pedagogy is designated as a philosophical science, it actually is and remains applied 
physiology and applied empirical psychology, and truly of all the applied sciences 
the most complicated and difficult in application. For if we were in harmony as to 
the best principles and methods for directing the development of the child, so that 
he should develop into the most perfect man possible, we would have reached the 
highest point that any science can reach. But in order to discover those principles 
and methods the future teacher, before he enters upon his career, must become to 
some extent acquainted with the material upon which he is to exercise his influence, 
and that must be done in the seminaries. The physician investigates and treats the 
sick long before he begins to practice: Why should not the teacher, to a like de- 
gree, before he enters upon his practice instruct and train children? 
‘There must be in the future a greater participation of the parents in education, 
and especially in primary education. When their children are attending school they 
have the prime duty of lightening the difficult task of the schools in every possible 
manner, especially by increasing the respect of the child for the teacher, by pre- 
venting an overloading with private lessons, by strict discipline in the maintenance 
of good morals and the culture of the religious instinct, by keeping them away from 
the many enjoyments suitable only for adults, and from the strong influences of our 
modern life. In short, the parents must bring up their children in harmony with the 
schools. In exchange they may well claim as their right that they shall not always 
be compelled to have their sons study Greek and Latin nine long years, if they wish 
them to enter the service of the state or to have them educated for the profession 
of medicine. This right of the parents is a cardinal point in the whole question of 
school reform in its legislative aspects. 
The equalization of the humanistic gymnasia, the real-gymnasia, and the 
higher real-schools, at least that of the two first, with reference to qualifying for 
university studies is the single demand of the German Union of Real-Schoolmen, 
which has over 3,000 members, and has existed since 1875. This is a necessary con- 
dition for further and more thorough reforms and is demanded by warm friends of 
the old humanistic gymnasium. 
The number of graduates of real-gymnasia who learn Greek in a supplementary 
year or year and a half and then obtain the certificate of maturity of a humanistic 
gymnasium is ever increasing and the gymnasium is being circumvented in this 
manner. We must therefore come to the view that the humanistic gymnasia will 
 
-P-A-G-E-370
  B42. * EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
be damaged in case we continually force upon them material that is unsuitable, and 
the rezl-schools will retrograde because they have not.enough privileges. If the 
humanistic gyumasia could not stand this equalization in regard to external re- 
lations, then they surely would have outlived their-uscfulness. The state has need 
of an army of officials that has a much more intimate knowledge of the present and 
the real than of the Greek and Latin of antiquity. 
But it is not the intention that the humanistic gymnasia shall be gradually 
abolished. On the contrary, they must have an opportunity to show how capable 
they are of living without a monopoly, in free competition, and what they can aceom- 
plish if they return to the earlier and more classical organization that was retained till 
1882. Moreover it is intelligible that the demand for equal privileges for the old 
and new gymnasia finds many highly cultured opponents, for it is casily looked 
upon as a special interest of the Real-Schoolmen’s Union. It is indeed for the real- 
gymnasiwn a question of yital moment. These will perish without equal rights with 
the humanistic gymnasium, But the question is amuch deeper one than that of the 
prosperity of a hundred schools. Here the old and the new generations come into 
collision. Here the old ideas of an encyclopedical, cosmopolitan, old classical eul- 
ture, and the modern ideas of individual, practical, national education come together. 
The question is, shall only that man still pass for highly educated who is instructed 
according to the principles of the’ seventeenth century? Shall the study of dead 
languages still be given the preference? Shall the German still seek a better intel- 
lectual home in Athens and in Rome? Or shall, as we desire, the modern culture, 
corresponding to the present and to the truth, based upon scientific principles, be 
recognized by the state alongside of this other form of culture? Shall an old prejudice 
continue to be officially cherished, so that both kinds of gymnasia pine, or shall 
it fall, so that new life is put into both? All this lies in the demand for the just 
external equalization of the gymnasia and real-gymnasia. This equalization is 
already actually accomplished in popular opinion. A graduate of the real-gymmnasi- 
um with the grade “excellent” in the chief branches is in fact better educated than 
a graduate of the humanistic gymnasium who just gets through. 
A-simplification of the examinations will also be necessary, both for the Raitaas 
and the teachers, in different directions, in the final examinations, of the gym- 
nasia, in the examinations for the privilege of one-year volunteer service, in the 
examination for head masters, for admission to the study of medicine and other pro- 
fessions, in order that the judgment may not be injured by overburdening the mem- 
ory. * * * As a further aim of the school-reform agitation we must keep before 
us a greater independence in the administration of education and a greater partici- 
pation of specialists. The ministry for spiritual, educational, and medicinal affairs 
is-too large. A single man, even the most gifted, can not direct it continuously in 
all its parts with the same thoroughness. In a state like Prussia, containing large 
numbers of both Catholics and Protestants, the oftentimes very troublesome eccle- 
siastical affairs, the schools, from the common schools to the universities, and the 
-eare of the public health,—to know and to further all this is at present too much for 
one minister. Therefore suggestions have often been made for the establishment 
of a ministry of education. It will come to that in the future. * * * If the 
church and the schools, which formerly were united, have taken divergent courses 
of development, then a corresponding division of labor at the center of government 
will have to be introduced, and the sooner the better. It is a matter of course that 
experienced schoolmen should coiperate in an important way; but it does not seem 
to be necessary that the minister of education himself should be a schoolman. He 
might be a lawyer, or a physician, especially if the health department remains 
“to be combined with the department of education. * *

may be presupposed. It will offer a common central point for the present agitation 
for school reform, and unite the parties which seem to stand opposed to one another

the principles according to which education naturally shapes itself and makes itself 
correspond to the spirit of the science of to-day. It will therefore exalt the value of 
the modern sciences for education and instruction. It will take the ground that in- 
struction in education and teaching must have an independent position in the higher 
schools, and that a suitable pedagogical training, not merely a training in aspecialty, 
must fall to the share of every high-school teacher. We demand at the same time 
that only teachers educated for educating shall approach German youth; for such 
only can ely watch over them, and protect them from those injuries that, in the 
shape of pedagogical misconceptions and hygienie errors of all kinds, injure the 
young, etc.    
   
  IL.—Tue ConFERENCE OF DECEMBER, 1890. 
Preliminaries.—In 1849 the Prussian minister of education, Von 
Ladenberg, called together in Berlin a school conference for fixing gen- 
eral standards of instruction, to which were summoned the directors and — 
instructors of gymnasia and real-schools. In October, 1873, another 
conference was held at the same place, likewise under the auspices of | 
the minister of education. Neither of these meetings had any immediate 
practical results, but their debates were published and furnished most 
valuable material and wholesome incentives to the people. ‘These 
foreign governments,” says Arnold, “which we think so offensively 
arbitrary, do at least take—when they administer education—the best
-P-A-G-E-372
            344 EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
educational opinions of the country into their councils, and we do not.” 
It was, therefore, not without precedent, and quite in accordance with 
the principles that had always prevailed in Prussia, that the Prussian 
minister of education, Von Gossler, should summon a conference com- 
posed of experienced schoolmen to diseuss the questions agitating the 
public and to establish principles that should serve as the basis of 
practical legislation. The idea of uniting the greatest opponents in 
the school question was first mentioned by the minister on the 18th of 
March, 1890, On the 20th of March he added that it was his intention 
to unite typical representatives of different tendencies, not with the 
idea that they would destroy each other, increase the confusion, and 
finally conclude that it was best to let things stay as they were, but in 
order that they might freely express their opinions to each other in a 
commission governed by parliamentary rules, instead of in great popular 
assemblages, Details of the plan were not made public until the fol- 
lowing October. On the 18th of October the educational minister 
issued an order directed to the different royal departments, and to the 
royal provincial school colleges at Berlin, which contained, among 
; others, the following doeuments: 
  ORDER OF THE FIRST OF MAY, 1889. 
T have for a long time been occupied with the thought of making use of the schools 
in their separate grades for combating the spread of socialistic and communistic 
- ideas. The prime object of the schools will ever be to lay the foundations for a 
sound comprehension of both civic and social relations by cherishing reverence for 
God and love for the Fatherland. But I can not fail to recognize that in a time 
when the errors and misrepresentations of social democracy are spread abroad with 
increased zeal, the school is called upon to make increased efforts to advance the 
recognition of the true, the real, and the possible in the world. The school must 
endeavor to create in the young the conviction that the teachings of social democ- 
racy contradict not only the Divine commands and Christian morals, but are more- 
over impracticable, and in their consequences destructive alike to the individual 
and to the community. The school must bring the new and the newest history of 
the times more than hitherto into the circle of the subjects of instruction, and show 
that the power of the State alone can protect for the individual his family, his free- 
dom, and his rights. And it must bring the youth to know how Prussia’s kings 
have exerted themselves to elevate the condition of the laborers in a continuous de- 
velopment from the legal reforms of Frederick the Great and from the abolition of 
serfdom to the present day. Moreover, the school must show by statistics how con- 
siderably and constantly in this century the wages and condition of the laboring 
classes have improved under this monarchical protection. 
In order to come nearer to this goal, I count upon the complete codperation of my 
ministry of state, and while calling upon it to take the matter into further considera- 
tion, and to make tome definite propositions, I wish torecommend the following points 
for special consideration: 
(1) Will it be necessary in order to make the instruction in religion more fruitful 
in the sense indicated to bring the ethical side of the same into the foreground and 
to limit the memory work to what is absolutely necessary ? 
(2) The history of the Fatherland, and especially also the history of our social, 
economic, and legislative development from the beginning of-this century to the 
 
-P-A-G-E-373
\ 
THE HIGHER SCHOOLS OF PRUSSIA. 345 
present social and political legislation will especially need to be treated in order to 
show how the monarchs of Prussia have from the earliest times considered it as their 
special duty to grant to the population engaged in manual labor their paternal protec- 
tion, and to advance their physical and intellectual welfare, and how also in the future 
the laborers have to expect justice and security in their earnings only under the pro- 
tection and the care of the king at the head of an organized State. From the stand- 
point of utility, especially by the presentation of striking practical conditions, it 
can easily be made cli to the youth that a regulated government with a secure 
  monarchical direction is the indispensable prerequisite for the protection and pros- 
perity of the individual in his civil and industrial relations; that on the contrary, the 
teachings of social democracy are not practical, and, if they were, would subject the 
freedom of the individual to an unendurable constraint even in his domestic life. 
The pretended ideals of the socialists are sufficiently characterized by their own ex- 
planations to be made repulsive to the sensibilities and the practical sense even of 
youth. 
(3) It is self-evident that the duty falling upon-the schools in consequence must 
be suitably limited according to the scope and purpose of the different grades of 
schools, that only the most simple and easily comprehended relations can be pre- 
sented to the children in the common schools, while for the higher categories of 
educational institutions the task is to be correspondingly broadened and deepened. 
It will be especially necessary to qualify the teachers to enter upon the new duty 
with deyotion and to carry it through with practical skill. To this end the insti- 
tutions for preparing teachers will need to undergo a corresponding enlargement in 
their organization. 
I do not fail to recognize what difficulties will obstruct the performance of this 
task and that a long experience 1s necessary m order to determine what is right in 
all particulars. But this consideration should not prevent us from advancing the 
aecomplishment of an object whose realization, according to my conviction, is of 
the highest importance for the welfare of the Fatherland. The ministry of state will 
accordingly set under way the necessary discussions, and after the termination of 
the same will report to me. 
CAsTLE IN BERLIN, May 1, 1889, 
      
WitriaMm R. 
PRINCE VON BISMARCK. 
To the MINISTRY OF STATE. 
_ The ministry of state, in a conference on the 27th of July, agreed 
upon definite proposals for carrying out the Emperor’s wishes. The 
following are the propositions concerning the higher school system: 
(1) In relation to the instruction in religion, regulations are to be issued for all 
classes of higher schools in the sense of the imperial order of the 1st of May, 1889. 
It must be enjoined upon the higher schools, especially upon the gymnasia, that 
the religious instruction is to be so imparted that emphasis shall be laid upon the 
living acceptation and the inward appropriation of the facts of salvation and the 
Christian duties, and special attention be given to the apologetic and ethical side. 
Along with considerable diminution in the amount taught, especially by eutting out 
the history of church and dogma leading to the taking sides in religious controver- 
sies, the instruction, so far as it is based on history, is to be limited to the oceur- 
rences of enduring significance for the ecclesiastical and religious life. The appro- 
priate department of the educational administration will be engaged with the subject 
of instruction in the Catholic religion. 
(2) In regard to instruction in history, regulations are to be issued for all classes of 
higher schools in the sense of the imperial order of Ist of May, 1889. 
(a) The instruction in the history of the Fatherland is to be carried down to the 
                               
-P-A-G-E-374
  846 EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
beginning of the reign of His Majesty and is to be extended beyond its former com- 
pass from the time of the Great Elector. 
(b) The more important facts are to be introduced as early-as the middle classes 
of the higher institutions. 
(¢) In the instruction in history the Gevalia of our social and economic con- 
ditions, especially from the beginning of this century to the present social and po- 
litical legislation (care for the aged and invalid, 1889), is to be presented. 
(d) This instruction is to be more extensive in the senior class of the complete insti- 
- tutions. In this connection theinstruction concerning the destructiveness of social 
democracy is to ensue through and by means of a healthy understanding, without 
entering upon a detailed discussion of the socialistic theories. The impossibility 
of the social democratic effortsis to be demonstrated by the positive objects of social 
‘democracy, and to be put in intelligible shape for youthful minds. 
(e) In consequence of the expansion of the historical instruction provided for in 
(a) to (@) the remaining material for historical instruction will be correspondingly 
diminished. 
(f) The historical text-books are to be completed by suitable men by adding-the 
corresponding material. 
a (3) “Emphasis is to be laid upon the carrying out of the principle that history and 
~ literature are not to be explained in a formal and mnemonic fashion, but ethically and 
with reference to their essential meaning. 
(4) The regulation for examining candidates for higher school positions is to be 
revised in the sense of the preceding provisions. 
(5) In the practical preparation of the teachers (pedagogical seminaries, trial 
years, etc.) particular attention is to be paid to the preceding regulations. 
By an order of the 30th of August, 1889, the king approved these 
proposals and recommended the minister of education to take the nec- 
essary steps for revising the school system in accordance with the 
same. 
_ The order proceeds as follows: 
In accordance with the above the duty falls upon the higher school system, in a 
more effective pursuit of its former objects, not only to equip those social classes 
that are called to exercise a critical influence upon the entire life of our people with 
the knowledge necessary to produce such results, but also to give them, by means 
of an education based upon Christianity and the national German spirit, a perma- 
nent tendency of the will and of the character. Therefore, above all, those subjects 
of instruction which are calculated to determine immediately the sensibility and 
will are to be employed to the greatest extent possible. Along with these duties com- 
mon to all higher schools, the goals fixed for individual classes of schools are to be 
kept firmly in view. If, however, in this, not merely a more highly cultured per- 
sonality, but also an intellectually composed and a morally confirmed personality is 
everywhere striven for as the result of the instruction, then all the scientific work 
of the higher schools will serve tho ends of true education. This is universally recog- 
  nized, but different views prevail as to the way that should be taken to reach this 
goal, and these views are in part contradictory. Therefore it has been recommended 
to ascertain through the joint deliberations of men of different positions in life 
which of the numerous proposals for improving our school system are justified and 
how the same are to be equalized, especially, however, how they are to be made 
available for school forms that have come down to us through history. 
His Majesty the King has been pleased most graciously to approve such a delib- 
eration, and preparations for the same are at present being made; as soon as the re- 
sults are presented it will be considered in what manner and in what-degree they 
are to be applied in shaping the programmes of the higher schools.

In addition to the above the following representatives of the different 
government departments attended the conference and nos part in its 
proceedings, but did not vote: ; 
From the ministry of spiritual, educational, and medicinal affairs, 
Drs. de la Croix, Schneider, Staunder, Wehrenpfenning, Bohtz, Althoff, 
H6pfner, and Képke; from the war ministry, Major Fleck, Dr. Wer- 
ner, staff surgeon, Dr. Rehrmann, professor in the cadet school in Gross 
_Lichterfeld; from the ministry for trade and industry, Privy Coun- 
cilor Liiders; from the ministry of finance, Privy Councilor Germar; 
from the ministry for agriculture, domains, and forests, Dr. Thiel; and 
Director Matzat of the agricultural school at Weilburg. 
It is not surprising that the ardent agitators for school reform, who 
had been led by the attitude of the ministry to expect a great deal from 
the Berlin conference, were no less disappointed than surprised when 
the above list was made public. They considered it ‘a packed confer- 
ence.” Whatever hopes they may have entertained they, for the most 
part, abandoned before the sittings of the conference began. Popular 
interest had been aroused and sustained by the expectation that at last 
important and radical changes were at hand, The friends and adyo- 
eates of more modernized education were full of hope. The supporters 
of the old gymnasium were not free from apprehension. At last all 
parties were to have an official hearing, and the fittest would have a 
chance at least of surviving. As soon, however, as the constitution of 
the conference became public popular interest almost died out. “In 
fact, the lists of names and of questions contain the decision,” were the 
vords of an ardent advocate of the gymnasium. There could be no 
question as to the result. The list contained at least fourteen repre- 
sentatives of the strict gymnasial tendencies who differed from each 
other in their views as to the necessity of reform in the gymnasium, 
but were united in opposition to the real-gymnasiuin and its privileges. 
Dr. Eitner, of Gérlitz, and Dr. Matthias, of Diisseldorf, directors of

combined institutions, were to be counted with them. Opposed to these 
fourteen or sixteen champions of the gymnasial standpoint were three — 
representatives of real educational institutions, Dr. Schauenburg, Dr. 
Schlee, Dr. Fiedler. 
Dr. Hornemann, Dr. Albrecht, and Dr. Holzmiiller were all well- 
known opponents of the real institutions. All the most prominent 
representatives of the real-gymnasia, as, for example, Steinbart, 
Schwalbe, Schmeding, Krumme in Brunswick, and Dillman in Stutt- 
gart, and Prof. Preyer in Berlin, were not summoned. All members 
of the congressional committee on education who had spoken in favor 
of the equalization of the real-gymnasia, like Seyffardt, Schmelzer, and 
Arendt, were also missing. On the other hand, the deputies Graf and. 
Kropatschek, who had always opposed the wishes of the real-school, 
were included. There was one mathematician—Holzmiiller, he a de- 
clared opponent,of the real-gymnasia; no naturalist, unless we count 
the physicians as such; no teacher in a technical high school; no ar- 
tist; one architect; no engineer; no forester; no merchant; one man- 
ufacturer, and one mine-owner. The association of real-school men 
had good reason to complain; its most violent opponents were sum- 
moned, and its chief advocates were not. Much might be expected, 
however, in the way of such reforms as did not involve a seriouschange 
in school organization. Schenkendorf, Hitner, and others might be ex- 
pected to advocate warmly the cause of physical culture. Frick and 
Schiller would take ground for a pedagogical preparation of teachers. 
There was ground to hope that some measure would be taken against 
overpressure and. the causes of near-sightedness. There was lamenta- 
tion that no one appeared to plead the cause of drawing and art in the 
gymnasium. Some practical improvements in existing institutions 
might be expected from such a commission, but no radical changes. 
The friends of the new German school, however, expected little; and , 
they would have been less disappointed than they were but for the 
energetic interference of the Emperor. 
Order of business.—The order of business was as follows: 
1, The convention has the object of affording to the administration 
of education by its proceedings concerning the questions specified in 
the programme in regard to the higher school system standards for 
judging the same. 
2, The minister of education, or a deputy appointed by him, presides. 
3. The proceedings extend, excluding a general debate, to each in- 
dividual group of the questions presented, and will be introduced by 
the report’ of one or several reporters or referees. 
4, The referees will be appointed by the chairman; the number of 
the same for each group depends upon his judgment. 
5. The reports of the referees will, as briefly as possible, give a con- 
densed survey of the views and demands coming under consideration. 
They must contain precise motions corresponding to the questions pro- 
posed.

speakers, and has the right to make, in advance, regulations as to the 
length of individual speeches and to close the proceedings when the 
subject of discussion appears to him exhausted. 
8. As a rule, one speaker shall not have the floor more than once for 
each individual question. Exceptions are allowable only with the ap-

11. A stenographic report will be made of the proceedings, which, 
after it has been transcribed, will be expesed to view of the members 
in the bureau. The speeches will be presented to the speakers for 
revision before they are finally included in the report. The latter are 
bound to give their speeches to the bureau in the forenoon following 
the day of the proceedings. 
12. During the proceedings the members are to preserve a strict 
Secrecy regarding the same and are not to allow reports to come to the 
‘public press, either from themselves or others. 
- 18. The chairman determines whether and how far during the pro- 
ceedings a short summary of its progress is to be made public. 
14, At the close of the proceedings the chairman decides whether 
the same shall be made public complete according to the stenographie 
report or in extracts or in a summary. 
~ 15. The minutes and printed matter coming up in the course of the 
proceedings will be given to the convention, one copy to each member, 
for the purpose of using them in his work. 
_ The questions submitted to the conference were as follows: 
1, Are the varieties of high schools existing to-day to be maintained 
in their present separation, or is it advisable to unite (a) the gymna- 
sium and the real-gymnasium, (b) the real-gymnasium and the higher 
real-school? 
2. Can a common foundation be provided for the three existing 
classes of schools (gymnasia, real-gymnasia, schools without Latin) 
or for two of the same? In the latter case is it recommended (a) to 
extend the existing uniformity for the three lower classes of the gym- 
-hasia and real-gymnasia to Lower Secunda (inclusive), and to intro- 
- duce from Upper Secunda upwards the study plan of the higher 
_ real-school? (This is providing for a combination of the real-gymna- 
sium with the gymnasium.) (b) Or to push forward Latin in the real- 
gymnasium to Lower Tertia, and toe amplify the three lower classes
-P-A-G-E-379
      
ty THE HIGHER SCHOOLS OF PRUSSIA. 3540. 
that do not study Latin into a higher burgher school? (This is providing 
for a combination of the real-gymnasium with the higher burgher school.) 
‘3. Is it advisable to reduce the number of hours devoted to the an- 
cient languages in the study plan of the gymnasia, and so to make 
it possible to reduce the total number of hours of instruction in the 
three lower classes, to introduce English as an elective study, and to ~ 
make drawing obligatory above Quarta? 
Should Latin composition as a prime accomplishment, and the writ-- 
ten translation of Greek be dropped in Prima at the same time that 
this reduction of hours is introduced? 
4, Is it advisable to retain in the study plan of the real-gymnasium 
the increased amount of Latin introduced in the year 1882, or should a- 
lessening of the same and thereby a reduction in the total number of 
school hours be brought about? 
5. Is it advisable (a) in places where there are only gymnasia or 
real gymnasia to introduce instead of Latin an increased amount of in- 
struction in German and modern foreign languages, according to the 
local needs; () in places where there are only high schools that do not 
teach Latin, to add to their three lower classes according to local needs 
instruction in Latin; (¢ ye to reduce all institutions with seven grades 
(progymnasia, real- -progymnasia, real schools) to institutions with six . 
grades; (d) to shape alike the study-plan of the real-schools and the 
higher burgher schools, and to arrange both so that without prejudice 
to the different, methodical treatment of the subjects of instruction and 
to the termination of the course of education, the continuation of the 
same in the higher real-school shall be made easier? 
6. Is it advisable to introduce in those institutions that are arranged 
with a course of study running through nine years an earlier relative 
termination after the sixth year of the course in the interest of the 
scholars that enter into practical life before the completion of the nine 
years’ course? Be 
7. Are further or new standards desirable for the furthering of sue- 
cessful education, with regard to the maximum size of the classes, the 
number of scholars and of classes allowed in each institution, the com- 
plete division of Tertia and Secunda in two classes, according to years, © 
and the number of hours of duty of the teacher?

13. What changes seem advisable in the privileges (a) of the insti- 
tutions with a course of study extending over nine years, (b) in the 
higher burgher schools (to be discussed according to the different em- 
ployments). 
14. If in the future the right to one-year service can be obtained 
earlier in the higher burgher schools than in the other higher schools by 
reason of the earlier termination of their course of study, and changes 
are introduced for the benefit of the higher burgher schools in regard to 
other privileges, then the need for this class of schools will increase. 
What general rules shall be adopted for meeting this demand? (Com- 
bination of higher burgher schools with existing institutions, transfor- 
mation of a part of the latter, building of new higher burgher schools 
by the state or with state support.) 
      THE, 
  ES OF THE RE 
  EREES: DR. GORING’S VIEWS. 
  The minister of education assigned these questions to different mem- 
bers of the conference to report upon, and the members so appointed 
prepared theses containing a summary of their conclusions. These 
theses were handed in to the minister before the conference assembled. 
and by his order printed fox the convenience of the members. In the 
main they were brief summaries in regard to the technical points at 
issue, each referee confining himself to a few short paragraphs. Dr. 
Goring, however, the representative of the Association for School Re- 
form in the conference, apparently took advantage of the opportunity 
afforded to present his views on the entire educational system, although 
the question assigned him to report upon, the eighth, was one that 
apparently offers little scope for wide digressions. Dr. Géring is the 
author of a scheme for anew German school that has attracted no little 
attention, and for carrying out which considerable sums have already 
been subscribed. It seems worth while therefore, ‘to give his thesis 
in full: 
1. The entire instruction must further independent thinking, must lead to a moral 
and religious culture, aid the development of character, strengthen the will, exercise 
faney and memory in the right proportion, sharpen the senses by a far-reaching 
use of material for object lessons, and avoid all that injures the physical welfare 
of the scholar. 
2. Care is to be taken therefore that the knowledge of the scholar has a symmet- 
rical coherence. It becomes thereby a moral power and tends to free the charac- 
ter from hesitancy and indifference in judging moral questions and in acting accord- 
ing to moral principles. 
3. The same amount of time must be allowed for the recreations of the scholar as_ 
for his work, and in sneh a manner that the afternoon remains free for gymnastic 
exercises and exercises in manual training, and that the association of the scholar 
       
       
-P-A-G-E-381
    - THE HIGHER SCHOOLS OF PRUSSIA. 353 
with his family and with companions of the same age is not too much limited by 
home exercises. 
‘4, All subjects of instruction are to be arranged connegtellly: and such prepara- 
tions are to be made for every new subject that the scholars shall approach it with 
interest and as much natural eagerness as possible. In regard to the chief subject of 
the gymnasium, the Latin language, this objectis difficult of attainmentin the lower 
élasses, since a dead language cannot be made interesting to a boy of 9 years without 
the stimulus of artificial conceptions. 
5. The independent activity of the scholar is to be increased by allowing him to 
find out the facts of science for himself so far as this is possible through reflection. 
Systematic lectures by teachers are to be avoided. : 
6. Limits are to be set to that sort of activity which dulls the interest of the scholar 
and forces him to external appropriation of the subject matter; namely, learning-by 
heart. 
7. Every teacher must become accurately acquainted with the contents of his 
pupils’ minds before introducing them to his subject, in order that he may build on 
to the existing knowledge and make what is already known the starting point for 
the treatment of the new subject. 
8. All teachers of a class after the close of the day’s instruction must determine 
the subjects and lessons for the following school day in a general deliberation and 
upon the ground of the amount accomplished in each branch, in order that one sub- 
ject may stand in due relation to another. 5 
9. The combination of the individual branches of instruction into a symmetrical 
organization is naturally accomplished by intrusting the entire instruction in each 
of the lower classes to one teacher. Unusually capable teachers should accompany 
their scholars from class to class, at least to the close of Quarta (singing, gymnastics, 
and manual training excepted). 
* The execution of this demand can not meet with difficulty on account of any ignor- 
ance of the teachers, for the total amount of knowledge. possessed by a pupil in 
Sexta, Quinta, or Quarta is so small that any academically educated teacher can 
easily master it. . 
By transferring the entire instruction in each class to the kands of one teacher it 
will be made possible to have the instruction proceed from one symmetrical con- 
sciousness and to form again in the scholara single symmetrical consciousness. This 
advantage possessed by the common schools through having a single teacher for 
each class can be gained also for the gymnasium. 
The methodic training of future teachers in pedagogical seminaries will lighten 
and give artistic form to this method of instruction. 
The additional work that would fall upon a gymnasial teacher gives no ground for 
declining this proposal. The tasks that are imposed on a boy can in no way over- 
load aman. We must consider also the number of hours a teacher in the common 
schools requires for guiding his class in all the branches of instruction. The ele- 
mentary subjects are not easier than the subjects taught in gymnasiums in respect 
to the demands made upon the teachers. Rather the ease of instruction increases 
with the higher scientific interest that the subjects excite. 
Besides, the work of a gymnasial teacher does not always Det the full strength 
of aman. 
An increase in the work of teaching would limit the literary activity of teachers 
rich in leisure. 
The carrying ont of this demand brings the advantage that teaching power will 
be gainéd and the number of scholars in the classes can be diminished. 
From that will arise the blessing that the individuality of the scholar can be care- 
fully studied by the teacher, and that the scholars form a firm moral bond with the 
teacher. The special teacher often gives instruction in so many classes that it is not 
possible for him to penetrate into the nature of the scholars, Overloading of the 
ED 90. 23,   
   
-P-A-G-E-382
  354 ‘ EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. = 
scholars is excluded by this means of instruction, since the teacher always knows 
what the scholar has to do in all subjects. 
- This method of instruction must also abolish that certificate of poverty of the 
system of higher instruction, the hour for assistance. 
The one-sidedness in the influence of one teacher upon the pupils is not so harmful 
as the dissipation of the scholars’ consciousness through the system of special teach- 
ers, and it will be lessened by association with parents and comrades. 
10. All teachers are under obligations to occupy themselves in the’study of peda- 
gogical writings, which furnish them landmarks for the development of a good 
method. 
_ Every teacher must also make himself acquainted with the principles of hygiene 
and general physiology in order that he may in general, without calling a physician, 
keep the scholars free from injuries to health, The pedagogical preparation of 
teachers must in the future embrace these subjects. 
11. Religious instruction is to be regarded as the central point of all instruction. 
_ All the other branches are to be taught with reference to’ this one. In it is to be 
sought the material source of a more intensive instruction. 
12. In the lower gymnasial classes the chief emphasis is to be laid upon the nar- 
rative books of the New Testament in such a manner that they may be thoroughly 
understood and may make 4 real religious impression. At this point the learning 
by heart of biblical proverbs and sacred songs is to be avoided. Nothing is to be 
memorized except the Commandments, so that the entire religious instruction may 
fall inside the school, and there may be no trace of compulsion or mere memory work 
but that the recurring lesson may operate only to build up the character, sensibilities, 
-and disposition of the boy. 
The life of Jesus is to become the center of the boy’s conceptions and must be 
presented to his mind in an elevated and inspiring fashion. The historical books of 
the Old Testament are to be read from the school Bible in Sexta and Quinta, in 
Quarta the doctrinal books of the New Testament, and in connection therewith the 
Psalms and Job. 
Instruction concerning the existing laws of the land, political economy, and the 
care of the health belongs in the religious instruction, 
» 13. As religion gives the divine type, so German poetry is to be regarded as the 
second subject in importance, since it represents the human pattern.. In connection 
with religion poetry is to be treated in the lessons in history, geography, and natu- 
ral history. Each one of these branches offers opportunities to illustrate some sub- 
ject by apoem. Methodically arranged books of poetry are sufticient for school 
uses. In this subject also learning by heart is to be avoided in Sexta and Quinta, 
It is sufficient that the instruction in singing impresses on the memory the songs that 
the scholars sing. In this way singing is connected with the chief branches, since 
in the singing lessons the songs to be sung are explained, among them religious 
songs, chorals, and patriotic songs. Memorizing is made much easier by singi 
14. The entire instruction in, German broadens the moral and xeligious conceptions 
of the boy by the reading of statements from religion, human life, political economy, 
history, geography, the animal world, the plant world, the mineral kingdom, and 
science. These materials for reading prepare for the instruction in these various 
subjects, and the ideas thus gathered the teacher, by many kinds of object lessons, 
by experiments, and by systematic instruction, shapes into a coherent ideal. 
In reading in the classes accurate tests should be made as to how far the subject 
matter is understood. The scholars must grasp connected readings and learn to 
- understand books in order that they may edweate themselves by private reading, in 
case that becomes necessary. The teacher, too, must always indicate the connection 
of what is read with the moral and religious center of the instruction, in order that 
as early as possible the danger of disconnected, indiscriminate reading may be pre- 
vented. 
     
-P-A-G-E-383
  THE HIGHER SCHOOLS OF PRUSSIA, 355 
The scholars must read with expression, following the example of the teacher. At 
the same time they are not always to be confined to their reading book, but are to 
be accustomed to follow and understand matter read to them by the teacher or a 
scholar out of a book brought into the class by the teacher. 
Independent, logical, and grammatically correct speech is to be aimed at. The 
scholars are to be admonished from lesson to lesson to express themselves extempo- 
raneously in connected fashion, and moreover outside of their seats, facing the class. 
They will speak only concerning that which has been thoroughly treated in the class. 
German exercises are to be prepared in school. A theme is never to be given 
for a composition whose substance is not thoroughly understood by the scholar. A 
composition can be written every week. The copying in clean handwriting alone is 
to be done at home or in the writing lesson. In this ‘way the German composition 
becomes the most important aid in carrying through methodical instruction. The 
German composition represents the results of the work in all other branches. 
Grammar is never to be treated in any other way than in connection with reading 
and conversation. From Sexta to Quarta a text-book of grammar is to be kept at a 
distance. The home work is to remain completely free from grammatical exercises, 
The learning by heart of poems and prose is to be left in general to the free will 
ofthe scholar. One short narrative poem that has been treated in the lessons can 
be memorized monthly. The scholars are to aid the teacher in testing what has 
been learned. - 
At the close of each school half-year a dramatic representation corresponding to | 
the age and understanding shall be given by each class. All the participants are to 
volunteer for this work, which has the object of aceustoming the scholars to good 
artistic delivery and to considering a work of art as a whole. 
15. History occupies the third chief position in regard to forming moral and 
religious ideas, since it furnishes a picture of mankind in its actual existence, along 
with the ideal pictures of humanity presented by religion and poetry. 
The memorizing of historical tales is unconditionally to be avoided in the lower 
classes; this carried to excess makes instruction in history a caricature. It may” 
be agreeable to the teacher, but it brings sorrow and vexation to the scholar, with- 
out any gain in culture. Character sketches of historical personages are to prepon- 
derate. The most comprehensive use of object material is always to be made. 
These bridge over the abyss between the contemplation of the present and of a far 
remote past, and aid the comprehension. Such are pictures of persons, buildings, 
landscapes, occurrences, and geographical orientation on the map. 
_ The history of recent and of the most recent times.is to be given the preference. 
Books are to be read in Quinta and Quarta that depict the life of the German emperor. 
Instruction in history refers in turn to the religious instruction through the 
comparison of historical characters with religious characters, Especially is every 
action to be judged according to its moral and religious worth, after the standard of 
the life and works of Jesus. That will form firm fundamental ideas, and will 
strengthen the religious and moral judgment. 
16. The scholar is to be led to the study of Latin through a union of all the inter- 
ests that he has acquired through his knowledge of the Roman Empire. In the les- 
sons in religion the scholar has heard of the interference of the mighty Ronfan 
Empire in the history of Palestine. Much that is characteristic of the Roman Empire 
and the Roman people is connected with the birth, life, teachings, and death of Jesus. 
The scholar has further references to the history ef Rome from his recollection of 
Old Testament stories, from German history, from the instruction in geography, from 
the monuments of the Romans, and from the remains of the Roman language in Ger- 
man words and phrases. Roman history must be presented to the scholar in its 
_charactefistic features before his interest can be awakened for the Latin language. 
The instruction in Latin must be joined with connected reading. From this the 
forms and syntax are to be developed. : 
       
-P-A-G-E-384
      356 BDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
- Jn this also the chief labor can be transferred to the schools, by employing in each 
‘lesson the new material that the teacher-has-offered in Latin and has had the schol- 
ars find out in practice sentences. The sentences are at first to be practiced orally; 
afterwards sentences will be written by each scholar on the blackboard in Latin, 
which the teacher has given in German. Finally, the scholar writes in every lesson 
_ in his copy book one or two Latin sentenees which the teacher has given in German. 
The scholars correct their faults, after {discussing the sentence. They aid tho 
teacher in this work by correcting each other’s books. 
The home work consists only in impressing firmly the few new svords which will 
be given to the scholars in each lesson. 
A grammar of the Latin language is not to be allowed before Tertia is reached. 
The scholars will deduce the rules from reading the extemporization and the» em- 
pirical material, and will impress them by exercises. 
The attention directed to the blackboard is hygienically favorable since it re- 
- quiivs the scholars to sit erect and practices them in seeing at a distance. 
17. The instruction in Greek is to be carried on in the same manner. 
18. In the modern languages exercises in conversation are to preponderate in the 
first year. 
19. Natural history and natural science are to be limited to what is typical. In 
these all depends upon individual observation and experience. The instruction in 
_ the same is connected with religion by the demonstration of God as the Creator and 
Preserver of all. In the study of animals sympathy for animals is to be awakened. 
as a command of Christianity. _ 
20. Geography is to be limited to the reading of sketches characterizing the dif- 
ferent lands and is to use object material as much as possible. The use and copy- 
ing of maps must be practiced constantly. The latter falls under the head of 
instruction in drawing. 
21. Arithmetic and later mathematics are to be treated with reference to the prov- 
erb, “All is arranged with reference to mass, number, and weight.” From these 
subjects the scholar derives the conception of objective truth and that the laws of 
morals have an absolute justice. By this means the religious and moral under- 
standing will be strengthened. 2 
Arithmetic and mathematics start from the observation of bodies and go from the 
concrete to the abstract—number, point, line. The rational preparation for this 
process of thinking is furnished by the Froebel system of games. 
Home work is excluded. 
22. Drawing gives the scholar opportunity to make experiences about the size re- 
lations of planes and their relations to bodies, and thereby affords the basis in ob- 
servation for planimetry and stereometry. Home work is excluded. 
23, Hand exercises may not be merely mechanical, but must be practiced after 
Froebel’s method? 
24. Gymnastics, youthful games, and singing must cement a firm bond between 
all the scholars. 
25. The transfer of the chief work to the school brings with it a limitation of the 
instruction to what is most important and typical, increases the independent activ- 
ity 6f the scholar, sharpens his attention and presence of mind, concentrates his 
thoughts, excites his curiosity, and increases his feeling of power and independence. 
The teacher has always an oversight as to the true capacity of the scholar, which is 
not always the case where work is done at home. 
26. All future teachers in high schools are to be methodically prepared. 
OPENING OF THE CONFERENCE.

cisions, was furnished to the press from day to day. After the con-

clusion of the proceedings, however, the stenographic report was 
published, making a volume of 800 octavo pages. It is obviously im- 
possible even to condense this vast amount of, for the main part, most 
interesting pedagogical material into so co a space as is furnished 
by the compass of this chapter. We will attempt to show only the main 
movements and tendencies in the conference, together with some of 
the most memorable utterances of the distinguished educators present,’ 
and finally the decisions arrived at, with their significance, and the 
impression they made on the public of Prussia. 
The first sitting was opened by Dr. von Gossler, minister of educa: 
tion, in the presence of the Emperor, in the Follarpitie words: 
May Your Majesty allow me surely from the heart and in the name of all present 
to express our most respectful and deepest felt thanks for the warm interest which 
you manifest in the education of our youth, 
In this respect Your Majesty is treading in the footsteps of your enlightened an- 
cestors. The Hohenzollerns have always regarded it as their right, but also as their 
duty, to influence immediately and decisively the development and education of the 
young. As early as the year 1573, your enlightened ancestor, John George, issued 
the celebrated visitation and consistorial decree, which determined for centuries 
the destiny of the schools of Brandenburg. At the close of his active life 
Elector Frederick William the Great issued the famous school order of Bran-— 
denburg, and moreover upon Lutheran foundations. His grandson, Frederick Wil- 
liam I, issued in the first year of his beneficent reign the cabinet and school de- 
cree, which formed the basis of the system of education down to and into the 
present century. He cared for the schools unweariedly to the close of his rich 
life, and. that which he did for the common schools still holds good in the Proy- 
ince of Prussia to-day. In his instructions for the Lutheran higher consistories’ 
Frederick the Great followed in the footsteps of his father. In 1763 he issued the 
celebrated general school regulation, and that which he had planned for the 
higher sghools became law a year after his death in the well-known instructions 
for the higher school board. At that time there was accomplished in Prussia for 
the first time, as a type for all lands, a careful separation of the provinces of the 
school and the church in the realm of education. But our entire Prussian educa- 
tional administration and legislation rests upon the famous cabinet order of Your 
Majesty’s most illustrious great grandfather. This unfortunately too-little-known 
order of the year 1817 summoned the whole nation, in a really inspiring manner, to 
codperate in the education of the young. The great deeds that Prussia accomplished 
under the leadership of her King proclaimed that the powers of the nation were pre- 
ponderatingly intellectual and ideal, and that only through a revival of the whole 
intellectual tenor of the people could that strength be obtained that secured to 
Prussia her lofty, but at the same time dangerous, position. As at that time Frede- 
rick William III summoned all classes of the people to codperate in the revival of 
the nation, so has Your Majesty also in the memorable order of the Ist of May of last 
year summoned us, declared the schools competent and intended to codperate in the 
revival of the people in those spheres which through the power of subversive in- 
fluences have been brought into question. Your Majesty has not failed to recognize 
that the work of the school is indeed the most powerful, but at the same time the 
slowest and most wearisome, and that the beginning must be made with the teacher 
before the goal can be obtained within’ the school. Your Majesty has called our at- 
tention anew to the significance attached to the proper assimilation of religion, and 
in giving prominence to those periods in our Prussian history that have influenced 
the moral and religious culture of the people, and we are under the deepest indebt- 
 
-P-A-G-E-386
  358 EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
edness to Your Majesty for having pointed out to us the way in this vigorous and 
, energetic manner. This proclamation of the Ist of May, 1889, fell directly in the 
midst of an already powerful agitation, which in the sphere of education had taken 
hold of all Germany. In great movements it can never be known precisely where the 
beginnings are to be found; but it may be confidently put forward as a general 
statement that the altered position of Prussia and of Germany among the nations of 
the world had widened our horizon, and had brought the question to all our lips, 
whether our education could go on in precisely the same line as before, when Ger- 
many was rather a self-centered people, leading a solitary, speculative life. Now 
that our eyes are opened, that our gaze is directed toward all nations, now that we 
have colonies in future, we have everywhere the impression that we shall per- 
haps in one way or another be obliged to break through the hedge that hitherto has 
surrounded our system of education. Still more clearly was the tendency to be recog- 
nized toward a more real mastery of the subjects of instruction, toward the improve- 
ment in the methods of the teachers, toward gaining time for the strengthening of 
the young. 
This agitation became all the more powerful and intense in Prussia, since in Prus- 
sia on account of an excessive number of higher schools and an excessive production 
of men with an academic training all the learned professions were crowded; and 
therefore in the stress, in the struggle for existence, a multitude of doubts arose as 
to whether the schools themselves, the methods of in8truction, were not to blame. 
Thus we in Prussia, in contrast to the South German states, have entered upon an 
- agitation in which the question of privilege in the battle of competition assumes 
predominating importance. Iam not in position even to sketch in an introductory 
address the chief directions which the principal movement has taken. It may, how- 
ever, with confidence be said, that from the most radical conceptions to the most 
conservative, every possible new proposal has ‘been presented, But the Prussian 
school system has—and this must certainly be brought forward in the introductiou— 
an eminent political significance in this respect, that it has become a unifying bond 
within the German states. The other German states have modeled themselves after 
Prussia; they have made contracts with Prussia in regard to the qualifications of 
teachers and certificates of maturity. The imperial legislation has taken charge of 
the directions for doctors and lawyers, the Prussian legislation of the directions for 
theologians and teachers; in short, in all spheres a bond has been formed between 
Prussia and the other states of Germany. And if we here, to-day, are an entirely 
Prussian assemblage, still we must bear in mind that all Germany has its gaze fixed 
attentively upon us. Itis true that-we have among us, with permission of their 
governments, three gentlemen who do not belong to Prussia, but I have declared 
to the gentlemen, and repeat it here, that they are not here as representatives of 
their states, but as schoolmen who haye accomplished something of importance in 
certain directions, And I thank the governments here in this place that they have 
placed the services of these distinguished gentlemen at our disposition. 
That which is especially to distinguish theso deliberations is complete freedom 
of discussion. It is the pressing desire of the educational department to receive from 
the gentlemen who are assembled here material and forms as sure and trustworthy. 
foundations for the further resolutions which shall then be submitted to Your 
Majesty for your most gracious criticism, The order of business shall give complete 
freedom. It will be impossible to avoid disagreement; that will come, however, not 
from groups, but from single individuals, so that the source of the disagreement will 
always lie clearly before our eyes. It is possible that in some cases a second reading 
may be necessary, whero an arrangement is not reached at the first. On this point 
I reserve further regulatiors, 
In closing, I will say that I enter upon this conference with the firm hope of 
success. I am convinced that all the gentlemen assembled devote themselves with 
complete enthusiasm and consecration to the great tasks that form the substance of |
-P-A-G-E-387
  . : 
this conference; and if in the course of this consideration our power should weary, 
then we will turn to Your Majesty, and remember with thankfulness and vener- 
ation the zeal, the love, and the consideration which Your Majesty has ever had for ~ 
our entire school system. 
The Emperor replied as follows: 
GENTLEMEN: I greet you here most heartily, and I thank the honorable minister, 
that, in spite of an overburden of work of all kinds, he has undertaken to preside 
personally over this assembly. 
Iam firmly convinced that no man is better qualified and adapted to manage such 
a question skillfully and to contribute to its solution than our honorable minister of’ 
education, of whom I can say positively and without exaggeration, that in many 
years the German state and the Kingdom of Prussia has had no such able, devoted, 
and eminent minister of education as he. I hope that with your aid the work 
may be not only furthered but also brought to a conclusion. 
After the chairman had declared the sitting formally. opened, the 
Emperor again took the floor. 
ADDRESS OF THE EMPEROR AT THE OPENING OF THE CONTERENCE. 
GENTLEMEN: I desire to address a few words to you at the outset because it seemed 
to me important that you should know from the first what I think about this matter. 
Naturally there will be many things discussed that can not be decided, and I be- 
lieve that many points will remain cloudy and obscure. I have considered it 
proper not to leave the gentlemen in doubt as to my own views, 
In the first place I wish to observe that we have to do here above all not witha 
political school question, but entirely with technical and pedagogical measures 
“which we must adopt in order to fit the growing generation for the demands of the 
present, for the position of our Fatherland and of our life in the world at large, 
Just at this place I wish to make one observation. I would have been very glad if 
we had designated these investigations, these proceedings, not with a French word 
“Schulenquete,” but with the German word, “Schuifrage.” ‘‘Frage” is the old 
German word for trial examination, and I must say this is also more or Tens trial 
examination. Let us then call the affair briefly “‘Schulfrage.” 
Ihave read through the fourteen points and find that they could easily ‘aaa 
into a schematizing of the matter. I should regret that in the highest degree. The 
chief thing is to grasp the spirit and not merely the form of the affair. So I have 
on my part proposed some questions—I will have them circulated—and I hope that 
they also will find consideration. : 
First, school hygiene outside of gymnastics, a matter that must be consiiered very 
carefully; then diminution in the subjects of study (consideration of what must _ 
be cut out); further, the plans of instruction for the individual studies; then the 
system of teaching, the organization—the chief points have already been brought 
forward; sixth, is the chief ballast removed from the examinations? and, seventh, 
is overburdening avoided for the future? Eighth, What idea have we of the control 
when the work is finished? Regular and extraordinary inspections by different 
higher ofiicials. 
I lay the questions here upon the table of the house; whoever wishes to look at 
them can inform himself further about them. 
The whole question, gentlemen, has developed gradually and entirely of itself. 
You stand here face to face with a matter which Iam convinced that you, through 
the completeness that you will give it, through the form that you will stamp upon 
it, will hand over to the nation as a ripe fruit. * 
This cabinet order, which the honorable minister has had the goodness to mention 
before, would perhaps not have been necessary if the schools had stood in the po- THE HIGHER SCHOOLS OF PRUSSIA. 3859

sition where they ought to have stood. I should like to observe in the outset that 
if Ishould be somewhat sharp I have reference to no one personally, but to the 
system, to the entire situation. If the schools had done that which we may demand: 
of them, and I can speak to you as one who is initiated, for I have also attended 
the gymnasium and know what goes on there, then they would of necessity have 
taken upon themselves from the very outset the fight against social democracy. The 
teaching faculties would have taken firm hold of the matter unitedly, and would have 
so instructed the growing generation that those young people who are of about the 
same age as myself, that is to say, about thirty years of age, would voluntarily offer 
the: material with which I could work in the state in order the more rapidly to be- 
come master of the movement. That has, however, not been the case. The last 
period in which our school was still a standard for our whole national life and of our 
_ development was in the years 1864, 1866 to 1870. Then the Prussian schools and the 
Prussian teaching faculties were the bearers of the idea of unity that was preached 
everywhere. Every graduate who came out of the school and began his volunteer mili- 
tary service or entered upon active life, all were united upon this one point: The Ger- 
man Empire shall be again established, and Alsace and Lorraine won back again. 
That ceased with the year 1870. The empire is united; we have that which we wished 
to gain, and there the matter-rested. Starting from the new basis, the school ought 
now to animate the youth and make clear to them that the new political condition 
exists, that it may be preserved. Nothing of this kind has been observed, and in the 
short time that the empire has existed centrifugal tendencies have already developed 
themselves. I can surely judge that accurately, because I stand at the top and all 
such questions come to me. The reason is to be sought in the education of the 
young. Where is the lack there? The lack is surely in many places. The chief 
reason is that since the year 1870 the philologists as beati possidentes have sat in 
the gymnasia and have laid their chief emphasis upon the subject that was taught; 
upon Jearning and knowing, but not upon the formation of character and the needs 
of the life of to-day. You, Mr. Privy Councilor Hinzpeter, will pardon me—you are 
an enthusiastic philologist; but none the less in my opinion the matter has reached 
a height where finally it can go no farther. Less emphasis has been placed upon 
the can than upon the ken; that is shown in the requirements that are made in ex- 
aminations. One proceeds from the axiom that above all things the scholar must 
know as much as possible; whether that is suitable for life or not is a secondary 
consideration. If one should converse with one of the gentlemen concerned and 
seek to explain to him that the young man must after all, to a certain extent, receive 
a practical preparation for life and its problems, the answer is ever, that is not the 
task of the schools; the chief object is the gymnastics of the intellect, and if these 
gymnastics were properly pursued the young man would be in a condition to accom- 
plish with these gymnastics all that was necessary for life. I believe that we can 
be no longer deluded from this standpoint. 
If I now return to the schools themselves, and especially to the gymnasium, I know 
very well that in many circles I am considered .a fanatieal opponent of the gymna- 
sium, and that I have been represented -in favor of other kinds of schools. Gentle- 
men, that is not the case. Whoever has been in the gymnasium himself and has 
caught a glimpse behind the scenes knows what is lacking there. Above all, the 
national basis is lacking. We must take the German as the foundation for the gym- 
nasium; we ought to educate national young Germans and not young Greeks and 
Romans. We must depart entirely from the basis that has existed for centuries— 
from the old monastic education of the Middle Ages, where the standard was Latin 
with a little Greek added. That is no longer the standard; we must make German 
the basis. The German exercise must be the central point about which all turns. 
If, in the leaving examination, a candidate produces a faultless German composition 
one can decide from that of the amount of intellectual culture possessed by the young 
man, and judge whether he is good for anything or not. Now, of course many objec--

tions will be made and it will be said, the Latin exercise is also very important; the 
Latin exercise is very good for the purpose of polishing the scholars in a foreign 
language, and I do not know what all else. Yes, gentlemen, I have gone through all 
that myself. How, then, does such a Latin exercise originate? Ihave very often had 
this experience, that a young man has received, I will say, 4+, on the whole satis- 
factory in the German composition, and in the Latin composition 2. The fellow de- 
served punishment instead of praise, for it is perfectly clear that he had not completed 
the Latin composition in the proper manner. And of allthe Latin compositions that 
we wrote there is not one in a dozen that was not produced with the aid of a 
pony. Such compositions were designated as good. . That was the Latin exercises 
But when we had to write a composition in the gymnasium on “Minna von Barn- 
helm” our work was hardly satisfactory. Therefore I say, away with the Latin 
composition; it hinders us and we lose our time for German over it. 
In like manner I should like to see the national sentiment further advanced with 
us in questions of history, geography,,and traditions. Pray let-us begin at home. 
After, when we are perfectly acquainted with our own rooms and chambers, then 
can we go to the museum and look around there also, But first of all we must be 
perfectly at home in the history of the Fatherland. The great elector was only a 
misty specter in my school days; the Seven Years’ War already lay outside of all -con- 
sideration, and history closed with the end of the preceding century, with the French 
Revolution. The wars forfreedom, which are the most important for the young citi- 
zen, were not gone through, and only through supplementary and very interesting 
lectures of Mr. Privy Councilor Hinzpeter was I in a position, thank Heaven, to 
learn these things. But that is precisely the punctum saliens. Why are our young 
people misled? Why do so many confused muddled reformers of the world appear? 
Why is our government continually growled about and foreign lands referred to? 
Because the young people do not know how our conditions have developed them- 
selves, and that the roots lie in the time of the French Revolution; and therefore I 
am firmly convinced that if we explain to the young people in its chief traits this 
transition from the French Revolution to the nineteenth century, they will get quite 
a different understanding for the questions of to-day from that which they have 
hitherto had, They are then in a position to improve and increase their knowledge 
through the supplementary lectures which they will hear in the university, 
If I come now to the occupation of our young people it is absolutely necessary that 
we reduce the number of hours. Mr. Privy Councilor Hinzpeter will remember 
that at the time I was in the gymnasium at Cassel the first ery of distress was heard 
from parents and families that it could go on sono longer. In consequence advances 
were made by the government; we were required to give to the director every morn- 
ing a slip containing the number of hours of home study which we had found neces- 
sary in order to master the task set for the following day. I touch here especially 
merely upon the figures for Prima. Now, gentlemen, with entirely honorable re- 
turns—in my case Mr. Privy Councilor Hinzpeter could still regulate them—there 
appeared for each individual 54, 6}, to 7 hours of home study. Those were the grad- 
uates, Add to that 6 hours of school, 2 hours for eating, and then you can figure up 
how much was left of the day, If I had not had opportunity to ride out and in, and 
to move about a little freely besides, I would not have known at all how the 
world looks, Those are tasks which can not be continually laid upon young people. 
According to my thinking also we must help and relax lower down. Gentlemen, it 
will notdo; we cannot bend the bow farther, cannot leaveit so tense. Here we must 
step down; here we have already overstepped the most extreme limits. The schools— 
I will now speak of the gymnasiums—have accomplished the superhuman, and haye, 
according to my opinion, brought about an entirely too great overproduction of cul- 
t:vated men, more than the nation can bear, and more than the cultivated people 
themselves can bear. So the word that we have, coming from Prince. Bismarck, is 
right, the word “ graduateproletariat”. All the so-called ‘“‘hungercandidates”, espe-

cially the journalists, they are multifarious ruined gymnasiasts; they are adanger for 
-us. This superfluity, that is already too great, like a saturated field that can take 
in no more, must be disposed of. On that account I will not sanction another gym- 
nasium that can not prove absolutely its right to existence and its ere We 
have enough already. 
But now we come to the question, how are we to get at the wishes with regard to 
classical culture, and with reference to practical culture, and with reference to the 
privilege of one-year voluntary military service? I claim that the matter can be 
settled quite easily, in clearing up the views that have obtained hitherto by one radi- 
_ eal step, by saying, classical gymnasia with classical culture, a second class of schools 
with practical eulture, but no real-gymnasia. The real-gymmasia are half and half 
institutions; through them a half and half eulture is obtained and it gives only a 
half and half preparation for life afterwards. 
Very just is the complaint of the directors of the gymnasia concerning the mon- 
 strous ballast of scholars that they have to drag along, who never get to gradua- 
tion, and wish merely to obtain the privilege for one year voluntary military serv- 
ice. Very well; the matter can be easily helped by introducing an examination at 
the point where the volunteer wishes to leave, and outside of that to make his priv- 
ilege depend, in ease he attends a real-school, on producing the leaving certificate of 
the real-school. Then wo shall soon see that the whole procession of these candi- 
dates for the one-year military service will go from the gymnasia to the real-schools ; 
for when they have gone through the real-school they have what they want. 
I join with this a second point which I have already touched upon; it is this: A 
reduction in the amount taught is possible only through a simplification of the ex- 
aminations. Let us take grammatical topics entirely out of the leaving examina- 
tions and put them in one or two classes lower down, hold an examination there, a 
technical grammatical examination ; then you ean test the young people as sharply as 
you will; then you ¢an join with this examination that for the volunteers, and con- 
neet with it besides for those who wish to become officers the examination for ensign, 
se that they will not need to take that again. As soon as we have modified the ex- 
aminations in this direction, and have relieved the gymnasia in this manner, then 
_ will the force again appear that has been lost in the schools, and especially in the 
gymnasia, education, character-building. With the very best intentions we can 
not attain that now, where there are thirty boys in the class, and they have so great 
a task to master, and moreover the instruction is often given by young people whose. 
own Character must very often be perfected. Here I should like to intreduce the 
watchword that I have heard from Privy Councilor Hinzpeter: He who will edu- 
eate must be himself educated. That can not be absolutely affirmed of the entire 
corps of teachers. Im order to make education possible the classes must be relieved 
with regard to the number of pupils. _ That will happen in the way I have just de- 
seribed. Then we must depart. entirely from the idea that the teacher is only there 
to give lessons daily, and that when he has completed his task his function is ended. 
If the school draws the children away from the parental root, as it actually does, 
then it must assume the education and responsibility for the same. If you will edu- 
cate the young, weshall have another sort of graduates. Moreover, we must give up_ 
the principle that knowledge, and not life, aloné is important; the young people 
must be prepared for the practical life of to-day. 
I have written down some figures that ‘are interesting statistically. There are in 
Prussia 398 gymnasia and progymnasia, with 80,979 scholars; 172 real-gymnasia and 
real-progymuasia, with 34,465 scholars; 60 higher real-schools without Latin and 
higher burgher schools, with 19,893 scholars. Of the scholars in the gymnasia 68 
per cent obtained the privilege for one year voluntary service; of those.in the real- 
gymnasia, 75 per cent, and in the schools without Latin, 38 per cent. In the gymna- 
sia 31 per cent obtained certificates of maturity in the leaving examination; in 
the real-gymnasia, 12 per cent, and in the higher real-schools, 2 per cent. Each

      THE HIGHER SCHOOLS OF PRUSSIA. 363 
scholar in the institutions named has about 25,000 hours of school and home study, 
and in this number not far from 657 hours for gymnastics. That is a preponderance 
of intellectual work that must certainly be reduced. For the 12, 13, or 14 years old _ 
pupil the average number of hours per week, including gymnastics and singing, is 32; 
in some institutions it reaches 35,and in Tertia of the real-gymnasia we may say and 
write 387. Now, gentlemen, we are all of us more or less mature and work as much as 
wo can, but in the long run wé could not stand such labor. The statistical re- 
turns concerning the spread of schocl diseases, especially nearsightedness, are truly 
alarming, and for many diseases general statistics are still lacking. Think a mo- 
“ment what recruits are coming up for the defense of the country, I am looking for 
soldiers; we wish to have 4 robust generation, who can serve the Fatherland also 
as intellectual leaders. and as officials. This mass of nearsighted individuals is 
for the most part unserviceable, for how can a man who can not use his eyes ae- 
complish much in after life? The number of the nearsighted in single cases rises in 
Prima as high as 74 per cont. I can say from my own personal experience that, 
although we had a very good room at Cassel, the room for the teachers’ meeting, 
with good light coming from one side and good ventilation, which was introduced 
at my mother’s wish, yet out of 21 scholars 18 wore spectacles, and there were 2 of 
them who could not see as far as the blackboard with their spectacles. These 
matters judge themselves. We must interfere at that point, and I consider it very 
urgent that the question of hygiene be taken up in the training schools for teachers, 
that the teachers receive a course in it, and that with it be joined the requirement 
that every teacher who is healthy must be able to go through with gymnastic exer- 
cises, and must do it every day. 
These, gentlemen, are in general the matters I wished to bring before you, things 
that haye touched my heart, and I can only give you this assurance. The innumer- 
able petitions, requests, and wishes that I have received from parents, although we 
fathers were declared in the preceding year by my honored Mr. Hinzpeter to be a 
party that had nothing to say concerning the education,of children, place me, as the — 
common father of the country, under tho obligation of declaring it can go no 
further so. Gentlemen, men are not to look at the world through spectacles, but 
with their own eyes, and are to find pleasnre in that which they have before them, 
their native land and its institutions. To this end you are now to help. 
Impressions produced by the address of the Emperor.—“This peaceful 
association of disputing gymnasiasts would probably not have oceupied 
the general attention especially but for the energetic personal inter- 
ference of the Emperor. The daily papers had for the most part greatly 
modified their expectations, when the first speech of the Emperor sud- 
denly struck a quite unexpected tone. -Atleastit seemed so. The first 
effect was one of amazement; a dull feeling of a tremendous blow 
against the whole previous management. All that could be heard at 
first was, ‘It can go on in this manner no longer,’ and ‘The gymnasia 
have not done their duty, and‘I know how matters go on there,’ and 
‘Among the teachers there are many uneducated people.” ; 
The address was the sensation of the hour. Although clear and di- 
rect, it was not explicit in details and left room for misunderstanding 
and debate as to its true meaning. A general impression was that the 
speech bore heavily upon Von Gossler and that he would be compelled 
to retire, although such an interpretation seemed widely at variance 
with the high compliment paid him by the Emperor in his first remarks. 
Of the address in detail it was said— 
     
-P-A-G-E-392
  avi 
  864. “EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
(1) That the remarks on socialism were wide-of the mark, since the 
educated classes were not socialists, and moreover the teachers had no 
time and were allowed by the regulations no opportunity to combat 
socialism. If any teachers were socialists it was those in the common 
schools, and they were driven into socialism by their wretched salaries 
and cireumstances, 
(2) The gymnasial teachers resented strongly the imputation that 
they were to blame for the increase of socialism, 
(3) There was a general consensus of opinion among all classes in 
regard.to (a) the increase of the number of hours for German, history, 
and geography; (2) the diminution in the total number of school hours, 
or at all events less home work; (¢) the abolition of the daily Latin 
essay; (@) the overproduction of educated men, or, as the Germans 
say themselves, they have too many “Gebildete” in the country. 
(4) The friends of the real-gymnasium felt that they had been struck 
a heavy blow. 
(5) The newspapers resented strongly the words of the Emperor’in 
regard to the “hunger candidates” and journalists. The National 
Zeitung said in this regard: : 
The German journalists belong so little to the “hunger candidates” that very many 
high officials in the service of the state are very glad to exchange their positions 
for a position on the press, if they can get it; we are often in the situation of being 
obliged to refuse such requests. And in regard to what it accomplishes the press 
can stand a comparison with all the other factors in our public life, although, like 
all these, it offers opportunity for criticism in regard to many details. 
(6) The teachers as a class felt injured at the reflection presumed to 
be contained in the words “He who educates must be himself educated, 
and that can not now be affirmed of the teaching class as a whole.” 
Other expressions of the Emperor, however, especially the cabinet 
order at the close of the proceeding, proved clearly that these words 
were not meant to convey any such reproach as it was assumed that they 
did, and itis more than probable that the Emperor referred to the 
faulty pedagogical preparation that the teachers received at the uni- 
versities, for which the universities, and not the teachers, were certainly 
responsible. 
This active participation of the Emperor in the proceedings of the 
conference was, in itself, generally regarded with favor. The impres- 
sion produced was, on the whole, a goog one. It can not be denied 
that his address was in the main clear and forcible. It was evidently, 
moreover, the straightforward expression of his own views, and. not in- 
tended to dictate in advance the course of the debate, or to overawe the 
assembly in any manner. He came to the conference and expressed 
his own views plainly, and as the subsequent proceedings showed, the 
members of the conference did not hesitate to oppose those views. The 
address did no doubt once more arouse popular interest in the confer- 
ence to a high pitch, and it probably infused.a vigor and life into the 
deliberations that they might otherwise.have lacked.

  THE HIGHER SCHOOLS OF PRUSSIA, 365 
Debate on question 2.—At the conclusion of the Emperor’s remarks 
the conference passed to the consideration of the second question pro- 
posed by the ministry, and Dr. Uhlig opened the debate. In treating 
of a common or union school as a common basis for all the higher 
schools, he referred especially to the experience of the Scandinavian 
countries where such a system had been in force for some time,. and 
the figures he presented in this connection had much influence upon the 
conference. That such a union school would lessen the overcrowding © 
of the learned professions was disproved by the fact that in Norway, 
where a like school had existed since 1869, the overcrowding was still 
a pressing evil and was said to be on the increase. Graduates in phi- 
lology of ten years’ standing still were seeking positions; young physi- 
cians went to America in troops; the number of students. increased. in 
the University of Christiania from 72 in 1878, to.377 in 1887... In Swe- 
den, where a union school had existed since 1873, the condition of af- 
fairs was quite as bad. The number of physicians is as great again 
as thirty years ago, whereas the population has increased only one- 
fourth. Jurists who have passed all their examinations are glad to 
get a place on the police force. And in Denmark, which has had a 
similar organization since 1850, the number of students in the Uni- 
versity of Copenhagen has increased five-fold. In regard to the sug- 
gestion that such a plan would be cheaper, Dr. Uhlig said that such a 
reason was neither pedagogic nor patriotic. It had once been said of 
German industrial products that they were “cheap, but bad.” That 
would never be said of German schools. Dr. Uhlig quoted at some 
length from a letter of Prof. Wheeler, of Cornell University, after say- 
ing, “I do not fear, gentlemen, for humanistic culture; I believe that 
it will blossom in the twentieth century as it does in the nineteeth. If 
Thad entertained any doubts on this subject they would have been 
dissipated by the insight that I have recently gained into the elevation 
of humanistic studies and humanistic instruction in North America.” 
At the conclusion of Dr. Uhlig’s remarks the meeting was adjourned. 
Second session. Continuation of the debate on question 2,—The second 
session of the conference, on Friday, December 5, was devoted entirely 
to the consideration of the second question. This was one that brought 
out a great difference of opinion, notwithstanding the fact that it was 
a foregone conclusion that the decision would be in the main what it 
was. Dr. Schiller, co-referee with Dr. Uhlig, confined his attention to 
the second part of the question, and remarked that the real question at” 
issue in changing the point at which instruction in Latin should begin 
was whether a part of the Latin learned should be forgotten four years 
earlier or later; and lessening the number of hours devoted to Latin 
would mean simply dropping out a mass of useless stuff that the teachers 
now found time for and consequently taught. Dr. Schlee, director of 
the real-gymnasium in Altona, a unique institution in which some of the 
features advocated by the reformers had been introduced, represented 
 
-P-A-G-E-394
  366 "EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
- the cause of a union school. He remarked that the school question 
had been treated hitherto as a gymnasial question, whereas he believed 
that it was a problem set by advancing culture and civilization. The 
definite problem was, how to provide a more complete and rounded 
education in the space of six years; and how to draw away from the 
gymnasia scholars who were following its course without having in 
view the purposes for which the gymnasium had been erected. The 
erection and fostering of higher burgher schools had not attained the 
latter object. They had increased 90 per cent, while higher schools as 
awhole had increased but 81} per cent. Therefore the burgher schools 
had not been recruited from scholars who would otherwise have attended 
some higher school. In regard to the Scandinavian countries, Dr. 
Schlee said that a comparison with foreign countries was always mis- 
Jeading, since the conditions were essentially different; Sweden had 
one foreign language more to teach than Germany, namely, German; 
the gymnasium there had but 32 weeks instead of 40, and had a total 
— of but 1,536 hours for Latin as compared with 2,000 hours in the German. 
gymnasia. Moreover, the director of the educational system in 
Sweden had said, in a recent letter, that though there were faults, and 
opposition existed, yet no one wished to go back, and the existing ar- 
rangement is firmly rooted. 
Dr. Thiel, of the ministry of agriculture, ete., spoke especially of the 
gymnasial training in its relations to business life. Two-thirds of the 
gymnasial graduates entered business, In Prussia there were 171 
cities where the gymnasium was the only high school. The whole 
programme of the gymnasium was cut out for a totally different purpose 
than that of preparing young people who had not completed the entire 
course to enter business life, and those who left from Tertia or Secunda 
had a very faulty preparation, That was a ground that had not been 
brought out the day previous, why the learned professions were over- 
crowded. The great number of scholars who attend the gymnasium 
because it offers an easy way of attaining a valuable privilege, that of 
one year’s service, easily fall into the danger of being turned aside from 
the career of a merchant or business man because they have become 
too old and have not the proper preparation, do not know modern Ian- 
guages, drawing, etc. They therefore go on studying because they do 
not know what elsetodo. The gymnasium actually sent out two-thirds 
of its scholars without any preparation for practical life. In all branches 
of the government the opinion prevailed that the study of the dead 
languages was a very unfruitful one unless it was carried on to a cer- 
tain point. 
Dr. Virchow, the distinguished scientist, spoke as the oldest uni- 
versity teacher and as a physician. After referring to the former use 
of Latin for intercourse between different nations, and citing a modern 
instance of the same, he said: “A practical necessity of studying the 
ancient languages does not actually exist.” The ancient literature
-P-A-G-E-395
  THE HIGHER SCHOOLS-OF PRUSSIA. 367 
Served more to show the sources of prejudice than the sourees of 
knowledge. “I do not belong at all to those who rave against the 
ancient languages. On the contrary, I have endeavored for a long 
time to retain the ancient languages in our programmes; I have taken 
a stand again and again for Greek. But when year after year one has 
the experience that a constantly increasing number of graduates of the 
gymnasia appear at the university who do not have any ability to 
make any use of their knowledge of language that deserves to be 
mentioned, one must confess that that has been an idle task. Dr. 
Wehrenpfennig has undertaken to show how the different categories — 
of.scholars are equipped when they enter life. They are equipped, I 
would like to say, only with certificates; the real question is, how are 
they equipped in other respects. We must understand that it is the 
duty of the school to produce, not certificates, but eapable men. Gen- 
tlemen, if the learned class is not to be the place to seek for persons — 
who shall adapt themselves through their own exertions to new rela 
tions with greater ease than the average man, then we have all got to 
pack up. Jam sorry that I can not testify-that we have made progress 
for character-building in the scholars in the sphere of the examinations 
for the scholars. Iam aware that it sounds somewhat severe when I 
affirm that the sound human understanding is a little erushed in the 
higher schools, in that the boys are Jed to take up so much that is 
doctrinaire, so many learned formulas, that they do not really see 
things as they are, but that they see something in them that is not 
there at all. The school as it has become is not a proper preparation 
for the study of the natural sciences and of medicine. We have indeed | 
a great deal of opportunity to work with material that has not come 
from gymnasia. All of our American and Japanese scholars, a 
great part of the English, and a not inconsiderable portion of those 
from évery conceivable nation have no proper gymnasial training. The 
greater number of these young men without classical training devote 
themselves to their work with much greater earnestness and much more 
consecration than the majority of our gymnasial graduates, especially 
in the earlier part of their courses. In our gymnasia a tnultitude of 
tasks are performed that have no visible effect.” 
Dr. Holzmiiller declared that after having been, in 1885, a violent 
partisan of the union school, he had come to oppose it most decidedly. 
*¢One school can not be a ‘maid of all work”” He suggested that some 
combination might be permitted as a makeshift for small towns, with 
a distinct understanding that it was to be avoided in the larger cities. 
Dr. Frick, the distinguished educator, director of the Francke Insti- 
tutions in Halle, continued the discussion. “A common fault of all 
classes of the higher schools is that the instruction is too little consid- 
ered as a continuation of the earlier work of the common schools, and 
too little treated with reference to an adequate basis for all the work 
that is to follow, and the instruction in foreign languages is introduced 
 
-P-A-G-E-396
  368 : EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. oe : 
too soon.” He opposed the introduction of Latin in Sexta, and stated 
that in his own experience those who had taken up the study later had 
made the better progress. The senseless stuff usually offered to such 
young scholars in their reading and exercise books came in for sharp 
and sarcastic treatment. Dr. Frick proposed lengthening the course 
of study by a year, an addition which he said no more than corre- 
sponded to the additional requirements that were made upon the school. 
“Latin composition can fall, according to my conviction. For the sake 
of Cicero-we occupy our scholars for years with the period of the Ro- 
man commune and its disreputable heroes like Catiline, Antony, ete., 
when the reading ought to bring about an ideal intercourse with the 
really great spirits of the Roman people.” 
Dr. Uhlhorn spoke earnestly in favor of reducing the amount of work 
required in the schools. The gymnasiasts were overfed, and therefore 
they had less hunger for knowledge than the Americans and English. 
“T greatly prefer the graduate who goes to the university with little 
knowledge but with a great hunger for knowledge to the one who has a 
great mass of information but little hunger, who knows it all already and 
does not need to learn anything. The school hours must, if possible, 
be reduced to 24. It has been said that much is taught that has no 
visible effect. Let me say openly that I greatly prefer that which has 
an invisible effect to that which has a visible effect.. I believe that the 
chief thing, that is to say, the whole culture and structure of a man 
does not admit of measurement. Let us go once so far as to gauge 
the value of instruction according to its visible effect, and we will soon 
reach the point where we will measure the value of what is learned in 
the schools according as it does or does not lead to money-making, and 
then Germany will be lost; then all will be over with its dominant posi- 
tion among European nations. Above all, it matters not so much what 
is taught as how it is taught. ‘Man lives not, nor shall live, by the 
bread alone that the school crumbles for him.’ He lives also from that 
which other forces reach out to him; the force of the family, that of the 
church, and that of the entire life of the people. These forces also 
must share in the school; must take hold and codperate with it. Then 
we will be able to bear individual imperfections without injury. Not 
knowledge, but culture is the chief thing.” 
Dr. Jaeger, in a spirited address, opposed a common substructure, 
declaring that by shoving forward the point at which Latin was begun 
the difficulty in deciding as to a boy’s aptitudes wowd simply be post- 
poned, since Latin was precisely the study that gave the best opportu- 
nities for judging. “The truth is, that in Latin a bit of ‘Cultur-Ge- 
schichte’ is hidden in every word, and that prevents the instruction 
from sinking into triviality; it makes it scientific, even for the boy of 9 
years. The gymnasium must be preserved in its integrity, and the 
essence of the gymnasium does not consist in that the scholar reads 
any given Greek or Latin author in his fourteenth or, it may be, six-

teenth year, and also, not alone in that they are introduced to antiquity, 
but therein alone that by a gradual accustoming to exact knowledge, 
however itis grasped, the scholar is educated to knowledge in its highest 
sense.” He affirmed that if the gymnasium succeeded in’ graduating 
one-fourth of those who entered with a thorough preparation for the 
higher positions in life, it has accomplished a glorious mission; they’ 
never would perfect an institution where all that was necessary was to 
shove in a boy in Sexta and pull him out an accomplished graduate at 
the other end, The three-fourths who did not graduate were perhaps 
not so badly off as had been represented. If they were a little at a loss 
at first in going into business they very soon made up what was neces- 
sary. In concluding, he cleverly showed that a good deal was laid 
upon the schools that properly belonged elsewhere. ‘The gentlemen 
who do not belong to our craft judge us too harshly. For, gentlemen, 
we are really in a sad case. Everything falls upon us. The sins of 
the nursery are laid at our door, and at the other end we are reproached 
for what perhaps may have been overlooked—I am terrified at my own 
boldness—even at the university itself.” 
Dr. Matthias, speaking briefly, with especial refere ence to lessening the 
amount of work, said: ‘We must once more reach that point when an 
‘educated man will not need to be ashamed that he does not know every- 
thing. We teachers are so often in the position ef being regarded as 
two-legged encyclopedias. In society we hear, ‘You must know that, 
surely.’ But we ourselves and our pupils in the future, also, have the 
right not to know something; that is an inalienable right of man.” 
Several speakers referred to the proposal to begin the instruction in 
foreign languages with French instead of Latin, and opposed it on the 
following. ground: French was written one way and pronounced 
another; it was not so complete in its forms as Latin, etc. Dr. Albrecht, 
speaking from an experience of eighteen years in Alsace and Lorraine, 
said thet it was his observation that the scholars who began with Latin . 
afterwards got along much better with French than those who started 
with French. On the other hand, strong ground was taken for beginning 
with French. Said Dr. Schulze, “That in itself Latin offers to the 
scholars of Sexta more difficulties than French, and that, therefore, it 
is more natural and more correct, according to the pedagogical prin- 
ciples, to begin with French is scarcely to be disputed. But against 
the pursuit of this subject, in the humanistic gymnasium, an agitation 
has come upon the scene that has been carried on by severe but not 
always by fair means. Consequently in the great mass of the public 
a deep dissatisfaction has been created against the gymnasium as a 
whole, and especially against the early beginning of Latin. If we wish 
to remove or alleviate this dissatisfaction, it is only possible by yield- 
ing the priority to French, for the demand is in itself just. To proceed 
in this way is also wise politically, in relation to our scholars. Our 
boys bring the opposition to Latin with them to Sexta.” Referring to

the experience of Dr. Albrecht with the boys of Alsace, Dr. Schulze re- 
marked, “They are like those unlucky boys who come to my notice in 
large numbers here in Berlin who have learned to babble a little French 
from their nurse. These scholars make the poorest progress in German, 
in Latin, and also in French. That is quite comprehensible. They 
think, indeed, that they know French already, and now they are to 
learn it again in another and harder way. That arouses their oppv- 
sition.” : 
Third session.—Oontinuation of the debate on question 2.—The debate 
on question 2 was continued in the third session of the conference, on 
Saturday, December 6. The referees summed up their arguments, re- 
viewing the ground previously gone over, but a decision was postponed, 
as it was suggested that this question could better be voted upon after 
certain of the other questions had been discussed, inasmuch as the first 
four questions were closely connected. The conference then proceeded 
with the discussion of question 3, introduced by the referee, Mr. Horne- 
mann, in a long address, evidently too long, since immediately upon its 
_ conclusion the chairman called the attention of the meeting to the pro- 
. vision in the order of business that the referees should express them- 
selves as briefly as possible. 
Debate on question 3.—Mr. Hornemann answered the question with a 
decided affirmative, although he was a partisan of the gymnasium: “I 
think it is indisputable that our age stands in a different relation to 
the Roman. system than the preceding century. Science and life turn 
themselves more and more away from Latin. All the science in Ger- 
many speaks and writes German. Only sorrowful remains of Latin are 
found in the universities and gymnasiums. I wish to assert that con- 
tinued translations of sentences without any connection whatever, as 
is the common custom at present, create, perhaps not necessarily, but 
in reality very easily, precisely the opposite of accurate thinking, 
namely, thoughtlessness, I consider it the more important duty of 
the instruction in Latin to introduce the student to the historical great- 
ness of the Roman people. Precisely this duty has been repressed 
hitherto through grammatical formalism. I believe, nevertheless, al- 
though it is apparently a eontradiction, that the amount of Latin read- 
ing can be limited. For the historical greatness of Rome is less in its 
arts and poetry than in its systems of government, justice, and war- 
fare. Ovid gives in Tertia, along with Czsar, nothing more than an 
attractive variety. Virgil, it must be confessed, awakens only a mod- 
erate interest in Secunda. Horace alone, according to my experience, 
remains a poet whose works have an‘enduring effect. So the chief part 
of the reading would be prose; and since among the prose writers 
Cicero would for many reasons fall into the background, * * * the 
kernel of the Latin reading would be the great historians, Cesar in 
Tertia, Livy in‘Secunda, Tacitus in Prima. * * * English is of 
supreme importance. I need only point to the great influence of

English literature upon our own in the eighteenth century, to the in 
many respects typical significance of the social and: political condition 
of England, and finally to the great influence that England has won 
over us by its position in the market of the world, which it is exercis- 
ing in increased| extent just at the present when we are entering into 
a large commer¢e and are beginning to take part in the colonial move- 
ment. All this forces us to designate English as already a power in a 
general education. English has become the world language; it is eon- 
stantly increasing its influence. * * * It would be very desirable 
if English literature would crowd out the French in favor of our 
own. 8 ee Drawing demands time. Recently the Association of ~ 
German Teachers of Drawing had the following demands for the prep- 
aration of teachers printed and circulated: ‘The following are to be - 
admitted to the study of geometrical and free-hand drawing: (a) Grad- 
uates of the high schools with nine classes; (b) Teachers who have 
passed the second examination for teachers in the common schools and 
the examination for teachers in middle schools. The study itself ex- 
tends over three years, and it is to be pursued either in a technical 
high school or in the Academy of Art, or, finally, in an independent 
seminary for drawing teachers in Berlin, under the charge of a director 
trained both as an educator and as an artist. Opportunity is to be 
afforded the students to hear pedagogic lectures and, if possible, for 
observation of the instruction in the higher schools, and for giving in- 
struction. The examination is to be special and practical. The first 
is to take place immediately upon the conclusion of the studies, the 
second at the end of two trial years. Teachers in middle schools are 
to be exempt from the latter.” Dr. Kruse, co-referee, followed: “The. 
magistrate of a small town in west Prussia invited me to visit his 
‘high school, which did not seem to him quite safe. I went, listened 
toa few lessons, and finally asked the director, ‘What is the special 
purpose in your instruction?’ He answered, ‘We prepare for the gym- 
nasiums, progymnasiums, real-gymnasiums, real-progymnasiums, higher 
burgher schools, agricultural schools, and trade schools.’ That, gentle- 
men, is the finest union school you can imagine. Nevertheless, at my — 
suggestion, it was quickly transformed iato a higher burgher school 
without Latin. As the sole ground for the early beginning of French 
the flexibility of the voice for learning the French pronunciation has 
been asserted. Gentlemen, it is a pedantic presumption for us Ger- 
mans to wish to speak a foreign language like natives. If an English- 
man or Frenchman speaks German with us, he can not and will not 
modulate his voice like the German, and his foreign pronunciation 
sounds altogether agreeable to us. But the German, who has given 
himself no trouble whatever to rid himself of the faults of his local 
dialect, wishes to speak French only after th® fashion of Geneva or of 
Paris. Where shall we get the teachers?. The educational ministry 
grants stipends, it is true, for stady in foreign lands, but the young

men studied Provengal, old manuscripts, and speculate in order not to 
be behind the older philologists. Not seldom do these young men come 
home and say, ‘We had to learn our French pronunciation all over 
again.” Therefore little weight is to be attached to the pronunciation 
‘and the flexibility of the voice. * * * I am of the opinion that we 
ean cheerfully strike all the rules for gender out of the Latin grammars. 
This great and cumbersome apparatus serves a very inconsiderable 
purpose, and the rules—most of them amount to almost nothing.” 
Dr. Schottmiiller, in a brief address, made some apt criticisms. “The 
school has accustomed itself for a long time to regard itself as an end 
in itself. It seems as though this idea was not to be abandoned. In 
opposition to this view we heard at the opening of the conference that 
~ the school had to adapt itself asa working member into the entire or- 
ganism, that it must strive to satisfy completely the needs that are 
presented to it as necessary. * * * It goes very much to our heart, 
‘too, to cut off the bough on which we are perched; idealism has worked 
  itself so thoroughly into our. flesh and blood that we fee! it bitterly, 
perhaps, not to be able to transmit to our children and grandchildren 
what we have had. But such asuperabundance of demands have been 
made that it can go.on sono longer. * * * If, now, the school does 
not really have the duty of furnishing all the knowledge that may be 
useful in life, then it does not matter so much what is learned as how it 
is learned. . From this standpoint we can do away with a great deal. 
The number of hours of study and recitation that are passed sitting 
must be reduced, * * * One of the greatest misconceptions in the 
arrangement of our. school programmes is the provision for optional 
studies. The overcrowding of the scholars comes for the most part 
from this. If an individual, according to his own option, may take 
singing, drawing, gymnastics, English, and Hebrew, then it need cause 
no- wonder that the scholars have eight hours of work, without reck- 
oning home exercises. If English is introduced, let it be obligatory, 
or not atall” * * * 2 
Dr. Von Helmholtz, the distinguished scientist, said that this ques- 
tion gave him an opportunity to say what he desired to lay before ‘the 
conference, and made a notable address. It deserves the extensive 
quotations that follow: “I must at the outset indicate my standpoint. 
I consider it very essential that the best possible schools shall be pro- 
vided for the better gifted part of the nation, and that these shall be 
protected as far as possible from the pressure of scholars who might 
better go into other schools, and I hope that the views that have 
been expressed by His Majesty on this point will essentially lighten 
and assist our task in this direction very soon. As the best means for 
giving the best mental training, we can regard the ancient languages 
_ alone as authenticated. But I must say that the objects that I myself _ 
  would have in view, and that seem to me the most important, are joined. 
almost altogether with Greek, and Latin seems to me to deserve only.
-P-A-G-E-401
  THE HIGHER SCHOOLS OF PRUSSIA. 373 
a secondary consideration. It has indeed won a great historical sig- 
nificance for many of our learned professions. It is, perhaps, also the 
best means of leading to an understanding of Greek. It has a firm 
and complete form, similar to the French language, and the study of 
Latin is undoubtedly useful for cultivating the language sense, But for 
real intellectual training as I conceive it, that is, for cultivating a refined 
* taste not only for language but also for moral and aesthetic matters, it 
deserves relatively little consideration. The Latin authors that we 
still have and are able to read, are, with exception of certain specialists, 
who describe military affairs, or have written original works on history, 
and the lawyers and jurists, after all authors of the second rank. Of 
poets, the original works of Plautus can not well be.read. Terence, 
Horace, Ovid, are attractive authors, * * * but the time for read- 
ing Latin must for the most part be spent.on authors who can only be 
_ designated as imitators; from them I do not expect much in the way 
of formation of taste and not much influence on the sense for language. 
* * * Tsee no ground for declaring against admitting graduates of 
the real gymnasium to the study of medicine. But I must always de- 
clare that the value of the true flower of classical culture seems to me 
so high that I would prefer to retain the classical studies so far as pos- 
sible, even at some sacrifices. In the physical laboratory I have had 
students who must be regarded as select; they ‘are not compelled to 
this work. Now it has often happened that those who came from 
the gymnasium were not quite so completely prepared in the first and 
second semester (term) in mathematics and physics as those who came 
from the real gymnasium. The latter had previously occupied them- 
selves more with physics, and it was easier for them at the start. But 
those who came from the humanistic gymnasium, if they continued 
their studies for a year, have always gotten so far that they could work 
independently, and find their own way independently. The real school 
seholars have for the most part fallen noticeably behind. I do not 
wish to lay that to any lack in the instruction of the real schools, for 
I do not fail to recognize that according to the conditions that have ex- 
isted hitherto those scholars who had the means and the necessary talent 
were thrust into the gymnasium and the g¥mnasium was always pre- 
ferred to the real gymnasium, because after completing the course in the 
latter certain limitations were encountered in the choice of a profes- 
sion. Under these circumstances it is natural that those scholars who 
are able to attend the gymnasium and those of somewhat less capacity — 
go to the real gymnasium. For exceptionally gifted scholars it makes 
no difference what school they attend—they help themselves. * *  * 
The most important results that we have always expected from the 
classical instruction is that the young people learn thereby to write 
their native tongue correctly and well. I had, as I have already said, 
select students in my laboratory, and it has always been a sort of 
punishment for me when, at-the end of the semester, the written theses

on what they have discovered in their scientific investigations come 
in. I have often had to give these productions back twice, thrice, four 
times, and lived for a time almost like a teacher in a gymnasium who 
has German compositions to correct. They were so little accustomed. 
. to arrange together what they had discovered, and to express it.sharply 
and unequivocally they had so much coarseness and carelessness in 
their German expression that I was always astounded. I must,.alas, 
confess that not alone students in the institute were such sinners, but 
that a whole procession of scientific specialists have the same failing. 
There are distinguished investigators who have produced works of the 
highest importance, but who write so badly that it is necessary to 
read each period two or three times in order to get the meaning, and 
finally it is impossible to make any sense out of it. * * * — Accord- 
ing to my not extensive experience, I cannot admit that overcrowding 
exists in our present gymnasium for scholars with good talents and 
gifts; the trouble is there are too many scholars in the gymnasium who 
do not belong there. * * * I consider it morally injurious when 
themes are set for the young people to write upon, concerning which it 
- is impossible that they should know anything honestly. They are com- 
pelled to hunt up phrases which make it appear as though they had 
something to say, while they conceal their ignorance. It is essentially 
the business of a ‘leader’ writer. The leader writers have generally 
had a mournful influence on our style. They prefer abstract words 
that sound significant, but admit of no definite conception. According 
to my views the Latin composition is the most notable of all leading 
articles, I consider it essential that somewhat more time and strength 
should be devoted to a real understanding of mathematics, and I think 
this will be best accomplished by the written treatment of mathemati- 
cal problems, and a careful supervision of the German expressions used 
in the same. I know from my own experience that I never feel sate 
when I have worked out a new problem until I have put it on paper. 
One only reaches a real control as to the correctness of mathematical 
reasoning when one has it on paper.” 
Fourth session — Continuation of the debate on question 3.—The fourth 
session was held on Tuesday, December 9. The debate on question 3 
was continued, Dr. Schrader, eurator of the University of Halle, being 
the first speaker: “The youthful powers are taxed too greatly under 
the present system. * * * I may be permitted to refer to an 
American, an ardent admirer of our school system, Mr, A. [D.?] White, 
who, with all the recognition that he grants our schools, yet says that 
he seems to miss something of the unemployed strength in our youth 
that he is accustomed to see in Americans and Englishmen. * * * 
The scholar is not to say what others think and believe; he is to say 
what he himself thinks, what he has gained; he shall be genuine in 
his judgments and in his tasks. * * * What we must give the 
youth in order to protect them against sinking into mere work-a-day

routine, against untrammeled lust for gain, against despondency and. 
a dejected blunting of all the finer faculties, and to sharpen their con- 
sciences and their moral sense, is idealism, the consciousness of their 
own moral responsibility. That can not be gained by dissipation’ of 
energy on several different subjects, but by a willing absorption in the 
subjects of chief importance. No teacher has ever sueceeded in in- 
spiring a youth for ten kinds of knowledge, no matter how attractive 
each kind might be, and by reason of the symmetrical constitution of _ 
the youthful mind that will always be impossible.” 
The debate on this question drew out more speakers than any other, 
and it will be impossible to do more than quote some of the most strik- 
ing and pertinent remarks. Said Dr, Kropatschek: “We must give 
up teaching in the schools everything that an educated man may pos- 
sibly need in his later life. That is simply impossible. The school is 
not to teach the elements of all culture, but the scholars are to acquire 
the capacity of learning, for themselves, all these things. The school is 
to teach how to learn.” Maj. Frick, speaking for the war ministry: 
“The leader himself can not carry out his plans, but he must know how 
to give his orders to those whom he is to lead in a precise, comprehen- 
sive, and plainly unmistakable fashion, for the least lack of clearness 
may be the cause of sacrificing hundreds, even thousands of men un- 
necessarily. That demands extraordinary mental training; above all 
things the officer must have a perfect command of his native tongue. 
One of the speakers leaves the impression that we soldiers make special 
and unusual demands on the school, That is not the case. We also 
wish that the young man who enters our ranks shall be equipped with 
a harmonious development of mind, heart, and character; we wish also 
that he shall understand the position of his country among modern 
civilized nations; that he comprehend his times and their duties, but 
does not forget where the roots of our culture are. Weare, in short, 
in peace sculptors, educators, teachers, in war leaders.” Dr, Paulsen 
made a sharp distinction between subjects of first and those of second- 
ary importance. ‘Iam also of the opinion that we introduce scholars 
to the peculiarities of both languages better through translation into 
German than by the reverse process. * * * <A true sense for lan- 
guage, such as protects the scholar from confusion will never more be 
attained in the school through expression in Latin. * * * The 
gymnasium can attain freedom only when it can say with a clear con- 
science, ‘I force no one to come in, I leave the other way open to every- 
one,’ ” 
Dr. Frommel, the court preacher, spoke in severe terms of the schools 
and also to some extent of the teachers, and, as might have been ex- 
pected, stirred up much feeling in the conference, so much that Dr. 
Stauder, on behalf of the ministry of education, challenged him to 
produce the proofs of what he had said, and if he had none, to be- 
ware of generalizing on an insufficient basis of fact: Said Dr. From-

mel: “TI have known most excellent men as teachers, men with the 
highest ideals, but I have also known men broken down, their ideal- 
ism gone, sunken in the misery of existence, destroying themselves 
in useless strife; men with mere formal culture, dead knowledge, 
embittered men. * * * But if our civil arrangements are such 
that they force a whole swarm of men into the gymnasium who do 
not belong there, and the departments of the administration demand 
a leaving examination from the people who always remain in the 
grades of the subaltern service—gentlemen, that makes social denio- 
crats. * * * Let us not deceive ourselves; bitterness instead of 
piety prevails among the youth of our gymnasiums; little enjoyment, 
much vexation; much criticism and little thorough knowledge and 
persevering industry. They are overdriven like a herd that can ad- 
_ vance no longer, and overirritated. The humanistic gymnasium, as it 
is to-day, guarantees no humanity as fruit. Humanity, as Schleirma- 
cher says, is harmony of mind and soul. * * * Giveus good teachers, 
and then give them the necessary freedom, and the programmes and 
all the rest will soon be found. Where there is a teacher behind the 
- instruction full of love and enthusiasm, the boy is kindled with or with- 
out a programme.” Dr. Zeller claimed that “the demands on the lan- 
guage instruction in the way of formal training were fully satisfied by 
the instruction in Greek and Latin, and I would recommend with the 
modern languages those methods that correspond to the practical aim 
of this instruction in reading, writing, and a knowledge of their liter- 
ature—one learns to speak well only after a long sojourn in a foreign 
land or when other opportunity is presented for much practice, and ~ 
then when good school instruction has preceded, the progress in speak- 
ing is tolerably rapid. * * * What the scholars do voluntarily is 
no such burden for them as that which they are compelled to under- 
take. The young scholars must be given time for their individual 
fancy. It is easier for them to spend six hours on favorite scientific 
_ studies and: they are less oppressive than three obligatory lessons. 
* * * When a young man learns in the schools obedience and con- 
scientious labor, when he has the ambition to do well-all that he does, 
when the school has wakened and fixed in him the feeling of personal 
responsibility, then it has done all that it can do.” 
Stath session—Debate on question 7.—It would be interesting to go 
_ into the debates on all the questions laid before the conference, espe- 
cially as the remarks were not always confined closely to the topic before 
the house, and some of the speakers who did not attend all the sessions 
took occasion to present their views on the whole subject under some 
particular topic. But for the purposes of this paper it will be necessary 
to limit the consideration to those topics that are of the most general 
interest and that apply as. well to the United States as to Prussia. 
_We will omit, therefore, the debates on questions 4, 5, and 6 to note 
some of the chief features in the debate on question 7, at the end of the
-P-A-G-E-405
  THE HIGHER SCHOOLS OF PRUSSIA. 31T: 
sixth session, held on Thursday, December 11. The question was not 
one that excited a warm discussion; on the contrary, there was sub- 
stantial unanimity of opinion. Nevertheless, some of the views and 
facts presented are of interest. | 
Dr. Jaeger, in opening the discussion, said: “We speak to-day of an 
individual treatment of the scholars, in so far as that may be possible, 
but we often forget that while an individual treatment, and conse- 
quently a moderate number of scholars, is desirable there is also a 
iInininum limit beyond which a common education—an education of -— 
the scholars by themselves by contact with each other—is no longer 
possible. <A ‘certain number is necessary to make up a class, if the 
class is to be a well-arranged organism, in which there are educating 
and formative forces that do not depend immediately upon the teacher 
or director; * * * for itis not true that the teacher shapes the 
individual, as is often asserted, but the individual shapes himself from 
the instruction of the teacher and the entire life of the school. Now 
that we are speaking of teachers, and not altogether with superfluous 
compliments, I should like to call attention to the fact that no class 
is subjected in so pitiless a mannef to public criticism as ours, and 
quite naturally so. Our first critics are the scholars, and moreover 
scholars from 8 to 18 years old, who, as is well known, always think 
extravagantly. These lay the foundation for public criticism. The echo 
of the judgment that they give shapes the parents’, who are especially 
sensitive on this point, and that also quite naturally, because the matter 
concerus their children. What the teacher does—I might almost say 
what he thinks—lies open to all the world. In one respect this is wrong, 
but in another it is good, for it compels—or let us rather say induces— 
the teacher to do nothing but what every man may see.” Dr. Kropatschek 
emphasized the necessity of the director knowing each scholar, and, 
therefore, the importance of keeping the institution as small as possible. 
He urged—and that sounds somewhat curious to American ears—that 
every director, or at least those in the larger schools, should be pro- 
vided with a secretary. “It is often a little hard for the director to 
get through with all the writing that he has to do, and even if no official 
secretary were allowed him, still he might be given some help in this 
direction.” Dr. Schiller said in regard to individual work: “The im- 
pression can easily be produced that when we have a maximum attend- 
ance of forty ina class the effect will be that we can individualize in 
our instruction. But unfortunately that is one of the big. words in 
which pedagogy is rich. As a matter of fact it is impossible then to - 
individualize in the pedagogic sense. * * * What belongs to 
individualization? First of all, that the individual scholar connect 
himself with the teacher as with a father. What that means when forty 
scholars are to join themselves to one teacher, and he is to reciprocate, 
you can well imagine.” 
   
-P-A-G-E-406
  378 EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
‘Dr. Kruse had some earnest thought for the teachers. “As for the 
burdening of teachers with too many lessons, that is for the most part 
quite tolerable now, for the reason that we have a whole outfit of vol- 
untary teachers. All that will change, for the teaching profession, 
- numerically considered, will deteriorate noticeably in the next five years. 
In one year, among two hundred graduates there were only three who 
wished to become teachers. The scholars in Prima have it daily before 
their eyes that the volunteer teachers must labor for years without com- 
_ pensation. * * * Asfor the general position of the teachers as a class, 
the school councilors have here been specially called upon to express 
themselves; and therefore I will not withhold the acknowledgment that 
if this assembly disperses without having done something tangible 
toward raising the feelings and the circumstances of the teachers I will 
consider it a great misfortune. I have never in my life belonged to an 
association or an organization that pursued personal or class interests; 
but to-day I hold it to be my duty to recognize here that we are on the 
_ point of forcing the most enthusiastic and the best teachers, directors, — 
‘and school councilors to throw down their arms. You can no longer 
control the humor of the teachers.” Hf now, at last, no help is afforded, 
the unions of restless elements that are spread through the entire mon. 
archy will gain the upper hand; the others will retire and say: with the 
school it can no longer go on thus.” 
Seventh session.— Debate on questions 8 and 9.—The seventh session 
was held on Friday, December 12. It was decided to discuss questions 
8 and 9 together. These, like question 7, were not controversial ques- 
tions; they were recognized as being of great importance, and the feel- 
ing of the assembly was for the most part harmonious. Dr. Schiller in- 
troduced the discussion of question 8 in a long and interesting speech. 
Some quotations can not be omitted. “I consider pedagogy as pre- 
ponderatingly a science of experience. But in the last few years the 
experiences in pedagogy have perhaps not been made, with sufficient 
broadness, the chief cause of which is the lack of free movement brought 
about by the leveling of the schools, that has allowed little chance for 
original development. If we had more private institutions, such as 
formerly deserved the highest praise for their development of methods, 
we would have been much farther advanced. * * * Jn the first 
place, Lask, what does the question mean by intensive methodic instrue- 
tion, and answer thus: The simplifying of the process of learning on the 
basis of psychological knowledge, with a stronger emphasis of the forces 
of educative value. Expressed concretely: 
“(1) The matter is to be limited to the elements of knowledge, and 
_ 80 to be simplified. 
“(2) Since facts have greater worth for the forming of the mind in 
proportion as they are derived as conclusions from knowledge already 
possessed, or by observation, or by a combination of these processes, the 
_ acquisition of facts must be transferred essentially to the instruction, 
 
-P-A-G-E-407

must come from the intellectual force of the scholars, and the result at- 
tained must be regarded as a starting point for the next goal. 
“(3) The individual subjects are to be brought into an organic rela- 
tion, in order to make the instruction thereby as harmonious as possible. 
“T ask myself, can instruction in the ancient and modem languages 
pursue the same aims? And Tanswer, No. The living languages must 
be imitated, spoken, and, as writing is a substitute for speaking, also 
written from life. For the dead languages, these aims are lacking. 
The culture value that lies in linguistic forms as means for expressing 
thought and in the authors who offer the youth a world of complete 
thoughts, feelings, and deeds that he can think over and feel over again, 
that refine and strengthen his will, fill his fancy,and furnish hismemory | 
with valuable contents, is common to all languages. If to-day the in- 
struction in the classics does not meet these requirements, it seems to 
me the cause is to be found in the following facts: 
“(1) In the existence of special vocabularies. 
“ (2) In the existence of printed exercise books for translation into 
foreign languages. 
“(3) In the extension of the grammatical instruction. 
“(4) In the kind of reading. 
“Etymological exercises, grammar, written. exercises, all these can 
be united only with the subject that comes up in the reading. We 
must see to this the more as the time for this instruction becomes less 
The most of the words acquired in the vocabularies, in the exercises, 
and in the grammar are entirely lost. I have taken pains to look 
through one of the best exercise books with a view to seeing what 
part of the matter in the vocabularies is of use later, and I have found 
that about half the words that are here learned never in his life come 
before the scholar again. Is that not a waste of strength and time? 
If we must to-day limit ourselves, then we must have reading books 
that are adapted for the later readings, whose extracts are taken from 
the authors that are read later, Special vocabularies are to be avoided, 
since they are a remnant of the Middle Ages, when Latin was studied as 
a living tongue; for collections of words and phrases are in place- 
only when a living language is to be learned quickly for the pur- 
poses of daily use, without the circuitous method of reading. * * * 
We have often undertaken to make parallel grammars, and there are 
excellent beginnings in existence. * * * But there is always too 
much learning in them forme. We have helped ourselves better by 
making our own Greek grammar, six and one-half pages, with exam- 
ples and short explanations. With it we are able to read extensively. 
Moreover, this path leads to the goal, and the past shows us the way. 
Similar arrangements were known fifty years ago. * * * The | 
necessity of simplifying and unifying the instruction would be best met 
by an internal codrdination of the subjects of study. I can not present 
there the entire organization of the instruction, but by a concrete exam-

ple I can illustrate to you how effectiveinstruction can be made through 
‘such an organization. I take, for example, the class Quinta. We have 
there three hours for geography, and German alone is considered. The 
whole material for the instruction in German, both the prose specimens 
and the poems, twenty-one of which are partly learned, and partly 
treated only in the class, relates to the home. The entire instruction 
has the tendency to introduce the scholars into the knowledge of home, 
to the history and geography of their German home, into the knowledge 
of both land and people. It forms the central point for the instruction 
in history, which is very closely interwoven with the instruction in 
German, and even geography, natural history, drawing, and singing 
all unite around this central point. The focus of the entire instruction 
is formed by eight historical pictures, such as Armin, the migration of 
the nations, Bonifacius and the introduction of Christianity, Frederick 
Barbarossa, ete. The last picture presents the founding of the new 
German Empire. All the instruction refers to this one central idea. 
Geography presents the stage on which all these actions took place, 
natural history presents the natural conditions     
                                                        models of the old Saxon and Frankish peasant

Schiller gave this conception of the necessity for such an institution. 
“An equipment must be furnished that corresponds to the whole sys- 
tem of education and instruction, every institution must have a col- 
lection of the best illustrative material and the best writings, every 
seminary must be a sort of educational museum, in which not alone the 
teachers of the institution find what they need, but to which all the 
teachers of the province may come and make themselves acquainted 
with the best helps that are in existence in the field of pedagogy.” 
Dr. Graf, after making some statements that threw doubt on the 
existence of overloading in the schools, quoted, with approval, the words

of Axcl Kay, “The demands of hygiene must be respected, whether 
there is over-exertion in the school or not, whether it ean be proved 
that the school has hitherto had an injurious effect on the health of the — 
scholars or not.” Dr. Graf further spoke earnestly in favor of school 
physicians. Dr. Werner, speaking at some length for the war ministry, 
said that the army could not use men who were near-sighted, and that it 
was certain that the schools were making them so, and in proof of the 
latter many figures were presented. 
The debate on question 9, relating to gymnastics, etc., was opened 
by Dr. Hitner, in a comprehensive address that is worthy of translation. 
After sketching the existing provisions for physical culture in the 
Prussian higher schools, substantially as given elsewhere in this paper, 
he proceeded to ask wherein lay the necessity for reform. ‘The exer- 
cises are selected to suit. the age and the powers of the boys, and fulfill _ 
completely the purpose for which they were intended; but, and here 
we reach the heart of the whole question, the time allowed for these 
exercises in the programme is not enough. * * * Ifthe school has 
the duty of developing all the powers and capacities of the pupil, both 
of his mind and his body, then there must exist above all a certain bal- 
ance between the intellectual and physical development. * * * If 
the instruction in gymnastics is really to have a salutary effect, then the 
instructors in gymnastics must take an active part in the whole work 
of education and instruction, for they also must be educators whose 
object is to advance the development of the physical nature in closest 
connection with the intellectual and moral aims. Pestalozzi would not 
have mere gymnasts as teachers of gymnastics, but ‘teachers who have 
aninsight into the development and connection of the human organism 
as a psychological unfolder of human nature.” * * * Gentlemen, it 
seems to me as though once more a lively interest in the youthful sports 
that have almost entirely disappeared for centuries may now be perceived 
jn all parts of Germany. In play especially a wonderful balance is dis- 
closed between intellectual and physical labor, since skill, adroitness, 
rapidity, and sureness of movement, a practiced eye, a strong and lasting 
foot, are of equal value with shrewd calculation, cunning device, and 
far-reaching plans. * * * Aside from this it affords the best means 
for recuperation from severe intellectual labor. More than this, the 
playground is the place for character forming for the growing genera- 
tion such as nowhere else exists. What no amountof admonition and 
preaching can accomplish is accomplished by intercourse with com- 
rades in play; here the obstinate lad must control himself else he will 
be excluded; here the insolent learns to be discreet, the quarrelsome 
to be patient, the defiant to be yielding; here all learn obedience and 
subjection, under the laws and rules of the game; all the comrades of 
one party learn something of the lofty consciousness of fighting with 
and for one another, of taking up arms for a common cause. Thus play 
becomes a school of life; it teaches all the traits and virtues that unite

men together in the family, the community, and the state. * * * 
Finally the sports offer the educator the best) of all opportunities of 
learning the characters of his scholars ina true mirror. The peculiarity 
of a scholar does not disclose itself everywhere pure and unconcealed. 
Before the authority of the teacher, before the commanding earnest- 
ness of duty, his nature often shows quite different from what it really 
is; but in play there is no concealment and no misrepresentation. 
* * * And how instructive it is for the well-wishing educator to 
observe. how this or that scholar whom he had found inattentive and ~ 
without interest in the class, stupid and without gifts, heré on the 
playground shows himself lively and interested, shrewd and inventive. 
Must not the teacher after such an insight into the nature of the pupil 
conclude that he himself was mistaken, that the instrument had no 
harmony for him merely because he did not know how to play on it. 
* * * Weighty considerations can not gain ground against the 
games introduced tous from England, lawn tennis, cricket, and foot- 
ball, so long as these are practiced and fostered merely as inspiring, 
varied, and highly interesting games, and are not treated as sports, 
and therefore as leading to a one-sided development of specialists or 
professional players. * * * Finally, the question as to whether the 
youth shall be left to themselves in playing, after what has been said 
in regard to the obligatory introduction of games, answers itself. With 
all the freedom and lack of restraint that cne gladly grants the boys 
in their play, everyone must still allow that a well-regulated game can 
not dispense with the authority of a director and adviser. This side 
also of young life demands a careful and intelligent oversight in order 
that the natural impulse to play may not Bante wrong paths and lead 
to excesses and roughness, That the young scholars do not regard 
such an oversight as an irksome constraint is shown by the fact that 
they honor and love those teachers the sp bee share their pleasures, 
who play with them.” f 
Dr. Gussfeldt said that though it might sound tike educational blas- 
phemy, it was his conviction that in all doubtful cases health and physi- 
cal culture should take precedence of its intellectual sister. Count 
Douglas wished the schools to introduce a course in “early aid for the 
injured,” in which the scholars could occupy some of their spare time 
as wellas in games. “You will all agree with me that if a hundred 
young men are properly trained in this way, and it happens that only 
one of them has an opportunity to save a human life by means of what 
he has learned, yet the trouble that it has cost to train the whole hun- 
dred is abundantly repaid.” Dr, Kropatschek had a word to say for 
the teachers. “If we desire that the teacher shall participate gladly 
_and freely in the gymnastic instruction, then we must also demand that 
the teacher get. something for it. Every laborer is worthy of his hire. 
If we require the teacher to give gymnastic instruction and play with 
the children, we ought not to forget that he has to care for others also,     
 
-P-A-G-E-411
  THE HIGHER SCHOOLS OF PRUSSIA. 383 
that he is a father, the head of a family, and has ehildren which he has 
not only to bring up, but for whom he must unfortunately too often 
labor outside of school hours, for generally his salary is not sufficient 
so that he can live free from care when he has any regard for the future 
of his children.” In conclusion Dr. Kropatschek made a sharp attack 
on Froebel, charging him and his system with propagating revolutionary 
ideas. This charge called forth a vigorous defense on the part of sev- 
eral of the succeeding speakers. 
Dr. Bertram, in opposition to the views of the other speakers, took 
ground in favor of the Fach-Lehrer system, or system of special teachers. 
He claimed that a specialist could teach better because he would be 
more thoroughly acquainted with his subject; that he would on the 
whole have as good if not better opportunities for judging the scholars, 
since, though he had each class only a few hours a week, yet as a rule 
he had the same class year after year; and, further, that the more ad- 
vanced the classes the more difficult it was to get a form master that 
could handle all the subjects properly, and finally in the upper classes 
it became almost impossible. Many spoke in opposition to the super-> 
vision of games advocated by the first speaker, but it was evident that 
their conception was different from his; he favored that free participa- 
tion, without any suspicion of authority that is now in practice, espe- 
cially in many of the private schools in the United States. Deputy 
von Schenkendorff had some facts to present. “In coéperation with a 
number of gentlemen distributed throughout the whole of Germany I 
addressed this year to five hundred cities the question: What is done 
in your place, outside of the instruction in gymnastics in the schools 
two hours per week, for the physical development of the youth? I re- 
ceived an answer from about three hundred and fifty communities. 
The result that only in extraordinarily few places is anything done 
outside of gymnastics; there is an extraordinary lack of playgrounds, 
and third, it was frequently said we have had playgrounds and plays © 
have been introduced, but all has been again given up.” 
Debate on questions 11 and 12.—These quest,ions referring to the prep- 
aration of future teachers and the codperation of the school with the 
family, were discussed in the session of Monday, December 15, a session 
memorable for the intense feeling manifested for the condition and stand- 
ing of teachers. The members of the conference who were not teachers 
were not slow to express their ideas as to what the teachers ought to 
be and to do, and the teachers for the most part took all these admoni- 
tions most kindly, but at last they asserted their rights, and repudiated 
their responsibility for all the sins of society. The debate on question 
11 was opened by Dr. Klix, who at the outset referred to the two kinds 
of teachers, specialists and form masters, and declared that any consid- 
ération of the proper preparation would have to be based on this dis- 
tinction. The subject was limited by the questions to the “ wissent- 
schaftliche” preparation which may be translated by “knowledge equip- 
i | 
         
-P-A-G-E-412
            384 EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
ment.” Intense specialization can not afford a proper preparation for 
the class teacher. He is so situated that his education can embrace a 
thorough understanding of the elements of several branches, and in 
addition the demands of a general education may retain their claim on 
him. It may be demanded of the future teacher that he become 
somewhat acquainted in the fields of philosophy, pedagogy, religion, 
and history, and that he acquire those attainments in the different 
subjects of instruction that will enable him to grasp the significance of 
each subject in its field, and thus to work in a manner that shall farther 
the concentration of instruction. As for the specialists, they should be 
educated in the universities; it would be folly to start seminaries for 
the training of teachers for the higher schools. But certain steps might 
be taken to make the university training more profitable. The candi- 
- dates who have occupied themselves exclusively in the university with 
the diplomacy of the Middle Ages and the reading of original documents 
of that period, and have studied only the memoirs of the eighteenth 
century, and who now on the ground of such studies with an inconsid- 
erable survey of the wjder field of history, have acquired some sort: of 
a certificate to teach—I can not bring myself to regard such candidates 
as capable teachers of history. * * * Itis not at all seldom that 
we see thatthe students have arranged their studies in a most wnskillful, 
and completely unmethodical manner, and the results appear in the 
examination; this want of purpose we find also with students who are 
energetic and earnest. I Wish this assembly would declare that it is 
an imperative necessity that students should be advised and directed 
as to the proper way of arranging their studies. If such a guide were 
put into their hands that they should see what subjects and in what 
order it would be best for them to pursue, they would attain far better 
results. * * * The student in the university ought not be troubled 
at all with practical preparation for teaching.” The further discussion 
of this question brought out little difference of opinion, and not many 
statements of great interest. Dr. Schrader opened the debate on ques- 
tion 12 in an interesting address, that was followed by a splendid speech 
from Dr. Hinzpeter. Both are worthy of translation and we can not 
refrain from extensive quotations. Said Dr. Schrader: “The school influ- 
ences the moral development of its pupils through the personal bearing 
of the teacher, which should always be characterized, not by pedantic | 
severity, which always borders on unreality, but by purity and dignity, 
combined with all inward cheerfulness, In a lofty consciousness of his 
duty, with pride in his calling he must keep himself far removed from 
every equivocal expression, from every act of passion, from every strug- 
gle for external luxury. He must keep clear of every outside agitation, 
_whether ecclesiastical, political, or social, and that also out of consid- 
eration for his own freedom; otherwise he loses his inward poise, and 
shakes the confidence of the parents. * * * I wish to demand fur- 
ther that there arise no foolish strife as to rights and limitations between 
the school and the home.”
-P-A-G-E-413
  THE HIGHER SCHOOLS OF PRUSSIA. 385 
Said Dr. Hinzpeter: “Home and family fulfill, alas, in the hurry and 
burden of the struggle for existence their natural duties ever less, ever 
more seldom. But I think it is impossible for the school to repudiate 
its duty here to step in and aid. It takes control of the scholars to a 
very considerable extent; itreally governs their entire existence in and 
out of school * * * That the school can educate only indirectly, 
through the instruction imparted, is unquestionable; but I think the 
school can do more in the way of educating through the instruction; 
the teachers ought not to content themselves with going over and im- 
pressing their lessons; they must go further and make them of use in 
the formation of the scholar’s character. They must know how to look 
out and make available the educating power that lies in every subject. 
If this second activity was exercised as skillfully and zealously as the 
instructing, then the influence of the schools would also be more intense 
and would find more recognition, and the cry for reform of the schools 
and school plans would be by no means so loud. For deep down every 
human being who is halfway gifted with a sense for education knows 
that it really matters very little after all what the scholar learns, but | 
how he learns it and adapts it for his own nourishment. * * * [I 
should like to say with conviction that every school reform, even 
the most thorough, must remain ineffectual without a school-teachers’ 
reform. Now I am certainly the last one who would wish to speak evil 
of the teachers, Iam very proud that I am the son of a schoolmaster. 
For, gentlemen, I believe that the schoolmasters are the true salt of 
the earth. But that can not prevent me from lamenting that so many 
teachers, are, to use a well-known figure, mechanics when they ought 
to be artists, artists in thehighest sense of the word, who are called to 
ereate the most noble monuments out of the most costly material. But 
that this may be possible, a number of things are necessary that are 
at this moment too often missing. Above all would it be necessary 
that the teachers should feel that they were a special class with the 
high calling of training the young, for whom studies and learning were 
but tools for the higher work of education—a class which, like other 
classes, groups itself around a center of teachers’ families, with their 
own class honor and class self-consciousness, in which, as in the fami- 
lies of officers, the proper talents and the proper virtues of the class 
are inherited. And further, every member of this class would regard 
it as his highest happiness and his greatest honor, not so much to in- 
crease his knowledge a little here and'there, but to accomplish his 
higher purpose, his aim as an educator in its truest sense, to discover 
those elements in his subjects that were morally elevating, and to use 
them for the welfare of his scholars, It is true that to a certain extent 
directness may be given for such efforts and objects, for such an ar- 
tistic treatment; * * * but the teacher, with his talents, his beliefs, 
even his habits, remains of much greater importance. It is well known 
that in no other calling does the personality have so direct an effect as 
ED 90. 25

in the calling of the teacher. Therefore, in theory the best of ‘the na- 
tion are just good enough to be the trainers of the young. But, gen- 
tlemen, in practice also it would be very desirable if all teachers were 
well born and vigorous, devout and cultured, men inspired and endowed. 
for their calling. Then would the moral influence of the school show 
itself strong enough; then would the school accomplish its higher duty 
of educating quite as well as it now fulfills the duty of instructing. 
But, alas, such ideal men can not be created at will and artificially. 
But, atleast, I think, we may guard against this—that where they do 
exist they may not be frightened away from the calling in which they 
would be the most needed, and that, when they have once entered this 
class, they may not be oppressed and eramped in their development by 
its conditions. The teacher’s calling has too long, Iam sorry to say, 
been, so to speak, a dishonorable trade. Pardon me the expression, 
which is meant, of course, only in an historical sense. I grew accustomed 
toit in very hard times. The profession of teaching has most decidedly 
worked itself vigorously out of the false position into which it was 
brought by the travelling pedagogues, the unsuccessful theologians, 
and other doubtful elements and unfavorable circumstances, and I 
see clearly from many indications that it will continue to toil up- 
ward. But, gentlemen, I think it would be wise and just to help it 
in this just so far as possible, especially if, as it seems will be necessary, 
we are to demand of it still more intense labor, still greater exertions. 
It is indeed true that the State can not remove the hard, vexatious, 
petty, and troublesome-work, with the danger it brings of pedantry and 
embittering; but I think that it could at least alleviate other needs 
and eares that oppress it. Anxiety for sustenance and social neglect 
still hold the teachers down and hinder them in the free development 
of their powers, and therefore also in their efficiency. In that, then, 
and in that alone, can the State help; and therefore, gentlemen, I 
think it is its sacred duty to do so.” Dr. Paehler thought that there 
were two sides to the question. If the school was to help the family, so 
- also was the family to help the school. “The method of bringing up 
at home is very often altogether unhealthy and unnatural. Therein, 
and not in overcrowding, is to be sought the cause for the ever-increas- 
ing nervousness among our youth. * * * Tf children are so brought 
up that they are continually excited and irritated, that they are offered 
enjoyments for which they are not ripe, nervousness must be the con- 
sequence, and, what is worse, it limits all the efforts of the school in the 
field of moral training.” Dr. Kropatschek presented some interesting 
figures. . In the year 1890-91 there was expended in Prussia on the ele- 
mentary schools (from state funds) 55,822,310 marks—in round numbers, 
2marks per capita; for universities, 7,732,308 marks—per capita, 0.27 
mark; for the higher schools 5,734,959 marks—per capita, 0.20 mark. 
That is all that the state of Prussia does for the higher schools. The 
expenditure in the other states of Germany for the higher schools was,

in 1877—in Bavaria, 0.50 mark; in Alsace-Lorraine, 0.70; Hesse, 0.66; 
Wiirttemberg, 0.92; Saxony, 0.63. 
Address of the Tinegeror at the close of the Conference.—The final ses- 
sion was held on Wednesday, December, 17, the Emperor being pres- 
ent. The thirteenth question was discussed and voted upon. The 
Minister of Education asked permission to close the proceedings, when 
the Emperor arose and addressed the Conference: 
At the assembling of the conference I was not for a moment in doubt as to its 
course and results, and I wish to-day at the close of your labors to express to you 
my most complete satisfaction and gratification that you, with honest toil and in 
an open exchange of thoughts and opinions, have reached the goal toward which I 
directed you, and that you have appropriated and followed the thoughts which I 
indicated to you. Will you allow me, before we close, to touch a few more points 
that may be of interest to you? 
As I hear, you were astonished that religion was not mentioned by me at the open- 
ing. Gentlemen, I supposed that my views, my ideas and thoughts, concerning re- 
ligion—that is to say, concerning the relations of every man to God—what they are 
and how sacred and holy they are to me, lay so clearly open to the gaze of all that 
everyone among the people knew them, I will, of course, as King of Prussia, as 
well as summus episcopus of my church, hold it as my most sacred duty to provide for 
cherishing and increasing the religious sentiment and Christian spirit in the school. 
Let the school esteem and honor the church, and let the church on her side stand by 
the school, and help it forward with its work; then shall we together be in a position 
to fit the youth for the demands of our modern civic life. With this I think I have 
completely covered this point. 
I can give my full approval to all that you have decided upon. I should like to 
mention one thing. The question of the leaving examination is not yet quite clear, 
and on that point I expect later another expression concerning the views and pro- 
posals of the minister. 
Gentlemen, we are in a period of transition, progress into a new century, and it 
has always been the prerogative of my house—I mean my ancestors have always 
shown that they, feeling the pulse of the time, have foreseen what would come. 
Then they have remained at the head of the movement, which they were resolved to 
direct and guide to new goals. I believe that I have recognized whither the new 
spirit, and whither the century that is just ending, tend, and I am resolved, as in 
taking hold of social reforms, so also here in reference to the bringing up of our com- 
ing generation, to tread the new paths that we inevitably must tread; for if we 
should not we would be compelled to in twenty years. Therefore you will all have 
a feeling of particular satisfaction and joy that you were the ones who were chosen 
to fix the basal principles of our new career, to work with me to open the new 
way in which we will lead our youth in the future; and I am conyinced that the 
blessings and benedictions of thousands of mothers will be called down upon the 
head of every one of you who have sat in this conference. I except no one, neither 
those who have labored to advance my views, nor those who with severe struggles 
and the surrender of that which they had hitherto considered themselves right in 
following, have brought a sacrifice—all these I thank. May the sacrifices that they 
bring give them also the feeling in time to come that they have accomplished an im- 
portant part in this work. 
Gentlemen, although as a rule I do not willingly read aloud, I should like to pre- 
sent to you an article which I consider so noteworthy, which I deem so well written, 
which renders my thoughts so completely when I spoke to you some fourteen days 
ago, that I wish to read to you the most important sentences. It was published in 
 
-P-A-G-E-416
  388 EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
the Hanover Courier for the 14th of this month. Under the heading ‘“Misunder- 
standings” are found the following sentences: 
“He who has become fully conscious of the powerful contrast between then ang 
now will, at the same time, be filled with the conviction that the new civic life is 
worth being preserved, and thatit is a task worthy of a man’s full powers to eo- 
operate in the preseryation and further development of this civic life. That the 
greatest freedom must be left to the teacher in the presentation of an unpleasing 
past is self-evident; but it is quite as self-evident that only those are called to be 
the teachers of our youth who stand loyally and with complete conviction upon the 
‘ground of the monarchy and the constitution. A partisan of a radical Utopia is no 
more useful as a teacher of the young than in the offices of the National Govern- 
ment. The teacher is, according to his duties and his rights, preéminently an offi- 
cer of the state, and, moreover, of the existing state: In the active discharge of 
the duties of his position the teacher would, to a great extent at least, have already 
accomplished that which is required of him toward making the youth capable of 
resisting subversive endeavors. ‘The further question of an active care for the 
formation of character, of an independent thought and judgment, as well as the 
question how far our present body of teachers fulfills the duties as here sketched 
for them, we will speak of another time. But no one can seriously think that the 
doctrines of social democracy can be discussed singly in the schools, and either by 
authoritative expression or in free discussion refuted. Whoever is permeated with 
a clear understanding of the nature of the state, of the origin and progress of our 
state, will be in a condition to see through the absurd, the objectionable, and the 
dangerous elements in the theory and practice of social democracy, and he will rec- 
ognize it as his duty manfully to assert his place in the ranks of those who defend 
our state from hostile attacks from within as well as from without. It remains the 
supreme task of the Government to preserve the lasting sympathies of all temper- 
ate and judicious classes by intelligent advances in the sphere of the public welfare 
and freedom. - 
“Another complaint that is based upon misunderstanding is this, that destruction 
is threatening our entire classical culture. We believe it is not the true friends of 
this culture who give expression to this fear; at least we can not spare them the 
reproach that they have only a very superficial idea of what is to be understood by 
the phrase ‘classical culture,’ ” 
Gentlemen, the man who wrote that understood me, and I am grateful to him that 
he has sought to diffuse these views among the people. 
Permit me to say one word concerning our military educational institutions, the 
cadet schools. They have been brought forward here as examples, and the wish has 
been expressed that their organization might be transferred to the other higher 
schools. .Gentlemen, the cadet corps is something unique, has a definite purpose, 
exists independently, stands directly under me, and does not concern us here in the 
least. , 
To resume briefly, I should like, before I close, to mention another foundation 
principle of our house which has been cited to-day by a prominent member: Suum 
cuique, that-is to say ‘‘to each his own,” and not “the same for all.” That principle 
we are following here in this assembly and in that which you have decided. Hith- 
erto, if I may so speak, the way has lead from Thermopylae by way of Cannex to 
Rossbach and Vionville. I would lead the youth from Sedan and Gravelotte, by way 
of Leuthen and Rossbach, back to Mantinea and to Thermopyle. I believe that is 
is the right way, and that way we must go with our youth. 
And_ now, gentlemen, my heartiest thanks and my most complete acknowledg- 
ment for all that you have hitherto done. Ihave embodied my thoughts and my 
commands for the further development of this matter which is so near all our hearts 
in a cabinet order, which I will now ask the gentlemen to listen to.

CABINET ORDER READ AT THE CLOSE OF PROCEE: 
  INGS, 
Tt has filled me with joy and satisfaction to have been a witness of the earnestness 
and devotion with which all the members of the conference summoned for discus- 
sion of the school question have contributed to advance this matter which is so im- 
portant for our nation and is especially sonear to my heart. I can not therefore re- 
frain from expressing to all the members my full appreciation and my royal thanks. 
My best thanks are due you especially for the no less skillful than vigorous direction 
of the proceediugs. I am glad to be able to say that the hopes which I cherished at 
the beginning of the deliberations have been brought essentially nearer their fulfill- 
ment through the results reached. In order to be able as soon as possible to come 
to definite conclusions on the basis of the rich and valuable material obtained for 
the accomplishment of the work of reform, I call upon you to submit to me as soon 
as possible plans for the formation of a committee, consisting of from five to seven 
men, to whom will be given the following task: 
(1) To look through the material, to examine it, and to report in the shortest 
time possible, and 
(2) To inspect individual institutions well known as especially good for the pur- 
pose of completing the material gained, on the practical side. 
I give myself the hope that it will be possible for you to prepare and lay before me 
on the basis of these preliminary labors a plan for the important reforms in the sys- 
tem of higher instruction, with reference also to the necessary financial measures, at 
so early a date that the new plan can go into effect on the 1st of April, 1892. I ex- 
pect that you will report to me from month to month concerning the progress of the 
matter. 
Ihave it in my heart to mention still one point. I do not fail to recognize that in 
carrying through the new reform plans considerably increased demands must be 
made on the whole body of teachers. I have confidence, however, both in their sense 
ef duty and in their patriotism, that they will give themselves with loyalty and — 
devotion to their new tasks. On the other hand, I consider it indispensable that 
the external relations of the teachers as a class, their rank and incomes, should re- 
ceive corresponding adjustment, and it is my desire that you keep this point espe- 
cially before yon and report to me on the same.

Reform committee.—In accordance with the recommendation con- 
tained in the cabinet order, the following committee was appointed: 
Chairman, Dr. Hinzpeter; Dr. Schrader, Dr. Fiedler, Dr. Graf, Dr. 
Kropatschek, Dr. Schlee, Dr. Uhlhorn. The committee met for the 
first time on January 6, 1891, again in February, and has been at work 
since; bat its proceedings have not been officially made public at this 
writing.’ 
} DECISIONS OF THE CONFERENCE. 
In regard to questions 1 to 4. 
I. 1, In the future only two kinds of higher schools are to be retained, 
namely, gymnasiums with both ancient languages and schools without 
Latin (higher real-schools and higher burgher schools). 
2, At the same time it is desirable that for cities whose real-gymna- 
siums are discontinued suitable transition forms, according to local 
conditions, may be devised and instituted.      
-P-A-G-E-418
  390 EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
“If. 1. A common substructure for gymnasiums and schools without 
Latin is not to be recommended. 
2, At the same time until further discussion it is to be considered as 
admissible according to local needs. 
(a) To extend the existing uniformity in the three lower classes of the 
gymnasium and the real-gymnasium to Lower Secunda inclusive, while 
from Upper Secunda on the programme of the higher real-school is 
followed. 
(6) Or to advance the Latin in the real-gymnasium to lower Tertia 
and to amplify the threo lower classes without Latin into a higher 
burgher school. 
TH. 1. It is desirable to diminish the total number of hours of in- 
struction in the gymnasiums. 
2. A diminution of the hours of instruction in the ancient languages, 
in accordance with this purpose, is possible, if in general an introduc- 
tion into the classical writers is striven for as the chief object and gram- 
matical exercises serve substantially as means thereto. 
The diminution in the total number of hours ought to fall in part 
upon ancient languages and in part upon other branches. 
3. Latin composition as a prime accomplishment is to be dropped. 
4. Greek transposition exercise for Prima is to be dropped. 
5. The introduction of English into the gymnasiums is recommended, 
elective or obligatory, according to local conditions. 
6. It is reeommended to make drawing in the gymnasium obligatory 
above Quarta (to upper Secunda inclusive). 
7. It is recommended to drop drawing in Sexta. 
8. Under all circumstances the greatest emphasis is to be laid upon 
the instruction in German, the number of hours is to be increased so 
far as possible, and above all perfection in German expression is to be 
aimed at in all lessons, especially in translation from foreign languages. 
9. A more thorough treatment of the recent history of the Father- 
land is to be obtained with proper limitation of the other historical ma- 
terial, without increasing the number of hours hitherto devoted to the 
instruction in history. 
The conference expresses to the royal administration of schools its 
most respectful and warmest thanks for the declaration made at the 
beginning of its deliberations, that it desired to promote a greater 
freedom and variety in the programmes and instruction of the indi- 
vidual schools, according to the particular needs of the same, in the 
conviction that precisely in this way the higher school system would 
be advanced in an especial degree. 
In regard to question 5 it is reeommended— 
(a) In places where there are only gymnasial or realgymnasial insti-. 
tutions to introduce instead of Latin in the three lower classes, accord- 
ing to local requirements, increased instruction in German and modern 
languages in additional courses.
-P-A-G-E-419
  THE HIGHER SCHOOLS OF PRUSSIA. ont 
(b) In places where there are only higher schools without Latin to 
add instruction in Latin in the three lower classes, according to local 
requirements. Z 
(c) To reduce all institutions with seven grades (progymnasiums, 
real-progymnasiums, and real-schools) to six-grade institutions, and to 
set a leaving examination at the close of the sixth year of these classes. 
(d) To shape the programmes of the real-schools and higher burgher 
schools alike, and arrange both so that without detriment to the differ- 
ent methodical treatment of the subjects of instruction and to the 
termination of the course of study, their continuation in the higher real- 
schools may be made easier. 
In regard to question 6 it is recommended to introduce at the com- 
pletion of the sixth year in the institutions with a nine years’ course 
_of study an earlier relative ending, out of consideration for those pupils 
who enter life before the completion of the nine years’ course. ; 
In regard to question 7. 
1. The highest number is to be reduced even in the lower classes to 
forty scholars. i 
2. A higher school should. neyer have more than four hundred 
scholars. 
_ 8. Parallel divisions are to be avoided as much as possible in ie 
higher classes. 
4, The separation of Tertia and Secunda according to years is, as a 
rule, desirable. 
5. The number of hours for the scientific teacher ought never to ex- 
ceed twenty-two per week. 
In regard to questions eight and nine. 1 
1. The diminution in the number of hours per week of instruction 
proposed by the conference ought not to cause as a consequence an in- 
erease in home work. 
2. The transferring of the chief work to the school made necessary 
by this proposition demands an improvement in the methods of teach- 
ing. 
3. The following prerequisites for fulfilling the demands made on 
teachers and scholars are indispensable, even if they must in exeeution 
be-suited to local conditions (with the exception of the desired reduc- 
tion in the size of classes): 
(a) Pedagogical preparation of the teachers. 
(b) Better position of the teachers in all their outward relations. 
(ce) Limiting of special teaching and the greater responsibility of the 
class teacher for the physical and intellectual welfare of his pupils. ° 
(d) Fostering games and bodily exercise, which latter are to be re- 
garded as daily tasks; especially, therefore, increasing and elevating 
the instruction in gymnastics and imparting the same where it is pos-, 
sible by teachers belonging to the institution. 
(e) Favoring the care of the body and fulfilling the demands of school 
         
-P-A-G-E-420
    ooee EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. $ 
hygiene, control of the latter by a school physician, instruction of the 
teachers and scholars in the principles of school hygeine and in the 
first means of aid in case of accident. 
4, Instruction in the open air for natural science and for local ge- 
ography and history is to be furthered in every possible manner. 
In regard to question 10, 
1. The final examination in the higher schools is to be retained. 
2. This is to be regarded as an examination under Government 
supervision for promotion out of Upper Prima. It is to be connected 
with the work of this class and to be limited to its lessons. 
3. Allthe scholars of Upper Prima who have been long enough in the 
class to be entitled to do so should take part in the written examination 
unless they are unanimously excluded by the faculty as immature. 
4, The simplification of the final examination is to be obtained— 
(a) In the written examination by introducing a translation from 
Latin in the place of the Latin composition, 
(6) By dropping the consideration of Greek and French transposi- 
tion in Prima. 
(c) By omitting Latin conversation in oral examination. 
(d) By omitting geography in oral examination. 
(e) By dropping written and oral examination in Hebrew. 
(f) By excusing from examination in religion and history in case of 
good class record. 
5. A mathematical or a mathematico-physical thesis belongs to the 
written examination, which shall consist in solving a mathematical 
exercise or in the comprehensive exposition, explanation or criticism 
of truths and propositions taken from the mathematical or mathe- 
matico-physical instruction. 
6. It is recommended also to excuse students from oral examination 
in ease all the examination papers without exception are satisfactory, 
7. It is recommended that more definite provisions be made in regard 
to the admissibility of substitutions. 
8. In the supplementary examination of graduates of real-gymna- 
siums, theses only of the same kind as those of the graduates of gym- 
nasiums are to be prepared. In the written examination that in ancient 
history is dropped. 
9, The simplification in the final examination for real-institutions will 
be arranged by the educational administration corresponding to the 
regulations for gymnasiums. 
10. If the right to one-year military service is made conditional on 
passing the examination for the completion of Lower Secunda, it is rec- - 
ommended to shape this examination in the same way as in the corre- 
sponding six class schools. 
In regard to question 11: 
1. Fundamental changes touching the scientific preparation of those 
preparing to be teachers in higher schools are not demanded.
-P-A-G-E-421
  THE HIGHER SCHOOLS OF PRUSSIA. 393° 
2. The university and its means of culture have hitherto proven 
themselves sufficient for their scientifie preparation. 
3. It is recommended to give students the necessary direction by pre- 
paring courses of study with instructions, 
4, It may be expected that on the part of the university the practi- 
cability of the studies of these plans will be correspondingly assured, 
and especially that provision will be made for more general and com- 
prehensive lectures on different scientific subjects. : 
5. The assembly greets with satisfaction the proposed course of the 
educational administration for the further preparation of teachers; for 
example, beginning the course in archeology, offering traveling schol. 
arships, ete. 
6. School instruction in living foreign languages is to have the duty 
of leading to thorough oral and written use of the same. The univer- 
sity instruction in the same branches has the duty to increase as much 
as possible ability in this direction. 
In regard to question 12: 
The higher institutions of learning may influence the moral culture 
of their pupils— 
1, Independently— 
(a) By careful general discipline. 
(b) By cherishing and fostering religious tendencies, both by means 
of instruction in religion and by means of appropriate school devotion. 
(c) By suitable application of the moral and patriotic subjects’‘in the 
instruction in history and in explaining authors. 
(d) By sympathetic adaptation to the individuality of the scholars 
(which presupposes moderately filled. classes). 
(e) By limiting the system of special teachers. 
(f) By the typical deportment of the teacher thoroughly trained as 
an educator. 
2. In cobperation with the family— 
(a) In the discipline and supervision of the pupils outside of the 
school, 
(b) By tactful home-visiting. 
(c) Through the school regulations and school celebrations. 
Parents are to be encouraged in a suitable way to such associations. 
3. The effectiveness of the teaching class depends on a suitable posi- 
tion and remuneration of the same. 
4, On account of the high significance of the instruction for confirma- 
tion (communion instruction), it is the duty of the school to further the 
same in every manner, and especially to arrange for a suitable time for 
the same. 
Itis recommended that every school day should be begun with a short 
devotional service. 
In regard to question 13: ss 
1, A certificate of maturity from the gymnasium qualifies for all univer-
-P-A-G-E-422
  894 - EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
sity studies and for admission to the examinations, presupposing such 
studies for officials in the state and church service, including the medi- 
cal profession, as well as for admission to the higher branches of mining, 
architecture, mechanical engineering, marine architecture, the postal 
service, and forestry. 
For study in a technical high school a certificate of maturity from a 
gymnasium is to be supplemented by proof of sufficient skill in draw- 
ing and sufficient knowledge of mathematics and the natural sciences. 
2. A certificate of maturity of a school of realistic character with the 
nine years’ course qualifies for studying in the technical high schools 
and for university study of mathematics and natural sciences, as well 
as for the higher branches of mining, architecture, mechanical engineer- 
ing, marine architecture, the postal service, and forestry. 
For admission to the studies and examinations indicated under (1) a 
certificate of maturity of a school of realistic character of the nine years’ 
course is to be supplemented by proof of sufficient culture in the an- 
“cient languages. 
_ 3. The certificate of maturity of the higher schools of six classes qual- 
ifies for entrance to the entire subaltern service. 
Until further provision a certificate of maturity based upon the ground 
of an examination for Upper Secunda answers the same purpose for 
scholars of ninth-grade institutions. . 
In so far as individual civic callings demand specific special knowl- 
edge and skill more than the general amount of school instruction, the 
right is reserved of providing special examination for admission. 
4. A certificate of maturity of the sixth-grade institutions, as well as . 
an examination satisfactorily passtd at the close of Lower Secunda of 
the ninth-grade institution, gives the right to one-year voluntary mili- 
ag service, 
. According to the calling which the gymnasium graduate ‘wished 
to ‘follow, it is left to the administration to excuse him in part or com- 
pletely from supplementary real examination in case of a specially good 
certificate of maturity from the gymnasium. 
According to the calling which the real-school graduate wishes to 
follow it is left to the administration to excuse him in part or completely 
from supplementary Gymnasia examination in case of a specially oo 
certificate of maturity from a real school. 
6.-The possibility is to be left open to eyery possessor of a certificate 
of maturity from every ninth-grade higher school of obtaining admission 
to such Government examination as his certificate of maturity does not 
entitle'him to enter. For this purpose during the period of study he 
must pass a special examination (Fachexamen), 
7. Along with the new regulations of the system of privileges that 
will be inevitably necessary an effort should be made to open, as far as 
possible, a way to an equal estimation of the humanistic and realistic 
culture. .
-P-A-G-E-423
  THE HIGHER SCHOOLS OF PRUSSIA. 395 
In regard to question 14: : 
As soon as the need for higher burgher schools is increased by grant- 
ing greater privileges, and also by the regulation that the right of one- 
year voluntary military service can be obtained in the other higher 
schools, also only by examination, the following general provisions are 
recommended for satisfying the need: 
1. The former gymnasial and real-gymnasial institutions, from which 
it is shown that no considerable number of scholars go over to the higher 
schools of gymnasium or real gymnasiums, are to be transformed into — 
buargher schools. 
2, A similar transformation is to be carefully considered in the ninth- 
grade gymnasial and realgymnasial institutions in which the vast ma- 
jority of students do not go beyond Lower Secunda and whose Upper 
Secunda and Prima do not have any attendance justifying the contin- 
uation of a complete institution. ’ 
3. In cities which possess several gymnasial and realgymnasial insti- 
tutions of learning measures are to be taken so far as possible to trans- 
form one of these institutions into a higher burgher school. Considera- 
tion is to be had especially that in founding a new school a higher 
burgher school shall be established. 
4, In cities which as yet possess no higher institutions of learning, 
preference is to be given to theghigher burgher school in establishing 
the same. : 
5. To protect the interests of the minority of the inhabitants where 
there is no school teaching Latin, Latin instruction has to be added in 
the three lower classes (question 5, b). 
6. The State is to support the establishment and maintenance of 
higher burgher schools according to the same principles as hitherto gov- 
erned the gymnasial institutions. During the period of transition, es- 
pecially, the Stateis to further higher burgher schools by the application 
of Government means and to come to the financial aid of the less 
capable cities in founding such institutions. : 
7. The average support of scientific teachers in the higher burgher 
schools as well as in all institutions of six grades is to be made equal 
to that of teachers in the nine-grade institutions. : 
8. The name real-school is recommended for the higher burgher school; 
_it indicates at the same time its relations to the higher real-schools. 
In regard to question 15. 
For the control of instruction and education in the higher schools 
the existing organs of supervision are sufficient. Impending changes 
in education and the increase in the laborof the officials of supervision 
made necessary thereby make an increase in the number of provincial 
school councilors earnestly desirable. . 
Observations on the proceedings of the conference.—First of all one is 
struckin looking over the stenographic report of the discussions by 
the dignified and courteous tone that characterizes them. Although 
   
-P-A-G-E-424
  396 EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
the speakers represented the most widely differing views, though many 
of them in the course of the proceedings saw their favorite plans 
erushed and their life-long customs encroached upon, still courtesy and 
good temper seemed never to fail. The educators that met in this con- 
ference had undoubtedly been themselves truly educated. 
Nothing was more prominent in the proceedings than the sharp dis- 
tinction between Hrziehung and Unterricht, between education in its true 
senseand instruction, This difference has been referred to briefly in 
the preface. The speaker in the conference always spoke of education 
as meaning the total forming of a human being in not alone mental, but 
moral, physical, and religious relations as well. Instruction was every- 
where subordinated to education, discipline, training, development. 
Such phrases as “ Not what but how a child learns is the important 
matter” occurred over and over again. “ Character-Bildung,” the for- 
mation of character, was put aboveall, ‘“Allgemeine-Bildung,” general 
education, was put far above technical instruction. The teacher was 
to be an Erzieher, one qualified to bring up and develop all the fac- 
ulties, to touch and stimulate all the many sides of a child’s nature. 
In this connection religious instruction was often and earnestly consid- 
ered. There was an unmistakable conviction present in the minds of 
the members that the youth of the land were not receiving that relig- 
ious grounding, were not going into lifg with the religious convictions 
that they should have, and therefore there was a good deal of feeling 
that more ought to be done in the way of religious instruction in the 
schools. Anything that looked toward an apparent lessening of the 
emphasis on religious instruction, such as, for example, the proposal to 
drop the final examination in religion, was strongly opposed not only 
by the clergymen in the body, but also by a majority of the teachers. 
There was, of course, entire unanimity as to the necessity of retaining 
religion as a subject of study in the public schools; indeed, no one so 
much as suggested that any other course was possible. At the same 
time, it was unmistakable that the results obtained were far from satis- 
factory. The conference often seemed more like a Sunday school con- 
vention than a meeting of public school men. 
Latin was more considered than any other subject of instruction, 
perhaps more than all others together. Latin and not Greek is the 
heart, the center, the core, of the gymnasium. There was little said . 
about Greek, at least about the instruction in that language. Such 
modifications: as were proposed met with little opposition. But any 
change in Latin was sharply debated. 
Every question and every side of a question gave opportunity, it 
seemed, for saying something about the condition of the teachers as a 
class and the necessity for doing something to improve their condition. 
The question of improving the qualifications of teachers and giving 
them better preparation for their work, awakened apparently little in- 
terest and caused scarcely any discussion, It seemed to be the thought
-P-A-G-E-425
THE HIGHER SCHOOLS OF PRUSSIA. 397 
of the conference that the teachers were already better than the state 
deserved to have until it did more for them, And they were very chary 
about giving any expression that might look like imposing additional 
labor upon the teachers. Over and over and over again, relevantly 
and irrevantly, in season and out, the bettering of the material cireum- 
“stances of the teachers was urged earnestly and intensely. When 
finally Dr. Bohtz, of the ministry of finance, told them that the finances 
of the Government were such that there was little immediate prospect 
of any improvement in the way of increase of salaries, and called upon 
the members, instead of complaining when they went home, to do all 
that they could to quiet the discontent of the teachers, a deep feel- 
ing of disappointment and almost indignation swept over the members. 
Dr. Bohtz was asked whether he spoke with the authority of the min- 
ister or only gave his own views, and Dr. Schrader, of the University 
of Halle, declared that after carefully thinking over Dr. Bohtz’s admoni- 
tion, he had been quite unable to see how he could do what was asked 
of him. The words of the Emperor in the final cabinet order, however, 
went far to inspire hope among the teachers. It is certainly worthy of 
consideration, when in Prussia, where all the professions are over- 
crowded as compared with our relations in the United States, out. of 
two hundred graduates only three chose teaching, as Dr. Kruse stated. 
A point of some interest to:teachers is the general approval ex- 
pressed by the members of the conference of the Klassen-Lehrer system, 
by which is meant the system of one teacher for each class, who gives 
the instruction in all subjects except, perhaps, drawing or some simi- 
lar technical subject. Only one spoke in favor of the Fach-Lehrer 
system, or system of special teachers. The English educational jour- 
nals translate Klassen-Lehrer and Fach-Lehrer as ‘form masters and 
specialists.” The employment of specialists has been growing in favor 
in the United States rapidly, and in private schools, atleast, isnow almost 
universal. In the lower classes in college, which compare with the 
upper classes in the higher schools of Prussia, specialists are, of 
course, exclusively employed. It is therefore not without interest to 
note the general favoring by these prominent Prussian educators of 
the form master, the teacher who remains with his class as long as 
they are in the school room, gives the instruction in all branches of 
study and maintains the entire discipliné. This plan, however, was 
not favored on the ground that it was better from the standpoint of 
instruction; almost the sole ground urged, and the one that seemed 
quite sufficient, was that of the superior influence in the way of de- 
veloping the character, in the way of Drziehung, that could thus be 
exerted by the constant contact with one man. Thus a definite force 
“would be brought to bear, whereas otherwise there »vould be so many 
differing forces that no definite and lasting impression whatever would 
be produced upon the scholar. 1t was not denied that, so far as pure 
instruction went, specialists could do better; but that was entirely 
secondary to the other and higher aim of the schools.

' The social democrats were only occasionally referred to, and that 
quite incidentally. It was evident that the members of the conference 
did not agree with the Emperor in thinking that the schools were re- 
sponsible. for the spread of social democracy. A note that sounds 
strange to American ears was often sounded in the proceedings, namely, 
the danger of increasing the educated class. We are so accustomed 
to hearing the ery of higher education for all who can possibly get it, 
so thoroughly imbued with the belief that education is in itself a benefit 
that men or women will be just so much better for having the high- 
est education they can gain, no matter what use’ they may afterwards 
make of it, that it sounds strange to hear it said that the best educa- 
tion must be carefully kept for the best people (Helmholtz), and that. 
merchants and others are positively damaged by having too good a 
training. The conviction of the conference was unmistakably-that a 
college education was not a good thing, except for those who were to 
be chosen to fill the highest positions in the state, in the church, and 
in society. The feeling of caste which prevents a graduate of a Pras- 
sian high school from entering a trade or going into business because 
the learned professions are of a higher social grade—this feeling, 
which, and not the organization of the schools, has produced the 
“hunger candidates”—is happily lacking in the United States. Until 
it develops—may that time never come!—it will probably not be neces- 
sary for the educators of the United States to discuss seriously the 
best means of scaring boys away from the high schoolsand colleges. 
Most of the speakers referred to their own school days, and said if 
things were now as they were then there would be no need for reform. 
The gymnasiasts were not only in the majority, but they were moreover 
the best speakers and debaters. Dr. Goring, the radical member, had 
little support and little sympathy, and his main address is evidently 
that of the leader of a lost cause. 
What were the net results? How much had the reformers gained? 
What party was satisfied? The strict advocates of the ancient classics 
complained of the threatened reduction in the classical instruction, 
The friends of the Realgymnasium were of course without any conso- 
lation. The friends of the union middle school saw scarcely one of their 
wishes fulfilled. All complaints united in the ery, “We will have more 
gymnasia and worse ones.”* The gain was not so much in any one 
great, striking change, unless the action in regard to the Realgymna- 
sia be considered, as in a multitude of items that tend to greater 
freedom in the programmes and less overcrowding for the scholars, 
IV.—SUBSEQUENT PROCEEDINGS. 
Views of a leading realgymnasiast.—Cauer, of Kiel, in the Preussischen 
Yahrbiicher speaks thus of the results: 
The old gymnasium has conquered; the realgymnasium is laid on the shelf; thus 
is the new condition designated. And, indeed, the existing realgymnasia are

reduced to the last extremity: they must either change themselves into gymnasiums 
by adding Greek or into real schools by dropping Latin. Such a development in 
itself would correspond to the interests of the realgymnasium, for Latin was a 
foreign element in the programme of the realgymnasium, its increase in 1882 a de- 
cided mistake. Since the opinion exists in many influential quarters that the transi- 
tion should be made gradually and not forcibly, and that regard should be had to 
local needs, the friends of the realgymnasium might well be contented to see these 
schools once more approached to the purer and fundamentally sounder form of a 
real-institution without Latin and with nine classes, provided that these were made 
capable of living by receiving the necessary external privileges. But precisely this 
provision fails. It is true the real-schools of hitherto (eleven in Prussia) receive an 
accession since the right of preparation for the nee branches of mining, archi- 
tecture, and machinery, that. was taken away from them in 1886, is given back again, 
and the right to prepare for the postal service and for forestry is fo be added. But 
the real-institutions as a whole suffer severe damage in that the right of qualifying 
their students for the study of the modern languages, that has hitherto belonged to 
the realgymnasia is taken away, and .at the SOS time the prospect is opened 
that they will lose the right of admission to the study of mathematics and the nat- 
ural sciences as soon as the instruction in Latin is entirely given up. When one 
considers with what difficulty the upper classes of the realgymnasium have main- 
tained themselves, even up to the present, there can be no doubt that with the 
privileges of the graduates actually diminished they will become deserted in the 
future. The consequence will be that not only the realgymnasia but all the nine- 
class real-institutions will gradually disappear, with perhaps the exception of iso- 
lated specimens in the great cities, and that at last the gymnasium will remain the 
sole institution that prepares for a higher career. Have the friends of the latter 
cause to rejoice on that account? At least the gymnasia can not lack pupils in 
the future. But there has never been any lack of that sort. ‘What of the pro- 
gramme? The complaint became at last universal that it was too diversified, that 
it did not aid the scholar to a symmetrical education of the intellect, but that it 
gaye a multitude of facts that were soon forgotten; that the scholars in Prima and 
Secunda could not reach a fresh and enjoyable reading of the ancient classics, because 
they had to vex themselves so much over the grammar that the multitude of differ- 
ent requirements had led to an unendurable overloading with home work. These 
are all earnest and, as we must admit, fully justified complaints. In order to redress 
them the conference has decided to increase the number of studies a little more by 
making drawing obligatory in the middle classes and introducing English in the 
higher classes. But that is not the only contradiction. The instruction in the an- 
cient languages is to be made more intense and more successful and at the same 
time shortened by several hours a week. The whole number of school hours per 
week is to be reduced and at thesame time the amount of home study diminished by 
transferring the principal work in learning to the school. Finally, all these impos- 
sibilities are to be made possible by improving the methods of instruction. Our 
Emperor certainly spoke from the heart when, in his opening speech, he condemned 
those schools that further a half-culture and thereby create an incompleteness for 
life. This judgment would apply to none of the existing kinds of schools so well ° 
as to the gymnasium if it should be organized. according to the conclusions of the 
conference, It will be answered that at least one discordant feature from which the 
present gymnasia and realgymnasia suffer will disappear in the future, the right to 
one-year voluntary military service. In reality definite declarations of the minister 
of education had aroused the liveliest confidence in this respect. .All the more pain- 
ful is the disappointment in just this point. The important privilege of dismissing 
scholars after the sixth year of the course with the right to one year service is to 
remain with the nine-class schools, but its exercise is to be limited in that in its 
place a special examination is to be introduccd. So the splitting of the nine-year

course which, without intention on the part of any one, has been gradually prepar- 
ing under the influence of the one-year right is finally completed. But is not all the 
harm outweighed by the fact that in future the aspirants for uniforms will generally 
turn their backs on the gymnasium and go to the higher burgher school? This hope 
was at least often expressed in the conference, but on what it is based has not been 
said, If gymnasium and higher burgher school are alikei in this, that in both the one- 
year certificate can only be obtained by a special examination, wat are different, in- 
that the burgher school prepares only for entrance into the subaltern service while the 
six lower classes of the gymnasium bring about entrance to the higher gymnasium, 
and so the admission to all the higher professions, one need be no prophet to foresee 
that parents will give preference to the gymnasium in the future quite as much as 
they have in the past. 
Changes in the cadet school.—In a special order of the 13th of last 
February the Emperor recommends achange of the course in the cadet 
school in the following respects: 
(1) The end and aim of all education, especially of the military education, is the 
formation of character, resting on the harmonious codperation of physical, scien- 
tific, religio-ethical education and discipline. No side of education should be made 
prominent at the cost of others. Butat present the scientific programme of the cadet 
corps, according to my observations, makes too extensive demands upon a large 
number of pupils. The course must be simplified -by the exclusion of every unessen- 
tial detail, especially by thoroughly sifting the memory material, so that even the 
less-gifted pupils may be able with suitable diligence to follow the instruction without 
overpressure, and to complete the entire course in theprescribed time. What the in- 
struction loses in this extent by this means it will gain in thoroughness. The teach- 
ers in all branches and in all grades will immediately have to adjust their methods 
in this respect. 
(2) In every simplification, however, the instruction must be made still more 
practical, so that the cadets not only may gain the knowledge and skill immediately 
necessary for the military calling, but also may obtain a mental equipment which 
will render them more capable themselves to exert in the future a moral and in- 
structive influence in the Army, the great-school of the nation, or in case they should 
later enter another than the military calling to fill their places there also. 
In religious instruction the ethical side must bo made prominent, the chief stress 
laid upon educating the pupils in the joy of faith and the fear of God, to strictness 
toward themselves, to patience toward others, and upon establishing them in the 
conviction that the practice of fidelity and devotion to ruler and fatherland, as well 
as the fulfillment of all duties rests upon divine commands. 
The instruction in history, more than hitherto, must give a knowledge of the pres- 
ent, and especially the position of our fatherland in it. Accordingly, German his- 
tory must be more strongly emphasized, especially that of modern and most recent 
times, but ancient and medieval history must be taught in such a manner that the 
pupils shall be impressed with examples of heroism and historical greatness even 
from those epochs, and also obtain an idea of the roots and development of our 
culture. 
Geography, political as well as physical, while beginning in the lowest grades 
with the home must first of all supplement and support the historical instruction in 
the different grades. The further end of geographical instruction is to bind the pu- 
pil most intimately with his fatherland, but also to teach him to understand and 
value foreign lands. ~ 
German becomes the center of the entire instruction. In every subject the pupil 
must be instructed in the free use of his mother tongue. Even in the hours devoted 
to German, as well as in the instruction in literature, in the choice of the pieces for 
reading, in lectures and essays, special consideration must be given not only to clas- 
  &

sical antiquity, its legends and culture but also to German legends and the litera_ 
ture of the fatherland, and the pupil should also be made acquainted with the men- 
tal life of other important civilized nations of the present, by an introduction to 
separate masterpieces of their literature. 
In the instruction in modern foreign languages, the stimulation and instruction 
of the cadets in the practical use of the languages should be kept in view from the 
first grades. 5 
The programme of the cadet corps, as revised according to this order, lays special 
stress upon modern languages and modern history. Of the 20 hours devoted to 
history during the gymnasium course, 16 are devoted to modern history since 1415 
(geography is taught with history in prima and ober-prima), and only 2 hours 
to ancient and 2 to mediwval history. Of the 136 hours devoted to languages, 50 
are for Latin, 21 for English, 37 for-French, and 28 for German. Much instruction 
' in the mother tongue is given also of course in the other branches, 15 hours are 
devoted to geography, and the remaining 117 hours are divided among the following 
subjects—teligion, mathematics, natural history, physics, chemistry, drawing, and 
writing. 
This order is deemed especially important because in it the Emperor has shown: 
hishand. It contains his freely expressed opinion. The reformers see in it the . 
beginning of the end, and maintain that while the change is intended first for the 
Cadettenanstalten, the Emperor’s purpose is to extend it to other schools. By a 
simple order the Emperor can change the programme of the cadet corps; but time 
and ‘indirect methods are demanded to effect any great change in the publie 
schools.—[W. H. Burnham in Pedagogical Seminary.] 
Attitude of the educational administration—How uncertain the atti- 
tude of the educational administration is may be seen from the remarks. 
of the Government Commissioner Standar, in the debate of the commit-, 
tee on education late in May. After denying that the conference had- 
been formed in a one-sided and biased manner he observed that in ma- 
terial directions the decisions of the December conference after they 
have received the highest sanction form a fixed point of departure for. 
the further decisions of the administration. The great pedagogical 
issues, however, which connect themselves with the “ greatest possible 
equal valuation of the humanistic culture with the realistic” must be 
weighed still more thoroughly by the ministry of education before a 
definite conclusion can be arrived at. If the reform of the schools is 
begun on the basis of the decisions of the conference the administration 
has nevertheless the intention of striving for a gradual clearing up of 
the questions involved, which can not be solved theoretically by means 
of further practical experiments. The entire procedure of the adminis- 
tration in the matter of reform, in agreement with the conclusions of 
the conference, will be marked by a far-reaching attention to the inter- 
ests of the scholars, the parents, and the communities. 
From this it is seen that the decisions of the conference are a “ fixed 
point of departure” for the educational administration, but at the same 
time it has come to no conclusion concerning the great pedagogical 
issues, : 
Attitude of the association for school reform.—At Pfingsten, 1891- 
Whitsuntide, the Verein fuer Schulreform (Association for School Re, 
form) held its general meeting in Berlin. In his report the president 
ED 90-——26 
             
-P-A-G-E-430
  ~ 402 EDUCATION REPORT, 1869-90, 
stated that after the school conference the association had. directed its 
efforts to demonstrating that the demands of the Emperor could not be 
fulfilled in the way indicated by the conference, The petition from the 
association, with which the committee of education had recently occu- 
pied itself, and which would shortly come before the House of Depu- 
ties itself, furthered this object. Moreover, a direct petition to the 
Emperor had been prepared, which prayed that the school reform might 
take the shape of a common six-class substructure for all the higher 
schools. In the Prussian cities, with only a single high school, this 
petition had been signed by seventy magistrates, fifteen of them being 
from cities in which the single high school is the gymnasium. 
The meeting adopted the following resolutions: 
1. Whereas His Majesty the Emperor, at the beginning of the December confer- 
ence, made German the basis of the future higher school instruction, and wished to 
see the national spirit furthered more. and more in history, geography, and legend, 
and demanded moreover that the scholar should be prepared for the practical life of 
to-day, and that the amount of intellectual labor should be lessened in favor of 
physical development, and that the number of Gymnasia should be limited and the 
examinations simplified, His Majesty has thereby indicated to the higher school sys- 
tem the lines for a flourishing further development. 
2. The December conference, in its attempt to adapt itself to these demands, has 
not entered upon the way for a hearty recognition of the same by an organic.trans- 
formation of our higher school system. It is rather to be feared that its conclusions 
as they are now clearly to be recognized tend to the strengthening of the monopoly 
of the gymnasium with all its evils; do not demand enough with respect to the de- 
velopement of “the national spirit; stop far behind the demands of practical life; 
inerease the overloading, and in spite of that allow neither the culture valve of the 
linguistic-historical nor of the realistic branches to attain their full worth. 
8. The Association for School Reform stands now as before firmly by the pro- 
gramme of the united six-class middle school as the common substructure for all 
three existing classes of higher schools, with such a standard that the need of a 
Latin preparation forthe later pupil of the Gymnasia and Realgymnasia shall be sat- 
isfied from under tertia without increasing the number of hours. The association 
holds this programme to be the only practical way of meeting the demands of the 
Emperor, and for terminating the agitation for school reform in a manner that 
promises to be lasting. 
As important preparations for this end it greets the decision of the conference to 
endeavor to introduce a closing point after the first six years of study, and the 
promise of the government to allow a greater freedom and diversity to prevail in the 
programme and instruction of individual schools according to particular needs. 
Still more important does it seem to the association with respect to its programme 
that by the complete equalization of all three classes of high schools, the free capac- 
ity of which may be demonstrated, and especially that through numerous practical 
attempts in Gymnasia and Realgymnasia, it may be shown with what success the 
beginning of instruction in the two ancient languages can be postponed to higher 
classes than before. 
- Action of Frankfort.—In March, 1891, the city council of Frankfort- 
on-the-Main decided to send a petition to the Prussian minister of edu- 
cation. The main points of the petition were: 
(1) That the minister should permit the city to maintain its Realgym- 
nasia untouched by the reform which seemed to be demanded. 
 
-P-A-G-E-431
  THE HIGHER SCHOOLS OF PRUSSIA, _ 403 
(2) That in one of the two city Gymnasia, as an experiment, the in- 
struction in Latin should be begun in lower tertia, and that in Greek 
in lower secunda. 
Action of the Association of Saxon Engineers and Architeets—The 
Association of the Saxon Engineers and Architects, meeting on the 1st 
of June in Dresden, adopted the following report: In the belief that 
the proposed school reform for Prussia will not remain without influence 
on the school relations of Saxony, the Saxon Engineers and Architects’ — 
Association declares: 
(1) The preparation for the study of the technical science must aim 
at the same amount of intellectual ripeness as is required for the study 
of the old faculties, 
(2) The existing nine-class Realgymnasia in Saxony answer this de- 
mand, and therefore give no occasion for reform. * 
(3) The nine-class Realschool, without Latin, and destined in Prussia. 
for the preparation of technical man, is, on account of its preponderat- 
ing realistic stand, been less suited for preparation for the study than 
the humanistic gymnasium. For, if the latter lacks certain advantages 
for preparation of technical studies, it still offers in every case the re- 
quired measure of intellectual ripeness; the latter should therefore 
have the preference. 
(4) As the goal for the school must be worthy to be striven for, in 
Saxony also, the nine-class Gymnasia, with the united substructure 
and separate higher schools in each of the six lower classes (sexta to 
lower secunda), agree completely in their study programmes, and the 
separation according to the humanistic and realistic sides takes place 
only in the three higher classes (higher secunda, lower and higher 
prima). = 
(5) To attain this goal the equal qualification of both sister institu- 
tions, humanistic and Realgymnasia, through admission of their grad- 
uates to all studies, is to be striven for. 
Debate in the Committee on Edueation of the Chamber of Deputies.— 
The substance of the petition presented to the Prussian Chamber of 
Deputies was to the effect that the reorganization of the higher school 
system planned to go into effect April, 1892, should be eut loose entirely 
from the conclusions of the December conference, and turned into the 
direction proposed by the association; that is, a union school with six 
classes, branching into three divisions, which should correspond to the 
present Gymnasia, Realgymnasia, and higher Realschools. 
This petition received the careful consideration of the committee of 
education. Deputy Seyffardt (national liberal), who reported on it, 
agreed with the views of the petitioners, that the former minister of 
education had not kept the promise made in the session of March 20, — 
1890, to call together a commission of inquiry composed of typical rep- 
' resentatives of the different tendencies; that he had given undue prom- 
inence to the ancient classical humanistic tendency in the same, and 
 
-P-A-G-E-432
  404 EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
that he had entirely suppressed the lay element beneath the professional 
element. The agreement of the old gymnasial majority with the 
demands of the Emperor and King was a purely formal act, and on both. 
external and internal grounds could never lead to the reform in the 
German and modern spirit which should correspond to his wishes. The 
conference, as has been frequently claimed in the press and never con- 
tradicted, gave the appearance of having been summoned to aid the 
advocates of the supremacy of the classical gymnasium to a bloodless, 
victory. 
Among the educators there were against ten directors and teachers 
in Gymnasia only two directors of Realgymnasia and three of other 
real institutions. It was certainly not an enviable position in which 
these highly honorable men, eminent scholars and lights of their pro- 
fession, saw themselves placed, when, after the opening of the confer- 
ence, they became aware that they must labor under presuppositions 
which were essentially different eon the purposes for which they had 
been called. 
Quite as surprised were ae representatives of the ministry of war, 
which, in the intention of meeting the views of the Emperor, had pro- 
vided a memorial for the conference that emphasized the necessity of 
_ giving further privileges to the real gymnasium, whose course is iden- 
tical with that of the cadet schools. The recognition of this necessity 
. by the war ministry was the result not alone of the conviction of the 
excellence of these institutions. It was also for the interest of the 
army not to see the numerous officers who were obliged to leave the 
service on account of the required reduction in age shut out from-em- 
- ployment and positions for which they must be considered capable, on 
aecount of their preparation. These facts gave unmistakable proof 
that the unfavorable opinion of the Emperor concerning the Realgym- 
nasia came to him only in the last moment. 
Least of all could the hundreds of thousands of men in practical 
life, whose sons form nine-tenths of the scholars in our higher institu- 
tions, with all due respect for the persons called together in the con- 
ference (among whom are only two of their own class), recognize an 
authority which was at all competent to decide upon their needs and 
to put inte practical execution the reform ideas of His Majesty. ‘The 
practical execution of the views of the conference was not possible 
without the agreement and codperation of the Diet. Previous unfortu- 
nate experiences suggested the greatest foresight, and it is greatly to 
be feared that the monopoly of the Gymnasia will be increased in an 
unheard of manner. It was urged in opposition of the assertion of the 
petition that the conclusions of the conference would not prepare a way 
for the carrying into effect the views of His Majesty, that the shelving 
of the Realgymnasia was not in opposition to the views of the Em- 
peror. That was only apparently to the purpose. His Majesty wished 
the truth and the right way to attain it. If the Realgymnasia could
-P-A-G-E-433
  THE HIGHER SCHOOLS OF PRUSSIA. 405 
be called a new work it was still old enough to have conquered for 
itself in the course of its historical development during sixty years the 
right of existence. The affirmation that higher real schools served the 
ends of industrial callings immeasurably better than the Realgymnasia 
was altogether and completely unjust, since all the elements whose 
social position made necessary codperation in the affairs of the commu- 
nity, province, and state could not dispense with a certain sympathy - 
with the culture of the learned, involving, at least, the knowledge of 
one ancient language. 
The discussion in the committee took a somewhat wide range. There 
was by no means unanimous agreement in the views of Deputy Seyf- 
fardt, though the sentiment of the committee on the whole sympathized 
with him. It was voted to refer the petition to the Government as ma- 
terial for framing future legislation. 
Remarks of Dr. von Gossler’s successor.—In a debate in the Chamber 
of Deputies in reply to certain critisms of Deputy Schmelzer, the new 
Prussian minister of education, von Triizschler expressed himself as - 
follows in regard to the question of school reform: 
Deputy Schmelzer has brought forward the weak points in German education in 
a drastic manner. In reply, I would call attention to the fact that the purposes of 
the recent movement is to do away with these evils, and that the complaints of 
Deputy Schmelzer might better ,be directed, not at.the central administration, but 
at-individual educational institutions. The regulations are already so shaped that 
we may expect from every graduate a thorough training in German. For the most 
part I can agree with the Deputy Virchow, in his remarks, but I believe that his 
unfavorable criticisms on the present reform movement arises from a wrong con- 
ception of what is intended. So far as Ihave been able to study the results of this 
zeform movement, up to the present time, the anxieties that he has expressed in re- 
gard to the Realgymnasium is without foundation, The educational administration 
at least, and especially I myself, are quite clear on this point, that in the sphere of | 
the school system there can be only an organic continuous development from the 
existing and cherished order, and that there can be no question whatever of anir- + 
regular interference with, and complete overflow of, the regular school institutions. 
Isay this with the express intention of having it heard in the country, in order that 
the manifold anxieties which have been aroused, especially with regard to the Real- 
gymnasia, may be dissipated, 
A rule should not be given to the individual teacher, as is the case in other states, 
according to which he must adjust himself so that the instruction in every institu- 
tion is each day the same, and one can say, ‘to-day Cesar is read in all the schools, 
and to-morrow, Ploetz.” But complete free will is also impossible. The middle 
line between absolute regulation and complete freedom will surely be the best, and 
to attain this will not be the task of the minister of education alone, but all the local 
boards will have to codperate thereto, But if Deputy Virchow complains especially 
in the case of the Realgymnasia that further privileges have not been granted them, 
I would reply that the educational administration is not to blame for that, but 
rather the universities. But this shall not so cramp the new reform but that prac- 
tical experiments in different places, if possible in all the Prussian provinces, shall 
be made with the proposed new order of things. I place so much importance on this 
point that I have already conferred with the gentlemen of my ministry as to how 
such practical experiments can be arranged. I am of the opinion that the whole 
question can not be finally decided fora long ‘time to come, and that the scientific 
  , 
      s 
   
-P-A-G-E-434
  406 EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
examination and the practical attempts must be carried out much better than is pos- 
' sible to-day. 
‘That does not exclude us from reaching out our hands to improve in many directions. 
I consider it necessary that our youth should have a freer exercise of their physical 
powers through further extension of the system of gymnastic training, and that our 
teaching class must be elevated in regard both to its internal and external conditions. 
We will not make these things dependent upon the legal regulation of the reform 
of the higher school system. It is not to be doubted that the latter is constitution- 
ally demanded, and I recognize the duty of striving to attain it most fully and com- 
pletely. But 1 believe that, after the representations that I have- given, it would 
be a false way to combine the new reform of the systems of higher schools with the 
common-school system. In that case I would be treading the same path as my pred- 
ecessors, who attempted that, and I would not find it possible, no matter how long 
it might be my privilege to occupy this position, to reap the benefits in respect to 
the middle and higher classes of the experiences which I consider must be had before 
we can arrive at a legal determination of the question. 
Therefore I beg that, if I mentioned in my inaugural address the necessary legal 
regulations, to consider that I intended this, so far as its practical execution was 
concerned, to refer to the common schools only. I have declared myself in favor of 
_ that. The regulations of the higher school system I will reserye for subsequent 
action. 
_ Effects on attendance.—A member of the committee on education is 
authority for the following figures, which show the disquieting effects 
of the decisions of the Berlin conference in the circles whose sons have 
hitherto attended the Realgymnasium: 
In Dortmund, a city having a gymnasium, real gymnasium, and a 
higher burgher school, the number of new scholars received by the Real 
gymnasium at Easter was, in 1886, 70; in 1888, 82; in 1890, 111; in 1891, 
44, The number of scholars who ‘eft at Easter for various reasons was, 
in 1886, 40; in 1888, 42; in 1890, 40; in 1891, 67. 
The number of scholars in Sexta was, in 1886, 58; 1888, 60; 1890, 83; 
1891, 36. The number who left to go to other schools was, in 1886, #s 
1888, 12; 1890, 13; 1891, 38. 
; me the real gymnasium in Cassel 117 new scholars were received in 
1890; in 1891, but 71. In 1890 there were 94 in Sexta; in 1891, 70. 
The real gymnasium in Charlottenburg received about 100 new 
scholars at Easter, 1890, and about 50 at Easter, 1891, The relation 
holds true of the real gymnasium in Frankfort. 
Action to be taken by the Government.—A decisive step in reference 
to the carrying into effect of the school-reform project is about to be 
taken in Prussia. The most important pre-requisite for school reform 
on the basis of the determination that was arrived at by the December 
conference and approved by the Emperor is the new regulation of the 
system of privileges of the higher schools. The Reichs Anzeiger says 
(July 27) that this question has been thoroughly treated by exchange 
of letters between the different ministries and in sittings of the minis- 
try of state, and the agreement has been arrived at that the graduates 
(abiturienten) of the higher real schools in Prussia shall-be admitted to 
the arcitects’, machinists’, miners’, and foresters’ callings, as well as to 
 
-P-A-G-E-435

the study of mathematics and the natural sciences, with a view to posi- 
tions as teachers. The same would be true in the state service, for the 
postand telegraph systems, marinearchitecture, and marine engineering. 
A higher real school will thus be made essentially equal, so far as privi- 
leges are concerned, to the Realgymnasia. As for the higher burgher 
schools, their certificate of maturity will in the future admit to the entire 
subaltern service, while this was previously the case only in regard to 
the judicial subaltern service. Thus, the higher burgher schools will 
be able to take root in sections, which are comparatively little devel- 
oped in industrial directions. The right to one-year voluntary military 
service will be so regulated that the advantages previously possessed 
by scholars of the nine-year institutions, as well as of the seven-year 
institutions, of being able to acquire the certificates of this right merely 
by promotion to Higher Secunda, will cease. In the future, in these 
institutions an examination will be held under direction of the state 
commissioner at the close of a six-year course, and the obtaining of a 
eertificate for the one-year service will be made dependent on passing 
the same. Through this the inequality which has hindered the exten- 
sion of the higher burgher schools will be done away with. Hitherto 
they required their graduates to go through a complete examination in | 
order to obtain a certificate. Now a practical experiment will be tried 
as to whether the Realgymnasia will be able to maintain their position 
by the side of the higher real schools under the changed circumstances. 
APPENDIX. 
PROGRAMMES OF THE HIGHER SCHOOLS OF PRUSSIA, BAVARIA, WUR- 
TEMBERG, SAXONY, AND BADEN. 
In the federation of Germany public instruction remained the affair 
of the individual states. Each state of the Empire has, therefore, an 
independent school system. These various systems, however, resemble 
one another closely, and the Prussian system has had a preponderating 
influence on them all. There are,nevertheless, considerable differences. 
The Allgemeine Zeitung, of Munich, in commenting on the Emperor’s 
speech at the opening of the conference, dwelt with pride on the fact 
that education in the Bavarian gymnasia corresponded very fairly 
with the Emperor’s ideal. Dr. Uhlig called attention to these differ- 
ences also in the conference. In speaking of the charge that the 
  gymnasium did not afford the most suitable training for the study of : 
medicine, he said he had asked university professors in regard to that 
point, and they had admitted that there was a marked difference in the 
preparation of graduates of the gymnasia of different countries, espe- 
cially Bavaria and Baden. The resemblances and the differences are 
both made clear by the following programmes:

  THE FINAL RESULT. : *    
  The February number (1892) of the London Journal of Education 
contains the following editorial article, which states the results of the 
deliberations of the special committee, mentioned on p. 389: 
          
  The new time table for Gymnasien in Prussia, which comes into force next Easter _ 
(1892), may be regarded as a compromise between the advocates and opponents of 
classical teaching. It reduces the hours assigned to instruction in Latin by 20 per 
cent, while the reduction in Greek amounts to 10 per cent only. The difference is 
      
      
-P-A-G-E-444
    A416 EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
due, not to any preference for Greek, but to the belief that a much greater reduction 
would-render the teaching of the Greek language practically ineffective. The voices 
raised in favor of Greek instead of Latin as the basis of school instruction are few 
and far between, Latin has been the primary school subject in Germany for a thou- 
sand years. It has at all periods exercised a powerful influence on German litera- 
ture, and its disappearance would leave a great gap in the educational system. 
Just at this moment nothing could take its place in higher education. No subject 
has been so carefully adapted, by long molding and remolding, for the general 
purpose of mental discipline and as an introduction to the study of language. The 
student of modern languages at the university would be helpless without this pre- 
liminary training. The establishment of secondary: schools without Latin so far 
does not contradict this view. 
Now, Greek is really an intruder into the school programme. It was indeed 
taught, but not as a compulsory subject, before the beginning of this century. It 
was in 1812 that Greek was first made obligatory for students proceeding to the 
university, and it took its place thenceforward a8 a necessary part of school in- 
struction. 
It is noteworthy that the giants of Greek scholarship grew up under a system of 
noneompulsion, Heyne, Wolf, Lachmann, Bickh, Bekker, Hermann, and that the 
great impulse which Greek communicated to German literature under Goethe and 
Schiller was also earlier in point of time. The objections to the study of Greek 
from a practical point of view may be thus summed up: 
(1) Pupils are detained too long at the gymnasium. The average age of grad- 
uates is 19} to 20. They remain on in order to pass the necessary examination to 
qualify for the university, Very few of these intend to study classics at the uni- 
versity. It may fairly be said that Greek entails two additional years at school. 
(2) Attention is diverted from the subjects which are of practical importance, or 
health suffers under the effort to carry on all subjects alike. 
(3) A preponderant amount of time is necessarily given to the study of dry gram- 
matical details, disgusting to the pupil, and taking away his attention from the 
study of the literature. Nor is the success such as to justify this expenditure of 
time and labor. (In fact, complaints are general that the real mastery over gram- 
matical forms, which is attained in Latin teaching, is never attained in Greek. 
These complaints are likely to be louder under the new time table.) 
Some practical teachers, who wish to retain Greek in schools, have strongly ad- 
vocated the inductive method. This is a variation on the well-known plan by which 
the translation of a portion of some author is first mastered, and grammatical in- 
struction is given as required. This system was advocated by Herbart, introduced 
by him in Gottingen, and carried out under Ahrens in Hanover. Geh.-Rath Dr. 
Lattmann, author of the excellent Latin grammar, gives an interesting account of 
Herbart’s method in a pamphlet on this method of teaching, which hex strongly ad- 
vocates. Some countenance is given to it in the new time table. 
Other teachers advocate the free use of ‘ Versionen,” i. e., ‘ cribs.” A more thor- 
ough-going proposal is to give up the study of the language altogether, and to de- 
vote two hours weekly to an organized study of Greek authors in translations (Prof. 
Bahnsch). We may add that in schools the writing of Greek prose and verse is a 
thing of the past; only very simple exercises survive for grammatical practice. 
For the moment such radical proposals as the last mentioned are out of court. We 
must wait for the working of the new time table, and when the results attained are 
weighed and estimated, it will be time to take further steps. Meantime these ideas, 
which outstrip the general current of opinion in influential circles, serve to show the 
set of the stream. 
Now, it must be remembered that. one and the same authority determines what 
shall be taught in school and university. If a change in the school plau is determ- 
ined; it-ean at once be extended to the university. 
     
   
-P-A-G-E-445
    THE HIGHER SCHOOLS OF PRUSSIA. AIT 
Tn direct connection with the university are schools of three classes: (1) Wholly 
classical—Gymnasien—with Latin and Greek; (2) Reaigymnasien, with Latin; 
(3) Oberrealschulen without Latin. 
Those who have passed the final examination (Maturitdts Examen) at gymnasien 
are free to study in any of the four faculties at the university: theology, law, medi- 
cine, philosophy. 
Those who pass from realgymnasien are admitted to study in the philosophical 
faculty, but are excluded from the faculties of theology, law, and medicine. 
By the new regulations issued in December, 1891, to come into force after Easter, 
1892, the certificate of graduation from the Oberrealschule admits the holder to study 
mathematics and natural science at the university. And he is further entitled ‘to 
present himself for examination as a candidate for the post of teacher at higher 
schools.” Thus the last classical barrier is completely removed, and entrance to the 
university is free to all who can show that they haye attained a high intellectual 
standard. 
It will have been seen that the conditions of entrance depend on the status of the 
school from which the student proceeds. Greek and Latin are absolutely exacted 
from the pupil of the gymnasium, and Latin from one at the realgymnasium. It is 
only those who proceed from the Oberrealschule who are exempt from both. 
The struggle has gone on for along time. The majority in the universities in 1869 
opposed the concession to the realgymnasium; but public opinion backed the goy- 
ernment in granting the privilege. The agitation for greater freedom is still active. 
It may be said that all parties are unanimous in favor of requiring Greek for stu- 
dents of theology and classical philology. As to the faculties of medicine and law, 
opinions are divided. Perhaps those in favor of retaining Greek for jurists are more 
numerous than those who would lay the burden on medical students. But popular 
opinion, and a large body of professional men also, would set both free. 
Considerable regret is felt among teachers at the admission of students without 
knowledge of Latin to the universities, and consequently to the ranks of a profes- 
sion which prides itself on its intellectual standard. Latin, of course, symbolizesa 
certain grade of culture. 
But the change was inevitable. The reply to objectors is based on a broad princi- 
ple The universities belong to the nation. All who have attained a sufficient in- 
tellectual training have aright to enjoy the benefits to be derived from a prolonga- 
tion of their studies. Nor would it be right to exclude an able teacher from the 
higher walks of his profession because he way not have one particular taste in com- 
mon with his colleagues. - 
In this, as in all walks of life, exceptional talent will prove its own justification. 
It is, perhaps, a little remarkable to find the Government more liberal in tone than 
the universities; that is, taking a wider view of national requirements—and it must 
be added, taking a juster view of what is meant by intellectual culture. It is well 
known, too, that the government is so far from lowering the intellectual standard 
that the state examinations are severe and ‘exacting. True intellectual culture is 
best promoted by a wise latitude. Nothing is more to be deprecated than the exac- 
tion of a mere pass qualification. It diverts the attention from serious study, and 
proves a source of infinite vexation and disgust. Nor is it just, nor in the long run 
possible, for a majority of the community to impose on the minority its own views 
of what may or may not be necessary for intellectual salvation.

1.—HisroricaL REVIEW. 
There was a time in Austria when the simplest conditions of educa- 
tion, such as we deem absolutely necessary in modern times, were the ex- . 
clusive privilege of the so-called “higher” or “better” classes of society. 
The classes were separated by barriers which could be scaled only by 
specially gifted men, and by them rarely with impunity. The clergy was 
the only class in which aristocracy of birth, wealth, and talent mingled, 
leaving, however, the aristocracy of birth in the supremacy. 
The people’s school (public elementary school) is an institution of 
modern time. Equal rights for all under the law is the principle which 
led inevitably to the establishment of public schools. The Middle Ages 
had no room for it; during the centuries which saw the great church 
reformation, the fact years’ war and its frightful results, the people 
had neither means nor inclination to carry on the war with ignorance 
and social injustice. At that time, and later on, Austria had universi- 
ties, Latin schools, aristocratic academies or private institutions for the 
wealthy, some city and a few convent schools, the trivial or German 
schools (so ealled in contradistinction to Latin schools); but the general 
Austrian public elementary school (people’s school), as an institution 
of rudimentary learning for privileged and nonprivileged classes for 
rich and poor, subject to the state’s supervision, following a prescribed 
course of study, that school is a creation of the Maria-Theresian era. 
Joseph I, son of Maria-Theresa, whose intentions for improvement 
were very sincere, died too young to complete the work his mother had 
begun, and the subsequent efforts of Austria in its struggle with Napoleon

I, prevented active promotion of popular education. During the “quiet 
years” from 1815 till 1848, the publie school did not seem to make much 
progress, since it was. at the tender mercy of the lords of the soil and the 
elergy, who thought that educating the masses would emancipate them 
unduly. : 
The year 1848, which saw the people’s uprising, brought, at last, 
that which a Prussian king had given to his people from a sense of 
self-preservation after the defeat of his armies in 1806, Extinction of 
feudal privileges held by the aristocratic lords, liberation of the small 
landowners from intolerable burdens of taxation, formation of home 
rule in communities (township government), and a constitution for the 
empire—these were, in the main, the results of the year 1848. The 
author of the first bill for public education in 1848, Under-States’-Sec- 
retary E. v. Feuchtersleben, whose book on “Dietetics of the Soul” 
- became very popular, was not an educator, but he had great enthusi- 
asm for education and high ideas. Subsequent attempts at framing a 
school law took this draft as a model. s 
In 1849 a separate department of education was created and Count 
Leo Thun was the first Austrian minister of public instruction. At 
this time M. A. Becker was made general superintendent of the schools 
of Lower Austria.. Vernaleken was called from Switzerland to aid 
the minister, and Krombholz became chief of the section of elemen- 
tary schools. The activity of these men was directed towards improy- 
ing the profession of teaching, but leaving the teachers to choose their 
own methods; they called the teachers together to meetings for the 
discussion of professional topics in order to raise their professional ed- 
_ ueation; prolonged the.normal-school course from one to two years; 
furnished the profession with a suitable book of methods, and in every 
way provided the schools with their most important feature, namely, 
teachers. The minister also planned to have an approved set of text- 
books prepared. Experienced schoolmen were sent to Switzerland and. 
progressive states of Germany to investigate the conditions of public 
education in those countries, and on their return to propose improve- 
ments. All these things were undertaken and only needed time to 
ripen into beneficent action, when, alas, the conservative cabinet, with 
Schwarzenberg as chancellor, checked the workin progress. The consti- 
tution granted by the Emperor in 1848 was withdrawn and the influ- 
ence of the conservative party became more powerful than ever. In 
consequence of the “Concordat” (agreement) entered into with the 
Pope on August, 1885, the elementary school of Austria was again 
placed under clerical supervision. The course of study in preparatory 
elasses of normal schools was shortened; natural history, physics, me- 
chanics, geometry, and architectural drawing were omitted entirely, 
geography and history confined to mere knowledge of the native coun- 
try and its history. In 1853 the topics to be discussed in teachers’ 
meetings were limited to those that concerned the interests of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-449
    EDUCATION IN AUSTRIA-HUNGARY IN 1889-90. 421 
schools of the respective districts. In 1854 Austrian teachers were pro- 
hibited from attending meetings of the “National German Teachers’ 
Association.” A decree of 1856 forbade the teachers to teach “ other 
knowledge, or in any other manner, or to a greater extent, than was 
suggested in the prescribed text-book.” Even arithmetic was ‘Te- 
stricted to the four fundamental rules and their application in practice. 
Notwithstanding all these restrictions, which would seem to us in- 
tolerable, the impetus which the schools and their teachers had received. 
through the eventful years 1848 and 1849 could not be entirely over- 
come. The ideas expressed in the memorable National Parliament at 
Frankfort (German Austria was part of Germany till 1866) and the 
press acted like leaven, and secretly the teachers and local influence 
upheld the ideals formed, so that when more than thirteen years later a 
change in the government took place which made rapid progress possi- 
ble the Austrian public elementary school took an upward start which 
occasioned great surprise. 
In 1861 the Emperor granted the people a new constitution, and with 
it. factors came into activity which quickened the educational life of 
Austria. Nevertheless it took more than eight years before great - 
memorable improvements were undertaken. No agency worked harder 
or more to the purpose than the city government of the capital, Vienna. 
The city council demanded from the Government a separation of the 
management of schools from political affairs, a system of well-organized 
normal schools, and as a postulate of local government local manage- 
ment or supervision of the schools. At the same time Vienna began 
to reform its own schools. In March, 1862, gymnastics were introduced, 
the teachers’ salaries increased, better qualification of teachers demanded 
from the Government, new school buildings erected, and all the existing 
city schools provided with objects for the successful teaching of ele- 
mentary science and natural history. The city council appointed a com- 
mission and charged them with supervision of the schools and their 
reorganization, This committee has become a permanent branch of the 
city government. 
During this period the teachers aided all attempts at reform and gave 
expression to their wishes and opinions. It may be said that the Aus- 
trian educational press had its beginning in 1861 and 1862, The first 
teachers’ association of any note dates from that time, and many Aus- 
trian teachers took part in the great memorable meetings of the “‘ Na- 
tional German Teachers’ Association” in Gera (1862) and in Mannheim 
(1863). They brought home glowing descriptions of the flourishing 
schools in Germany, and thus incited their Austrian brethren to greater 
efforts. In monster petitions to the Government they set forth these 
ideals and taxed themselves to establish private courses of scientific 
and professional study. 
The Government could not remain deaf to the general desire, and 
conferred with. the-teachers.in. Vienna and.other parts of the country.
-P-A-G-E-450
    422 EDUCATION REPORT, 1839-90, 
An immediate result of this was an attempt at promoting the normal 
training of the teachers. The minister of education decreased the 
number of candidates for admission te normal schools, increased the 
course of study, and prescribed more vigorous examinations for teachers’ 
diplomas. In 1866 a commission was appointed for the purpose of re- 
vising and improving the text-books used in elementary schools. At 
every step taken the teachers were consulted, and rarely was anything 
done contrary to their wishes. 
Vienna was first to press forward. The city authorities petitioned 
Parliament to reorganize the normal schools and thus make improve- 
ment in the schools possible. In February, 1864, the city authorities 
resolved to establish several advanced elementary city schools (Biirger- 
schulen), and the year 1866 saw the completion of a system of schools 
similar to the French superior primary schools. In order to secure 
well-equipped teachers for these higher schools a new superior normal 
school was established under the name of “Paidagogium,” the students 
of which had to be teachers in active service and graduates of common 
normal schools. Dr. Fr, Dittes, school councilor in Gotha, was called 
to preside over this school. Meanwhile the teachers all over the coun- 
try, aware of the fact that the schools were not up to the standard, 
passed resolutions to that effect ‘and petitioned provincial and state 
authorities in a manner that found attention in Parliament. Then 
eame the disastrous year of 1866, in which the Austrian army was so 
signally defeated within six weeks by the well-trained and educated 
army of Prussia. 
Among the memorable changes that reconstructed the entire Empire 
upon a more modern basis were several decrees (May 25, 1868), fore- 
runners of a law which did away with church supervision and placed 
in its stead local, district, and provincial school boards. With the ex- 
ception of religion the teachers were made independent of church in- 
fluence in all their instruction. The school was separated from the 
church, with which it had been in close connection, and the “Concor- — 
dat” with’ Rome was rescinded. On May 14, 1869, the present 
school law which defined the course of study was passed. This law 
is essentially the same asthat which is nowin force. Under it the schools 
of Austria have progressed more than was. hoped or expected by even 
the greatest optimists, What generations had neglected was done in 
two decades. The number of pupils increased astonishingly; many 
new schoolhouses had to be built. In order to show in a single item 
the progress made we may instance Vienna: In the year 1869 the num- 
ber of pupils in the lower schools was only 35,000. Ten yeats later it 
had risen to 61,000. The expenditures in 1869 rose from 400,000 florins, 
or $142,800, to 2,500,000 florins, or $892,500, within ten years. To this 
should be added the sacrifice which many poor parents had now to 
undergo since their children were retained in school two years longer 
than formerly. The financial depression occurring during the seventh
-P-A-G-E-451
    EDUCATION IN AUSTRIA-HUNGARY IN 1889-90. AO ey 
decade had its influence also upon the progress of the schools, other- 
wise it would have been still greater. 
The Liberal cabinet resigned in 1877 and was replaced by members 
of the Conservative party. This party favored autonomy of all the 
different nationalities represented in Austria. Thus the Bohemians, 
Hungarians, Poles, and others clamored for home rule, and the effect 
this political war had upon the school was anything but beneficial. 
Several attempts were made at modifying the school law, but the Im- 
perial Government protected it from assaults and allowed the schools 
to progress without troublesome interference. In many respects the 
institutions created by the law of 1869 are similar to the schools in 
Prussia. It is interesting to know that the public school has from the 
day of the passage of this law been called the “new school” (Neu- 
schule), a term which crept into the German and Swiss educational 
press, and shortly afterwards was used in this country in a modified | 
form as “new education.” 
The principle of local management of the schools is maintained by 
the law of 1869. There are three ascending authorities—local (Orts), 
county (Bezirks), and provincial (Landes) school boards—which may 
be likened unto three sieves. The local board has the largest inter- 
stices. City or village councils and school boards are largely made up 
of the same men; they hold their office without pay, and particu- 
larly dislike the work of enforcing the compulsory attendance act; 
hence the fact that, notwithstanding vigorous execution of the law, 11 
per cent of the children of school age escape enrollment. In cities, as 
a rule, a better class of men are found on the school boards. Social 
rank and education determine their selection to a great extent. But 
even in cities the machinery of government does not work as smoothly 
_as is desirable. The three governmental boards—board of aldermen, — 
city council, and school board—are often antagonistic to one another, 
and appeals to higher authority are frequent. The county board (or 
Bezirksschulrath) may be considered as being between the upper and 
nether millstone. It has to refute assumption on the part of the state’s 
authority, and coerce lower boards into action where inaction is more 
to the liking of the people. This county board, the members of which 
are all school officers or inspectors (Bezirks Inspectoren), performs the 
duties of supervision. Local supervision is nowhere found in Austria 
except in cities, where the schools are so numerous that they them- 
selves resemble a county system. To these difficulties in managing 
the schools, which are perhaps experienced in other countries also, are — 
added those arising from the heterogeneity of the population in Aus- 
tria. Often several languages are spoken in one and the same county, 
town, or village, and each nationality claims representation in school. 
That principle of the American common school which makes it the 
most effective agency of homogeneity, namely, the principle of teach- 
ing one language, and one only, is not accepted in Austria, where the — 
Slavic and Teutonic elements are constantly at war with each other.

  424 EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
2.—PRESENT CONDITION OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS IN AUSTRIA, 
It is impossible to sketch the various features of public education in 
Austria within the short space of a report; mere outlines must sufiice. 
‘The guiding idea for school legislation has been given in the constitu- 
tion as adopted and amended December 21, 1867, and May 25, 1868. 
Article 17 of the constitution says concerning the rights of citizens 
exactly what the Prussian constitution expresses, to wit: “Science and 
the teaching of science are free;” that is to say, free from one-sided con- 
fessional and political considerations, bound only by the eternal laws of 
truth and morality. These words have not only secured liberty of ac- 
tion to the professors in the university for the widest range of scientific 
investigation, but have equally benefited the institution that is des- 
tined to feed the juvenile mind with mere elements of human knowl- 
edge, the “ people’s school.” This was a great step forward from the 
“standpoint taken by Empress Maria Theresa and Emperor Joseph II. 
The school, which originally had been a church institution and was by 
the great Empress regarded as a “ politicum” (a political question) and 
placed under the care of the state, without, however, removing church 
influence, was now made independent. The entire school system in all 
its parts became a secular matter in 1867, and the state reserved the 
right of supervision, even that of instruction in religion. Religious in- 
struction, it is true, was not taken out of the hands of the clergy and 
put into the hands of the secular teachers, as was done in Prussia, but 
it remained in the hands of the clergy, except that now the law made 
the teachers of religion officers of the state as well as their secular 
colleagues, and subject to the law. 
The business of teaching is not restricted to any profession or con- 
fession. Every citizen who has proven his ability according to law—i. e., 
has passed certain state examinations—may teach in public schools or 
establish a school himself. Private education at home is not subjected 
to the law, as itis in Prussia. While thus the state reserves for itself 
the supreme supervision of all public schools, it grants a certain liberty 
for the development of the individual. 
Article 19 of the constitution regulates the relation between the dif. 
ferent nationalities according to the principle of free development. It 
says: “All nationalities in the state have equal rights, and each has 
the inalienable right to secure and maintain its language.” A conse- 
quence of this is equality before the law, in courts, in administrative 
offices, and in schools of all the many languages found in Austria— 
German, Polish, Slavonian, Servian, Bohemian, Ruthenian, Italian, 
Roumanian, and Hungarian. They are all regarded national languages, 
as German, French, and Italian are in Switzerland. From this state of 
affairs arise difficulties for the elementary and secondary schools which 
are not found in our country, nor in Germany, France, or England. 
Many an apparent abnormity found in the Austrian schools (and like-
-P-A-G-E-453
  EDUCATION IN AUSTRIA-HUNGARY IN 1889-90. 425 
wise in the Hungarian, where similar conditions for a long time pre- 
vailed) may be explained by this constitutional provision, which was 
dictated by pure humanity. 
The law of May 25, 1868, not only regulates the relations between 
school and church according to article 17 of the constitution, butit also 
defines the duties of the different authorities. The state exercises 
direction and supreme supervision over the entire system of public in- 
struction, through its agent, the minister of instruction. Below him 
stand next in rank the state superintendents (Landes Schulriithe) ap- 
pointed by the governors of the different states (provinces or crown- 
lands). Nextin rank below are the county school boards (Bezirks-Schul- 
riithe) selected from the ranks of professional teachers in elementary and 
secondary schools. The lowest position in the administration is occu- 
pied by the local school boards. 
The church authorities were allowed to continue their supervision of 
the religious instruction, but it was soon found that the dissatisfaction 
of the clerical party had to be met by allowing the church to establish 
parochial schools. These confessional schools (as they are called) are 
regarded as state schools as soon as they comply with the requirements 
of the law that prescribes the course of study and professional prepa- 
ration of teachers. Text-books for. religious instruction are to be ap- 
proved by: the church. 
The right to teach is not restricted to any confession or religion; 
neither is the child of any citizen debarred from attending the school 
of the district in which he resides, regardless whether the child belongs 
to the Roman Catholic, Greek Catholic, Protestant, Reformed Evan- 
gelical, Unitarian, or Jewish faith. In other words, the schools of Aus- 
tria are common schools, so far as religion is concerned. 
There are slight differences in the election, confirmation, and duties 
of the various supervisory and directive authorities, since the local 
affairs of the school in each crown land (state or province) are man- 
aged according to local legislation, but the law of 1869 fixed the prin- 
ciples according to which the schools of the Empire are to be governed, 
so that whatever differences occur are only of local importance, just 
as the individuality of our schools and. States is guarded by leaving 
school legislation to the separate States. 
In the following pages the present condition of the different grades 
of schools as expressed in statistics is given. There are some cu- 
rious things to be found in these statistics that will be interesting to 
American readers, 
One thing the reader will miss, a statement of expenditures. No 
reports on that point are available, notwithstanding the repeated ef- 
forts on the part of this Bureau to obtain them. The only definite 
statement procured is the amount the state pays (during 1891-92) for 
all school purposes, that is, elementary and secondary schools, univer- 
sities and polytechnica, and for special and art instruction, namely,

4,—ELEMENTARY EDUCATION. 
In Austria, that is, in Cisleithania, or the Western part of Austria- 
Hungary, elementary education is offered in 17,276 public and 965 pri- 
yate schools. No statistics concerning the latter, but minute accounts 
of the public schools are published by the Austrian “ Statistiche Central 
Commission,” from which the following statements are taken: 
Grading.—The public superior elementary schools in some cities are 
called “Biirgerschulen”’ (citizens’ schools), of which there were 425 in 
1889; the other public elementary schools are called “Volksschulen” 
(people’s schools), of which there were 16,851 in the same year. The 
distinction between citizens’ and people’s schools is very slight, and 
the citizen’s schools of Austria must be well distinguished from the 
citizen’s school in Prussia, where they are justly classed among the 
secondary schools. Of the people’s schools in Austria, 50.2 per cent 
were ungraded; 23.6 per cent had tivo grades or classes; 10.3 per cent 
had three grades or classes; 6.3 per cent, had four grades or classes; 8 
per cent had five grades or classes; 1.3 per cent had six grades or 
classes; 0.2 per cent had seven grades or classes; 0.1 per cent had eight 
grades or classes. ‘ 
Half-day schools.—Of 17,276 public elementary schools, 12,683 were
-P-A-G-E-455
    EDUCATION IN AUSTRIA-HUNGARY IN 1889-90.. 427 
kept open all day; 2,353 were half-day schools, while in 1,240 schools 
instruction was given partly half a day, partly the entire day; that is 
to say, some of the lower grades were so crowded that they had to be 
divided into half-day schools, while the upper grades had instruction all 
day: 73.4 per cent were whole-day schools; 19.4 per cent were half-day 
schools; 7.2 per cent were partly whole, partly half-day schools. 
Coeducation—Of the 17,276 elementary schools, 1,388 (8.03 per cent) 
were exclusively boys’ schools, 1,087 (6.3 per cent) exclusively girls’ 
schools, and 14,801 were mixed (85.66 per cent). 
Medium of instruction—The following table is instructive, in so far 
as it shows that in the greatest number of private schools German was 
the medium of instruction; in other words, that the German-speaking 
population maintains the greatest number of private schools, owing to 
the encroachments of the Slayic races upon the German, which the 
“German School Union” tries to counteract by establishing and main- 
taining private German schools. The language of instruction was—

Teachers.—In 1889, Austria had 60,126 teachers in the publie elemen- 
tary schools, 45,705 (or 76 per cent) men, and 14,421 (or 24 per cent) : 
women. Among the 45,705 men were 13,875 teachers of religion, 364 
of whom were appointed by school and 13,511 by church authorities. 
Among the 14,421 women 6,930 taught only knitting, sewing, embroid-_ 
ery, crocheting, ete., to the girls twice a week. If we deduct the 
teachers of religion and those of female handiwork, we find the actual 
number of school teachers to have been 31,830,(81 per cent) men and 
7,491 (19 per cent) women, a total of 39,321. 
Qualification of teachers.—During the year 1889 the teachers of the 
public elementary schools were not all properly qualified, but the pro- 
portion of those professionally prepared is gradually, though slowly, - 
increasing.

Salaries of teachers.—The salaries paid to elementary teachers in 
Austria are lower than those of similar grades of teachers in our coun- 
try, and also lower than those paid in Germany and France. While in 
large cities, such as Vienna, the teachers enjoy comparatively good in- 
comes, in far remote crown lands, like Tyrol, Bukowina, etc., they live 
in great want and poverty. Advertisements by local boards in Tyrol are 
published not unfrequently, calling for teachers at salaries of $70 to $80 
per annum, and even less for women. The city of Vienna has recently 
adopted a new schedule of salaries for the teachers of the middle and 
elementary schools, which is here reproduced to afford a standard of 
comparison with salaries paid in other capitals. In the following table 
four salaries are stated for each class of teachers, a first and a second 
grade of the new schedule, and a first and a second grade of the old 
schedule.

to the teacher was 72; if we count in the special teachers of religion 
and female handiwork the average number per teacher was 47.1. The 
corresponding numbers in 1887 were 73.3 and 48 respectively; in 1888, 
72.4 and 47.6. 
Enrollment.—While the census found 3,366,398 children in 1889 of 
school-going age, 2,831,667 (84.11 per cent) were enrolled in public 
elementary, 106,908 (3.18 per cent) in private elementary, 1,346 in asy- 
lums, 51,836 (1.54 per cent) in secondary or special schools, or were 
taught by private teachers, 22,048 (0.66 per cent) could not be enrolled 
owing to bodily or mental deficiences, and 367,769 normally equipped 
children escaped enrollment=10.99 per cent. Comparing the number 
of pupils in school with the population, we find that of every 100 per- - 
sonsin Austria 14.1 are of school age (6 to 14 years), but only 11.9 are 
enrolled in school. 
Compulsory education—The execution of the compulsory-education 
law made 172,811 sentences necessary. Of these, 106,957 imposed fines, 
14,487 imprisonment of one day or more, and 51,367 imprisonment of a 
few hours. The total amount of fines was (in 1889) 96,214 florins, or 
$34,925. Among every 100 children who according to the law should 
have attended school 10.9 escaped enrollment (literally ‘‘were entirely 
withheld from school”), and in the case of 5.13 fines or imprisonment 
wereimposed. While the fact that nearly 11 of every 100 children in Cis-

leithania escaped enrollment would seem to reflect upon one of the Ger- 
man-speaking nations, it must be remembered, however, that these de- 
ficiencies do not occur in the German, but chiefly in the Slavic crown 
lands, as is clearly seen from the following table:

Other items of interest.—In Austria (Cisleithania), 11,814 public schools 
- offered physical training in form of gymnastics; 10,503 public schools 
offered industrial training of some sort, chiefly to girls; 9,407 public 
schools had school gardens for the study of botany and horticulture; 
13,975 public schools had school libraries for pupils and teachers, while 
exclusively pedagogical libraries were maintained in 428 districts. The 
number of public kindergartens in Austria was 546, that of infant 
schools 486. Industrial continuation schools were maintained in 367 
districts and agricultural continuation schools in 455 districts. 
5.—SECONDARY EDUCATION. 
Austria had, during the year 1888-89, altogether 252 institutions that 
can be classed under the head of institutions for secondary education ; 173 
were “Gymnasia” and “Realgymnasia,” while 79 were ‘Realschulen.” 
The character of these schools is adequately expressed by saying 
that Gymnasia are colleges or high schools in whieh classical studies 
predominate, Realschulen such in which modern languages and sciences 
predominate, while Realgymnasia are hybrid forms that try to accom- 
modate students who cannot afford to follow either the classical or the 
modern course exclusively. Yet it is well understood in Europe that 
the Realgymnasia prepare students forthe universities, while Realschule 
graduates were until recently debarred from entering higher seats of 
learning. The official report gives the statistics of the secondary 
schools under two heads, (a) Gymnasia (including Realgymnasia), and 
(0) Realschulen. We shall do the same in order to see what proportion 
of students follow classical and what proportion modern courses. 
A.—If we group the Gymnasia and Realgymnasia according to the 
language of instruction, we find that in 98 schools (56.6 per cent) German 
is spoken; in 23 schools (13.5 per cent) Polish is spoken; in 3 schools 
(L. 7 per cent) Servian is spoken; in 39 schools (22.5 per cent) Bohemian 
is spoken; in 1 school (0.6 per cent) Ruthenian is spoken; in 3 schools 
(1.8 per cent) Italian is spoken, while in 6 schools, or 3.5 per cent, two 
languages are spoken.
-P-A-G-E-459
    EDUCATION IN AUSTRIA-HUNGARY IN 1889-90. 431 
These secondary classical schools are maintained by different author- 
ities as follows: 
The state maintains 126 (or 72.8 per cent), the crown lands or proy- 
inces 9 (or 5.2 per cent), a number of cities 19 (or 11 per cent), the church 
14 (or 8.1 per cent), and 5 (or 2.9 per cent) are private institutions or de- 
rive their maintenance from irreducible funds. 
The number of professors and assistant professors engaged in these 
classical schools during 1888-89 was 3,473, namely:

Sixty-four (er 1.8 per cent) spoke two languages. 
Students.—At the opening of the school year 1888-89 an increased 
numberof applicants for admission were examined, namely, 11,532, of 
whom 1,089, or 9.4 per cent, failed to pass. The entire enrollment dur- 
ing that year was 55,846 students, or 46,113 in the Gymnasia and 9,733 in 
the Realgymnasia. The number of students enrolled during the last 
three years, for which official reports are at hand, was 53,148 in 1886-87, 
52,665 in 1887-88, and 52,685 in 1888-89. 
The following table may be of interest to American high-school teach- 
ers who would like to compare the condition of gradation in their 
schools with those of foreign countries. ; 
In Austrian Gymnasia and Realgymnasia 20.5 per cent of the students 
sat in the lowest grade (11 years of age); 16.7 per cent in the second 
grade (12 years of age); 15.5 per cent in the third grade (13 years of 
age); 13.8 per cent in the fourth grade (14 years of age); 9.8 per cent 
in the fifth grade (15 years of age); 8.5 per cent in the sixth grade (167 
years of age); 7.7 per cent in the seventh grade (17 years of age); 7.5 
per cent in the eighth grade (18 years of age). The first four years 
(from 6 to 10 years of age) are spent in elementary and preparatory 
classes. 
_ The foregoing refers only to Gymnasia and Realgymnasia. We shall 
presently see what proportion of the total enrollment of students in the 
Realschulen go through the entire course. : 
   
-P-A-G-E-460
    432 EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
The following item confirms the often-heard statement that the Israel- 
ites send more children to secondary schools in proportion to their 
population than the Christians: Eighty-two per cent of the students in 
Gymnasia and Realgymnasia were Catholics, 1 per cent were Oriental 
Greeks, 2.6 per cent were Protestants, 14.2 per cent were Israelites, and 
other confessions were represented by 0.1 per cent. — 
That portion of the income of Gymnasia and Realgymnasia which was 
derived from tuition fees alone amounted to 956,344 florins, or $341,414, 
Nearly, one-half of all the students (47.4 per cent exactly) were freed 
from paying tuition fees. The number of students, who drew stipends 
was 2,764 (or 5.2 per cent of the whole number). The amount paid in 
stipends or scholarships was 340,973 florins, or $131,727.36, an average 
of $47.68. Of course, the amount paid per student in the different 
crownlands (or provinces) varies considerably, while in Lower Austria 
it amounted to about $60; in Silesia it was about $24. 
At the close of the year 1888-89, 4,109 senior students applied for ad- 
‘mission to the final examination, but only 3,944 were admitted, of which . 
only 3,536 or 89.8 per cent passed, 12.4 per cent of whom took the ex- 
amination twice in the same year. 
Of the 3,536 students who passed, 812 chose the study of theology, 
1,021 chose the study of law and national economy, 799 chose the study 
of medicine and pharmacy, 221 chose the study of philosophy and phi- 
lology, 74 chose technical studies, and 603 had not decided what study 
to take up. 
B.—The nuinber of Realschulen, or modern schools, in Austria during 
the school year 1888-89 was 79. Grouping them according to the 
language of instruction, we find that in 58 schools (73.4 per cent) German 
is spoken, in -b schools (6.3 per cent) Polish is spoken, in 3 schools (3.8 
per cent) Italian is spoken, in 12 schools (15.2 per cent) Bohemian is 
spoken, and in 1 school (1.3 per cent) Servian is spoken. 
The Realschulen, or modern secondary schools, are maintained by 
different authorities, as follows: The state maintains 48 (or 60.8 per 
cent), the Crown lands (or provinces) 16 (or 20.2 per cent), the cities 9 
(or 11.4 per cent), and 6 (or 7.6 per cent) are private institutions or 
derive their income from irreducible funds. 
The number of professors and assistant professors engaged in these 
modern schools during 1888-89 was 1,371, namely:

  The following ise: if compared witha similar one on page 431, where 
the ratio of students in each grade of the classical schools is given, 
may show that the gradation in the Realschulen is more irregular, and 
that fewer students are found in the higher grades than in Gymnasia, 
where 7.5 per cent of all the students are seniors. In Austrian Real- 
schulen 26.4 per cent of the students sat in the lowest grade (11 years 
of age); 22.4 per cent of the students sat in the second grade (12 years 
  of age); 17.8 per cent of the students sat in the third grade (13 years 
of age); 14.6 per cent of the students sat in the fourth grade (14 years 
of age); 7.9 per cent of the students sat in the fifth grade (15 years 
of age); 6 per cent of the students sat in the sixth grade (16 years 
of age); 4.9 per cent of the students sat in the seventh grade (17 years 
of age). 
If we further consider that the course of study is one year longer in 
Gymnasia than in these Realschulen, the difference in the falling off in 
the number of students of the two kinds of schools is very apparent. 
The religions are represented in Realschulen almost exactly as in 
Gymnasia; 80.7 per cent of the students in Realschulen were Catholics, 
0.4 per cent Oriental Grecks, 4.4 per cent were Protestants, 14.3 were 
Israelites; other confessions were represented by 0.2 per cent. 
The amount of tuition fees paid by the students of Realschulen was 
385,224 florins, or $137,525. While in the classical schools 5.2 per cent 
of the students drew stipends, only 2.3 per cent of the students of mod- 
ern schools enjoyed a like privilege. While in classical schools the 
amount of stipends was $131,727.36, it was only $14,728.75 in the med- 
ern schools, an average of $37.20, Eight hundred and fifty-nine senior 
students applied for admission to the final examination; of these 790, 
or 90.8 per cent, passed. 
6.—H1GHER EDUCATION. 
Higher education in Austria (Cisleithania) is represented by 8 uni- 
versities, 6 polytechnica, 1 agricultural college, 2 mining academies, 
ED 90-28   
 
-P-A-G-E-462
      434 . _ EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. - ‘ 
3 schools of fine arts, 43 theological seminaries, and 69 normal schools. 
The 8 universities of Austria are those of Vienna, Gratz, Innsbruck, 
Prague (German), Prague (Bohemian), Lemberg, Cracow, and Ozer- 
nowitz. The number of professors and assistant professors in all these 
8 institutions was 1,112, of which 71 belonged to the theological, 148 to 
the law faculty, 422 to the medical, and 471 to the philosophical fac- 
ulty. During 1889 the number of lectures given was 3,266; they were 
attended by 15,562 students during the winter semester, and by 
14,274 during the summer semester. Of these Vienna had 6,371 stu- 
dents in winter, 5,448 in summer; Gratz had 1,385 students in winter, 
1,311 in summer; Tieghratk had 890 students in winter, 873 in sum- 
mer; Pragtie (German) had 1,643 students in winter, 1,535 in summer; 
Poseus (Bohemian) had 2,537 students in winter, 2,500 in summer; 
Lemberg had 1,188 students in winter, 1,115 in summer; Cracow had 
1,277 students in winter, 1,231 in summer; Ozernowitz had 271 stu- 
dents in winter, 261 in summer. 
During the winter semester only the medical faculty had an increase 
of students, namely, 282, while the others had a decrease of 88 stu- 
dents in all. During the summer semester the theological and law 
faculties had an increase of 19 each, the medical one of 110,\and the 
philosophical a decrease of 41. 
The students came from all parts of the Austro-Hungarian Empire- 
but $4.1 per cent were born in Cisleithania, 9.1 per cent in Transleitha, 
nia, and 6.8 per cent in other countries. If the mother tongue of the © 
students be considered, we find that the different nationalities are 
represented as follows: Germans, 43.8 per cent; Bohemians, 22.1 per 
cent; Poles, 15.4 per cent; Ruthenians, 3.6 per cent; Southern Slavs, 
3.9-per cent; Italians, 3.2 per cent; Roumanians, 1.2 per cent; Magyars, 
3.9 percent; other nationalities, 2.9 per cent. 
The Ra ogs were represented by 72.8 per cent Catholics, 2.9 per 
cent Oriental Greeks, 3.9 per cent Protestants, 19.9 per cent Jews, 1 
per cent other confessions. The number of students who had the privi- 
lege of scholarships was 1,694 in winter and 1,741 in summer. The 
amount of stipends they drew was 547,773 florins, or $198,841.60 (a 
florin = 35.7 cents), for the entire year (average $116.66 for each stu- 
dent). 
At the close of the year 5. 5,435 students submitted to the final exami- 
nation, namely, 113 Students of theology, 1,821 of law, 2,524 of medicine, 
238 of philosophy, and 739 of shana In iiimolay 99.1 per cent 
passed, in law 85.5 per cent, in medicine 80.7 per cent, in philosophy 
95.3 per cent., in pharmacy '83. 2 percent. The on of doctor was 
conferred upon 1,226 candidates. The examinations for entering the 
service of the state were conducted in three sections: (1) legal and his- 
torical, for which 1,313 candidates applied and 1,065, or 81.1 per cent, 
passed; (2) judicial, for which 679 applied and 584, or 86 percent, 
passed; (3) science of government, for which 621 applied and 545, or 87.8

percent passed. The examination for diploma of teaching in secondary 
schools was passed by 207 out of 256 candidates, or 80.9 per cent. 
The six polytechnica of Cisleithania had in 1888-89 together 348 
professors and assistant professors. The number of “lectures and ex- 
ercises” was 590 in winter and 566 in summer. The attendance at 
the institutions has decreased during recent years, as is seen from the 
following figures:

  The chemical and ischntéal departs have euffered a pe de- 
crease than the general department, from which it may be inferred that 
the desire for general culture is greater than it was during the preced- 
ing decade, when civil engineers, chemists, machine builders, ete., were 
in special demand. 
All parts of the Austro-Hungarian Empire were represented among 
the students: Cisleithania with 83.6 per cent; Transleithania with 8.9 
per cent; 7.5 per cent were foreigners. These figures show very nearly 
the same proportion found in the number of students in the eight uni- 
yersities. But when comparing the numbers each nationality furnished, 
we notice some vital differences (compare p.-434): Germans, 52.1 per 
cent; Bohemians, 22.6 per Pes Poles, 12.5 per cent; Ruthenians, 0.6 
per doribs Southern Slavs, 3.5 percent; Italians, 2.5 per cent; Rouman- 
ians, 0.7 per cent; Magyars, 2.8 per oats other nationalities, 2.7 per cent. 
The religions were represented as iene 73.9 per cent were Catho- 
lies, 3.7 per cent Oriental Greeks, 5 per cent Protestants, 17 per cent 
Jews, 0.4 per cent other confessions. Twenty-six per cent of the stu- 
dents enjoyed whole and 7.5 per cent half scholarships. 
The agricultural college had 45 professors and assistants. This col- 
lege also experienced a decrease in attendance in late years, which is 
seen from the following figures:

A cause for this decrease is not stated in the official Austrian report. 
Cisleithania furnished 76 per cent, Transleithania 18.7 per cent, and 
foreign countries 5.3 per cent of the students. In regard to the mother 
tongue substantially the same ratios are found as in. the universities aoe

and polytechnica. The graduation examination in the polytechnica 
and the agricultural college was passed by 97.2 per cent of the candi-

The two mining academies had 27 professors. Like the aforemen-

  The 43 theological semina consisted of 39 Catholic and 4 institu- 
tions of other confessions. Altogether they had 244 professors and 
2,376 students. 
The cost of higher education is nowhere stated in the official reports 
of Austria, and special inquiries on the part of this Bureau have remained 
unanswered, hence it is impossible to make a definite statement such as 
is made for other countries. All that can be said definitely is that in 
Austria (Cisleithania) the state spent, through the medium of the min- 
ister of education, $8,307,774.49 in the year 1891 for all kinds of educa- 
tional institutions. What proportion of this sum total is applied to 
higher, to secondary, and to elementary education cannot be stated. 
In 1889 Austria had 69 normal schools, 42 for men and 27 for women, 
The language of instruction was German in 39, Bohemian in 12, Polish 
in 6, Italian in 2, Servian in 2 institutions, and in 8 of them several lan- 
guages were used. 
These 69 normal schools had 972 teachers and 9,415 students. There 
is, however, a distinction to be made between normal schools for ele- 
mentary teachers and those for industrial teachers and kindergartens, 
which last two kinds of schools were attended by 502 students, while 
8,913 students attended normal schools for elementary instruction. In 
Austria, as well as in Germany and Switzerland, the teachers of see- 
ondary schools are, as a rule, graduates of the philosophical faculty of 
universities. According to their nationalities the students of normal 
schools in Austria are to be classified as follows:

  Thirty-two per cent of the men and 23 per cent of the women were 
free from paying tuition fees, being supported by scholarships. Of 
1,203 senior male students who submitted to the final examination, only 
1,007 (or 83.6 per cent) passed; of 502.senior female students, 476 (or 
94.8 per cent) passed. This, however, does not state the number of 
teachers who were qualified, since 1,076 candidates (both men and 
women) obtained a teacher’s diploma by submitting to the same exami- 
nation without having attended a normal school. Of this number, 909 
were qualified for conducting kindergartens or teaching female handi- 
work (so-called industrial teachers). Hence the real number of new 
elementary teachers throughout Austria (Cisleithania) in 1889 was 1,143, 
which would seem a small number ifcompared with the sum total of — 
elementary teachers employed, 60,126; of which 6,930 were women who 
taught female handiwork. 
7.—SPECIAL SCHOOLS. 
Austria had, in 1889, 70 commercial schools, with 575 teachers and 
10,003 students, of whom 9,387 remained on the roll at the close of the 
year. Lower Austria had 18 of such schools, Upper Austria 2, Salz- 
burg, 1, Styria 4, Carinthia 2, Coastland 2, Tyrol 5, Bohemia 26, Moravia 
4, Silesia 2, Galicia 3, and Bukowina 1. 
Of 100 students in these commercial schools, 72.5 per cent were Ger- 
mans, 16.6 per cent Bohemians, 2.1 per cent Poles, 0.1 per cent Ruthe- 
nians, 2 per cent Southern Slavs, 2.4 per cent Italians, 0.3 per cent 
Roumanians, 3.1 per cent Hungarians, 0.9 per cent of other or unknown 
nationality. 
Of 100 students, 72 per cent were Catholics, 0.8 per cent Oriental 
Greeks, 3.6 per cent Protestants, 23.5 per cent Israelites. 
Austria had, in 1889, 619 industrial schools, which, according to their 
object in view, may be grouped as follows: 
(A) Twenty-one technical schools for staple trades. 
(B) One hundred and eighteen technical schools for separate branches. 
(C) Six general industrial schools for artisans. 
(D) Four hundred and seventy-four general: industrial continuation

The German and Bohemian parts of Cisleithania had the most of 
these schools, as is seen from the following table: 
  
  
   Lower Austria.. Upper Austria = Tyrol .... Bohemia 
Carniola . 
          
              
     The number of teachers in these 619 industrial schools during the 
year 1888-89 was 3,754, and the number of students 64,439; this is an 
increase of 304 teachers and 5,498 students over the previous year. 
Of every 100 students 49.1 were Germans, 39 Bohemians, 4.3 Poles, 
0.3 Ruthenians, 3.1 Southern Slavs, 2.8 Italians, 0.1 Roumanians, 0.9 
Hungarians, 0.4 other or unknown nationality.

1.—INTRODUCTION. 
Most of what has been said concerning the historical development of 
the schools in Austria (Cisleithania) [see p. 417] is applicable also to 
Hungary (Transleithania), since the latter country gained autonomy 
only after the war with Prussia in 1866, and the strictly Hungarian 
school management dates from 1869. The last annual report of the - 
minister of public instruction is the nineteenth since the new era, and 
hence offers most interesting comparisons covering a period of twenty 
years. At present the elementary schools in Hungary are governed 
by the laws passed by parliament in 1876 and 1879, These laws are 
referred to in the following paragraphs where it seemed necessary to 
point out differences between Austria and Hungary. 
  2. ELEM ‘ARY EDUCATION. 
Area and population of Hungary.—According to the census of 1880, 
Hungary has an area of 280,399 square kilometers and 13,749,603 in- 
habitants (exclusive of non-autonomous countries belonging to the. 
Austro-Hungarian Empire, but not to the Kingdom of Hungary, such 
as Bosnia, etc.).

This is an increase of 8.04 per cent in twenty years. In 1869 Hun- 
gary had 16.85 per cent, in 1889 it had 17.2 per cent of children of school 
age (6 to 15 years) in the entire population.

of school age enrolled in school; 453,014 children escaped enrollment.

Absence from school.—During 1889 the aggregate number of days’ 
absence caused by 4,286,780 pupils was 10,488,579, whichis an average 
of 8 days per child. Thirty-five per cent of the enrolled children were 
not absent at all. Ninety-five per cent of the cases of absence were 
considered excusable, while 5 per cent were submitted to the deci- 
sion of the authorities, who imposed fines when no valid excuse could 
be furnished. The minister states that though the fines imposed 
amounted to $185,756, only $14,510 were actually paid, from which fact 
he infers that the communal authorities are very lax in the enforce- 
ment of the compulsory-attendance law.

Of the total sum expended for elementary schools in 1869, 95.93 per 
cent (or $1,287,383) were applied to pay salaries, 4.07 per cent (or 
$54,982) for buildings and contingent expenses. This ratio was changed 
very essentially in 1889, when it was 74.89 per cent ($4,041,714) for sal- 
aries and 25.11 per cent ($1,355,053) for buildings, etc. 
The following averages are valuable, since they afford an opportunity 
for comparison with other countries. The burden of establishing and

47 (65.3 per cent) in 1889, In 1869 the normal schools were attended 
by 1,386 young men and only 140 young women; in 1889 the number of 
young men was 2,666 and that of the young women 1,118, a total of 
3,781 students in 1889. The normal schools had 271 professors and

enditures for the maintenance of infant schools amounted to 
$161,180 in 1889, or $2.72 per capita, These institutions had an irre- 
ducible fund of $619,578. The teachers for these infant schools are 
prepared by three kindergarten seminaries of the Frébel Society, which 
had, in 1889, 25 teachers and 204 graduates, of whom 109 received a 
state diploma. The expenditures for these seminaries amounted to 
$7,351, 
Pensions and aid to widows and orphans.—During the year 1889 
15,549 (or 63 per cent) of all the elementary teachers in Hungary con- 
tributed to the pension fund (in 1875 only 8,537). The fund amounted 
to $2,588,726 in 1889, and the payments made to beneficiaries amounted 
to $95,119, or 3.67 per cent of the fund. 
Beneficiaries in 1889.—Pensioned teachers, 829; subventions — to 
widows, 3,212; policies paid at death, 30; a total of 4,000 cases. 
Schoolhouses and apparatus.—The number of schoolhouses for ele- 
mentary schools built for the purpose was'15,291 (or 91 per cent); 1,488 
Schools (or 9 per cent) were kept in rented quarters. The number of 
- elass rooms was 24,655, or 272 more than during the previous year. In 
order to accommodate all the pupils enrolled so as to prevent over- 
crowded schools about 5,000 rooms are needed. 
The minister of public education also offers in the following statement 
information such as would be welcome in any school report. An in- 
ventory of school apparatus held at the close of 1888-89 showed that 
there were 30,425 large blackboards in 24,655 rooms; 5,060 collections 
for object-teaching in 16,455 elementary schools; 18,794 sets of charts 
for reading and writing in 16,455 elementary schools; 14,972 collec- 
tions for teaching arithmetic objectively in 16,455 elementary schools; 
16,454 copies of wall maps of Hungary, 6,719 copies of wall maps of 
Austria, 11,908 copies of wall maps of Europe, and 6,088 copies of wall 
maps of the globe in 16,702 elementary schools; 12,702 globes and as- 
tronomical apparatus, 5,997 collections of physical apparatus, and 
11,282 collections of natural history in 16,702 elementary schools; 6,340 
models for drawing and 2,874 sets of apparatus for gymnasties in 
15,363 elementary schools; 7,033 educational and juvenile libraries, and 
1,458 popular libraries. 
The number of school gardens was 8,989 in 1889, and that of tree 
nurseries belonging to elementary schools was 10,830 in the same year. 
Of every 1,000 schools, 538.2 had a school garden and 648.4 a tree 
nursery. 
_ The number of gymnastic halls connected with elementary schools 
was 2,874; that of grounds -for open-air gymnastics was 7,855. 
During the year 1888-89 76 per cent of all the elementary teachers, 
18,602 in number, had their dwellings in- the schoolhouses, while 6,043 
(or 24 per cent) received a suitable compensation for paying rent.

Advanced (or superior) elementary schools.—This group of schools con- 
sists of institutions such as are called middle schools in Prussia, écoles 
primaires supérieures in France, and with us public high schools, as 
found in small country towns. They are advanced grades of grammar 
schools, but separate for boys and girls.. Their course of study is one 
of three years for boys and two years for girls. 
In 1889 there were 68 of such adyanced elementary schools, with 301 
teachers and 2,562 pupils (689 boys and 1,873 girls). The expenditures 
amounted to $69,984 in 1889, of which sum the state defrayed 40.74 per 
cent, The per capita was $27.11. 
Citizens’ schools, or public advanced schools for boys and girls— While 
the group of schools previously mentioned is decreasing in number, this 
one is increasing steadily. Their number in 1889 shows an increase of 
5. Seventy-seven of these middle schools (that is the generic term for 
this class of schools in central Europe; middle, because between ele- 
mentary and secondary) were boys’ and girls’ schools. 
In 1889 there were 162 of such schools, with 1,151 teachers and 18,484 
pupils (9,699 boys and 8,785 girls). Nothing will more clearly state ~ 
the difference of these citizens’ or middle schools from purely elemen- 
tary schools, than the fact that they had 782 class rooms, 146 offices or 
teachers’ rooms, 117 recitation rooms, 44 library rooms, 30 laboratories, 
and 45 gymnasiums. The expenditures amounted to $435,958 in 1889, 
of which sum the state defrayed 39.60 per cent. The per capita was 
$23.58. 
Girls’ higher schools.—These schools, of which Hungary had 17in 1889, 
_ are also classed among the middle schools. They had 224 teachers and 
2,124 pupils. The expenditure amounted to $102,718, of which sum 
the state defrayed 54.80 per cent. The per capita was $48.36, 
4.—NORMAL SCHOOLS. 
Hungary had, in 1889, 72 normal schools for elementary teachers. It 
is the intention of the law that these schools should prepare teachers 
by means of purely professional training, but the minister states that 
many of them are still burdened with academic studies from want of 
preparation on the part of the candidates for admission. A large num- 
ber of the denominational normal schools are merely supplements of 
schools designed for other purposes, and 36 per cent of the denomina- 
~ tional normal schools have not even a practice school. 
Hungary had, in 1889, 25 state, 24 Roman Catholic, 4 Greek Catholic, 
4 Greek Oriental, 4 Reformed Evangelical, 10 Protestant (of the Augs- 
burg confession), and 1 Jewish, a total of 72 normal schools. Sixty- 
nine of these prepared teachers for lower elementary schools, and three 
teachers for advanced elementary schools. 
The number of students in these 72 schools was 4,116 (2,926 young 
men, and 1,190 young ladies), an increase of 241 over the previous year.

Ten per cent of the students withdrew during the year for various 
reasons. All these schools haye a four years’ course. Comparing the 
following columns we seo that the number of withdrawals during the 
year is greater among the men than among the women.

          894 3384 First year Second ye: 768 313 
Third yea 701 313 
Fourth ye: 303 153 
Hence, of 894 men entering the first year’s course, only 303 com- 
pleted the course (only 34 per cent); out of 334 women 158 completed 
the course (47 per cent). 
During 1889 the number of teachers (professors and assistants in 
normal schools) was 710, an increase of 25 over the previous year. 
The expenditures for 1889 were $360,636, of which the state bore 
61.9 per cent; the church funds yielded 12.20 per cent; the private 
funds of endowed institutions 12.6 per cent; tuition fees 13.3 per cent. 
The following statement is interesting, inasmuch as it shows the dif- 
ferent appreciation state and church entertain for professional training 
of teachers.

5.— INFANT, SCHOOLS. 
During the year 1889, 474 of 12,685 communities in Hungary had in- 
fant schools and Kindergiirten, the entire number of which was 644. 
Forty-two of these were maintained from endowment funds, 65 by the 
State, 163 by communities, 184 by societies, and 87 by private persons. 
These 644 infant schools had 59,066 pupils of prescholastic age, com- 
- monly between 3 and 6 years. They were kept by 722 kindergardners 
and 504 assistants, called nurses. Five hundred and four had diplo- 
mas; 268 had not. Forty-seven were men, 725 were women; 623 were 
secular, 149 clerical persons (nuns). 
The 644 institutions had 471 play and gymnastic grounds, 582 play 
and work rooms, 252 gardens, and 252 common court yards for play. 
In 591 of these institutions the ruling language was Hungarian; in 13
-P-A-G-E-475
  “EDUCATION IN AUSTRIA-HUNGARY IN 1889-90. 447 
it was German; in 32 both Hungarian and German were used. The 
cost of maintenance for 1838-89 amounted to $161,170. 
The Society for the Promotion of Infant Schools and Central Frébel 
Women’s Society maintained as heretofore normal schools for the prep- 
aration of kindergartners. A similar institution is found in the con- 
vent at Koloesa. The total number of students was 212, of whom 204 
completed the course. The number of teachers was 25, and the ex- 
penditures for maintaining these institutions amounted to $7,351. 
It is the intention of the minister of public instruction to aid all per- 
sons and societies who are making efforts in behalf of infant schools 
and Kindergirten and to subsidize such institutions, so that in a few 
"years all densely populated centers of the kingdom will have at least 
one of these institutions. 
6.—SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 
It is a noticeable feature of the Hungarian school system that it ree- 
ognizes only two kinds of secondary schools: the “Gymnasium” and 
the “Realschule” (the classical and the modern school). While in — 
-Germany several other kinds, the “ Realgymnasium,” “héhere Biirger- 
schule,” “‘héhere Schule ohne Latein,” etc., make it difficult to classify 
the statistical data of secondary education, Hungary offers ‘no diffi- 
culty in this respect. The one momentous question that occupied the 
management of these schools in 1888-89 was the new law of June 24, 
1888, which made Greek an optional study. The minister reports that 
it was not the intention of the law to exclude Greek, but to facilitate 
the selection of a profession. Twenty-six per cent of pupils in grade V 
and 36 per cent in grade VI availed themselves of the permission 
granted by the law and chose other studies, chiefly Hungarian litexa- 
ture and drawing. 
The following statistics are culled from the minister’s annual report 
for 1888-89:

grades, and 5 have 4 grades. Four secondary schools have an irregu- 
lar organization. The secondary schools of Hungary had a total of 
43,670 students in 1888-89, 36,367 of whom attended the classical and 
7,303 the modern schools, which expressed in ratios is 83.3 per cent in 
gymnasia and 16.7 percent in Realschulen; but, while the increase of 
attendance of the former over the previous year was 1.1 per cent, that 
of the latter was 3.3 per cent. Hungary has 318 students in secondary 
schools in every 100,000 inhabitants, Austria 334, Prussia 467,

The fact that in gymnasia about 25 per cent of the students lsanionee 
the lowest class reach the highest, while in Realschulen only about 10 
per cent, is remarkable, and proves that in Hungary classical edu- 
cation is firmly rooted, while so-called modern. education is discounted. 
The cause is to be found in the fact that all who aim at entering the 
university and the professions are obliged to pass through a gymnasium, 
Though the sum total of enrolled secondary students was 43,670, the 
number of those who attended the whole year was only 40,596. 
« The last number is accounted for in the minister’s report when he 
states the fees paid for tuition—32,017 paid the fees in full, 2,023 only 
half the fees, 6,566 paid no fee. The amount paid per student is not 
mentioned,

Examination for graduation and admission to a university or poly-. 
technicum: 2,308 students applied for admission to the final examina-- 
tion; of these 2,083 passed the written and were admitted to the oral 
examination. A review examination raised the number of those ad- 
mitted to oral examination to 2,219, but only 1,914 passed both exam- 
inations. Seventeen and six tenths per cent of the senior students in 
Gymnasia failed, 12.4 per cent of the senior students in Realschulen 
failed. 
Professors in secondary schools—The number of regular teachers 
(professors) in Gymnasia in 1889 was 1,323, in Realschulen, 334; assist- 
ants in Gymnasia, 277; in Realschulen, 37; teachers of religion in Gym- 
nasia, 507; in Realschulen, 130; teachers of Gymnastics and those who 
gave only occasional lessons in Gymnasia, 190; in Realschulen, 41; 
drawing and other special teachers in Gymnasia, 147; in Realschulen, 
45; a total of 3,031 regular, assistant, and special teachers. Of the 
regular professors 1,026 have a state diploma, 120 a diploma granted 
by church authorities, 16 foreign diplomas, 381 were recognized by law 
- though having no diploma, 14 were engaged in teaching though haying 
neither a diploma nor authoritative permit. Of the assistants 143 had 
a diploma, 171 had not. Of the teachers of gymnastics 167 had a 
diploma, 64 had not. Of the special teachers 121 had a diploma, 72 
had not. 
Other items of interest—The 180 secondary schools had, in 1889, 1,110 
class rooms, 184 museums for natural history, 191 museums for physics, 
82 chemical laboratories, 129 drawing halls, 108 winter gymnastic 
halls, 260 library rooms, 140 conference rooms, 113 offices, 124 summer 
gymnastic courts, 112 yards for recreation, 188 rooms for day boarders, 
370 dormitories, and 862 other localities. :

Income and expenditures for secondary schools.\—The value of build: 
‘ings for secondary school purposes in Hungary in 1890 was 24,870,000 
florins, or $8,878,590. The total income of secondary schools was 
$1,328,661. To this sum the state contributed $322,674. The proceeds 
from irreducible funds amounted to $203,597; from church funds, 
$154,509; from tuition fees, $255,552; other income (probably from local 
taxes), $392,429, Hence the-state contributed 24 per cent for the 
maintenance of secondary schools. See the following comparison with

  7.— HIGHER EDUCATION. 
Hungary has 3 universities, in Buda-Pesth, Klausenburg, and Agram; 
1 polytechnicum in Buda-Pesth, 53 theological seminaries, and 11 law 
schools. The number of professors and assistant professors in 1891 
was 322 in the universities, 10 in the polytechnicum, 343 in the theo- 
logical seminaries, and 122 in the law school. The number of students 
during the same year was 4,098 in the universities, 616 in the poly- 
technicum, 1,855 in the theological seminaries, and 792 in the law 
schools. The amount expended for the two universities and one poly- 
technicum in 1889 was. 1,020,034 florins, or $364,152. Of this sum the 
state’s contribution is known only for the universities, 67 per cent. 
The expenditures for theological seminaries and law schools are not 
stated in the annual report of the minister. These institutions are 
not under his immediate jurisdiction, the state not subsidizing them. 
'8:—SPRCIAL SCHOOLS, 
Hungary has quite an array of special schools. In 1889 it had 278 
courses for industrial students or trade schools with 46,288 students 
and 1,445 teachers. The expenditures for these courses amounted to 
: $127,875. It had 83 workshops for home industry with 5,466 appren- 
tices and 186 instructors. ‘The expenditures for these workshops 
amounted to $32,952, Hungary had also 1 school of pottery with 
12 students and 2 teachers. Oost of maintenance, $919. It had 
lindustrial art school with 155 students and 10 professors. Cost of 
maintenance not stated, except the amount paid for scholarships, 
which was $1,430. Connected with this institution is the technolog- 
ical and industrial museum, in which lectures are given to 455 students 
on technical subjects. There were also 75 elementary and 22 second- 
ary commercial schools. The former had 4,046 students and 267 teach- 
ers, the latter 1,870 students and 282 teachers. The cost of mainte- 
nance for both kinds of schools amounted to $120,419. The schools for 
  
11 florin equals 85.7 cents,

midwifery had 472 students. A normal school for teachers of drawing 
-had 90 students; a school of fine arts had 110 students and 15 profes- 
sors; a school for music and the drama with 136 students and 26 teach- 
ers; besides these there were other special and philanthropic institu- 
tions and asylums for defective classes with 3,210 pupils and 195 teach- » 
ers and nurses. 
The annual state appropriations for educational purposes for 1891-92 
in Hungary amount to $3,643,762; in Austria, $8,307,774; in Prussia, 
for the same year, $21,581,319.

  CHAPTER XII. 
BRIEF STATEMENT OF THE SCHOOL SYSTEM OF PRUSSIA: 
INTRODUCTION. 
The German Empire, being a federation of states (kingdoms, duchies, 
principalities and free cities), does not maintain a national school sys- 
‘tem, but since the army and navy are imperial, the military and naval 
academies are under the immediate care of the Imperial Government. 
Each state maintains its own school system; hence an outline of any of 
the systems of Prussia, Saxony, Bavaria, or Wiirtemberg may serve 
as a representative German system; the differences are slight and 
chiefly refer to supervision and courses of study. 
L.—THE ScHOOLS OF PRUSSIA. 
Tistablishment and maintenance.—The public schools are established 
and maintained partly by the state, partly by the communities. The 
state gives precedence to the communities in establishing elementary — 
schools, called Volksschulen (people’s schools), and takes the initiative 
only in eases of inability on the part of the communities. The state’s 
proportion of the annual expenditure for elementary school purposes 
is about 19 per cent of the whole. To a great extent this policy is ad- 
hered to also with reference to so-called modern secondary schools, such 
as scientific, technical, and industrial schools, but the state’s propor- 
tion of the cost is greater there than in the lower schools; it is 37. per 
cent; while with regard to classical secondary schools the propor- 
tion is 69 per cent. In regard to higher education, such as is offered 
in universities and art academies, the state takes the initiative and as- 
sumes all expenses. Many schools, both elementary and secondary, © 
are partially supported by the proceeds of the permanent school funds 
that have their origin in endowments, legacies, sequestration of church” 
  property, and other sources. The annual proceeds from these funds — 
amount to 6 per cent of the entire expenditures for elementary school 
purposes, * c

There are. no-parochial schools in Prussia, that is, schools owned and 
managed by religious bodies, but all elementary schools are exclusively 
Protestant, Catholic, or Jewish schools. Schools in which all the con- 
fessions are represented (so called “Simultanschulen”) are compara- 
tively rare, and their establishment is discouraged by the Government. 
Private efforts in founding and supporting a variety of educational in- 
stitutions, differing in scope, character, and aims, are frequent and 
much encouraged by the authorities, owing to the pzevailing class dis- 
- tinetions in the society of the Old World. Reform ideas are usually 
propagated in private institutions until the Government becomes con- 
vineed of their strength and popularity, and adopts them; in that case 
it begins by subsidizing and subsequently ends by maintaining the 
schools that represent these ideas.

A comparison of the numbers in column “Sex” reveals the interesting 
fact that girls are in the minority in secondary and superior institu- 
tions, and also in the preparatory classes that lead up to secondary 
schools. The proportion of boys to girls in secondary schools is more. 
than 2 to1; in normal schools it is as 10 to 1; in universities and 
polytechnica only male students are admitted.

  THE SCHOOL SYSTEM OF PRUSSIA. A57- s 
Bupenditures for public-school purposes in 1888.—The official report 
for 1887 calculates the expenditures for 1888 to be as follows: 
Per capita    
      
      
   Schools. napa noes

1.86 
  
This sum total is obtained from various sources that may be grouped 
under three heads: (a) Funds, that is, irreducible funds, of which only 
the annual proceeds may be used; (b) State taxes; (c) local taxes and 
tuition fees. In order to avoid repetition the proportions are stated be- 
low in percentages:

Hence it is obvious that the communities provide chiefly for ele- 
mentary education, while the state provides chiefly for secondary, su- 
perior, and special education. In 1886 the expenses for elementary 
schools alone were $29,153,912, of which $18,811,286 were used for sal- 
aries and $10,442,626 for buildings and incidental expenses; or, in per- 
centages, 64.5 per cent for salaries, 35.5 per cent for buildings and in- 
cidentals. 
Administration and supervision.—The minister of ecclesiastical, edu- 
cational, and medical affairs, amember of the King’s cabinet, has the 
general direction and supervision of all educational institutions of the 
Kingdom. The Kingdom is divided into twelve provinces, with from 
1,000,000 to 4,000,000 inhabitants each. At the head of the adminis- 
trative affairs of each province stands.a president, who has a cabinet 
of councilors for the different branches of administration, such as land 
office, judicial office, school office, etc. The heads of these school de- 
partments, the provincial school councilors, are the organs of inter- 
communication between the minister and lower authorities. Each 
province is divided into four or five subdivisions called governmental 
districts (counties of enormous size, sometimes having nearly a million 
of inhabitants). These districts (or counties) have a complete corps of 
administrative officers with a district president at their head. Among 
these officers are school councilors, who act as examiners and super- 
visors for entire districts. Each district is divided into reise (circuits), 
               
-P-A-G-E-486
    \     458 EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
corresponding somewhat in size and population to our townships. There 
‘are city circuits and country circuits. At the headof the city government 
stands the burgomaster, or mayor, elected by the city council or board 
of aldermen, but confirmed or rejected by the Royal Government. At 
the head of the rural circuit stands the Landrath (country councilor). 
In cities a committee of three or five members of the city council act as 
local school board; in villages and country townships three or five 
leading citizens are appointed to act as a school board. Thus it is seen 
that from the rura] school district up to the central Royal Government 
there is an ascending scale of administrative and directive authorities. 
The secondary schools that are not exclusively Government schools 
have each a board of trustees of their own, called curatorium, selected 
jointly by the city council, the Government, and interested parties, 
such as representatives of trust funds and legacies. The ‘affairs of 
royal secondary schools are managed by the school councilors directly. . 
Boards, both of lower and secondary schools, have practically the same 
authority that our city school boards commonly have, except in ques- 
tions pertaining to cowrses of study (which are prescribed in general 
outlines by the central government and interpreted by the school coun- 
cilors), selection of teachers (which is subject to confirmation or rejec- 
‘tion by the Government), and other points. Cases of discipline, for 
instance, over which our boards have final jurisdiction, may be carried 
to the higher authority of provincial councilors and to the minister, 
before any court will entertain their consideration. } 
The elementary or people’s schools of Prussia have, and apparently 
need, little direct supervision, because the teachers in Prussia must 
have acquired professional training before their application is enter- 
tained or their appointment confirmed by the authorities. Still there 
is a general supervision exercised by the state. The provincial and 
district councilors, mentioned above, supervise indirectly. by examin- 
ing the teachers at their graduation from the normal schools, and by 
making occasional visits in schools. They are generally considered 
the courts of appeal in difficulties between teachers and local scheol 
boards. Local supervision is exercised by the mayor and clergyman. 
In communities where a school board exists, that board either superin- 
tends the schools through its members or employs professional inspect- 
ors. The latter’s duties are, to all intents and purposes, similar to 
those of our city school superintendents. Clergymen have been not 
infrequently employed as school inspectors during the last twenty years, 
but professional supervision is now considered preferable except for 
religious instruction. Many of the inspectors in Prussia are heads 
of normal schools, high schools, ete., and devote only a part of their 
time to supervision, The secondary schools are supervised by the 
provincial councilors. The election of their principals is subject to the 
confirmation of the provincial authorities. Supervisors for rural 
schools are employed frequently but not systematically, owing to the — 
 
-P-A-G-E-487
    
THE SCHOOL SYSTEM OF PRUSSIA. 459 
fact that the school system in Prussia is not. administered according _ 
to an organic law, but is subject to the orders and regulations of the 
cabinet minister. Each supervisor or inspector reports to his higher 
officer; these reports are not printed, but may be examined in the in- 
spector’s office. 
Teachers.—The professional preparation of teachers in Prussia is the — 
source of strength of the people’s schools. The earliest attempts on 
the part of the state at improving the schools were directed at estab- 
lishing normal schools, ‘ 
In 1889 Prussia had 116 normal schools—106 for men, 10 for women. 
The cost for maintaining these schools is borne by the state exclusively. 
It amounts to $150 per student per annum. : 
The course of study in normal schools in Prussia is one of three or 
four years. It embraces a thorough review of the common. branches, 
_ the high-school branches, theoretical and practical instruction in instru- 
mental music, drawing, gymnastics, and pedagogy (history of education, 
psychology, theory and practice of teaching). No foreign languages 
are taught in Prussian normal schools. ; 
Previous to entering a normal school many students pass a year or 
two in a preparatory school, but this is not obligatory. They may ac- 
quire their previous education anywhere. The state being at times 
unable to secure a sufficient number of students, pays a premium to 
well-reputed teachers, who prepare boys for the normal schools There — 
is a rigid examination for admission. Atthe close of the course a still 
more rigid examination precedes graduation. Rarely does a student 
fail to graduate, the Government having taken the responsibility for 
his professional education. But the authorities grade the diplomas I, 
Ib, Il, I1b, TIT, and IV. A teacher whose diploma numbers IV is not 
likely ever to obtain a lucrative position. This marking or grading the 
diplomas is analogous to diplomas issued in this country for one, two, 
three, or more years. No teacher can be permanently employed unless 
he has a normal-school diploma. Assistants are at times, when candi- 
dates are scarce, employed without having this diploma, but in that 
ease they must pass an assistant’s examination. 
The appointment of teachers is not regulated by a general law. The 
power of electing the teachers is vested in communal school authori- 
ties where such authorities exist. In country places the circuit (Kreis) 
authorities perform these functions, but, whether elected by city authori- 
ties or appointed by circuit inspectors or chosen by patrons, the selection 
is subject to the confirmation of the representative of the Government, _ 
be that representative of the circuit, district, provincial, or state Goy- 
ernment, as the case may be. 
In the main the principle is adhered to that the.local authorities 
choose the teachers and the Government confirms or rejects the appoint- 
ment. The legal and social position of the teacher is well defined in 
Prussia. He is an officer of the state and receives a pension after hav-

   EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
d ing taught a certain number of years, and his widow and orphans are 
= pntisled to support, though this support rarely amounts to more than 
one-half of the teacher’s salary. By means of coéperation the teachers 
of every German state have founded insurance, codperative, discount, 
and other societies for mutual aid, societies which in a measure supple- 
ment the work of the state. ‘ 
The last official school report of Prussia, that aor 1887, states the 
~ average salary of the teachers in the people’s or elementary schools to 
have been as follows: _ t 
Average in the Kingdom: Marks. ; 
1, 067 = $266 
1,102= 275 
; - 1,279 = 319 
- 1414 853 
  This shows a decrease in eight years of $18 in the Kingdom and of 
$33 in the cities. These salaries are comparatively smaller than in 
America, but the teachers in Prussia have no rent to pay, living in 
dwellings attached to the schoolhouses. Calculating the rent at 20 
per,cent, the average salary may be considered to be $340. The sal- 
_avies of rectors (principals) of large “ biirger” schools in cities— 
superior, elementary or middle schools are higher. The teachers and 
his professors of middle and high schools—are not included in the averages 
mentioned above; their salaries range much higher than the foregoing 
ee averages. : 
sé Course of study.—The course of study in elementary schools embraces 
religion, reading, writing, arithmetic, geography, singing, drawing, 
natural history, natural science, and history of man. No text-books are 
used for natural history, natural science, or history of man; this in- 
struction is oral. In arithmetic, Prussian schools are less proficient 
than the American, but the advancement made in nearly all the studies 
is faster than in America. This fact is easily accounted for by (a) the 
difficult spelling of the English language; (b) the efforts in learning and 
applying the tables of our arbitrary measures and weights; (c) the 
greater length of school sessions and terms in Prussia, and (d) the want 
of a profession of teaching in this country, and consequent lack of proper 
teaching. These are the most important causes. 
Germany is very rich in text-books. In no country is a greater 
variety published. This secures great variety in teaching, and a very 
~ beneficial and healthy competition among schools, and especially teach- 
: ers. Of course the children of a school and of a community are re- 
Bee quired to use the same books. 
: Every teacher has the greatest possible liberty in the selection of 
= the methods of teaching. No inspector (or superintendent) prescribes 
be methods; all he does is to suggest improvements here and there. But

ean safely leave teachers to their own devices, trusting in their profes- 
sional spirit and ambition. - 
Branches of study.—Religion: This instruction is nonsectarian in 
character, but Protestants, Catholics, and Israelites are as much as 
possible grouped in separate schools. Where they attend mixed 
schools they are separated only during the lessons in religion. Biblical 
history, catechism with bible verses, memorizing of hymns, essential 
points of religious ethics, and the creed, is what the public schools are 
required to teach. Language and reading: Familiarity with the mother 
tongue and a limited knowledge of German literature is, broadly speak- 
ing, the sum total of attainable results. Penmanship and drawing: As 
a rule the penmanship of the pupils is commendable. In drawing par- 
ticularly rapid progress has been made of late. The exercises chiefly 
consist of ornamental drawing and form studies. In the higher grades 
drawing of solids and modeling is practiced. Arithmetic: This study. 
is less extended than in American schools, chiefly mental work (Kopf- 
rechnen) being done, and little figuring on slates and paper. Singing: 
Vocal music is practiced quite early and continued through the entire 
course. Three and four part music is not infrequently found in simple 
village schools. Geography: This study is pursued without-a text- ~ 
book, unless a small atlas may be termed a text-book. This study 
stands in close relation to history, which study is begun quite early 
with home stories and references to the child’s home and environments. 
All historical knowledge is offered in biographies. Natural history: 
In form of object lessons natural history is taught without a text-book. 
The upper grades take up ‘the study of physics, and not infrequently 
also chemistry. These studies are very elementary, but are pursued 
with the aid of simple and sometimes home-made apparatus. Gym- 
-. nastics: Physical exercises are prescribed in the course, and no school 
is without suitable apparatus for regular exercise. Manual training 
for boys is not prescribed officially, but private efforts in this direction 
are greatly encouraged and even subsidized by the Government. In- 
dustrial education for girls consists in knitting, crocheting, embroider- 
ing, sewing, darning, cutting, fitting, and patching, and is found in 
every school. 
What branches are taught in secondary schools, and in what years of 
the course, can best be seen from the four graphic charts published in 
the Report of 1888-89.

Diagram III. As regards arithmetic and mathematics, p. 175. 
Diagram IV. As regards natural sciences, p. 176. 
The language used in instruction in Prussian schools is German, ex- 
cept in the border districts where Polish, Danish, Lithuanian, and French 
are permitted besides German. The Government, however, makes efforts 
to suppress all foreign languages.

‘ School management.—There is no undue prominence given to the mem- 
- ory in the schools of Prussia. Very little is learned by heart or by rote. 
The first object of the teacher is to make his pupils observe things, 
comprehend facts, and to lead them from stage to stage, so as to keep 
up an eager interest. 
A daily programme is made by the principals of elementary schools 
_ and strictly adhered to. These programmes differ from those in use in 
American city schools only in this respect: lessons and recitations 
usually last from 40 to 50 minutes. This is not considered too long, 
because the teaching is almost always conducted according to the 
Socratic method, and consists of questions and answers. In the Prus- 
_ sian public elementary schools one teacher of a year’s course teaches 
all the branches prescribed. In the secondary schools most teachers 
are specialists, teaching either languages, natural sciences, or accom- 
plishments, such as drawing and music. 
Examinations are rare in elementary schools and do not exceed three 
per annum. Rarely are pupils promoted according to the results of 
examination, The teacher’s estimate is all-sufficient. Most examina- 
tions for promotion are oral, and are as a whole conducted in the pres- 
ence of the parents and friends. They are really public reviews. In 
secondary schools examinations are more frequent and much more rigid. 
The one preceding graduation in classical schools is exceedingly rigid. 
This is to protect the universities from poorly-prepared students. 
‘When we consider the fact that Prussia, with 30,000,000 inhabitants, 
has 357, 912 pupils in secondary schools. it is obvious that some power- 
ful stimulus to higher education must exist in that country. Mere love 
of learning would not adequately account for the high percentage of 
youths seeking a higher intellectual plane. The motive is found in the 
fact that by Government decree students who have passed through a 
six years’ course of high school are entitled to a reduction of the term 
of their military service from three years to one year. 
Ever since the establishment of schools in Germany the discipline 
‘has been strict. It is based upon the presumption that reverence for 
elders and obedience to the superiors of the children must be expected, 
and if wanting must be enforced. German children are usually docile 
- and obedient; harsh measures are not often resorted to. No law exists 
prohibiting corporal punishment, but it is well understood that ex- 
treme cases are met and dealt with severely by the functionaries of the 
law. 
Promotions in the elementary schools are very regular, because 
school attendance is regular, and also because many cities have special 
classes for mentally weak children, partly for the purpose of saving 
them for society; partly also in order to relieve schools of children who 
_ are apt to retard progress. In secondary schools, particularly in the 
classical schools, a great deal of sifting is being done. It is not a rare -

  oceurrence that in a school of 500 to 600 students only a dozen gradu- 
ate, that is, complete the entire course of 8 or 9 years. 
School organization.—The Prussian schoolhouses are as a rule in- 
sufficient and poorly ventilated. During the last twenty years, how- 
ever, great progress has been made in school architecture. The grounds 
are very frequently used as school gardens for the purpose of aiding 
the work in school, that is, object lessons, botany, floriculture, and ar- 
poriculture. The schoolrooms are small and mostly all overcrowded. 
Until recently nowhere were the pupils seated at single desks; sore 
long rows with settees attached are seen. 
Compulsory attendance prescribed by law is between the ages of 6 
(completed) and 14 (completed); in the rural districts 6 and 13, Con- 
firmation in church signifies termination of the school course. Fines 
and even imprisonment await parents and guardians in cases of re- 
peated absence of their children from school without valid excuse. 
Laws against child labor in factories are made unnecessary by this 
compulsory attendance law. 
The hours in school are 8 to 12 and 2 to 4, or between 8 and 12 and 
land 3, or 8 to 2. Generally a 6-hour day is the rule. In order to re- _ 
lieve the tension. of long-protracted intellectual work, short recesses of 
5, 10, and 15 minutes are arranged after each lesson. The school year 
begins at Easter, with a term of five weeks, then a vacation of one week 
at Whitsuntide is given. In the fall, that is, either in September or 
October, a harvest vacation of either three or four weeks closes the 
summer semester. At Christmas another vacation of one week is 
given, and from then until Easter the schools are in uninterrupted 
session. This gives six to-seven weeks of vacation and at least forty- 
five weeks of school, Legal holidays are, however, more frequent than 
in America, since many church festivals are celebrated also as state 
festivals, 
Libraries and museums.—It has been the custom for many years in 
Prussian schools to collect books for school libraries, hence a school 
without a few select books, both juvenile and professional, is rare. 
Secondary schools and universities are provided with large libraries, 
some of which have become famous. A ‘collection of natural objects 
for objective teaching is found in almost ali the schools of the King- 
dom. In large cities the school authorities establish and maintain 
central museums. 
The efforts to establish savings banks in schools have not been 
countenanced by the Government further than to encourage private | 
enterprise. 
Supplementary institutions.—The state maintains reform schools, 
asylums for the blind, deaf-mutes, and feeble-minded, all of which have 
the aim of elementary schools, Art, industrial, and trade schools, and 
other special schools, such as agricultural and. forestry schools, are 
subsidized, and some even wholly maintained by the state. Large

cities maintain separate schools for dullards, asylums for vagrants, 
continuation schools and orphan asylums. 
’ Besides these supplementary institutions, societies and institutes for 
scientific purposes aid the work of the schools. All classes and kinds 
of schools of a city are in intimate relation to the management of art 
academies, museums, zodlogical and botanical gardens, astronomical 
observatories, public libraries, gymnastic societies, and the theater, in 
fact, with every institution that in some degree may be important in 
assisting the. work in school.

BRIEF STATEMENT OF THE SCHOOL SYSTEM OF AUSTRIA. 
INTRODUCTION. 
The Empire of Austria-Hungary is sharply divided into two parts on _ 
all questions that do not pertain to the Empire, such as war, finance, 
ete., hence the matter of education is managed separately by Austria 
(Oisleithaiia) and Hungary (Transleithania). Hach has its own school 
legislation and its own ministry of public instruction. 
I—TuHE SCHOOLS OF AUSTRIA. 
Establishment and maintenance.—The public schools are established 
- and maintained partly by the state and partly by the communities. It 
is a prerogative of the civil community to establish and maintain ele-. 
mentary schools; the state participates moderately in defraying the 
expenses for that purpose, but reserves the entire business of directing 
and supervising public instruction. The churches may establish ele- 
mentary schools, but they can not participate in the state’s subsidies 
until they comply with the legal requirements regarding course of study, 
professional preparation of teachers, etc. The Government, in its 
annual statistical reports concerning school statistics, refrains from, 
stating the amounts spent for public education. The annual appro- 
priations passed by Parliament allow the minister of public instruction 
$8,307,774 for all kinds of public educational institutions, elementary 
and secondary schools, universities, technical and art schools, museums, 
and philanthropic institutions. Generally, this principle is adhered to 
by the state, to subsidize the highest institutions of learning most 
liberally, to share the cost of maintaining secondary schools with church 
and community, and to leave the burden of maintaining elementary 
schools almost entirely to the local or communal authorities. It is 
' reasonable to compare Austria with Hungary, similar-conditions having 
prevailed for more than a century in both countries. We find that the 
ratio of the state’s participation in bearing the burden of expense for 
public education in Hungary in 1889-90 was 1.08 per cent for elementary, 
24.2 per cent for secoadar y,; and 67 per cent for higher education. 
While these ratios may not hold good for Austria, they will at least 
give an illustration of the state’s policy.

      Poles “EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
In the Austrian public schools no distinctions are made with the 
pupils as regards their religious confessions. The schools are open to 
all, and are therefore common schools in the sense in which that term 
is employed with us. In Prussia it is the policy of the Government to 
separate the pupils of different religious confessions in separate ele- 
mentary, but not to separate them in secondary schools. In Austria 
and Hungary, special teachers of religion for the elementary and sec- 
ondary schools are employed; in Prussia thisis done only in secondary 
schools, while religion is taught by the secular teachers in elementary 
schools. This is a very vital difference, and shows how much nearer 
the Austrian schools have come to our ideal of a common school. Pri- 
vate efforts in founding and supporting a variety of educational insti- 
tutions, different in scope, character and aims, are more frequent in 
“ middle and higher than in elementary education, but all such instita- 
tions are encouraged by the Government, and when they have proven 
to be of abiding benefit to the community, the Government grants them 
a subsidy, and subsequently incorporates them into the state school 
system. If we study the statistical summary on p. 451 we see what a 
variety of special schools are found in Austria. The following table is

_ THE SCHOOL SYSTEM OF AUSTRIA. 467 
A comparison of the numbers in column “sex” will show that Austria 
makes no provision for secondary education for girls, since the see- 
ondary institutions lead up to the universities and polytechnica which 
are closed to women. Girls who aim at a higher education than the 
elementary school offers attend various kinds of special schools and 
private citizens’ or superior elementary schools. The proportion of 
female students (1 to 2) in the normal schools is much greater than in 
Prussia, where itis1 to 10. While officially women are not matricu- 
lated as students in the wniversities, they are permitted to attend the 
lectures, but that does not admit them to the state examinations nor to 
the privileges arising from having attended a university and having 
graduated from it. f 
Administration and supervision—The minister of public instruction, 
amember of the imperial cabinet, has the general direction and super- 
vision of all educational institutions of the Empire. He is charged with 
watching over the execution of the laws, and to prepare such bills as 
will from time to time become necessary to amend the laws. The Em- 
pire is divided into erownlands, or, properly speaking, the Empire has 
grown to its present size by the acquisition on the part of the Crown of 
the following countries (hence called’ crownlands) : Archduchies of 
Lower and Upper Austria, Kingdom of Bohemia, Margraviate Mora- 
via, Duchy of Silesia, Archbishopric Salzburg, Duchy of Styria, 
Duchy of Carinthia, Duchy of Carnolia,.County of Tyrol, Kingdom of 
-Galicia,! County of Bukowina, and the coastland on the Adriatic. 
Their area and population vary considerably. At the head of the ad- 
ministrative affairs of each erownland stands a governor (“ Statthal- 
ter”) who has a cabinet of councilors for the different branches of ad- 
ministration, such as land office, judicial office, school department, ete. 
The head of the school department is the general superintendent of the 
erownland (Landes-Schulinspector), He is the organ of intereommu- 
nication between the minister and lower authorities. He also watches 
over the execution of orders issued by the supreme authorities of the 
crownland. Each crownland is divided into “ Bezirke” or school dis- 
tricts, the schools of which are directed and supervised by a “ Bezirks- 
schulrath” (board of supervisors of the district). These boards have 
chiefly to perform supervisory functions, and consist of professional 
teachers from all Glasses of the profession from elementary, secondary, 
and superior schools. They are nominaté@ by the teachers of the dis- 
trict and appointed by higher school authorities. These district boards 
are the organs of intercommunication between higher and lower school 
authorities and courts of appeal in cases of disagreement between 
teachers and local boards. The districts are not synonymous with our 
school districts, but with our counties. Each of them has a number of 
loeal school districts with local school boards. The local districts are 
_ similar in size and number of inhabitants to our township and school 
1The imperial school law does not apply to Galicia. 
 
-P-A-G-E-496
      468 EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-80, 
distriets. Some cities of importance are large enough to eonstitute 
Bezirke (counties), and in that case the elementary schools are all un- 
der the immediate direction of one local board, usually a committee of 
the city council. Thé burgomaster or mayor in that case is the highest 
local authority. In rural districts that authority is exercised by the 
chief functionary of the civil government. Thus it is seen that from 
the local authorities upward to the imperial government there is an as- 
cending scale of administrative and directive as well as supervisory 
authorities. 5 ‘ 
The administration of secondary schools varies according to the 
nature of the school. If it is a State or city school, the authorities of 
the erownland or the city and the imperial government direct and 
supervise it; if it is a church school the church authorities do it, subject 
- to the law which prescribes supervision; if-it is a private or a secondary 
school maintained by societies or private individuals, the school must 
submit to the state’s supervision or lose the benefits arising from the 
state’s acknowledgment. It is the custom to give to each secondary 
school, even to state schools, a local board of trustees whose functions 
are executive, but in all cases the rector or principal is a member of this 
board. In a general way it may be said, the duties and functions of 
local school boards and boards of trustees are the same as such boards 
have with us, but all the schools stand under one and the same imperial 
Jaw and the direction of the minister of instruction, who, in conformity 
with that law, defines the lines of the courses of study and determiries 
» the requirements for examination and proniotion, ete. 
The elementary or peoples’ schools of Austria have little direct super- 
vision, because the teachers in Austria must have acquired professional 
training before their application is confirmed by the authorities. Still 
there is a general supervision exercised by the state and a local super- 
vision by the “ Bezirksschulrath” (county board of supervisors). The 
candidates for these boards are professional teachers; they are nomi- 
nated by the teachers of the county and appointed by the authorities 
of the crownland. It has been the policy to-select for the office of 
_ “ Bezirksschulrath” men who have won distinction in certain lines of 
duty, so that the fall board should represent all branches of the courses 
of study. Thus, one member supervises mathematical, another scien- 
tific, a third linguistic studies. Local superintendents as we have 
them, who inspect the school$ of all grades, and examine the progress 
made in all the branches, are not found in AuStria, nor anywhere in 
German-speaking countries. Even in Prussia, where professional local 
superintendents (inspectors) are employed, these officials supervise 
‘only elementary schools. While the office of inspector in Prussia isin 
many cases a supplementary one, filled by normal school principals, 
clergymen, teachers of higher schools, or principals of middle schools, 
we find that in Austria the inspectors (members of the county board of 
supervisors) employ their whole time in the duties of their office. To

higher authorities to the office of county board of supervisors, it means < 
a promotion in rank and salary; but their duties are far from being 
pleasant, since they are placed between the upper and lower millstones, 
i.e., the erownland school authorities and the local school boards, and 
having less directive power than thelocal boards, a clash of authorities 
occurs frequently. a 
These boards of supervisors report to the higtien authorities, aid the 
teachers in their professional advancement, and stimulate the local 
boards to action where inactivity is more to the liking of the people. 
Teachers.—The professional preparation of teachers in Austria is the 
source of strength of the people’s or elementary schools. The first at- 
tempts of the Government at improving the schools were directed at 
establishing normal schools. 
In 1889 Austria had 69 normal schools, with 972 professors and 9,415 — 
students. Forty-two of these schools were for men, 39 for women. In 
1889 there were, however, still 5.3 per cent of the teachers without a 
diploma, and 10.1-per cent who held only a diploma issued by local au- 
thorities. The course of study in normal schools in Austria is one of 
two and three years. It embraces a thorough review of the common 
branches, the so-ealled high-school branches, theoretical and practical 
instruction in instrumental music, drawing, gymnastics, and pedagogy 
(which includes history of education, elementary psychology, theory 
and practice of teaching). In 8 of these schools two languages are 
spoken; in 39, German is spoken exclusively; in 12, Bohemian; in 6, 
Polish; in 2, Italian; in 2, Servian exclusively. 
Appointment and position.—The appointment of teachers is regulated. 
by the law of May 14, 1869, which says: “The provisional appointment 
of teachers is made by the county board of supervisors (Bezirksschul- 
rath), but the definite appointment by the school authorities of the | 
crownland (Landesschulbehérde) upon nomination by those authorities 
who maintain the school. Promotions to higher rates of salaries are 
made by the school authorities of the crownland. Hence the law pre- 
scribes in the main tlre same principle adhered to in Prussia, that the 
local authorities choose the teachers and the Government confirms or 
rejects the appointment. The legal and social position of teachers in 
Austria is well defined by the law; he is an officer of the state; his 
minimum salary is guaranteed by the state (or crownland); his annual 
increase in salary depends upon the financial ability of the locality, and 
varies in different cities and distriets; he receives a pension after a 
certain number of years of service, which pension is the same as given 
other officers of the state receiving a like amount of salary. Widows 
and orphans of teachers are also entitled to support. Codperative soci- 
eties enable the teachers of cities to save something out of their slender 
income, and they are resorted to frequently. 
Salaries.—It is impossible to state the amount of salary paid to — 
       
-P-A-G-E-498
          
      oe 
  _teachers in Austria for reasons previously mentioned. Only little in- 
formation has been received, but enough to indicate that the salaries 
are much lower than in this country and also lower than those paid in 
Germany and France. While in large cities, such as Vienna, the 
teachers enjoy comparatively good incomes, in far remote crownlands 
like Tyrol, Bukowina, etc., they live in great want and poverty. Ad- 
“vertisements of local boards in Tyrol, are published, not wnfrequently 
calling for teachers at salaries of $79 a year, and even less for women. 
The city of Vienna has-recently adopted a new schedule of salaries for 
the teachers of middle and elementary-schools, which is very instruc- 
tive since it affords a standard of comparison. with salaries paid in 
other large'cities. It will be found on page 428. The minimum salary 
of teachers according to this new schedule ranges between $285.60 and 
$392. 70; of principals, between $428.40 and $545.50; the maximum 
Saris (including annual increases) of teachers range between $392.70 
and $731.85; of principals, between $464.10 and $928.20. 
Course of study.—The course of study in purely elementary schools 
embraces: Religion, reading and writing (the mother tongue, the me- 
dium. of instruction), arithmetic and elementary geometry, geography, 
and history, with special reference to Austria, elementary natural his- 
tory and science, drawing, singing, industrial handiwork for girls, and 
gymnastics (obligatory for boys, but optional for girls). The extent to 
which these branches are tatight is determined by the grade which the 
school has reached. If fully graded, as schools generally are in cities, 
much more is expected than in ungraded country schools. The time- 
tables used in the different schools, graded, partly graded, and fully 
graded, are prescribed by the minister of instruction. 
For superior elementary schools, so-called “biirger” or citizen’s 
schools, the branches prescribed by law are, religion, language (compo- 
sition of business letters of various kinds), geography, and history (with 
‘special reference to Austria and its constitution), natural history, natural 
science, arithmetic and simple bookkeeping, geometry and geometrical 
construction, free-hand drawing, penmanship, singing, industrial hand- 
iwork for gixls, gymnastics (obligatory for boys, optional for girls). In 
schools where the German language is not the medium of instruction 
it is made a branch of study. 
These superior elementary schools consist of three grades or classes, 
and receive their pupils from the primary elementary schools at the age 
of 11 or 12 years. In primary elementary schools the sexes are taught 
together in the same rooms; in superior es schools the sexes 
are separated, 
The text-books used in all Sunken schools are chosen by the 
teachers’ conference of a district, but the selection is subject to the ap- 
proval of the school authorities of the crownland, the action of whieh 
- in turn is subject to the approval of the minister. 
The teachers in Austria have the greatest possible liberty in the

    THE SCHOOL SYSTEM OF AUSTRIA. - afi eS 
selcetion of the methods of teaching. No inspector prescribes methods, 
but in the conference of teachers in the district (Bezirk) the inspector 
(Schulrath) suggests improvements where he thinks them necessary. 
Branches of study.—Religion: For this branch special teachers, usu- ~ 
ally clergymen, are employed (Austria had in 1889, 45,705 secular and 
13,875 clerical teachers in elementary schools); the law leaves the 
amount of matter to be learned to the “religious denominations.” 
Reading, writing, and languages: The extent of these branches is the 
usual one, namely, familiarity with the vernacular, a limited knowledge_ 
of German literature, and some skill in oral and written expression 
of thought. Arithmetic: In this branch less work is .done than in 
American schools, percentage and interest, is all that is attempted of _ 
business rules; but mensuration and geometrical construction is taught 
in close connection with elementary geometry. Singing: This consists 
chiefly in the singing of hymns and popular airs. Two and three part 
music is. quite frequently heard even in remote village schools. In 
Bohemia and other parts of the Empire many children learn instru-- 
mental music in school also, chiefly the violin. Geography: This study 
is limited to topographical and political geography. Austria is treated 
with more thoroughness than other countries, but when History is 
taken up the geography of Europe and of other continents comes in for a 
share of attention. For history the law prescribes that home history 
and the constitution should claim special attention, No. text-books 
are used for geography and history, except a small atlas. Natural his- 
tory and science (in one word Natur-Kunde or knowledge of nature): 
These studies are very elementary, and limited to object lessons in 
school gardens and primitive laboratories with home-made apparatus. 
- Gymnastics is obligatory for boys, but optional for girls, while indus- 
trial handiwork is obligatory for girls. Drawing is free-hand, except so 
far as connected with geometrical construction. Manual training for 
boys is not prescribed officially, but private efforts in this direction are 
greatly encouraged and even subsidized by the Government. All these 
branches are extended in scope in the superior elementary schools, 
composition in German and natural science especially. 
What branches are taught in the secondary schools and in what 
years of the course can best be seen from the four graphie charts 
offered in the report of this Bureau of 1889 (sée pages 173-176). The sec- 
ondary schools, Gymnasia and Realschulen, of central Europe vary but 
slightly in the essential features of their courses of study. There is 
only one essential difference between the Austrian and Hungarian secon- 
dary schools; it is this, that Hungary does net maintain that hybrid 
form of Scans ry schools called Realgymnasium; it has only oes 
nasia and Realschulen, 
The language used as medium of instruction in Austrian elementary 
schools is German in 42.4 per cent of the schools, Bohemian in 24.8 per 
cent, Polish in 9.6 per cent, Ruthenian in 10.2 per ecnt, Slavonian in 
       
-P-A-G-E-500

-3.2 per cent, Italian in 4.9 per cent, Servian in 1.8 per cent, Roumanian 
in 0.5 per cent. Mixed schools in which several languages are spoken 
claim 2.6 per cent of the whole number. 
School management.—The ministerial interpretation of the law of 
1869, published in 1883, contains the following points concerning the 
management and courses of study: 
Section 1 of the minister’s regulations says: All courses of study 
must be submitted to the school authorities of the crownland. * * * 
During the first three years of the course much attention is to be be- 
stewed upon exercises in language, reading, and orthography and 
mental arithmetic. * * * In selecting matter for natural history 
and science, geography and history, the measure of juvenile compre- 
" _hension and normal conditions of life should be carefully considered. 
* * * Yn dividing the matter for the different grades of a school, 
the ability of the average pupil should be considered... * * * 
In section 4 the following points are brought out: In Biirger (citi- 
zens’ or superior elementary) schools the sexes are to be separated. 
* * * The concentric method of dividing the matter of instruction 
isto be followed. * * * The maximum number of hours of instruc- 
tion per week is fixed at 30. * * * The number of lessons, as well 
as the amount of matter to be learned in the different branches, must 
always depend upon special practical needs of localities where either 
certain industrial conditions demand greater efforts in drawing, chem- 
istry, etc., or where agricultural pursuits require more attention to 
natural history and physics. Hence school gardens and tree nurseries 
are to-be established in rural districts, laboratories and drawing rooms 
in-cities. * * * Every course of study must contain a statement of 
the number of hours necessary for'doing home lessons in each grade of 
school. 
From the foregoing quotations it may be seen that all legal and min- 
_ isterial regulations state.only principles to be followed and prescribe 
rules of administration and management in outlines only; it is left to 
the lower authorities to carry out the law inharmony with local needs. 
Examinations for promotions are rarein Austrian elementary schools; 
the estimate of the class teacher is usually sufficient. Most examina- 
tions are oral and consist in public reviews, commonly instituted to 
establish a closer connection between home and schools. In secondary 
schools, that is, schools which lead up to universities and polytechnica, 
an examination for promotion is held every year. The final examina- 
tion is both oral and in writing. All final examinations are conducted 
by the faculties in presence of higher. school authorities, such as 
“Tandes-Sculrath” (general superintendent of the crown land) or his 
deputy. 
- In Austria the same rule that prevails in Prussia is found, namely 
that graduation from, or a six years’ course in, a secondary school, re- 
duces the time of military service of a student to one year.

  ~ THE SCHOOL SYSTEM OF AUSTRIA. 473 
The discipline in Austrian schools does not materially differ from 
that of German schools. Corporal punishment is not forbidden. The 
law allows the teacher the same mode of treatment which it allows the 
father. Harsh measures are not resorted to very frequently. 
School organization.—The law of 1869, and its interpretation on the 
part of the minister, issued in 1883, contain a number of interesting 
features. Section 11 says: ‘If within three successive years the num 
ber of pupils in elementary schools has reached 80 a second teacher, 
and if the number reaches 160 a third teacher must be employed, and - 
soon. In half-day schools 100 pupils in two sections are the limit. 
Section 13 says: For ungraded schools (schools of one room and less — 
than 80 pupils) a teacher must be employed. _ If two or three are needed 
one of them may temporarily be an assistant. In graded schools of 5 
or more classes two temporary assistants may be employed. The other 
teachers are associates, and the first or -head teacher is responsible for 
the order of the building and the reports, but not for the teaching of 
his associates. The head. teacher of a Biirger or citizens’ school bears 
' the title rector or director. If the Biirgerschule is fully graded, that 
is, if it has 5 elementary and 3 higher elementary classes, it bears 
the name people’s and citizens’ school. 
Of late years Austria has made great progress in school architecture. 
The school buildings in cities are remarkably beautiful and commodi- 
ous. Vienna set a good example for other parts of the Empire in its 
* school buildings, which are the pride of the people. New buildings are 
usually erected of sandstone and contain, beside the necessary class 
rooms and spacious corridors, a gymnastic hall. If viewed in the light 
of American custom they seem overcrowded; ‘but, then, crowded school- 
rooms are the rule in central Europe. In Prussia the normal number 
of pupils is 75; in Saxony, 70; in Austria, 80; except in half-day 
schools, where 50 is the number in each class. 
Single desks are not found in Austria (eyewitnesses report this), but 
the children sit on long settees attached to desks. (See Klassen’s 
Sch ulgebiiude.) 
Compulsory attendance, prescribed by law, is between the ages of 6 
and 14, This law is executed by the local authorities, who do not 
always act promptly, hence, nearly 11 per cent of the school population 
of the Empire, especially in Slavic crown lands, escape enrollment. 
Particulars concerning the execution of the law may be found on page 
429, The supervisory authorities have the right to excuse the children 
of needy parents for half a day, or for two days in the week, and dur- 
ing the last two years of the course they may release the pupils for a 
half or even a whole year from attending. Confirmation in church does 
not as in Prussia signify the termination of the school course, but the 
completion of-the course, which may be effected at 13 years of age. 
The hours are variously fixed at from 8 to 12 and 2 to 4, or from 8 to 
12 and 1 to 3, or from 8 to 1 and 3 to 4, or from 8 to 2. In half-day 
        
     
-P-A-G-E-502
  aq "| EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
schools the hours are from 8 to 12 and 1to 5. All-day schools have 
6, half-day schools 4 hours study. The vacations vary little from those 
jn Germany: 1 week at Christmas, 1 week at Easter, 1 week at Whit- 
suntide, 3 or 4 weeks at Harvest time; rarely do they amount to more 
than 6 or 7 weeks a year. 
Equipment of schools.—The elementary schools all have at least a nu- 
eleus of a library, a primitive collection of objects for natural history, 
and some apparatus for physics. Rural schools all have a school gar- 
~den, while city schools are provided with facilities for. the promotion of 
studies that will aid industrial city life. 
Supplementary institutions —The state maintains reform schools, asy- 
Iums for the blind, deaf-mutes, and feeble-minded, all of which have 
the character of philanthropic institutions, and the education offered in 
them does not go beyond the limits and purposes of elementary educa- 
tion, if at allit reaches that limit. Austria maintains also a number 
of special schools, some wholly, some partly professional. These have 
grown out of the needs of the localities in which they are found and 
were originally founded by private enterprise. Many-of them obtain 
governmental aid. These schools are classed under the following sub- 
heads: Commercial, trade, music, agricultural, mining, veterinary, nau- 
tical, female industrial, and other special schools. This group of schools 
_is by no means small, it has 8,678 teachers and professors and 122,968 
students and pupils.

THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM OF NORWAY. 
[Constitutional monarchy; area, 123,205 square miles; population (at close of 
1880), 1,913,000. Capital, Christiania; population, 130,027, January, 1886. Minister 
of Education and Ecclesiastical Affairs, Jakob Aall. Bonnevie,? appointed July 12,

INTRODUCTORY SKETCH. 
Norway, which had been for some time an independent country, was 
reunited to Denmark and to Sweden at the close of the fourteenth cen- 
tury by a treaty signed at Calmar in 1397. Insurmountable obstacles 
to such a union were ‘soon encountered, and in 1527 a definite severing 
of the bond resulted, which left Norway dependent upon Denmark. 
In 1814 Norway recovered a certain degree of autonomy. Separated 
from Denmark by the treaty of Vienna, she became a constitutional 
state united to Sweden through the person of her sovereign, but pos- 
sessing a national parliament and with the power of legislative action. 
Of these three Scandinavian countries Norway is the one where the in- 
stitutions are the most demoeratic. The title of noble was abolished 
in 1821. The state religion is Lutheran, although formerly the Catho- 
lies were in the ascendancy, and it may be stated that religion is @ 
* main element in the schools. The character and the speech of the Nor- 
wegian people resemble those of the Swedes and Danes. By the peas- 
ants, and outside the large towns in general, are spoken various dialects 
or corruptions of the old Norse, which was common up to the fourteenth 
century to all the Seandinavian race. The language of literature and of 
_ society is the Danish, a natural outgrowth ef the long domination of 
Denmark over that country.

RIG E EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. > | 
The constitution of Norway, ealled the Grundloy, dates from Novem- 
ber 4, 1814, after the reunion of that country with Sweden, with modi- 
fications at different dates to 1889. - This reunion does not prevent Nor- 
“way’s preserving its own organization and refusing to submit to any 
laws except those made by itself. One king governs the two countries, 
however; the foreign relations are the same, and the diplomatic corps 
is credited. to bothcountries.« In othermatters Nerway preserves its 
own autonomy. The legislative power, is vested in the Storthing, 
which is divided into two houses, the Lagthing and the Odelthing, the 
‘former being composed of one-fourth of the members of the Storthing, 
the latter of three-fourths, of the same. The Storthing enacts or repeals 
laws, imposes taxes, supervises the financial affairs of the government, 
_ voting amounts required for expenditure, etc. All proposed laws are 
first introduced in the Odelthing and then pass to the Lagthing. 
The executive is represented by the King, who is aided by a council 
of state, composed of two ministers and at least seven councilors.. They 
are entitled to be present in the Storthing and to take part in the discus: 
. sions, but not to yote. The King has not the power to dissolve the 
Storthing, only to veto its decisions. When the King leaves the country 
the minister and two councilors leave with him; the other councilors 
act with a lieutenant-general, or (if he be a prince royal), a vice-king ap-~ 
pointed by the King, but who may not bea Norwegian. He resides at 
Christiania and submits all mattersto the King. Affairs common to 
both countries are decided in Sweden, the Norwegian members having 
the power of voting.! : : 
Norway is divided into 20 counties, i. ¢., the towns of Christiania and 
Bergen and 18 counties or Amter, each of these ‘governed by an Amt- 
mand or chief executive functionary. These Amter are subdivided 
into 39 towns and 56 Fogderier, the latter comprising 22 Ladesteder, 
or ports, and 494 Herreder, or rural communes, which are mostly par- 
ishes or wards. The government of the Herred_is vested in a council 
and abody of representatives. ‘The three to nine Formendene, or coun- 
' cilors, are elected from the different wards of the commune. The rep- 
resentatives who vote the expenditure of the Herréd are three times as 
many as the councilors. These bodies elect conjointly every year a 
chairman and deputy chairman from among the Formendene. All the - 
chairmen of an Amt form, with the Amtmand and the Fogder, or sher- 
iffs, the Amtsformandskab, or county diet, which holds an annual meet- 
ing to prepare the county budget. The chief functionary of the county 
is chairman of this body. The towns and ports form 58 communes, also 
governed by a council (4 to 12 members; 15 in Christiania) and by 
- representatives, who outnumber the councilors threefold. The mem- 
bers of both local governing bodies are elected by voters for the Stor- 
thing in towns and rural communes. 
1In the fall of 1891 the Norwegians were earnestly engaged in discussing the pes- 
sibility of greater independence, especially in diplomatic and commercial relations.

  THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM OF NORWAY. ATT. 
The administrative, ecclesiastical, and educational authorities are 
united in their efforts to promote education in Norway. The Storthing 
has given material aid since the establishment of the independence of 
Norway in 1814. The chief official of each of the counties and the 
bishop of each diocese are members of the board of such divisions, which 
board looks after educational interests. The municipal council votes 
“on the school budget, and some of its members belong to the district 
school board, while a prominent member of each local school committee 
is a clergyman. 
DISTINCTIVE FEATURES OF THE SCHOOL SYSTEM PRIOR TO SCHOOL 
LAW OF 1889.! 
During the Danish domination very little was done for the instruction 
of the people. After the formation of the constitution in 1814 the Nor- 
wegian politicians commenced to discuss the organization of elementary 
schools most earnestly, but it is stated that the present school system, 
which is an establishment of the state, is based upon a decree of 1736, 
by which no child could be admitted to confirmation unless it had fre- 
quented a school and had been instructed in the principal dogmas of 
Christianity. This was followed by a decree of 1739, which, however, ' 
did not take the topography of the country into consideration, for in Nor-” 
way, as in Sweden, there exist many ambulatory’schools, and modifica- 
tions were made necessary in 1741. By these laws instruction in reading 
and religion was made obligatory for all children from 7 years of age to 
that of confirmation, which generally takes place in the fifteenth year. 
The organization of the university dates from 1824, although it was 
founded in 1811, while the most comprehensive law for all educational 
purposes was that of 1827, followed, however, by a law of 1848, apply- 
ing particularly,to city schools. These laws were replaced in part by 
one of May 16, 1860, which, with modifications in 1869, appertaining to 
higher grade educational institutions, and with other modifications in 
1873, 1878, and 1881, were in force to date of June, 1889, when a new 
law was promulgated. : 
According to the earlier laws the elementary schools, Almueskoler, 
were divided into rural and urban, and in each town there was 
to be at least one school organized according to the law of 1848, 
while in rural districts the law of May 16, 1860, governed the school 
  
1The latest statistics for Norway are for the year 1888, hence a general survey of 
the school system prior to that date seems advisable. Under each heading or Sub- 
division of the school system a short statement is presented, which statement gives 
the status of that subdivision prior to the year 1888, as showing the basis on which 
the statements were founded. Each of these statements is followed by points of the 
new law which apply to that special subdivision, so that any changes may be made 
elear to the reader. The new law, which goes into effect during a three-year period 
from July, 1889, in urban and five in rural districts, will form the basis of future 
presentations of education in Norway.

organization, Each rural district, Herred, was formed. of one or 
more school communes, Skolekommaner, and again subdivided into 
circles or Skolekredse, thé size of which is determined by the commu- 
nal s¢hool commission, Skolekommission—it may be stated here that a 
school district averages from twelve to fourteen circles. Each circle 
was required to have an elementary school, Aredskole, or, if the dis- 
tances were too great for the children to come, an ambulatory school, 
Omgangskole, was carried on. There were formerly great numbers 
of these, but by degrees they have been blended with the station- 
ary schools. In localities where it was possible these lower grade 
‘schools were supplemented by a higher elementary school, hdicre 
Almueskole, which might’ be maintained by several circles in com- 
mon. The laws of 1848 and 1860 also governed the establishment 
of private schools which could only be opened by persons of good 
moral character, who pledged themselves to conform to the regula- 
tions for school programmes, etc., laid down by the school authori- 
ties. Among the private schools are about 70 schools for girls, 
which schools have, however, no special plan of organization, and con- 
sequently prominent educators are discussing the propriety of admit- 
ting girls to the schools established for boys, so as to give both sexes 
equal privileges. There are also infant schools which, however, have 
no connection with the public-school system. For forty years the city 
of Christiania has supported four of these asylums. The directresses 
ate chosen by the muncipality and have no specific regulations laid 
down for them, but can teach the children as they please. Each of the 
six dioceses into which Norway is divided was to Have a state normal 
school, Seminariwm, for the education of teachers, and by the law of 
May 16, 1860, normal schools of a lesser grade, Laererskoler, were to be 
attached to the higher elementary schools, or become the highest class 
of the Kredskole. Teachers in the public schools were presumed to have 
passed a normal-school examination or the equivalent of the same else- 
where. The appointments to many of the higher places came direct 
‘from the King or the department of education, while the school com- 
mission, diocesan board of directors, or bishops appointed eee in 
the lower grade schools. 
Secondary schools, also established by the state, include middle 
schools, kommunale Middelskoler, and Gymnasia, which are subdivided 
into Latin and real gymnasia, Latin og Realskoler, and there are also 
private schools of a secondary grade. 
The University at Christiania, with its five faculties, and the special 
schools for philological studies, physical and mathematical studies, 
mining and forestry schools, industrial and commercial schools, the ag- 
ricultural schools in almost ev ery county, the higher agr feultaral schools. 
(hétere Landboiskole), navigation schools, military Ligh school, military 
and naval school, and the polytechnic, ete., serve to complete the school 
system. 
 
-P-A-G-E-507
THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM OF NORWAY. A479 
The general control of the educational system is vested in the depart- 
ment of ecclesiastical affairs and public instruction, Kirke og Under- 
visnings-Departementet (law, July 12, 1848, and May 16, 1860), which is 
required to furnish a report every third year to the King and Storthing 
as to the condition of educational affairs throughout the kingdom. 
The ecclesiastical authorities of the seventy-seven deaneries into 
which Norway is divided are by law invested with the higher inspee- 
  tion of schools and the control of school committees., The deans are: — 
aecountable to the diocesan director. Each of the six dioceses has its 
director, This Stiftsdirektion includes the bishop, the chief officer of 
the diocese, and the school inspector, who is appointed by the King and 
paid by the state. Each of these higher school boards is required to 
send in an annual report to the department of education. 
Each county, or Amt, has for local supervision itscouncil, which acts 
as a county school board, meeting annually and having among its mem- 
bers the chairmen of all the municipal councils in the county. The 
immediate supervision of the schools is vested in a school commission 
(Skolekommission) in each city or district, which commission includes © 
as members the pastors and vicars of the parish, a member of the mu- 
nicipal council and delegates of theeommunalcouncil. Eachschooldis- . 
trict (the ordinary school district in the country has limits similar to 
those of the municipal districts) is governed by dual authority, by the 
school committee, whichis purely administrative, and by the muiiicipal 
council, which has charge of the school fund. 
Elementary education is generally spoken of as gratuitous, but the 
local school board. with the consent of the municipal council can exact 
a small school fee from parents whose children attend more than twelve 
weeks. The parents if able also furnish text books and school material 
to their children. These pay schools and free schools have no distinct 
divisions; the paying pupils, which are few in number, may be found in 
the school in the morning hours, the free pupils in the afternoon. ‘The 
schools are maintained by district, county, and state fands, the elemen- 
tary schools being supported by a district school fund derived from in- 
terest funds, voluntary gifts, fines, and contributions from the state, 
etc. It may be stated that each municipal district forms a school dis- 
trict. From this common fund are paid the expenses of building, re- 
pair and hire of school-houses. Each circle of a district must pay for 
heating and lighting of the school and for the lodging and food of the 
teacher during the schoolterm. Each of the twenty counties, or Amter, 
into which Norway is divided, has its school fund out of which (law of 
May 16, 1860) are paid the increase of salary for teachers (teachers? 
salaries are granted by the school districts, the minimum being fixed 
by the council according to the number of weeks school is kept open), 
contributions for higher schoels and for work schools, for erection of 
schooLhouses and purchase of land for school teachers, for promotion ~ 
of education in poor parishes, and for compensation to schoolmasters

who fit pupils to be teachers. School taxes imposed by the council are - 
assessed in proportion to the relative value of the estate. City schools 
are supported entirely by the municipal district and receive no-aid from 
the state. Secondary schools are maintained by the municipality or 
by funds which have accrued to the department of public instruction 
by the sale of lands belonging to the church. In certain cases the 
Ivatin-schootshave funds of their own, but the most of them depend 
upon state and municipality. Normal schools are established and 
maintained by the government. The university is maintained by the’ 
state or by its own funds, the student having no fees to pay. The 
agricultyral schools are supported by state and district funds. 
Summarized, the laws of 1860, 1869, 1878, and 1881 for public elemen- 
tary schools in rural districts, and 1848 and 1869 for city or town 
_ schools, indicate a school system which is compulsory for at least a 
minimum of twelve weeks in the country for all children from eight 
years to confirmation, and seven years to confirmation in the town; 
special instruction being provided for ‘backward or vagrant children. 
Tn towns all children are instructed in stationary schools; in many rural 
districts ambulatory schools exist. The schools are mixed in the coun- 
try, but -coeducation is not general in towns, although girls have 
permission to enter higher grade elementary schools; continuation 
schools and night schools aid in the education of the people, but at- 
tendance isnot compulsory, the small fees in these schools aid in defray- 
ing expenses; the laws provide for the curriculum of study in the ele- 
mentary schools, that of the city being more extensive than in rural 
schools; religious instruction—Evangelical Lutheran—being obliga- 
tary except for Dissenters, statutory provision as to extent holding good 
‘for the higher grade schools only; promotions occur from class to 
class after examination each summer; elementary instruction isin gen-. 
eral gratuitous, secondary not enheay so, in the public high schools 
the fees for the parents varying from 80 to 140 crowns ($21 to $37) per 
annum; elementary schools are maintained by public funds and volun- 
tary contributions, the expenses being paid directly from the Govern- 
ment, the county treasury, and the locality—the higher grade schools 
(grammar) by the locality, with Government subsidy; cost of elemen- 
tary schools per pupil is about 9 to 10 crowns in the country ($2.68) to 
24 crowns ($6.53) in the city; teachers of elementary schools in the 
country are appointed by the school commission, for the lower elemen- 
tary by the diocesan board of directors, in the towns by the bishop, in 
“the higher grades by the king or by the ecclesiastical department— 
they are supposed to be graduates of normal schools or to have passed : * : 2.

($214 to $991) for men in town schools, women 400 to 1,000 crowns ($107

grade schools receive as high as $1,554, with house rent free; super-

tion, which is abranch of the Ministry of Ecclesiastical Affairs; those 
who report as to immediate supervision are the bishops and school di- 
rectors of each diocese, forming with the civil governor a diocesan 
board of directors, the school commission, local boards, and district in- 
spectors. : 
PRESENT STATUS OF EDUCATION.} 
Such are the main features of the Norwegian school system to date 
of 1889. On June 26 of that. year a new school law was promulgated 
which will be enforced by degrees. The limit is a three years’ period 
in cities and a five years’ period (following the date of July, 1889) in 
rural districts, or, if in certain communities insurmountable difficulties 
occur, still another five years’ period will be allowed. The principal 
features of the school law of January 26, 1889, are here presented for 
both. city and rural schools. It may be stated, however, that consid- 
erable opposition to many of its provisions has been developed, and it 
is a question if certain modifications may not be made from time to 
time as the necessity occurs. The provisions provoking the most dis- 
cussion are, the leaving the arrangement of the time-tables and plan of 
instruction to the local authorities, the appointment of elementary 
teachers by local boards, and a few minor points which are susceptible 
of different interpretations. The requirement that a certain minority 
of the voters of each district meet for the election of boards of in- 
spectors has had to be given up owing to the opposition developed. 
City schools.—According to this law each town is to have a sufficient 
number of elementary schools for all children needing an education, 
Each elementary school is to be in three divisions, the first for chil- 
dren from 7 to 10 years of age, the second for those 10 to 12 years of 
age, the third for those 12 to 14 years of age. The limit of school age 
is from 64 to 15 years of age, and all children are to receive seven years? 
gratuitous schooling unless they are mentally or physically disabled, 
have some contagious disease, or belong to the incorrigible class. For 
such children special schools are established, the parents being called 
upon to pay in part for the instruction given. Classes in the elemen- 
tary grades of town-schools are not to exceed 40 pupils in number 
although, if economy requires it, the limit may be extended to 50 
pupils. For the first, or lowest di¥ision, 24 hours a week instruction 
in the different branches is to be the iimit, and this may be reduced to 
18 hours a week if the school board report to the municipal authorities 
that such a shortening of hours is advisable. The limits are therefore 18 
to 24 hours. In the second division the weekly limit of study hours is 
assigned by the municipal authorities a€cording to the suggestion of 
the school board. The third, or highest division, which depends more 
directly upon the school board, is allowed more latitude in regard to 
hours of study, reports in regard to such hours being made from time

to time during the year. If classes are formed for any special study, 
the hours are not to exceed 24 each week. If, however, there are op- 
tional studies allowed by the municipal authorities, these must in no- 
wise interfere with the ordinary branches of elementary education, 
and the combined hours of study are not to exeeced 380 hours a week. 
Optional studies may include foreign languages. 
The school vacations cover 12 weeks throughout the year although 
that limit may be extended to 16 weeks if the authorities so determine. 
If the parents are unable to furnish text-books for their children the 
school board may do so. Parents neglecting to send their children 
to school after due notification is given them will be fined from 1 to 25 
crowns (26.8 cents to $6.50), The head of any firm employing children 
between 63 and 15 years of age is required to sce that they attend 
school during the hours set apart for such instruction or pay 100 
_ crowns ($26.80). Funds accruing from fines; or from the fees required 
of parents when the children need special instruction, are to be handed 
over to the municipal authorities. Each elementary school must have 
at least one male teacher and at least one female teacher. Persons 
who desire to open private schools for pupils under 15 years of age 
must ‘so inform the school board of the town; in default of this a fine 
of 50 crowns ($13.40) is to be paid. If the person desiring such posi- 
tion is not of high moral character, the school board can‘ forbid his 
teaching any pupil under 15 years of age. If such a private school 
teacher continues to teach such pupils, the school board is at liberty 
to withdraw them from the school and place them in the public school. 
. The teacher of a private school is required to give the school board 
whatever information it desires in regard to the school or pay from 5 
to 25 crowns ($1.34 to $6.70) each week. 
Each town must have a school board to look after the interests of its 
schools and to report as to the funds required for the management of 
the schools. There is also a committee of inspection to watch over a 
group of schools, while the teachers form a school council to discuss 
“school needs, ete. The school board and council consult together. The 
bishop and dean watch over the religious instruction in the schools. 
Then there are school superintendents who form a board of higher in- 
spection, and jaunt about to take eggnizance of school matters through- 
‘out the country. They report annually to the chief of the department 
of education. The municipal council and local school boards (law of 
June, 1889, with modifications) have the power of regulating the hours 
of school and the plan of instruction in the two divisions of the ele-— 
mentary grades, but the minigfer of education and the school inspectors 
of the six dioceses have formulated a model plan for the guidance of 
these local officials. By this same law the appointment of elementary 
school teachers is intrusted to the local boards; but the school director 
can annul these appointments if, through the appointment of relatives, 
ete., they savor too much of favoritism. The municipal council and

school board are also given the power of approval of plans for new 
school buildings, but prior to a decision being reached the local board 
of health, or committee on sanitation, and the higher school authorities 
(probably those of the diocese) are expected to express their opinions 
in regard to the plan submitted. The board of health must look after 
the sanitary condition of school buildings and condemn them if un- 
healthy. If sufficient funds are voted by the municipal council, a phy- 
sician is to keep watch over the hygienic conditions in the schools of 
the district over which appointed. .The new law does not make the 
financial basis for city schools especially clear, but it would seem as | 
though the older laws, by which the maintenance of city schools was 
left entirely to the municipal district, still held good. In all matters 
appertaining to the control and maintenance of city or town schools 
there are direct consultations with the municipal authorities: As far 
as the salaries of teachers are concerned, the city anthorities receive at 
the close of each semester one-fourth of the amount of salary paid out. 
The schools of the city receive from the municipal school budget what- 
ever is necessary to cover the expenses of elementary schools beyond 
the amount of the governmental subsidy and such other funds as have 
been turned in from other sources. : ; 
For more detailed account as to teachers, finances, supervision, etc., 
see under appropriate heads below. 
Rural schools.—The law of June 26, 1889, as it applies to rural schools 
is as follows: Each commune is to have a sufficient number for the — 
education of all children between 7 and 14 years of age. The list pre- 
pared annually to contain the names’ of all children between 6 and 
15 years of age in each school circle, and. whether they belong to pub- 
lic or private schools. Annexed to these elementary communal schools 
are one or more continuation schools for children between 14 and 18 
years of age, the special aim of these schools being, as the name in- 
dicates, to consolidate and enlarge upon the instruction given in the 
elementary grades. Each commune is to be divided into school dis- 
tricts, and each of these districts is to have an elementary school of 
two divisions, #. ¢., first or lower division for pupils of 7 to 10 years of © 
age, and a second division for children from 10 to 14 years. If the par- 
ents reside at too great a distance from each other, this lower division 
may again be subdivided, or there may be an annexation to the schools” 
of other districts, if it is more convenient for small children. Such 
subdivision or annexation is to be referred by the school beard to the 
administration of the commune, and its decision again communicated 
-to the board of higher inspection and,to the school board which refers 
it to the minister of education. The separate classes of these divisions 
are not to have more than 35 pupils, or at the most 45 pupils. If there 
are fewer than 35 pupils in the school a consolidation of divisions may 
be made, Y 
The length of school year for each division is 12 weeks, but, if the 
       
-P-A-G-E-512
      484 “EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90: 
school authorities so decide, this may be extended to 15 weeks. The 
. number of hours of study each week is 36 for the higher division and 
30 for the little folks. If the school has fewer than 35 pupils there. 
may be a consolidation of the two divisions during 6 weeks, and a 
separation for 6 weeks schooling, or there may be a reduction to 10 
weeks of school for the two divisions taught separately. If there are 
only 20 pupils they may be taught together. If there are only 12 
pupils, 9 weeks a year may be the maximum of instruction. Special 
classes may be formed for backward children, the parents or guardians 
to pay for such instruction, the school board to see that such children 
-are withdrawn from the public schools if they are not in condition to 
benefit by the instruction given them. Optional courses, which are not 
_to exceed weeks a year for each class, may be formed to carry on & 
desired course of elementary studies, Continuation schools formed in 
@ commune, or in one or more rural communes united together, may be 
divided into one or more classes. Special regulations govern these 
schools. All children of the commune have the right to gratuitous in- 
struction during a seven-year period, unless they are exempt by reason 
of some infirmity or of the pernicious influence, which, if incorrigible, 
they may exert over other children. In such a case schools must be 
established for them where they will not affect the moral character of 
other children. Absence, unless for good and sufficient reason, causes 
- reprimand, a note to the parents; and further neglect, a fine of 
from 1 to 25 crowns (26.8 cents to $6.70), The employers of children 
engaged in industrial pursuits are to see that they have the proper 
schooling or else pay a fine which may amount to $26.80. In case of 
poverty of the parents the sehool board may furnish text-books and 
even clothing to children so that they can have school privileges. 
Any person desiring to open a private school for children under 15 
years of age will be fined 50 crowns ($13.40) if he does so without in- 
forming the authorities. If the person is not of high moral character 
the school board may forbid his keeping a private school. If the chil- 
dren are kept in such school the parents may be notified to withdraw 
them, or the school board may send them to the public schools. 
If the information desired by the school board of the heads of such 
private schools is not forthcoming, a fine of from 5 to 25 crowns ($1.34 
to $6.70) may be demanded in weekly payments. 
No religious text-books can be employed other than those authorized 
by the King. Other text-books can only be employed if they contain 
nothing contrary to the laws or the religion of the state. Before the 
school board can take any actiop relative to the introduction of a text- 
book the superintendents should be consulted. If higher tribunals have 
to be called upon in regard to the use of text-books, the board of higher 
inspection or superintendents can prevent their use until the matter is 
decided. Instruction must be given in the Norwegian language. In 
the diocese of Tromsée the Lap and Finnish tongues may be employed
-P-A-G-E-513
  THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM OF NORWAY. 485 
as auxiliaries. The text-books of those languages may also be employed 
side by side with the Norwegian text-books. If the school board de- 
cides that corporal punishment is allowable, it can only take place in 
, the presence of a member of the committee of inspection, and never 
upon “girls” ovér 10 years of age. It may be stated here that more 
stress is laid upon the matter of corporal punishment in Norway than 
in the other Scandinavian divisions. For instance, in 1882, among the 
instructions for teachers laid down by the diocesan board was this one: 
If any child-shows a lack of respect for his teacher, or is obstinate in 
demeanor, he may receive corporal punishment, but this can only take 
place by consent of the principal of the school, and must not result in 
injury to the pupil. The proprieties must also be observed in said. 
punishment. When a girl above the fourth class deserves punishment 
she must not be struck by one of the masters, but by a female teacher, 
in the presence of and with the consent of the directress of the school. 
Each commune has a school board to watch over the interests of the 
elementary and continuation schools. There is also a committee of in- 
spection,which reports to the school board as to discipline, absenteeism, 
the whereabouts of ambulatory schools, etc. The bishop and dean 
have religious instruction in charge. A superintendent has general 
oversight of the county schools and he participates in the meetings of 
the school boards and in the discussions of school affairs by the com- 
munal authorities. i 
Every public functionary is expected to aid the school board, the 
school administration of the department, and the supervisors or board 
of higher inspection, 
For the maintenance of schools. a commune may be divided into 
several school communes and the obligations and expenditures of ele- 
mentary schools shall be at the charge of the school commune. 
If a commune is made up of several parishes, the King is to arrange 
as to the part which the ecclesiastical functionaries are to take in school 
affairs. : 
The affairs of rural districts which have no municipal council and 
which, as far as school affairs are concerned, are united to a parish or 
to a town, can be regulated by the minister of education until the King 
decides otherwise. 
If any part of a commune, on account of some special conditions, the 
density of population, etc., may be considered a town, then if the com- 
munal administration demand it, the elementary schools may be organ- 
ized wholly or in part according to the regulations for city schools. 
Summarized, the new elementary school law includes two distinct 
laws, that for the country and that for the city. Twelve weeks a year 
is the duration for country schools, which is equal to the vacations in 
city schools, although these schools may be kept open fifteen weeks if 
the communal authorities so decide. The city schools have three divi- 
sions, the country schools two; so that the same teacher, who is 
 
-P-A-G-E-514
          A86 EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
required by law to teach twenty-four weeks a year, may have charge of 
the two divisions. In the rural schools 36 hours weekly instruction is _ 
given in the highest, 30 hours. in the lowest division. In cities the 
maximum for all divisions is 24 hours, but the municipal authorities 
ean reduce this to 18 if they choose, so that every effort is made not to 
overwork the children. The legal maximum of children varies in differ- 
ent schools, but it averages 40 to 50 children in each division in cities, 
and 35 to 45 in country schools. The course of instruction is more 
extensive in city schools, and it may be observed that reading, being 
_ an acknowledged fundamental, is not included in the programme of 
studies; that the concentric method of developing the same study pro- 
gressively in each course is not de rigueur, natural history, drawing, and 
geometry being found only in the second division, civic instruction 
in the third division, and physical sciences not at all. The programme 
for rural schools is less extensive, and seems to indicate that the chil- 
dren of rural districts are-naturally less precocious, and slower in in- 
- tellectual development than city children. History and geography are 
placed before the ten-year-old child; geometry does not appear; phys- 
ical exercise, manual training, and drawing are optional only, so that 
there is a natural deference to the needs of agricultural districts. Con- 
tinuation schools exist in the country, higher primaries in the cities. 
Instruction is free to all between 6 and 15 years of age in both city and 
rural schools. The school authorities comprise a school board and 
school council in each city and commune, in the cities composed (1) of 
at least one pastor and not more than three, designated by the bishop; 
(2) of a member of the municipal council, (3) and as many members as 
the municipal authorities decide. The council comprises all teachers of 
the elementary schools. In the rural districts a teacher, man or woman, 
appointed by his colleagues, holds place for two years in the council. 
The school board regulates the plan of study, time tables, etc., defer- 
ring all school affairs, however, to a higher council. The school board 
appoints the teachers, if approved by the higher council. The law does 
not state as to limit of salaries, but leaves that to the local authorities. 
This is found already to be a questionable method. But the law insists 
that each commune shall give at least to one teacher a complete position, 
that is, with lodgings for a family and land for two cows and a garden. 
The law isimperative as to religious instruction, inasmuch as it defines 
the school as a place where a Christian education must be given and 
that permanent place for teachers be given only to those who profess 
the Evangelical Lutheran faith. 
STATISTICS. > 
The system of public and private schools has.been clearly defined, 
but before proceeding to give figures it may be well to state that there 
‘are elementary, grammar (Middleskole), high schools, normal schools, 
Latin and Real-schools, the university, and special schools. Under the 
/

higher grades come those which give a more extended education than 
the elementary grades, and which lead to the university or to practical 
life, most of them being boys’ schools, although there are higher grades 
for both sexes and for girls alone. There are tuition fees required in 
secondary schools. The special schools are those which cover instruc- 
tion in agriculture, nautical schools educating officers for the com- 
mercial marine, private maritime schools, military and naval colleges, 
and a school for civil engineers. 
~ The total population for the year 1880 is stated to be 1,913,000. The 
children of school age at that date numbered 211,709, but an inerease _— 
in that number is noted in 1888, the year under discussion in this pre- 
sentation, when 222,317 pupils of school age were reported. Thenum- 
ber of suis enrolled in the stationary schools, Faste-skoler, was 205,825; 
in the ambulatory schools, Omgang skoler, the figures are not ee 
* The per cent of population in the stationary schools is about 10. 
Lack of figures forbids computation for all elementary schools, but the” 
statement that there is no illiteracy in Norway seems not far from the 
truth. 
Elementary pupils and teachers.—The number of school circles, skol- 
kredse, each one of which is required by law to have an elementary 
school, was 6,282. The male teachers, Laerere, employed in this grade 
numbered 3,477; the women, Laererinder, 368. 
In city schools 72,922 pupils (37,052 boys, 35,870 girls) were reported 
in 1888 in the ordinary grades of schools. 
The number of communal schools for boys.and girls was 74; pupils, ~ 
5,313. Of these schools 57 were of a private character, 24 of them 
being mixed schools, with 1,188 pupils. 
Secondary schools, called Offentlige hoiere almueskoler, kommunale mid- 
delskoler og private hiiere skoler, include the Latin gymnasiet, Real- 
gymnasiet, and MiddelsKoler. They number 63, with 10,481 students 
in 1887. These schools are again subdivided into 17 public, 36 com- 
munal, and 10 private schools; of these secondary grades 20 have a _ 
higher department containing a classical or mathematical line or both 
combined; 15 are public schools, 1 a communal school, and 4 private 
schools. iano the secondary schools are 17 mixed. schools; there 
are also 28 secondary schools for girls only, 7 communal and 21 privates 
A normal school is established in each one of the six dioceses into 
which the kingdom is divided. The number of pupils “in these six - 
schools preparing for teachers’ positions in the year 1888-89 was 346— 
of these 316 from rural districts, 30 from cities.. One hundred and sixty 
pupils had followed the course during two years, 17-during one year. 
Higher education.—The university at Christiania reported 1,620 stu- 
deuts in 1889. Statistics of special schools are not presented in the 
“Beretning om Skolevesenets Tilstand for Aaret, 1888,” from which 
these statistics are taken, but among them may be classed preparatory 
schools for industrial arts, which are of Danish origin and became a

fixture of the country in 1864. The state furnishes them an annual 
subsidy of $17,688, which is reimbursed in part by the contributions in 
the different communities. It also gives an annual sum of $7,524 for 
_ industrial scheols and manual training. There are also technical eve- 
ning schools at Drammen, Skien, Fredrikstad, Christiansand, Stavanger, 
and Trondjhem, which have an annual state subsidy of $5,360. In 
the industrial region of the Fjord of Skien $1,072 is accorded by the 
state to instruct mechanical workmen, and $268 for teachers in tech- 
nical schools, so that they may have the pene of a trip for improve- 
ment in their specialty. 
Length of school year.—By law twelve weeks annually in rural dis- 
tricts. There are schools, however, which have even a shorter term. 
In city schools a longer term.is found. Each week has six days of school 
and each day six hours, except Saturday, when the school is closed the 
half day. * 
School age.—The school age, according to law, is from the seventh 
year in the towns, from the eighth in rural districts, to the date of con- 
firmation, which is usually the fifteenth year. 
FINANCE, 
Income.—The income for schools is derived from governmental, county, 
municipal, and district funds. The school funds are made up from the 
interest of actual or eventual school funds, the public school funds voted 
- by the Storthing, voluntary gifts, fines, and amounts raised by the 
county and municipalities. Hach county or amt (there are twenty such 
administrative districts) is allowed from the governmental funds double 
the sum raised by taxation in that subdivision of the kingdom. If a 
county assesses on its estates an average school tax of 14 skillings 
(about 1 cent) for each inhabitant of that section it is entitled to double 
that amount from the state. The greater part of the income for public 
schools is raised, however, by a tax levied in each district—each munic- 
ipal district forming a school district with a school fund common to 
the circles or kreds into which the district. is divided. Nearly every 
school district has from twelve to fourteen such circles, while all the 
school districts belonging to the same province form together a higher 
school district and havea common fund for the use of schools. The 
school taxes are assessed in proportion to the amounts owned by the 
taxpayers; no person is exempt from taxation, and in order to enforce 
regular attendance of pupils the parent or guardian, if no valid excuse 
for nonattendance of children is given, is fined by the school committee 
from 24 skillings to 5 specie dollars (about 22 cents to $5.30). Such 
was the financial basis for carrying on the school system to date of 
June, 1889. The law passed on that day seems to leave financial mat- 
ters somewhat in statu quo, but the principal features are noted here. 
They read as follows: Each county or amt of Norway ought to have a 
school budget supplied by funds voted from the county budget and by
-P-A-G-E-517
THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM OF NORWAY. ~ 489 
a subsidy from the treasury on the following basis: If the general — 
council yotes for the school budget of the amt an amount equivalent 
to at least 8 dre (14 cents) for each inhabitant of the rural districts, 
the school budget would be entitled to a sum from the state funds equal 
toathird of the amount voted, and a fourth from the Tromsée and Fin- 
mark districts if the-sum voted did not exceed 12 dre (about 8 cents)” 
for each inhabitant. If, however, the county voted in excess of this 
amount the school budget would be increased double the amount from 
the state funds and treble in Tromsée and Finmark, if the Storthing 
voted the necessary funds. 
From the school budget is to be paid, by the vote of the general 
council, (1) the pensions accruing to teachers after five or ten years’ serv- 
iee, funds being furnished for said purpose by a tax which may reach 
12 dre (3 cents) for each inhabitant; (2) the expenditures of administering 
the schools of the county, including the salary of a school inspector; 
(3) the subsidy for the building of schoolhouses with or withoutlodgings 
for the teacher, anda contribution for the purchase of land for the teacher, 
or the equivalent thereof; (4) the subsidy for school material; (5) sub- 
sidy for expenditures in communes when the means are lacking; (6) 
subsidy for sickness of substitute teachers; (7) subsidy for continuation 
schools, each commune haying the right to reimburse itself for three- 
fourths of the expenses (school buildings and material not included) of 
one or more continuation schools carried on for two months; (8) subsidy 
for schools of manual training. 
The state subsidies for teachers’ salaries amount in each commune to 
a quarter of the salary paid (pension indemnity included); the commune 
to receive such subsidy at the close of each semester; this subsidy 
must not exceed 6 crowns ($1.60) a week for each school of the second 
division, and 4 crowns ($1.17) for the lower grade primaries. If, how- 
ever, the Storthing has voted the necessary funds, this state subsidy 
ean be increased to one-third of the salary paid, if the higher couneil     
so recommend, in the communes which have extra expenses entailed . 
upon them;. thesubsidy not to exceed 8 crowns ($2.14) a week for the 
highest division and 6 crowns ($1.60) for the lowest division. Pensions 
will be paid out of the communal funds, and the commune is required 
to pay all expenses of elementary and continuation schools of the com- 
mune in addition to this state subsidy. Expenditures for construction 
and repairs of school buildings, also for lighting, heating, moving of 
school material, janitor service, and teachers’ traveling expenses for 
school purposes, if the school authorities so decide, may be chargeable 
as a whole or in part to the school district or circles of the commune. If 
the taxation is unequal in the districts the communal authorities ought 
to equalize it as much as possible, either by contributions or by funds 
granted by the commune. If the school is an ambulatory one those 
persons who have proper habitations for the holding, of such school 
are required to keep it at least three weeks each year and at least one 
 
-P-A-G-E-518
          490 é EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90, 
week each time, the commune or administrative authorities to reim- 
burse them for such usage. The refusal-of such persons will cause the 
exaction of a fine of 8 crowns ($2.14), and another place will be selected 
at-once by the communal authorities. 
If the communal administPation so. decides, the expenditures of ele- 
mentary schools for children of the workmen may be paid, if they are 
willing to do so, by the proprietors of manufactories and industrial 
establishments which employ more than thirty or not less than twenty 
workmen. Other children may be admitted to these schools, but at 
the expense of the communal authorities, and if the schools haye not 
been carried on for a year by the persons in charge of such industries, 
the communal authorities are required to see that schooling i is furnished 
-by the proper authorities. 
If a school circle constitutes a separate district of the commune the 
expenditures ordinarily belonging to the commune will be charged to 
-the circle and it, in its turn, will be oad from the expenses ordi- 
narily oraeae to it. 
Hupenditure—The amounts expended for school purposes by state 
and local authorities may be best understood by the following statisti- 
eal presentation for the year 1888. It may be stated, however, that 
the amounts voted by the municipal authorities for the benefit of the 
county school fund are expended as follows: (1) Supplement to teach- 
ers’ salaries; (2) contributions to secondary schools and to work 
schools; (3) for the construction of school buildings with or without 
lodging for the teachers and for ground allotted to teachers; (4) for 
the support of schools in four parishes; (5) supplementary fund to 
teachers for instructing pupil teachers. The state does not give finan- 
cial aid to city schools, as they are, by law of July 12, 1848, in charge of 
the municipality.

SUPERVISION AND ADMINISTRATION. 
The administration of educational affairs in Norway is left, as far as 
the highest supervision is concerned, in about the position that it was ~ 
before the promulgation of the new law. _ The immediate superintend- 
‘ence devolves now more upon local school boards than upon rectors, 
bishops, and other dignitaries. Prior to 1888, the date for which statis- 
tics are presented, supervision was as follows: 
The highest school authority of the Kingdom was the Depart- 
ment of Ecclesiastical Affairs and Education, the reports of which 
are furnished to the King and legislative body, i. ¢., the Storthing, 
every third year. The chief officer of the educational division of the 
department has supervision of the university and of higher educa- 
tional institutions, such as the classical and Real schools and the 
higher burgher schools, The normal schools are also under charge 
of this department and their teachers are appointed by the King 
The department exercises general supervision over all schools of 
Norway, but with local officers in direct charge, The elementary 
schools come under the charge of the diocesan board in each of the 
six dioceses into which the kingdom is divided. Attached to this 
board, which is composed of the chief executive officer of the county 
and of the bishop of the diocese, is a school inspector, one for each dio- 
cese, whose diity it is to travel through the diocese and examine mi- 
nutely into the condition of the common schools. These six ecclesias- 
tical divisions were again subdivided into seventy-seven deaneries, the 
heads of which reported to the diocesan directors, and were invested 
with the higher inspection of schools and the control of school commit- 
tees. The communal authorities have immediate charge of the schools 
of the commune and school district; but while the communal officers 
look after the externals the bishop and pastor, or clergyman, watch 
most carefully over the inner workings of the school. The ordinary 
school district has the same limits as the municipal district. The gov- 
erning power consists of two codperative boards, the school committee 
as the administrative board, the municipal council voting the necessary

funds. The school committee had fcr its members the pastor of the 
parish as‘chairman, one of the teachers of the district (elected by his 
colleagues), the chairman of the r-unicipal council, and other members 
of the council, if it so decided. The duties of this committee were 
manifold, They inspected the@chools, examined as to attendance, condi- 
tion of buildings and furnishings, prepared the annual school budget to 
lay before the municipal council, and at the close of each year reported 
to the diocesan authorities as to the condition of schools in their respec- 
tive districts. The city or town schools were and are under the imme- 
diate authority of the municipal council, and in the larger cities an 
inspector is installed. : 
The school committee may also appoint one or more of the residents 
of the district to look after the regular attendance of pupils, and the 
clerical member of the committee is expected to observe that order 
and diligence are maintained in the schools, and that a christian spirit 
is inculeated. 
City schools.—According to the law of June 26, 1889, the following 
is the arrangement for the administration of city schools: Hach town 
is required to have a school board which is composed (1) of one or 
more clergymen of the parish, the limit being three, the bishop of the 
~ diocese choosing those whom he wishes to have serve for a two years’ 
period; (2) of a member of the municipal council chosen by the council 
at the commencement of each year; (3) of as many members, elected by 
the municipal administration, as it may consider advisable, these mem- 
bers being subject to the law of January, 1837, relative to municipal 
councils, as far as length of service and reappointment are concerned. 
The members of the school board choose from their own numbers a 
president and vice-president, who are to serve for a one year’s period. 
A member of the magistracy and the presiding officer of the school 
council take part at the meetings of the school board as consulting 
members. The members of the school board who are not Protestants 
ean not participate in the deliberations relative to religious instruction. 
The duties of the school board! are to look out for the interests of the 
schools and forthe children whoarenotinschool. Theschool board holds 
meetings once a month and as much oftener as is necessary. It prepares 
the plan of studies and arranges the hours of work. It informs the mag- 
istracy, annually, of the funds required for the managementof theschools. 
Ifthe funds suffice, an inspector of elementary schools is to be appointed, 
and his duties are to be indicated by the board. ‘The school board organ- 
izes a committee of inspection for each elementary school or for each 
group of schools inthesamebuilding. Thiscommitteeis composed: (1) of 
a member chosen by the school board; (2) an ecclesiastic or clergyman 
appointed for a two year period by the bishop; (3) three members cho- 
sen by the parents of the children frequenting the school. One of the 
members acts as presiding officer of the committee. The committee is

required to keep constant watch over the school under its charge, and 
to give the school board any information desired. In addition the 
school committee. may havea certain part in the distribution of the 
school funds, if the municipal authorities agree to it. The school board 
reports annually to the higher council-imregard to the condition of 
schools, and every five years, oftenerif the municipal authorities require 
it, a report on elementary schools must be published. 
The elementary teachers, male and female, of the city or town form 
a school council, its object being to discuss the affairs of the schools 
in common. If there is a school inspector he takes part in the coun- 
cil and presides over it, if not, the school board signifies which mem- 
ber of the teaching force shall preside. If the teachers of the town 
number more than sixty, the school board decides whether it is advisa- 
ble to have a school committee composed of others than the princi- 
pals of the schools to join with the ‘school council in the management 
of school affairs. The term of office of such members is two years, 
with change of half the number each year, the first time by ballot; 
a reélection is allowable, and acceptance is expected. The school 
board detides whether such a council is necessary, and whether an in- 
spector or school director is to preside over the meetings. The members 
of the school council are to meet whenever the presiding officer re- 
quests, or oftener, if the members themselves decide that it is neces- 
sary for them to do so. No decision of the council is of value unless 
half of the members are present. If there is a division, the presiding 
officer’s vote counts as two. The school council must consult with the 
school board in regard to the general organization of primary schools, 
the general regulations for order and discipline, text-books, and plan ~ 
of studies. 3 
The duties of the school superintendents are thus defined. The ac- 
tual supervisor or superintendent of elementary schools ought, each 
in his district, to act as a higher inspector, to see that the school laws 
are carried out. The King decides, with the approbation of the Stor- 
thing, how these officials of higher inspection are to be chosen. The 
bishop and the dean of the clergymen watch over the inspection of re- 
ligious instruction. These superintendents of elementary instruction 
are supposed to travel about and reside in the different towns of the 
district, so as to keep familiar with methods employed and take part 
in the school councils, while in regard to religious matters they are to 
consult the bishop. The bishop and supervisors are authorized to par- 
ticipate in discussions of the school board and the municipal council! in 
regard to school affairs, but their vote is not’ counted. This board of 
inspection is required to furnish an annual report each year to the 
minister of education. 
Rural schools.—For the administering of school affairs in rural dis- 
tricts the arrangement differs from that of city schools, as will be seen. 
   
-P-A-G-E-522
      494 "  BDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. © 
Each commune must have a school board, which is to be composed of: 
(1) a clergyman or curate chosen by the bishop; (2) the president of 
the municipal council; (3) a regular teacher elected for two years by 
the teachers, both male and female, at a meeting presided over by the 
president of the school board; (4) as many members elected*by the 
communal administrative officers as they desire, term of service of offi- 
cers, reélection, etc., being decreed by law of January 14, 1837; (5) the 
proprietor of a manufactory or other industry who pays for a school for 
the children of his workmen. ‘The members of the school board who 
are not professing Christians will not be allowed to participate in the 
discussions appertaining to religious instruction. The clergymen of 
the parish are authorized to take charge of the religious instruction in 
the elementary grades. 
The duties of the school board are to watch over all the interests of 
the elementary and continuation schools; to see that children who do 
not attend school receive elementary instruction; to prepare the school 
regulations and plan of studies and to arrange the hours of recitations; 
to present an estimate of the school funds necessary; to organize for 
each school circle or district a committee of inspection, which shall be 
composed of one member elected by the school board and of three mem- 
bers chosen in a meeting of ‘district personages. This committee is to 
_ Keep constant watch over the schools, and to keep the school board in- 
formed as to the attendance, absenteeism, discipline, whereabouts of 
ambulatory schools, ete. The committee may also suggest as to school 
funds, ete. f 
The meeting which elects the school committee is to be composed of 
all taxpayers who are at least 25 years of age, the parents of school 
children, etc. When voting for school expenses only those who pay 
are allowed to vote. The meetings may be called when the school board 
desires or when at least five heads of families request it. 
The school board must report in regard to the schools annually to 
the higher council of inspection, and must publish a report every awe 
years if the communal authorities so require. 
The school board is to obtain information in regard to the instruction 
~ given children who do not attend the public schools, and, if such in- 
straction is not what it should be, the children can be required to pass 
an examination before the teachers of the elementary schools, if the 
parents desire it. Singing, drawing, gymnastics and manual training 
are not included in such examinations, however. The school-board is 
to see that backward children have suitable instruction in special 
schools arranged for that purpose, and that children of indigent parents 
receive whatever material aid is required so that they may attend 
school. The school fund not being sufficient for such purpose, the pub- 
lic charitable organizations may be called upon, as also in ease children 
are incorrigible, so that they, too, may receive school privileges where 
they will not demoralize the better class of children,

The superintendent or supervisor of elementary instruction ought, — 
each in his district, to see that the laws are carried out; in case of his - 
demise or withdrawal from office the King will decide, with the consent 
of the Storthing, how such higher inspection is to be carried out. The 
bisl®p and dean of the clergymen have religious instruction in charge. - 
The superintendents are expected to visit the schools of other localities — 
and observe how they are earried on and to assist the school board and. 
teachers by suggestions, counsel, etc. Before deciding any matter ap- 
pertaining to religious instruction the bishop’s advice should be taken. 
The superintendent and bishop are authorized to participate in the meet-

communal authorities. The superintendent also assists at the delibera- 
tions of the general council and of the departmental school administra-

TRAINING OF TEACHERS.) 
In Norway the teachers’ calling is considered a high one and the 
teachers are generally esteemed. To thoroughly educate them for 
such a profession the Norwegian Government has arranged for the 
training of teachers for elementary schools in the six normal schools, 
one for each diocese of the kingdom. These schools, situated at As- 
ker, Hamar, Kristiansand, Stordéen, Klaebu, and Tromsée, are under 
governmental supervision, and each normal has a practice school at- 
tached to it, where the pupils can put the theoretical part of their edu- 
eation into practice. . There is also a class of minor training schools 
for teachers with studies similar to the higher elementary schools; 
these are under the supervision of the board of the diocese and are 
under inspection of the dean and pastor of the parish, while the state 
normals come under the head of seminaries; these latter institutions 
are the so-called Lererskoler, which are either attached to the higher 
elementary grades or become the upper class of the general elementary 
school. There are comparatively few state normal schools for women, 
-a8 female teachers are not yet generally employed in the schools, but _ 
there have been for several years private normals for the prepara-

here presented. The new law of 1889, as it applies to teachers in city and rural 
schools, differs in many particulars. Such changes are noted a few lines below. 
‘

tion of women for the teaching force, and a normal under Government 
auspices was established for this sex in 1890, as the Norwegians real- 
ize the progressive movements of the times and have had under discus- 
sion for some time the need of such nermals for women. 
The normals proper received 102,970 crowns ($27,661) in 1883; Of this 
amount the state gave 98,706 crowns ($25,453). The amount expended 
for the instruction of teachers in the other schools was 14,308 crowns 
($3,840). The number of students in the six normal schools mentioned 
above was 346; of these 316 were from the rural districts, 30 from the 
cities, and 99 from other dioceses; 132 had free instruction and 59 had 
scholarships. The teachers were reported as 15 with acadenfic in- 
struction and“12 with normal training. The directors and teachers of 
these normals are appointed by the King, while the teachers of the 
minor normals are appointed by the diocesan board. 
Teachers in the public schools are presumed to have passed an ex- 
amination either in the normal schools or the equivalent of the same 
elsewhere. 
The course in the normals comprises religion, a thorough knowledge 
of the native tongue, arithmetic, music, geography, history, natural 
sciences, penmanship, drawing, and gymnastics; there is a model 
school in connection with each. 
As a general rule, only those teachers who have passed an examina- 
tion at these higher seminaries or normal schools receive positions in 
the common public schools. 
If among the candidates who are appointed by the diocesan authori- 
ties, on recommendation of the local school board, there are no persons 
who have submitted to such examination, then the effort is made to 
obtain as teacher one who has followed the lower course in a secondary 
school and had a year’s practice as pupil teacher. Assistant teachers 
and teachers of infant schools receive their appointment directly from 
the local school board. Women teachers are usually placed in charge 
of the lower grades in elementary schools or in charge of the girls’ 
classes in mixed schools, and under the new law female teachers may 
be appointed as head mistresses in the public schools, although the 
salaries may vary from those of male teachers in like position. 
The date of the examination of women teachers for rural schools is 
usually arranged by the King, as is also the salary allotted to them. 
The salaries of teachers depend upon the district authorities, but it 
is really the provincial council or county board which fixes the mini- 
mum according to the number of weeks which school is kept open. The 
instructors in rural districts also receive a state subsidy which was 
definitely fixed in 1879 at about 2 crowns (53.6 cents) for each week of 
instruction given, the amount to go to such teachers as receive more 
than 8 crowns ($2.14) a week from the communal authorities. 
‘Both in city and rural districts a pension is accorded to teachers after 
certain length of service. In 1889 it was stated that more than two- 
  Se

  ‘THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM OF NORWAY. - AST 
thirds of the rural school teachers received annuities for either five or 
ten years’ service, while many teachers had both lodging and ground 
placed at their disposal by the authorities. 
The law of 1889 deals with this division of the subject and places 
the teachers’ status much more clearly before the reader, but it places 
the appointment of teachers in the power of local boards, and this has 
already caused much adverse comment. The training, examination, 
salary, and pensioning of instructors in city schools are given as fol- 
lows: : 
City schools—Teachers can only be employed in elementary grades 
of city or town schools if they speak the language of the country and 
are members of the established church of Norway. In order to obtain 
a permanent place they must be at least 20 years of age, must have 
passed the graduating examination from a normal school or one cor- 
responding to the examination required for entrance into the univer- 
sity.. In addition there are certain requisites defined by the constitu- 
tion. Exceptions to such preparation of teachers are made if the can- 
didate for a teacher’s position can certify that he has been connected 
with either a public or private school as teacher. 
Teachers are appointed by the school board, subject to the decision 
of the higher council. If the candidate is not satisfactory to the higher 
council the matter may be referred to the municipal authorities, who, 
siding with the higher council, must notify the school board to appoint 
the candidate preferred by that council. The teachers may be em- 
ployed provisionally at first, the time not to extend over a year; if the 
teacher fulfills all conditions he may receive a permanent appointment; 
if not, the appointment may be revoked after three months’ notice and 
another candidate may be,employed. In case of grave complications 
the teacher may be suspended from his functions, but the pay will go 
on until the investigation of the affair by the school authorities. 
The teachers themselves form a school council, with the object of 
discussing school affairs; the school inspector presides, or, if not, the 
school board appoints a presiding officer from among the teachers, 
The teacher who is charged with the duties of inspector may request 
to be relieved of a certain number of hours of instruction. Auxiliary 
teachers may be employed for singing, manual training, drawing, and 
arrangements may be made to give instruction by the hour if there 
does not seem to be a necessity for a person to fill a permanent position. 
The teacher’s salary is arranged according to fixed rules elaborated 
by the school board and submitted to the municipal authorities by the 
advice of the higher council of inspection. The decision of the mu- 
nicipal authorities will be forwarded to the higher council, thence to the 
school board, and for final action to the municipal authorities again. 
The salaries are arranged in two groups, the minimum of the higher 
group to be equal to the maximum of the lower group. Two-thirds of 
those in permanent employ belong to the lower group. In proportion

        — 498 — EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
   to the total number, the number of female teachers employed should 
not be larger than that of the males in the higher group. The regula- 
tions fix the number of hours each week expected of a regular teacher, 
the minimum salary of each group, the time of payment, the years of 
service, etc. As to the matter of pay of auxiliary teachers and sub-~- 
stitutes it is to be decided by the municipal authorities. Each regular 
teacher of the lower group is entitled to increase of pay after serving 
the number of years required by law. In case of illness certain pay 
_ will be allowed. 5 
Rural schools.—As in the city schools, candidates for teachers’ posi- 
tions are required to be familiar with the language of the country, to 
be Protestants, to be 20 years of age, and to have a certificate showing 
that they hae passed the examination required by law. Such ecertifi- 
cate entitles them to a permanent place as teacher in a lower division, 
or to teach special branches in the second division of the elementary 
grades, for not more than 12 weeks, however. The prerequisites for 
a teacher’s position in the second or higher division are a normal- 
school diploma or proof of passing the examination required for the 
entrance to the university, and a few other proofs designated by law. 
The possession of such proof aceredits the teacher with a permanent 
place in any division of the elementary grades. When a vacancy 
oceurs the public is informed by the school board, and it is indicated 
whether a man or woman teacher is desired for such a position. The 
delays attendant upon the appointment are also placed before the 
public. The school board makes the appointment, but takes the advice 
of the committee of inspection of the district in regard to the candi- 
date, and before making a final decision the higher council of inspec- 
tion is to be consulted. If the board and council do not agree as to 
the candidate the communal administration is referred to, and if the 
administration and the higher council agree their candidate must be 
selected. A similar rule applies to the choice of the auxiliary teachers 
for special branches, and substitutes. Any persons oceupying such 
positions may be tried for a while in the positions leading te permanent 
‘appointments. If the teacher is to be expected to fill the functions of 
chorister the bishop. selects the teacher fer that position. x: 
Teachers of either sex who are not engaged permanently may have 
their services dispensed with after three months’ notice. If those hold- 
ing permanent appointments have failed in their duties or there is com- 
plaint in regard to professional or private conduet the appointment 
may be revoked by the school board in accord with the committee of 
inspection, and if the ease is especially aggravated the teachers can 
be relieved at once of their duties pending official action; but the salary 
is to continue until the matter has been thoroughly canvassed, The 
school board can-request all teachers of the commune to unite with it 
twice a year to discuss questions which may be of benefit to the schools. 
The higher council of inspection is to be notified in due season-of these 
reunions. a

      THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM OF NORWAY. * 499 
The duty of the teachers is, not only by their method of instruction, 
but in every way, to conform to the designated plan of studies, to keep 
up school discipline, to give the pupils under their charge a Christian. 
education, and to watch over the children both in and out of school. 
The regular teachers holding permanent positions are expected to 
teach 24 weeks each year in one or both divisions. Auxiliary teachers 
have charge of extra branches which cannot be undertaken by the 
teacher proper. Singing, gymnastics, drawing, and manual training 
may be taught by the hour. 
The general council of each county determines the minimum salary 
for permanent teachers. This minimum for the second division of the 
elementary grades is not to be less than 12 crowns ($3.21) each week, 
and for the lower division (for little folks) not less than 8Growns ($2.14) 
for 36 hours of teaching in the upper division, and 30 hours in the 
lower division. After five or ten years’ service in rural districts, or in _ 
the city, teachers are allowed certain additional emoluments, the 
amount being fixed by the school and municipal authorities. Hach 
eommune is to furnish at least one teacher with lodging suited to a 
‘family, and ground accompanying it, and this may be conceded to more 
than one teacher, or, if land is not to be procured, certain State or 
communal funds may be allowed him. 
According to the earlier laws, teachers who had attained the age of 
60 and served 30 years, also such as were incurably sick, were to re- 
ceive a pension equal to 75 per cent of their salary. Ifat the age of 
55 they had served 25 years, they would also receive a pension, but of 
less amount. The Government and the parishes contribute to the 
pension fund. In 1891, among other educational movements, a bill 
» which dealt with the subject of elementary teachers was laid before the 
Storthing. Its provisions were that every teacher who had reached hig 
sixtieth year, and had at least twenty-five years of service after his 
twenty-fifth year, should be entitled to a pension of 59 per cent of his 
salary. 
Teachers who have not less than 10 years of service will be granted 
retiring pensions, if recommended by their superior officers, and if their 
financial condition makes it needful. These pensions are to be voted 
as follows: 30 per cent of salary for 10 years’ service; 40 per cent for 20 
- years’ service; 50 per cent for 25 years; 60 per cent for 30 years and 
upwards. This is to be the maximum. 
The teachers are required to secure annuities of 10 per cent to their 
widdws, and 20 per cent in case of an increase of 50 per cent of the 
teacher’s salary before his forty-fifth year. ‘he power of settling a 
teacher’s pension, as well as the payment of it, is vested by the new bill 
in the local authorities. This special proviso seems to meet with gen- 
eral approval, as those authorities know much better than the Govern- 
‘ment or the Storthing what is most needed. The system of annuities is 
well adapted for lower grade publie officials. The officials who pay for 
   
-P-A-G-E-528
                500. : EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
their own pension must necessarily have higher fixed salaries, if their 
profession is not to suffer. If the system of self-pensioning is carried 
out, then all expenses of administration must be added, and the conse- 
quence is that this nlan remains the dearer of the two methods. 
COURSES OF STUDY. 
Elementary schools.—The law of May 16, 1860, states that the object 
of the common schools is to second the education of the family by in- 
structing children in the principles of Christian religion, and, by giving 
them such knowledge as each member of society should possess, cause 
them to advance in general knowledge as far as compatible with cir- 
‘ewmstances. The beginnings of such education covered the three R’s 
and selections from a reading book published by the Government, 
which selections related to history, geography, and a knowledge of 
nature and the Christian religion according to the tenets of the estab- 
lished Lutheran Church. In the more advanced classes, for pupils about 
12 years of ago, more complete instruction in these branches was given, 
with the addition of geography, history, natural history, drawing and _ 
geometry, mathematics, political economy, and one foreign language. 
Whenever the school committee allowed it, gymnastic and military 
exercises were taught to the boys, and annually there was a military 
parade. 
According to the new law the Christian character of the school is pre- 
‘served, the children of Dissenters only being exempted from enforeed 
Peleus instruction, more stress is laid upon secular subjects; manual 
training, Pyiastios, and military exercises appear more prominently 
in the course. 
Oty schools—The course of study in elementary divisions, according 
to law of June 26, 1889, is as follows: Lowest division, religious instruc- 
tion, Norwegian language, history, geography, arithmetic, writing, 
singing, gymnastic exercises, manual training for, girls, and, if so 
ordered by the municipal authorities, also for boys. In the second di- 
vision, same studies as above, manual training for both boys and girls, 
natural history, geometry, and drawing. In the third or highest divi- 
sion, religious instruction, Norwegian language and history (including 
elementary studies in regard to national institutions), natural history 
(including elements of hygiene), arithmetic, and gymnastic exercises, 
with target practice. The school board, if requested by the parents, 
is at liberty to excuse pupils who are pacey acd or physically disabled, 
from certain studies, or from full hours of recitation, which hours are 
not to exceed 24 each week, unless there are Spedial studies, such as 
foreign languages, and then not to exceed 30 hours. Pupils who are 
Dissenters may also be excused from the religious exercises. 
A clergyman of the city is authorized to take charge of the religious 
instruction in elementary schools. The books to be used in religious 
exercises must be authorized by the King. The choice of text-books
-P-A-G-E-529

for other studies must be limited ‘to those which have nothing against 
the established religion or contrary to the laws of the State.' The de- 
cision of the school board in regard to books is to be approved by the 
higher council. If the higher council finds it necessary to appeal to 
the tribunals concerning the suppression of any books, it has the au- 
thority to interdict the use of the books until the matter is decided. 
The school law makes manual training obligatory im the second class 
in boys’ schools, age 11 to12 years. For older boys the authorities 
may decide whether it is requisite. In the rural schools it is taught 
whenever advisable. 
Rural schools.—The course of study in the lower division comprises 
religious instruction, Norwegian language, arithmetic, writing and 
singing, with oral instruction preparatory to entering the higher divi- 
sions. In the higher division the same studies, with the addition of 
geography, history, elements of instruction regarding national institu- 
tions, natural history and the elements of hygiene, manual training, 
physical exercises, including target practice. As in the city schools, 
backward children’ and those of feeble health may be exempted from 
following the full course, if the parents request it, and children of Dis- 
senters may omit the religious exercises. Special courses may be ar- 
ranged, if the communal authorities see fit, for children who are not 
able to take the full course, the expense of such courses to be defrayed 
by the parents or guardians. Optional courses may be attached to the’ 
higher division, but additional hours will be required for such instruc- 
tion, and no class must have more than 6 additional weeks a year for 
such purpose. The studies to be pursued are to be those of the elemen- 
tary grades or similar ones. The duration of the continuation schools 
may be from one to six months. 
In one of the city schools of Christiania, which had both free and-pay . 
pupils, a visitor! to the school observed that the religious exercises in- 
cluded the Old and New Testaments, Book of Psalms, Luther’s Catechism, 
and the History of the Reformation. In the Norwegian language the 
exercises served to develop’ thought and language. They included 
reading by the reading-writing method, composition, poetry, exercises in 
orthography and in caligraphy. In arithmetic the instruction consisted — 
of object lessons, counting desks and chairs, teaching rules of ten up to 
one hundred, division by tens, rule of five, mental calculation, moneys, 
weights and measures. The exercises in geography for the second and 
third classes consisted of general instruction, with study of maps. of 
Christiania, Norway, and Europe. National history was introduced in 
the third class; then there were gymnastic exercises and singing. Man- 
ual training was not obligatory for boys, but instruction was given in 
knitting, sewing, and in cutting paper according to dimensions speci- 
fied. In the fourth class the pay pupils had drawing and gymnastics. 
In the fifth, sixth, and seventh classes natural history and geometry

were added to the other studies, and the paying pupils had physics 
taught them. 
At one of the largest private schools in Christiania a conrse of in- 
struction in manual training for girls was given; this included carpen- 
try, turning, and wood carving. : 
A correspondent of the London Journal of Education in 1890, in re- 
ferring to the studies pursued, or to be pursued, in elementary schools 
of Norway, says: 
Sloyd instruction is still making progress in all our schools. In some intermediate 
schools the maximum marks given for this subject at the summer examinations are 
the same as those in the other subjects, but our capital (Christiania) takes here, asin 
most reforms, the lead. Its local board has just appointed a Sloyd inspector to have 
the supreme care of the Sloyd instruction in all the primary schools of the city. This 
official has a very good salary. It is to be hoped that the efforts of the Sloyd in- 
spector will give manual training additional importance in our schools. The munic- 
ipal council of Christiania has also formed a training school for educating Sloyd 
teachers. This school begins its courses with 24 pupils. In the primary schools of 
Christiania there are at present 16,294 children in 459 classes. In each class there are, 
accordingly, 35} pupils on an average. This number is considerably higher than 
what we think advisable, as 30 pupils in one class are esteemed to be the desirable 
maximum. English is the foreign language mostly spoken in Norway. It is also 
taught in all intermediate schools, and read by the majority of pupils in secondary 
schools and in many places in the primary continuation schools. Certain politicians 
and pedagogues recommend the making it a compulsory subject in the higher classes 
of the primary schools. One of the influential dailies (Verdens Ganz) writes as fol- 
lows on this subject: ‘English is already spoken-by nearly one-third of the popula- 
tien of the earth. If you wish to learn any foreign language there is no doubt it 
should be English. To master such a universal language is far better than a great 
deal of what school children torment themselves to learn, only to forget it later on, 
Instruction in English would be of far greater importance than courses for learning 
the Norwegian dialect, and the like stuff, and it is of greater value than Old Norse 
and all the dead classical languages put together. English gives you entrance into 
arich culture; it is of practical value in numberless circumstances, and is a mighty 
weapon in the struggle for life to every young man who has wholly mastered it.” 
This statement is given in full, as it shows that in the matter of 
elementary education, as well as that of secondary education, the gen- 
eral trend of educational movements in Norway is toward those branches 
which would naturally become a greater power in following any special 
pursuit in practical life. 
Intermediate and secondary grades.—in Norway there is between the 
people’s schools and gymnasia an intermediate grade of school, the six- 
class middle school, based on the law of June 1869, which has the aim of 
preparing for the Gymnasia and also giving a general education to those 
who are fitting for practical life. For entrance there is an examination, 
which is only permissible to children who are fully nine years of age. 
The course of instruction covers religion, mother tongue, history, geog- 
raphy, arithmetic, and writing; the second half year German, one term 
later natural sciences and drawing, a year later geometry. With the 
fourth year the pupil chooses whether he will follow the Latin or Eng- 
lish course, the former leading to the Gymnasia, the latter being equiva- 
Jent in part to the courses which lead to Real-schools, Real-gym- 
nasia, ete. French begins with the-fifth year, but it is an optional

braneh. The pupil who passes the graduation examination can enter 
the real classes or the Gymnasia. The first have a two-year course,which - 
covers such branches as are suited for practical life, such as bookkeep- 
ing and national economy. The studies are arranged in two groups, 
with or without modern languages. The pupil makes his choice of one 
of thetwo. The Gymnasia have two divisions, the Latin and Realgym- — 
nasia, the studies naturally leading from either one or the other of the 
divisions in the intermediate grades. The Realgymnasia have no Latin; 
the Latin gymnasia have English from the second year on, and then . 
only as an optional study. The course of study is similar to that of ~ 
- the German gymnasia. In examinations Greek and mathematics rank 
with the German gymnasia, while Latin is not carried on to such a 
high degree. German is not found in the Latin gymnasia, but is car- 
ried on for two years in the Realgymnasia, so that the pupils have 
seven and one-half years’ study of that language. The amount of 
mathematics in the Realgymnasia is similar to that of German gym- 
nasia; natural sciences are carried to a more advanced point; the 
modern languages are not studied to such an extent. The course in 
both Latin and Realgymnasia is of three years, the examen artium 
taking place at the end of that time. Those who pass are called, ac- 
NS 
cording to their studies, either Real or Latin students. The passing of - 
this examination admits to the university studies or to technical insti- 
tutes; still if the Latin student wants to enter the military school he 
has to pass a practical examination, which is not severe. 
If the Realgymnasist aims to study medicine, he has to pass an ex- 
amination in Latin with similar requirements to those expected of mid- - 
dle-school pupils, and not the Latin gymnasia graduation requirements. 
If he aims to study philology and theology, he must pass a verbal ex- 
amination in Latin and Greek, with similar requirements to the gradu- 
ation examination of Latin gymnasia. 
The secondary schools of Norway are organized so as to be free from 
any one sidedness, fitting as they do for either practical or professional 
life. The course of study employed in these schools has existed for 
twenty years in Norway, and it has been clearly demonstrated that two- 
thirds of the students from the middle schools pass through the Latin . 
gymnasia and one-third through the Realgymnasia. This may be ex- 
plained in part by the fact that the earlier Latin schools were changed 
into Latin gymnasia, without great cost. When'the circumstances 
were such that only one high-school course could be pursued, it was 
usually the Latin gymnasia which attracted the most pupils. The time 
tables for the Real gymmasia show the number of hours devoted to dif- 
ferent branches, viz:

         This was the course of study for many years in Norway, but in the 
matter of secondary schools, as well as of the more elementary grades, 
endeavors were made to improve upon the former courses and plans. 
By a decree of March 1, 1885, the law of 1869 was to be modified to this 
extent in the middle or intermediate grades and the Latin gymnasia. 
The course of study in middle schools, by decreee of March, 1885, is

the Real and three in the Latin division; in classes Iv, v, and vi Eng- 
lish is studied for five hours in the Real course, and Latin for seven 
hours in the Latin subdivision; in class rv of the Real course drawing 
is found for two hours, and in classes v and vi of the Latin course for 
one hour each. 
In classes v and vi, French is optional for two hours, while for some 
years natural sciences ranked as one hour study only in the fifth and 
sixth classes of Real divisions and was left blank in the Latin division. 
The hours of study in the Latin gymnasium by decree of March, 1885, 
were as follows:

But the time-table and studies adopted at that date do not seem to 
have entirely satisfied the educators of Norway; for, from time to time, 
the press of the country has chronicled discussions of the subject, and 
some of the most earnest debates in the Storthing have been in regard 
to secondary education, with especial discussions of the position of the = 
classics in high schools. A digest of the discussions is here given, as it aes 
shows the tendency of thought in Norway at the present day. Many 
of the speakers advised radical changes in the course of study of second- i 
ary schools. The late minister of education, Sverdrup, advocated the — 
theory that there is too much Latin and Greek taught, and that the eS 
path to higher educational attainment is by the pursuit of mere modern ‘ 
studies; while a former colleague of his, Hertzberg, of Christiania, took 
the opposite side in the discussion, by earnestly advocating the reten- 
tion of these branches because they have such firm root in general 
European culture since'time immemorial. Prof. Horst, of Tromsie, ad- 
vocated the suppression of Greek as the first step in reform, and he 
stated that the younger philologists agree that, unless a man is to fol- 
low a profession in which Latin and Greek are requisites, the better . 
course of study is one which tends to more general culture. Others who > 
have been teachers for many years took earnest part in the discussion 3 
and stated that they had reached similar conclusions, i. ¢., that knowl |. 
edge of the classics is not of much service in after life, but that a thor- 
ough knowledge of some more practical branches is requisite. Several © 
of the mempers of the Storthing deprecated too rapid changes, as 
liable to be classed as revolutionary movements, but they suggested 
the suppression of Greek and the leaving Latin as an optional study 
and the adopting of new regulations based upon Latin as an optional 
study only. : 
The outcome of the discussions going on from time to time is that a 
royal commission for the reform of secondary schools was appointed in 
1880, which consisted of seven members, one of whom is a professor 
of theology at the University of Christiania and the rest practical , 
schoolmen. Both the conservative and progressive elements were : 
represented, and it is conceded that the result of their deliberations 
will be excellent. According to the decision of the commission the ~— 
common school is to be a refining influence upon the masses, and in 
order that satisfaction be given it must in a measure define its own
-P-A-G-E-534

     limits. The best preparation for the higher schools is a well-grounded 
elementary education, instruction as far as possible to aid the individ- — : 
ual pupil to fellow his special bent. Suggestions were made in the 
pill, which received Royal approval on September 3, 1890, which would 
make the present third class of the intermediate grade the first class of 
the new middle school, and the first five years of the common schools 
would become the first and second division of preparatory grades for 
the higher schools. One of the commission intimated that at present 
the two lowest complete divisions of city schools are adapted to the 
reform movements in progress and that they ought already to be pre- 
-paratory divisions for the higher grades. The commission was unani- 
~ mous in stating that the middle schools have too many subjects of 
study and that there must be a greater concentration of instruction. 
Certain members proposed that the central point of study for’the gym- 
nasia should be seligion, the mother tongue, and history. In these 
grades there should be certain restrictions; physics should be taught 
with respect,to its importance for practical life, physiology taught in a 
manner to bring out the most important rules for health and hygiene. 
. Others proposed mathematics as a basis for practical instruction; Ger- 
man to be considered the most important language next to the mother 
tongue; the time for the study of the last mentioned to be increased. 
French might be omitted, but English or Latin must be kept in the 
course. According to a proposition made, the middle schools, from the 
third class on, should be separated into the Latin and English divisions, 
and the most desirable combination suggested was to have three years 
in Latin—i. ¢., two in the middle schools and one in the gymnasia—the 
special branches chosen in the middle schools to lead either to the com- 
mercial, technical, military, or naval schools. Discussions as to the 
study of Greek and Latin are noted above, the members differing as to 
the amount of ancient languages and as to their proper place in the 
school programme. 
There seemed, however, to be unanimity as to the time of instruc- 
tion, which should not exceed 6 hours daily, from 8} or 9 o’cloek till 2 
o'clock, and that recitations should not be longer than 45 minutes, 
although the first recitation might be 50 minutes. There should also be 
recesses of five, ten, or twenty minutes, and gymnastic movements and 
going into the fresh air were considered needful, so as to keep the chil- 
dren in a proper state of health. Coeducation was discussed, and it 
was considered that this uniting of boys and girls together in the same 
- school is a pedagogical problem worthy of study, but that the advance 
movements in this respect must be made by degrees, some of the mem- 
bers seeming to consider that five hours of study a day were all that 
the health of the girls would admit, while the boys should have six 
hours. But this statement seems to have been controverted by the 
statement made by two lady superintendents, who clearly intimate that 
there are some boys as well as girls who are physically weak, and that 
where the normal condition of health is found both sexes have equal

    mental development, and should, therefore, be treated alike in the mat- 
ter and length of study. Reference was made in the discussion to the 
comparatively unlimited freedom as regards the éducational system, in 
even the smallest communities of the different States in North America, 
to coeducation as practiced thére, and to its gaining ground in the 
public schools, and to the advisability of its establishment in Norway. 
Reference was made to the earlier periods when the greatest acade- 
mies of learning had possibly mere independence and. intelleetuality 
than at present. The members intimated that the city schools are in 
general a result of the pedagogical wisdom of the times, and are 
usually in good condition, as they receive the greater part of the money 
allotted by the State, consequently they ean be made to progress in the 
right direction, and the efforts for rural schools will come more gradu- 
ally. ‘ 
The suggestions made.by the commission give, as it were, the essence 
of the practical pedagogical progressive spirit, as shown in other coun- 
tries, and endeavors will be made in the future, as an outcome of the 
work of this commission, to bring about the most secure and the new- 
est school reforms, the paces being that of practical experience in Nor- 
way and elsewhere, the result a firm and natural development in the 
domain of education. .

Normal and university courses.—An epitome of the course of study in 
normal schools was presented under the heading “Teachers.” Itmay be 
noted here, however, that a plan of reform, suggested in 1884, was to mod- 
ify what was at that time calledan unsatisfactory course-for the normals. 
More space was to be given to the study of the mother tongue; the patois 
of the peasant, Landsmaal, was to be.placed upon an equal footing with 
- the Danish-Norwegian tongue; Old Norse was to be taught in order 
to make the study of the language of the present easier; English or 
German was to be added as an optional study; special importance 
was to be given to gymnastic and military exercises and manual train- 
ing. To what degree the general progressive movements have touched 
these schools for the training of teachers is not known. 
The organization of the university corresponds to the liberal ideas of
-P-A-G-E-537

‘the Norwegians. It has neither chancellor, vice-chancellor nor rector, 
‘and it is not necessary to have the doctor’s degree to obtain high posi- 
tion in the university. Its different faculties—viz, theology, law, med- 
icine, philosophy, and the sciences—have each a dean in charge. In — 
order to be admitted as a student it is necessary to have passed the 
examen artium. Most of the candidates for admission are from the 
gymnasia and realschools, and are supposed to have a certificate from- 
the Middelskoler. The examining board, which consists of university 
professors, distinguishes between the Classiske examen artium and the 
Real artiwm, the latter being sufiicient for those who wish to follow a 
course in mathematical, physical and natural sciences, while the former 
is required of those who wish to enter the other faculties. There are 
really five faculties, as the faculty of philosophy has two divisions—that 
of historical and philosophical sciences, and that of mathematical and 
natural sciences. The examination for entrance takes place in the 
latter part of July and first of August. The first semester is from the 
middle of January to the first half of May, the second semester from 
August 1 to end of November. Women are admitted to the univer- 
sity, and by law of June 14, 1884, they are accorded the same rights as 
men students as far as the examinations are concerned; but in order 
to prepare for the examinations they are obliged to have private 
instruction, as the schools for girls are not of sufficiently high grade to 
prepare for the university studies. They are also allowed to take the 
academic degrees and are permitted to obtain scholarships and lega- 
cies which accrue to the university. The academic board gives sti- 
pendia to those professors who desire to travel or pursue a course of ~ 
study elsewhere. The younger professors oftén avail themselves of this 
stipend in order to perfect themselves further in their profession. The 
faculty of law covers at least four years and gives special attention to 
the codes and to the organization of the judiciary in Norway. The can- 
didate for legal honors is supposed to pass both written and oral exam- 
inations—but not to write a thesis—in law in general, the penal code, 
methods of procedure, law of property, legal processes, Roman law, 
and political economy. The faculty of medicine has laboratories and 
clinies, which are quite in consonance with modern science, each spe- 
cialty being well represented. Its courses occupy six to eight years and 
lead, not tothe doctorate, but simply to the title of lege or physician. 
The faculty of theology is carried on in a similar manner to the Protestant 
faculties in Germany, the course covering at least four years, and a 
weitten examination being required for a degree. The faculty of histori- 
cal and philosophical sciences includes in its courses psychology, meta- 
physics, philosophy, logic, Romanic and Germanic literature, Finnishand 
Semitic languages, Latin, Hebrew, Greek and Scandinavian tongues, En- 
glish philology, Egyptology, history—ancient and modern—history of 
art, archeology, and the physical and political geography of Europe. 
The faculty of mathematical and natural sciences requires of its stu- 
             
-P-A-G-E-538

dents who intend to teach an examination in mathematics and astron- — 
omy, physics and chemistry, natural history and geography, Scandi- 
navian languages, and German, French, and English; the examination 
in the last two groups and in geography is similar to that of the his- 
torico-philosophical faculty. 
Special schools include agriculture, drawing, and. ake s’ schools. The 
courses of study are not clearly defined. . The sailors’ schools receive 
subsidies from both the Governmentand the community and are intended 
more especially for older pupils who have passed through the primary 
schools. Sunday schools might in a sense be classed under this head, 
as they serve to teach the adult population whose early education may 
have been neglected. The course includes the ordinary branches, with 
religious instruction and the reading of portions of Scripture. The agri- 
cultural schools are supported by the provincial authorities. Norwe- 
gian authorities also support a military high school, military naval 
school, and six navigation schools. Technical Abetentary schools for 
young men are also reported, in which schools trades are taught and 
both a theoretical and a practical education is given. Industrial schools 
for girls include regular lessons in needlework, and in the cities in- 
struction fh domestic industries, such as baking, washing, ironing, 
and mending. ‘The courses of study in these various schools are not 
presented, but it is well known that even the humblest peasants receive 
a training which gives them self-reliance and self-respect, and the 
sons of peasants may receivea university education, so few are the re- 
strictions to such a course. 
SCHOOL MANAGEMENT AND METHODS OF DISCIPLINE. 
The management of elementary schools depends in the main upon, 
the school board of each locality, which is supposed to look after the 
interests of the schools, and to report to the higher authorities as to 
- matters in general and as to the funds needed for carrying on said 
schools. As before stated, a board of inspection examines into the 
needs of certain groups of schools, and the teachers form a council for 
the immediate discussion of educational matters. School superintend- 
“ents pass from one locality to another, visiting the educational insti- 
tations of each, and thereby giving information as to the special needs 
of each section, the methods employed, and the necessity of improvement 
or change of base in different parts of the country. The local school 
boards have the power of regulating the hours of school and the plan of 
instruction, but the meeting together of the teachers as a bedy or coun- 
cil for the discussion of school affairs places the general management 
of the schools under their jurisdiction. The children haye a right te 
gratuitous instruction during a seven-year period, although in certain 
localities there are schools which receive both pay and free pupils, 
those who are able to give school fees receiving instruction in the 
‘morning, while in the afternoon the free pupils come in for a similar
-P-A-G-E-539

grade of instruction, so that'a visitor, unless told, does not perceive 
any difference in the methods of instruction, but simply observes that 
different pupils frequent the classes. Absenteeism, unless for cause, 
brings upon the pupil a reprimand and in ease of further neglect of 
school duties the parents are notified, and a continuance of the same 
absence leads to a fine being imposed upon parents or guardians. In 
rural distriets the school authorities endeavor to have the children of 
school age, in sparsely settled districts, attend the Omgangs skole nearest 
their home. In other rural communities they naturally gravitate to. 
the nearest stationary school. In case of the poverty of the parents 
free text-books, and even clothing, may be distributed among the chil- 
dren who otherwise would not receive full school privileges. 
Corporal punishment, as already stated, is permissible in Norway, 
but it can only be given after consultation ‘with the school authorities, 
and in presence of some one of them, while on no account is it to be 
inflicted upon a girl over 10 years of age. 
The school is to be opened and closed with prayer, reading of psalms 
‘or singing; an eminently religious element is to be inculeated in all 
schools, the object being, as heretofore stated, to give a Christian edu- 
cation. The text-books to be employed must contain-nothing contrary 
to the laws governing the country, and no religious text-books can be 
employed other than those approved by the King. The instruction 
must be given in the Norwegian language, although in the Tromsie dis- 
trict text-books in the Lap and Finnish tongues may be used side by _ 
side with those in the Norwegian language. 
The promotion of pupils takes place from class to class, and after the 
requisite examinations from grade to grade. The public examination 
of all pupils takes place once a year, in the presence of the school com- 
mittee, the parish clergyman, and others. All children over 9 years of_ 
age are expected to take part, even those who receive home instruction 
or attend private schools. The pupils usually decide when in the mid- 
die or intermediate schools whether they will follow the course of study 
of the Realschools, leading to practical life, or whether they will 
adopt the gymnasial course, which fits more strictly for the university; 
although, as above stated, pupils from all these schools are admitted to 
university faculties. 
The. methods of study and recitations are similar to those of Sweden 
and other countries. The laws imply that 50, or at most 55 minutes, is 
Jong enough for the first recitation and 45 or 40 minutes for later reci- 
tations. The study and recitations must be interspersed with recesses, _ 
gymnastic exercises, and singing, so that neither body nor mind become 
- too fatigued. 
The school programmes, which are left to local school boards, are 
regulated by law of 1889, which says that the programme for each

SCHOOL ORGANIZATION. 
The fine school buildings throughout Norway are said to always at- 
tract the attention of the traveler, and in the towns they are often the 
most conspicuous structures. As in the other Scandinavian countries, 
the buildings are large and well ventilated. There are broad stairways, 
well-lighted rooms, the light coming in most cases from the left side. 
The buildings are heated by furnaces; each class has sufficient space 
for hanging the outside garments; there are recitation, lunch, and class 
rooms, a room for the head teachers, spacious courtyards for both sexes, 
and rooms or buildings for gymnastic exercises. Special endeavor is 
made by the authorities to have healthy rooms, and before permission 
is given to erect new school buildings the plans must be approved by 
the local school board, the municipal council in cities, and the commit- 
tee on hygiene of the locality; and even then the-matter is referred to 
the higher school authorities, and the board of hygiene and sanitation 
can prohibit the erection of any school building whose plan is not sat- 
isfactory to them. This board has also the power to condemn build-- 
ings or class rooms which are in an unsanitary state. The law of 1889 
is clearly expressed in regard to this matter. It states that in city or 
town schools the school rooms in which the primary schools are housed 
must be sufficiently large for the purposes required. Each school is to 
have the necessary furniture and school apparatus and a court for rec- 
reation purposes. The plan of construction of each new school should 
be submitted to the commission for hygiene and sanitation and to the 
higher inspectorsin charge. The commission ought also to be consulted 
inregard to other buildings intended for school purposes. No build- 
ing should be employed for school purposes which is not favorably re- 
ported upon by said commission. In order to have control of the sani- 
tary condition of the schools, the school board should engage a physician 
to look after such matters, if the municipal authorities permit. 
In rural districts each school should have a separate building, orin 
 
-P-A-G-E-541

the pupils are limited to twenty, ambulatory schools may be carried on. 
The commission for-hygiene and the board for higher inspection must 
look after the construction of new buildings according to the best san- 
itary conditions, and in the rental of buildings the matter of sanitation 
must be rigidly enforced. Each school is to have the necessary school 
furnishings and apparatus. , 
The buildings generally have the desks arranged for two persons 
each. Each school, or, when the school is divided into different classes 
with different instructors, each class should have a room sufficiently 
spacious and provided with all necessary material for the instruction 
-given. The maximum is 40 pupils for a class, although sometimes as 
many as 45 are taught together, but in the elementary division the law 
specifically states that 35 pupils are as many as should be accredited 
to one class. 
The hours of school vary somewhat; in the two lowest divisions they 
usually average 30 to 36 hours a week in the country, but in the city 
the average is 24, and. this may be diminished to 18, if circumstances 
make it advisable and the school authorities so decide. In the middle 
schools the average is 30 hours, and, as above noted, the bill for reform 
in secondary instruction gives from 30 to 36 hours a week in the gym- 
nasia and Realschools, the highest number including, however, gym- 
nastic exercises, singing, etc. 
The schools close on Saturdays; on other days not over 6 hours in 
school are allowable by law, and 5 hours for girls are considered 
sufficient by members of the commission appointed to investigate as to 
overpressure. e 
The recesses vary, as in other countries. Three recesses are usually 
given, two of 10 minutes each, and one of 20 minutes, The holidays 
and vacations amount thrcuginnt the year to 12 weeks, although they 
may be extended to 16 weeks in cities if the authorities so decide. 
School attendance is compulsory for at least 12 weeks each year for 
all children in the country districts from 8 years of age to confirmation, 
and from 7 years to confirmation in the towns. 
According to the law of 1889, which in a measure only emphasizes 
preceding laws, each school is to have the necessary furnishings and 
all indispensable school material. The Norwegians are so intent upon 
giving instruction to all children that in case of poverty of the parents 
the authorities furnish text-books and the necessary clothing, so that 
school privileges may be accorded to all of school age. 
SUPPLEMENTARY INSTITUTIONS. 
The important scientific collections at the university, the’ university 
library of many thousand volumes, a botanical garden, and a magnetic 
and astronomical observatory may be classed as aids to education. 
Among the societies which. give material aid to progress is the 
“Kongl-Norske Videnskabs Selskab i Christiania,” which publishes 
ED 90-33
-P-A-G-E-542
    514 "EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
an annual report of its proceedings, the octavo volume being made up 
of many admirable papers in the sections for mathematics and natural 
sciences, and for history and philosophy. 
The Society of Friends of Work during Lost Hours has for its aim the 
propagation of teaching manual training of different kinds, so as to 
occupy children during hours when they are out of school, as well as 
to furnish them the means of gaining a livelihood outside ef any pro- 
fession which they may take up, or so that during winter evenings they 
may be able to do something which will add to their funds. The so- 
ciety has founded a sort of normal school at Christiania, where children 
and female teachers go to improve themselves in such training, There 
were 400 persons under instruction in 1888. 
Schools for special classes..—Schools for special classes are reported 
as follows: Norway has only occupied itself with the education of the 
blind since 1860. In 1888 instruction is reported as obligatory for that 
class and national institutions have been founded (law of July 8, 1881). 
According to the most recent statistics there are in Norway 160 blind 
persons between the ages of 7 arid 21 years. Hach blind child of more 
than 9 years of age may be admitted gratuitously into state institu- 
tions provided for them. An institute in Christiania receives 51 pu- 
pils, 32 boys and 19 girls, and the methods pursued are as follows: 
Recitations and meals in common, games and premenades in separate 
groups, special attention given to manual training, perhaps less to 
music than is found in some similar schools in Denmark, Fribellian ex- 
ercises much in favor. The instruction is divided into three courses 
covering 28 hours a week for the first course, 30 hours for the second 
and third courses, The division by study is as follows: Religious in- 
struction and reading psalms, 6 hours; history, geography, natural his- 
tory, reading, and singing, 2 hours each; poetry, dictation, arithmetic, 
and gymnastics, 3 hours each. The course in normal training includes, 
among other things, carpentering, wood-carving, chair-caning, turning, 
varnishing, and polishing table legs, ete.; the girls have wood-carving, 
embroidery, cutting out garments, weaving linen, knitting, making 
brushes, baskets, etc. . 
The education of the deaf and dumb dates from 1825, when a national 
institute was created in Trondhjem. In that institute the sign method 
was practiced; in 1848 a second institution was established in Schaft- 
tellékken, a suburb of Christiania, which from the beginning had the 
articulation method. Several private institutions which received State 
subsidies, some of them externats, but all employing the articulation 
' method, were established from time to time. Finally, a law of June 8, 
1883, rendered elementary instruction obligatory for the deaf-mutes 
and required them to attend school from the seventh to the seventeenth 
year, the course of instruction to be similar to that of the elementary

grades, with the learning of a trade added. In 1888 there were nine 
such schools, all of which, with the exception of the free institute at 
Trondhjem, instruct according to the articulation method. The sign 
language is used at Trondhjem, but is reserved for those pupils who 
have passed the school age and who are lacking in intellectual devel- 
opment. There are about 600 deaf and dumb persons in Norway from 
7 to 20 years of age. The institution at Sehafftelékken, which is in- 
stalled amidst rural surroundings on a height overlooking the Bay of 
Christiania, has 76 pupils of both sexes and admits externats. Tnstruc- 
tion is purely oral and for the highest class, the eighth, it includes re- 
ligion, Norwegian grammar, reading exercises and poetry, arithmetic, 
history,.geography, natural history, drawing, gymnastics; in the lowest, 
or first class, religious exercises, articulation, and training the powers 
of observation. Manual training is developed to the point of being 
considered as the basis of a trade or profession. 
A law of 1881 renders instruction obligatory for such imbeciles as are 
capable of being taught, but although there are 1,660 idiots in Norway 
the schools are not sufficient for that number. A school of this class 
for girls, situated at Thorksang, a suburb of Christiania, is maintained 
by State, departmental, and communal subsidies. Founded in 1876, it 
had 135 pupils in 1888, The building is a fine one, with 33 rooms, 
among them 16 class rooms, all well furnished with desks suitable for 
one person, which are arranged in a semicircle. The school material 
consists of pictures of plants, animals, landscapes; plaster casts suitable 
for instruction in drawing and to train the artistic sense; Swedish gym- 
nastic apparatus in one room for the children when tired of sitting; all 
kinds of material tending to instruct for the practical side of life; a 
model of a town house of several stories appropriately furnished; a 
peasant’s house, a stable, a kitchen, a dairy, all large enough so that 
the children get a thorough conception of such establishments; speci- 
mens of the animal ereation in relief; grocers’ and drapers’ establish- 
ments, where they can learn to purchase articles, count money, ete. _ 
The theoretical side of the teaching includes religion, the mother tongue, 
reading, writing, arithmetic, drawing, singing, gymnastics, history, and 
geography. The professional side includes that of machine and hand 
sewing, mending, crocheting, knitting, weaving, basket-making, ete. 
Those who are not intellectually developed to the extent of the above 
instruction are simply taught color, form, numbers, and whatever may 
give them an insight into practical life. Festivals, dances, and other 
pleasures are given several times a year in large rooms well arranged for 
such purposes. An asylum for epileptic children and a normal course 
to prepare special teachers are annexed to this institution. A similar 
school for boys and another at Trondhjem, with a fourth school which 
was to be opened in 1889, completed this class of schools. 
Asylums are established in many towns where little children from 2 
to 7 years of age are not only taken care of but also instructed in the 
  es 
  
   
-P-A-G-E-544

first elements. These asylums are supported partly by public funds, 
but chiefly by voluntary annual contributions.. The amount applied to 
the support of asylums in the country is not estimated at more than 
6,000 specie dollars.

INTRODUCTION, 
The constitution of Denmark was originally embodied in the organic 
law of June 5, 1849; it has since undergone various revisions, the most 
recent being through a statute which received the royal sanction July 
28, 1866. This constitution is based on the most liberal principles; the 
king shares his power, which had been hitherto wellnigh absolute, with 
a diet (Rigsdag) of two houses (Landsthing and Folksthing), both 
elective. The Folksthing discusses the budget and other public ques- 
tions; the Landsthing attends to the local affairs of the provinces. The 
State religion is Evangelical Lutheran; it was introduced in 1536, the 
church revenue having been seized at that date by the crown, to be 
delivered up to the university and other religious and educational — 
establishments. The King must be a member of that church; religious 
affairs are under the superintendence of seven bishops, who have no 
political functions. Ninety-nine per cent of the entire population is 
Lutheran, though complete toleration is enjoyed. 3 
Denmark is divided into provinces, Amter or counties, and parishes. 
The centers of population, Copenhagen excepted, are the Kjébstaeder 
or cities, which number sixty-six, the principal ones being: Odense, on

the island of Fionia; Helsingér, in Seeland; Aarhus, Aalborg, Ran- 
ders, Horsens, and Viborg, in Jutland. The provinces, which vary in 
size from 221 to 9,597 English square miles, are divided into eighteen 
counties or Amter, which are subdivided into sixty districts, and these 
again into numerous school districts (in 1867 there were 2,399; of 
these, 1,081 in the islands and 1,318 in Jutland). The seven provinces 
correspond to the church dioceses; thrée are on the islands and four on 
the mainland. 
Iceland, the chief dependency of the crown, has its own-constitution 
and administration by a charter of January 5, 1874, which went into op- 
eration August 1, 1874, and by the terms of which the legislative power 
is vested in the Althing. A minister for Iceland, appointed by the King, 
is at the head of the administration, while the highest local authority 
is vested in a governor-general. There are alsotwo Amtmend, or 
under governors, for the northern and western districts of Ieeland. 
HISTORICAL SKETCH. 
The conyent and cathedral schools, which date from the introduction . 
of Christianity in 965, were but the forerunners of the famous Latin 
schools established in Viborg, Ribe, Odense, and Copenhagen for 
elericals and laymen of the higher classes. The Reformation period 
brought about the establishment of two grades of Latin schools, which 
were under clerical supervision, and admitted students from both 
urban and rural districts to the three or four classes into which they 
were divided. A third class of schools—the schole vulgares, Skii- 
veskoler, or writing schools—omitted Latin, and were under the super- 
vision of municipal authorities. The schools at the commencement of 
the sixteenth century were almost entirely city schools; the country 
population had almost no instruction, unless possibly in the cate- 
chism from the Sacristan or Degn of the parish, who brought to- 
gether the neighboring children of a rural domain or gaard. King 
Frederic IV (1699-1730) was the first ruler to seriously give thought to 
the organization of people’s schools. In each of the twelve districts 
which were dependencies of the crown he established twenty schools, 
each with a school room and a lodging for a teacher, who was to give 
instruction in religion and reading in exchange for a moderate salary 
and lodging. This plan of establishing schools was soon followed by 
members of the nobility, so that on many estates the children of the 
tenantry were being taught the rudiments, under the supervision of 
the clergy. A royal decree of 1721 regulated the organization of such 
schools, fixed the teachers’ salaries, made religion and reading obliga- 
tory branches, writing and arithmetic optional bramches, and required . 
children between 5 and 8 years of age to attend school’daily from five 
to six hours; after that age half a day’s schooling was considered to be 
enough.
-P-A-G-E-549
  EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM OF DENMARK, 521 
During the reign of Christian VI (1730-1746) city schools were reor- 
ganized. Elementary instruction was rendered obligatory by a decree 
of January 23, 1739, and new schools were organized in rural districts. 
A decree of the same year required the establishment of common 
schools: in all the large villages; in which schools religion, reading, 
writing, and arithmetic were to be taught by persons whose qualifica- 
tions -had been verified by the clergymen of the vicinity. The support 
of such schools depended on a revenue fund, school taxes, contributions, 
and fines. Several of the Latin schools mentioned above were closed. 
and their funds were used for these lower schools, and the course of 
study in the remaining Latin schools was extended, and the Danish 
language, instead of the Latin, was made a principal study. Although 
the eighteenth century was marked by many efforts to extend the 
system of instruction, dissensions occurred among the landed gentry, 
who preferred to maintain each his own set of schools, and who often- 
times employed incapable persons living on the estate, which prevented 
the success of this attempt at a school system, especially as many of 
the peasant class were merely vassals of these seigneurs, whe cared but 
little to have them taught. But during the reigns of Christian VII and. 
Fredric VI great reforms were inaugurated. Servitude was done away 
with in 1788; the first normal school was established in 179091, at 
Blaagaard near Copenhagen (transferred to Jénstrup in 1809); and two 
decrees were promulgated July 29, 1814, which regulated the organiza- 
tion of elementary instruction in rural and urban districts, Copenhagen 
excepted. These decrees, whose principal features are still in force, 
established two-class elementary schools in rural districts, in localities 
rich enough to maintain such schools, and two schools in each of the 
larger villages. If feasible, burgher schools, higher grade schools, and. 
evening classes for adults were to be added, and obligatory attendance 
in elementary grades was recognized as a feature of the school system. 
At about this date (1814) five schools for the training of teachers were 
established in sections of the country away from the central normal 
school, which dated from1791, 4. ¢., one at Skaarup, in the island of Fionia, 
and three at Lynby, Ranum, and Jelling, in Jutland. Modifications of 
the law of 1814 were made from time to time; in 1828 gymnastics were 
introduced in all the schools of Denmark; in 1838 many higher grade 
schools were created; in 1850 changes were made in the form of second- 
ary schools, some of which were transformed into gymnasia while others 
were changed to Real schools. Laws of 1844 and 1857 applied more 
especially to the schools of Copenhagen; those of 1855, 1856, and 1864 
_ related to the urban and rural schools, with the exception of Copenha- 
gen. Thedecrees or laws of 1850, 1864, and 1869 regulated the examina- 
tions for adinission to the university of Copenhagen, which was founded. 
in 1478-79. A royal decree of January 27, 1860, fixed the minimum of 
school attendance at 240 days of 6 hours each. Regulations which
-P-A-G-E-550
    522 3 EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
applied to the training schools for teachers were dated February 10, 
1818, February 15, 1857, and January 12, 1858. 
In Iceland, which became subject to Denmark in 1380, the first school 
can be traced to 981. Few if any illiterates are to be found in that or 
any other Scandinavian country, for in Iceland the clergy are. forbid- 
den to act at the marriage ceremony of any woman who can not read. 
Education is universal, and the intellectual attainments of the people 
are of a superior order. The college at Reikiavik has a corps of six 
or more teachers, who instruct about one hundred pupils in Latin, 
French, German, and theology. This is the only public school of high 
grade reported in that dependency, but there are still other schools, 
and many valuable works of European literature have been translated 
into Icelandic for popular use. 
SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
The present school system of Denmark, based upon the decrees of 1814, 
_isan establishment of the State, which early recognized the need of oblig- 
atory instruction for all children between 7 and 14 years of age. Relig- 
ious instruction being a main element in the schools, the study of the | 
Bible, the catechism, and the Psalms being objects of daily lessons, and 
confirmation being the local act which closes the school period fer child- 
ren, the general sapervision of schools is naturally in the hands of the 
clergy. The law of 1814 indeed exacts that school directors be candidates 
in theology. The educational institutions have reached a high degree 
of perfection, and are all dependent upon and under the control of the 
University of Copenhagen. The law (1814) makes it obligatory on all 
parents that their children should attend school or receive similar home 
instruction, fines or imprisonment being the penalties imposed in case 
of nonobservance of the law. The circumstance that certificates of con- 
firmation are indispensable to those who wish to enter the public service, 
to serve an apprenticeship, or to enter the marriage state, has of itself 
the effect of making school attendance nearly universal, so that illiter- 
acy is almost unknown. It belongs to the State to see that each com- 
mune is provided with suitable buildings for the needed education, but 
gratuitous instruction is limited to those who can not, or will not, pay 
for such instruction. The schools are divided into (1) elementary— 
which im the larger cities are of two classes, pay schools (Betallings- 
skoler) and free schools (Friskoler), and in the country include ambula- 
tory schools (Biskoler) and people’s higher schools (Folkehoiskoler) ; (2) 
secondary schools, including Realskoler, hoiere Realskoler, or lerde 
Skoler, i. e., pay schools above the elementary grades, fitting for practi- 
eal life and a higher classical school, the so-called learned schools; (3) 
normal schools (Seminarier), for the instruction of men only, such 
schools for women not having been established as yet, although the 
subject is freely discussed; (4) the university, with its legal, medical,

philosophical, and theological faculties; (5) and, lastly, special schools, 
such as technical and polytechnic schools, veterinary and agricultural 
schools, schools for the defective classes, navigation schools, and an 
academy of fine arts. As adjuncts to the elementary grades, there are 
infant asylums, drawing schools, Sunday schools, and evening schools 
for adults. There are also private schools, for both sexes, in the large © 
cities. : 
State and local control.—The Minister of Ecclesiastical Affairs and 
Public Instruction is at the head of the educational system of the 
Kingdom. His special aids are the bishops, who visit the schools in 
their respective dioceses, reporting annually to headquarters; and two 
general inspectors—one for music the other for gymnastics—for the 
whole Kingdom, 
The local officers who keep the minister informed, either directly or 
indirectly, as to educational affairs throughout Denmark, are the 
county school boards and school councils, the district school boards, 
and the communal council and special school committees in the various 
wards in cities, and in the parishes of rural districts. The special at- 
tributes of these various officials are presented under supervision and 
administration. 
Maintenance.—For the maintenance of elementary schools each county 
has a school fund, formed by an annual state appropriation, by reve- 
nues from ancient foundations, and by city and district taxes. This 
school fund is employed for such expenditures as the districts can not 
easily meet, ¢. ¢., for extra pay to teachers, teachers’ pensions, people’s 
high schools, drawing schools, ete. The main support of the elemen- 
tary schools depends, however, upon the district funds, which are em- 
ployed for the construction of school buildings, the purchase of school 
apparatus, pay of teachers, ete. 
Normal schools are maintained by the state. Secondary schools 
have for years had their own funds, and consequently do not require 
aid from the state. The university also has its own funds, although 
all these higher grade schools receive certain subsidies for specific pur- 
poses. : 
STATISTICS. 
With a population in 1890 of 2,185,157, the pupils enrolled in city 
and rural schools in Denmark numbered 231,940, or about 10 per cent 
of the population receiving the foundation of an education. In 1881 
the illiterates to 100 recruits numbered 0.36; in Sweden at that date, 
the per cent was 0.39, : 
The statistics of schools of all grades in Denmark can not be pre- 
sented for a late date, as the minister of public instruction has not so 
far given tothe public any general statistics appertaining to the dif- 
ferent grades of education in Denmark.

‘Yotal number of pupils 
  \ 
At the close of 1890 there were about 5,000 children in school who were 
not under the school board, so that the total number of the school chil- 
dren was 41,800. The expenditure for these schools amounted to 
$289,500, The tuition fees reach $2,123. In 1880 there were only 
13,838 pupils reported in the Copenhagen schools, in 448 classes, so that

the increase in six years, owing in part to the new buildings erected, 
was 8,200 pupils in 271 classes. The teaching force of the Copenhagen 
schools comprises 619 members—291 men, 328 women, the infant classes 
only being under the charge of women. The salaries vary. For the ~ 
men they range from $270 to $482; for the women from $270 to $308, 
The schools of Copenhagen have about 800 classes, with an average of 
31 pupils to a class. The expenditure for each pupil amounts to 50 
crowns ($13) annually, which is about $1.07 per capita of the population 
of the city. Each school has its inspector, its vice-inspector, and vice- 
inspectress, a corps of regular teachers, and also special- teachers for 
singing, gymnastics, drawing, and woman’s handiwork. The large and ~ 
well-arranged school buildings, erected between 1846 and 1887, ayver- 
aged in cost $47,600. Each school has an average of twenty class 
rooms, a gymnastic hall, and lodgings for the inspector, the inspectress, 
and the janitors. The schools are six-class schools, with continuation 
classes for those who desire to pursue their education still further. 
Such pupils obtain instruction in German and bookkeeping. 4 
A special class-of schools, foundedin Denmark in 1840, called the © 
Folkehoiskoler, or people’s high schools, are designed to elevate the 
standard of education among the rural population and make the peas- 
ant classes acquainted with national history and literature. Similar 
schools are reported in both Sweden and Norway, and in all three 
countries they are recognized as especially valuable to those who live 
in rural districts. The majority of the pupils in these schools are from 
17 to 30 years of age. The young men attend school from November 
till April, the young women from May to August; a few of the schools 
have both sexes together. The Folkehoiskoler differs from the ordinary — 
continuation school, as it does not continue the studies of the elemen- 
tary grades, but aims to broaden knowledge and to cause thein to real- 
ize that they have only taken the first steps in education. _The eminent 
pedagogue, N. F. 8. Grundtvig (1783-1872), is looked upon as the foun-_ 
der of these schools, although he never had charge of any. His idea 
was to awaken the feeling and thought of the people. The first school 
of this class was established in 1844 in Rédding; they developed in 1879 - 
to a class of free people’s academies with several years’ course of in- 
struction. The number of the people’s higher schools is said to be 
seventy, although this is really an approximation, as there are special 
and continuation schools which are so similar in character that the 
difference is not easily discernible. They are attended by 2,899 men 
and 1,595 women. According to age of students the statistics are as 
follows: 15 to 18 years, 503 men and 284 women; 18 to 25 years, 1,890 
men, 1,053 women; over 25 years, 506 men, and 253 women, but this 
number did not include 112 male students at the continuation school 
in Askoy. Of the 4,494 pupils 955 had already taken a course of study 
and had returned to continue their education.

‘The state-schools! which aftord a classical education are the Metropoli- 
tanskoler in Kjébenhavn, 7 Katedralskoler in Roskilde, Odense, Ny- 
kjébing near Falster, Aarhus, Aalbog, Viborg, and Ribe, and the 
schools of Randers, Horsens, and Hilleréd (Frederiksborg lerde skole) 
and the Soré academic secondary school (Soré Akademie lerde Skole’). 
The number of pupils in the above-enumerated public schools was 
1,863 in the year 1890. Statistics of attendance for the past fifteen 
years indicate an increase from 1,110 pupils in 1875, to 1,719 in 1882, 
and a gradual decrease from 1,965 in 1886, to 1,863 in 1890. The 17 pri- 
vate lwrde skoler or secondary classical schools include the Westen- 
ske Institut, the burgher schools of Christiansands and Copenhagen, 
12 Latin og Realskoler, a lyceum which was formerly a Latin and Real 
school, but has now changed its form somewhat, and another four class 
school—the Efterlegts-Selskabets skole, which is under the control of 
asociety. These schools were established at dates between 1850 (that of 
the Westenske Institut) and 1887 (that of the Helsingér Latin og Reals- 
kole). Inaddition to the above classical or lerde skoler, which prepare for 
the university or a professional career, there are 11 communal Real 
schools, 7 special Real schools at Kjébenhavn, Odense, Hjéring, etc. 
There are also 36 private Real schools and 15 Real schools for women, 
' all of which are in a manner preparing pupils for examinations to en- 
.ter higher grade schools. There are in all 98 schools which prepare 
for the Real examinations, and 69 of them are exclusively Real schools, 
or secondary schools leading to practical life. The courses of study 
and organization of these higher grade schools are enumerated under 
the proper headings. 
The university averages about 1,000 students annually in attendance 
in its five faculties. In 1877, there were 963 students registered; in 
1878, between 836 and 947 in the different semestri; in 1880, - first 
semester 931, second, 1,057. In 1881 aslight decrease was manifest, 7. ¢., 
867 students in the spring term, and 1,040 in the fallterm. Later 
advices bring the number up to about 1,300 students. Connected with 
- the university is the polytechnicum, or Polytekniske Lereanstalt, which 
had in its classes from 338 te 295 students in 1890-91. Its course of 
study is presented under the appropriate head. Z : 
The technical school of the scientific society in Copenhagen—which is 
a pay school, but with numerous scholarships maintained by the Min- 
istry of Public Instruction, the city, and the society—is frequented an- 
nually by about 2,000 pupils. Its five principal divisions are (1) the 
evening school, where, from 4 to 10 p. m., during the months from October 
1 to July 1, instruction is given in the common branches, natural and 
physical sciences, drawings of all kinds, modeling, sculpture, land- 
scape gardening, theory of colors, chemistry of constructive material,

etc.; (2) the day school for mechanical and constructive work, combined _ 
with the ordinary branches; (3) the school of painting and sculpture 
from art and nature; (4) the institute for metal workers, repoussé 
work, modeling in wax, etching and engraving; (5) and the school of 
industrial arts. This school is really the cradle of all art and manual 
training schools of thecountry. : 
A similar special school of art training for women has an annual State 
subsidy of $2,144 and is annually attended by from 400 to 500 pupils 
whe receive instruction from 12 professors under the direction of five 
members of the Academy of Fine Arts. This school has quite a practical 
character, its courses aiming more especially to train women to be self- 
supporting by means of art and industrial work, which is often ordered 
and frequently purchased by outsiders at an annual sale. The three 
courses comprise elementary instruction, industrial arts, and decorative 
arts, which include geometric, stereometric, and perspective drawing, 
aquarelles, painting on porcelain, history of the fine arts, wood carving, 
engraving, copperplate, anatomical studies, etc., as well as most — 
branches of industrial arts. 
Statistics of other special schools are not presented in any of the 
material now on file in this Office, except in the case of a few institu- 
tions which are either intended for the defective classes, are under the 
control of yarious societies, or purely of a private character. These are 
presented under the head of supplementary institutions, as they do not 
generally come in for a share of the regular school fund. 
FINANCE, 
Denmark ranks as one of the most advanced countries in Europe in 
point of expenditure for elementary instruction. The expenditure for 
each inhabitant averages $1.54’ throughout the kingdom. Financial 
affairs, as far as they appertain to schools, are placed under the supreme 
control-of the minister of public instruction; the main support of elée- 
mentary schools depends upon county or district funds, with certain 
governmental subsidies for stated purposes. The normal schools are 
maintained entirely by State funds; the secondary schools and the 
university have their own funds, and are consequently not dependent 
upon the annual amounts voted for the ministerial budget by the Rigs- 
dag. The district or communal authorities vote the necessary funds 
for construction and repairs, heating, and purchase of school material 
and for teachers’. salaries in the elementary schools of their respective 
leealities. The annual increase of the salaries of teachers, their pen- — 
sions and those for the widow and orphan are taken from a school fund 
in each county, which fund is also used for the maintenance of the 
peoples’ high schools, drawing schools, etc. This county school fund 
is formed by an annual subsidy from the State, divided among the 
counties, from revenues from taxation and contributions. It is under 
the direct control-of the county school board and the school council;

nothing in their efforts to thoroughly educate all classes. 
SUPERVISION AND ADMINISTRATION, 
State control—The supreme control of all schools is delegated to the 
Minister of Ecclesiastical Affairs and Public Instruction, in whose min- 
istry there are two sections: The one for the supervision of ecclesias- 
tical: affairs, elementary, and normal schools, blind and deaf-mute in- 
stitutions; the other for the supervision of secondary and higher 
schools, libraries, museums, and academies. In each diocese the Lu-

theran bishop is expected to act as aid to the ministry by visiting the 
schools and reporting annually. An inspector-general for the whole 
kingdom, in charge of music, and an inspector for gymnastic training 
complete the list of higher school officers, who, by means of the reports 
forwarded to them by local officers, are kept advised of educational 
affairs throughout the kingdom. 
Local control.—In each rural commune or parish, and in each town, 
the administration of public schools belongs to a school commission— 
Skole commission—composed of the pastor, as presiding officer, and of 
- two other members appointed for three years by the communal coun- 
cil. Outranking the school commission, in each district or subdivision 
of the county, is the school board—Skole direction—composed of the 
Amtmand, or sheriff, of the District Provst, or first ecclesiastical digni-- 
tary of the district, and of a third member designated by the school 
council of the county. The school board—Skole direction—of the district 
generally appoints the teachers, arranges the programme of studies, » 
and chooses the classical text-books, although the teachers are allowed 
much freedom of action in this matter. The school council—Skoleraad— ’~ 
of each county is composed of the members of the county administra- 
tive council, or Amtsraad, and of several members elected by the towns » 
or cities. The duties of this council appertain almost entirely to the 
financial questions, as do those of the Amts-skoledirection, or svhool 
board of the county, which is composed of all the school boards of 
the districts, or subdivisions of the county, under the presidency of the 
sheriff or Amtmand. . 
In Copenhagen the school board is composed of the mayor, a member 
of the aldermanic council, and an ecclesiastical functionary designated 
by the Minister of Ecclesiastical Affairs and Public Instruction. <A diree- 
tor or inspector is especially charged with all that concerns the admin- 
istration of the schools. He is a consulting member of the school 
board, which is composed of three members. Hach of the wards of the 
capital has a school committee composed of three members, 4. e., a cler- 
gyman appointed by the Minister of Public Instruction, a member elected 
by the communal council, and a third member appointed by the school 
board. Each public school has an ‘inspector, who is a member of the 
teaching force, having fewer hours of recitation than his colleagues and 
receiving higher pay. His special duty is to look after absentees and 
to call the parents to account for such negligence. 
As will be observed, the clergy and the county and. district officer's 
are by their very presence on school boards or committees so placed 
that they become educational factors of the kingdom. The Danes are, 
as it were, either educators or so interested in advancing education 
that bishops, sheriffs, aldermen, and teachers proper are all acting as 
aids to the ministry at headquarters, so that its influence exends to 
all parts of the kingdom.

TEACHERS. 
Training of teachers.—In order to prepare teachers for the position to 
be occupied, the State has established four normal schools, which give 
the requisite instruction to men who may be seeking the position of 
instructor. These normals are situated in Seeland, Fionie, and Jutland. 
Private institutions are also reported, and for the training of women 
teachers that of a private institution is the only opportunity offered, 
_ although the subject of the regular establishment of training schools 
for Women teachers has been freely diseussed of late years by persons 
interested in progressive educational movements, and the outcome of 
such discussions will probably lead to the establishment of such schools 
for women. The normal schools have in general the same organization, 
a director and three or four professors having charge of the instruc- 
tion, which is both of a theoretical and practical character. Each school 
has its gymnastic teacher, who, being a military man in active service, 
is changed every three years. Generally speaking the directors are 
- ecclesiastics, who hold a curacy in addition to their directorship, the 
State according them a curate as assistant. The duration of studies 
is three years, divided into three courses or classes. The age of 
candidates is from 17 to 23 years, and proof is required that the candi- 
date has followed a practical course of at least one year in an elementary 
school. Pupils are admitted to these normals after a competitive ex- 
amination at the close of the school year. The written theses for such 
examination comprehend dictation, Danish composition, consisting in 
a recitation, the explanation of a proverb, a suggestion in regard to 
moral teaching, writing, arithmetical computations, ete. The oral ex- 
amination covers questions in regard to grammar, grammatical analysis, 
arithmetical questions, Danish history, universal geography, religion, 
and sacred history. These normal schools being all situated in rural 
districts, a model school annexed may open its doors to both sexes. 
Normal professors preside at the lessons. Pupil teachers of the third 
year of the course give the instruction. 
The normals are not gratuitous; for instance, at Jénstrup $81 is 
charged for boarding pupils and $10. fees are required of day pupils. 
Children of teachers are admitted free of charge, however. Scholar- 
ships are allowed to the amount of $2,065 annually. The director at 
Jénstrup has a salary of $1,305, with lodging and garden. Other di- 
rectors, being curates also and having day pupils, receive from $216 to 
$324. The professors’ salaries range from $447 to $640 since 1889, as a 
ministerial decree of that period raised their salaries. The total ex- 
penditure for all normals in 1887 was $8,009, rentals not included. 
Teachers’ institutes and conferences are also held, which, by discus- 
sions of educational questions, aid teachers in carrying on their educa- 
tional work. The Sixth Educational Congress of Scandinavian teach- 
ers was held in Copenhagen, August 5-8, 1890, over 5,300 teachers 
 
-P-A-G-E-559
EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM OF DENMARK. ce BBio 
taking part in the discussions. Among the number were 3,000 
Danes, 1,100 Norwegians, 1,000 Swedes, and 200 Finns and Iceland- 
ers; in all, 3,000 men and 2,300 women. This is stated to be one 
of the largest congresses ever held in the northern countries. The 
first subject under discussion was that of religious instruction, the 
decisions being that less dogma and more church history be taught, — 
but that through a study of the whole Bible, with a teacher who must 
himself be a believer and Christian, the pupils would be led directly to 
Christ. A discussion of the object of instruction in school was then 
taken up, the paper by Prof. Dr. Kroman, of Christiania, awakening 
much interest, as the speaker laid great stress on the need of a full 
understanding that the object of school instruction is to educate the 
child, and not especially to prepare for examinations, The subject of 
scientific temperance teaching was then proposed as a branch of study 
for the schools. Next followed a discussion of teachers’ salaries, as 
it was impossible for a teacher to be in the proper spirit for instructing 
children or having the proper discipline if his mind had to be-devoted 
to petty economies. Physical education as conducted in England, by = 
outdoor sports, next entered into the discussion, the speakers considering 
that much could be learned from that nation. Coeducation was also 
favored, as being beneficial to both sexes. Other papers were given 
on instruction in Sléjd, the mother tongue, and in the Latin language. | 
The teacher was also urged to’ keep up with the times in regard to Rus- 
sian, French, and Norwegian literature as well as in regard to other 
matters of general interest. Special stress was laid upon the prepara- 
tion for a teacher’s position as far as discipline, methods, singing, the 
care of the deaf and dumb and orphans were concerned. The visiting 
teachers were in general the guests of people in Copenhagen. Low 
railway and steamboat rates were obtained and a grand banquet with 
. illuminations, etc., ended a particularly successful meeting. 
Examinations.—By law of July 25, 1867, a commission composed of 
eleven members, appointed by the government, attends to the exam- 
ination of persons who desire to obtain a teacher’s position. Such per- 
sons must present themselves for examination whether they have re- 
ceived the diploma of-a normal school or not. This commission meets 
annually in Copenhagen and two other cities of the kingdom. 
Appointment.—Teachers are ieually appointed to the elementary 
grades by the school board of the district, according to the suggestion 
of the communal council and the bishop. 
Salaries.—The salaries of teachers vary in different places. In Copen- 
hagen salaries average from $270 to $482 for men and from $270 to — 
$308 for women; in other cities and in rural districts there is an an- 
nual fixed amount, a certain quantity of grain, free lodging, and in the 
country a piece of ground and wood for fires, which brings up the sum 
total to an average similar to the above. The authorities also arrange 
for a gradual increase in pay as the term of service lengtheus.

Pensions.—After having taught a certain number of years teachers 
are entitled to a pension, which amounts to about two-thirds of thei 
salary. To receive such pension the teacher must be at least 30 years 
of age. There are also funds set aside for the benefit of the widows 
and orphans of teachers, so that they may not be left in straitened 
circumstances. : 
COURSES OF STUDY. 
_In the elementary schools a certain amount of freedom is left to each 
teacher in regard to the course of study best suited to the school 
under his charge, and equal freedom is allowed in regard to the text 
books used. In rural schools the branches of instruction are reading, 
writing, arithmetic, religion and biblical history, gymnastics, singing, 
and the elements of history and geography. In the city schools a more 
extended course is found, the schools being divided into two classes, 
those which last all day and those which have from four to five hours 
instruction only. The course of study in the elementary schools of 
Copenhagen, which schools serve as a model for the whole country, is 
as follows, the number of hours a week being given for all the classes 
in each branch of study, the duration of daily work being from four to’ 
five hours. The two schools which are taken as models are those which 
have the largest attendance, the one a free school; ; in the other tuition 
feés are charged:

In all these schools. the sexes are separated. Special attention is 
paid in all Scandinavian schools to those gymnastic exercises which 
tend to develop the muscle and to render tlie body supple and agile of 
movement. In place of gymnastic exercises in summer, swimming is 
obligatory. In schools for girls lessons are given in cutting, fitting, in 
fact in needlework from the simplest methods through a course of pro- 
gressive exercises (illustrated on the blackboard, point by point, by the 
teacher), up to the successful completion of underwear, hosiery, em-

    EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM OF DENMARK. | ¥< Dees 
broidery,etc. The classes of younger pupils commence by cutting paper | 
of the proper dimensions, and finally in the last year of the course make 
garments according to specified instructions. Thus both theoretical 
and practical instruction is given during the seven years school period. 
In the country districts the people’s high schools for the benefit of 
farmers and farmers’ sons have a plan of instruction which depends 
entirely upon the wishes of their patrons, and. the capacity of the teach- 
ers, who are usually university graduates. Lectures are given on prac-— 
tical subjects appertaining to the science of agriculture, and on the 
history and institutions of the Kingdom. ; 
In the burgher schools, which are similar in character to the German 
real schools, but are not of so high a grade as the Danish realskoler, 
the course of study comprises Danish, French, German, English, his- 
tory, geography, arithmetic, geometry, natural history, penmanship, 
and drawing. In the secondary schools, so-called—that is, those which 
inelude the gymnasia and real schools—there is a continuation of the 
courses in the elementary grades. A more specific statement for such 
schools is as follows: - % 
The middle or secondary schools of Denmark, which received their 
present form in 1850, have six-year courses. They are divided into 
gymnasia or classical schools, and Real schools, or those for practical 
life. The gymnasia (lerde skoler) have a division for languages and his- 
tory (sprolighistorisk), and for mathematics and sciences (matematisk-. 
naturvidenskabelig). In the four lower classes the courses are identical, 
except that in these classes the Real schools have no Greek, and the 
gymuasia no geometrical drawing or science. School attendance in 
these schools is from the twelfth to the eighteenth year. In the gym- 
nasia French is obligatory for all six years; German only through the 
fourth class, although the student may continue it or take English in- 
stead in the upper classes. The Real schools have three modern lan- 
guages obligatory. At the closing examination a French exercise is 
handed in, and the pupils are examined verbally in German or English. 
A decree of 1883 required the Real school students who wished to go 
to the polytechnic or the academy of forestry to pass an examination 
in three languages; other students only in English, with either German 
or French. 
The courses of study in the normal schools of the Kingdom include 
religious instruction (dogma, moral precepts, sacred history, biblical 
antiquities, geography of the Holy Land), Danish language (grammar, 
style, history of literature), history of Denmark and universal history, 
geography of the world, arithmetic, algebra and geometry, stereometry, 
elements of astronomy and meteorology, natural history and physics, 
pedagogy, writing and reading, drawing, vocal and instrumental music 
(viol and organ), gymnastics. Manual training and modern lan- 
guages do not enter into the course, but there is discussion in regard to 
supplying this lack. The director gives from. sixteen to eighteen hours -

of lessons a week; the professors have thirty hours instruction. The : 
lessons continue fare during a six to seven hours’ period. 
The division of studies during the three years’ period is as follows:

For the professional training of teachers a school of application is 
“attached to the normal proper. -The students, above all those of the 
third year, practice in the school of application under general supervi- 
sion of the professors, who preside at the lessons and aid the would-be 
teachers by their comments upon the methods pursued. During the 
week students of the other classes are invited in to observe and listen 
to the criticisms made. At the close of the first and second school 
years an examination takes place before the student can pass to the 
class above. The examination at the close of the school preparatory 
to the candidate’s accepting a teacher’s position, is before a commission 
of from nine to twelve educators, which meets in Copenhagen, Aarhus, 
or Odense. This method is, however, not considered eminently satis- 
- factory, on account of the difficulty of proving the candidate’s real 
efficiency, and there is probability of a change. 
The University of Copenhagen in its*course of study embraces law 
and political science, theology, medicine, philosophy, literature, and 
philology, mathematical sciences, etc. The methods of instruction in 
the university may be best understood by quoting from a letter of May 
14, 1891, from the dean of the law faculty to the Minister of Public 
Instruction, which was forwarded in response to a request from this 
Office in regard to legal education. He states that— 
The faculty of law and political science in the university at Copenhagen covers, 
in its course, all points of the laws of Denmark, Roman law, the philosophy of law. 
(Rets filosofi), andlaws of bankruptcy. The juridical faculty consists of five profes- 
sors who are paid by the State from: 3,200 to 6,000 crowns ($857 to $1,608), while the 
older professors are allowed 1,200 crowns ($321) annually for house rent. The pro- 
fessors are not allowed to hold other public office during their incumbency of the 
professorship. The professor usually limits himself to instruction in one branch of 
law, and, as a general rule, gives one hour’s lesson each week day from February 1 
to June 9, and from the 1st of September to July there is a form of examination, and 
the professors take into consideration the books most needed in order to give a firm 
basis to the study of the kind of laws under consideration. At the close of the
-P-A-G-E-563
EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM OF DENMARK. 535 
. 5s 3 
year’s instruction, when the term has expired, the professors examine those who 
have attended the course. A number of legal lights act as censors, or board of ex. 
aminers, to take into consideration the results of such course of instruction. Those 
who have passed the maturity examination (candidat juris) and who are properl; 
naturalized citizens have the right of admission to office, in which position their 
knowledge of law and of the rights of citizenship is available to them until they be- 
come full-fledged lawyers. Until that time they can make use of the intervening 
period for carrying out in practice what they have learned in theory. 
According to a regulation of September 26, 1890, in relation to the legal examina- 
tion for further advancement and of a subsequent one for the completed examina- 
tion as lawyer (fuldstiindige juridiske examen), the requirements are less compre- 
hensive in character. He who can practically demonstrate that he has sufficient” 
legal knowledge to obtain the right of admission to a lower court of law will,in this 
manner, obtain by this new ruling the right of presentation. 
The lectures, as well as the examinations, are held in the university building. Those 
who desire the right or title to be present at the lectures must show that they have 
obtained such right by the passing of a graduation examination, according to pre- 
determined regulations, at either public or private schools, and in order to be per- 
mitted to attend the examination for entrance to the legal faculty they must also 
have passed an examination in philosophical branches in the university, as is re- 
quired by the university regulations after a year of study. All of the lectures in 
the legal faculty of the university are gratuitous, and the students have free use of 
the university library; for registration in the university and for the different exam- 
inations there is no fee required. 
The university also has a fund for the poor and industrious student. It is for the 
student himself to decide which course of lectures or studies he intends to pursue, 
and there is no special supervision of such studies, but by addressing himself to 
the professors he can obtain the requisite advice and guidance, and for the second 
year suggestions as to the plan of study. Most of the students employ a private 
tutor, from whom, as a rule, they obtain one hour’s instruction a day. Five or six 
students join together in these lessons, and each one gives the tutor, or coach, about 
12 crowns ($3.21) each month. 
Students generally enter the university from 17 to 18 years of age, and remain ~ 
usually from 5 to 6 years, although in this period is reckoned the time employed in 
preparing for the philosophical examination. The number preparing for this can 
hardly be determined, but about 400, it is thought. 
The grade of doctor of laws can be acquired by the candidat juris upon the pre- 
sentation of a legal thesis on a subject chosen by the canditate, which, if satisfac- 
tory to the faculty, is published, and is publicly delivered and defended by the stu- 
dent desiring the honors. The degree is only conferred upon those who have thus 
shown themselves to be qualified, and it is conferred upon them by the faculty with 
the consent of the minister of public instruction and ecclesiastical affairs. The 
possession of the doctor’s degree gives the right to hold public lectures in that 
special branch of the university faculty. 
It may be stated here that there are various special institutions in which instruc- 
tion is imparted in a special class of juridical study. For instance, land laws in 
the higher agricultural schools, laws appertaining to military affairs, maritime Las 
the laws of nations [international law] in the military schools, etc. 
An ordinance of June 25, 1875, accorded to women academic rights, 
with the privilege of obtaining any degree except that of theology. 
They have not the right, however, to receive university scholarships or 
pecuniary aid from the State. In attendance upon the courses in the 
university were several Danish ladies, the philosophical and medical 
“courses being the-most sought after by women. In 1890 there were 
            iS

eleven women who passed creditable examinations, and one woman 
graduate received a gold medal for answering the historical prize ques- 
tions, and has since been appointed assistant in the historical depart- 
ment of the Royal Archives. Others have taken up medical practice 
in Copenhagen. : 
The “Polytekniske Laereanstalt,” or polytechnic school, has a com- 
plete course of instruction, the main branches pursued being mathe- 
matics, descriptive geometry, physics, chemistry, mineralogy, geognosy, 
science of agriculture, mechanics, surveying, machine construction, 
making of dykes, road-making, irrigation, mining, ete. 
SCHOOL MANAGEMENT AND METHODS OF DISCIPLINE. 
The school authorities of Denmark have laid down very few rules for 
themanagement of schools. Teachers are left quite free to develop the 
best methods to be employed, and, as a general rule, are permitted to fol- 
Jow out their own inclinations in their schools. The methods of teaching 
and the choice of text-books are generally left to the teacher, and 
equal freedom is allowed in the formation of programmes for the school, 
although it is understood that the course of studies designated by the 
teacher must be approved by the local school board, which, according 
to law, arranges the school programmes and selects the classical text- 
books. In the matter of study and recitation equal liberty of action is 
left to the teacher; in the country districts he is expected to have 
charge of at least 246 recitation hours a year, either in the one school 
~ to which he may be attached or in the ambulatory schools. Pupils 
receive marks for each recitation, 6 being the highest. At the close of 
each month the added marks show the standing of the pupil, and indicate 
his standing for the month to come. Monthly reports are given in the 
higher classes, however, and this daily marking system is discontinued. 
' Regulations are, however, rigorously enforced as to attendance of — 
pupils; parents are fined if their children are absent, and may be fined 
even if it is only for a half-day absence, providing there is no satisfa¢- 
tory excuse for it. Children also may be punished for absence or other 
fault, by depriving them of recreation hours, or by four strokes of the 
ruler, the limit allowed by law. A class journal—for in some if not all 
schools such a journal is kept as a record of daily events—has a record 
of pupils punished with one stroke for having replied when not interro- 
gated, and of four strokes for dipping paper in ink and throwing it on 
the floor. 
Pupils are promoted from class to class in city schools by an annual 
examination, in the presence of the communal school director—one or 
two of the pastors, some of the teachers, and the parents. In rival 
schools an examination is held at the close of six months in the presence 
of the local school board and the pastor.

SCHOOL ORGANIZATION. 
In regard to the organization of schools, the Government carly took 
action, for, according to the school law of 1814, it was decided that each 
district or parish should be provided with a sufficient number of suit- 
able school buildings for all practical purposes. Owing to the im- 
possibility of rapidly erecting such buildings as were required the 
schools were divided into two sections, according to the age and intel- 
Jectual development of the children, one section for children knowing 
how to read and write, who frequented the schools from 8 to 1 o’clock, 
the other from 1 to 5 o’clock. A quarter of an hour was given to 
ventilation and to preparations for entering and leaving sch@gol. Each 
class was to have forty pupils. This arrangement had its defects, as 
the school desks suited to 15-year-old children would assuredly not 
do for 9-year-old children, but it permitted the people to encourage 
strict school attendance without causing any financial embarrassment ~ 
to a country which had had its commerce ruined and its resources ex- 
hatsted by war and territorial dismemberment. - 
The school groups commence with the schools for little folks, which 
are mixed schools of children from 7 to 9 and sometimes 10 years of 
age, who-are given about four hours’ instruction by women teachers, as 
a preparation for the second division of elementary grades. Coeduca- 
tion is not common in schools above that age, the diversity of studies 
not permitting the two sexes to be instructed together. The public 
- school, almueskoler, comprises the school for boys and that for girls 
and has as director an instructor, who is called an inspector. He really 
is the pedagogical director and administrator of the two schools, lodges 
in the building, and goes from one to the other for the control of lessons, 
He has, ordinarily, from 18 to 24 hours of class work each week. He 
usually controls about 20 male and as many female teachers, and 
his salary in city schools is about $772. It is only since 1867 that 
women teachers have been allowed to teach in these schools, and it is 
only about twelve years since they have taken charge of classes of girls. 
A vice-inspectress, who has a lodging in addition to salary, has the 
general care of the building as far as order and discipline are concerned. 
She receives $424 and has 36 hours of recitation each week. The schools 
are closed throughout Denmark on Saturday afternoon, and each day 
has its three recreations, two of ten minutes and one of twenty minutes. 
The school hours in summer are from 8 to 11, in the morning, and 
from 1 to 4 in the afternoon; in winter from 9 to 12 in the morning and 
from 1 to 4 in the afternoon. 
The school buildings are large and well ventilated. They are pro- 
vided, as in Norway and Sweden, with furnaces, class rooms, halls for 
gymnastics, a director’s study, where he can look over the work of the 
pupils. Bylaw of March 8,1856, the class rooms must be so constructed 
as to give:90 cubic feet of space for each child,.and 2 meters 48 centi- 
   
-P-A-G-E-566
            538 : EDUCATION 
meters in height for each child. In Odense and other places there are 
special gardens set apart for women teachers. The schools of Odense, a 
_ city of 25,000 inhabitants, while they differ from the ordinary type, are 
worthy of description, as the school buildings, the school supply, ete., 
indicate what the Danes desire for their youth. ‘The schools are divided 
into two distinct groups situated apart from each other. The boys’ 
schools consist of three large isolated buildings upon the sides of an 
immense court planted with trees. At the entrance of the court is a 
pavilion oceupied by the communal director or inspector. One of the 
buildings is frequented by elementary pupils from 9 or 10 to. 14 years 
of age, each class having 36 pupils. One room is arranged for the 
teaching of the sciences, three lines of desks in a semicirele surround- 
ing the master’s desk, so that all the pupils can follow the experiments 
and demonstrations equally well. Around the room are glass cases 
with natural history collections, collections of plants and animals of 
_ the country, maritime products, skeletons, herbariums, minerals, ete.; 
instruments for physics, a chemical laboratory, globes, and geographic 
apparatus. The classes succeed each other in this room, the teacher 
always having“near at hand whatever material may be needed for the 
instruction to be given. Each session of this school has 650 pupils. 
Opposite is the infant school, where 250 little folks are distributed in 
groups of 24, or 30 at the most, under the charge of instructresses. The 
third building is a large gymnastic hall provided with suitable ap- 
paratus for Swedish exercises. Older pupils meet there on specified 
days for military exercises, fencing, and gymnastics. In another quar- 
ter the school for girls, organized in about the same manner, has a 
school for skilled handiwork attached to it. All the classes have in- 
structresses directing them. On the lower floor is a room for recrea- 
tion for stormy days. The furnace has electric apparatus connected 
with it, so that each teacher can regulate the heat for the classes; a 
bath and douche arrangements are noticeable, and the regulations 
are such that each day 120 young girls receive a five-minutes’ douche, 
a bathwoman aiding them. A similar arrangement for boys is in prep- 
- aration for the winter months. For nearly a century natation has been 
obligatory as a school exercise, and it takes the place of gymnastics in 
the summer time. Each school group has about 600 pupils in it. 
The schools of Copenhagen are so organized that, except in the ele- 
mentary classes, not more than 30 or 40 pupils are found in a class, and 
no school with one teacher is allowed to have more than 100 pupils. 
As soon as it is found that in crowded districts there are more than 
100 pupils, a supplementary school or Biskole is established. The 
teacher of this school can employ, with consent of the authorities, a 
person who may be studying for a teacher’s position, or he may employ 
an ambulatory teacher or Omgangslerer, who serves in three or four - 
schools during the year. The free schools, Friskoler, in cities are or- 
ganized similarly to the rural schools; the pay schools haverusually a 
 
-P-A-G-E-567

higher grade of instruction and more regular attendance of pupils. In 
the free schools the pupils are only half-day pupils; in the pay school 
there are six to seven hours a day instruction in some schools and four to 
five hours in so-called half-day schools. The school fees in the pay 
schools amount to 24 cents a month in Copenhagen. 
The furniture of the schools is limited to that which is most necessary, 
The desks are constructed for two persons, with seats having backs. 
The teacher occupies a slightly raised platform, with a blackboard in 
his rear,” This board is divided into two parts, one plain for ordinary 
use, the other ruled, and used exclusively for drawing and geometrical 
problems. The abacus is used, however; there are natural history 
plates, anatomical, zodlogical, and botanical pictures and collections, 
Biblical pictures, apparatus for physics, ete. In the schools for girls 
there are sewing machines, gas stoves, ironing boards, and models 
(Schallenfeld method) for instruction-in manual training. - This method, 
which not only gives technical skill but insists upon mental develop- 
ment, is applied from class to class, the pupils being given to understand 
what each step in advance signifies. In Copenhagen a normal course 
in the Schallenfeld method of manual training has developed 58 in- 
structresses for such teaching. j 
A decree of January 27, 1860, fixed 240 days as the minimum school 
term, although the length of the school term is generally left to the 
separate school. boards. a 
SUPPLEMENTARY INSTITUTIONS. 
Libraries and musewms.—Students who desire to advance in special 
branches have the use of the library of the University of Copenhagen, 
which contains about 550,000 volumes and 30,000. manuscripts, and 
is particularly rich in Sanscrit and Singhalese collections. Copen- 
hagen has also many museums:-a royal museum of natural history, 
which is rich in zoological and mineralogical specimens; a museum of 
northern antiquities, which is unrivaled in its way; the Thorwaldsen 
Museum of Sculpture, and a royal gallery of paintings by the best 
masters. : 
Societies which aid educational progress.—There are also many so- 
cieties, as Copenhagen is a noted center of literature, science, and art— 
among them a literary and scientific association, an academy of fine 
arts, and the royal society for northern antiquities. Among the societies 
which may be classed as educational is the society for domestic in- 
dustry, which, founded in 1873, has as its object the employment of leisure 
hours in a useful and practical manner, and which is the parent of several 
local societies for that purpose and also schools for children and young 
people. By means of public expositions and prizes, by conferences, 
by the presentation of good models and descriptions of the same, 
and by the formation of a special corps of instructors it has been 
quite successful in its works. The society receives an annual subsidy —

from the state. During the vacation periods, six weeks’ courses are 
formed, under the patronage of the minister of public instruction, and 
these serve for the instruction of teachers of both sexes in various kinds 
of manual training, such as carpentering, brushmaking, bookbinding, 
straw work, sculpture, polishing, cowing, and cutting. The central 
school of this society is presided over by M. Clauson-Kaas, who was 
one of the founders of the society, and who is also in charge of a central 
institute for progress in manual training. 
The “Dansk Sléjdforening,” which issued its first report in°1886 and 
its fifth in 1890, presents models for “Sléjdskoler” or manual training 
schools. according to the Aksel Mikkelsen system. Its laws indicate 
that its object is to engraft manual training on the schools from the 
highest to the lowest grade as a means of both hygienic and pedagogi- 
eal development for the youth of the country. The association is to 
work with the teacher and the parent to see that models, plans, books, 
ete., are furnished for the purpose of progress in manual training. 
Membership in the association for/life is accorded persons of both sexes 
who pay $26.80, while $1.07 covers the annual dues. The course in 1886, 
presided over by Aksel Mikkelsen, was followed by twelve men and six 
women, who were occupied from 7-to 11 o’clock with Sléjd instruction, 
from 1 to 2 o’clock lectures, 2 to 6 Slojd, 6 to 7 o’clock drawing. The 
report for 1887 indicates that at least twenty schools had availed them- 
selves of the society’s material for Sléjd training. Several schools re- 
ported to the association as to the great value of the instruction given, 
among them private and public schools of both lower aid higher grade. 
In the year 1888 there were 46 schools reporting Sléjd courses, which 
ineluded lectures, skilled handiwork, drawing, ete. The number of 
pupils taking Sliéjd courses by some one of the systems in vogue was 
2,000 at that date. An increase to 59 schools in 1889 was observable. 
Included in the instruction given were sawing, cutting, planing, filing, 
tenon-sawing, chiseling, cornice planing, use of the gimlet and auger, 
mortise joining, etc. “The report for 1890 of the “Dansk Sléjdforening” 
indicated that the efforts of the society to introduce Slojd training in the 
schools was meeting with success, for the school budget contained an 
item of $4,368 for the introduction of S1éjd in the schools, and the reso- 
lutions adopted by the members of the society in November, 1890, show: 
the intention of the society to introduce this branch in the country 
schools. The Government also instituted a “Dansk Sléjdlererskele” 
for the preparation of teachers of this branch. 
The “Studentersamfundets Aftenundervisning for Arbejdere” was 
established in 1883, for the purpose of aiding the working classes to 
carry out any’ matured wishes for an advanced educational training. 
The limit of age was fixed at from 16 to 18 years, but this was after- 
wards changed, and the course, in 1888, included persons of 23 and 25 
~ years of age. The studies pursued were writing (ordinary and fancy), 
grammar, arithmetic, bookkeeping, German, English, mathematics, 
‘

free-hand drawing, French, and gymnastics. The largest ane of 
workmen attended the German, English, and arithmetic classes, while 
a few students had instruction in morals, physics, Danish litera- 
ture, history, chemistry, geography, and natural history. The instruc- 
tion was, however, not limited to these branches, for the programme 
included geology, science of laws, political economy, history of art, 
social economics, the Portuguese language, and gymnastics. The num- 
“ber of persons following these courses was as follows for the different 
years: 1,011 in 1886; 906 in 1887; 715 in 1888; 689 in 1889. The object 
of the society is, according to the statutes, to aid the working classes 
to obtain such knowledge as will fit for practical life. The member- 
ship is active, passive, honorary, and for life, the fees for life member- 
ship being $13.40. Annual meetings of the members are held, the date 
of which meetings is published in the daily press. The income of the 
society in 1888-89 was $1,889. The expenditure was $1, 184, leaving 
$705 on hand towards the next year’s expenses. 
Among those who ayailed themselves of this evening instruction 
were bookbinders, barbers, brushmakers, gardeners, lithographers, 
mechanics, coppersmiths, photographers, piano- workers, porters, zinc- ~~ 
workers, lnolesmnt Gis telegraph operators, cashiers. In fact, nearly all 
trades were represented, and the advantage of the workings of such a 
society was evidently recognized by all classes. 
The “Asylselskab,” or society for the establishment of asylums, 
created the first asylum for children in 1835 in Copenhagen. Between 
that date and 1842 three others were created. Allof these have been in 
charge of the society since that date and haye not received any subsidy 
from the department of public instruction, because that department 
does not extend its jurisdiction to children under 7 years of age. , These 
four asylums have sufficed for all children less than 7 years of age, 
until of late years other similar places where-little folks can be cared 
tor have been established in the suburbs of Copenhagen. 
From December 1, 1835, until June, 1885, these infant asylums had 
taken care of 19,874 children. Each building is divided into several 
halls furnished with desks of six places or with long tables having 
seats with backs. Then there is a court or playroom furnished with 
benches, tables, and a harmonium or piano, also a court yard for reerea- 
tion, a room for laying aside wraps, and a kitchen. The little ones 
have exercises in singing, skilled handiwork, such as knitting, folding 
cloth, weaving, then reading and writing for the larger children, sing- 
ing psalms, a commencement of religious exercises, and object lessons. 
Lady members of the society come and give instruction. The directress, 
who occupies the first story of the building, has the general charge of 
the asylum. At Fredericia, the Dagmar asylum is: under the patron- 
age of the Empress of Russia, who gives annually $115.80 towards its 
maintenance. A private society also has charge of this asylum, which 
receives from 120 to 150 children. Theattendance is quite irregular, : 7 EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM OF DENMARK. Be EE

.yarying from year to year. At Odense there are several asylums sup- 
ported by the municipal authorities. 
Education of the special classes.—Included under this head are the 
blind, deaf and dumb, idiots, and, in Copenhagen, the deformed. In- 
stitutions for these different classes are either national or subsidized, 
and are under the direction or control of the Minister of Public Instrue- 
tion. The instruction given in such institutions limits itself generally 
to that of an elementary character with the elements of a professional 
education. : 
For the blind there is a large establishment at Copenhagen situated 
in the midst of extensive grounds, where all the blind of the country 
can easily be taken care of. For thirty years this institution has been 
under the charge of M. Moldenhawer, a distinguished specialist and 
educator. The age of the hundred or more children who are in his care, 
_is from 8 to 18, and so agreeable are the arrangements made, that 
even with the deprivation of sight, all seem happy and joyous. The 
main effort of the teacher seems to be to prepare them to live according 
to normal methods and to care for themselves, instead of giving them 
special training in any one direction. The mode of life is that of a 
boarding school. 
The instruction comprises religion, Danish language, arithmetic, writ- 
ing, geography, history, natural history, physical sciences, geometry, 
drawing, singing, instrumental music, and manual training. The meth- 
ods of teaching do not differ from those employed in ordinary schools, 
except in writing and reading. The punctured letters of Braille are 
used, but Roman letters are also employed so as to give the pupils better 
opportunities for carrying on ordinary correspondence with persons 
who are not blind. In the matter of music, those who show themselves 
~ especially apt pupils are developed as organists and ‘piano tuners. A 
certain amount of instruction is given in both vocal and instrumental 
music. Special attention is given to gymnastics. Natation is substi- 
tuted, however, in the summer, and a part of each day is given to man- 
ual training. In the first two years form and dimension are taught by 
means of cutting, modeling, ete. Each child, so far as is possible, is 
allowed to follow its natural bent. The boys generally incline to the 
making of brushes, weaving, straw plaiting, shoemaking, etc.; the 
girls learn to sew, knit, to weave, and to make brushes. Thus both 
sexes are being prepared to earn their own living after leaving the in- 
stitution; and added to this skilled handiwork they have their musical 
studies, which often help to add to a regular salary obtained by other 
methods. 
The deaf mutes are divided into two classes, those who are born deaf, 
and consequently have no knowledge of sound, and those who have be- 
come deaf, but axe familiar with methods of speech. The former are 
sent, to the Royal Institute at Fredericia, thé others taught at the 
expense of the state or communal authorities in the Keller institutions ~

  in Copenhagen. Still others who are capable of being instructed by 
the sign method are placed ina third State institution. Theinstitution — 
at Fredericia was opened on August 1, 1881, and its construction was 
according to the most modern methods, the arrangements, both hy- — 
gienically and pedagogically considered, being most admirable. It is 
surrounded by large wooded grounds, and is situated high above the 
sea, overlooking Fionie, Jutland, etc. Like the institution of the 
blind, it is opened to both sexes, and with its annex, which contains 
four classes, it instructs 240 pupils of from 8 to 16 years of age. The 
instruction is purely oral; that is, accord ng to the articulation method, 
the pupils.and teachers conv erse with each other, read aloud, ete. hee 
nually, in the month of August, pupils are AS before the minister 
of public instruction for examination, the result of which is to class 
them for the year to come. The life here is that of a day school; 
but certain pupils who have had no advantages are placed among 
those of 6 to 8 years, and for two years they remain with the institu- 
tion; after that all are treated as day pupils and are placed, two, 
three, and four at a time, in families in the town, where they are 
treated like members of the household. These day pupils live the life 
of those who have a normal development, and endeavor to habituate 
themselves to all ordinary avocations of the people around them. At8- 
A.M. they reach the institute and stay till 11; they then go to their 
homes, attending to errands, shopping, and the like for their adopted 
parents while en route; at 1 o’clock they are back again. at school, where 
they remain till 4, The expenditures per pupil are about $53 for eleven 
months of the year. The budget of the institution is about $18,335, 
The course of study includes religion, Danish language, reading, writing, 
arithmetic, natural history, which includes geography and a general | 
knowledge of the earth’s surface, national history, gymnastics, and 
manual training. The instruction in these different branches is entirely 
according to the articulation method. This tends greatly towards 
the intellectual development of the children, and toward fitting them 
for mingling, with others after graduation from the institution. The 
instruction in manual training has no professional aim, but consists 
simply in papier-maché work, wood carving, sculpture, working in the 
gardens, cutting, knitting, etc. Methods of instruction employed in 
other institutions for deaf mutes are not presented; they doubtless do 
not differ greatly from the plan at Fredericia. 
The education of idiots is undertaken in institutions which were 
established in Copenhagen in 1865 by Prof. I. Keller as philanthropic 
institutions, and which have since received subsidies from the state, 
which also grants many scholarships. The brothers Keller carry on 
a number of asylums, hospitals, and educational institutions, which 
received in 1887 about 170 deaf mutes and 459 idiots, who were either 
imbecile or epileptic. The idiots are classified in two sections, one for 
those who are susceptible of being educated, and the other for those 
whose capacity for education is undergoing test. The number of per- 
 
-P-A-G-E-572
    544 EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
sons in these two sections is 231; of these 154 are boarders and 77 day 
pupils. -The 231 are distributed in five boarding establishments superin- 
tended by seven plejemédre, or matrons, who are under the superintend- 
ence of an administrator, Dr. Chr. Keller, and a pedagogical director. 
The pupils are distributed in different classes; those capable are sup- 
posed to acquire the most indispensable branches, and to familiarize 
themselves with various matters appertaining to housekeeping, and with 
certain industrial employments which may be of aid to them in the 
future. The Keller enterprise has three distinct divisions: the school 
of preparation, or it might be called.of examination, which aims to find 
out what the children are capable of; the school of practice, and the 
school of theory. The preparatory classes often receive pupils who 
remain several years in them, all the exercises tending to develop the 
senses, to reform the mode of speech, to train the pupils so as to 
develop habits of civilization, and to give them an idea of the more 
ordinary acts of life, and of the simplest interests in life’s pathway. 
If there is no latent germ to be developed then the pupil is sent among 
the ineurables; if otherwise, he enters the schools of practice or theory. 
In this earliest stage of effort to instruct, lessons are given in articula- 
tion, in language, in form, color, numbers, sounds, object lessons, ex- 
ercises preparatory to writing and reading, manual training and domes- 
tic instruction, gymnastic movements, singing, and games, the whole 
instruction extending over 36 hours a week of 45 minutes aati The 
lessons of activity, so called, are to show the child how to care for his 
person, to serve himself at meals, to carry water, to brush, to lay the 
cloth and dishes on the table, to fill a bottle with water, and divers other 
similar acts which will or may serve to show how capable he is of learn- 
ing ordinary things. 
Those who pass into the practice school are divided into two groups, 
viz, those who are susceptible of intellectual and moral development, 
and those who can learn how to conduct themselves in the ordinary 
avocations of life and possibly become useful in some occupation. To 
follow out such method, the school of practice is divided into two sec- 
tions, the study class with its elementary, secondary, and superior 
courses, and the work class. 
The study class is instructed in the following branches, the figures 
showing the number of lessons a week.

The working classes omit reading, writing, arithmetic, but include _ 
object lessons, singing, language exercises, lessons as to the taking 
eare of themselves, domestic employment, etc. The pupils who in the 
preparatory division have-shown themselves intelligent enough to re- 
ceive an ordinary education are passed into the theoretical classes, 
where the instructors watch over them with the greatest care and teach 
them in the simplest manner, such lessons as bear upon reading, writ- 
ing, arithmetic, drawing, religion, history, geography, natural and in- 
dustrial products, the idea being to develop the pupil intellectually and 
morally, while incidentally imparting a certain degree of positive knowl- 
edge. The guiding principle is to teach the child only what is within 
his capacity. ‘ 
The division of studies is as follows:

_ The pupils also occupy themselves daily with work in weaving, carpen- 
ter work, and brush making; the girls have mending, cutting, knitting, 
and domestic work. This methodical plan of instruction is such that 
the institutions have for twenty years merited the confidence of the 
State and of different families, and such that two-thirds of the persons 
confided to the brothers Keller have been reclaimed from a life of im- 
becility. 
Another school, that for maimed or deformed children, was established 
25 years ago in Copenhagen, and has given instruction and the means 
of existence to 2,054 children since that date. A private society has 
charge of this school, but its president is M. Koefoed, secretary to the 
King’s private council. The aim of this society is to take charge of 
children who are deformed or maimed and to care for them in the best 
possible manner; they are furnished bandages, splints, crutches, arti- 
ficial limbs, ete., and to the age of 18 years are given an elementary 
education, and are placed in the way to care for themselves after that 
age. At first admission was restricted to residents of Copenhagen, 
but later the maimed from all parts of Denmark were admitted. In 
order to examine as to the admission of persons suffering from dis- 
ease, injury, ete., four physicians form a special clinic which is open

daily for the gratuitous examination as te the bodily infirmities of 
children brought before it. The plan of the society is not to give in- 
struction to such children, but to place them in private institutions, 
among children of a normal growth, the expenditures for such instruc- 
tion being defrayed by the city of Copenhagen from the budget for ele- 
mentary instruction. In a professional school the girls, deprived per- 
haps of an arm or hand, are taught to sew, mend, embroider, crochet, 
“and knit; the boys make rugs, mattresses, shoes, woven slippers, chil- 
dren’s toys, brushes, and baskets. A few draw, engrave, paint upon 
porcelain, do watchmaking, and in other ways prepare themselves to 
earn a livelihood. Some of the girls obtain positions as cashiers. 
Twice a day women from outside come in and give instruetive and 
amusing lectures which are listened to attentively by the unfortunates. 
This professional school is subsidized by the ministry of public in- 
struction, and is reported to have been of great help to the class of 
children who were unfortunately deformed from birth or were suffering 
from injury received at an early period of their existence. 
SUMMARIZATION AND FUTURE POSSIBILITIES. 
A general survey of the school system of Denmark clearly shows that 
the people of that kingdom are cognizent of the best methods of thor- 
oughly training both body and mind, for they donotlimitthemselves tothe 
theoretical, but take a foremost rank on the practical side of a rational 
education. Of late years they have studied the subject of coedu- 
cation, as well as the more thorough education of women for teachers’ 
positions, but as yet little progress has been made in these particulars. 
As in Sweden and Norway the subject of school reform in the various 
grades is under discussion, and a writer in the pedagogical journal, 
Vor Ungdom, earnestly urges a revision of the elementary school plan, 
soas to have the children attend regularly all day schools in rural 
districts, rather than the half-day or every-other-day schools now 
found in many places.. Coeducation is also advocated, as is also the 
introduction of drawing, physics, mathematics, and English in three 
elass elementary schools which are to take the place of the two class 
schools now found in rural districts; an important part of his plan is, 
however, not the development of intellectual instruction in elementary 
schools, but the addition of a higher and more practical division to 
this proposed elementary school. He would have the children enter 
this higher division at 14 years of age, and there follow a two-years’ 
curriculum. The practical instruction would consist of farming and 
the tending of domestic animals, a farm with a model garden and bee- 
hives being attached to each school, so that all children should receive 
instruction in gardening and in bee culture. Natural history is to be 
taught in the lower division of the school by means of plants and in- 
sects of the adjoining fields. The writer’s idea is that interest in hor- 
 
-P-A-G-E-575
  EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM OF DENMARK. 547 
ticulture, a taste for orderly homes, and a development of the artistic 
sense will be the natural result of this plan, nor would he neglect p "ac- 
tical instruction in Sléjd or other domestic industries, for he would 
have the children taught to make rakes, wheelbarrows, benches, stools, 
portable steps, hencoops, and beehives, and the use of various tools, 
ete. He also urges the need of more instruction in domestic industries 
in rural schools rather than so much teaching of pedagogical Sléjd. 
This he advocates from an economic standpoint. Bookkeeping ees 
other subject to be introdticed, and the school farm is also to be a model 
farm. ; é 
For some time the tendency in the Scandinavian countries has been 
to increase and extend the intellectual subjects in elementary grades, 
and to model those grades on the secondary schools, without. taking 
into consideration the various positions which the children will occupy 
in after life, consequently the writer hopes that these suggestions come 
at an apropos time. 
At the present time the association of private secondary ae ite 
Copenhagen is engaged in facilitating the passing of private teachers 
from private into publi€Schools. This association considers that many : 
of the best teachers begin their school career in private schools in Co- 
penhagen, where the salary on which they start is higher, and where 
more private lessons out of school are to be obtained than in the small 
provincial towns, where most of the public governmental state schools 
are located. The association has forwarded an address to the Govern- 
ment and the Rigsdag, proposing that teachers of ten years’ service at 
private schools on obtaining a teachership at governmental schools 
shall at once be entitled to the same privileges and to the same salary 
as public school teachers after four years’ service. :

EDUCATION IN EUROPE AND AMERICA 
Showing (a) whal portion of the population is enrolled in school; (b) the expenditures

or not. 
  INTRODUCTION. 
The accompanying charts and diagrams are a continuation of a sys- 
tematic comparison, commenced in the Annual Report of 1888-89, Part 
I, pages 75-78, showing the sum total of educational efforts in Europe 
and Pan-America between kindergarten and univer: sity. 
Various lines of inquiry were pointed out last year as standards 
of comparison, but for reasons then stated only one was applied, 7. e., 
“What portion of the population of each nation in Europe and Aerie 
is under school influence?” This year the inquiry is extended to two 
other questions, 7. e., “What is the cost of elementary instruction per 
capita of the population?” and “Is elementary instruction gratuitous, 
or is a tuition fee charged?” It will be seen that while most of the 
blanks which appeared in last year’s tables are filled this year, new - 
blanks oceur in the new columns. It is to be hoped that they will dis- 
appear as quickly as those of last year. 
While the diagrams illustrating the tables last year, by veveeaabil ng 
the population of each country by means of a square, were welcomed 
by those who evinced an interest in comparative statistics, it is confi- 
dently hoped that the new diagrams, in which the bar is employed, will 
be considered an improvement. This mode of presentation requires 
the eye to measure only one dimension (length), and hence will be 
preferable to the square, which necessitates the eye to measure both 
Jength and breadth. 
The diagrams are duplicated, No. T shows ing a bar of 100 per cent, 
representing the entire population, within which bar the ratio of children 
enrolled in school is'shaded; while in No. IL a bar of only 30 per cent 
is given, representing the ideal ratio of youth of school age (or very 
nearly so) and the portion of these actually enrolled, thereby revealing 
the two facts, ¢. ¢., the number of youth who are under school influence 
as well as the Parnes of those who ought to be.

Tn the result of this inquiry we have systematically excluded from 
the count all institutions such as “infant schools” and “kindergartens,” 
because they represent the prescholastic age. Also excluded are all 
professional schools, such as universities, polytechnical, medical, pharma- 
ceutical, and art schools, conservatories of music, in fact, all special 
schools except normal schools, net because the latter are not special 
and professional schools, for they are, and needs must be, but because 
they are not sufficiently designated as special schools in the statistical 
material at hand. 
This then brings the age, commonly called “school age,” within the 
years 6 and 18 (or 20). These limits are not in all cases and in all 
nations the same, which may account for a small percentage of differ- 
ence in the number of enrolled children.. Again, the sum total stated 
for Great Britain and Ireland does not contain the number of secondary 
students, while they are included in nearly all other countries. Sec- 
ondary instruction being entirely left to private enterprise in England, 
it is not possible to obtain reliable statistics concerning it. It would 
be but just to add from 14 to 2 per cent to the ratio given in order to 
place Great Britain and Ireland on a similar basis with European con- 
tinental countries. But aside from little unavoidable diserepancies and 
possible errors, these tables and diagrams reveal facts which invite the 
most earnest attention. | i 
With regard to the new columns: (a) Cost per capita, and (b) Tuition 
fee paid or not? itis regretted that the officials of some countries do 
not report the amount of expenditures by provincial and local authori- 
ties, and only state the amount paid by the central governments. These 
items were inserted rather than leave blanks. But they are marked 
thus (*), which means from state only. 
The tables are printed in triplicate by arranging the countries (a) 
according to the alphabet; (b) according to the population ; (e) according 
to the ratio. This is done to facilitate comparison. This Bureau will 
_ be grateful if errors ef omission or commission are pointed out in the 
accompanying tables, and enlists the aid of all who are interested in 
comparative statistics of this kind in completing and perfecting the 
tables. ' =

  INTRODUCTION, 
The authors of “Minerva, Jahrbuch der Universitiiten der Welt,” 
which is the chief source of information offered in the following four 
lists, say that they have submitted their work at various stages of 
completion to different professors of the countries mentioned, so that 
they are assured that their decision as to which of the learned institu- 
tions of the world should be regarded as universities is upheld by the 
most trustworthy authority. They call their “Jahrbuch” a collection 
of names of teaching bodies of universities or similar institutions of the 
world. The authors, however, admit that, despite the most rigorous 
search, a few of the smaller institutions on the Western Hemisphere 
escaped their notice. Since this Report of the Bureau of Education 
contains direct information concerning the superior institutions of the 
United States, the latter have been omitted from the following lists:

CHAPTER XVIII. 
SOCIAL PATHOLOGY AND EDUCATION! 
The term pathology includes the doctrine of disease, its nature and 
, results. Social pathology is intended to be used as a general term and 
refers to any abnormal or to any diseased social conditions. It includes 
pauperism, crime, insanity, feeblemindedness, alcoholism, and in general 
tefers to all classes of individuals who, by mental, moral, or physical 
defects, come to be dependent upon or injurious to society as a whole. 
Such individuals may or may not be responsible for their condition, 
for it may be due to the individual himself or to his surroundings, in- 
herited tendencies, or physical diseases over which he has had no control, 
* The purpose of studying social pathology is not so much ethical as sci- 
entific; that is, it does not undertake to pronounce whether the individual 
or society is to blame for delinquency, dependency, or defectiveness, but 
it seeks to analyze the causes of these abnormal or diseased social con- 
ditions, and in this respect it is a necessary preliminary to the prevention 
or amelioration of patho-social conditions. As education concerns the 
moral, mental, and physical development of individual and society, it 
bears a most intimate relation to those pathological elements that tend 
to social degeneration. Education here is social therapeutics; that is, a 
method of amelioration or prevention. The large number of weaklings 
in will, intellect, and body are cases included under this educative 
treatment. As there is no known “specific” for any of the social dis- 
eases, the general remedy is to implant and develop in individuals (the 
earlier the better) such mental, moral, and physical habits as will serve 
to prevent or lessen tendencies to delinquency, dependency, or defect- 
iveness. Social therapeutics is therefore distinctively educational. 
Itis intended here to give a short account of two recent social schemes. 
One is that of Charles Booth, in his “Labor and Life of the People in 
London,” and may be considered as a basis for the scientific method of 
social education. The other is that of Gen. Booth, and can be called 
the religious and moral method of social education. One is a descrip- 
tion of the evil, its nature and causes; the other is a practical attempt 
to remove the evil. One is the study of the disease and its diagnosis; 
theother is a method of treatment and cure.

A Srupy oF THE SLUMS or LONDON, BY CHARLES BooTu. 
There is little reason to believe that the slums of one city differ 
essentially from those of another. A description of the London slums 
may therefore serve to give a general and trustworthy idea of social 
degeneration, and especially so since Mr. Booth’s investigation is ac- 
knowledged to be the most exact yet made. 
The purpose of Mr. Booth in his investigation of East London is “ to 
show the numerical relation which poverty, misery, and depravity bear 
to regular earnings and comparative comfort and to describe the 
general conditions under which each class lives.” 
The division of the people into eight classes is based upon informa- 
tion obtained from the school board visitors, who make visitations from . 
house to house and give the details of every family with children of 
school age, and the record of those children who lave left school. 
The inhabitants of London (not including 100,000 in charitable and 
penal institutions) may be classified as follows: 
  
j | Number. | Per cong. 
       
      
  Class A (the lowest)..... 37, 610 | 9 Class B (the very poor)... 316,834 TD Classes © and 1) (the poor)... 938, 298 22.3 
Classes E and F (the comfortable worl 2, 166, 503 515 Classes G and H (middle class and all Sua 749, 930 | 17.8 
4,209,170 | 100 
  
The proportions may be shown graphically: 
  * Class A is the lowest and consists of occasional laborers, loafers, and 
semicriminals. They are more a disgrace than a danger. This class is_ 
recruited with adult men from all the others. These recraits have met 
some misfortune and nearly all have lost their characters; their miseries 
are not due to any consciousness of their degradation, for their chief 
desire is to be let alone; their social improvement is in their eyes their 
_ destruction. 
Class B are casual workers and very poor. ‘The laborers of this class:
-P-A-G-E-603
SOCIAL PATHOLOGY AND EDUCATION, oto 
do not average more than three days of work a week, and it is doubt- 
ful if they could or would work longer had they the opportunity. Their 
- ideal is to work and play when they like; they are the “leisure class” 
among the poor; their condition is limited closely by the pressure of 
want and is habitual in the sense of being second nature. They can 
not endure regularity and the ennui of civilization, but find satisfaction 
in street life or trouble at home. Drink is not their special luxury as 
with class A, nor is it a passion as in the case of those with higher 
wages and irregular but severe work. The children of Class B obtain 
employment easily; if they do not earn enough they are liable to be 
turned adrift and may sink into the lowest class, but if industrious 
they may rise. Class B, and especially the labor part of it, consists of 
those who are mentally, morally, and physically incapable of doing 
better work. 
Class CO receive intermittent earnings, and, with class D, who gain 
small regular earnings, constitute what may be called the poor. Class 
C are especially the victims of competition, and present the most 
proper field for systematic charitable assistance. Their passion for 
drink is the most developed. The industrious of this class usually 
need no help. Class ©, with its irregular employment and improvident 
habits, is the most Secdly judged and — of all, yet few of them rank 
with the deserving. 
Class D receive small regular earnings, and are poor. Some become 
poorer with increase of family, but improve as their children become 
able to work. The loss of their older children by marriage is regarded 
by them with jealousy and disfavor. None can be said to rise above 
poverty, unless by the earnings of their children. This class is not 
troubled by its experience of better things, nor by what is expected 
of it, nor by an unattainable ideal; but, like Class C (intermittent 
workers), it can only be helped by a movement which “shall succeed 
in raising the whole standard of life.” 
Olass E receive regular standard earnings, and are by far the largest 
in number. Classes D and E together form the actual middle class. 
The numbers above and below them are nearly equal. The pride of 
this class causes them to resent charity. Their lot is aggravated by 
a raised ideal. Here, rather than the ruffianism of Class A or the 
- starvation of Class B or the wasted energy of Class C or anxieties of 
Class D, they prefer socialism, if not revolution. These spontaneous 
feelings, that naturally arise from such conditions, are far from super- 
ficial or temporary, and can not be stopped by force, for these men have 
little to lose, and so react still more by force. Itis to be regretted that 
this sentiment sometimes goes to extremes, but it can hardly be smoth- 
ered, for it is not confined to any one nation, but seems to be a spon- 
taneous movement in the present stage of human development. 
Class F consists of those engaged in the higher class of labor; they 
are the best paid of the artisans. The foreman of ordinary labor gen- —

erally sees things from the employer’s point of view, while the skilled 
artisan sees them from the standpoint of the employed. In connec- 
tion with this fact it is to be observed that foremen are a more contented - 
body of men than the most prosperous artisans. 
Class G represents the lower middle class, shopkeepers, small em- 
ployers, clerks, ete., and subordinate professional men. 
Class H represents the upper middle class. All aboye Class @ may 
be comprised in one and called the servant-keeping class. 
SOCIAL TOPOGRAPHY OF EAST LONDON.! 
In the poverty of the very poor streets and in most of the lowest 
class streets it is the children and women who show the condition of 
the family most noticeably. The windows and doors of the houses are 
also indicators, the brickwork around each door being black from 
rubbing of hands. Bird fanciers are in the mixed streets nearest the 
lowest districts. Fried-fish and stewed-eel shops and cat-meat shops 
mark the vicinity of the greatest poverty. Another sign of great 
poverty is where bread is seen thrown about. The candy stores are 
the saloons for the children of poverty. Some houses were built for 
those of larger means, and a dwelling intended for one family is arranged 
for two or three or even more families. Such conditions are obviously 
most favorable for the development of crime and immorality. From a 
study of typical streets Mr. Booth shows 5,000 persons to have occu- 
pied less than half a room. Of those who occupy less than half a 
room the majority live three in a room; in a few cases there are as many as 
seven, eight, or nine in one room. Among the poor with intermittent 
earnings (Class E) more than half occupy less than half a room. One- 
fourth of those above poverty (Class I) occupy less than half a room. 
Among those who have higher-elass labor (Class F) there are few who 
have not at least this amount ofspace. There is no special reason for not 
believing but that what is true in regard to these 10,000 people of the 
lowest classes is also true in regard to the whole 3,500,000 of these 
elasses in London. Buildings which are the property of philanthrophi¢ 
and semiphilanthrophic associations—that is, those which do not make 
profit the first consideration constitute nearly all of the best blocks 
where there is a maximum amount of open space and light, and sani- 
tary matters and convenience of tenants is studied. Another class of 
buildings, belonging to large trading companies or private owners, are 
more closely packed, and the lower tenements are generally insuffi- 
ciently lighted. It is obvious from looking at these buildings that the 
main consideration of the architect was not the comfort and welfare of 
the tenants, but the greatest number of apartments or rooms that 
could be built “to let on a given area.” But it may be said in favor of 
capital on a large scale that it can take advantage of sanitation.

“Tt will be seen that, taking this sample as a whole, 5,000 individuals occupy less 
than half a room each and 5,000 occupy half a room or more. Of those who oceupy 
_ less than half a room most live three in aroom. Ofthose whoare less closely packed 
the greatest proportion live two in a room, and next, following closely after, are these 
who occupy one room or more for each person. 
“Taking class by class in the same way we find that the position of A and B is the 
same—three-fourths occupy less than half a room each and one-fourth half a room or 
more. In Class C rather more than half are in the first category, while in Class D it 
is almost exactly half and half. In Class E nearly three-fourths have not less than 
half a room each, while in Class-F there are’ very few who have not this amount of 
space. 
“Tt would be too rash to assume that what is here shown with regard to 10,600 
people of Classes A. to F would be true of the whole 3,500,000 of these classes, but 
‘there is nothing inherently improbable in the supposition.” 
There is a third class of buildings belonging to private unknown 
owners; the blocks are much smaller and most of them unsatisfactory. 
They often are owned by a small local builder, who constructs them as 
cheaply as possible. They have little light and are unsanitary. In gen- 
eral, it may be said that it is only in the worst blocks that the poor are 
accommodated. To supply suitable quarters on business principles is 
too dear for those on or below the line of poverty. To avoid these un- 
salutary dwellings is a problem of the future. Many of the poor prefer 
to live in the most unhealthy tenement house rather than to occupy 
the better buildings, because the rules and regulations are unendurable 
to those accustomed to unsanitary surroundings. 
The advantages in living in buildings are greater than the draw- 
backs. Cheapness, a higher standard of cleanliness, and sanitation 
are attained. There is neighborly intercourse and especially the im- 
possibility of being overlooked altogether er eriminally neglected by 
relatives in illness or oldage. Some of the disadvantages are a want 
of privacy and increased facility for gossip and quarrel, which, how- 
ever, may give a variety of selfish and petty feeling as contrasted with 
the monotony of daily life. , 
INFLUX FROM RURAL DISTRICTS. 
The influx from the country into Londen is mainly an economic move- 
ment, caused partly by the increased facilities of access and by higher 
wages. Much of the work can not be done by those reared in the city 
The countrymen who come are largely the best of the youth, secking 
economic advancement; they are more steady than city-bred youth, aud 
in coming to London receive much morepay. Country or village lifeis 
too uneventful for young men, and in addition the current will flow in 
the direction of higher wages and more expensive living. The decay 
of apprenticeship has gone further in the large centers of population, 
where machinery and division of labor has had greater scope. A large 
majority of those who come to the city are between 15 and 25 years of 
age. London is kept up in bone and sinew by this country element, 
which in the second generation degenerates, showing a lower physical

tone. The third generation is stilllower. The greater part of London. 
poverty and distress ishomemade. The excess of Londoners is chiefly 
in casual and irregular employments, which require no exceptional 
steadiness or strength. 
WOMEN AND GIRLS. 
The position of the married women can only be improved through 
education of the children, especially by moral and industrial training. 
The more intelligent and trustworthy the girl,the more easily can she be 
removed from one branch of work to another, and the less need there is 
that extra hands should be engaged by the employer. 
Among the dock-laboring class are many girls with a low sineee of 
comfort, whose wants are supplied by three days’ wages in the week, 
and who have a natural dislike to steady and continuous work. The 
married women employed in factories seem to have been brutalized, and — 
their influence over young girls in the factory is very much worse than 
when men and girls work together. Many of these girls think that,ex- 
ternals must be kept up, for they regard them as essentials; this is one 
of their ideals for which they stint themselves. Probably every girl in 
the lowest classes in the East End has an opportunity to marry, and 
with few exceptions every girldoes marry. This is not true of the mid- 
dle classes. The girls are rough, boisterous, outspoken, warmhearted, 
and honest in their work; their standard of morality is low, but their 
very tolerance of evil, as is shown by their willingness to subscribe for 
a companion when in trouble, may be one reason why they have such 
a repugnance to the worst forms of immorality. Their great enemy is 
drink, for when they become dock laborers’ wives it draws them down, 
and their children with them, for they are ignorant of every domestic 
accomplishment. 
CONDITION OF SCHOOL CHILDREN. 
The school fees under the London board are fixed according to the 
character of the population, varying from 1d. to 6d. per week; two only 
reach 9d. the limit by law. Twenty per cent of these fees can not be 
collected; 10 per cent of children are attending who are in want of 
food; some come without their breakfast, because parents do not pre- 
pare it; as a little boy said, his mother got drunk and could not get 
up to get it. Such children are very irregular in attendance; this | 
makes many difficulties for the teacher and wastes the public money, 
In such schools the lowest classy predominates; there are 22 such 
schools with 21,000 pupils. These children live in the poorest and 
dirtiest neighborhoods; they have no regular meals; fully a third 
occupy one room with their parents; their waking hours are divided 
between school and the street. In such neighborhoods saloons are 
sometimes as numerous as 1 to every 100 adults, patronized by those 
on the verge of pauperism. Wonderfal order is a striking thing in 
    
fs

these schools; without harsh control the usually turbulent street 
urchins are trained to be industrious and quiet; the little fellows re- 
spond to right rule, which more than anything else gives ground for 
hope in regard to the future of these poor children. At home they 
have no training; they thus need to be encouraged and allowed to 
catch on to something that will lift them out of the slough into which 
they were born, and give them a taste for better things. The personal 
influence of the teachers here is valuable. When an infant is 3 years 
old it may be sent to an elementary school; at 5 the law requires it to 
attend; at 7 it ranks as a boy or girl. Children of the infant classes 
reflect the poverty of their homes less than those in upper depart- 
ments. Besides keeping order the teaching of cleanliness and kinder- 
garten is carried on. At 7 years the code requires that they shall be 
ready for examination for reading from books of more than one syllable, 
spelling, writing, arithmetic as far as addition and subtraction, and 
half the multiplication table. There is needle work for girls and draw- 
ing for boys. In the department above this poyerty and neglect are 
more apparent; the children are dull and backward; many are failures 
from infancy, or are boys just run in from the streets, who may have 
never been in school before. Some of them make a start; they get 
eleaner, but this is the lowest circle; parents hurry their children off. 
to work as soon as the law allows them. 
The difficulty with the children is caused more frequently by poverty. 
and shiftlessness at home than by neglect and vice, altheugh there is 
a heavy tide of the latter as well. - In one of the schools, having the 
~ worst classes, a teacher said that nearly one-fourth of the children have 
bad or drunken homes, two-thirds have their fees remitted, about the 
same number have free meals as often as the funds allow. A full fourth 
on the rolls is seldom in the school. Compulsion, in its ordinary form 
with such children, is practically powerless; to coach these up requires 
the more regular pupils to be neglected. It must be , however, 
that the school work required by the code is neither attractive in itself 
to children nor does it commend itself to the parents as likely to serve 
_a boy or girl much in the struggle for bread. The education is too ab- 
stract for slum boys. Cooking has been started in some of the schools; 
all are fond of it. The deepest and best instinct lying back of every- 
thing in the woman heart, the desire to make home comfortable, is 
reached and brought into play. Training in the domestic artsis the 
best thing that can be given to girls of this class, needful before all else 
if their standard of living is to be raised. Want of purpose is a pre- 
vailing feature in homes of the lower class; these parents seldom think 
of their children’s future; the Jews are an exception; the encourage- 
ment to the children helps them in school. The penny bank is the best 
corrective to habits of self and heedless indulgence, which is the root of 
half the misery of the slums. This penny bank is a common part of 
the scheol machinery. Schools planted where the better-paid men

abound show a distinct advance and cost less per head (£2 14s. 4d.) than 
in the slum districts (£3 6s. 3d. per head). Nothing is more costly to 
the community than a slum child. Many of the poor, as soon as their 
children are through with school, put them on work which prepares 
them for nothing, so that they drift into casual employment, trust to 
chance for a living, marry at 20, and sink to a lower class. The needs 
of the children are traceable to three sources, poverty, neglect, and de- 
feets in the code. As to defects in the code at least 30,000 children of 
the lower classes need the trained habits of decency, cleanliness, and 
eommon self-respect, the rudiments of civilized, social, and domestic 
life. These 30,000 are the raw material out of which, to a large extent, 
the poverty, misery, vice, and crime of the next generation will come. 
The slum child costs the community from £28 to £35 in its school 
stage. 3 
“The education of the code has been technical education of the wrong 
kind, fitting the children for competitive examinations, clerkships, and 
college work, and not for the workshop, engine room, the factory, and 
the home. 
The proportion of pupils in the lowest grade! in poor condition is 
small considering the grade, but the number of dull or delicate children 
is one of the most discouraging facts in the tables. Taking the results 
of the table as a whole, the lowest class (A) is bad throughout; 28 per 
cent of the very poor (B) come to school well cared for, and 21 per cent 
attend irregularly.

      SOCIAL PATHOLOGY AND. EDUCATION. - 583 - 
The improvement is very noticeable after the poor and very poor are 
left out. Attendance, condition, payment of fees, character of parents 
are all on the ascending scale. 
SECONDARY EDUCATION—BOYS, 
Under the existing conditions of industry the vast majority of children _ 
leave school at the age of 12 or 13. The greater majority of boys at- 
tending the secondary schools of London are of the middle and lower 
middle class. 
The experience of junior Sanalerchips open to penny schools shows 
that the offer of free education fails to procure the poor children with 
capacity, where the loss of a boy’s earnings is a serious pinch to the 
family. 
The question is not between a liberal and technical training, for any 
studies must directly or indireetly be bread studies. The unbroken tradi- 
tion of purely literary training, which has been handed down in gram- 
mar schools from the middle ages, must come to an end, as far as the 
slums are concerned. 
SECONDARY EDUCATION—GIRLS, 
What is needed by girls in the working classes is not so much a 
ladder from the gutter to the university as instruction in practical 
domestic. economy and the laws of health, and an acquaintance with 
good literature. By domestic economy is not meant a training neces- 
sary for domestic service. The majority of girls in Hast and South ~ 
London will never be attracted to domestic service, and their home 
needs are of a very different order from those of the servant-keeping 
classes; the problem is to have the children after they have left school 
to come for an hour or two in the afternoon for lessons in cottage cookery, 
house-cleaning, methods of ventilation, washing and ironing, sick- 
nursing, adapted to the requirements of households living under primi- 
tive conditions. These children are only too precocious in a knowledge 
of all that is termed life.. They know evil so well that in offering them 
knowledge we are but introducing them to the good and helping them 
to discern it. We need not fear to put into their hands or to give 
them the key to the works of the great novelists and essayists. 
CONDITION OF LABORERS. 
The multiplication of small masters is a case of economic disease in. 
East London. Competition of the provincial factory causes two diffi- 
culties; it depresses London labor in its best form, that is, the well- 
managed manufactory, and when the trade declines the people stay 
and fall into the category of the unemployed or partially employed 
and provide the mass of cheap labor. 
As to division of labor, the wholesale trade adopts it bee ause it in-

creases the quantity rather than the quality, The model workman is 
one who never has to pause to think what he is doing, but works like 
a machine. Work at home, with aid of family, may succeed if the 
father is kind and not a drunkard. There are many who are willing 
to work, but, lacking energy, can neither obtain work nor keep it; and 
thus the habit of vagrancy develops. The vagabond becomes so con- 
tent with his position in life as not to make efforts to improve. In all 
great cities there is a certain nomad population of habitual wanderers 
crowding philanthropic shelters w ho are to be eanereted from the 
poor and very poor. 
From an investigation of 286 men, 60 were found to be of good char- 
acter, 146 indifferent, and 80 doubtful or bad. The condition of the 
bad is mostly due to drink or gambling. Fifty claimed some profes- 
sion or trade, 95 were skilled laborers, and 141 unskilled. A large 
proportion (116) were in the prime of life. ~ 
The nonindustrial and disorderly classes predominate in the common 
lodging houses; many belong to the very poor and poor classes; some, 
incapable mentally or physically, can not work, or their work is use- 
less; these oscillate between the common lodging houses and the poor 
house. Love of drink is the prevailing passion and is very often due 
to unhappy surroundings: 
My. Booth accepts Classes EH and F, or the comfortable working 
classes, as representing the standard life in England, from which that 
of the classes above or below diverge by some happy or unhappy aecei- 
dent or owing to some cause which requires explanation. This stand- 
ard life—the common Jot of humanity—is continually endangered by 
insecurity, against which it is difficult to guard. One disease from 
which society suffers is the unrestricted competition in industry of the 
needy and helpless. Mr. Booth insists that, while it may seem impos- 
Sible that the state nurse the helpless and incompetent, yet nothing 
less than this will enable self-respecting labor to obtain the full re- » 
muneration and the nation’s standard of life beraised. The difficulty 
lies in inducing or driving these people te accept a regulated life. Mx. 
Booth’s scheme is a limited form of socialism. By taking charge of 
the life of the incapable, state socialism’may find its proper work. 
‘The individualistic system breaks down as things are. Its stern doc- 
trine, however, would have better opportunity of success were the so- 
cial organism purged of those who can not stand alone, State inter- 
ference with a small fraction of the population might ultimately dis- 
pense with any socialistic interference in the lives of all the rest. 
These people should be allowed to live as families in industrial groups 
planted wherever land and building materials are cheap, being taken 
sare of, taught, trained, and employed on government account. They 
should have little or no competition with the outside world, since their 
own lives have already shown their incapacity to maintain themselves 
in a free community, where competition is too strong, and instead of 
developing them, it crushes them

SOCIAL PATHOLOGY AND EDUCATION, 585 
In Class B, or the very poor, 5 per cent of poverty is due to low wages 
and casual or irregular work. In Classes C and D, or the poor, irregu- 
larity of work causes the poverty of 43 per cent, and low pay 25 per 
cent. Drink accounts for 14 per cent of the poverty in the East End, 
as principal cause, but as contributing cause it would be connected with 
a much larger proportion. Deserving men may be idle in the streets, 
but those who descend low enough to ask charitable aid rarely stand 
the test of work, and when it isobtained they rarely keep it. Want of 
employment is not the real trouble. Those out of work are, as a class, 
“the selection of the unfit.” To the rich the very poor are a sentimen- 
tal interest; to the poor they are a crushing load. The poverty of the 
poor is due mainly to the competition with the very poor, who consti- 
tute the main difficulty in the social problem, ~All other classes could 
take eare of themselves if the very poor were out of the way. The 
problem involves the separation of poverty from industry, and it seems 
that the attainment of the solution lies in the elimination of the very 
poor or those with casual earnings, a class industrially valueless and 
socially pernicious. It has been shown that its numbers are not so 
great but that it may be dealt with in some semisocialistic way, which 
will be for the interest of self-supporting labor. It is not expense that 
hinders, but the difficulty of devising any scheme which would not tend 
to increase the numbers to be dealt with. 
Mr. Booth is unprepared to make very definite suggestions, for the 
cireumstances of the very poor are as various as the remedies demanded. 
Having now followed in brief the description of the slums and the 
difficulties of treating them, as given by Mr. Chavles. Booth, another 
scheme, which is the first proposed remedy on a, large scale, may be 
considered, 
Grn. BootH’s SCHEME. 
It is but natural that the scheme of Gen. Booth has attracted 
more attention than the studies of Mr. Charlés Booth. The public 
point of view is intensely practical, and sometimes extreme in thinkin 
that the remedy is the only important question in every malady. Thus 
impatience is often manifested, when a detailed study of the nature and 
cause of a disease is made, before the question of its remedy receives 
attention. ‘The shortsightedness of such a view is evident. 
~ But the direct attempt to remove an. evil, before its causes and na- 
ture have been fully investigated, has some advantages. One is that 
its very application, even if it fails, may reveal these causes. 
General Booth’s remedy is to be recommended for its directness and 
practicality. In addition, it does not rest on any sudden impulse, but | 
is a result of steady growth, in which the life of one man has culmi- 
nated. To understand the individuality that characterizes the move- 
ment, a few facts in the life of Gen. Booth will be in place. 
    
 
-P-A-G-E-614
  586 : EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
Mr. William T. Stead! calls Gen. Booth the George Fox of the nine- 
teenth century. Like Gen. Booth, Fox was a man of great spiritual 
genius and contagious enthusiasm. He illustrates the fact that “Re- 
form is an indispensable adjunct to preaching the Gospel; the Salva- 
tion Army obeys the same law which concerted the turbulent and icon- 
oclastic Quakers of Cromwell’s time, into the cultured leaders in every 
beneficent project of humanitarian and philanthropie endeavor.” The 
charges against Fox in the seventeenth century are similar to those 
made against Booth. f . 
He was called ambitious, his motives were discredited, ete. Gen. 
Booth himself feels a close relation to John Wesley. Between the Qua- 
kers of the seventeenth, the Methodists of the eighteenth, and the Sal- 
vationists of the nineteenth century there is a line of direct succes- 
sion. According to Gen. Booth the Salvation Army represents what 
Wesleyanism would have become had it continued to develop after 
Wesley’s death. Wesley started the poor man’s bank and the poor 
maw’s lawyer and the first medical dispensary for the poor in London. 
Gen. Booth, although baptized in the Church of England, beceme a 
member of the Methodist Church at the age of 15. From the age of 17 
until 32 he was in the hands of the churches. The Wesleyans desired 
to have Booth conform to the established order; he was made a local 
preacher, and did so well that they wanted him to go to college and 
become a regular minister. But not desiring to, he evaded a decision. 
As he could not allow his zeal to be limited by the regulations for local 
preachers, he resigned his position as lay preacher and began his work 
in open air, and for this was expelled from the Wesleyan Methodist So- 
eiety. On advice he joined the Congregationalists and was recom- 
mended to apply for admission to an independent college in order to 
qualify for the Congregational ministry. But he could not accept their 
_ doctrine of a limited atonement, so he gave up this plan. He is subse- 
quently found studying theology for the ministry of the Methodist new 
connection, one of the earliest offshoots from the Wesleyan Church. 
But it was difficult for the young student to follow the theological cur- 
wiculum. He would go to revivals at any cost, and it was a serious 
consideration whether he should not be released from the institution; 
but the fruit of his zeal saved him, and he was finally ordained as a 
regular minister, At this time, curious to say, Mr. Booth shrank from 
the career of an evangelist. But being ordered to take charge of a 
mission, he did it, and his success was so great that he gave his life to 
work of this nature. By a fortunate marriage to one who was thor- 
oughly in sympathy with him in such work, he found a help without 
which his present scheme could have hardly been realized... Mr. Booth 
and his wife conducted a mission at Cornwall, and there a revival be- 
gan which was subsequently followed by the establishment of the Sal- 
vation Army. Hitherto Mr. Booth had preached in chapels and halls, 
1General Booth, by W. T. Stead, London, 1891. 
 
-P-A-G-E-615
    SOCIAL PATHOLOGY AND EDUCATION. 587 
but at Cardiff he made a-change and held services in a cireus. Being 
invited to hold a mission in a large chapel, and not being able to get 
the crowd to come, he made what many would consider a last resort, 
and adopted the star-company method to attract the classes within 
the chapel. A number of the lowest roughs, criminals, prize-fighters, 
ete., who had been convicted of sin and reclaimed were enlisted and 
advertised as the “ Hallelujah Band.” This innovation caused the 
chapel to be filled; it was sufficient to draw other ex-convicts, wife- 
beaters, drunkards, and the like. It may, be said, by way of parenthe- 
sis, that there would be no justification of such a spectacular method 
were it not for the fact that it has geod effect upon the rough and de- 
graded classes. While, doubtless, numbers of so-called converted repro- 
bates fall back, yet some do not; and quite a number, though they fall 
again, are not. so low as they were originally. Aisthetical criticism, 
both from the religious and irreligious, is often based on a misconcep- 
tion and a want of knowledge of the real nature of the slums. 
The success of the “Hallelujah Band” indicated the methed of 
reaching the most degraded. After a hard fight in Leeds, where they 
were pelted and mobbed, Mr, and’ Mrs. Booth came to London, and on 
invitation conducted services in a tent on Baker’s Row, in Whitechapel. 
After the tent was blown down an old dancing-saloon was used, then a 
stable, but it was not until the Effingham Theater was taken that the 
work showed some prospect of permanence. The idea at first was to 
gain converts for the churches; but, converts not being weleomed by 
the churches, Mr. Booth became convinced that a permanent religious 
society was needed to take care of the converts, and here is the real 
beginning of the Salvation Army. But it was a dozen years before it 
became a distinctive and conspicuous movement, which was in 1878, 
The name “Salvation Army” was a happy one; it made the spirit of 
religion more effective through the practical methods of army regula- 
“tions. The history of the Salvation Army from this time on shows a 
steady progress, notwithstanding persecution from almost every quar- 
ter, and at present it has assumed the form of a vast social and relig- 
ious movement; as in the history of the church the striking of the fire 
has scattered the sparks. 
PRINCIPLES UNDERLYING THE SCHEME! 
In the words of Gen. Booth himself, the essentials to a suecessful 
scheme for the elevation of the degraded pauper classes are as follows: 
1. The first essential that must be borne in mind as governing every scheme that 
may be put forward is that it must change the man when it is his character and 
conduct which constitute the reasons for his failure in the battle of life. 
2. The remedy, to be effectual, must change the circumstances of the individual 
when they are the cause of his wretched condition and lie beyond his control, 
3. Any remedy worthy of consideration must be on a scale commensurate with the 
evil with. which it proposes to deal. 
1In Darkest England, pp. 85-89.
-P-A-G-E-616
  588 EDUCATION REPORT, 1889-90. 
. The scheme must be permanent. 
2 It must be immediately practicable. 
. The indirect features of the’ scheme must not be such as to produce injury. to 
‘as persons whom we seck to benefit. 
7. While assisting one class of the community, it must not seriously interfere with 
the interests of another. 
THE SCHEME. 
The insane, the criminals, and the indoor paupers are cared for in a 
way, but in addition to these there are those who live on the verge of 
despair, if not in degradation; they are the helpless and hopeless. The 
scheme of Gen. Booth is primarily for these classes, and “consists in the 
formation of these people into self-helping and self-sustaining commu- 
nities, each being a kind of codperative society or patriarchal family, 
governed and disciplined on the principles which have already proved 
so effective in the Salvation Army. These communities are divided 
into (1) the city colony, (2) the farm colony, and (3) the over-sea col- 
ony. 
The city colony consists of harbors of refuge for the destitute, sup- 
plying their immediate necessities, furnishing temporary employment, 
giving hope for the future, and commencing a course of regeneration by 
moral and religious influences. Those who are found sincere, industri- 
ous, and honest are advanced to the farm colony, which consists of a 
settlement of the colonists on an estate in the provinces, in the culture 
of which they would find employment and obtain support. Here the 
process of reformation is to be carried on by the same industrial, moral, 
and religious methods as have been commenced in the city. Especial 
attention is given to those forms of labor and that knowledge of ag- 
riculture which would qualify the colonist for labor in some other land, 
should he fail to find employment in his own country. Codperative 
farms might be provided; but the great majority, after trial and train- - 
ing, would be passed to the foreign settlement, which constitutes the 
oyer-sea colony. 
It is generally agreed that j inthe English colonies in South Africa, 
Canada, and western Australia there are millions of acres of useful and 
cheap land. The plan of the over-sea colony is to secure a tract of 
land, prepare it for settlement, establish in it authority, govern it by 
laws, assist it in necessity, gradually develop it with a prepared peo- 
ple, and so create a home for the destitute. 
“The lost, the outcast, and the disinherited in the world” are those 
for whom Gen. Booth’s scheme is intended. This ‘submerged tenth” 
number about 3,000,000 souls in England. The church does not seem- 
to have been able to reach the depths of vice and destitution; there is 
want of enthusiasm, and vesthetical considerations are no slight hin- 
drance. Benevolent societies have accomplished much, but they are 
necessarily limited and do not seem to be adequate to cope with the 
deepest evils. In spite of all criticism, the Salvation Army scheme 
 
-P-A-G-E-617
  SOCIAL ‘PATHOLOGY AND) EDUCATION. 589. 
supplies a felt and positive need in the social organisin, which is shown 
_-by its growth. A few years ago it did not exist; it now has more than 
9,000 officers and 3,000 centers in different parts of the world. The 
attention that-it attracts in all classes is noteworthy. The controlling 
motive is avowedly religious. The words of the founder are: “I may 
at once say, that without the new hope, the new incentives to honest 
labor, and the new sense of brotherhood which come mainly if not solely 
to these classes by religious means, I should regard my whole scheme 
as little better than a dream.” The one test of admission is willing- 
ness to work, the one condition of remaining is obedience to orders; 
“every individual is perfectly free to follow any religious convictions 
or opinions he or she may possess;” no one is compelled to attend Sal- 
vationist services; ‘a man may rise from the lowest social strata 
through every stage of its scheme to its highest point, and yet remain an 
atheist to the last.” 
That the scheme is respected by persons of all shades of opinion is 
illustrated by the fact that the Marquis of Queensberry, in forwarding 
a check of £100 to Gen. Booth, stated that he sent “this mite as a 
reverent agnostic to the common cause of humanity.” Such, in brief, 
is a general idea of the scheme. ; 
RESULTS OF THE SCHEME. 
General Booth, on condition of the public furnishing him £1,000,000, 
or £100,000 in cash and £30,000 yearly, being the interest on £1,000,000 
at 3 per cent, bound himself and the salvation army to abolish poverty 
in London. He soon received the £100,000 required. The accotint of 
the first year’s work of the scheme, issued by the salvation army, shows 
for London the following: For men—eight shelters, 7 food depots, 
3 poor man’s metropoles (superior lodging houses), 1 labor bureau, 6 
workshops and labor factories. For women—eight rescue homes, 1 
help and inquiry department, 8 registry, 1 shelter and food depot, 1 
lodging house, 1 bookbinding factory, 1 knitting factory, 1 laundry, 
and 21 slum officers’ posts. 
In the year 1889~90 the trading operations of the army were carried 
“on with the net profit for the year of £12,800, of which £10, po was 
paid over to general funds of the army. 
All sorts of the most suffering and degraded took advantage of the 
food depots; the farthing meals were especially beneficial to the chil- 
dren. There is no charity. The rescue homes record 1,300 girls, 
The consolidation of the work has been given special attention dur- 
ing the year. Captain Nicol says that they are not believers in merely 
spasmodic effort, although they welcome ‘outbursts in soul-saving™ 
or anything else that tends to deliverance of mankind from misery 
and. sin.”

The farm colony consists of three farms, making 1,150 acres of land, 
within 37 miles of London by road and 41 by the Thames, on which it 
partly borders. Buildings have been erected, and a large number of 
able-bodied poor have begun work. 4 
While it will be some time before an impartial judgment as to the 
value and practibility of the scheme can be made, yet it may be said 
that the results thus far are not disappointing.

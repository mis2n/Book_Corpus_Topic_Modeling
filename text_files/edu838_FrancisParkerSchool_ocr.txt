PREFACE 
  
There has been a break of two years in the publication of the 
Francis W. Parker Scuoot Yxar Booxs. This was due to the fact 
that the faculty deemed a new and radically improved course’ of study 
necessary, and voted,.in the fall of 1915, to devote the faculty study 
and meeting time as far as possible to the preparation of a representa- 
tive school curriculum, with a view to publishing it as the fifth Year 
Boor. : 
The entire faculty was divided, according to their own choice, 
into the following committees: Committee on English, Committee on 
Foreign Languages, Committee on Science, Committce on History, 
Committee on Handwork, Committee on Art, and the Problems Com- 
mittee. This latter committee set out to find real problems, arising 
naturally in the lives of the children, and to make these problems the 
basis of the course of study. It reported to the faculty in a series of 
meetings, and at the end of the year presented plans for reorganizing 
the work of the school. 
While these plans provided opportunity for the exercise of a large 
measure of initiative and choice on the part of the pupil and the devel- 
opment of a scheme of self-government in the high school; they did not 
seem immediately practical in their entirety. The faculty discussions 
were stimulating and instructive, and influenced strongly current class- 
room teaching and the work of the other committees, but it was found 
_ at the end of the year that there was nothing ready for publication. 
Of the other reports, that of the science committee was nearest 
to completion; and its members were asked, if possible, to get the 
science curriculum of the school in shape for publication in June, 
1917. Other matters of pressing importance for faculty consideration 
again delayed the work, so that the fifth Year Boox is not being 
issued until July of the current year. It is hoped that this volume 
will prove useful to teachers of science in many schools, not as a 
finished, static product, but as describing the way in which one im- 
portant type of human experience and study is dealt with in one school. 
It is proposed that in the sixth Year Boox an attempt be made 
to show how the World War for Freedom has influenced the class-room 
work and activities in our school. The title of this book will probably 
be Education During War Time.

GENERAL PRINCIPLES UNDERLYING THE ORGANI- 
ZATION OF THE COURSE IN SCIENCE 
  
The chief value of any course of study is that it. provides a good 
point of departure for new attempts to improve the choice of materials 
and the methods of instruction. It embodies the best that has been 
accomplished, clarifies the situation, and makes possible further 
progress. Any tendency to crystallize the methods of working, or to 
fix the content of subject matter, is to be avoided. Therefore, the 
course in sciénce which is presented in this year book is looked upon, 
not as a finished piece of work but as a stepping-stone to better science 
teaching. It is not a curriculum which has been written by a few in 
authority with the expectation that teachers will slavishly follow it, 
but it is the result of a number of years of independent, experimental, 
and developmental work in all the grades of the school. For this very 
reason it may be criticized as somewhat incoherent and lacking in 
logical development from grade to grade, faults which made-to-order 
curricula usually lack. This criticism is not dismissed as unimportant, 
for it indicates the direction in which future improvement may be 
sought and secured all the more easily, by reason of the work which 
the preparation of this course of study has involved. 
The first step in formulating the course in science was to draw 
up a statement of the general principles which were to control the 
work. This formulation of principles, after discussion and revision 
was accepted by all members of the science committee as a tentative 
basis on which to proceed. When the work was nearly complete, the 
statement of fundamental ‘principles was again critically examined 
and further revised in the light of what had been accomplished. The 
final revision, which follows, has been presented to the faculty as a 
whole and approved by them. 
I. 
The science course shall be organized about those problems and 
activities of the-child which call for study, investigation, and ex- 
periment in the fields of physical and natural science. 
(a) The problem basis for organization of the science course 
does not mean that the logical or formal organization, so prominent 
5
-P-A-G-E-7
6 Francis W. Parker ScLeooL 
in most curricula will be lost to sight, but that the logical organization 
will be subordinated to the natural or psychological. organization, 
based on activities and needs. It is reasonable to suppose that if the 
problems are adequate in number and scope, and properly worked out, 
the need for formal and logical organization will be felt and developed * 
naturally in the course of the work, rather than made the artificial 
starting-point for it. 
() The problems of the course, as worked out, should make the 
pupil conscious of fundamental scientific principles, thus preventing 
scrappiness and making for the proper organization of the science 
work. 
(c) While the problem basis for the course insures a content 
with a direct appeal to the pupil, it docs not follow that the full or 
larger values of the work will be apparent at the outset. The work 
as it develops should produce a growing appreciation of its larger 
value. 
(d) The problems chosen should provide fer a certain amount 
of overlapping, so that information gained in connection with one 
‘problem will be used in the solution of others, and the experience 
gained in one grade utilized in the work of the next. 
(e) The course, in addition to formulating these problems, 
should supply needful data, lists of material, sources of information, 
and directions for their solution. 
. 
The science course shall provide abundant opportunity for the 
pupil to acquire a rich and varied experience through actual contact 
with real materials. Informational topics and discussion shall give 
place, whenever possible, to experiments, to the handling of materials, 
to the working with apparatus, to the acquiring of first-hand ex- 
perience on which inferences and conclusions may properly be based. 
(a) Discussion without a proper basis of experience, and in- 
ferences based.on guess work, lead to a destruction of real interest ‘ 
and tend to establish habits of thought which are intellectually and 
morally dangerous. 
(6) Programs must be sufficiently flexible to make possible the 
widest use of the shops, the laboratories, the garden, and of excur- 
sions for experimental and observational work.
-P-A-G-E-8
Year Book o Y 
(c) The care of pets and animals in the graderoom, or on the 
school grounds provides projects of especial value. This work develops 
individual and social responsibility and secures a wholesome contact 
with animal life which would otherwise be absent from the experience 
of many children. 
(d) ach grade will require special science apparatus, aquaria, 
work-benches, sand- and delta-tables, and materials of great variety. 
Space to store and to use freely this equipment is indispensable. 
II. 
The teacher’s freedom, individuality, and preferences, shall be 
“given wide range in the matter of developing the problems suggested 
in tlie science course, and in finding new and better ones. 
(a) The science curriculum should be flexible and dynamic, con- 
stantly developing and improving, not fixed and static. Towards this 
end the teachers actually engaged in carrying on the work. are best 
able to detect weaknesses and suggest improvements. These teachers 
therefore must take an important part in the preparation and framing 
of any syllabus or course of study in science. 
(b) It does not follow that teachers should be free to follow mere 
personal opinion or that they should indulge every whim in modifying 
the course of study. They shoild expect to justify every innovation 
by sound’ reasons and prove by the results obtained the worth of their 
ideas, 
Tv. 
Specialized science has little or no place in the curriculum of the 
elementary school. 
(a) Elementary biology, botany, physics, chemistry, etc., should 
not be taught as such, but much material drawn from these several 
sciences will contribute.to the satisfaction of thé child’s interests and 
the solution of his problems. The necessary elements from these 
special sciences will thus be fused by these interests and problems 
into an organic whole, and not remain a composite of fragments taken 
from the divisions of specialized science. : 
(b) The problem if properly chosen, developed, and carried out, 
will enable the child to gain a fund of experience and knowledge which 
can. be stated in terms of specialized science, and so the adequacy and 
‘completeness of the course can be ‘estimated.
-P-A-G-E-9
8 Francis W. Parker ScHooL 
(c) The problem basis of organization will by its very nature , 
prevent specialization. Few problems will be found which lie wholly 
inside the limits of a single specialized science. 
Vv. 
"The natural interests of children in the elementary school call 
for the study of plant life, animal life, climate, foods and food supply, 
rocks and the soil, earth forms, and of simple machines and mechanical 
forces. Many of the problems involved are geographical, or have 
geographical causal relations. The work will gain in continuity, 
effectiveness, and coherence, if these relations are emphasized. 
(a) The organization of a comprehensive course in science, on 
the basis: of large projects with subordinate problems, experiments, 
and the like, requires the inclusion of geography as an integral part 
of the course of study, and makes possible problems of a more varied 
character and of wider scope. It also makes for a simpler and more 
flexible school program. 
VI. 
The science course shall be continuous throughout the eight 
years of the elementary school, and furnish a proper basis and back- 
ground of experience for the high-school courses in specialized science. 
(a) The problems of the pupil constantly require the study of 
science and the development of scientific methods of study in order 
to find their solution. For this reason, science study rightly belongs 
in every year of both the elementary and the high-school life of the 
child.* 
Vil. 
The many connections and correlations which science work has 
with other subjects of study shall be indicated as fully as possible in 
presenting the course in Science. 
(a) Science work demands accuracy of definition, the power to 
organize material, the ability to think logically and to express the 
thought in clear and concise statements. This training in habits of 
thought which underlies clear and exact. expression should render 
more effective all the written and oral composition of the school, and 
is one of the most important services which science study makes to 
the education of the child. 
  
"To give such a course is at present not possible in our high school, on account of | the lack of facilities, as explained in the article on Science in the High School.
-P-A-G-E-10
Year Boox , 9 
(b) The work’ in science frequently requires the use of mathe- 
matics and so supplies real problems for its study. 
(c) Much of the handwork in many grades grows directly out 
of the science problems and contributes vitally to their solution. 
Viti. 
In the elementary school hygiene and physiology shall be taught 
in connection with the gymnasium work and preferably by the gym- 
nasium teacher. These subjects naturally contribute to each other— 
the work in the gymnasium offering opportunity to apply what has 
been learned in recitations in hygiene and physiology, and the latter 
serving to make the former more purposeful and intelligent. 
(a) It is thought that these teachers will be able to connect 
matters of hygiene and physiology with the problems of exercise, 
muscular control, proper methods of eating, breathing, etc., so as to 
furnish real motive for this study. 
(b) The segregated classes will admit of freer and more normal 
discussion of certain important problems connected with hygiene. 
In the detailed outlines of the science course which follow, it is 
hoped that the reader will find the embodiment of the principles which 
- have been set forth. While the problem basis of organization is shown 
throughout the work, it has seemed necessary to retain many topical 
headings and divisions, in order to show how.the problems and ques- 
tions of the pupil naturally classify into topics or units of study. This 
also tends to offset the objection most commonly made to problem 
or project teaching, that it fails to secure a proper grounding in the 
fundamental principles of science and results in a hodge-podge of 
unrelated facts and ideas. 
In harmony with the second fundamental principle, the emphasis , 
throughout has been placed on the experimental work as the chief 
means of securing that first-hand experience and the actual handling 
of materials which is the special contribution of science study to the 
education of the child. For this reason, such purely descriptive work 
as the picturesque side of geography, the study of peoples and customs, 
has been largely eliminated from the outline. 
The outcome of the science work in the several grades as well as 
its relation to the work in mathematics, English, and handwork. is 
indicated by the illustrations, by representative children’s papers, . 
recitations and morning exercises.

NATURE STUDY IN THE KINDERGARTEN 
  
Natute experiences in the kindergarten are the outgrowth of 
contact with materials brought into the room by teachers or pupils, 
or from the observations made during frequent walks in the park 
and trips to the country. In the park, easily accessible are a 00, 
large bird-house, conservatory, fountain, garden, the Academy of 
Sciences, and the lake shore within a distance of four blocks. The 
children are frequently in the country for week-ends, besides spending 
the summer months on farms, at the seashore, or in the mountains. 
The rich background thus furnished, with the immediate kinder- 
garten environment, affords splendid opportunities for developing 
definite nature imagery. The collecting instinct is much weaker in. 
children of kindergarten age than the instinct to play, but they do 
like to pick up things and take them to some interested person, teacher 
or parent. Naturally, they do not know what to do with their col- 
lections, and this is where the teacher should take hold of the budding 
instinct and strengthen it in every legitimate way. We make use of 
every appropriate means of expression to help the children build up 
well-defined images of the essential elements of their observations. 
THe older children can express more than the younger ones, but a 
given experience is common to all through conversation, songs, stories, 
pictures, specimens, and games. The principal nature centers we fol- 
low for a little way are given herewith, together with the activities 
associated with them. 
Leaves.—The first center growing out of our walks is that of the 
falling leaves. We obtain brightly colored leaves with which to work, 
and make the impression through the activities of drawing, cutting, 
painting, and clay impressions. Appropriate songs are used, and the 
poem, How the Leaves Come Down. . 
Rain. —Rain is talked about on some of the first rainy days. We 
ask such questions as: Where does it come from? What does it do 
for us? Who likes it? Rhymes and poéms about the rain are said, 
songs about the rain are sung, and the story of How we First Came 
to'Have Umbrellas is told. The story is illustrated with clay or by 
drawings. Pictures of a rainy day are drawn on the blackboard or 
on paper. : : .

Bulbs.—Bulbs for indoor blooming are planted in October. It is 
usually the first contact with bulbs that the children have ever had. 
The work consists of sifting the earth, mixing in fertilizer, and prop- 
erly planting paper-white narcissus and daffodil bulbs. Drawings and 
models of the bulbs are made. Drawings are made of the narcissus: 
and daffodils when in bloom, and plaques of the daffodils are modeled 
for paper-weights. 
FI 
    PREPARING THE WINDOW BOXES FOR BULBS 
The Fall Harvest.—The harvest idea is built upon the children’s 
summer experiences upon the farms, which we vivify by pictures and 
concrete materials. We emphasize what we get from gardens, orchards, 
and fields. We talk about places of storing, using the barn as the 
chief center, and how supplies reach our homes through the grocery, 
by trains, and by boats. We model the better known vegetables and 
fruits; build barns and bins in which to store the modeled fruits and 
vegetables ; lay out a farm in a sand-tray, and make individual farms 
on smaller trays. Jelly is made as e sample of thr way fruit. is storet

in our city homes. Stories embodying the ingathering idea are told 
and illustrated, and harvest songs are sung. 
Seeds.—The seed we usually emphasize is the milkweed, the pods 
of which we model, and later we let the seeds fly outdoors. Beyond 
this simple experience, seeds make almost no appeal to children of 
kindergarten age. 
WINTER QUARTER 
Winter Sports—With the first good snow in January, we begin 
active winter sports, such as tobogganing, sliding on sleds and ice, 
making snow men, and shoveling snow. We look for tracks in the ~ 
  PUTTING ON THE FINISHING TOUCHES 
snow and observe frost pictures and snow crystals. We build to- 
boggans with large blocks, make wooden sleds large enough to use, 
and make snow men out doors. Pictures are used to show many kinds 
of winter sports other than children can play, the aim being to em-

Yrar Book 13 
phasize the fun winter affords. We have good songs about snowflakes 
and snow men, and poems and stories that tell about winter time. 
  A GAME OF FOX AND GEESE 
Animal Life—Winter walks take us often to the animal- and 
bird-house. As a center of interest for several weeks, the animals wwe 
like best are’ used. These ‘are the elephant, bear, lion, tiger, giraffe, 
and: camel. The making of a zoo is the unifying purpose, and under 
its stimulus the animals are modeled, cut free hand, drawn on n, the

board, and painted. Cages are made from pasteboard boxes. Good 
pictures of the animals are cut out, mounted on cardboard, and then

14 Francis W. Parker Scuoon 
on small blocks, so they can be used to play with, as the clay models 
are too fragile for this purpose. Good mounted pictures of the animals 
are about the room; Songs about bears, clephants and tigers are sung, 
and animal stories and anecdotes are told. The children choose any 
animal they like, and as many as they like, which stimulates ob- 
servation. . . . 
“Suri.—Some time in March, when the power of the sun begins to 
be strongly felt, we follow up the question, What does the sun do for 
us? ielts,the snow, swells the buds oxi trees and bushes, starts the 
grass and pussy-willows. The children illustrate the story of The Wind 
and the Sun; sing songs of the sun, daffodils, and pussy-willows; 
model and draw the pussy-willows, and make pictures of the indoor 
flowers. . 
    SPRING QUARTER 
. The activities of the spring quarter are centered mainly about 
what is happening out of doors. 
Wind.—In early April the problem is to find out what the wind 
does for us. It helps in sailing boats, flying kites, drying clothes, and

turning mills. The weather-vane shows the direction of the wind, and 
helps certain people to know when to do their work. ‘The activities 
include making pinwheels of paper to play with out doors; making 
sailboats of wood to be sailed on the lagoon or fountain basin ; cutting

clothes of paper to hang on clothes-lines; washing paint cloths or 
doll-clothes and drying in the wind ; folding small sailboats of. paper; 
cutting, folding or drawing balloons and kites, and making weather- 
vanes of wood or heavy cardboard. The stories of The Foolish Weather- 
    
    BIRD-BOXES AND GARDEN TOOLS 
Vane and Little Half. Chick are illustrated by drawings or models. 
We use songs about the wind, arid Stevenson’s poem, The Wind. 
     
MAKING NESTS FOR THE PARK BIRDS 
+ Birds —We aim to become acquainted with some of the birds we 
see daily, particularly the robin, bronzed grackle, sap-sucker, red-
-P-A-G-E-17
16 Franois W. Parker ScHoon 
headed woodpecker and yellow warbler. We see many more birds than 
these, and the children most interested learn to know some of them. 
We look for food, nesting-places, nests, and eggs. We listen for bird 
songs and calls; make use of stuffed specimens of birds in our room, 
and visit the Academy of Sciences. We use the stories How the Robin's 
Breast Became Red, and The Origin of the Red-Headed Woodpecker. 
As our experience enlarges we talk about the good birds do, the 
‘pleasure they give; and what we may do to attract them to our homes. 
‘The children draw, model, and paint nests, eggs, and birds; make 
bird-boxes of wood to take home; illustrate stories, and sing songs 
about birds. 
    BUILDING THE GARDEN FENCE 
Flowers.—During the winter when the bulbs in the window-boxes 
_ are in blossom, we make pictures or models of them, and thus become 
acquainted with the paper-white narcissus, daffodil, and crocus. 
Later, we emphasize the tulip and dandelion, and any other flowers 
we may have a particular reason for wanting to know., These flowers 
are modeled, painted, and drawn. We.use them for designs, or decora- 
tions for book covers or May baskets. We emphasize the colors and 
odors of flowers, first by actual experience and then by sense games. 
Sometimes we are able to trace the pollen the bees bring to the hive, 
’ particularly that of the oriental poppy and the dandelion. Suitable 
songs and stories help to strengthen these images.
-P-A-G-E-18
Year Boor : 17 
  COMPLETED FENCE AND BED OF PORTULACCA 
Garden.—Gardening isn’t a natural interest of little children, but 
digging is. We have gradually reduced the amount of real gardening 
to planting a bed of popcorn by the older group of children. This 
furnishes a crop to harvest in the autumn when théy have entered 
first grade, besides being a good seed to handle in planting. The 
younger children have planted climbing beans, morning-glories, sun- 
flowers, and portulacca about the lunch-room and printing-shop. The 
responsibility resulting from such planting is small; yet enough to 
initiate them into garden processes. The work includes making garden- 
stakes and labels, and, at one time, a garden-fence; laying out 
plan of corn-bed in sand-tray; drawing plan of same; staking and 
marking hills in the garden; spading and raking in. preparation 
for planting; and weeding. We use songs, games, and finger plays to 
help build up the processes of simple gardening. 
Buds and Leaves—In the spring we watch their development 
through twigs brought indoors and the bushes and trees outdoors. 
We use the pussy-willow and twigs from the cottonwood, lilac, and 
oak. We draw and model the pussy-willow. 
Butterflies, Moths, Dragonflies——In the autumn we generally find 
the common woolly caterpillars and put them in a cage to watch for 
the winter house they make. Usually someone brings in the cocoons 
of the cecropia moth, We have had the chrysalises of the monarch
-P-A-G-E-19

    ‘ANING THE YARD WITH THEIR OWN RAKES 
: and black-swallowtail butterflies and had both come out in the kinder- 
garten. Children are unfailingly interested in this development of 
moths and butterflies, and to stimulate their observation, we make 
pictures of them by drawing or cutting, and model the cocoons. They 
gather, by conversation and observation, that butterflies obtain their 
food from flowers. We generally see many dragonflies in the spring, 
but do no more with them than call them by name, contrast them 
with butterflies, and refute the tradition that they sew up children’s 
. ears, , 
Earthworms and Ants——-We sometimes prepare a large glass 
jar with varying layers of soil, have the children put in earthworms, 
cover the jar to keep it dark, and watch the results. We have never 
had an ant-colony, but do notice both earthworm castings and ant- 
hills on our walks. The children are much interested in the way 
robins extract earthworms for their food. 
Bees.—There is a hive of bees in the kindergarten room from 
early spring to November. These are placed in a south window, the 
lower sash of which is raised about four inches; an extra piece of 
wood is fitted under it, with.an opening about a foot long and two 
inches high. From the hive to this opening, a runway is made of 
glass, which fits closely the exit leading outdoors. This furnishes 
opportunity to watch the bees as they go, and come on their busy 
rounds. Under these conditions, bees afford the most normal indoor
-P-A-G-E-20
Yurar Book 19 
insect life we have observed. Most of the activities of the bees are too 
difficult for ‘the children to follow, but they are greatly interested in 
watching the bees move about in the hive and fly to and from it. 
Whenever we find bees on flowers in the park, we claim them for ours. 
We do see them bring in the pollen, sometimes note the color of it, 
and trace its possible source. When the young bees are hatching, we 
place the trays containing them next to the outside of the hive, so the 
children can see some of these activities. The knowledge gained con- 
sists chiefly of the facts that bees make honey from flowers, live in 
hives, and are interesting creatures, 
OUTCOME ~ 
Aside from the physical activities just stated, there are other 
gains from these simple beginnings of life-long interests. Gradually 
the children are increasing their power to attend; their observations 
are being defined; their sympathy and respect for plant and animal 
life is enlarged; and they have real joy in gathering the leaves, in 
finding the first opening buds, and in watching the robins build their 
nests. Nature interests are an important factor in leading the child 
away from himself out into the great life around him. Certainly, 
no subject in the kindergarten has greater possibilities for awakening 
wonder and laying the foundation for the seeing eye and the hearing 
ear. 
CHANGE IN PROGRAM 
A radical change has been made in the matter of group work in 
the kindergarten for the year 1917-18. Heretofore the program began 
with a period about thirty minutes in length, which was devoted to 
general exercises with the whole group of kindergarten children seated 
about the director. At such times there was singing, exhibits of toys, 
and other concrete materials; contributions by the children of their 
experiences outside of school; a talk about some phase of the subject 
forming the basis of the program, or a story. Following this, there 
was a period of twenty minutes for rhythmic exercises and games. 
Then the children were divided into groups, according to age and 
ability, and were cared for by different teachers. These teachers 
planned what should be done at the table, and chose the material with 
which to work. There were two of these group periods; the second 
one, being out of doors, afforded the opportunity for many excursions 
to the park. The handwork previously given as the result of this
-P-A-G-E-21
20 Francis W, Parker ScHoon 
nature contact was worked out under the direction of -the group 
teacher. There was opportunity for creative work by the children 
and real expression was afforded by this plan of work, but the teacher 
chose the general subject and the materials. 
This year, we have adopted a plan of allowing the children to 
choose what they shall do, and the materials with which to do it, for 
a period varying from forty to sixty minutes each morning. Usually 
we have a general exercise, as formerly, when we come together for 
an interchange of ideas and experiences; but when the children go to 
their projects as soon as they arrive in the morning and are too in- 
terested to care to leave them, the general exercise may be delayed or 
omitted for the day. With such a plan of work, more material is about 
and more time than formerly is needed to put it away; for it is one 
of the rules that the children must assist in getting the room in order. 
With the plan of allowing the children to choose what they shall 
do for the given period, it follows that the teachers are not making the 
demand that they express in some form their nature observations. 
The result is, we have much less of that type of expression than 
formerly. But what has happened has been very interesting. From 
the beginning, children have been bringing in nature materials even 
more than usual. We have talked about them and cared for them. 
We have needed the insect cage for the caterpillars and cocoons; we 
have pressed leaves, strung seeds, and have done some drawing on 
the blackboard. All of the marked seasonal changes have been as 
interesting as in other years. Because of the great amount of snow 
and severe weather, we have had occasion to accentuate more strongly 
the poems, stories, and songs about winter. Although there was a 
sample sled in the room, only one child wanted to make one, and that 
was not a success. 
Heretofore, we have emphasized the bird-box when the birds re- 
turned in April. This year, early in January, a boy came in one 
morning and said he wanted to make a bird-box to take to his ranch 
in Montana. There are two sample bird-boxes in the room. The 
teacher, to whom the boy made known his wants, said she thought he 
would be unable to make a box such as these alone, and suggested a 
robin’s shelter instead. The boy was satisfied with this substitute, 
and proceeded with his project. From time to time other boys have 
made these bird-shelters entirely on their own initiative. ‘Recently 
a little boy, who had done very crude handwork, announced that he
-P-A-G-E-22
Year Boox 21 
wanted to make a bird-box. Upon investigation it proved he didn’t 
want to make the bird-shelter, but a bluebird-house. To convince the 
teacher as to just what he wanted, he got the sample box and showed 
her. After some talk on the ways and means of making it, it was 
settled that he should have the wood to work with; and the result has 
been a remarkable gain in power in handwork and appreciation for 
a piece of work well done. 
The first signs of spring, the swelling leaf-buds and the “blossom- 
ing grass,” as one four-year-old called the first showing of green grass, 
are really exciting. 
The new regime has not been carried through an entire school 
year; but such experiences as these lead us to expect as much real 
appreciation and joy through nature contacts this year as by the 
method formerly used.

THE FIRST GRADE 
In the first grade, the great problem in nature study is to help 
the child understand his environment in its relation to himself; to 
help him interpret the phenomena with which he comes in daily 
contact; and through observation and simple experiments to enable 
him to know more of the collections he may make. These prob- 
lems are related to the fundamental needs of food, shelter and 
clothing. 
‘ ‘The child has the following centers of interest near at hand: 
The garden; the farm; the park, with its trees and flowers, including 
two type forms of landscape; the woods; and the lake shore. The 
garden study answers such questions as: How are seeds planted? 
What do they need to make them grow? How do weeds and cultivated 
plants differ in growth? 
The problems which are considered in the study of the farm 
are related to its various activities, the work to be done, its plant and 
animal life. Such questions as these are discussed: Where does our 
bread come from? Where do we get our milk? Where do our fruit 
and vegetables come from? - 
The lake shore is visited for the purpose of asking such questions 
as the following: What does water do to stones? What colors are 
found in stones? Where does the water come from that we drink? 
A visit to the woods is made for the purpose of collecting leaves. 
and seeds, and to become acquainted with many trees. This visit is 
also to make it possible to realize that a shelter may be made from 
brush. The park is also visited in order to study special trees, as the 
oak, elm, cottonwood, basswood, and pine, and to recognize ‘familiar 
flowers. 
Throughout the work, water-colors, drawings, and models in clay 
are used to interpret the types of landscape observed, and as a means 
of expression of the child’s observations. 
FALL 
The Garden.—The child’s first interest in the fall is to find out 
what has happened to the popcorn which he planted in the spring

while in §he,kindergarten. Harvesting the corn and husking it raises 
the probleni of seed distribution. How did trees get planted? What 
helps the planting of weeds? 
“Zhe relation of structure to distribution is brought itt through 
the examination of the seeds of various trees and weeds. The pupils . 
observe that maple seeds have wings; that the linden: seed isan air- 
ship; that the seed of the bladder-bush is like a ‘balloon; that the . 
and burdock have hooks; while the Spanish needle has 
spines;.4imd that’ the seeds of the thistle, dandelion, milkweed, and 
goldénrod,are like parachutes. They conclude that seeds are.scattered 
by the wind, water, animals, and people. The question is raised.as to 
what seeds people plant, and why? “ 
Foods.—The general question here’is, where does our food come 
from? Lasts of foods ‘are made to answer this question, and an ex- 
eursion is made to a model farm. 
(a) Farm Animals.-The children observe the horses, cows, pigs, sheep, 
calves, colts; the ducks, geese, turkeys, and hens. They learn how the ani- 
mals are cared for, and what food they need. They feed the hens and pigs. 
(b) Storehouses.—Barns, corn cribs, silos, hay and straw stacks, bins, 
with their stores of wheat, oats, and corn are noted. 
(c) Farm Machinery—The mower, hay-rake, hay-stacker, reaper, plow, 
and corn-cutter are observed and distinguished.   
-P-A-G-E-25

Preparation For Winter-—The preparation for winter is the final 
fall topic. The questions considered here are: How do people prepare 
for winter—clothing, food, fuel? How do animals prepare for winter— 
thicker fur and hair? How. do trees and plants prepare for the winter? 
Where do worms, toads and insects live? What do the bitds do? 
In this connection, we study the poem, The Swallow. 
WINTER 
At this time of the year, light, heat, and cold are influences which 
are strongly felt, and are the first impressions leading toward a study 
of the seasons and their causes. Seasonal differences are expressed 
through water-color drawings. : 
Light.—The shortened day brings up the need of artificial light. 
The children list and draw everything that gives light. They make 
candlée-holders out of clay and bayberry candles for Christmas.’ 
Eskimo Life—The short dark days, deep snow, and cutting winds, 
are conditions which enable the child to obtain a sympathetic under-

standing of the climate of the Eskimo. An imaginary visit is made to 
Greenland. The play instinct and the imagination are utilized in 
making this journey, and New York is reached by traveling on a 
train made of benches and a table. A boat is obtained through the
-P-A-G-E-26

same medium and provided with food and clothing suitable for the 
trip. Lists of canned.and dried meats and fruits are written upon, the 
board, and other necessary foods which will not spoil. 7 
: .A realistic picture of the arctie region is supplied by means of 
many pictures and stereopticon slides, and through the actual ob- 
sérvation -of the frozen lake, as seen by the children in passing to 
and from school. A visit is made to Lincoln Park, to see the’ polar 
bears, wolves, arctic fox, and Eskimo dogs. We also go to the -Field 
Museum to see the mounted animals from the north, the musk ox, 
seal, walrus, and whale. The exhibits show some of the Eskimo oc- 
cupations. The sledges, made of small pieces of wood and bone, 
suggest not only the materials used, but the climate as well. The 
kayaks, made of skin, show how the Eskimo uses what is nearest at 
hand in order to meet his needs. The carvings and drawings on ivory 
suggest to the child something: of the Eskimo’s artistic tendencies, as 
well as his patience and skill. 
These trips help the child to answer his own questions: What 
does the Eskimo wear? How does he catch animals? How does he 
travel from place to place? How does he warm his house? Of what 
does he make a fire? What kind of a stove does he use? 
An Eskimo village, including the animals on the land and in 
the sea, is modeled in clay. Pictures are drawn and painted, and 
stories are written describing the pictures. In the play period, an 
Eskimo igloo is made of ‘snow. The school leaflets, on Eskimo life, 
are read.    
  Heat—(a) Thermometers-—-The large thermometer from The Daily 
News is used and compared with an ordinary thermometer. The parts of the 
thermometer are noted—the wooden back, the numbers, the glass tube, with 
its mercury or fluid contents. The reading af the numbers on each side 
of the glass tube gives practice in counting by twos. 
Experiment—The children place the thermometer in cold water, and 
then in hot, watching the effect on the mercury. 
(b) Tue Errect or Corp anp Heat Upon Arr. 
Experiment—With the aid of the thermometer, we find the differences 
in temperature of the air on the floor, near the ceiling, and out of doors. 
The chifdern are asked to observe the furnace, or heating-plant at home, 
and all observe the furnace at school. This enables them to answer ques- 
tions as to how homes are heated and how the schoolrooms are kept warm. 
(c) Tre Errect or Heat anp Corp Upon Water. 
Experiment—The children boil water in glass beakers, and observe
-P-A-G-E-27

  INVESTIGATING THE EFFECTS OF HEAT ON WATER 
the bubbles. Where do they go? What becomes of the “water dust” or 
steam? 
Experiment (performed by the teacher),—A bottle or flask is filled half 
full of water, fitted tightly with a stopper and placed over the alcohol lamp. 
until steam forms in sufficient quantity to force out the cork, Why did the 
cork fly out? What work does steam do for us? 
This leads us to’a simple study of condensation and evaporation. Under 
condensation the questions are: What is rain? How does the water get 
into the air? What makes the mist you see over lake, pond, or river? 
Experiment—A cold glass is held over boiling water and the condensa- 
tion noted. Basins of different shapes, but containing the same amount of 
water, are placed in the room. The children observe from which basin the 
water disappears the quickest. As a result of this work they see that the 
basin with the largest surface exposed to the air dries up first. Application 
is made to the drying of clothes on wash-days. 
Experiment.—The children place the thermometer in snow and note the 
freezing-point. What is snow? What is hail? A bottle is filled full of 
water and placed outside to freeze. Why. did the bottle break? Why was 
the cork pushed out? . 
Experiment—Snow and salt are stirred together in glass tumblers until © 
frost appears on the outside of the tumblers. 
(d) Ervect or Heat upon Sotips—The class observes that ice melts, 
wood burns, and metals become heated. 
Experiment.—Steel and copper rods are- placed in the flame, to find 
which is the best conductor of heat. The ball and ring apparatus is
-P-A-G-E-28
YzEAR Boox 27 
obtained from the physics department, and after being used by the teacher 
each child has an opportunity to experiment with it for himself. 
Cooking.—Apples and potatoes are’ cooked out of doors, in a 
brick oven made by the children. The effect. of heat upon cereals is 
brought out when cornmeal, cream of wheat, oatmeal, and barley.are 
cooked for luncheon. The effect of heat upon sugar is noted in the 
making of candy for Christmas. Maple sugar is made in March and 
the rising boiling-point observed on . the thermometer during the 
evaporation. 
Cakes, sandwiches, cocoa, and lemonade are made with the social 
motive of preparing these things for a luncheon, a grade party, or 
a mothers’ meeting. Butter, cottage cheese, and ice cream are also 
made in the same way. The children learn how to set the table and 
serve the articles of food which they have prepared. They wash the 
dishes, put them away, and set the room in order. 
Crystals—Frost crystals, snow crystals, and crystals in ice are 
observed, compared, and drawings of them are made. Mineral crystals 
of quartz, calcite, and galena are in the room, and their orystal 
form is observed in this connection. 
Experiment—Making crystals. Crystals of salt, sugar, alum, copper © 
sulphate, potassium bichromate and potassium: chromate are made in the 
following manner: A cup of cold water is placed in a glass beaker and 
alum added, as: much as will dissolve. The water is then. heated with the 
alcohol lamp, and it is found’that more alum will dissolve in. the hot.water. 
Alum is now added in. small quantities until a precipitate forms on ‘the 
stirring-rod. Strings or twigs are then placed in the solution, on which 
crystals are deposited as the solution cools. Crystals of the other materials 
may be prepared in the same way. The apparatus used for this experiment 
consists: of ring-stand,. alcohol lamp, wire gauze and glass beaker. © ~ 
The following reading lesson grew out of the work with crystals:

We found crystals tinder the ice. 
We found crystals in the stones. 
The kindergarten had a Christmas tree. 
We thought crystals would look pretty on the tree. 
We made many kinds of crystals. 
We made red, white, orange, yellow, and blue crystals. 
They were very bright. 
They sparkled in the candle light. 
SPRING 
Lake Shore—As soon as the weather is warm enough, a visit is 
made to the lake shore, for the purpose of observing and collecting 
stones. The children observe the action of the waves, the ripple-marks, 
the color of the sand, as well as that of the stones which they 
  TESTING STONES 
collect. The stones collected include limestone, shale, slate, quartz, 
greenstone, and granite. These stones are examined and identified 
with reference to color, degree of hardness, and reaction towards acid. 
Experiment—Shells, coral, bone, marble, chalk, egg-shells, and cement 
are tested with dilute hydrochloric acid te show lime content. 
The questions which come up in the study of stones are many 
and varied. Why are some stones smooth and others rough? Why do 
some sparkle while others look like glass? How do holes get in 
stones? How are stones made? What uses are made of stones? This
-P-A-G-E-30
Year Boox a 29 
latter question is carried far enough to bring out the use of stone in 
building and street-paving. 
Pebble-boxes of wood are made in the shop to hold the stone 
collection of each child. , 
Indian Life—At this season of the year, when nature fills the 
child with the desire to live out of doors, it seems fitting to study 
Indian life. The child’s mental imagery is strengthened through the 
use of many pictures, and his imagination stimulated through dressing 
as an Indian. He becomes for the time a real Indian and desires to 
know all that he can learn about the life of the red man. The first 
question considered is, Where would the Indian like to live?. Through 
pictures and stereopticon views, the place is sought where the Indian 
would like to live. The plains, prairies, mountains, rivers’and the 
country around Chicago are considered and compared as to their de- 
sirability: . 
    AN INDIAN HUNTING DANCE 
The food of the Indian is the next question. What animals did 
he use for food? Deer, moose, buffalo, bear, mountain-goat, and small 
game animals are thought of as supplying food and serving other 
needs of the Indian. The wild animals in Lincoln Park Zoo are 
visited. An Indian village is’ modeled in clay, including most: of the 
animals studied. The need of the Indian for clothing, for implements,
-P-A-G-E-31
30 Francis W. Parker ScHooL 
and for weapons is considered, and the children attempt to make 
weapons like those of the Indian. An excursion to the Field Museum 
is made, to get a clearer conception of the Indian’s way of living and 
the materials and methods he used in making. his weapons and tools. 
RICHARD’S STORY 
When we went to the woods I made a bow and arrow. 
I got a stick that would bend. 
Then I tied a vine to each end of the stick. 
I broké off a stick about a foot long. 
E tried to make a sharp point. . 
This was my arrow. 
The Garden—Beds for the planting of seeds are measured off 
and planned. The children plant corn for the second-grade chickens, 
pumpkins to be harvested in the fall and used for Hallowe’en, and 
flower-seeds including sunflowers, morning-glories, petunias, and mi- 
gnonette. ‘A: tree is planted on the school grounds, special trees are 
observed i in the park, and-some of them painted or drawn. 
1 Animal Life.—The birds recognized on our walks and excursions 
in the ‘park, are the robin, bluebird, blackbird, woodpecker, bluejay, 
yellow warbler, kinglet, flicker, and sea-gull. 
A: pair of ring-doves is kept in the room, and the birds are 
watched and cared, for: hy the children.’ The following reading lesson 
indicates the chatatter‘of. this work: 
Cy oa DOVES

They are gray. 
They have a. little black ring around their necks,

Then the little doves put their bills into the mother’s mouth to get their 
food. : 
Soon their little black eyes opened. 
Soon they had ‘feathers. 
They could flutter their wings. 
Now they are out of their nest. 
They cag, eat seeds, 
We give them water and seed. 
Fish, ‘snails, crayfish, and frog’s eggs are studied in the school 
room. An aquarium is provided for this purpose, and its contents are 
under constant observation throughout the year. : 
‘Other Activities—The play period has been utilized in digging 
caves in the playground, building a brush house, rolling snowballs, 
piling up blocks of ice for an Eskimo igloo, playing in Indian wig- 
wams, and building a brick house and oven. These activities are in 
keeping with the child’s powers, and they satisfy his imagination, as 
well as his desire for contact with real things. All’of this work fur- 
nishes much material for reading, writing, and dictionary. work, for 
which the children have come to feel a real need and interest.

THE SECOND GRADE 
  
All science work in second grade is social in motive. In scope it 
offers opportunity for the care of pets and the study of animals; for 
gardening and excursions; for the cooking, serving, preserving, and 
testing of food materials; and for numerous experiments with a variety 
of other materials. The science work also offers many opportunities 
‘for experience in the technique of-numbers, reading, writing, spelling, 
manual training, and the other special arts., One big project, the care 
of a dozen chickens, continues throughout the school year. There are 
a number of shorter activities, the first one being the preparation for 
a school fair, including exhibits of cooking, of summer collections, and 
of garden-products. Another activity is the making in clay and wood 
of a miniature Ringling Brothers’ Circus. As an aid to the modeling 
and painting of the animals, the children study the habits. of the ele- 
phant, camel, lion, tiger, giraffe, etc., in the Lincoln Park Zoo adjacent 
to the school. Colonial industries are studied, when the children are 
planning a colonial play and party for the senior class. The experi- 
mental work with minerals, begun in the first-grade, though not treated 
as a special unit, is nevertheless included in the solution of a number 
of problems. In principle, however, all the activities in second grade 
help to extend the scope of the experiences created during the work 
of the previous year. The work in detail follows. 
ACTIVITY I—THE SCHOOL FAIR 
The impetus given in first grade to the collecting instinct is stim- 
ulated further by the request at the end of the year that each child, 
during his vacation, make or collect something of interest to display 
at the County Fair in October. The children, therefore, return in the 
fall carrying packages bulging with materials ready for instant atten- 
tion. Necessarily, Fair work begins at once. 
(a) SumMMER CoLLections— 
1. Showing to grade collections of stones, shells, mounted insects, 
pressed flowers, sheaves of grain, walnut-hulls, sumach-heads, 
kodak-books, etc. 
2. Drawing pictures of places visited, relating experiences, answering 
questions, and exchanging information. 
3. Labeling exhibits and planning final disposition, as home, museum, 
grade use, etc.

(b) Fatt Harvest— 
1. In the garden.—Harvesting corn, sunflowers, and pumpkins in school 
garden. Selecting prize plants, digging up tallest cornstalk; 
largest sunflower plant, and longest pumpkin-vine. Collecting 
curious and interesting specimens such as blighted ears of corn, 
cobs with undeveloped grains, tiny silky ears, undeveloped pump- 
kins, insect pests, etc. 
2. Class work.—The garden work is followed, by several informal’ group 
jessons, so that children may have a further chance to ask ques- 
tions about their specimens and to show them to each other. The 
information gathered covers points something like the following: 
‘Cause of funkus growth on corn. 
How worms get inside the husks. 
Use of .corn-silk and of tassels to the plant. 
Use of prop-roots on cornstalks, of tap-roots on pumpkin- 
vines, . 
Why interior of cornstalk is. fibrous, while interior of sun- 
flower head is thick and spongy. 
Ways that insects destroy plants. 
3. Measuring the harvest—Husking corn with old-fashioned husking- 
pins; shelling and measuring corn for exhibit; seeding sunflower 
heads; measuring, drying, and measuring again; labeling pump- 
kins, for Halloween, Thanksgiving, home, etc. 
{c) Home Prers— 
Finding out kind of pets children wish to exhibit and planning ways 
of making them comfortable. 
(d) Mornine Exercises. 
Recalling and organizing interesting experiences in garden work for 
grade contribution to school exercise on Crops.* 
ACTIVITY II—CHICKEN PROJECT—FALL QUARTER 
Statement of General Management. The flock each-year is a new 
one, ordered by the children and paid for with money advanced by the 
school office until this indebtedness can be settled with money got from 
the sale of eggs. The daily work at the henhouse, for convenience and 
economy of time, is done through committees, children serving twice 
a day in groups of two. A special teacher always accompanies them, 
for though keen in interest, they are weak in judgment and experience. 
The committee reports to the grade each day, at a short period set 
aside for this purpose, but whenever a problem requires a longer dis- 
cussion, it is continued during the next science period, and when finally 
  
*Year Book, Vol. IV, page 24.
-P-A-G-E-36
YEaR Book 35 
settled, the task involved is again handed back to the group for execu- 
tion. For example, a self-feeding hopper planned by the grade is made 
by a committee in manual-training time. The children love this flexi- 
bility of method. They feel their problems are important and business- 
like. They perform their duties with sincere pleasure and remarkable 
carefulness and show in many ways that their dozen hens are a cher- 
ished possession. The order of the work follows:

following reports, written for the Parker Weekly, describe this 
experience: 
First we dig a hole, one yard wide and one yard deep. Then. 
we put a box into the hole. Then we put some straw and paper 
in the bottom of the box, and then we put the cabbage in. Then’ 
we covered it with boards. :

It is March. If we do not dig up the cabbage before it gets 
warm, it will rot. ‘So we went with Mr. Miller to where it was

tion of the new models. 
Barbara (reading). We found four eggs, two in the corner nest and 
two in the closed nest. Margaret's water-pan didn’t work. We looked to 
see if there was any straw in it, and there was much of it, right where the 
chickens drink. The straw had come inside where the water was, and we 
had to clean it out. (Continuing orally.) . After we cleaned it out and put 
fresh water in, we put a box on the ground and set the water-pan on it. We 
did that so the straw would not get in. I should think that the people-who

go out this afternoon would like to see if there is any straw in the pan. 
Margaret. I don’t see how the straw could get through. 
Barbara, I saw it. 
Jim, I will tell you how it could get in. The chickens were scratching 
around. 
Margaret. I know it could not have gotten, through the hole, because 
the hole is so small you can scarcely see it. It may have been in the can. 
Barbara, Maybe they kicked it in. 
Grade teacher. I think Margaret is right. The chickens could not kick 
straw into the can unless the child who filled it with water was very slow in 
putting the lid on, The real danger in her plan is that straw will get into 
the water after it flows through the hole into the open pan, and to set the 
fountain on a box was a good-idea. Philip, will you read your report? 
Philip (reading). We found a piece of brick and some sticks in the foun- 
tain. We asked the children not to throw bricks or sticks or anything in 
the fountain, because it might easily hit a hen and kill her. If we find any 
more, We will put up a sign. . 
Jim. They ought not to throw stones or sticks, because it might break 
an egg, you know. 
Grade teacher. I am sotry the wire fence isn’t higher. In the old run- 
way nothing like that could happen. Of course we can put up a sign if you 
think:i it is needed. =~ 
‘Miss’ B. We ought not to put up a sign unless it is really necessary. 
People will think we are fussy. Jim has something more to tell, 
Jim. It is important, too. You better not go .down that door by the fire 
escape, because we tripped there yesterday and cracked a whole egg. 
Grade teacher. Thank you, Jim. (Addressing Mr. M., who has just en- 
tered. the room.) George and Justin have made some models which they wish 
us to.see. May we use your period to hear about them? Perhans you can 
help us decide upon them. 
Mr. M. Certainly. I should like to stay. 
Grade:teacher.. George, you may show your model first. 
George (coming to front of room). Well, here are two pans. 
Mr. M. But what are you making; a’ cake? 
George. I am making a model of a water-fountain. I took two pie-tins 
and J took a can-opener, and I cut a hole so I could put a jar in and then a 
hole for the hen’s head, and then I got another tin to put under it. Then, in 
the pantry, I just got the right bottle to fit in there, and then with a knife 
I chopped a rough place on the edge of the bottle so the water could come 
out. Iam going to make this bigger and put more holes in it. 
John B. 1 should think if a hen put her head through the hole there she 
would cut her head on the tin. . 
George. But this is only a model. I am going to make a better one. 
Ann, If it were made out of wood it would not cut the hen. 
Justin. If you made it of wood, the little pieces of wood would fall 
off and get into the water, and the chickens, would drink them. 
.George. I could make it of two pieces of wood.
-P-A-G-E-40
Year Boox 39 
Justin, Then why don’t they have wood pipes in the city, if the wood 
would not break off? 
Mr. M. I will tell you something. A long time ago, in the city of Chi- 
cago, they had wood pipes in the street instead of iron pipes. 
George. They would rot. , 
Mr. M. No, so long as there was water in them they would not rot. 
But the city found it was cheaper and better to use iron pipes, 
Barbara. George, are you going to have glass in your real fountain? 
George. Sure. 
Barbara, But suppose (touching the bottle) it falls over and breaks? 
George. But the hole is not going to be so loose. 
Barbara, Don’t you see that wood is lighter than glass, and that would 
make it fall over. 
George. The real one would be bigger—it would look just li’: an aero- 
plane. . ’ 
Miss B. Mr. M., if this model were larger, do you think it would work? 
Mr. M, I think it would work beautifully. 
Grade teacher. George has done some good work, and I am proud of 
him. Justin is waiting to explain his picture. 
Justin, This is a pan with a lid on it, fastened at the top to a pulley and 
there is a spring down here and when the chicken steps on this spring, she 
pushes it down and that raises the lid, and when che gets off, the lid will clpse 
down again. 
Grade teacher. I once saw a grain-hopper that worked with a spring. 
Mr, M, If I were a chicken and saw a spring like that, I would not get 
on it. 
Justin, But there is going to be a board over it. 
Mr. M. Oh, then there is to be a little platform, and the spring is under 
the platform. How high is that platform going to be from the ground? 
Justin. Just as high as the spring will let it go. The spring will come 
up three or four inches. 
Gertrude, I should think the hens might be afraid. Chickens frighten 
quite easily, 
Justin, But the spring would not come up as quick as you think it would. 
It would be the right kind of spring. 
Jane. She might not have enough sense. 
Justin. But she would come there, and very naturally she would learn 
it. The hen would go there once in a while and she would get the water. , 
Henry. She would learn how to do that—like the closed nest. There 
is only one door to get in. She will learn to step on the board. 
Miss B. I think a hen very soon gets accustomed to a thing of that 
kind. 
John B. You ought not to have it up against the wall. There would be 
a row of chickens around, and they would get the water all at once. 
Justin, Tf it wasn’t next to the wall, it would be next to the fence. 
Mr. M. Suppose there were a number of chickens standing around the 
fountain, and they had their heads in that place drinking and the hen on that
-P-A-G-E-41
40 Francis W. Parker Scuoon 
board should step off? What would happen then? 
Justin. But they would never go there if it was crowded—they wouldn’t 
if it once happened. 
Grade teacher. Mr. M., do you think it is possible for Justin to make 
such a fountain? . 
Mr. M. 1 question very much whether the chickens will want to drink 
from that fountain. It might frighten them. I think Jane had the right idea. 
Justin, But they really wouldn’t know, because it would come down 
slowly. 
Grade teacher. Do you plan to make the fountain at home or at school? 
Justin. I will make it at home. 
Grade teacher. If Justin will make one, we shall be glad to try it, just 
as we are testing Margaret’s fountain now. 
Kendall. Well, what if the chicken comes along here and the spring 
doesn’t work? . 
‘Justin. But I would make it so it would work. 
Kendall. Well, see here. This is one thing—people make automobiles 
to run, but sometimes they don’t run, and it might be the same with the water 
fountain. 
Justin. But automobiles are not made with springs and cans. 
Grade teacher. I think, however, that Kendall’s caution is a good one, 
Justin. But every once in a while we would oil it up. 
» Grade teacher, The idea is certainly worth working on. Perhaps your 
father will help you make it. 
Jim, The chickens wiil be happy when we get all this done.

8. Observations on molting—For a week or so mount each day on 
paper the feathers brought in from the hen-house, noticing the 
color, size, shape, and number of each kind. Bring hen to class, 
and identify feathers on chart with feathers on hen’s body. Note 
way feathers overlap, and compare with fish-scales.. Note glossy 
appearance of coat. Compare with hairs on head, on hand, ete. 
Why is a chicken’s coat glossy and oily? 
Experiment—To show that sunflower seeds contain oil, in order to under- 
stand why poultry-men feed them at molting time. 
Apparatus necessary.—A test-tube fitted with a one-hole stopper and a delivery-tube; 
Bunsen burner, 
After putting sunflower seeds in the test-tube, heat the tube in the Bunsen 
flame and pass the gas which comes through the delivery-tube into a bottle 
of water. The children see that the gas condenses and forms a dark oil 
which floats on the water. 
Questions—Why is it necessary for a hen to have food which contains 
oil? How. does the oily coat protect the chicken against rain? How do 
canary birds behave when they are molting? Did the ring-doves in first 
grade molt?

doubt the hens have to grow accustomed to their new home, to the 
noise of the playgrounds, and to the many little people who care for 
them. The children, however, are impatient for the fun of gathering 
eggs, and after molting is over are constantly asking, “Why don’t the 
hens lay?” From various sources they learn that men who keep hens 
for eggs know the food-valués of different grains, that they stress the 
importance of feeding a balanced ration, and that they keep their flocks 
active and contented. Experiments with grains, reading-lessons on 
methods of feeding, and finally egg-marketing, which by February 
assumes the proportion of a flourishing business, constitute this term’s 
work with the chickens. 
(a) EXPERIMENTAL ProBLEMS wiTH GRains— . 
1. To identify grains used by poultrymen—Display butidles of wheat, 
oats, buckwheat, and heads of Kaffr corn. Let each child thresh a 
head of wheat in his hands, blow chaff away and observe the seeds. 
Repeat process with oats and other grains. Which grain is easiest 
to thresh? What foods are made from these grains? 
To find how many different grains the commercial chicken-food con- 
tains, distribute to the class a cupful of the mixed grain. Have 
the children sort it into piles, collect these separately, and so deter- 
mine the relative amount of each kind of grain. What grain do 
the chickens eat in largest quantity? Of what grain do we eat 
the most? : 
2, Testing grains for starch--Show laundry- and cooking-starch, and 
discuss uses. Let children make starch from each and starch 
pieces of cioth. Dry and compare results, Apply iodine test to 
lumps of starch and to starch solutions which have been made. 
Note chemical changes. Test for starch the cereals brought by 
children to school. Explain the effect of starchy foods on body. 
Is starchy food good for children? For chickens? 
3. Washing test—Washing-test to find which grains contain most starch 
and gluten. The materials used are wheat flour, rye, buckwheat 
flour, cornmeal and oatmeal. Divide class into groups, giving 
to each child a quarter of a cup of flour. Tie flour into piece of 
cheesecloth, and wash bag in bowl of water. Squeeze bags dry, 
open, and compare results. Which crumbles? Which is sticky? 
Which will puli? Explain what gluten is. Which grain contains 
most gluten? Which contains least gluten? Do our chickens 
need gluten? 
-Examine bowls of water and pour off the clear water. What 
remains? Pour all starch from corn-meal bowls together. Com- 
pare with results from other groups. From which grain did we 
get most starch? Least’ starch? Which grain do we feed most 
to chickens? Are we feeding wisely? ,

With great joy, the children give the first. egg to the principal, and for 
weeks after they eagerly buy the eggs for gifts to parents and to

  About this time an excursion is made to South Water Street, 
‘to watch the men candle and sort eggs, and to visit a cold-storage 
plant. In this way the children get a better appreciation of the 
value of a perfectly fresh egg and an understanding of the terms 
firsts, seconds, ete., as used in market quotations, which they cut out 
and bring to school, in order to help decide the selling price of their 
eggs. The following stories and poems were written this year for 
the Parker Weekly: ,

SOUTH WATER STREET 
We went down to South Water Street. A man opened a box of lemons, 
to show us how they were packed. There were some very big Spanish onions. 
We went into the rooms where they ripen bananas. It was very hot. We 
saw a man looking through eggs with a strong light. We took two of our 
eggs, and he said they were strictly fresh. The rotten eggs were black and 
watery inside, ~ Marcarer.

LETTER FROM A FORMER MEMBER OF SECOND GRADE 
Cambridge, Mass., Mar. 16, 1918. 
Dear Aunt M.—I have 13 hens. They Jay 6 to 10 eggs a day. Today I 
put in half a barrel of sawdust. The chickens cleaned themselves in it. In 
January, I got from 4 or 5 to 8 eggs a day. Some of the days when they laid 
8 eggs, the weather was 10 degrees below zero. The hens are all well. I 
want you to tell me about the chickens at the Parker School. I am getting 
more eggs than any of my neighbors. Love from, 
WALLACE. 
SPRING QUARTER 
The culminating feature of the chicken project should be the care 
of the baby chicks, But the thoughtful and systematic supervision 
given at the hen-house during the previous terms has never been pos- 
sible in the spring, and so, to insure safety to the chicks, and to pre- 
vent callousness on the part of the children, because of responsibilities 
inadequately performed, the entire flock, when the chicks are about a 
week old, is sold to children in the grade or in the school, and the 
chicks are sent at once to their country homes. The class, however, 
get much pleasure and profit from the experience of planning for the 
chicks and of watching them hatch. ‘

be large enough for air and comfoft, easy to clean, light in weight, 
and enclosed to keep laying hens away. Stationary receptacles for

water and grain are provided, so that hen will not get restless 
between children’s visits. 
2. Selecting Eggs—This involves deciding whether we shall. buy eggs 
or use our own; the saving of the largest and best eggs for the. 
setting, so that chicks may be strong and healthy; and finally de- 
ciding the correct number to put under the hen. mes 
3. Food—The problems. are: What constitutes the best food for a 
sitting hen? “How often should she be taken off the nest? For 
how long a time should she stay off from the nest? What daily 
exercise should she have? 
The following written* reports were made by the children to the 
- class on their return from the chicken-house. The brief written state- 
ments were of course supplemented by oral explanations. Growth in 
power of expression is very evident from quarter to quarter.

THE THIRD GRADE   
. The underlying. motive of the work in third grade is the be- 
ginning of the development. ofya civic consciousness. The preblems 
L which all the work of the year is based are as follows     
      
     “y Why did men start-a’ settlement at this particular place? 
“IL Why has:that settlement grown into such a large city in so 
/ Short'a time? ? 
: “swamps and prairies of one hundred years ago into the 
‘city of today, and how did they meet them? 
Iv. What problems: are there left for us to solve today and 
tomorrow ? 
In the solution of these problems, all the subjects are so closely 
inter-related that it is difficult to pick out any one and say, “This is 
science,” or “This is history.” In fact, some of the material in the 
succeeding outline has already been published as part of an outline of 
work on the history of Chicago. Its repetition here is necessary to a 
complete outline of the work in science. 
I. Why did men start a settlement at this particular place? 
From their readings in history, the children get the fact that 
the primary reason for the white men settling here was because it 
was a common meeting-place for the various tribes of Indians who 
lived in the surrounding region. This at once: gives rise to the ques- 
tion, how the Indians came to hold their councils here—a question 
that can be answered best by science, in the study of the physical 
characteristics of the country. By modeling this section of the coun- 
try in the sand- or delta-table, and by using a large relief-map of 
the United States, the children come to some realization of’ the 
accessibility of Chicago by reason of its situation. They also note 
that the various waterways were used as travel routes by the Indians, 
French voyageurs, and fur-traders. 
Within an hour’s ride on the train, we have a good reproduction 
of some of the physical conditions that existed in Chicago when white 
men first settled here. Therefore, a trip to the sand-dunes of Indiana 
gives us one starting-point for the science work. The abundant life

  A SWAMP AT THE DUNES 
in the swamps, both vegetable and animal, furnishes another obvious 
answer to the question, Why. did the Indians come here? Plants, such 
as the wild rice, besides furnishing food for the Indians, attracted 
the game birds in countless numbers; and the birds, as an abundant . 
food supply, in turn attracted the Indian hunters.

lected on the excursions. 
The following reports of various trips, written by the children, 
show how, by means of the excursions, the interest and curiosity of 
the children is aroused, and a beginning is made in training the 
powers of observation. 
OUR TRIP TO THE SAND-DUNES 
We went to Millers, Indiana, Friday, October 9. We met at the school 
at 7:40 that morning, and went down to the LaSalle Strect Station. It took 
us about an hour on the train to reach Millers. 
  GENERAL VIEW OF THE DUNES 
On the way, we saw some swamps and great quantities of tumble-weed. 
The leaves were turning red, and brown, and gold. Many trees were still 
green, and many of them were pine-trees. 
It was beautiful day for our trip. The sun was shining, and it was 
warm. We walked about a mile along the road to the lake. On the way 
we crossed the Calumet river. It looked very swampy. 
We climbed some dunes, and found a place to put our wraps. We then 
started out to see what the country was like. We climbed a high dune 
and saw the deep blue water of the lake, swamps, and sand dunes everywhere.

  FUN ON. THE DUNES 
We found wild grapes, colored leaves, and many different kinds of bone 
Helen found a turtle’s egg on the edge of the swamp. It was white and 
about one and one-quarter inch long. It was oblong in shape. Some of 
the boys saw a snake. 
After lunch we started to fish, We wanted. to get some things for 
our aquarium. Many of us had nets and the director had a dredge to use 
in the swamps. We caught crayfish, tadpoles, frogs, leeches, newts, rock- 
fish and minnows. We found the larvae of the dragon-fly. We think the 
dragon-fly goes through three stages, just as the butterfly does. We are

going to keep it through the winter and see if it will change. One of the 
tadpoles was a bullfrog pollywog. The other, we think, will change to a 
green frog with gold buttons. We caught two kinds of snails. One was 
an oval oblong, and the other a flat coil.’. We caught whirligigs, water- 
boatmen, larvae’of the May fly, and water-beetles. We also found four 
kinds of water-weeds. There was some wild rice in the swamp. Along the 
edge of the swamp we found gentians, the bottle gentian and the fringed 
gentian. Along the road we found prickly pear and witch-hazel. The witch- 
hazel had its flower and fruit on at the same time. 
We started home at 3:15, and had a very good time that day. 
CLARK ROAD 
We wentto Clark Road. We took the Illinois Central and then 
changed to the electric ‘car at Pullman, Clark Road is about two miles west 
of the lake,:and: southeast of Gary. We followed the road for a short 
.distance when. we got off the cars, and then turned north into the woods. 
We saw sonie ‘aldéf-trees on the way. We went to get insects for our 
aquarium, but the swamps were dried up. We had a good day for our 
excursion. The air was cool and the sky was gray. It was a good day 
for walking. Clark Road is very different from Millers. There are no 
sand-dunes there, but there are ridges and swamps, and swamps and ridges.   
RIDGES 
The ridges seemed to be all sand. We could see that where the railroad 
cut through. On top of the ridge the soil was black. We wondered how 
that happened. The trees were mostly oaks. The leaves were a deep red. 
Some were orange colored and some brown, We brought back many 
acorns. The second grade can use them to make acorn flour. Some of the 
beautiful green moss we gave to the seventh grade. We found some prickly 
pears. We brought back some of the fruit. The golden-rod seeds were 
just ready to fly. We saw some milk weed seeds, too. We found horsemint, 
, wintergreen, witch-hazel, rose-hips, false indigo, bird’s-foot violets in blogm 
and blazing-star on the ridges. We saw two bee-trees that had béen ¢ut 
down for honey. .., : 
. SWAMPS 
In the swamps we found swamp-reed and some wild rice stalks. They 
both grow ten ar more feet high. There were many cattails, and we 
picked some. 
The wind blew the seeds about in the air, and it looked as if it were 
snowing. The button-bush grows along the edge of the swamps. We brought 
back two birds’ nests that we found on the button-bush. One nest had a 
soft lining. It looks as if a little field mouse had made it. We found 
several cocoons. ‘They were the cocoons of the Promethea mo’ 
brought back some swamp soil. It was very black and fertile looking. ‘We 
are- going to. try to find out why. the swamp soil is so. different. from 
the ridge soil.

  ON THE RETURN TRIP 
We did not get insects for our aquarium, but we found out ‘many things 
about plants in the swamps and on the ridges, and had a very nice trip.

THE CADDIS-LARVA 
The caddis-larva has a little house around him. Sometimes his house 
is made of plant-stems and hollow seeds, and sometimes little stones, When 
his house is made of plant stems or hollow reeds, he lives in a swamp, but 
when his -house is. made of little stones, he lives in swift-flowing streams. 
When he lives in swift-flowing streams, he cannot swim much, but the 
things he eats come with the stream. 
The inside of his house is very soft. He has two or three hooks at 
the end of his body, and he hooks himself in. The caddis-larva eats smaller 
animals than he, and he is so juicy that fish like to eat him; and that is the 
reason he makes a house around himself. A hollow reed is not so good 
as a plant stem, because the plant stem hurts the fish’s mouth.

A TRIP TO SKOKIE MARSH IN MAY 
. Winthrop caught some leeches. We found many small crayfish. We 
caught some whirligigs in a small net at the surface of the water. We found 
many small oval oblong snails. We found fresh water shrimps. We found 
the Jarva of the caddis-fly. We heard-and saw frogs, We saw red-winged 
blackbirds, a sora rafl, and a meadow lark. We saw a scarlet tanager, 
red-headed woodpeckers, bluebirds, robins, and bluejays. We saw several 
garter-snakes. We picked spring-beauties, marsh-marigolds, a few purple 
and dog-toothed violets, hepaticas and skunk-cabbages.

LEECHES 
The leech has a little pad at each end of its body, which is used for 
sucking blood. Years ago doctors used leeches to draw blood from people 
who were sick, Occasionally they are now used to draw blood from bruised 
or discolored places, like a black eye. 
Leeches swim with a wave-like motion. To get around the aquarium 
without swimming, a leech fastens its pad at one end of the body to the side 
of the aquarium, stretches out, circling the loose end of its body about until 
it finds a place to fasten it, then it loosens the first end and again seeks a 
place for the loose -end.

OUR AQUARIA 
In‘ one aquarium we have some newts and snails. The snails have 
hatched some eggs. In another aquarium we have a mud puppy. One of 
the boys caught it in Geneva. In another aquarium we have a large, white 
French snail, French people like to eat them. Mrs. Carley gave him some 
lettuce, and he ate nearly all of it. He has now begun to hibernate for the 
winter. In another aquarium we have some medicine leeches, and they are 
hibernating for the winter and are under the sand. In another aquarium, 
we have a catfish, and he is growing. In our big aquarium we have goldfish, 
silver-fish, and minnows.. On the other side of the glass partition, we have 
a turtle, some small frogs, and a bullfrog, but we think the little frogs 
are under the sand. In a pan, we have an alligator. Virginia sent it to 
us from Florida. 
O. T. 
OUR BULLFROG 
Our bullfrog has not eaten all winter long. Last week I brought a 
little frog to school. We put him in the aquarium with the big bullfrog. 
Mr. Meyers came in to look at the aquarium, and he said to the bullfrog, 
“It’s about time you were eating something, old fellow.” And the bullfrog 
grabbed the little frog by the leg and swallowed him before Mrs. Carley 
could stop him. He pushed him into his mouth with his front paws. We 
think now that the little frogs which we thought were hibernating were 
eaten up. Today Mrs. Carley put a piece of meat on a thread and fastened 
it to the top of the aquarium. It fell into the water. When Mrs. Carley 
tried to pick it up, the bullfrog grabbed her finger and wouldn’t let go. 
Then he grabbed the meat and swallowed it. It is easy to feed him now, 
with the meat on a thread, as he just pulls it off.

The dune excursion gives a physical setting. From this follows 
the study of Indians’ homes and industries—cooking, hunting, fish-' 
ing. The result of the trapping and hunting of the Indians was a 
wealth of furs, which led to the coming of the fur-traders and the 
establishment of a trading-post and fort.

lynx, badger, bear, wolf, otter, mink, skunk, fox, squirrel). 
(b) Comparison and functions of teeth of various types of animals.— 
Incisors, canine teeth, molars. 
In taking up the study of the animals hunted and trapped for 
their furs, after a general discussion, ¢ach child is allowed to select 
one animal for intensive study. Numerous books are available in the 
room, and on the blackboard is posted a schedule of definite references 
to books, chapters, and pages dealing with each animal. So the: chil- 
dren are able to do a: great deal of individual work and find con- 
siderable pleasure in learning of the homes, habits, and characteristics - 
of the particular animal in which each is interested. Information 
gained in this way, is supplemented by frequent visits to the Lincoln 
Park Zoo, where the living animals are studied and sketched, and 
by the study of specimens in the Academy of Sciences. 
Another helpful feature has been the exhibit of furs (some skins 
and some made-up pieces) loaned by Marshall Field & Co. at various 
times. The children learn to distinguish the different furs and develop 
a real interest in the study. The heroic side of the lifé of the fur- 
traders and trappers, their courage and cheerfulness in hardship and 
danger, their resourcefulness in meeting difficulties, furnishes an ap- 
peal that quickly arouses.and holds the children’s interest.

- We tried to purify salt water. Charles suggested boiling the salt water. 
We did this, but it did not purify it, because it left the salt in the beaker, 
and the water evaporated. Then some one said, “Strain it.” We strained it 
with filter paper, but that only got it clear. It still tasted very salty. Win- 
throp said to catch the steam. So we took a saucer and held it over the 
beaker. The vapor gathered on the saucer. As the saucer was cool, the 
steam turned into water, The water was pure. .

THE FOURTH GRADE 
  
The fourth grade marks the beginning of a renaissance, as it were, 
for the normal child. There come, upon his mental and spiritual! hori- 
zon at the age of nine and ten, the dim outlines of a new vision. World 
consciousness is taking form. Because of this consciousness, there is 
a desire to stretch out—figuratively speaking, with both hands and 
feet—to get in touch with something new. To feed and strengthen 
these yearnings, in which lies so much mental and spiritual force, if 
but shaped aright, is the purpose of the fourth-grade curriculum. 
For this reason, Greek history, with its wealth of beauty in art, 
literature, and government, and world geopraphy, with its multitu- 
dinous avenues of information, are made in this school vital parts of the 
year’s work. The more immediate need of expansive fellowship is met 
by the school garden and grade pets. Reading, writing, literature, 
English, arithmetic, art, ‘clay, manual training, and eurythmics, are all 
closely correlated with these major interests. 
Geography, gardening, and the care of pets, are the studies which 
legitimately comprise the science work during the year. As much of 
this study as-is possible is made concrete through personal experience 
in experimentation. It is with the experimental phase only of the 
science work that this outline deals. The other phase, that gained from 
second-hand information, is outlined very briefly. This experimental 
work is so closely interwoven with the other work of thé curriculum 
that to formulate it into a detached outline, as is here presented, is to 
give a somewhat false impression. It is as if one were to pluck the 
aigrettes from the heron, and, holding them forth, to say: “Behold the 
plumage of this bird.” 
However, such an outline will arrange itself under the three divi- 
sions: 
JL “Problems arising from world geography. 
II. Problems arising from the making of a grade garden. 
III. Problems arising from the care of pets. 
GEOGRAPHY 
No textbook is used in the geography work of this grade. All 
information necessary is gained from reference books. (See list at end

of article.) Imaginary journtys in search of food furnish the motive 
for study. Cacao and meat are the two types selected,—they are taken 
because of their direct appeal and their wide application, Through 
cacao the tropical regions are covered, and through meat the temperate 
and arctic. Physical, locational, mathematical and anthropo-geographic 
points may well be developed from these two seemingly inadequate 
types. A large, loose-leafed notebook, of rough gray paper, is made by 
each child. This is the Travel Book, and in it are kept records of the 
trips, such as maps, time-tables, pictures of railroads, ships, peoples, 
homes, products, etc. : 
The first journey starts with the search for cacao. Preparations 
are made for the trip from Chicago to New York. The Great White 
Fleet steamer is used from New York to Jamaica. Observations are 
noted along the route and after arrival. A day’s visit to a cacao plan-’ 
tation in Jamaica is made. Full observations of the planting, growth, 
gathering, and preparing for shipment of the cacao beans are noted. 
At this point a real trip is taken to the Garfield Park Conservatory, to 
see a real cacao-tree. A second real trip is then taken to the Bunte 
candy factory, where are seen the full processes of making cocoa and 
chocolate. The amount of cacao beans used by this factory raises the 
question, “Does Jamaica supply the world with cacao?” Other regions 
similar to Jamaica in climate are searched for. The journey lengthens 
out through the Panama Canal, to Ecuador, across the Andes, down 
the Amazon, across the Atlantic, through central Africa, across the 
Indian ocean to southeastern Asia and the East Indies. Position, cli- 
mate, surface, differing products, people, and routes of travel, are all 
developed through this study. Several actual trips are taken to the 
Lincoln Park Zoo to see the animals that are met with on the journeys. 
Several big questions arise in this work that only the laboratory 
can answer adequately. The following pages, give the questions and 
the laboratory work involved: 
In the journey from New York to Jamaica, a child asked, “If we 
are out of sight of land, how does the captain know the directions?” 
A second pupil answered, “The compass tells him.” The first child re- 
plied, “But what is the compass, really ?” : 
Experiments—The Compass.—Magnetizing a needle and floating it.on 
water. Observing the direction which a suspended magnetized bar takes. 
Making a simple electro-magnet. Noting effect of electric current on. the 
compass. Using the compass to find directions in the room. Noting effect 
of iron in the room on the compass. Locating magneti¢ poles on world-map.

62 Francis W, Parker ScHooL 
“Having arrived at Jamaica, a pupil asked, “Why is it warmer 
here than in Chicago?” A second child answered, “Jamaica is nearer 
the equator.” But the first child retorted, “I don’t see what that has 
to do with it, besides, I don’t see why there are summer and winter 
anyway—the sun is shining just the same.” 
‘The work done to answer this question is given here in rather full 
detail, since its solving took many weeks and proved to have some 
rather wide correlations. : 
Experiment.—Changing Seasons. and Light Distribution—The school 
room was darkened, and with a globe, a stereopticon spot-light, a twilight 
circle, and a yardstick, the differing positions of the earth, with relation to 
the vertical ray of the sun, were worked out. The distribution of light, with 
the varying length of day and night, was observed. 
Several lessons were devoted to the summing up of the results of 
this experiment. Drawings were made of the earth in its different 
positions. Names were given to the four important positions: spring, 
summer, autumn, winter. The words solstice and equinox were intro- 
duced. 
Then the question was asked by the teacher, “You have made the 
statement that the vertical ray from the sun does strike the earth at 
different places during the year. How can you prove that this vertical 
ray does change?” From the discussion that followed, it was discov- 
ered that shadows changed length and direction with changing pusi- 
tion of the light; hence, difference in the length of shadows would 
prove the changing position of the vertical ray. Thereupon, it was 
decided that a shadow-record be kept. The plans for a shadow-board 
were worked out by the class, and the board was made in the manual- 
training shop by one member of the class. 
It was then found necessary to find true north on the school 
grounds, so that the board could be rightly placed—also, it was neces- 
sary to know the difference between standard and sun noon, as the 
shadows were to be measured at 9 A. M., noon, and 3:00 P. M. Ac- 
cordingly, each child, with a pin, a piece of paper, anda sharp pencil, 
recorded the shadows of the pin from 11:30 A. M. to 12:20 P. M. This 
work was done on long tables in the school garden. True north was 
found by the shortest shadow; the difference between the time indi- 
cated by the watch, at the taking of this shadow, and of true noon, 
gave the difference in minutes between standard and sun time. True 
north was compared with compass north, and the magnetic declination 
of Chicago was found.
-P-A-G-E-64
YEAR Boox 63 
  
  FINDING TRUE NORTH 
The shadow-board was placed according to directions, and records 
of the shadows at 9:00 A. M., noon, and 3:00 P. M., were made Mon- 
days, Wednesdays, and Fridays on the paper plates. 
The question then developed: If we can prove that the length of 
a shadow really changes in Chicago, how can we get evidence that it 
is at the same time changing in other places? The following steno- 
graphic report of the lesson shows the result of this inquiry. 
CLASS LESSON 
. January 16, 1918 
Teacher. We worked out a very satisfactory explanation for ourselves 
as to the cause of winter and summer; that is, satisfactory to most of us. 
A few were absent and may not understand it. Can anyone give, in a 
very few words, just what the cause of our winter and summer is? 
Parke. Well, in winter the axis, you know, is just opposite in the 
south to what it is in the north, when they have summer down there. That 
is because (goes to the board and draws a diagram), here is the sun, and 
here is the earth, and there is the axis, and you see, there is North America. 
And here, the direct ray of the sun hits the southernmost part of the earth— 
that is, throwing most of the light and heat towards the southern part of 
the earth. That leaves the north without so much heat. Here the direct ray 
hits the Tropic of Capricorn. 
Teacher. Can you tell, then, where the sun’s rays are hitting the earth 
directly now? 
Parke. Near the Tropic of Capricorn. 
Teacher. Then, what season are they having there?
-P-A-G-E-65
64 Franois W. Parger ScHoon 
Parke, They are having summer there, and here in the northern hem- 
isphere we are having winter. 
Teacher. Then let us take six months later. 
Parke. It would be summer here, and the sun would be shining more 
on the northern hemisphere. 
Teacher. And what causes the difference? 
Parke. In the winter, in the northern hemisphere, the axis of the 
earth is inclined away from the sun. The north pole is inclined away 
from the sun, and the south pole is toward the sun. 
Teacher. Some, not believing what Parke has said, might say this: 
“How can you prove to me that the vertical ray does change its position, 
as Parke has said it does?” 
Eugene. By a drawing. 
Teacher. That would explain, but not prove. 
Marion. I suppose most people would think the axis pointed in the 
same direction. You would have to show that by going around the sun, 
keeping the axis pointing the same way, using something to represent the 
sun and something else to represent the earth. 
Teacher. That would be an illustration, not a proof. 
Marion. We could use the shadow-plate. 
Teacher. How would that prove it? 
Marion. The shadow would show the way the direct ray moves. 
Teacher. But we've got to have a definite proof that the shadow 
actually changes its position in the south as well as the north. 
Eugene. We could. take a shadow-plate and ask someone to tell what - 
jt was on the same day in some other country. 
Teacher. How could we get a shadow-record that would represent, 
say, the southern solstice? 
Marion. If we could get word from that place. I don’t see just how 
we can do it, . 
Eugene. Send a letter to one of the men who takes care of the weather, 
and see what the weather is down there, and ask them to record it on a 
piece of paper or something, and then in a month send it to us because 
we are studying about it. 
Teacher. ‘That suggestion is excellent. But has anybody a criticism 
about using the weather-man? 
Jane, My father learns about things by calling up The Chicago Tribune, 
because they know most of the things like that—because they know the 
weather-men at different places. 
Teacher. That would be still getting the news from the weather-man. 
Is there any place where people might be interested in what we are doing? 
John. I know some people in California, 
Nancy. My aunt lives down in Houston, and if I wrote a letter to her, 
she could find out for us. We could send a night letter. 
Richard. Why couldn’t we write to some schools some place and tell 
them what we are doing, and ask them to make a shadow-record and send 
it to us?
-P-A-G-E-66
Year Book 65 
Teacher. Excellent suggestion. Those boys and girls might be just 
as much interested in recording the shadow as you are. If we could get 
in communication with some schools, what are the places that we should 
hear from, if we are going to get the real proof? 
Austin, J think we ought to send to Venezuela, or to Argentine. 
Teacher. Why would you select a place down there? 
Austin. Because it is south of the Tropic of Capricorn. 
Teacher. Let us make a list of the these places (writes on the board as 
pupils suggest). 
Benny. One at the Tropic of Capricorn. 
Pauline. At the equator. . 
Letha, At the Tropic of Cancer. 
Howard. Between the Tropic of Cancer and the equator. 
Alice. North of the Tropic of Cancer. 
Florence. That could be here in Chicago. . 
Teacher. Very good. Now what shall we do to get cities on these im- 
portant lines? . 
Alice. Use our maps. (Many hands up approved the suggestion. Long- 
man’s School Atlas opened.) 
Teacher. What map shall we use first? 
James. North America. 
Teacher. Who can give us the page in the Atlas? 
Carl. On page 9. 
Teacher. How can you recognize the Tropic of Cancer? 
Parke. By the dotted line. It goes through Cuba and Mexico and 
quite close to San Domingo. 
Teacher. Cuba is one island in what big group of islands? 
Nancy, The West Indies. 
Teacher. Is there any large city in the West Indies that we might 
-get into communication with? 
Parke. Havana, in Cuba. . 
Teacher. Now for a city on the equator. Does the equator pass through 
North America? 
Miriam. No, through South America.

. February 26, 1918. 
Superintendent of Schools, Para, 
State of Para, Brazil. 
Dear Sir: 
We, the Fourth Grade of the Francis W. Parker School, are studying 
about the revolution of the earth. We want to prove that the direct ray 
does change its position. We think we can prove it with your help. We 
have made a shadow-board and are going to keep a record of the direction 
of the shadow here. If we could get such a record from Para, we could 
see the difference in the direction of the shadow. 
The shadow-board is 18 inches square and 1 inch thick; it has a stick 
2 inches long and 34 inch in diameter, standing up in the middle of the 
board. . 
We have cut manila paper 18 inches square with a hole 3% inch in 
diameter in the center. We slip this paper over the stick on to the board. 
Then, on this paper, we mark the shadows Mondays, Wednesdays, and
-P-A-G-E-68

Fridays, at 9 A. M.; noon; and 3. P. M. On each line we mark the 
date and time. When the paper is full of lines we put on a new sheet. 
- If some school’ in Para could keep a record for March, April, and May, 
and send us the record at the end of each month, we would then have some 
real information about the changing of the sun’s position. We should be 
very glad to send our records if you cared to have them. 
Hoping, very much indeed, that one of your schools may be able to help 
us, we remain 
Yours sincerely, 
FOURTH GRADE. 
Copies of: this letter were sent to Havana, Cuba; Kingston, Jama- 
ica; Para and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; Buenos Aires, Argentine. Three 
replies have been received at the writing of this report. The results of 
the experiment are eagerly awaited. 
The manual-training teacher followed up this shadow-work with 
the making of pocket sun-dials and various contrivances for telling 
time. His report of the problem follows. 
A STUDY OF TIMEKEEPING DEVICES 
In connection with the science and geography work of the fourth 
grade some time in the shop was devoted by the boys of the grade to 
a study of timekeepers. 
The movement of the earth about the sun with the attention on 
the lengthening of the shadow cast by the sun could not very well be 
discussed without some reference to the use which has been made of 
this fact in various times and by various peoples as a means of telling 
time. This gave us a point of departure and reference was made to 
the use of the sun-dial in our own country in colonial days. The com- 
parison between the present and the past, between the watches and the 
clocks of today and the methods of earlier times offered a very profit- 
able field for investigation and study. 
In the discussion which arose it was found that nearly all of the 
boys knew about sun-dials. The sun-dial on the school grounds was 
familiar to all, and many had seen such primitive clocks in other 
places. The fact that in the time of Washington the sun-dial was still 
the common means of telling time was a fact which one of the pupils 
brought out through information which he had gathered in his read- 
ing. In Roosevelt’s Winning of the West was found a picture of a 
pocket sun-dial such as Washington probably carried when on his sur-
-P-A-G-E-69
68 Francis W. Parker ScHoou 
veying trips. An attempt was made to duplicate this, and each of the 
boys made one and tested it and found it would tell time approxi- 
mately correctly. Comparison of the sun-dial with the watches and 
clocks of today brought out the fact that while watches would tell time 
equally well, no matter where the watch might be, it was not so with 
the sun-dials, which must be made for a definite latitude. The dial 
could be used to tell time at any point on an east and west line, but 
carrying it farther north or south of the given latitude would destroy 
its usefulness. No attempt was made to go into the reasons for this in 
detail, merely calling attention to the fact that the nearer the equator 
a-person happened to be at certain times of the year, the more nearly 
would the sun be directly overhead. This would necessitate a difference 
in the slant of the gnomon or pointer of the sun-dial, and the angle of 
the gnomon would be-the same as the latitude of the place where the 
dial was to be used. This meant looking up the latitude of Chicago, 
which was found by consulting an atlas in the library. 
Attention was called to the fact that experts were needed at the 
time sun-dials were in common use, who could lay out very accurately 
the various angles needed, and that these men were called dialers and 
held a position similar to our watchmakers of today. 
Other forms of timekeepers discussed, to most of which the pupils. 
had found reference in their reading, were: time-candles; tarred string 
which was knotted at intervals, these intervals marking the time when 
the string was lighted or slowly smoldered; hour glasses; and water- 
clocks. A list of these was made and certain of the pupils volunteered 
to make some of the forms discussed. 
The water-clock offered an opportunity to trace the evolution of 
our modern clock and also provided a field for invention on the part 
of the class in the realm of physics and mechanics. A brief description 
of the method by which this was worked out might prove of interest. 
1. The Malay islanders used a: cocoanut shell to tell time. This 
had a very small hole in it and when it was placed in a vessel of water 
it gradually filled and sank, thus marking an interval of time. It was 
then emptied and set afloat again. Here the science involved was that 
of water pressure. An interesting class discussion as to the rate at 
which it would fill ensued, some pupils contending that as the cocoa- 
nut filled with water, the speed with which it sank would be increased; 
owing to the increased amount of water which it contained. The fact 
that the water which entered the cocoanut when it was nearly full
-P-A-G-E-70
Year Boox 69 
would have to push against all the water which it then contained meant 
that the rate at which it filled would be slowed down. When the cocoa- 
nut was first put to float, the water entering the empty shell would 
merely have to displace the air and would therefore enter more readily. 
This would also be increased by the added weight of the shell, which 
at that time was considerably above water. This weight, bearing down 
on the surface of the water, would naturally become less as the shell 
became submerged in the water. These were facts which various pupils 
brought out in the discussion, and. which one boy proved to his satis- 
faction by making an experiment. 
2. The Hindus improved upon this by using a copper bowl. The 
shape was similar to that of thé cocoanut, but the added advantage lay 
in the fact that bowls could all be made uniform, so that a standard 
unit could be preserved by several people. The same objection as in 
the case of the cocoanut shell still held true: namely, that the irregular 
shape of the vessel and the lack of.a uniform rate made it impossible 
to divide the unit into equal periods of measurement. 
3. The Chinese water-clock was an improvement upon these two 
methods in that the vessel was cylindrical so that, by placing one vessel 
above the other and allowing the water from the first to flow into the 
second at a constant rate of speed, it was possible to divide the straight 
sides of the cylinder into as many equal parts as desired and thus mark 
off uniform divisions of time. The pressure was kept constant in the 
following manner. 
     
   
  S= supply 
O= outlet 
E = escape 
Supply is greater 
‘than escape thereby 
keeping level in*A” 
constant and rate of flow uniform. 
At this point in the discussion, the class was asked to give some 
attention to devising means by which the amount of water that had
-P-A-G-E-71
70 Francis W. Parker Scuoon 
flowed into the lower vessel could be indicated outside of the vessel. 
Attention was called to the fact that our clocks have dials on the out- 
side by which we can readily see what period of time has passed with- 
out the necessity of opening up the clock. The following are some of 
the “inventions” of the various members of the class, some of which 
show considerable ingenuity. 
In this discussion the fact was brought out that the pressure of 
the water was the power by which the various indicators were made 
to move and that the size of the opening through which the water 
flowed was the escapement which determined the rate of speed. Some 
of the devices planned were adaptations of devices seen elsewhere, such 
  — 
as ihe oil-gage familiar on automobiles, and the water-tank seen along 
the railroad. Others were attempts to make the water, by means of the 
power which was stored in it, move hands in somewhat the same man- 
ner as the hands of our modern clocks move. The following drawing 
shows the attempt of one boy to solve this problem in the water-clock. 
The familiarity displayed with such devices as levers, floats, 
weights and the laws of gravity shows the interest manifest in these . 
subjects and proves the need of more work involving elementary 
physics in these early grades,-especially when this work is laden with 
a human interest, developed through their geography and history work 
and centered around some simple device, connected with the common 
every-day life of people. Carried on in this way and removed as far 
as possible from the realm of the abstract experiment of the science 
laboratory familiar to all students of secondary education, this science 
work can not help but have a vital place in the course of study of the 
elementary school.

As in much of our work, this study is to be presented to the rest 
of the school in the form of a morning exercise. Plans for this have 
not as yet been completed. Some suggestions which the class has made 
as to the form of this exercise are rather interesting, especially the 
suggestion that pupils taking part wear costumes of the people de- 
scribed in the exercise, such as the Hindus, Malays, Chinese, and early 
Colonials. Also the suggestion that Father Time have a conspicuous 
part, perhaps as announcer. 
At the present time, March 22nd, the study is not completed, but 
it is the intention to trace the evolution of the clock as we know it to- 
day from these early beginnings and attempts to divide the day into 
parts of equal length. This can not be done without a certain amount 
of comparison between.the value placed upon time in civilized and in 
uncivilized communities: This ranges from that of the lowest form of 
civilization, in which distinction is made merely between night and 
day or light and darkness, up to that of the modern day of the express- 
train and the aeroplane, with the stop-watch and the split-second 
chronometer. 
The weight-clock, the spring-clock and the electrical devices for

regulating and setting clocks and watches at a uniform time, by both 
wireless and telegraph, will all be touched upon before the study is 
complete. . 
While studying the climate of Jamaica, the question was asked 
by the teacher, “Why is there more rainfall on the northern than on 
the southern side of the island?” An understanding of air movements 
“ was necessary to answer this properly. 
Experiments—Wind.—Burning a candle underneath a raised glass fun- 
nel. Observing the direction of travel of the warm air. Observing con- 
vection currents by the radiator. Ventilating a room properly. Using a 
yacuum-pump to show pressure of air. General discussion. 
Experiments—Condensation.—Boiling water in flask over Bunsen 
burner. Watching condensation on upper part of the flask. Holding cold 
Mason jar over flask mouth. ‘Watching condensation, Meaning of vapor. 
Condensing vapor by passing cold water through parallel tubes. Boiling 
water with red rock salt in it. Condensing water—finding no salt, no color, 
in condensed water. General discussion of causes of rainfall and wind 
movement as indicated by these experiments. 
As the journeys continue, frequent repetition of the principles of 
seasonal changes and wind movement, in explaining the climate of 
regions visited, is made.. The pleasure of the class, in applying its new- 
found knowledge, seems to increase with use rather than to decrease. 
One child, in explaining the heavy rainfall on the eastern side of the 
Andes, in Peru and Ecuador, said: “My mother has been in the 
Himalayas, and she says there’s an awful rainfall there. And I sus- 
pect, here in South America, it is something like that. You remember 
that experiment we had in the laboratory, showing that warm, moist 
air condenses when it comes into contact with any cold object—well, 
that’s what causes the rain here in Ecuador and Peru. The warm, 
moist air, comes rolling in from the east” (sweeping his hand 
across the Amazon valley), “and when it tries to get over the Andes, 
it condenses.” 
The second geography journey starts in search of meat, with the 
questions: Why have we been asked to have a meatless day? Where 
does our own meat come from? 
A trip to the Chicago Stock Yards is made. The lines of im- 
portation of cattle, sheep, and hogs into the city are found out; routes 
are traced up, and sources of supply discovered. An imaginary journey 
is then taken to the great plains, and westward to the irrigated alfalfa 
farms. A modern ranch is visited. Chief centers of packing other than
-P-A-G-E-74
Yuar Boox 3 
Chicago are visited ; routes of shipment to eastern markets worked out. 
A shipment is followed to Europe. Chief centers of importation there 
are visited. Comparisons are made with other countries producing 
meat: Argentina, Chile, Brazil, Uraguay, Venezuela, ‘Russia, India, 
Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa. The journey is 
then continued to Australia as a typical meat-producing country. 
While there, comparisons are made with the chief non-meat-producing 
countries, such as Japan and China, and those producing a radically 
different kind of animal—countries in the arctic regions. : 
The science problems for this work have been covered in the cacao 
journey. A review of principles with different application is all that 
is necessary. This part of the geography work is developed in the 
spring quarter, and the time given up to indoor experimental science 
is now transferred to the garden, the real nature laboratory. 
GARDEN WORK (Agriculture) 
The child’s motive for having a grade garden this year is to aid 
in the conservation movement, hence all planting is to be vegetables. 
The outline of the work is as follows: 
(a) Sexps to Be Usep.—What vegetables are best suited to the garden 
space? Of these, which shall be planted so that the ground may be pro- 
ducing from spring to fall frost? Study of seeds, bulbs, and tubers; study of 
roots; study of difference between roots, bulbs, and stems. - 
“Final selection of radishes, lettuce, and onions for early garden; these 
to be harvested before close of school. Then beets, carrots, parsnips, parsley, 
and horse-radish to be planted in the same space. The second planting will 
grow with little care during the summer when school is closed, and will be 
ready for harvesting in October. 
(b) Som —What kind of soil is in the garden plot? Is it ready to be 
used. What is soil?—surface soil, sub-soil? Of what is soil made? 
These questions are answered by a review of work done during the 
preceding fall, when soil was examined and analyzed for window-boxes 
for the fourth-grade room, The work then given was as follows: 
Composition of soils--Mineral and vegetable matter? What is humus, 
sand, loam, clay, iron, lime? From where does the soil get these elements? 
Experiments—Mineral Study—-Making limestone by means of shells 
sunk in lime. Examining beach pebbles. Examining sand. Making iron 
oxide, 
The difference between limestone, sandstone, and granite was brought 
out in this work, One child wanted to know about igneous rocks, so a 
general discussion of volcanoes and their action ensued. Much interest 
centered in Vesuvius, Pumice, ash, lava, were examined. Then an arti- 
ficial volcano was made in the laboratory, using a pile of sand, gas, and

compressed air. This lesson was followed by stereopticon views of active, 
dormant, and extinct volcanoes. 
This work in soils is reviewed in the spring quarter, with the additional 
experiment of testing the garden soil for humus and comparing it with 
leaf-mold, loam, open field soil, and lake sand. 
Experiment—Humus Content.—Dry thoroughly samples of five soils to 
be tested: leaf-mold, loam, soil from open’ field, lake sand, garden soil. 
Take equal amounts of each; place in tins, heat red hot in the furnace. 
Weigh after burning. Note observations as to weight of ashes, Draw 
conclusions. Bottle samples of soil before and after baking, 
Experiment—Water Content.—Fill five glass tubes, stoppered at lower 
end with notched cork, with five kinds of soil, one kind to each tube. In 
a sixth tube, place dry, pulverized leaves. Have equal weight in each tube. 
Pour in water from measuring-glass slowly. Note amount of water ab- 
sorbed before water begins to run out at bottom. Chart observations. 
Explain film moisture or capillarity. Call attention to dry farming principle. 
From the above experiments, draw conclusions as to needs of garden 
soil, 
(c) Fertrizers——-Why are fertilizers used? How are plants fed? 
What are the chief plant foods? What are the chief fertilizers used? 
Experiment—Fertilizer—Making fertilizer from strong lye solution and 
meat bones brought from home. How should fertilizers be applied? 
(d) WorkING THE Som.—Spading, pulverizing, raking, applying fer- 
tilizer. . 
(e) Prantinc—Making rows; determining depth of planting (onion 
seeds and onion sets), thickness of planting, compact or light covering.
-P-A-G-E-76
  HARVESTING THE FIRST VEGETABLES . 
(f) Care.—Keeping the soil loose; sprinkling (amount and frequency) ; 
thinning; weeding. Charting weeds that are troublesome. Watching for 
noxious insects; noting appearance, habits, destructive qualities, and means 
of elimination. Gathering of vegetables and disposing of them (exception 
onion sets). Cleaning of garden ready for second planting. Planting beets, 
carrots, parsley, horseradish. Contrast depth of planting with earlier 
vegetables. Why should this be so? Making arrangements for care during 
summer. 
The affection bestowed by the grade upon this war-garden is evi- 
denced by the following writings from the class. 
~ WAR GARDENS 
“The fourth grade is making a war-garden. The garden is out where 
the swing used to be. We have planted radishes and beets and onions and 
lettuce, In the garden there are fourteen small gardens, and two people

work in each one, The way we planted our garderi was to take a piece 
of string and tie two sticks on it, one on each end; we put these sticks 
in the ground to mark our rows. Then we planted our seeds. When 
we got through with one row, we took the sticks out and put some other 
sticks in, These sticks had no string between them. We put them there 
so that we could tell where we had planted. We planted our lettuce in 
flower-boxes on the window sill in our room. When it got big enough to 
transplant, we put it out in the garden: Warwick. 
ek * 
To transplant the Iettuce in the garden, we used this method: we took 
a piece of wood, pointed at one end, and we hit it with a brick to make a 
hole about one inch. The holes we made two inches apart. After the 
plants were in the holes, we pressed the ground around them, and then 
we watered them. Pauline. 
* e * 
We are trying to do our bit in this war as much as we can. The 
government is asking us to plant a war-garden. The farmers are at the 
job, working harder than ever. Many of us are going to stay after school 
and work on our gardens. We want success in our gardens.

GRADE PETS 
From the care of pets, there come a breadth of sympathy and a 
sense of responsibility toward living things which no one questions. 
In fact, such a statement is itself trite in the light of recent school 
work. But the experience gained by the fourth grade the present year 
in animal husbandry and aquatic life has been a little unusual. It has, 
on the whole, been tragic. 
In the fall of the present school year, the aquarium was thor- 
oughly cleaned and. prepared for three goldfish, a turtle, and a mud- 
puppy. The means by which fish breathe, and the fish’s need for 
oxygen, were observed. Hence the necessity of keeping fresh water in 
the tank was duly appreciated. However, a violation of the rule not to 
overfeed the fish resulted in the death of two; then a sympathetic 
member of the class replaced these by two others. Later, an un- 
discovered trouble with the automatic supplying of the water caused 
the death of the three remaining fish. The mud-puppy and the turtle 
survived. The class immediately scrubbed the aquarium with Dutch 
cleanser and sterilized it with boiling water. At the present writing, 
the aquarium is ready for its new oceupants—types of spring swamp 
life. 
The following paragraphs, written by members of the class, will 
give the attitude of the class toward their aquatic experierices.

THE AQUARIUM 
Once upon a time, the fourth grade had some fish, but I am sorry to 
say that the fish we had once upon a-time are all gone, every last. one 
yes, every last one. But we are getting along pretty well. “Dr. ‘Lukens’ has 
given us some snails. and snail eggs, and some leeches, -and one of. the 
boys has given us two turtles, and we think we will get some. tadpoles. So 
you see, we are not so bad off after all. . Willard. 
* * © - 
We had some fish, but they did not‘ like us, the water, or the root, 
so they said they would not live with us, and died. * Frederick. 
* * * 
The animal husbandry was equally tragic. In the fall a call, six 
weeks old, was given to the class. Many hours of manual- -training 
work, in school and out, were necessary to the getting in order of ‘the 
little barn and runway. Many examples in arithmeticedeveloped in 
measurements. Short English lessons arose from the telling of the 
work. Unfortunately, the calf arrived at school at the time the milk 
famine arrived in Chicago. The calf demanded three gallons of milk 
a day—such a quantity was not to be had during the shortage. Cream 
was one day resorted to; evaporated milk another day. A careful 
mathematical computation-by the class convinced the children that, as 
one member wittily put it, the calf was going to bankrupt the class. 
So he was sold after three weeks’ ownership. But his price did not 
balance the milk account. However, much valuable information, as to 
how to feed a calf and what to feed, was obtained by the children. 
Also, good observational work was done in reading the thermometer 
when testing the temperature. of the milk and water. 
The Angora goat, which came later to take the place of the calf, 
required little care. Water, tested by the thermometer, was given him 
daily. Alfalfa was kept fresh in his box, and salt was tucked away in 
a corner of his stall. But one cold February morning, he broke the 
gate of his runway and disappeared! The story of these two pets was 
told by a member of the class in the following paper: 
ANOTHER SAD PET STORY 
The fourth grade of 1918 was very fortunate to get a gift of a pet 
calf. The calf was presented by Mrs, Seaman, but he drank so much 
milk a day that we decided to give him back. Mrs. Seaman said that she 
gave him to us. So we sold him. Even then he didn’t pay for the milk 
~ he had drunk. “Next,” said the fourth grade, and “next” did come. Russell 
Olson, being still fond of animals, brought us a goat. It was a cold 
winter morning, and snow was on the ground-—we found the goat was

gone! Our teacher said when she was on the bus she saw a goat, but 
did not think it was ours. When we.found it was ours, we went out to 
the goat-house, found its tracks, and traced it to the park. There we lost its 
tracks. Several times’ boys went out and tried to find him, but couldn’t. 
We notified the police. A policeman chased him down to Chicago Avenue, 
but there lost him in an alley. Gone! And he’ll never come back.

THE FIFTH GRADE 
  
As an experiment for the current year we undertook to do away 
largely with the arbitrary classifying of human knowledge and school 
periods into the conventional academic subjects; we planned to sub- 
stitute the study of what has taken the place of the home industries 
of town and farm, and of the quiet social delights of the home and 
plantation life of colonial days. In the curriculum, therefore, there is 
not the usual division into history, science, mathematics, ete. What is 
here gathered together is rather the science work selected out from the 
children’s activities,—to some extent therefore, separated from the en- 
vironment and correlations in which rest the mainsprings of motive 
and interest. . 
Im organizing the problems of the curriculum ‘iit is well to bear 
in mind that the method of work will have much to do with the choice 
and organization of the material. We are trying to train the children 
in initiative, to choose what they should do and to do it with all their 
might; to plan to meet difficulties and overcome obstacles by: thinking ; 
to co-operate and aid mutually without disturbing; to find informa- 
tion; to ask sensible and helpful questions; to open up a subject for 
further study; and to see problems and interesting things to do in the 
commonest circumstances of their daily lives. No outline of work done 
can ever be followed strictly by a subsequent class, since the initiative 
of the second class would alter the problems and the make-up of the 
class would change the mutual aid and interests. Work done by a pre- 
vious class never can appeal to a new group as an untried field does. 
Each year’s work should be different from every previous one. It is 
not to be understood, therefore, that all of the following is the achieve- 
ment of any one class within a year. 
The children’s initiative cannot start and supply all or even 
nearly all of the problems of the course. One of the greatest needs of 
training lies in educating pupils to find problems and recognize vital 
questions of lasting value in distinction from trivial questions that 
waste time and hinder progress. The teacher must, therefore, develop 
large and interesting problems with the class. The seven large type- 
studies that follow are intended to be of that character. 
Furthermore, there should always be a convenient opportunity for 
the pupils to offer whatever they will that they think is interesting.

-P-A-G-E-81

Such contributions are largely spontaneous in interest and initiative, 
since they grow out of what-the children think or do or read or hear 
in their leisure time. This material will come in as unorganized 
scraps or suggestions and toa considerable degree irrelevant to any 
other work. The teacher is usually too preoccupied with his or her 
own outline of work to give deserving and unbiased welcome to these 
distracting questions. Many of them do, nevertheless, connect up with 
the large type-studies and should ‘be brought into their proper rela- 
tion'to these. Others that are promising in value, even if they lead 
far afield from the teacher’s outline, should be given time and at- 
tention. Those that seem unlikely to lead anywhere should be side- 
tracked. ‘Finally a considerable number of such questions can be 
‘welcomed and answered in a manner satisfactory to the questioner 
but without taking much time, when the teacher decides they are 
not worth while to develop more fully with the class. Thus, one 
of the pupils announced one day that he was ready to explain the 
four-stroke cycle of the gas-engine. It developed into several lessons 
and started the type-study of the automobile. Many other problems 
grew out of these lessons. Another pupil brought a problem in con- 
struction of a meccano model of a derrick he had seen in use where 
a stone building was being constructed. The point was interesting 
and worth while but was not part of our year’s outline. Another 
pupil wanted to build a dollhouse. We saw most elaborate and 
interesting dollhouses on one of our excursions, but I did not see my 
way clear to encourage the making of the dollhouse further than giving 
a few minutes’ time to building with the wooden dometo or cement 
blocks. The problems in regard. to the torpedo, submarine, and net 
to catch the U-boats were welcomed but quickly passed by as they did 
not promise so.much as other questions before us. 
THE INDIVIDUAL PROJECT 
All starting is difficult, partly because the pupils do not at first 
understand what they are expected to do, and partly because most of 
_ them have no established interests, A child’s motives have a much 
narrower range because they are largely selfish. To develop responsi- 
bility it is necessary to make a pupil feel responsible to a group, to 
share what he knows and learns, and thus to be responsible for study- 
ing with intelligence. During the previous summer I hed corresponded 
with the members of the class and had asked them what they wished 
to study in the coming school year. I got them to tell me what they

did in their spare time. Later in the fall I asked them all to write 
what they would do if they had an hour a day available for individual 
work for a month. I also wrote ont-on paper many projects and posted 
 
-P-A-G-E-83

them for the pupils to see. I put a lot of meccano and erector parts 
within their reach, some of it in constructed models. Some pupils 
brought other:models that they had made at home, e. g., meccanograph, 
derricks, automobiles. I brought some partly finished jobs about the 
school to their attention and asked for volunteers. Also on excursions 
we always sought to find problems. Some trips were made expressly 
to see theproblems in the common things around us, such as the 
operation of the sucker dredge in Lincoln Park, the reproduction in 
models of the derricks in use where buildings were being erected. To 
find how these worked and how to demonstrate their operation led to 
  ENGINE RUNNING PLANER, BAILER, AND WINDMILL 
numerous problems of mechanical construction, (e. g., the grasping- 
tongs of a derrick, the managing of the ropes and pulleys on a swing- 
derrick, the construction of a sheer-leg derrick, that we saw at the 
plant of the Chicago Shipbuilding Company, and an adjustable swing- 
arm drill that we also saw there). -It is desirable to have the pupils 
tested: frequently for interests. and to ask their parents what the 
children do in their spare time: Thus I found one girl with an ab- 
sorbing interest in caterpillars. Another is genuinely interested in 
the structure of the bony skeleton. As she put it, she wants to com- 
pare the skeleton. of a monkey with the human skeleton. We are 
planning a series of visits to the Field Museum for her. These strong 
interests affect other children, and, soon they are caring to plan and 
to do'things likewise. 
Some children, of course, show considerable perseverance in their 
interests. Whenever I find that a pupil is voluntarily seeking for a 
chance to do some work, or.is working on a job outside of school, I feel 
pretty sure he will accomplish something in school. Thus, one boy got 
his idea in class and the next day produced a pair of tongs that he 
had made at home, out of wire. Another has followed up the study of

some of the constellations with an evening spent in star gazing at the 
school and is planning a school trip to the Academy of Science to 
see the Atwood Celestial Sphere. 
We started out in September by a general survey of the city, the 
street plan, landmarks, routes, and sections of the city and environs. 
On these first excursions much other material was collected for a start 
in individual-pupil projects. The class was organized for’ work on 
problems. Thosé with ideas and capable of independent work, were 
given great freedom. Those needing directions and capable of follow- 
ing directions, were given positions of responsibility as secretaries ‘and 
monitors. Those who showed neither originality nor responsibility 
were assigned to directed tasks under the leadership of other foremen 
or chairmen. Problems were written on cards and kept on file in a box 
until undertaken by a pupil. Projects under way were kept in a second 
box, and completed projects in a third filing-case.

The children reproduce what they see on excursions in drawings, 
models, and sand-table scenes. We use the meccano and erector sets, 
supplemented by extra pieces of tin and wire and building blocks. 
We build bridges, elevators, conveyors, boats, clocks, looms, derricks, 
sawmills, concrete-mixers, steam rollers, automobiles, steel skyscrapers, 
etc. We model in clay and paint in water-colors. We draw, model, 
and locate good examples of Gothic, Romanesque, Renaissance, and 
Colonial architecture. We collect and arrange in systematic order 
sets of specimens illustrating processes in the industries; also albums 
of pictures of Chicago scenes, and historical and geographical scenes 
in North America. 
We list the foreign plants in the park conservatories, the sources 
of the building materials in interesting buildings, the specimens in 
the Field Museum, the chief manufacturing centers in the United 
States. We collect interesting advertisements that tell things worth 
while knowing and that offer pamphlets with further information. 
The sorting and keeping in order of these papers, pictures, re- 
ports, specimens, and models, is one of the chief means of training to 
habits of order in work, and perseverance in study. The working to- 
gether on committees develops the ability to co-operate with others. 
Asa sample of the development and treatment of a larger prob- 
lem I shall take the one listed below as fifth in the outline of type- 
studies, 
The problems of machine construction for the children very 
naturally associate themselves with the automobile, as that is the most 
generally interesting and familiar machine in their environment. 
’ One day in the fall term our most versatile initiator announced 
his readiness to give the class a talk on the four-stroke cycle of the gas- 
engine. While I welcomed the subject, I was still surprised at the 
clearness with which he developed his points through chalk diagrams: 
intake, compression, power, and exhaust strokes. The essential differ- 
ences between the internal combustion engine and the steam-engine 
came out pretty clearly. Other problems likewise opened up: Why do 
you have to crank a gas-engine? What are spark-plugs? What is the 
carburetor for? How does it. work? What is evaporation? What is the 
cut-out?: What does the muffler do and how does it work? In what 
ways does the steam-engine differ from the gas-engine?’ What is 
thé reason the gas-engine has so many cylinders while the steam-engine 
haiéiilyone?. “Why: does not:the steam engine need cranking? Why does the steamer have an advantage on starting on a hill? What is the

    PROBLEMS IN AUTOMOBILE CONSTRUCTION 
arrangement of valves in the steam-chest? We had a toy steam-engine 
that we operated in the room and it showed the valve action pretty 
well. It also demonstrated the need of the flywheel. : 
We have Dyke’s Cyclopedia of the Automobile with excellently 
clear diagrams, but all working parts that we can bring into the class- 
room or demonstrate on the running car when on school excursions, we 
use. : 
One of the boys made one of the simpler automobile models out of 
meccano. It had no differential. It took several lessons before the 
class took hold of the problem at all. I found they had never realized 
in their thinking any problem at all in making the driving-wheels turn 
a corner. One pupil thereupon built a rigid crown-gear drive to a 
single back axle and demonstrated what it could do and could not do 
in turning a corner. This performance was contrasted with the con- 
ditions that they all knew exist in any automobile whose rear wheels 
turn independently of each other. Quite a number of the class made a 
point of visiting the automobile show in the Coliseum to investigate 
special problems in the dissected demonstration chassis. One of our 
ablest mechanical geniuses has since constructed out of meccano parts 
a good working model of a regular automobile differential that shows 
perfectly how it is possible to transmit power.to both wheels at the 
same time or to shift the power to either driving-wheel automatically 
as the car turns to the left or to the right. How is this managed when 
a steam locomotive goes around a curve? 
The problems of the headlight, of the lighting system, of the 
generator, of the starting motor, of the speedometer, have come up 
and are within the children’s interest and comprehension to a con- 
siderable extent.
-P-A-G-E-87
86 Francis W. Parker ScHoon 
The universal joint is one of the most interesting and generally 
useful of the mechanical problems of the driving-shaft. It can be 
completely demonstrated by meccano construction. The chain-drive, 
the transmission-gears, the camshaft that operates the intake and 
exhaust-valves, the link-chain speedometer, driving-shaft and the 
flexible transmission of power from wheel to wheel by coiled spring 
enclosed in a flexible tubing furnish absorbing problems of interest 
and value. 
The construction of the carburetor can be made reasonably clear 
by dissected models. 
One of the boys took up the problem of the construction of the 
air-pump and took a pump apart to learn its internal construction. | 
Although it took him a good while to do the work he got a good deal 
out of it, as it was the first time he had ever taken any machine to 
pieces. Jts action in pumping air is yet to be compared with the 
action of a water-pump in raising water and of a force-pump in 
delivering water under pressure in a pipe. We shall make models of 
both and have already visited pumping-stations. 
In the fall the class went on excursions to see gas engines at 
work cutting silage: and filling silos. 
The work on the gas-engine has raised the question of the inven- 
tion of the steam-engine and its effect on transportation and industry. 
The older methods of travel on foot and by horse and wagon, by row- 
boat and sailboat, are pictured and the effect on communication and 
travel is worked out. The fact that we are in an age largely dominated 
by the gasoline motor and electrie motor is made clear. Thus, too, 
the great change known as the industrial revolution from the home 
industries to the factory system is illumined and seen from a different 
connection beside that of the development of the spinning and weaving 
mills under Type-Study No. II, Teatiles. 
TYPE STUDIES 
I. .Farming.—This study is carried out by work in the school 
garden, by visits to farms, by classwork in recitations, by the making 
of models of farm machinery in the meccano sets, by excursions to 
museums and the International Harvester plant. 
Fati.—Harvesting, corn-cutting, silo-filling, winter wheat. 
Winter.—Soils; plowing; harrowing; planting; cultivating; rainfall 
and snowfall in relation to winter and spring crops; relation of farming 
to other industries, and its relation to the winning the war.
-P-A-G-E-88
Year Boox 87 
Sprrnc.—The farmer’s fight with insects and weeds; spraying and 
hoeing; the testing-boxes; seedlings; germination; garden work. 
II. Tea«tiles—In this study we have made seven different sorts of 
hand-looms, spindles and distaffs, warping-frame, cord-machine for 
doubling thread, spinning-frame for hand-spinning; we have raised 
cotton, flax, and hemp in the school garden; we have retted and 
scutched and hackled the flax; we have spun on the hand-spindle and 
spinning-wheel ; we have woven designs into cloth; we have visited the 
Hull House Museum and the Field Museum. This study is reported 
in Year Book Vol. IV, 1915. 
  MECCANO LOOM AND DOUBLER 
III. Wheat—In this study of the grains we take corn as the 
type, because of its size and abundance, to show the type features of 
a grain, in flower, stem, and leaf; we visited the flour-mill and ‘we 
made a school model of a flour-mill; the bread-making in the domestic 
science room is followed by a visit to Schulze’s bakery. The study of 
the wheat harvests of the world throughout the year reviews the 
seasonal relations of the great wheat areas and the mutual interest 
of all mankind in the world’s bread production and bread rationing 
during the Great War. This study is reported in Year Book Vol. 
IV, 1915. 
IV. Chicago Industries—A different industry is studied inten- 
sively each year, the other chief industries sufficiently for purposes of

comparison and to understand Chicago’s commerce, with the trade 
routes to and from Chicago. Thus, while we are studying ship-build- 
ing in detail as a type, the other great industries of iron and steel, 
lumbering, furniture: manufacturing, meat-packing, and the making 
of farm machinery, are related to the ship-building, and the goods 
brought to Chicago and those sent from Chicago are listed and studied. 
V. Automobile—The four-stroke cycle gas-engine; the compari- 
son of the gas-engine with the steam-engine; the problems of the 
driving-wheels (differential), of the main drive-shaft (the universal 
joint), of the maintenance of engine-speed (the transmission), of the 
steering wheels (the steering knuckles) ; the changes in transportation 
and relation to the industrial revolution. — 
VI.- Cattle—The cow is studied as a type of domestic animal as 
well as of animals in general. Hence the study involves the general 
facts of animal life and particularly the relationship of the lower 
animals to man, animal products and animal training. 
VIL. Problems Growing Out: of History and Geography.— 
Demonstrations that the earth is round; how to locate a ship’s posi- 
tion on. the,trackless waste ‘of-the ocean; how. to determine latitude 
and longitude; use of the astrolabe ; change of seasons north and south 
of the- equator ; movements of the sun, moon, and the constellations ;

THE SIXTH GRADE 
  
The central topic of study in this grade is transportation. Both 
land and water travel are studied and as much of the historic back- 
ground as is necessary for the understanding of present-day condi- 
tions is taken up. It is hoped that the outcome of this study will be 
a knowledge of the development of methods of transportation from 
the ernde log boat and the dog-sledge to the modern steamer and 
locomotive, with some idea of the changing social and economic con- 
ditions which accompanied the opening up of roadways and the change 
in methods of travel. 
Many of the problems related to the central topic are worked out 
in detail in the science and the manual-training departments. For 
example, the evolution of the means of propulsion of watercraft from 
hand-power to steam, gas, and electric power is studied, and models 
of the various types of boats of different historic periods are made in 
the woodshop. The effects of heat on liquids, the conversion of water 
into steam, and the use of steam, as motive power are topics worked 
out in the science classes where use is made of the laboratory and its 
equipment. A survey of the early methods of trail and road-making 
introduces the bridge and its influences, a topic which is studied ‘in 
detail in the shop. Here the primitive bridge, its modifications after 
the wheel came into general use, the development of the modern struc- 
ture and the modifications it has undergone in adaptation to special 
needs are studied, and models are made of representative types. 
Whenever the grade discussions bring up topics which can best 
be handled in the laboratory or which require special treatment, they 
are worked out under the guidance of the science teacher. Since the 
interest of the pupils always determines the choice of topics, no two 
groups of sixth-grade children have had identical experiences in gen- 
eral science; the following topics, however, will give an idea of the 
field that is covered through a study of transportation and will show 
how the parallel science course clarifies and intensifies the central 
topic. : : 
I. A survey of early water transportation. Exhibits of primi- 
tive boats in the Field Museum are studied, and models made of special 
types. Buoyancy, and weights of various liquids are the related 
science topics. 
"89
-P-A-G-E-91
90 Francis W. Parker ScHooL 
IJ. Beginnings of ocean travel. Science topics; the mariner’s 
compass, magnetism, the North Star as an aid to navigators. 
III. The class becomes familiar with the leading steamship 
companies by a study of newspaper advertisements and of the bulletins 
furnished by the various companies whose offices the children visit. 
IV. The foreign destinations and routes of travel are studied, 
and the influence of ice upon the location of these routes is noted. 
The problems arising from this study which required fuller treatment 
than could be given by the grade teacher were: Why can icebergs 
live so long? Why does the larger part of the berg float below the 
water? Where do ships encounter the greatest danger from bergs? 
Why are the North Pacific routes not hindered by icebergs? Why are 
icebergs often hidden by fogs? How are sailors warned of the near- 
ness of ice-fields? Science topics: Evaporation and condensation, 
the effects of heat and cold upon metals, the principle of the marine 
thermometer. 
V. The structure and size of modern vessels. The science topics 
studied are'steam, its uses, the turbine, and reciprocating-engine. 
VI. The big ship-building centers and the reasons for their loca- 
tions. The related science work is a study of coal, limestone, iron, 
~ steel, and oil. 
VII. The readjustment in world commerce as wooden boats 
were displaced by steel vessels. 
VIII. The invention of the screw-propeller and its influence on 
ship-building and commerce. Science topics: Principle of the pro- 
peller as applied to boats, aeroplanes, etc. 
It is not the plan of the science department to adhere strictly to 
the curriculum, as outlined in this report. Whenever the children 
have made experiments outside of school or have discovered facts which 
interest them, they are encouraged to make a presentation of their 
experiments or set forth their ideas to the class. During the year 
several of the children became so interested in this sort of investigation 
that they fitted up simple laboratories at home. 
In order that the science experience may make a lasting impres- 
sion, wide use is made of models. Such models the children make out 
of clay, wood, meccano, or other materials. During the school year, 
each child has an opportunity to make seyeral of these models, which 
are used in class demonstration and in morning exercises. 
In the hope of arousing in each pupil a feeling of responsibility
-P-A-G-E-92

for contributing to the body of science knowledge acquired by the 
grade, a definite amount of time per week is given to silent reading on 
topics under discussion. Hach child is provided with a printed list of 
references, from which he may make his own selection. The titles of 
these articles were reworded by the teacher to make them somewhat 
suggestive of material to be found in the article. The books and 
magazines so used are kept on the’reference shelf in the grade room, 
and may be taken owt for home use. Hach pupil keeps a record of 
the reading done, and makes a brief criticism on the.helpfulness of the 
article or on his readiness to recommend it to others. 
Many children have shown a tendency to read articles directly 
connected with class discussion, while others have preferred reading 
at length on some topic of particular interest to the individual. For 
example, one pupil has read all of the articles on magnets and per- 
formed for the class some suggested experiments, while another is 
reading all the library has to offer on the subject of flying machines 
and airships. A page from the reference list, with the children’s com- 
ments, is appended.

The principal topics, with some of the detailed experiments 
carried on in the laboratory as part of the sixth-grade work, follow. 
It is not to be understood that these are the only experiments given, 
but that they are fairly representative of the work. 
I. Primitive Boats—The first problems which arise are: Why 
do ships and other bodies float? Why does a steel ship float while iron 
sinks? How are skin boats and floaters made? ‘T'o answer these ques- 
tions, buoyancy is studied and the weight of various liquids compared. 
(See under V. The Study of the Steamboat.) 
A further problem is: How do fishermen at sea obtain a supply 
of fresh water? , 
Experiment—Freeze both salt and fresh water; taste both liquids and 
ice from each. Note results and answer questions. (It must be remembered 
that the flow ice may have been glacial ice.) 
Another problem is: Since ice comes from water, why does it float 
rather than sink? 
Experiment.—Freeze water in a test-tube, a sealed Mason jar, or a closed 
‘can, Note results and formulate a rule about the behavior of water when 
it changes to ice.* 
“Certain of these experiments may be left for a time later in the year, when the temperature is right.
-P-A-G-E-94
Year Book 93 
Il. Beginnings of Ocean Travel—tThe questions which present 
themselves are: How did early navigators know their directions at 
night or when they were out of sight of land? How did the invention 
of the mariner’s compass solve this problem? How is the mariner’s 
compass made and used? 
Experiment.—Let each child take a common sewing-needle and float it on 
a cork in a vessel of water. What direction does the needle take? Rub the 
needle on a magnet to magnetize it, and again float the needle. Compare 
this result with the first, and also with the compass. Suspend a bar-magnet 
in the room by means of a thread and wire stirrup and again compare 
with compass. -Do other substances besides iron and steel become mag- 
netized ?* . ; 
Experiment—By means of a magnet with marked ends, identify the 
ends of a floating magnetized needle. Also identify ends of the compass- 
needle in the same way. 
Experiment—The electro-magnet. Place a compass in a coil of wire 
and pass an electric current through the coil. Let the children see that 
an iron magnet is not necessary to set up a magnetic disturbance. Discuss 
the uses of electro-magnets. 
As an outcome of the study of the electro-magnet, one of the

boys devised an electro-magnet crane and another planned an electric 
reciprocating engine.* 
AN ELECTRO-MAGNET CRANE 
The electro-magnet crane is a new invention for lifting steel and iron 
without fastening. The principle on which this works is an electric current 
circling in an insulated wire, which is wrapped around a piece of soft iron. 
Some men think a piece of iron or steel is made of little particles, which 
have two poles, a north and a south pole. These little particles cannot be 
seen even under a very powerful microscope. These poles, before the cir- 
cling of electricity, are all facing in different directions, but while the elec- 
tricity passes around it, the north poles all face in one direction and create 
a power to draw steel or'iron. The reason steel is not used for an electro- 
magnet is because once steel. becomes magnetized it stays magnetized for 
a long time, but iron loses all magnetism as soon as the current is broken.

III. Steamship Lines—This topic has no related laboratory 
work, : 
IV. Influence of Ice on Steamship Routes——Why do fogs occur 
about icebergs? In order to solve this problem, it is necessary for the 
children to know something about evaporation and condensation. 
Afterwards, application of these topics is made to the distribution of 
rainfall over the earth. : 
Experiments—Heat equal amounts of water in an open dish and in a 
test-tube. Which requires the longer time for evaporation? -Hold a cold 
plate over vapor coming from heated water. Let water vapor from a 
warm teakettle enter an ice-cold Mason jar. Distill some water. Observe 
all the changes in these processes. . 
A discussion following these experiments enables the children to 
explain why mist and fogs occur about icebergs. 
Why does it rain much on the windward side of high mountain 
ranges and but little on the leeward side? Why do we have snow- 
capped mountains in desert regions? A relief-map of the world is 
put before the class. The direction of the prevailing winds is given 
and the pupils are asked to predict as best they can the relative rain- 
fall of various parts of the earth. Their predictions are checked by 
reference to a rainfall map in Longman’s Atlas. 
It is logical to follow the discussion on evaporation and conden- 
sation with a brief study of the effects of heat upon gases and solids. 
Experiments—Fit a flask with a rubber stopper and a U-tube containing 
mercury or water. Heat the flask and note expansion of air. 
*Most of the children have erector outfits and are inclined to use them as a means of demonstration.

Arrange a copper rod in. a circuit with an electric bell so that the 
bell rings upon the contact of the copper rod as it lengthens when heated. 
The children may be asked to devise thermometers and fire-alarms 
in which the principle of expansion of solids when heated is involved. 
. They can construct such thermometers or alarms and use them in a 
class. demonstration or in a morning exercise. During the year 1917- 
18, the children planned a number of marine thermometers and pre- © 
sented the morning exercise which follows:

Thompson. One of the most northerly. Atlantic steamship routes is 
that of the Allen Line, which ruas from Montreal and Quebec (pointing to . 
the map) up through the mouth of the St. Lawrence, past the northern 
coast of Newfoundland, and across the Atlantic to the British Isles. It 
is from twenty to one hundred miles. shorter than any other route, and 
saves about a day in time. This route cannot be used except in the winter 
months on account of the icebergs. In the winter, all this region (pointing 
to the map) is a mass of ice, but in summer the lower part melts away, 
which frees the upper part, thus giving it a chance to break up and come 
down. These floating masses are called icebergs. Since the Titanic dis- 
aster, a great many investigations. have been made about icebergs and 
their movements. This morning, we will tell you about the results of 
sothe of these investigations. 
Beatrice. When the sailors see great masses of floating ice, they are 
able to recognize two kinds of icebergs. One is very level, just like 
the top of a table; the other sharp and irregular, extending out of the 
water like*a spire. The first is formed. on the water and the other on the 
land. When ice is frozen. on a fevel surface, it is always level; though it 
may be many feet deep. So the level ice is that which is frozen on the 
surface of the northern seas and floats off in large fields when the warmer 
weather causes it to break up. The land ice differs from that formed on the 
water, because it is frozen on an irregular surface. So instead of being 
level, it is rough and uneven. As land ice is formed under great pressure, 
it is also harder and bluer in color than water-ice. 
William. Greenland is the largest body of land north of the arctic 
circle. On Greenland there are perpetual snows. It will snow and’ then 
thaw, and these thaws are sometimes followed by sudden freezing, which 
converts the snow into ice. This is repeated unti{ there is an ice-sheet over 
the country many feet in depth. This is sometimes called the continental 
ice-sheet. This-ice-sheet’ starts to move towards the coast. What causes 
this. movement no one knows, but. there are several theories. One is, that 
when ice is frozen under great pressure, it will flow like thick tar. Another
-P-A-G-E-97

.theory is that in winter the ice contracts and in summer it expands and 
these changes cause a slow forward movement. Ice, in the interior of the 
country, moves about. seven inches a day, while near the shore it moves 
much more rapidly,—about thirty or forty feet a day.. The rate of move- 
ment depends upon the steepness of the slope and upon the temperature. 
During Greenland’s short summer of two or three months several thousand 
icebergs are discharged into the sea. 
Lambert. When the moving mass of ice has crept to the sea, the 
formation of the coast determines the way in which it will break off to be- 
come an iceberg. If the coast is high, and steep, like this (sketching on the 
blackboard), the ice-sheet moves forward, pushing the end beyond the cliff 
until it becomes so heavy that a great mass breaks off and falls into tne 
water below. If the coast has a long, gentle slope, like this (sketching), the 
moving glacier follows the slope and may go some distance under the 
surface of the sea. As ice is lighter than water, the water always tries to 
buoy it up and at last a berg breaks off, rises, and floats away. 
Since ice is not very much lighter than water, a large part of the berg 
floats beneath the surface. In this vessel of colored water I have placed 
a piece of ice and a piece of cork. The piece of cork is very light, so that 
only a small part of it is beneath the surface. The ice is almost as heavy 
as water, so that only a very small part of it is above the surface, about 
seven-eighths of it being under water. 
Katherine. After the iceberg has broken from the glacier, it stays 
around the coast fora long time. There are two forces which finally cause 
it to go out to sea—the wind and the current. When the iceberg ex- 
tends several hundred feet above the water the extended part acts just 
like a sail. The wind catches it and blows the berg down to the sea. The 
current, which helps in this work is the Labrador current, in Davis Strait. 
The icebergs Are caught in this current and carried down into the paths 
of commerce. While confined between the shores of Greenland and Canada, 
this current flows very steddily and swiftly, but when it gets to the ocean, 
it spreads out like a fan, part of it following the coast of Labrador and 
the other part moving outward toward the east. Thus this current carries 
some icebergs to Labrador and down our Atlantic coast to the Gulf of St. 
Lawrence, while others are carried out into the ocean. 
James, Just off the southeast coast of Newfoundland, in the vicinity 
where the Titanic disaster occurred, many icebergs are often held together in 
a kind of jam. This is due to the action of the current, The Labrador 
. current brings the bergs down along our eastern coast, and when it spreads 
out some of them are carried.out to sea. The Gulf Stream comes up from 
the south, and in this part of the ocean (pointing to, map) the two currents 
meet. Where the two currents push together with the same amount of 
force, the icebergs are held in a jam, which sailors fear very much. 
Philip, After an iceberg gets into the Atlantic, it lives for a considerable 
time. -It may live many months, and some bergs have been known to exist 
for two or three years. There are several reasons for this. One is its 
enormous size, and another is that on account of the hardness of glacier 
ice, from which the berg was formed, it will not melt readily. The third
-P-A-G-E-98
‘Yzar Boox . 97° 
reason is that icebergs do not often travel singly, but in fleets. At certain 
seasons thy break off and many come down into the ocean at the same time. 
The most advanced bergs cool both the water and the atmosphere around 
them, so that the sun cannot easily affect them. Another protection to the 
berg is the fog which forms around it, and keeps off the rays of the sun: 
Later, Robert will perform an experiment showing how this fog is formed. 
Ward. If an iceberg were not carried south by the wind and current, 
it would live a greater length of time than it usually does. The temperature 
of the air and water around Greenland is very cold, and therefore the ice- 
berg would havea chance to exist for a long time. But as the iceberg is 
carried south, it soon comes to a warmer climate. The air about the berg 
is then warmer than the water in which it floats. But when it reaches the 
Gulf Stream, the water is warmer than the air around the iceberg and 
therefore the under part melts much faster than.the part that extends above 
the surface of the water. This thawing of the under part in time causes the 
iceberg to become top-heavy. Then it will turn over. Sometimes an iceberg 
turns completely over several times during the process of thawing. Icebergs 
have been known to be so tall that when they turned over, they struck the 
ocean floor and were held there for quite a while. This occurs in the shal- 
lower water near the ‘coast. . 
Robert. Icebergs are a great menace to sailors, who are continually on 
the watch for them. There are many ways in which sailors can detect the 
presence of bergs. I am going to tell you some of them. One is that on 
a clear sunny day sailors sometimes see a curious bright flickering light on 
the horizon. They know this is caused by the ice, although they may not 
see the iceberg. It is caused by the reflection from the iceberg. Another 
indication of the nearness of icebergs is the presence of a bank of mist. 
This mist is formed from the warm moist air atove the Gulf Stream coming 
into contact with the iceberg, which condenses it into mist. I am going to 
show you by an experiment how this can happen. The air above this jar 
is warm and moist, like the air above the Gulf Stream. This Mason jar is 
cold, like the icebergs (he empties ice from a Mason jar and holds the cold 
far over the one filled with hot water). The vapor on the inside of this 
jar is formed like the fog that is around the iceberg. 
Mr. M. (holding the jar up so that the audience may see). There is a 
considerable amount of vapor in this jar. 
Oehm. Another way to detect icebergs is by the use of a marine ther- 
mometer. This thermometer works on the principle that copper wire con- 
tracts when cooled. The wires are arranged like this (makes a drawing on 
board), When these two wires contract, they pull a lever, which is con- 
nected with a circuit, This rings a bell up on the ship’s deck or shows 
a red light on the navigation-bridge. I have a little device here that 
works on the same principle as the marine thermometer. I have a copper 
wire running from this part (holding up device constructed from a cigar- 
box, with copper plates and wires) up through a spindle, and it is wound 
around the spindle, so that if the wire contracts, it will touch here and will 
turn the stem and will touch this’ and cause the bell to ring. I am going 
to place this in very cold water. (He does so, and the bell rings.) That
-P-A-G-E-99
98 . Francis W. Parker ScHoon . 
H H Hl 
Y 
  is the way it rings when the wire contracts. Sailors have found this a 
very dependable means of knowing when they are approaching floating ice. 
Margaret. We made this to represent a marine thermometer, like that 
used on ships. This is made on the same principle as the one Oehm de- 
scribed. When a solid is heated, it expands, and when cooled, it contracts. 
So, when this copper wire is put into ice-water, the wire contracts, pulls 
this lever, and that pulls the wire and a bell rings (this device was 
much larger, constructed from a wooden box), This copper wire is drawn 
from this spindle to this other spindle. Then there is another copper wire 
from this spindle, and it connects with a battery. Then there is another 
copper wire from the first spindle to an indicator. There is another wire 
on the back that extends ‘to the battery. When this copper wire contracts, 
it pulls the indicator, which touches this wire and makes the connection, 
thus ringing the bell. 
Dorothy. Sailors on the Atlantic ocean fear icebergs, but those on ‘the 
Pacific ocean do not. The reason for this is that there are few bergs in 
the Pacific ocean, because ‘there is no great land mass extending far north 
where the icebergs can form. There are some glaciers formed in Alaska, 
but when these reach the coast and break off, forming icebergs, they stay 
near the shores until they melt away. There are icebergs in the Arctic 
ocean, but they do not come down into the paths of commerce, because the 
only way they can get into the Pacific ocean is through Bering Strait, and 
as that strait is very. shallow and very narrow, bergs do not pass through 
it. For these reasons, there are no large icebergs in the north Pacific, and 
sailors do not have to be on the look out for them. 
Julia. Even though icebergs are so much feared by the sailors, the
-P-A-G-E-100
Yrar Boor ‘99 
people along the shores of the north country are nevér sorry to ‘see’ them 
come down, as they are very important to the people who live along ‘these 
places. One reason is, that when the people from Labrador and Greenland 
see that the icebergs are coming down, they know that there will be ‘plenty 
of fish. Some kinds of fish prefer very cold water, and ‘as the icébergs 
chill the water for-miles around them, these fish like to swim near’the 
bergs. Then the people get into their: little boats, go out as near to the ice- 
bergs as they can and get the fish. Another use of the icéberg is that: sit 
serves asa means of supplying fresh water. If an iceberg is passing arid 
the sun has melted it, the water collects in little hollows and the fishermen 
can drink it. If there’ is no water on the iceberg, they can break off ‘the 
ice and melt it. Icebergs have sometimes served as means of transportation 
for animals. Dufing the long northern winter, ‘Labrador and Greenland 
are so covered with snow and ice that the animals have a hard time finding 
food. They sometimes venture out on the ice as far as they can go in 
search of food or fish. Sometimes they swim so far that they find the 
passage back too great, and they climb up on icebergs to regain their 
strength. Sometimes polar bears have been carried long distances by 
floating masses of ice. Although they are not native to Iceland, many 
people have seen polar bears there, and it is believed they were carried to 
that region by means of ice. 
V. Modern Ships.—How is a Vessel Propelled by Steam? 
The children bring their toy steam-engines and operate them be- 
fore the class. Diagrams and models of reciprocating-engines are 
used and explained as far as possible by the pupils. 
In order that the pupils may realize the significance of the inven- 
tion of the steam-engine and the effects of its use on the structure and 
carrying power of ships, it is well to study the evolution of the boat 
from primitive types propelled by hand power to modern steam-driven 
craft. In our school this study is made in the woodshop as part of the 
manual-training course.    
STUDY OF THE STEAMBOAT 
In connection with the work in Geography and History for the 
year the handwork of the boys centered about the making of various 
models of historical importance in the evolution of. the steamboat. 
These models furnished considerable material for discussion in science, 
principally physics of an elementary nature. 
Two years previously this same grade had been interested in the 
making of boats and had become familiar with the law of buoyancy, 
which they had proved by means of simple apparatus and tests which 
they themselves had made. A review of this work was therefore in- 
troduced at the beginning of the year’s work.

    MODEL-MAKING IN THE SHOP. 
Why does an object float? This was the question with which the 
discussion opened. This seemingly simple question was quickly dis- 
posed of by the equally simple answer, “because it is lighter than . 
water.” However, objection was quickly made to this answer by one 
of the boys, who cited the case of steel ships, “and steel is heavier than 
water.” The majority of the class seemed to be satisfied with the an- 
swer that it was the air inside which held the boat up. Illustrations 
were given of tin cans and basins floating in water until tipped in such 
a manner that the water entered and displaced the air. To some of 
the class this did not seem to be the true answer and various cases 
were introduced which seemed to disprove this point. Shape had 
something to do with it, according to some of the boys. To develop 
the law of buoyancy the following apparatus was devised and tests were 
made: 
1. Two blocks of wood were made of exactly the same size, one of 
them being of Washington red cedar, which is very light in weight, and the 
other of Georgia pine, which is very heavy and full of pitch. These blocks 
were then gaged with lines.!4 inch apart and then paraffined to make them 
waterproof. 
2. A cardboard box was made by one of the boys, the inside dimen- 
sions being the same as the outside dimensions of the blocks. This was 
+ then marked with lines 4% inch apart and paraffined. 
3. A pan of water big enough to float the blocks of wood was pro- 
duced. 
4. A pair of scales with gram weights was brought from the science 
laboratory. 
The two blocks of wood were floated in the water and the distance ~ 
to which each sank was easily noted by means of the marks gaged on 
the sides. The fact that one block sank deeper in the water and took 
up more room than the other was ‘noted, and led to the term “dis-
-P-A-G-E-102
Year Book ~ 101 
placement.” The question of accurately measuring the amount dis- 
placed by each block was settled by first noting the depth to which 
cach block sank and then pouring enough water into the cardboard box _ 
to reach a similar depth by means of the lines marked on the inside 
which corresponded to the lines marked on the outside of the blocks. 
Now, by weighing the box with the water and deducting the 
weight of the empty box, the weight of the water which was displaced 
by the block was easily determined. Then the block was weighed and 
the results compared. Considering that the apparatus was made by 
the pupils themselves and the actual weighing and measuring was done 
by them, the results as set forth in the following table were quite ac- 
curate enough to prove that the amount of water displaced by the 
floating block of wood, equaled the weight of the block itself.

DISPLACED 
A trip to the Field Museum was made for the purpose of studying 
primitive types of boats, the Pacific Island out-rigger and the Eskimo | 
kayak. Similarity in constructive principles between the kayak and 
the modern boat was noted and the shape as a factor in speed and sea- 
worthiness was discussed. The copying of nature forms, such as the 
duck and the fish, was very evident, and some discussion was had re- 
garding the effect which is produced when a boat is propelled through
-P-A-G-E-103
102 Francis W. Parker ScHoon 
the water and the factors which must be considered, such as displace- 
ment, friction, cleavage of the water (at the bow) and the swirl or 
suction and eddying effect at the stern. 
The next step was to classify boats as to manner of propulsion 
through the water. The following outline was worked out. Con- 
siderable discussion was held as to the exact chronological order of 
development: Rowboats (man power); sailboats (wind power) ; 
steamboats (steam power) ; electric boats. (electric power) ; gasoline 
boats (gas power). 
The length of time which the sailing-vessel had held the center 
of the stage compared to the other types of boats was noted and led to , 
a discussion of the various types of sailing-vessels classified according 
to their rigging, Pictures were brought in by the boys to show the 
various types, and dictionaries, encyclopedias and books of history were 
ransacked to furnish their quotas for this list.

This era in navigation could not be touched upon without refer- 
ence to the various nations famed in history for their discoveries at a . 
time when the art of ship-building was not as highly developed as at 
present. The following list of nations famed for seamanship was de- 
veloped through discussion: Norse, Portuguese, Dutch, Greeks, Vene- 
tians, Genoese, English and New England Colonies. The importance 
of ships in supplying food to the Allies and starving Belgium, as well 
as for supplying our own troops, naturally led to a discussion of the 
great part that the steamship must play in the termination of the war. 
The development of the steam-engine by James Watt, and the at- 
tempt to use the steam-engine for most of the necessary work of the 
world, naturally led the more adventurous inventors to attempt to 
propel boats by means of this new toy developed by the inventive genius 
of man. A study of the early attempts led to some interesting dis- 
coveries. While Robert Fulton’s name was familiar to most of the boys 
as: the inventor of the steamship, a closer study revealed the fact that 
there were others who had struggled with the idea and though reaching
-P-A-G-E-104
Yar Book 103 ~ 
partial success, had failed to arrive at a practical solution. Among 
these were John Fitch and John Stevens and even our own Franklin. 
Thus Fitch and Stevens attempted to make the steam-engine copy the 
exact motions of the hand-propelled oar, which meant the developing 
of a reciprocating motion in the piston-rod. of the engine, which was 
transferred to a circular motion in the main shaft and fly-wheel, and 
then again changed back to a reciprocating motion on the oars. Fulton 
arranged the paddles or oars from the center of the shaft, and the - 
paddle-wheel was developed which was much more efficient. 
During the time devoted to this subject several of the boys 
brought small steam-engines from home, and the whole class was able 
to study at close range the action of the steam-engine and to become 
familiar with the names ofthe essential parts. Diagrams were made 
and terms learned, such as reciprocating, piston, slide-valve, cylinder, 
walking-beam, etc. : 
  PUPILS DIAGRAM OF STEAM ENGINE 
The turbine-engine as the later and more efficient development of 
the steam-engine was studied from pictures and descriptions in books. 
In the shop work the attempt was made to construct some of the 
types of boats studied. Fulton’s Clermont was one which was selected. 
Fitch’s two types, the stern-wheel and a boat propelled by horse-power 
using a treadmill, were fairly successful. The size of the class (19) 
was somewhat of a drawback to the successful completion of many 
models requiring individual attention. 
The benefit obtained from this study, however, was well worth 
the effort spent on it, even though the results. of. the handwork side
-P-A-G-E-105
104 Francis W. Parker ScHoou 
were crude and incomplete. The admiration for the persistence with 
which such a man as John Fitch clung to an idea and sactificed money 
and friends in his effort to reach success, was an important benefit de- 
rived from the study. 
The daring displayed by the early explorers was also marveled at 
when it was realized that these explorers sailed uncharted seas, with 
crude instruments, in vessels so tiny that exact reproductions have 
been picked up with block and tackle and hoisted aboard our modern 
liners and transported across the Atlantic as a bit of baggage. These 
are lessons quite as important to the growing boy in dealing with the 
industries and work of the world as is a technique gained in the use 
of certain tools.

DOMESTIC SCIEN CE: 
In the sixth grade ‘the children all show « ‘keen intérest in: “the 
problems related to the home. This interest, while equally strong: 
both boysiand girls, is centered on quite different problems. For this 
reason the: work is divided during the year, that of the boys: <ééming 
in the fall and that of the girls in the winter and spring. 
The influence of the Boy Scout movement is strong at this age as 
well as the natural-desire to learn how to cook in camp. The work of 
the boys is based entirely on these interests, and each year an excursion 
is planned where a lunch can be cooked out of doors under true camp- 
ing conditions. 
The work of the girls bears directly on the home and takes up, ip 
as broad a sense as possible, the ideals of home-making. Although 
based on different interests, the questions asked by both boys and girls 
involve the same fundamental ideas of economy, sanitation, health, and 
food preparation. 
The need of economy and co-operation on the part of the children 
has been emphasized by the necessities which have come about through 
the war. The problems studied by the boys are as follows: : 
J. Economy.—What foods can best be cooked in camp? With . 
regard to bulk and weight; with regard to cost? How can waste be 
prevented in the camp or in the home? 
Il. Sanitation and Health—What conditions must exist if we 
wish to keep well? Need for cleanliness and order; proper care of 
food and supplies. What food materials are needed for strength and

our homes are to be pleasant and healthful ?

a girl ought to be able to prepare? How can these foods be served so 
as to be attractive and palatable? How can variety be secured?

broader aspects of home-making are introduced whenever possible

THE SEVENTH GRADE 
  
All that follows has doubtless béen said many times, but must 
needs be repeated. Do we wish our students to have a live, active in- 
terest in plant life and its relation to man? How important is that 
interest? Would a more general and intelligent interest in plant life 
make for qualities of character and points of view of which we find 
ourselves in need a& we consider the growing ideals of citizenship? . 
What emphasis should a study of plant life receive in school? To. 
establish a real interest, how early must we begin and how must we. 
proceed? It is a matter of common knowledge and experience that 
the old traditional botany courses, as a method of teaching about plant 
life, fail. Dr. John D. Coulter says, in his preface to Plant Life and 
Plant Uses, “Boys and girls, by mere accumulation of organized 
knowledge about plants, may never come to that appreciation of plants 
as a part of life which is believed to be very desirable.” Though there 
has long existed general agreement concerning these facts, and nature 
study and school gardens have been prescribed and tried as solutions to 
the problem, we still find ourselves wondering why young people, 
though perhaps interested for the time being, and in some cases in- 
dicating more than a passing interest, do not more generally seek 
voluntarily to come in contact with plant life and its study. 
Doubtless much, or most of the time given to so-called nature 
study has been devoted to mere observation, not impelled by curiosity 
or a keen desire to know, but directed by the teacher who was endeavor- 
ing to teach certain facts required in the course of study. The school 
garden remains our chief -source of hope. There it is that the boys 
and girls can, through their own activity, have the joy of touching 
and smelling the earth and of watching the wonder of germination and 
growth. There it is that they can observe living organisms, form and 
color in all their diversity and variety. There it is that their craving 
* for beauty can at least in some small measure be fed. The need for 
expression in drawing and painting, modeling and making, singing 
and dancing, is an accepted theory, well considered and provided for 
in all good teaching. The addition of the art of gardening as a form 
of expression needs yet to be made. 
So far, the school gardens have most generally been used to teach 
agriculture or truck-gardening, with emphasis on economic values, or 
108
-P-A-G-E-110

to teach isolated facts about soils, plants, insects, etc. Surely, the love 
of beauty is instinctive, and this we may not forget when we consider 
the school garden. What other opportunity so wide and adequate offers 
itself. for the teaching of the esthetics which will beautify our city 
windows and gardens, and our farm roadsides and dooryards? It is 
only when interest in and love for plant life is part of our child-life 
that it endures. Man may travel devious paths in search of those in- 
terests which lead to the great vistas and inspirations of life, but. his 
garden is a broad and certain gateway to beauty, ever-widening 
horizons, and finer human relations. a , 
With such an activity to engage one’s efforts, it remains to help 
the boys and girls choose wisely from the numberless problems which 
present themselves with much insistence. The making of the school 
garden is the center for most of the science and geography work of the 
seventh grade. However, before presenting the plan of the year’s 
work, it may be well, in answer to inquiries which are frequently made, 
to insert some general remarks about the garden as a project in this 
school. 
Our membership has grown and our available garden space has 
gradually decreased to make room for other outdoor activities also 
necessary to the life of the school (houses for the museum, the wireless 
club, first-grade playhouse, etc.). These changed conditions could not 
practically and fittingly be met by the use of our old garden plan.* 
The plan used then provided an opportunity to consider each 
child’s choice, so that he might express himself as an individual, 
esthetically, commercially, or scientifically ; it provided space for classes . 
to work as such on a class problem ; it planned, for the sake of appear- 
ance and better product, to have all children making similar choices 
plant in the same sections; it attempted to give each individual all 
necessary assistance. 
Since that time many changes have occurred affecting the garden 
experiences of our children. The use of the old plan meant too many 
children working in too small a space, duties too limited, and inter- 
ference so constant and discouraging as to destroy the respect which 
any good work should receive. The old plan also required, especially 
from grade teachers. a high degree of co-operation, which some- 
times was necessarily artificial or forced.. Since neither the experience 
nor the training of class teachers, except in individual cases, gives them 
a vital interest in plant life, the farm, and the garden, it is a mistake 
“Described in detail in the Elementary School Teacher, Jan., 1906,
-P-A-G-E-111
110 Francis W. Parxrr ScHoon 
to expect them to be of great assistance. Therefore, it has been neces- 
sary gradually to reorganize the work so that a better adjustment 
may be made between what we can hope for from our school garden 
and what we can really get. , 
Is the real function of a school garden different after all from 
that of any other garden? If it does not make its appeal through its 
esthetic, economic, and social values, is it worth having? Is it possible 
to utilize our time and space, however limited or small, so that our 
boys and girls can be led to feel the beauty of the garden, to like plants 
and actively to contribute te the home or the community by planting 
and caring for them? Can they be led to like appropriateness of sur- 
roundings out of doors so that they can diagnose ugliness, prescribe a 
remedy and obtain a fitting and beautiful result? 
A school in the city must take into consideration a very short 
season for gardening in the spring, and a long absence from school 
during the summer months. Frequently the care given the garden in 
the summer is inadequate. A greenhouse for tiding plants over the 
winter is often impossible. For these and other reasons, emphasis on 
garden work should be heavy in the spring. By careful planning, the 
garden can be made especially beautiful in the early spring and again 
in the fall, when the children return to school. Laboratory work, and 
classroom discussion, can be emphasized in the winter quarter to give 
more time for actual gardening in the spring and fall. 
So far the school has provided some outdoor planting experience 
every year for every child through the first seven grades. Thereafter 
it has fostered only special interests by giving plots to older students 
who wish to give their leisure or vacation time to such work. The 
kindergarten and first grade have small plots of their own and grow 
corn, popcorn, pumpkins, etc., to feed to their pets; they also grow a 
few flowers easy of culture. Grades two to seven plant the vegetable 
garden and when called upon help to beautify neglected spots on the 
school grounds. The seventh grade cares for the flower garden and 
the grounds in front of the school building. They prepare and plant 
the hotbeds which supply the school, home gardens, and window-boxes. 
Bulbs for house culture are distributed every fall. The narcissus, 
which can be grown in bowls filled with pebbles or fibre and water, and 
which blooms in four or five weeks, is of course the favorite. This 
fall, the hotbeds were filled with a variety of bulbs; single and double, 
parrot and reflex tulips; hyacinths; jonquils; scillas; snowdrops;
-P-A-G-E-112

daffodils; and Haster lilies, which were brought into the schoolrooms. 
in February, to be forced into bloom for Easter. © : 
About five or six hundred two or ‘three-year-old trees are .dis- 
tributed every spring for Arbor day, at a penny each. These-are all 
planted in home gardens. Though many do not survive, enthusiastic 
reports come in from successful planters. A number of trees are now 
fifteen or more feet high, and their owners, the alumni, report their 
growth with pride. Some special trees, shrubs, or vines, are planted 
every year by the May Queen, as the gift of the Senior class to the 
school. The high-school students and men of the faculty spend a 
‘Saturday in the garden in the spring doing work too heavy or too 
difficult for younger children. They do heavy spading in the vegetable 
garden, haul manure, lay out beds, make paths, mend and paint fences, 
ete. The high-school girls prepare a luncheon and help to make the 
day one of wholesome, purposeful labor and of genuine social worth. 
The year’s work in the seventh grade subdivides itself into the 
following projects: ' 
I. The harvesting and general observation of the fall garden 
lead to the giving of two morning exercises in October. The first is 
organized to make a careful report to the school of the work done in 
the garden by each group and of the outcome of this work as a part of 
the harvest. This exercise is directly followed by another, given by 
the seventh grade, on the year’s world crop.reports. On the same day, - 
the “County Fair” takes place, described in Year Book, Vol. IV, p. 23. 
Ii, Clearing the vegetable and flower gardens for winter and 
for planting of spring garden. 
Ill. Planting of bulbs and perennials and covering for winter 
protection. Planting of bulbs for indoor forcing. 
IV. A review and organization of science experiences of previous 
grades into a more orderly, complete body, using the laboratory to 
answer questions. 
VV. Close observation and care of spring garden, and planting 
of summer and fall gardens. 
I. The Year's Crops—Consideration of our garden crop natur- 
ally brings to mind such questions as, How much food do I eat in a 
day? Inaweek? Inayear? Can I picture concretely that amount? 
In what proportion do the great staple products appear? How much 
food does my home use in a year? Our city? Is it possible to think,
-P-A-G-E-113
112. Francis W. Parker ScHoou 
in terms of bulk or measure of any kind, how much food the world 
needs? Who does all this work of production? Where are the great ” 
important staple crops produced, and why? 
The study of the contribution of the various countries to the 
world’s food supply opens the field of problems involving the inter- 
relation of food production and climatic conditions. Definite ques- 
tions concerning air.and water relations are brought up, which are 
answered in subsequent laboratory and classroom work. Geography 
also has a real significance here. The study of this. question includes 
practically a review of the geography of the world. Climatic relations 
are constantly in evidence and numerous facts are mentioned as such * 
without discussion of causes and relationships; for example, barley and 
rye appear in the list of certain products of Russia and Germany. The 
reasons for this are mentioned but not fully discussed in this prelimi- 
nary work. ‘The exact reasons are more fully set forth in the detailed 
study of climate, air, water, and soil made in the laboratory during 
the winter quarter. Mathematical geography and the history of the 
development of geographic knowledge are topics studied in this con- 
nection. 
II. Fall Gardening.—The garden must be cleared before an 
early frost comes, so that our planting may be done. What shall we 
do first? If we clear it before the frost shows us what will be killed, 
how can we know what to pull up and what to leave? Why do some 
plants die and others live through the long, hard winter? What are 
annuals, biennials, perennials? Are some plants annuals in some lati- 
tudes. and perennials in others? Do some plants naturally require 
more time to grow up, to mature, just like some animals? Why? 
Does this difference in time show itself in the results accomplished by 
the plants? What are herbaceous plants? ‘ 
Shall the dead annuals be saved for covering or not? Would it 
be better to burn them for fertilizer? If they are scattered about do 
the seeds sometimes self-sow? Are some plants troublesome in this 
way? To clean the fences, we must pull off the annual vines. How can 
we ‘tell them from the perennial climbers? How many of each do 
we have on the school grounds? What does a plant gain by being a 
climber? Shall the soil be spaded or not? Shall fertilizer be added? 
What is the best fertilizer for bulbs? For perennials ? 
Our school closes about the middle of June. What plants, that 
will surely blossom before school closes, shall we choose to make our 
garden beautiful for spring?
-P-A-G-E-114
Yar Boox 113 
III. Fall Outdoor and Indoor Planting.—What bulbs and plants 
that blossom in the spring are planted in the fall? What is a bulb? 
What work does it do? - Does it do more than store food for the coming 
season? Does it form its flower before the winter comes, or in the 
spring? Can we, with the use of the magnifying-glass, see the flower 
in the bulb when it is cut open? If it doesn’t form its flower by fall, 
can it blossom in the spring? Why can we not use forced bulbs the 
second season? Why can some bulbs be forced in water in a few weeks 
and why do others need to be stored in a cold, dark place for several 
months before forcing? How much work can bulbs do under the snow 
and ice in winter? The root growth made in winter out.of doors is 
always a great surprise, and so also is-the rapid growth of leaves and 
blossoms made after bringing the bulb into the heated room. 
These observations lead to such questions as: Why do we have 
finer wild flowers some years than others? Does nature always. suc- 
cessfully provide plants with protection against sudden changes in 
temperature or other irregularities in the weather? If not, what hap- 
pens? Are there evidences of such histories to be seen in the woods? 
Are some annuals or perennials good for house forcing? What kinds? 
Do we ever force bulbs or plants which naturally bloom late in 
summer ? : oe 
There are always questions which lead to the idea of the chemistry 
of growth. These are given such attention as may encourage further 
observation and which will clearly indicate the relation of chemistry 
to growth. . , 
Can we tell by looking at a plant or bulb how it should be trans- 
planted? Are there signs or marks of any kind to show how they were 
planted before? Has the size of the bulb anything to do with the depth 
of planting? What happens when. the bulb is planted too deep? What 
happens when it is planted too near the surface? A few bulbs in the 
garden were found on top of the ground when the snow disappeared. 
How did they get there? What pushed them out? What can be done 
to aid a plant or bulb newly set out? What might hinder its growth 
_or kill it? What bulbs or plants can live through the winter without 
covering? With covering? Not at all? What makes good covering? 
Some time is spent on the study of plants, their history, the bulb 
industry and its place and magnitude in the work of the world. 
IV. Review and Organization of Science Experience With Lab- 
oratory Work.—The urgent questions arising from the garden proj- 
ect, together with a growing desire of the children to relate their vari-
-P-A-G-E-115
114 Francis W. Parker ScHooL 
ous science experiences, require a simple organization of earlier work, 
and the addition of such experience and subject. matter as a more ad- 
vanced attitude requires. This organization serves to widen their 
mental horizon and at the same time reveals new relationships. 
he children have had some first-hand contact with land forms, 
plant life, animal life, agriculture, horticulture, meteorology, as- 
tronomy, geography, physics, chemistry, and methematics in their ex- 
cursions, travels, and activities in and out of school. But the actual 
handling of laboratory apparatus, to ascertain facts and the reasons 
for them, has not been very extensive. It is therefore important that 
the children should become better acquainted with the experimental 
method. The pertinent questions arising from the grade project offer 
excellent opportunities for this kind of study. : 
The laboratory work is organized on the basis of the four great 
divisions: atmosphere, water, life, soil. These are of course all inter- 
related and are not taken up as units or in any formal order. 
It is not the purpose of this report to describe all the experiments 
given in the laboratory, but only to state enough of them to show that 
by means of experiments the children can solve many of the problems 
which confront them. : 
(a) Tur ArmospHERE.—The general topic of the atmosphere and 
the need of experiments in this field may be introduced by means of 
such questions as these: Do our senses always tell us the truth? 
Since we cannot see the atmosphere, does that prove there is none? 
How can we prove there is an atmosphere? The discussion leads the 
child to the conclusion that the only way to find out is by means of 
experiment, and that the atmosphere is a fertile field for experimen- 
tation. The questions raised by the children offer many suggestions as 
to procedure. Of these, the following are typical: 
What is the atmosphere, and how do we know there is an atmo- 
-sphere ? 
Experiment—Show with a vacuum-pump what happens when air is ex- 
hausted from a square gallon can.* 
Experiment-—Set up a mercury barometer. Weigh the column of mer- 
cury from the barometer. Measure the area of the end of the barometer- 
tube, and: compute the weight of the column of mercury in a tube with an 
end area of one square inch. Find the pressure of the atmosphere as deter- 
mined by. the average results of the experiment. 
*If no. vacuum-pump. is available, pour a small amount of water in’ the can and boil: for a few moments. until the steam has displaced the air. Then place an air-tight 
ex, in. the gan, As the steam: cond rtial i ! wep sec: mdenses a partial vacuum is formed and the can

Let each child keep. the barometric readings and weather conditions for 
a period of time and plot a curve. Note conditions of weather on all points 
on the curve. Can any deduction be made as to the kind of weather which 
accompanies high and low barometer? In this connection weather-maps are 
studied. 
Of what does the air consist? Is there much oxygen in the air? 
Experiment—The teacher may demonstrate the approximate amount of 
oxygen in the air. Invert a cylindrical jar' over a piece of wood which is 
floating in water. Place a length of magnesium ribbon on the wood and 
ignite. Does the amount of air in the jar become smaller? What is. the 
approximate amount of oxygen in the air. 
Is the air all oxygen? The other constituents of air are men- 
tioned. 
How pure is the air, and what are some of the impurities 
present ? 
Experiment.—The teacher may show that the air is impure by drawing 
a stream of air through a funnel, over which there is stretched a cloth gauze- 
and a layer of wet filter-paper. Which is more free from dust, city or 
country air? How does the lake breeze improve Chicago’s air? 
In addition to the above properties of air, the following questions 
may be studied in like manner and a broader application made: Why 
does hot air rise? What causes winds? What are cyclones and tor- 
nadoes? What work does the wind do? A discussion of the latter 
question involves a trip to the sand-dunes and the lake shore. 
(b) Warer.—The subject of water is naturally introduced 
through the- garden project. The amount of water in the ground 
under varying conditions of temperature, soil porosity, and dryness of 
the atmosphere offers many interesting problems. The subject may 
be introduced by having the pupils recall the three forms of water. 
Such questions as these are asked: What is the difference between 
boiling and evaporation? Between water-vapor and steam? Why 
does the amount of water-vapor in the air vary? What effect has this 
upon evaporation ? 
These questions, together with those dealing with distillation and 
condensation, lead to a discussion of a number of problems such as: 
Why is rain fall heavier in certain places than in others, and why is 
the ocean salty? What becomes of rain-water? 
Experiment—Let each child pour water on a box of clay and observe 
that some runs off as surface water, some becomes ground water, while some 
is evaporated. With silver nitrate test for hardness the water which seeps 
through.

116 Franots W. Parker ScHoou 
Which kind of water accomplishes the most mechanical work? 
To answer this question, use is made of the sand-table or a stream out 
of doors. Discussion of work of running water naturally follows and 
the reason why river valleys and deltas are fertile is brought out. 
Other points to study about water are: Its chemical composi- 
tion; how the small capillary tubes in the soil make it possible for.a 
plant to get water; atmospheric water, clouds, dew and snow. 
(c) L1re.—In the garden the children.come in contact with vari- 
ous aspects of plant and animal life, and begin to realize the wonder- 
ful adaptation of this life to its environment. The natural desire on 
the part of the children to know something about the life of the past 
and the change from past life forms to present ones, is the reason for 
making a brief study of prehistoric life. In this study the effect of 
changing environment upon life forms is emphasized. 
The purpose of this historical study is fourfold: First, to satisfy 
a curiosity about prehistoric life; second, to make museum specimens 
intelligible; third, to show development of life and the dependence of 
life upon environment; fourth, to furnish a background for the work 
in the eighth grade. 
For these reasons an outline of the five eras of earth history, and 
’ the periods of the last three eras are given. Since the names are diffi- 
cult, the derivation and meaning of each are explained. 
1, Azoic (without life)—We speak of the azoic as a very long era, 
in which vulcanism was probably the dominant feature. We learn to recog- 
nize the most common igneous rocks; such as lava, obsidian, granite, pumice, 
and ash. 
2. Archeozoic (dawn of life)—-This era is spoken of as one of very 
long duration. Running water, the wind, and the other agencies were at 
work. The era stands out. as one of the great folding and faulting, also 
as a period of some vulcanism. We learn to recognize specimens of gneiss, 
schist, slate, quartzite, shale, sandstdne, limestone, and conglomerate. Under 
what conditions is each formed? What is a sedimentary rock? What is 
a metamorphic rock? What evidence of life is there in the archeozoic era? 
3. Paleozoic (very old life)—Under the paleozoic seven divisions are 
mentioned: Cambrian—named after an outcrop in Cambria, England; Ordi- 
‘vician, named after ancient tribe of Ordivicii in Wales; Silurian, named 
after ancient tribe Silurii, in Wales; Devonian, named after outcrop in 
Devonshire, England; Mississippian, conspicuous system of rocks in the 
Mississippi Valley; Pennsylvanian, the conspicuous system or rocks in Penn- 
sylvania; Permian, named from outcrop in Permia, Russia. 
4. Mesozoic (middle life).—Three divisions are given: Triassic, named 
from the three formations which occur in Germany; Jurassic, from the out-
-P-A-G-E-118
Yzar Book 117 
  crops in the Jura mountains; Cretaceous, from the chalk formation in Eng- 
land and Germany. 
This era is remembered as the era of saurians, or reptiles. We visit 
the Academy of Sciences and the Field Museum to see the skeletons and 
pictured restoration of the reptiles. On our book-shelves we keep many 
standard references and publications of various museums. From our ex- 
      DRAWINGS OF EXTINCT ANIMALS FOR MORNING EXERCISE
-P-A-G-E-119
118 Franois W. Parxrr ScHoon 
  DRAWINGS OF EXTINCT ANIMALS FOR MORNING EXERCISE 
cursions and references we learn something about the conditions in which 
the fossils are found and the probable conditions which caused the animals 
to be entombed and become fossilized. We review certain facts which lead
-P-A-G-E-120
Yuar Book 119 
men to believe that they know something about the landscape of prehistoric 
times. The entire study ds for the most part descriptive. 
To make clear ‘the purpose -of naming the periods under each ‘era, ‘it may 
be well to give an illustration. A certain fossil in the museum is labelled, 
Dinosaur—Triassic—Jurassic. The child at once tabulates the animal as 
having lived in the mesozoic era, which is late in the world’s history, rather 
than that it is just “prehistoric.” 
5. Cenozoic (recent life) —The divisions mentioned are: Eocene, Mio- 
cene, Pliocene, and Pleistocene. We speak of this as the era of mammals. 
In ‘this connection we trace the development of the horse, as shown ‘by 
fossils. We also note the apparent evolution of birds from reptiles. Em- 
phasis is placed on evolution and its connection with climate and physio- 
graphic conditions. 
This life-study culminates in a morning exercise on prehistoric 
life, or in a lecture by an authority on paleontology. 
In this study we make use of the information we gained when 
studying running water. We note how earth materials carried by the 
streams to lakes, oceans, and lowlands can there be deposited as sedi- 
ment; how this may be reworked by waves and winds, and then laid 
down in beds; how animals’ remains may be imbedded in these sedi- 
ments, later to be fossilized ; how beds of Cambrian rocks may lie upon 
Archean and all the others above in order, or how they may easily be 
formed out of their regular order in the column; how horizontal beds 
may be formed on upturned beds; what the coal -measures mean, how 
they may get out of the horizontal position, and what they tell us about 
prehistoric climate. 
These questions make necessary a brief study of folding and 
faulting as probably caused by shrinkage or tension of the earth’s 
crust. 
We begin a brief examination of the United States Geological 
Survey folios, choosing those which are typical of the different regions 
in the United States. The childten observe that the beds are practic- 
ally undisturbed in some regions and very much disturbed in others. 
A report of each region 'is made to the class by pupils who have -been 
in those regions. For example a child who had visited in Texas re- 
ported the principal facts as she found them in the Uvalde Folio, 
Texas. 
The children are encouraged to study the folios of the regions 
where they plan to spend their summer vacations. A number of in- 
quiries have been made as to whether folios of the regions to which 
they are going are ‘available.

(d) Sor.—The garden project furnishes the next important 
subject for investigation. Of the problems studied in this connection, 
the following are those which are solved by means of experiments in 
and out of doors. Of what does soil consist? To answer this, we take 
samples of soils from the different areas in the vicinity of Chicago and 
examine them under the microscope. We note that soil is made up of 
a greater or smaller amount of inorganic material, dependent upon the 
source of that soil, For salt content we test one of the soils, prefer- 
ably one of clay, by means of. silver nitrate, as in our water experi- 
ment. : 
How is soil formed? We go to the lake shore and see soil being 
made mechanically, and then we go to our garden and see the vegetable 
matter decaying, and note that soil may be made by the process of 
chemical action. 
What makes the soil black? In answer to this, we pour a small 
amount of sulphuric acid on vegetable matter of different kinds. We 
note that they all turn black. .We explain that the sulphuric acid pro- 
duces a very rapid decomposition, and that the resulting product is 
similar to that of the slower decay. 
Does soil hold water? What does ‘porosity of soil mean? Is a 
soil which is very porous a good soil? If so, under what conditions? 
What is a thin soil? How can a thin soil be improved? What is a 
subsoil? How can soil be made to retain water? Is a fertile soil with- 
out water-holding power practical for cultivation? What becomes of a 
soluble fertilizer which is used on a very porous subsoil ? 
What is a hotbed? What makes it hot? Does the decomposition 
of organic matter affect the temperature of soil? Does it make any 
difference whether or not the decomposition of the organic matter is 
just started or is complete? What kind ot manure is required for a 
hotbed ? 
Do all plants need the same kind of soil? What is an inorganic - 
fertilizer? What is bone-meal? Lime? What is the purpose of each 
as a fertilizer? What is the value in deep plowing? Is it a good thing 
to plow under the last year’s growth of weeds, cornstalks or wheat 
straw? What is dry farming? Why. should the soil be cultivated? 
When should one cultivate deeply and when shallowly? Under what © 
conditions is rolling a good thing? 
These problems are merely suggestive of some of those which come 
up in connection with the study of soil. The application of the infor- 
mation gained is made in the garden. :

up through the scarcely thawed ground. The garden early becomes. a 
beauty spot with its dainty crocuses, scillas, narcissi, daffodils, and 
jonquils. These give place to the gay tulips, bleeding-hearts, iris of 
many hues, peonies and other perennials which gladden the eye in the 
later spring days. 
By the end of May the spring garden is passed. The bulbs must 
be carefully dug up, spread in the sun to dry, labeled, and put away 
for the summer, to be planted again the next fall. 
Then come the spading and weeding of the beds preparatory to 
transplanting from the hotbeds and sowing in the open ground the

seeds of those plants which will blossom during the late summer and 
make the garden a profusion of flowers in the fall when the children 
return to school. 
The children transplant from the hotbeds into the garden-beds, 
zinnias, petunias, scabiosa, asters, cosmos, marigolds, snapdragon, 
celosias, salvia, nasturtiums, bachelor buttons, poppies, and other late 
flowering plants, and border the beds with sweet alyssum, ageratum, 
dwarf nasturtium, etc. By the fences they plant moonflower, morning 
glories, Australian pea-vines, scarlet runner, and other trailing vines. 
The tender transplanted plants need careful daily watering until 
they are rooted. The beds must be weeded and all be in good order by 
the closing day of school. Through the summer months a few of the 
children who live in the neighborhood come occasionally to weed. The 
bulk of the summer work must, however, be left to the janitors.

So, by means of careful selection and planting, and good grow- 
ing weather, one can have in the school garden a succession of beautiful 
flowers, from the early snowdrops and crocuses which come with the 
melting of the snow to the late flowering cosmos, hardy chrysanthe- 
mums, asters and zinnias, which brave the first frosts and earliest fy- 
ing snows of autumn.

THE EIGHTH GRADE 
  
In these days of blood and iron, the man who talks of matters he 
knows nothing of is doubly intolerable. One listens eagerly to the 
laundress’ mother, who was a peasant on one of the Kaiser’s estates 
and knows well the service America has done for the immigrant from 
Germany ; but one turns with weariness and disgust from the second- 
hand opinions of one’s acquaintance and one’s newspaper about the 
conduct of the war, the diplomacy of our Department of State, or the 
future of Russia: If one were but privileged to be as rude as. he 
feels, what a deal of weariness he might avoid in ordinary conver- 
sation. Instead of permitting the chance-met acquaintance to emulate 
the loungers in the village post-office, settling the affairs of the world 
while they wait for the late train, one could say, “What do you read?” 
“I read,” says he, “The Chicago Tribune, The New Republic, The 
Literary Digest, The Public, and The Atlantic Monthly.’ “Very 
well, then I know what you think. Is there any subject that you 
really know something about from first-hand experience? If you 
must talk, talk about that.” 
To afford opportunity for first-hand experience, to make plain 
how essential it is to observe and handle material, if one is to draw 
conclusions on material matters, is the function of the teaching of 
science from the teacher’s point of view. There is no contention here 
that first-hand opinions in the realms of taste and of intellect are or 
are not superior in value; the writer wishes to submit that in any 
realm there is a difference in quality between the knowledge gained 
by one’s own deduction and the knowledge gained by assent to author- 
ity. I believe that giving children much of this kind of opportunity 
makes citizens fit for democracy and capable of understanding and 
supporting it; while long training of the other sort makes a servile 
people, fit only to step into the gutter when authority in uniform 
clanks by. The teacher’s endeavor, when choosing science work for 
the grade, should therefore be to present actual material and train 
children to draw independent conclusions. 
The outline of the eighth-grade science work will show what 
material we present to the children. This material, we believe, has 
significance at their stage of development, and will, we hope, set their 
. 125 '

126 Francois W. Parker ScHoon 
minds actively to work. Most important, from our point of view, is 
the landscape of the Chicago area. In a former number of the Year 
Book, I have written at some length on the attitude of mind which 
physiography teachers believe develops from rich experience in read- 
ing landscape. (Year Book, Vol. IV., p. 56.) I need not repeat these 
opinions. Science teachers are agreed upon them. But J should like 
to speak of three factors which greatly aid the teacher in the science 
work in this grade. First of these is the merital attitude of the chil- 
dren. The outlines of the lower grades show that our children come 
to the eighth grade with a store of invaluable outdoor experience. 
They evince a gratifying bent for finding out reasons for themselves, 
calculated to make the teaching of physiography in this grade seem 
more like pointing them the way where, by due effort, they may ap- 
pease their appetites, than like setting them an ungrateful task. To 
the class the work, beginning as it does with the making of a topo- 
-graphic map in the field and the reading and interpretation of topo- 
graphic maps in preparation for field excursions, seems entirely new. 
But from every pupil entering our eighth grade from other schools, 
we have the wondering complaint that the others do this work better, 
because the complainant has “never had it before.” What he sees 
his classmates in possession of is not knowledge of the topographic 
map, but a mental attitude. Their experience throughout their school 
life, in handling actual material, manifests itself in their eager relish 
of a novel task, before which the new pupil is more or less aghast. 
John’s letter, a part of which follows, I insert, because it typifies 
this joy in working out a thing for oneself, which we believe we see 
in the children as & result of this year’s science work. The letter 
was written two years after John felt the grade, after a summer 
spent in Massachusetts. .

“I certainly appreciate your’ work in geology, physiography, etc. It 
enabled me to skip the physiography coursé at Lane, and has made every 
rock, ridge, or pond more interesting. This week I have been reading 
‘The Geology of Essex County,’ by John Sears, of the Peabody Museum. As 
the book says, it ‘covers every one-sixth of a square mile, first east to west, 
then west to east, north to south, south to north, northwest to southeast, * 
etc, in great detail, With the book, and a large topographic map, with the 
rocks at surface colored, together with auto rides through the county, I 
got a pretty good idea of things, although I did get tangled up where 
the quartz-hornblende-diorite was cutting dikes in the hornblende-epidote- 
gneiss. From what I could make out, the county has first the pré-Cambrian
-P-A-G-E-128

sedimentary rocks, which were bumped up into mountains two miles high 
by the intruding lava; that this lava was cut by more lava; that there were 
mountains cut by dikes, dikes by veins; that there was layer after layer of 
volcanic rock; that the land sank, the. ocean covered it and formed thin 
sediments; that beaches were formed, now high and dry miles in- 
land; then the land rose and the glacier came down from the north; 
scratches, drumlins, eskers, kames, were formed; and now the land is 
sinking. Trees may be seen far under water, and islands are smaller every 
day (more or less), The rivers are all drowned valleys, up which the tide 
runs. The book was a good deal too deep for me, but by reading 75% I 
understood 15% and will remember 5%. I wish I could find a book like 
that about every region I visit.” ; 
* * * 
“Finding a book like that about every region one visits” is un- 
fortunately not possible. But John’s letter makes one hope that the 
year’s work results in a belief in a changing landscape; an under- 
standing of how land surfaces, by their materials, show their his- 
tory, sea-bottom origin, emergence, submergence, etc.; and a power 
of first-hand observation and deduction. If it does so result, find- 
ing books is a secondary matter. 
Some books, however, are- needed through the year, and the 
second of the special aids to the teacher of eighth-grade science is 
the form of textbook we are working out. Of course, our primary 
text is the natural landscape. But during the winter this book is 
closed. A formal textbook is calculated to defeat the very purpose 
of the study, to substitute authority for original deduction. One 
wants to give the child the answer when he is eager with the ques- 
tion. The textbook answers questions before they are asked. The 
good teacher, of course, can conquer any difficulty, but the difficulty 
inherent in the use of a physiography textbook is so great that the 
writer has for some years tried to conquer it by avoiding it, by using 
no textbook whatever. The evil consequent upon this heroic remedy 
is obvious. The.pupil has not material for reference and review such 
as he likes-to have. Supplementary reading of great value is afforded 
by the Illinois State Geological Survey, especially Bulletins 7 and 11. 
We study about a hundred pages of these books with much profit. 
They can be used by a pupil to test the correctness of his conclusions, 
and are in so far good. But we are compiling a loose-leaf textbook, 
still far from complete, which will, we believe, have all the virtues 
and none of the vices of the regular texthook. Most of our lessons are 
reprints from the government survey papers, on representative areas.
-P-A-G-E-129
128 Francis W. Parker ScHoou 
When pupils have studied the topographic map of Donaldsonville, 
Mississippi, and have drawn a profile, and most of them are clear in 
their own minds that a river of this type flowing above the surround- 
ing land is impossible, and that the government surveyors are having 
a joke at their expense, a lesson on the natural levees of the lower 
Mississippi is seized upon with avidity. The like is true after a 
study of the drumlins of Sun Prairie, or other interesting areas. 
Other sheets are mineralogy tables, or review lessons on the origin 
of common rocks. The sheets fit the children’s portfolios, and are 
interspersed with their own maps, papers, and diagrams. 
Mention of the children’s portfolios recalls the third factor in 
making this teaching most agreeable to the teacher. It is the custom 
in our school for every child to keep all of his papers for the year in 
portfolios. It is also the custom for the teacher, each year, to make 
a portfolio of representative papers from each child. These papers 
are primarily for a record of-the child’s work, but they serve also as 
an inspiring source of information and interest for later classes. 
More than one pupil, trying to work out the meaning of the columnar 
section of Chicago, has been assisted by Marcel’s explanation of the 
underlying works which he entitled Story of the Underworld. Ted 
‘left us some highly colored diagrams of an imaginary region in which 
every kind of rock appears, including a fabulously rich gold mine, 
occupying the lava-filled gravel-bed of an ancient river. He wrote a 
clear account of how all these phenomena came about, which has con- 
tributed materially to some boys’ growing conception of Nature’s slow, 
irresistible, impressive forces. Every paper contributed to the teach- 
er’s portfolio may be needed by some later class and merits propor- 
. tionately earnest effort. 
"Besides these papers, we have such things as a series of large 
drawings of faults, copied from various government folios, and other 
diagrams. Last year’s class made us a plaster model of Niagara Falls. 
The horizontal scale is about an inch to the mile, and the vertical 
scale about 10 times as great. When it was first brought upstairs this 
year, the class gathered close around it before school and plied the 
teacher with questions. They read the printed sheets about the region 
with the greatest eagerness, walking up constantly to the model to 
clarify some point about the glacier-filled course at St. David’s, the 
old lake-bottom below Lewiston, Goat Island, the Gorge. Then they 
attempted to make a topographical map from the model. They had
-P-A-G-E-130
Year Book , 129 
already, at the very beginning of the year,.surveyed a hill in Lincoln 
Park, and made a topographic map of it. They had used govern- 
ment contour-maps occasionally, drawing cross-sections, and inter- 
preting the symbols; but the baffling difficulty of this task of making 
such a map from the Niagara model was illuminating to the teacher, 
who had thought that that part of the subject had been thoroughly 
taught. If the cast had rendered no other service than tq show the 
teacher how she had overestimated her success in a piece of teaching, 
it would have been worth the labor spent upon it. 
We found this model very useful also when we were trying to 
work out the topography of the Western Front. This study was based 
on Prof. Douglas Johnson’s most interesting book, Topography and 
Strategy of the Great War. We made a large copy of his map of the 
Paris basin, and as soon as the class saw “the naturaldefences of 
Paris” and realized the topographical reasons for Germany’s advance 
through the flat country of Belgium and France, they worked with 
keen intelligence upon a possible explanation of these five escarpments 
and the water-gaps through which all traffic to Paris must pass. The 
-most difficult part of the reasoning in regard to a rising area of 
tipped strata comes, as physiography teachers know, when the pupil 
has to image the static condition of the upper course of a river dur- 
ing the period when the river is slowly sawing its way through a band 
of hard rock. The children’s eagerness to understand anything con- 
nected with the war helped them over this difficulty, but they were 
also materially helped by study on the Niagara model of the area 
above the falls. Plainly, this part of the river is temporarily at base 
level. The class gave a morning exercise on the Topography of the 
Western Front, a stenographic report of which I insert here:

Alexis. Not only are we, and the peoples of twenty-three other nations 
doing all that is within our power to help the great ideal of democracy, but 
the sea, a million years ago, when it lapped its distant shores, rocking over 
what is today Francé, was bending its mighty power towards helping democ- 
racy. The enormous pressure that folded and contorted the rock, the 
majestic rivers that carved the land, all had their share in the great battle 
between autocracy and democracy. The reasons-for this are to be told in 
what follows. Had it not been for the great resistance given by the 
Belgians at Liége, and the way in which the rocks lie in Northern France, 
the Germans would probably be in possession today of entire Europe.

You are now asked to come to a meeting of French generals, who will 
consult each other as to which way the enemy will be most likely to make 
its attack. 
(Group of boys enter and seat themselves about a table, with a teleg- 
rapher at a desk near-by.) 
First General (Charles). We are on the verge of war, and we have 
come to discuss how the enemy can get into Paris—how they will first 
advance on Paris. What is your view, general? 
Second General (Preston). 1 think that a very probable way for the 
Germans to attack Paris would be through the second escarpment at Toul.. 
They would do this, because their object is to take Paris as quickly as 
possible, before any other country can come to the aid of France. In 
order to do this, they will, of course, take the shortest route to Paris, 
which is through Toul, the distance being only 170 miles from there to 
Paris. Besides being the shortest route to Paris, Toul is also a very 
important railroad center, and it would be very easy to transport troops 
through Toul’ by the railways. Since the Franco-Prussian war, Germany 
has owned the city of Metz, and if she can capture the city of Nancy 
she will have two direct lines of march through Toul, so I do not believe 
the Germans would have a very hard time getting to Paris by this route. 
Third General (Carter). As you say, it is only 170 miles to Paris from 
Metz. But even so, I do not think that the Germans would take this route. 
The reason for my saying this is that the fortifications around Nancy 
are very strong; it would mean a great loss of life if they should try to 
storm these fortifications, But instead, I think they would come up the 
Meuse river and attack Namur, and from there proceed up the river, even 
though the country is rough and difficult. When they come to Toul, they 
would have to come through Nancy, and the plan I am expecting would 
save them taking these two escarpments and they would be much nearer 
Paris. From the river Meuse they would then proceed to Paris by cap- 
turing Verdun, 
Fourth General (Walter). I do not agree with you in this, General, In 
coming up the Meuse, the Germans would be going through Belgian ter- 
ritory. Therefore, if they are going to violate Belgium, instead of going 
by way of the steep escarpments, which are hard to ascend and very 
strongly fortified, they will cut across the southern end of Belgium, going 
around the northern end of the escarpments, which will bring them down 
in front of Paris. They will in this way go up the Meuse river only as 
far as Namur; they will plan to cut off the French army by surrounding 
it on all sides. In the meantime, they will try to send another army up 
through the northern part of Belgium and France and capture the seaports. 
This would not only enable them to have a good range on England, but 
also to keep other armies and supplies from coming by sea to help France 
or Belgium. After the French army is surrounded, it would be an easy 
task to capture Paris, so I think such places as Namur and Liége should 
be most carefully watched and the Belgians reinforced strongly if necessary. 
First General (Charles). It is altogether improbable that they would do 
this, because I do not think there is a nation so low that it would risk its
-P-A-G-E-132
Yar Book 131 
standing in the world for a small military advantage. If they did go 
through Belgium, that would bring England into the war, and perhaps even 
America. And as for having them go through Belgium to the coast, it is 
impossible, as it is marshy and swampy in that region and heavy guns 
could not go through. Another reason is that a small army in Belgium 
could. hold Germany for at least three days, so that England could get 
her forces together and stop thé drive. But just the same, I would advise 
having strong forces at Nancy, Verdun, Liége, and Toul, 
(The instrument on the desk ticks a message, and the operator hands 
a telegram to the general.) 
General. Gentlemen: Germany has thrown away her honor and has 
declared war. They are coming through Belgium and are storming Liége. 
(Exit generals to the defence of France.) 
(Group of children on stage answering questions put by Edward.) 
Edward. We are all interested, since the United States declared war 
on Germany, in the army and navy, perhaps more interested in the army 
and navy than in anything else. We are going to try to show you by 
twelve questions what the officers have to learn before they go over to 
France of the topography of the Paris basin, and we are going to show 
you how we think the Paris basin was formed. I will put the questions. 
You are to suppose that the pupils answering them: are men in the Officers’ 
Training camp. ° 
First Question.—Imagine a rock surface covered through long ages by 
a shallow sea. Imagine changes in the temperature, depth, stillness of the 
water, and character of the incoming rivers, 
William. Sedimentary rock would be formed, and the change of tem- 
perature would prevent or make coral. A rushing river coming into the 
sea would make conglomerate; the slower rivers coming in would make 
sandstone; and the very slow rivers: coming into a shallow sea will bring 
down clay and lay it in the sea bottom, and make shale. 
Second Question—Imagine earth shrinkage, causing violent faulting and 
contortion of the rock, and imagine emergence of the rock in the east and 
gentle bowing to the west. 
John. In case of rock contortion and gentle bowing in the west, a 
portion of the rock will project above the surface of the sea, and the 
softer rocks will be washed away by the rain water. 
Third Question—Imagine recession of the sea from the entire area. 
What would be the first cause of change? 
Ruth, After the sea recedes, the rivers will be the first cause of change. 
Fourth Question—How tong will these rivers work? 
Barbara, The rivers will work until they cut down to the base-level. 
Fifth Question—What will be the character of the rivers at the close of 
this period? 
Ruth. At the close of this period the rivers will be old; they «will 
be slow and meandering. 
Sixth Question—Imagine a slow uplifting of the entire area. What will 
happen at the mouths of the rivers? 
John, At the mouths of the rivers falls will be formed.
-P-A-G-E-133
132 Francis W. Parker Scuoon 
Seventh Question-Where will the rapid cutting be checked, and for 
how long? 
Margaretta. The rapid cutting will be checked when the falls reach a 
hard layer of rock, and then a slow cutting will continue until the falls have 
again reached a softer layer of rock when the cutting will be much swifter. 
Eighth Question What will happen, meanwhile, below this point? 
Ruth. Below this point, the rivers and their tributaries will have been 
cutting the surface down to the base-level. 
Ninth Question.—What will be happening above this point? 
Barbara. Nothing will be happening above this point, because the cut- 
ting is checked, and the rivers can only meander in their beds. 
Tenth Question-——What will happen above the hard rock as soon as the 
river has sawed through and made a gap? 
John. As soon as the river cuts a narrow gorge through the hard rock 
and hits the soft rock, it will cut much faster. It will meander around in 
this soft rock and tributaries will form and will cut away all the soft rock, 
until it has the same level as the river-bed as it cuts through the hard rock. © 
In other words, it will hollow the entire area of soft rock out, leaving the 
hard rock as a great plateau. Then it will cut through the next layer of 
hard rock and repeat the action, That is, it will make a cliff, or escarpment. 
Edward, This is what we meant when we said, “A million years ago 
the sea was working for the ideal of democracy.” Thése escarpments 
have played a great part in checking some of the great German drives. 
“At Verdun the escarpment near there probably did as much as the French 
army to stop the German drive. The topography of the land around Verdun 
will be explained a little later. 
Elizabeth. The western front today starts in the northern part of 
Belgium, at Ypres, and goes straight south at the east of Lille, and then 
straight on down west of Amiens. Then it goes straight east to Verdun. 
It has been very hard for the German troops to take these escarpments, 
because the English artillery can mow them down before they can make 
any headway. They were able to get Lille because the hills were not so 
steep up there and they got up the escarpment before they were beaten 
back. . 
Caroline. One of the largest battles of the war was Verdun, and 
happened in 1916, The country around Verdun is a network of hills and 
valleys, very similar to the north shore of the Chicago area except on a large 
scale. 
“The Germans attacked three different times. First over the escarpment 
on the west of the Moevre. This attack was a failure, because the French 
had felt that it was necessary to command the hills surrounding Verdun 
instead of the city itself, and Moevre valley was heavily fortified. The 
Germans could only take certain cement government roads, and consequently, 
since the French had guarded the positions, the Germans could not move 
without heavy losses. For this reason this swampy area is called the blood- 
soaked plain of the Moevre. 
Another way the net work of ravines and ridges helped the French 
was in the second attack, when the Germans tried to go over the escarp-
-P-A-G-E-134
Year Boox 133 
ment and cross the Meuse river, We do not know much about this, 
except that it also was a failure. 
The third attempt, the Germans tried to go up the river to Verdun and 
capture it in that way, but this also was unsuccessful. 
‘The reason that the Germans.wanted Verdun was not only because of 
the military advantages, but also for the prestige, because they felt that if 
- they were successful in this battle the war would be practically over, and 
they wanted the neutral countries, of which there were a great many (our 
own among the number), to come in and side with them. This battle 
shows how the topography helped the French, as it has in almost. every 
large battle that has been fought. ” 7 . 
  TOPOGRAPHIC MAP OF HILL IN LINCOLN PARK 
(Contour intervals 2 ft.; scale, 20 ft. to r in.) 
From this year’s portfolio, I take Margaretta’s paper on. The 
Making of a Topographic Map, which will, I hope be clear to suc- 
ceeding classes, Before we mapped the hill, we had found the
-P-A-G-E-135

  SETTING THE PLANE TABLE 
elevation of its highest part by measuring up from the lake, datum 
581. ° * * * 
Now that we have the height of the hill, we are ready to work from 
it to find the elevation of various points, in order to make a topographic 
map. The instruments we use are as follows: The plane-table, which was 
made by some high-school boys, and consists of a drawing-board screwed 
to a tripod; a level, like a carpenter’s level, with sights on it, so that another 
object of the same height may be sighted by looking through the hole in 
the first sight and moving the object until it is on the same level; a chain 
or tape about fifty feet long; a ruler; a pole, which is about six feet high, 
painted in_red and white stripes, so that it can be well seen; a plumb-line; a 
compass; a paper and pencil. 
We tack a sheet of paper to the plane-table, set our table up a short 
distance down the hill, level it and orient it. To level the table, we put 
the level on top of the drawing-board, and move the legs of the tripod in 
and out until the bubble of the level is in the middfe. Then the level is 
placed at right angles to its former position and the table leveled in that 
direction also. To orient the table, a compass is laid on the corner the 
first time the table is set up, and a line is drawn north and south. Every 
time the table is set up thereafter, the compass is set on it and the table 
is turned so. that this line still runs north and south. We worked in groups 
of about five children each, so that every one could have a chance to see 
and to work. 
Now that our table is set up, we are ready to take the back sight. 
We put our pole on the bench-mark, the top of the hill, We fook through
-P-A-G-E-136
Yxar Boox 135 
the sights on the level, and the girl at the pole moves her hand up and 
down until it can be seen on the thread of the second sight. The distance 
of the hand from thé ground is then measured and if it is one foot, we 
know that the elevation of the sight is 618.5 feet, because our bench-mark 
is 617.5 and the sight is level with the spot on the pole, which is one foot 
higher. If when we drop our plumb-line we find that the drawing-board 
is three feet from the ground, and the thickness of the board and the level 
up to the sight is six inches, we know that the elevation of the point 
where the plane-table stands is 3.5 feet lower than the sight, or 615. feet. 
In order that we may put the dot on our paper, corresponding to this 
point, we must measure the distance and mark it'to scale. We find the 
distance to be 30 feet. We use a scale of 20 feet to the inch. Our dot 
will therefore be 114 inches away from the dot which represents the top of 
the hill. We put our ruler on the papér so that it points from the dot 
representing the bench-mark directly at the pole. Then the new dot is 
made, 15 inches from the bench-mark, and marked with its elevation 615 
feet. We can now move our pole. Our next observations are easier, 
because we find the elevation of the spots where the pole stands instead of 
the spot where the plumb-line falls. We can move our pole and make 
many dots before we move the plane-table. 
The groups all go in different directions, and after they have all 
covered their sections with dots, the papers are laid together with their 
center dots together, and the north and south lines parallel. Then, by 
means of transfer-paper, the dots are all transferred to one sheet. 
Now that we have the dots all on one sheet, we are ready to draw 
the contour-lines. As the top of the hill is 617 feet and our contour interval 
is 2 feet, our first contour would be at 615 feet. If there are any dots at 
that elevation, we draw the line through them. We draw it half-way be- 
tween the 616-foot dot and the 614-foot dot, and two-thirds of the way 
between a 617-foot dot ‘and a 614-foot -dot. In this way we draw our 
contours every 2 feet. Any one can see from this map the shape and size 
of this hill and which slopes were steep and which gentle.

These are war times. ‘Teachers now more than ever may be 
thankful if their curriculum is elastic. Every subject—history, liter- 
ature, music, mathematics—has a fresh appeal for pupils in the lurid 
light of the world war, and physiography not the least. River piracy 
caused the great Toul gap; the incised meanders of the Aisne cost the 
British army countless lives; the Moevre is blood-soaked on account 
of its impermeable clay; the Verdun region is like our North Shore ; 
the map of the Champagne Front shows a bewildering mass of topo- 
graphic detail, every line of which may have life and death sig- 
nificance. Boys and girls want to know everything about the war.

SCIENCE IN THE HIGH SCHOOL 
  
High-school science is at present in a marked state of flux and 
change. The need for reorganization is‘ generally felt, though the 
character of the reorganization which shall bring about the desired 
results is by no means clear. The number of sciences offered to high- 
school pupils has greatly increased, but as yet little sequence or logical 
development from one course to another has been developed. There 
is wide divergence in the selection of subject matter, and in the 
methods of its presentation. Reorganization is also taking place within 
each of the individual science courses, in the effort to secure a better 
selection of subject matter and more efficient methods of teaching. 
For this reason, a brief statement of the aims and purposes of the 
high-school science courses, as taught in this school, and also of the 
principles governing the selection of-material and methods of presenta- 
tion, is in order. 
AIMS AND PURPOSES OF HIGH-SCHOOL SCIENCE 
1. Science courses aim to give the pupil an intelligent under- 
standing of the significance and importance of science to our modern 
life. The success of democracy depends upon the intelligence, insight, 
and social responsibility of all its citizens. Science instruction is in- 
dispensable to breadth of view and the intelligent discharge of the 
duties and responsibilities of citizenship. 
2. The courses in science should develop specific interests, habits, 
and abilities. Modern psychologists have seriously called into question 
the possibility of training those general abilities called powers ot 
observation, interpretation, discrimination, deduction, 1magination, 
ete., as such, but the high-school science courses do call for the ex- 
ercise of specific powers of observation, for specific habits of industry 
and accuracy, and for skill in manipulation of a particular sort. It 
is a vital characteristic of good science instruction that it should 
stimulate the pupil to more direct and purposeful activity and to a 
higher realization of his own powers and abilities and the pleasure 
and profit to be found in their exercise and development. The char- 
acter of science material, its immediate bearing on the common things 
138
-P-A-G-E-140
“Yrar Boox 139 
of every-day life, gives to science study an unusual opportunity .to 
develop the power of initiative and independent thought. This is the 
highest of educational aims, for it is only by the increments of per- 
sonal achievement that society advances. 
3. Science study should supply a fund of information, useful, 
practical and of immediate service in home and daily life. This 
knowledge should be of direct assistance to the pupil in enabling him 
to select-more intelligently and surely future vocations or courses of 
study, and to adjust himself more easily and wisely to new situations. 
By useful information is not meant that which is immediately useful 
-only, or practical in a narrow sense, but ali that which makes for a 
better understanding of the corfditions, institutions, and demands of 
modern life. : : 
Science study also opens the door.to many useful and pleasure- 
able avocations. Thus it provides for the intelligent and profitable 
use of leisure time. : 
4, Science study possesses especial value, by reason of the ex- 
perimental work which gives the pupil a varied contact with actual 
materials of many kinds. This active sort of experience is in marked 
contrast with the sort obtained from books, diagrams, maps, and other 
symbolic materials, so prominent in most subjects of study. 
5. Science study possesses cultural, esthetic, and moral values. 
A false dualism would classify the subjects of the curriculum as 
esthetic and cultural on the one hand, and practical and materialistic 
on the other. On the contrary, all subjects are cultural to the degree 
‘in which they develop appreciation, and all are esthetic to the degree 
in which they open the eyes to the perception of new beauty and in- 
crease the power to enjoy the wonders of thes world in which 
we live. Science study, properly conducted, develops an appreciation 
of the inner meanings and-connections of things and the interrelation 
of facts and phenomena, an appreciation of the service of science to 
the life and civilization of our time, an appreciation of the slow, 
painstaking efforts and tremendous toil with which scientific progress 
has been accomplished, and an appreciation of the privileges, duties, 
and responsibilities which living in this age of science involves. The 
. natural sciences, especially, since they deal directly with nature, 
should open the eyes of the pupil to the beauty and wonders of nature 
and the divine economy which has shaped and fashioned it all. These 
cultural and esthetic values of science relate directly to moral values
-P-A-G-E-141
140 . Francis W. Parker ScHoon 
and are the bases of moral concepts and the well-springs of moral 
action, in the building up of individual character and the refinement 
of individual ideals. 
PRINCIPLES CONTROLLING THE SELECTION OF MATE- 
RIAL AND METHODS OF PRESENTATION 
The most notable innovation in high-school science teaching in 
recent years has been the introduction. of the project-problem method. 
As has been pointed out in the preceding sections of this course of 
study, the questions, problems, and activities of the child have been 
taken as the basis for all the science work of the school. This is sub- 
stantially what is meant by the project-problem method of teaching 
science, and as such it has been the method for the science work of the 
school from its foundation. In the pages which follow, the attempt 
is made to show clearly how this method has been worked out. 
The adoption of this general method as a basis for high-school 
science involves a considerable. modification of the methods usually 
followed. The assignment of lessons can no longer be made, as the 
“next chapter” or “the next ten pages.” Instead, the assignments 
must be made on the basis of questions or problems which appeal to 
the pupil as worth knowing. This conception of the worth-whileness 
of the work is the motive which secures more purposeful and more 
efficient study, a more interested participation in recitations and class 
discussion, a clearer understanding of the laboratory work as an in- 
tegral part of the work of the course, and one of the chief means for 
answering the questions and problems under consideration. 
Teaching s¢ience by this method requires adequate library facil- 
ities, including several copies of each of the standard textbooks, cur- 
rent scientific magazines of a non-technical sort, many reference books 
and articles on special subjects, written in a style calculated to appeal 
to the adolescent mind. Assignments should be made to all these 
sources of information, where the answers to the questions and prob- 
lems selected for study can be found. This method requires a large 
measure of co-operation between pupil and teacher, and recitations 
which are truly sovialized, because the pupils are really contributing 
towards the solution of problems common to all. 
From an ideal standpoint, pupils should take the initiative in 
raising questions and problems, and in directing their own study and
-P-A-G-E-142
YzEar Boox 141 
investigation. It has been the experience of the writer, however, that 
the pupils are unable to initiate at the outset very many of the prob- 
lems and projects which belong in the more advanced courses in the 
high school. Their interest has first to be aroused, the subject opened 
up, and the necessary impetus given to make the class realize its value 
to themselves. This can be done by the wise use of demonstration 
experiments, by emphasizing the relation of the work to community 
needs, school and home activities, local industries, and commercial 
applications. The service of members of the class, in securing useful 
material for experiments, in collecting special information for class 
use, in reporting on special topics or additional experiments, assists 
in securing this vital element of co-operation of teacher and class. 
The general condition of unrest and the search for a better or- 
ganization of the science work has been reflected to some degree in 
our own high school. Courses in physiology, physiography, biology, 
botany, and general science, have all had a temporary place in our 
curriculum, and then have been discarded, so that for the present 
year we are offering domestic science, physics, chemistry, and a brief 
course in hygiene. The other science courses have hardly had an 
adequate opportunity to prove their worth, for the lack of laboratory 
facilities and room for necessary equipment has handicapped these 
courses. This reduced number of science subjects is partly offset by 
the fact that both physics and chemistry are taken by a very large 
majority in every class, while one of the two is required of every pupil. 
Further, the science work which has been given in the elementary 
school has furnished a background of experience which has made it 
possible for pupils to pass into the high-school science courses with- 
out the difficulties which usually attend the transition from grades 
to high school. The lack of a.course in biology is a serious deficiency 
in our high-school science course, but one which it is difficult to cor- 
rect until enlarged facilities make it possible to undertake it upon 
the proper basis.
-P-A-G-E-143
HYGIENE 
  
The following course in hygiene has been given the past few 
years by the directors of physical education to the freshmen class of 
the high school, the boys and girls being in separate groups. 
The study of hygiene must have for its basis some knowledge of - 
the structure and function of the body and its organs, hence enough 
anatomy and physiology to make the subject intelligible must be in- 
cluded. . 
Much of the course as here outlined is quite elementary in char- 
acter; it could, and in my judgment should be given in the elementary 
school, beginning perhaps in the fifth or sixth grades, or even earlier, 
where the awakening curiosity about the body, its functions and care 
would supply a direct motive for this study. There is no good reason 
for postponing this study until the high school is reached, and there 
are many good reasons for beginning it earlier. First, the fact that 
personal: habits are more easily and permanently fixed during the 
plastic years of younger childhood. If study of the care of the body is 
to result in setting up sound habits of hygienic living and right ideals 
of physical fitness, it would seem wise to-make children intelligent 
along these lines before wrong or careless habits are fixed, and when 
it is easier to implant good habits. Secondly, it is in the earlier grades 
that there is normal ‘curiosity and genuine interest in the body, and 
children have many questions which should be answered carefully, 
wisely, and definitely. 
Children of the earlier grades can quite easily grasp the laws 
which underlie the structure and care of the teeth, the main facts of ~ 
digestion, the choice of foods and the hygiene of eating; the reasons 
for cleanliness, the value of exercise and its effects upon every part 
of the body. 
The seventh and eighth grades can understand the main facts of 
the structure and care of the respiratory and circulatory organs, the 
care of eyes and ears, the cause and treatment of common colds, the 
seasonal changes of clothing, etc. 
It is in these grammar grades that the majority of the girls ma- 
ture and the boys enter their pubescent period, hence it would seem 
that this is the place to give to boys and girls, in separate groups, care- 
ful instruction in the meaning of the new functions which now develop, 
142
-P-A-G-E-144
Year Boox 143 
so that they may understand the physical changes and new emotions 
which now manifest themselves, and be taught intelligent care of them- 
selves at this crucial time of life. 
If the topics here suggested were covered broadly in the elemen- 
tary school, the field would be clear for work in laboratory physiology 
in connection with a high-school course in biology, to round out the 
study of the structure, function, and care of the human body. 
Some such course as this is the ideal toward which we are looking. 
Lack of space, laboratory facilities and program difficulties have so far 
prevented us from realizing this ideal. We have, however, hope for the 
future.

DOMESTIC SCIENCE 
  
Let me suggest that every housewife who practices strict economy 
puts herself in the ranks of those who serve the nation. This is the time 
for America to correct her unpardonable fault of wastefulness and extrava- 
gance. Let every man and woman assume the duty of careful provident 
use and expenditure as a public duty, as a dictate of patriotism which no. 
one can now expect ever to be excused or forgiven for ignoring. (Procla- 
mation of April 15, 1917.) President Wilson. 
The work in domestic science is given in the belief that every girl 
should have before her the highest ideals of home life and the great 
social service it has always rendered. It is hoped that she will gain a 
comprehension of the principles of home-making and the ability to put 
them into successful operation. In the present crisis in our country’s 
history the knowledge of management and economy in the home means 
for the girl service to the nation. 
, The course in domestic science covers two years-in the high school. 
The work in foods of the first year leads naturally to the broader prob- 
lems of the home which form the basis for the second year’s work. In 
the first year of her work the girl deals with one of the big problems 
of the present day, that of economy in the home. She studies the selec- 
tion and purchasing of foods from the standpoint of expenditure; she 
visits markets and related industries; she prepares and serves suitable 
meals,as a foundation for her work in food values; she performs prac- 
tical experiments in food cookery and keeps a careful record of them. 
Right habits of work and the importance of sanitation are especially 
stressed. 
The proclamation by the president, given at the beginning of this 
article, forms the basis for all the problems of this year. 
The following shows these problems and the opportunities for 
vitalizing the work: 
Problem I.—-What can I learn about the preservation of food this fall 
which will help in the campaign for preventing waste? Lessons 
in canning and preserving fruits and vegetables. 
OPPORTUNITIES FOR VITALIZING WorK— 
(a) Sending products to the Red Cross. 
(b) Taking products to families in need. . 
{c) “County Fair” and other food sales, the profits going to some de- 
serving charity. 
(d) Using products of class work for school luncheons, parties, etc. 
145
-P-A-G-E-147
146 Francis W. Parker ScHoon 
Problem IJ,—What can I learn this winter about preparing and serv- 
ing meals so that I can really help “to practice strict economy ?” 
(a) What must I know of the sanitation of foods if I am to do my 
share in keeping everyone in good health? 
(b) How can I buy foods and be sure that they are the best and yet 
the most economical? 
(c}) What ought I to know of food values to be sure that I am supply- 
ing the nourishment that the body needs? 
(d) What must I know of the preparation and cooking of foods to be 
“ sure that I am obtaining the best from them? 
(e) What ought I to know about serving meals so that they wilt be 
simple and pleasing? 
(f) If the table is to be attractive, I ought to know about laundering 
linens. What can I fearn of this? 
OpporTUNITIES FOR VITALIZING THE WorK— 
(a) Serve meals for special groups of teachers or pupils in the school. 
(b) Serve the parents a luncheon during the year. 
(c) Co-operation in the home. 
Problem III—My.mother is very busy with Red Cross work. What © 
can I learn about the care of the baby that will make it possible 
for me to take charge when necessary? Lessons in bathing the 
baby and in the care of the baby’s bottle. 
OpportuNities FoR ViTALIZING THE WorkK— 
(a) Co-operation with day nurseries and settlements. 
(b) Co-operation wherever possible in the home. 
Problem IV.—Nurses are being called away every day. What can I 
learn of the ordinary care of the sick in the home that will make 
me feel that I am doing my share at this time? Lessons on 
preparation of invalid’s tray-and the care of the sick-room. 
OProrTUNITIES FOR VITALIZING THE Work— 
(a) Co-operation with a hospital or institution. 
(b) Co-operation with Red Cross work. 
(c) Co-operation in the home. 
The second year’s work has been taken up only by a limited num- 
ber of girls during one year. This course was given before the prob- 
lem method had been so thoroughly worked out and for this reason, 
merely the larger problems are indicated. These are varied in nature 
and are seleeted as they seem suited to the needs of the class. They 
include not only the application to the home of such scientific prin- 
ciples as heating, lighting, and ventilation, but also an appreciation of 
household furnishing and decoration. In the second half of this year 
the class studies simple problems in dietetics and meal-planning, and 
each one works out a budget for her own family.
-P-A-G-E-148
PHYSICS   
The course in physics is given in the eleventh grade,.and con- 
tinues throughout the year, with a time allotment of six periods a 
week, two of which are consecutive for laboratory work. The class of 
twenty-four is divided into two sections for the laboratory work, and 
also for one of the other single periods, so that it may be utilized for 
either experiment or recitation. From the standpoint of subject mat- 
ter, the major topics covered by the recitations and experimental work 
do not greatly differ from: the standard high-school course; nor, in- 
deed, can it be otherwise, since the course must meet the requirements 
of colleges to which our graduates are certified, and also be an ade- 
quate preparation for pupils going up for College Board examinations. 
There is no need, therefore, in presenting in this article the sub- 
ject matter of the course by listing the topics studied; but rather it 
will be the purpose to show wherein methods of presentation have been 
developed which are in harmony with the fundamental principles 
which have been accepted as controlling all science work throughout 
the school, to indicate to what extent we have been successful in finding 
projects and problems in physics which the pupils have made their 
own and which they have pursued with that eagerness and zest which 
is the hall-mark of every project. Much has been written in favor of 
the project method of teaching science, and especially as a method for 
better physics teaching; but lists of projects, problems, questions, ex- 
periments, etc. which really work in the classroom and laboratory are 
difficult to find in print, and still more difficult to discover for oneself. 
Such lists will never be adequate for the needs of physics teachers until 
some plan is devised, whereby there may be a pooling of information 
and the results obtained by individual teachers may be made 
available to all. As a contribution in this direction, and not as a fin- 
ished piece of work, this article is written. It is the result of several 
years’ effort to break away from the time-honored method of teaching 
physics by the assignment of lessons from textbook and laboratory 
manual, and to discover projects by which the interest of the pupil may 
be aroused and all his powers focused for educative effort. The trans- 
formation is not one which’ can be effected all at once. It is only by 
making a beginning here and there and gradually extending the num- 
ber and scope of projects that in time the whole of physics teaching 
may be successfully remodeled.. 
ur
-P-A-G-E-149
148. Francois W. Parker ScHOOL 
The adoption of the project method for physics teaching at once 
makes impossible the usual method of assigning lessons, and neces- 
sitates the use of textbooks for reference purposes, and the use of a 
variety of the latter as a source of information on many topics. A well- 
chosen set of reference books will not only contain the necessary in- 
formation, but contain it in a way which is attractive and interesting 
to boys and girls of adolescent age. It is extremely important that 
assignments should be clear and definite. Nothing is more discourag- 
ing to the pupil, or destructive of his interest, than to be given hazy 
assignments, to come to feel that neither he nor the teacher knows 
exactly what is-expected. It is of vital importance that the teacher 
should have gone over the ground carefully, and that assignments to 
reference books should be as definite and clear to the pupil as possible. 
This year pupils were asked to buy a standard textbook, in order 
that they might be sure of having a reference book, one which they 
might use most frequently. At the end of the article is appended a list 
of books which have been found useful and which are kept upon a 
special shelf in the grade room, where they are readily available for 
reference and use in study periods. Each book is provided with a long 
narrow strip of cardboard, bearing the title and library number of the 
book. A pupil taking out the book over night, or out of the room for 
study, signs his name on the slip and places it upon a spindle near the 
reference shelf. On returning the book he crosses off his name on the 
slip, replaces it in the book and returns the book to the shelf. This 
simple system prevents the abuse of reference books, renders checking 
them up easy, and at the same time keeps them readily available. 
The following is alist of topics, with correlated projects, prob- 
lems, questions, excursions, and experiments, which have been used in 
daily assignments. A number of these are given in full, with the ref- 
erences, to illustrate the method, while others are only listed. Many 
questions of this sort may be found at the ends of chapters in the more 
common textbooks, where they are placed for purposes of review. It is 
the raising of these questions in the mind of the pupil prior to the 
assignment which makes them worth while and significant. To the 
degree that the student makes them his own problems and seeks the 
answers by reason of his own desire to know, to that extent they become 
projects and the pupil’s efforts educative. This is the vital distinction 
between the old and new methods. The information is sought as a re- 
sult of a question which the pupil desires to answer, and the question 
is not given as a test of the thoroughness with which facts and prin-

CHEMISTRY 
  
The world war has emphasized as never before the essential part 
which chemistry plays not only in modern warfare, but in industry, 
agriculture, and commerce as well. While chemical knowledge and 
inventive genius has been concerned with the manufacture of high ex- 
plosives, in the development of special steel for shells and cannon, in 
the production of deadly gases, and other means of accomplishing 
utter and complete destruction, it has been equally active in discover- 
ing agencies for combating the effects of these terrible substances and 
alleviating the suffering which they cause, in finding substitutes for 
needed commodities, and in developing new industries to supply 
articles, formerly imported. 
The public is also coming to appreciate as never before the need 
of a wider dissemination and utilization of chemical knowledge if 
economic independence is to be ours in the keen competition which 
will follow the advent of peace. High-school chemistry teachers have 
a very real opportunity in the present situation to emphasize the need 
of more efficient use of our natural resources and of the production, 
adequate for all our needs, of dyes, potash, drugs, nitrates, and other 
chemicals of fundamental importance. 
The increased application of chemistry to industry is likely to re- 
sult in an increased interest in chemistry as a part of a complete edu- 
cation. High-school chemistry instruction, therefore, should not aim 
to develop trained chemists but to give to all students an intelligent 
understanding of the significance and importance of chemistry to our 
modern life which will serve as a basis of appreciation and future en- 
couragement of chemical industry. This is the primary aim of the 
course in chemistry as taught in this school. 
Chemistry teachers have been slow to adopt the project method 
of teaching, and only an extreme radical would affirm that this method 
is applicable without considerable modification of the course in chem- 
istry. The objections which are commonly raised to teaching chemistry 
by projects or problems are as follows: 
(a) Many problems and questions raised by pupils involve com- 
plex phases of chemistry, or ideas too advanced for their understand- 
ing. For example, the difficulty in getting proper dyes makes this a 
topic of considerable interest, but in the elementary chemistry course 
160
-P-A-G-E-162
Yzar Boox 161 
it can be given only a very superficial treatment, and that well towards 
the end of the year. The manufacture of high explosives is another 
' similar topic which involves technical matters of too great difficulty 
for the beginner. 
(b) Many of the great principles of chemistry, because of the 
impossibility of direct or experimental proof, cannot be arrived at 
easily by the immature mind. They are philosophic concepts, which 
have to be accepted on the grownd of their service to science and the 
useful conclusions which are based upon them; for example, the 
assumptions of the atomic hypothesis, or the rule of Avagadro. 
(c) The array of principles and facts is so great that the student 
is almost helpless before them, and unless the basis for establishing 
relationships and controlling facts is first developed, there can be no 
appreciation of the scientific method and no proper organization of 
the information supplied by discussion, investigation, and experiment. 
These reasons are not easily disregarded, yet some motive, some 
compelling inner desire is just as essential to educative effort in chem- 
istry as in elementary science.. How, then, can these opposing argu- 
ments be reconciled and a tentative basis for teaching chemistry be 
established? Does not the answer lie in the changing character of the 
pupil’s interests and in the enlarged scope which his problems and 
projects may take on as a result of his growing abilities and his in- 
creased power to direct and focus them? 
The test of a problem, its significance to the pupil, lies not in its 
concreteness or the useful application which it involves, nor the famil- 
jar associations which relate it to other problems, but in the degree to 
which the pupil makes it his own and identifies himself with it, be- 
cause of his belief of its worth-whileness. Under skilful teaching, 
may not that question, which a year or even a few months earlier would 
have seemed abstruse and uninteresting, become a real, live, practical 
problem? In other words, does not the desire come to some pupils, 
and should it not come much more generally, to know what the 
constitution of things really is, what the atoms are, and what prop- 
erties they possess ; why the volumes of reacting gases have such simple 
relations to one another ; or why the weights of equal volumes of gases 
show such striking regularities? The adolescent is easily aroused. He 
is not yet encased in a shell of limited and selfish interests. Ultimate 
causes and reactions appeal'to him as perhaps at no other time of his 
life. If the chemistry teacher can kindle this inner spark of natural 
interest into the flame of real desire, then those matters which before
-P-A-G-E-163
162 Francis W. Parker Scroon 
seemed dry as dust may take on a new and vital aspect and become as 
truly problems: as any which have yet been found i in the introductory 
science courses. 
The laboratory work especially ought to deal with problems and 
questions which grow out of class and-home study, problems having to 
do with the home, the farm, local industries, personal and civic welfare. 
Towards this end the titles of experiments can often be improved and 
made more suggestive by stating them in problem or question form. 
For example, instead of the title Mordant Dyeing, a better one is Why 
are Mordants Used in Dyeing? or, in place of Bquivalent Weight of 
Magnesium, How Much Magnesium is Needed to Produce a Gram of 
Hydrogen? for Analysis of Ammonia, What is the Most Economical 
Brand of Household Ammonia to Purchase? The main idea of each 
experiment should be given definite statement at the outset. This may 
be stated as a purpose: Z’o Show the Method by Which the NaOH of 
Commerce is Prepared, or as a question: Does the Vinegar of Your 
Grocer Come up to the Legal Standard? The mere statement NaOH 
or Vinegar at the top of the direction sheet is not suggestive and 
. should be discouraged. There should be a logical sequence of experi- 
ments. That is, each experiment should not be all-sufficient to itself, 
but should grow out of the preceding work and at the same time have 
regard for the coming work. 
The course in this school is given in the senior year with a time 
allotment of six periods per week, two of which are consecutive for 
laboratory work. Laboratory sections are limited to twelve each on 
account of the size of the laboratory. The same division into sections 
is maintained for one of the four remaining periods, so that it may be 
used for either laboratory or recitation purposes as required. It is 
based upon the following outline which shows the organization only 
upon broad lines and is followed by a number of type topics in order 
to illustrate to better advantage the method of teaching.

TYPE TOPICS MORE FULLY OUTLINED 
OXIDATION 
After the laboratory preparation and testing of oxygen, to deter- 
mine its physical and chemical properties, the topics and questions for 
assignment and discussion include the following: 
How was oxygen discovered? How abundant is it? 
How is rusting and decay different from burning? 
What is spontaneous combustion, and how may it be averted? 
Why is perfect combustion necessary in furnaces and steam-power 
plants? 
Why is imperfect combustion dangerous in stoves and grates?
-P-A-G-E-166
Year Boox 165 
Why is coal dust explosive? 
Questions of this sort are usually found at the end of chapters 
in the ordinary textbooks, and ‘serve chiefly for review or for making 
application of the ideas brought out in the chapter. By reversing the 
order, and suggesting them to the pupil before he begins his reading, 
his home-study may be rendered much more purposeful and effective. 
The class discussion answers the above questions and serves to 
bring out many others of a similar character. 
TESTING AND PURIFICATION OF WATER 
The initial laboratory experiment answers the questions: 
What are the common impurities in water? 
How may they be identified and removed ? 
This work involves sedimentation ; filtration; tests for sulphates, 
’ chlorides, calcium compounds and other dissolved minerals; distilla- 
tion, including fractional distillation ; and boiling to destroy bacteria. 
In a class discussion following the experiment, the importance of 
an adequate supply of pure water to every city, town, and community is 
brought out, and the question raised as to which of the methods 
studied in the laboratory can be carried out on a commercial basis. 
The need of more efficient methods is apparent, and the assignment to 
the reference books is based upon the following questions: 
Why does a laundry need soft water? 
What is boiler scale? 
How may roily river water be made clear and safe for drinking? 
How is our own water-supply protected and purified? 
At the next recitation these questions are answered, and many 
others which are raised by members of the class. Demonstration ex- 
periments of the coagulation method of water purification, and of the 
softening power of commercial preparations, such as Permutit, are 
included. Specimens of boiler scale, a section of an old boiler-tube, 
and an old teakettle, are shown to the class. Excursions to pumping- 
station and municipal water-laboratory follow. 
Another worth-while laboratory experiment is to have the class 
test the hardness of many varieties of natural spring and mineral 
waters, supplying their own samples from springs, wells, artesian 
water, or commercial bottled varieties. The work takes the plan of a 
rough analysis, and includes a determination of the percent of total 
dissolved solids; the identification of the mineral salts present as far 
as possible; the determination of the degree of hardness, using a
-P-A-G-E-167
166 Franois W. Parker ScHoon 
standard solution of liquid soap; and a spectroscopic examination of 
the residue from evaporation of a sample. 
TESTING FOOD PRODUCTS 
This topic is introduced by asking the class how much of the food 
they eat is preserved? Copies of a few menus from the school Iunch- 
room are shown, which make it clear to all that food preserved in some 
manner constitutes a large percent of that normally consumed. This 
suggests the following questions: 
Are foods preserved in certain ways injurious? 
How is the public protected from the improper use of preserva- 
tives, adulteration, and misbranding ? 
What are the preservatives likely to be found in various products? ? 
How may they be identified? 
The assignment covers these questions and copies of the National 
Pure Food and Drug Acts are placed on the reference shelf. The class 
discussion has as its outcome a conception of the complex machinery 
of national and state supervision of food products, and of the kind of 
problems with which a food chemist must deal. 
Pupils’ are asked to provide themselves with samples of all sorts 
of food for the laboratory testing, which immediately follows this dis- 
cussion.» In order to secure a choice of samples worth testing, the 
laboratory direction sheet is given out in advance. It supplies direc- 
tions for testing food-products for: : 
Sulphur dioxide or sulphites in 1 dried and preserved fruits and 
meats. 
Coal-tar dyes in candy, preserves and ‘ices. 
Flour or starch in candy and jellies. 
Alum, copper, and tumeric in pickles. 
Boric acid or borax in crackers or ice-cream cones. 
~ Reference books for other tests are at hand to meet any particular 
problems that seem worth while in individual cases. 
Following this laboratory work, the next recitation calls for a 
general summing up of restlts,’so that the scope of the testing is ap- 
parent’ to all. 
_ FIXATION OF NITROGEN. 
This topic is one of particular interest and affords exceptional 
opportunity to bring’ home to the pupil the wonderful achievements of 
chemistry in this field.
-P-A-G-E-168
' Yxar Boox 167 
After the composition of the air has been studied and determined 
in the laboratory, these questions naturally arise: 
Does the nitrogen of.the air serve any useful purpose? 
Can this vast quantity of nitrogen be turned into useful products? 
What compounds of nitrogen are needed, and for what purposes? 
With these questions as a basis, the class is given an assignment 
to the textbooks and reference material bringing out the importance of 
nitrogen compounds; of nitric acid for explosives, celluloid, and gun- 
cotton; of ammonia for munitions and refrigeration; of nitrates for 
soil fertility. The class discussion serves to emphasize the vital need 
of all these products and their manufacture in large quantities. In 
this discussion are included the following topics: 
The nitrogen cycle, which is fully worked out and discussed. 
The Birkland-Eynde and Haber processes for making nitric acid. 
The Oswald process for making cyanamide! and ammonia. 
Coal as a source of ammonia. The wastefulness of the beehive 
oven is compared with the efficient utilization of the full value of coal 
in by-product ovens. The necessity for conserving the nitrogen com- 
pounds coming from coa] is emphasized. 
The final question under this topic is: What is being done in our 
own country to supply our needs for nitrogen compounds? 
Newspaper clippings, magazine articles, ete., are of use in bring- 
ing this question right up to the minute and driving home its sig- 
nificance. : 
SOAP AND CONSERVATION OF FATS 
The demand of the government for conservation of fats as a war 
measure makes an especial appeal to this topic at the present time. 
Why are fats important in time of war? This question involves 
the recovery of glycerine as a by-product in soap-making and its con- 
version into nitro-glycerine and dynamite. Members of the chemistry 
class have a real opportunity to aid in this conservation movement, 
and to see to it that no fat is wasted in their homes, and that all not 
used for cooking is converted into soap. The production of a good 
soap, from any accumulation of waste fat, no matter how rancid, is a 
laboratory experiment of special merit. It brings home the practical 
usefulness of the chemical knowledge acquired not only to the pupil 
but to parents and friends as well. 
This experiment can be done at home as well as or better than in 
the laboratory. In this way it tends to correct the rather prevalent 
notion that chemistry experiments are limited to the school laboratory.

It will usually be found profitable to have pupils obtain recipes for 
making soap from home and other sources, and work out the final 
laboratory direction sheet as the result of testing. Pupils can be of 
real service to the cause of conservation by spreading the propaganda 
of home-made soap as the best way to utilize waste fat. 
The following recipe, as a laboratory direction sheet, has been 
tested by a number of pupils and found to give good results. 
MAKING SOAP FROM WASTE FAT 
Materials: 6 Ib. fat (accumulated drippings of any kind); %4 1b. borax; 
1 can Babbitt’s lye (crude NaOH). 
Dissolve the lye and the borax in 3 quarts of hot water, in an iron 
or enameled dish, and allow to cool. Melt the fat and strain through two 
layers of cheese-cloth, and allow to cool until pasty but not hard. Add the 
lye solution slowly to the fat, a little at a time, and with thorough stirring. 
After all is in, stir slowly for ten or fiften minutes, until the soap thickens. If 
the soap does not thicken after fifteen minutes of stirring, give it an occa- 
sional stlr until it does become pasty. Pour out into a pan lined with waxed 
or oil paper. When hard, cut into bars. 
If'a perfumed soap is desired, from 1 to 2 oz. of oil of lavender may be 
stirred in before pouring out.. Coloring material may also be added at the 
same time. Instead of pouring into a pan, small pasteboard boxes, such as 
match-boxes, ‘may be used as molds with good results.

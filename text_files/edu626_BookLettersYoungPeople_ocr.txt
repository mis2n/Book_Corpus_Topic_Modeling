  LETTERS AND LETTER-WRITING 
Early in the morning comes the postman. Sometimes a clear 
whistle heralds his approach, at first faint and far away. 
Then, drawing nearer, the welcome sound brings a thrill of ex- 
pectation to add to the joy of the opening day. Sometimes a 
thundering knock, or the more prosaic door-bell proclaims the 
coming of the postman. His well-packed bag is full of 
pleasures and surprises and mysteries; and each day, each post 
brings the hope that there may be something stowed away in 
its depths for us. Its possibilities are greater than those of any 
treasure chest of long ago; and the messenger of the post office 
who carries it is, from first to last, one of the most interesting 
figures in our lives. 
It is a simple matter for us to write a letter. The smooth, 
white, enticing paper, the pen, and convenient envelope are 
within our reach; the mail-box waits at every corner to re- 
ceive our letter; the small efficient stamp which is its passport 
costs only a few pennies. We post our letters secure in the 
knowledge that the unseen forces of the post office will carry 
them swiftly and safely to their destination. The ease and 
rapidity with which we can communicate with our friends are 
among the blessings of the twentieth century. 
It has been said that Atossa, a queen of Persia, who 
was the wife of Cambyses and the mother of Xerxes, invented 
letter-writing. This is a pretty legend, but letter-writing was 
not invented. It was a natural growth, developing as civiliza- 
tion and education developed, and increasing as people travelled 
farther from their homes and the need for such communication 
vil

grew. Strange writing materials were used in those dim, remote 
ages. The people of Babylon wrote upon bricks, and the early 
Chinese upon tables of stone similar to those spoken of in the 
Old Testament. Plates of lead and copper, on which the 
writing was done with a stylus of harder metal, were used in 
many lands in the shadowy days of history. The Hindus wrote 
upon the leaves of their strange, tropical trees; and the bark of 
the beech tree furnished writing material to the people of Saxon 
England. 
The inner bark of the linden tree was a _ favorite 
substance with the Persians, the Greeks, and especially the 
Romans, who not only used it for many different forms of 
writing, but made of it little notebooks which they often carried 
on their journeys. The tablets of wood, covered with wax, so 
often mentioned in ancient history, were much used by both 
Greeks and Romans. Sometimes two of these tablets were 
fastened together and the inner sides waxed, thus forming what 
were known as diptycha, whence comes our word diptych, mean- 
ing a hinged two-fold picture. The stylus for writing on these 
tablets was blunt at one end, pointed at the other,—the pointed 
end being used for the writing and the blunt end for the erasure 
of what had been written. 
Papyrus, made from the fibres of a plant which grew 
luxuriantly upon the banks of the River Nile, was the 
first material that in any way resembled our modern paper. 
The Egyptians, the Greeks, and the Romans valued it highly; 
and most of the ancient records in existence are written upon 
it. Upon the rolls of papyrus, the old scribes wrote with 
a reed dipped in some dark liquid which was the forerunner of 
our modern ink. In the third century, the Egyptians became 
jealous of this valuable product, and would not permit it to be 
taken out of their country. Then arose a great need for some- 
thing to take its place, a need which was met by the introduction 
of parchment and vellum, so much used by the monks of the 
viii

Middle Ages in their beautiful illuminated manuscripts. 
About the twelfth century, paper, which had been invented by 
the Chinese long before, found its way into Europe. It proved 
so useful and convenient that it gradually took the place of all 
other materials; and books, in larger numbers, became possible. 
When even the first letters were written, there was need for 
means of their transportation. A complete and efficient system 
of posts existed in the Persian empire in the days of Cyrus. At 
equal distances, stations were placed where men, with horses 
fresh and ready, waited to receive the letters from the weary 
messengers who had done their share of the journey, and carry 
them on to the next halting-place. These posts were used only 
by the government and for matters of state importance. The 
messengers ran grave risks; and much daring and endurance 
were required by the men performing this difficult task. Often 
there were secrets to be carried which could not be entrusted to 
ordinary writing. There is a story of one Histiaeus, who 
wished to send a secret message from Persia to his friend, 
Aristagoras in Greece. He shaved the head of a trusted 
servant; and, on the bare, smooth surface, wrote in some in- 
delible fashion the letter he wished to send. When the hair 
grew again upon the servant’s head, he set out upon his journey 
by land and sea. Upon reaching Miletus, he told his story to 
Aristagoras, who ordered the head of the faithful messenger to 
be shaved again, and read upon it the letter from his friend. 
The system of passing letters on until they reached their 
destinations by relays of men and horses came down through 
the centuries with few changes. As civilization advanced, as 
transportation became easier, travel became more general, and 
‘letters more numerous. The first organized system of posts in 
England seems to have been established in the reign of Queen 
Elizabeth; and the first post office dates from 1635. Then 
followed a period of gradual improvement in speed and safety. 
The letters were carried by the foot-post and the horse-post and 
ix ;
-P-A-G-E-8
    
LETTERS AND LETTER-WRITING 
passed on from carrier to carrier. There was always danger, 
in remote districts, of highwayman; and the safe delivery of 
letters depended entirely upon the intelligence and honesty of 
those who handled them. The danger of highwaymen did not 
decrease in the days of the stage-coach; it was no unusual event 
for a coach to be halted by masked robbers who rifled the 
contents of the mail-bags. 
Even a hundred years ago, the cost of sending a letter a long 
distance was considerable; so the writer carefully weighed the 
question as to whether his missive were worth the sending. 
Letters were written upon large sheets of paper, not a corner of 
which was left bare. ‘Thomas Carlyle, in writing to his sister, 
says: ‘‘Whatever you may think, it is not a “Ten minutes’ 
matter with me, the filling of a frank that will carry an ounce 
of thin writing paper; it is a decided business, which breaks the 
head of a Day for me; which breakage, however, I am generally 
well disposed to execute. Do you also take a large, even a 
long-shaped sheet, a clear pointed pen, and in the smallest hand 
you can master, repay it me.” Frequently these large sheets 
of paper were turned and covered with crosswise rows of writing. 
Then they were folded and sealed, for envelopes, in those days, 
were an unknown luxury. 
In 1840, penny postage was introduced into England 
by Sir Rowland Hill; and, about the same time, envelopes 
came into general use. They were, at first, very ornate 
affairs, engraved or otherwise adorned with various 
devices; many people with skill in drawing decorated them 
according to their fancy. ‘The most famous of these envelopes 
was the one designed by the artist, William Mulready, which 
represents Britannia with her shield and lion, and winged 
messengers joyfully bearing letters to distant continents. At 
this time, too, postage stamps were first used in England. The 
custom was immediately taken up by other nations, and, in a 
x
-P-A-G-E-9
  
  LETTERS AND LETTER-WRITING 
short time, was followed by practically every country in the 
world. 
In more recent years, Sir John Henniker Heaton, the English 
postal reformer, labored long to bring about lower postage rates 
between England and America, believing that the two great 
English-speaking nations might thus be drawn closely together. 
John Wanamaker had worked for the same result many years 
. before; and, in 1908, the reduction from five cents to two cents 
was made. One of Henniker Heaton’s warmest friends in 
America was Theodore Roosevelt. Just after midnight on 
October 1, 1908, during the first minutes when the two-cent rate 
was effective, Mr. Roosevelt posted a letter to his friend. in 
London, congratulating him upon having succeeded in his 
undertaking. Some months after, the two men met in London; 
and Mr. Roosevelt expressed his pleasure at having been able to 
send this letter of congratulation. “Yes,” said Henniker 
Heaton, “but why did you put a five-cent stamp on it?” 
Henniker Heaton was an untiring traveller. ‘There was hardly 
a country in the world which he had not visited; and he realized 
fully the part letters can play in the lives of all. His interest 
in reduced postage was first awakened by his pity for an old 
woman whom he saw in a country post office without sufficient 
money to send a letter to her son in Australia. 
So, through the centuries, since the days of Atossa and before 
them, there have been letters. The old foot-post and horse- 
post gave way to the stage coach which, in turn, gave way to 
fast mail trains. To-day, we are looking forward to the time 
when aerial mails will carry out letters still more swiftly, and 
transatlantic mail will reach us in a few hours. The impor- 
tant position that letters hold in the modern world is shown by 
the deference paid to the bulky mail sacks on train or ship- 
board. Everything must give place to the mails. 
We do not know whether Queen Atossa wrote interesting 
xi 
 
-P-A-G-E-10
  LETTERS AND LETTER-WRITING 
letters or not, for she has left us no record. The oldest letters 
we have with a familiar, personal touch are those of Cicero. 
One of the letters he wrote to his friend Atticus describes a visit 
from Julius Cesar, and tells of the provision he made to 
entertain his distinguished guest. Cicero had dreaded this 
visit, but all passed off to his satisfaction. Cesar “was rubbed 
and anointed . . . and ate and drank in a very free and easy 
manner; for he was entertained hospitably and elegantly; and 
our discourse resembled our repast in its relish and 
seasoning. . . . Yet,’ says his host, “he was not the man to 
whom one would say at parting, ‘I pray let me have this visit 
repeated when you come this way again.’ Once is enough.” 
Cicero’s letters are gracefully written with a skilful choice of 
words. He considered the writing of a good letter of the utmost 
importance. “I always accustom myself,” he says, “to write in 
the language of conversation.” 
It seems strange that a letter from Augustus Cesar to a little 
grandson should survive so many centuries. Yet there is one 
beginning “8 Kalend. October. Blessings upon thee, my dear 
little Caius, as dear to me as one of my eyes. When you are 
absent from me, I always feel the want of your presence.” It 
is not very different from an affectionate, grandfatherly letter of 
to-day; no form of writing less personal than a letter could 
so bridge the centuries since this old Roman lived and wrote. 
A letter is one of the most familiar things in our lives; and 
to write one has come to be one of our most simple, natural 
acts. Little children who have not learned to write love to 
scribble imitation letters; and their first real letters are im- 
portant events to them. The letters written in childhood are 
important, because they are the foundation upon which a habit 
that must last a life-time is to be built. Letter-writing is a 
good habit to learn early and an unselfish one. Like all habits, 
the earlier it is acquired, the more a part of one’s self it will 
xii 
 
-P-A-G-E-11
LETTERS AND LETTER-WRITING 
become; and the written words will be more natural, more 
graceful, more definitely an expression of the writer’s 
personality. 
The good habit of letter-writing also brings its own reward. 
Letters bind friendships that otherwise might fade away al- 
together. ‘The world is wide; and many are destined to spend 
their lives in its farthest, loneliest places. ‘To them, letters may 
be the only link with beloved friends and home. The years 
that Robert Louis Stevenson spent on an island in the South 
Seas would hardly have been endurable had not his friends 
in England and America so gladly and loyally answered de- 
lightful letters. Wherever we may go in this great world, the 
letters from our friends will follow us if we faithfully do our 
part in the correspondence. ‘To those who remain at home, 
letters from abroad are the next best things to foreign travel. 
On one of Sir Ernest Shackleton’s journeys to the Arctic 
regions, he wrote to his son Ray, “We are now up in cold 
weather, but it is clear and fine, and at night there is a wonder- 
ful aurora swinging in the sky. ‘The moon lies low on the ho- 
rizon and circles the head of the world. You could write a 
poem of all the beauty of this wonderful north.”’ 
Phillips Brooks, once the bishop of Massachusetts, was an 
enthusiastic traveller as well as a tireless letter-writer. From 
India, from Japan, from Turkey and the Holy Land, from 
every country in Europe, from trains and ocean liners, his let- 
ters brought back tidings of his wanderings. His little nieces 
were fortunate in receiving such letters from distant countries 
as he wrote to Gertie: ‘“‘When the little children in Venice 
want to take a bath, they just go down to the front steps of the 
house and jump off, and swim about in the street.”” Then he 
tells how he saw a nurse holding one end of a string, while the 
other end was fastened to a tiny boy who amused himself 
splashing and swimming in the street. “When he went too 
X11 
 
-P-A-G-E-12
    
LETTERS AND LETTER-WRITING 
far, the nurse pulled in the string, and got her baby home again.” 
Another of these little swimmers was tied to a post by the side 
of the door “so that when he tried to swim away to see another 
boy, who was tied to another door post up the street, he could n’t, 
and they had to sing out to one another over the water.” 
But the postman’s whistle does not blow nor the ‘double 
knock,” so loved by Dickens, sound for those who neglect their 
absent friends. Few letters are received by the tardy letter- 
writer. All of us have the desire or instinct to write letters 
—the rush of thoughts that we burn to tell a distant friend. 
A whole letter may write itself in our minds in this way. But, 
too often, through carelessness or the press of other affairs, 
the letter is never written. There is, too, a tendency to think 
that there must be something unusual to tell if the letter is 
to be interesting, a fear that the small happenings of every day 
are too trivial to write about,—little things which, if told in the 
right way, may make the best letters. There is no day so 
dull that something is not written on the clear tablets of memory. 
Those who read what is recorded there, in thought or word or 
deed, before the clear impression fades will find that every day 
is a story. A letter may be written of the quietest day’s adven- 
tures, real and vivid and pleasing. It should be written simply, 
without strain or effort; then truth and personality will have 
free play. 
Above all things, letters should be cheerful. Lewis Carroll 
was an almost perfect letter-writer in his own whimsical way. 
His letters to children brimmed over with happy nonsense. 
To one little girl, he wrote a tiny note: 
“Yes, my child, if all be well, I shall hope and you may 
fear, that the train reaching Hook at two eleven, will contain 
“Your loving friend, 
“C,. L. Dopcson.” 
XIV 
 
-P-A-G-E-13
    LETTERS AND LETTER-WRITING 
Sometimes he would slip in a few words of advice in an absurd 
and playful manner. A letter to Edith Rix ends with the 
words: 
“Now I come to your letter dated Dec. 22nd, and must scold 
you for saying that my solution of the problem was ‘quite dif- 
ferent to all common ways of doing it’; if you think that’s good 
English, well and good; but I must beg to differ from you, and 
to hope you will never write me a sentence similar to this again. 
However, ‘worse remains behind’; and if you deliberately intend 
in future, when writing to me about one of England’s greatest 
poets, to call him ‘Shelly,’ then all I can say is, that you and 
I will have to quarrel! Be warned in time. 
“C. L. Dopcson.” 
It may seem a long way from Lewis Carroll to Joel Chandler 
Harris, the creator of Uncle Remus and a host of other interest- 
ing personages; yet a similar quality was noted by many critics 
in their work. Joel Chandler Harris never dared to read Alice 
in Wonderland or Through the Looking Glass lest he should 
be accused of imitation. Like Lewis Carroll, this gentle- 
hearted genial writer loved children and answered promptly all 
children’s letters. His letters to his own family of boys and 
girls are written happily, humorously, tenderly. “I’m just as 
happy, almost, when things are going wrong, as I am when they 
are going right,” he wrote to his daughter Lillian, ‘and for a 
very good reason. It does n’t amount to a row of pins. There ’s 
nothing funnier than to see small troubles disappear when you 
laugh at them. They seem to get ashamed of themselves and 
run away.” This letter was dated May 2; and he signed it, 
“Vour affectionate Queen of the May.” To Mildred, another 
daughter, he sends advice about writing letters. ‘When you 
take up your pen just say to yourself, ‘Now I’m not going to 
write! I’m just going to talk to papa and mamma just as 
XV
-P-A-G-E-14
  LETTERS AND LETTER-WRITING 
though they were sitting here listening to every word I put down.’ 
That ’s the way I do when I write to you and Lillian.” Again © 
he says to Lillian, “There are two secrets of good writing that 
I will whisper in your ear. One is to write about something 
that interests you because you know it; the other is to be fa- 
miliar with and believe in the ideas you propose to write about. 
One secret refers to description, and the other to views, feelings, 
opinions.” He was an interesting figure in American life, 
sensitive and rather shy and intensely fond of home. He never 
went abroad, “because it is so far from home.” In his native 
state he collected the folklore and legends that fill his books. 
Theodore Roosevelt, so different from Harris in personality, 
was a warm friend and admirer; and James Whitcomb Riley 
journeyed from Indiana for delightful visits to “Snap-Bean 
Farm.” 
Theodore Roosevelt, too, was the author of some of the hap- 
piest letters that have been written to children. He is at his best 
when writing of Quentin, that small precocious boy, whose 
droll sayings and amusing exploits rejoiced his father’s heart. 
On one occasion, Quentin and the son of an Italian fruit- 
stand man set off on an expedition to get a bee-hive for a school 
exhibit. At the school “some of the bees got out and were left 
behind (‘Poor homeless miserables,’ as Quentin remarked of 
them), and yesterday they at intervals added great zest to the 
life of the class-room.”” Once Quentin procured a small pig 
for an animal man and took it home in a street car. “By that 
time the pig had freed itself from the bag, and, as he expressed 
it, he journeyed home with a ‘small squealish pig’ under his arm 
but as the conductor was a friend of his he was not put off.” 
He made twenty-five cents by this transaction; and the pig was 
decorated with red ribbons and “sent to parade the street.” 
Roosevelt rather suspected that Quentin had led the pig on 
part of its triumphal journey, but wisely refrained from too 
close questioning. Quentin now lies in a soldier’s grave in 
Xvl

LETTERS AND LETTER-WRITING 
France; but the little stories told of him by his father, as well 
as his own brave sacrifice, will keep his memory green. 
The letters in this little book have all been written by men and 
women known in literature. ‘Some of them were written when 
the writers themselves were children, as the letters from James 
Russell Lowell and Ralph Waldo Emerson. The love of youth 
and interest in its welfare are almost always well-defined traits 
in the characters of men of letters. Their letters to children 
are cheerful and sympathetic, sometimes humorous, sometimes 
filled with counsel from their wide experience. In one of 
Emerson’s letters to his daughter, he says: ‘Finish every day 
and be done with it. For manners and for wise living, it is 
a vice to remember. You have done what you could; some 
blunders and absurdities no doubt crept in; forget them as 
soon as you can. To-morrow is a new day; you shall begin 
it well and serenely, and with too high a spirit to be cumbered 
with your old nonsense. This day for all that is good and fair. 
It is too dear, with its hopes and invitations, to waste a moment 
on the rotten yesterdays.” 
There is much in these letters to give young readers pleasure; 
something to make them laugh, and something to make them 
think. Many of them are an expression of high courage, as the 
letters of Alan Seeger and Jack Wright. Thomas Hood wrote 
some of his gayest letters while ill and suffering; and Robert 
Louis Stevenson’s letters, as well as his books, are a revelation of 
his brave and merry heart. One should think, while reading 
these letters, of the writers, and of the children for whom the 
words were penned, some so long ago. Stern old Francis Jeffrey, 
Sir Walter Scott, and Benjamin Franklin give us a peep into 
family life of other times. Fathers, as Sir Robert Sidney and 
William Hazlitt, anxious for their sons’ welfare, endeavor to 
smooth their paths by sage advice. Pure nonsense plays its part; 
and, in this, Lewis Carroll, Dr. John Brown, Richard Barham, 
and William De Morgan are past masters. Much advice, too, 
XV11

is given on letter-writing itself, the old, old craft, yet one without 
which life would lose so much of its interest. These gifted 
writers of to-day and yesterday prove to us the truth of James 
Howell’s couplet: 
As keys do open chests 
So letters open breasts. 
It is not without good reason that letter-writing is called the 
“friendly craft” and “the gentlest art.”

A BOOK OF LETTERS 
I 
For many years, Helen Adams Keller (1880) has been a 
source of inspiration to American boys and girls. Almost all 
have read her Story of My Life. In spite of her handicaps, 
Helen Keller was graduated from Radcliffe in 1904, has written 
articles and books, and lectured throughout the United States. 
Her address is Forest Hills, Long Island. 
TO ST. NICHOLAS 
DEAR ST. NICHOLAS: 
Ir gives me very great pleasure to send you my autograph 
because I want the boys and girls who read St. Nicholas to 
know how blind children write. I suppose some of them won- 
der how we keep the lines so straight; so I will try to tell them 
how it is done. We have a grooved board which we put be- 
tween the pages when we wish to write. The parallel grooves 
correspond to lines and when we have pressed the paper into 
them by means of the blunt end of the pencil it is very easy 
to keep the words even. The small letters are all made in the 
grooves, while the long ones extend above and below them. We 
guide the pencil with the right hand, and feel carefully with 
the forefinger of the left hand to see that we shape and space 
the letters correctly. It is very difficult at first to form them 
plainly, but if we keep on trying it gradually becomes easier,

and after a great deal of practice we can write legible letters 
to our friends. Then we are very, very happy. Sometimes 
they may visit a school for the blind. If they do, I am sure they 
will wish to see the pupils write. 
Very sincerely your little friend,

Mark TWAIN or Samuel Langhorne Clemens (1835-1910) is 
usually associated with certain well-known stories, as Tom 
Sawyer, Huckleberry Finn and The Jumping Frog. He 
suggests to some readers more serious stories as Personal Re- 
collections of Joan of Arc. However,.he was a great letter- 
writter, too, and especially delighted in writing letters to 
children; no letter from a child went unanswered. He ap- 
preciated children’s opinions of his books as cordially as did 
Dickens and Stevenson. The following letters are typical of a 
large body of letters that Mark Twain wrote to very young 
people. 
1. TO MISS PICARD IN ST. DIE, FRANCE 
RIVERDALE-ON-THE-Hupson, February 22, 1902. 
DEAR Miss HELENE, 
Ir you will let me call you so, considering that my head is 
white and that I have grown-up daughters. Your beautiful 
letter has given me such deep pleasure! I will make bold to 
claim you for a friend and lock you ups with the rest of my 
riches; for I am a miser who counts his spoil every day and 
hoards it secretly and adds to it when he can, and is grateful 
to see it grow. 
Some of that gold comes, like yourself, in a sealed package,

and I can’t see it and may never have the happiness; but I 
know its value without that, and by what sum it increases my 
wealth, 
I have a Club, a private Club, which is all my own. I ap- 
point the Members myself, and they can’t help themselves, be- 
cause I don’t allow them to vote on their own appointment and 
I don’t allow them to resign! They are all friends whom I 
have never seen (save one), but who have written friendly let- 
ters to me. 
By the laws of ‘my Club there can be only one member in 
each country, and there can be no male Member but myself. 
Some day I may admit males, but I don’t know—they are ca- 
pricious and inharmonious, and their ways provoke me a great 
deal. It is a matter which the Club shall decide. 
I have made four appointments in the past three or four 
months: You as Member for France, a young Highland girl 
as Member for Scotland, a Mohammedan girl as Member for 
Bengal, and a dear and bright young niece of mine as Member 
for the United States—for I do not represent a country myself, 
but am merely Member at Large for the Human Race. 
You must not try to resign, for the laws of the Club do not 
allow that. You must console yourself by remembering that 
you are in the best of company; that nobody knows of your 
membership except myself—that no Member knows another’s 
name, but only her country; that no taxes are levied and no 
meetings held (but how dearly I should like to attend one!). 
One of my Members is a Princess of a royal house, another 
is the daughter of a village book-seller on the continent of 
Europe. For the only qualification for Membership is intel- 
lect and the spirit of good will; other distinctions, hereditary 
or acquired, do not count. 
May I send you the Constitution and Laws of the Club? I 
' shall be pleased if I may. It is a document which one of my 
daughters typewrites for me when I need one for a new Member,

and she would give her eyebrows to know what it is all about, 
but I strangle her curiosity by saying: “There are much 
cheaper typewriters than you are, my-dear, and if you try to 
pry into the sacred mysteries of this Club one of your pros- 
perities will perish sure.” 
My favorite? It is Joan of Arc. My next is Huckle- 
berry Finn, but the family’s next is The Prince and the 
Pauper. (Yes, you are right—I am a moralist in disguise; 
it gets me into heaps of trouble when I go thrashing around 
in political questions.) 
I wish you every good fortune and happiness and I thank you 
so much for your letter, 
Sincerely yours,

2. TO SUSY CLEMENS, IN BERLIN 
Susy Dear, 
I have been delighted to note your easy facility with your 
pen and proud to note also your literary superiorities of one 
kind and another—clearness of statement, directness, felicity of 
expression, photographic ability in setting forth an incident— 
style—good style—no barnacles on it in the way of un- 
necessary, retarding words (the shipman scrapes off the barn- 
acles when he wants his racer to go her best gait and straight 
to the buoy.) You should write a letter every day, long or 
short—and so ought I, but I don’t. 
Mamma says, tell Clara yes, she will have to write a note 
if the fan comes back mended. 
We could n’t go to Nice to-day—and had to ive: it up, on 
various accounts—and this was the last chance. I am sorry 
for Mamma—I wish she could have gone. She got a heavy 
fall yesterday evening and was pretty stiff and lame this morn- 
ing, but is working it off trunk packing.

3. TO MISS JOY AGNEW, IN LONDON 
‘TuxEDO Park, New York. 
Unto you greetings and salutation and worship, you dear, 
sweet little rightly-named Joy! I can see you now almost as 
vividly as I saw you that night when you sat flashing and 
beaming upon those sombre swallow-tails. 
“Fair as a star when only one 
Is shining in the sky.” 
Oh, you were indeed the only one—there wasn’t even the 
remotest chance of competition with you, dear! Ah, you are 
a decoration, you little witch! 
The idea of your house going to the wanton expense of a 
flower garden!—are n’t you enough? And what do you want 
to go and discourage the other flowers for? Is that the right 
spirit? is it considerate? is it kind? How do you suppose they 
feel when you come around—looking the way you look? And 
you so pink and sweet and dainty and lovely and supernatural ? 
Why, it makes them feel embarrassed and artificial, of course; 
and in my opinion it is just as pathetic as it can be. Now then 
you want to reform—dear—and do right. 
Well certainly you are well off, Joy:

cipled, affectionate, loyal dog who would n’t want any nobler 
service than the golden privilege of lying at your door, nights, 
and biting everything that came along—and I am that very 
one, and ready to come at the dropping of a hat. 
Do you think you could convey my love and thanks to your 
“daddy” and Owen Seaman and those other oppressed and 
down-trodden subjects of yours, you darling small tyrant? 
On my knees! These—with the kiss of fealty from your 
other subject—

Tue reader of letters often finds that the scientists are good 
letter-writers, probably because they are so interested in every- 
thing around them. William James (1842-1910), the psycholo- 
gist, excelled in letter-writing. His vocation was to teach 
psychology at Harvard University, and he was a fine influence 
among the students, stimulating them to think about important 
questions for themselves. James’ letters, which have been 
collected in two volumes, include many that he wrote to his 
children. Whatever concerned them was of interest to him.

and I marveled to see what an improvement had come over your 
handwriting in the short space of six weeks. “Orphly” and 
“ofly” are good ways to spell “awfully,” too. I went up a 
high mountain yesterday and saw all the kingdoms of the world 
spread out before me, on the illimitable prairie which looked 
like a map. The sky glowed and made the earth look like a 
stained-glass window. ‘The mountains are bright red. All the 
flowers and plants are different from those at home. ‘There is 
an immense mastiff in my house here. I think that even you 
would like him, he is so tender and gentle and mild, although 
fully as big as a calf. His ears and face are black, his eyes 
are yellow, his paws are magnificent, his tail keeps wagging 
all the time, and he makes on me the impression of an angel hid 
in a cloud. He longs to do good. 
I must now go and hear two other men lecture. Many kisses, 
also to Tweedy, from your ever loving,

DaRLING OLD CHERUBINI,— 
See how brave this girl and boy are in the Yosemite Valley !* 
I saw a moving sight the other morning before breakfast in a 
little hotel where I slept in the dusty fields. The young man 
of the house had shot a little wolf called a coyote in the early 
morning. The heroic little animal lay on the ground, with his 
big furry ears, and his clean white teeth, and his jolly cheerful 
little body, but his brave little life was gone. It made me think 
how brave all these living things are. Here little coyote was, 
without any clothes or house or books or anything, with nothing

but his naked self to pay his way with, and risking his life 
so cheerfully—and losing it—just to see if he could pick up a 
meal near the hotel. He was doing his coyote-business like a 
hero, and you must do your boy-business, and I my man- 
business bravely too, or else we won’t be worth as much as that 
little coyote. Your mother can find a picture of him in those 
green books of animals, and I want you to copy it. Your

DEAR FRANCOIS,— 
Here we are in Geneva, at the Flournoys’—dear people 
and splendid children. I wish Harry could marry Alice, Billy 
marry Marguerite, and you marry Ariane-Dorothée—the ab- 
solutely jolliest and beautifullest 3-year old I ever saw. I am 
trying to get you engaged! I enclose pictures of the dog. 
Ariane-Dorothée r-r-r-olls her r-r-r’s like fury. I got your 
picture of the elephant—very good. Draw everything you see, 
no matter how badly, trying to notice how the lines run—one 
line every day!—just notice it and draw it, no matter how 
badly, and at the end of the year you ’ll be s’prised to see how 
well you can draw. ‘Tell Billy to get you a big blank book at 
the Codp., and every day take one page, just drawing down on 
it some thing, or dog, or horse, or man or woman, or part of a 
man or woman, which you have looked at that day just for the 
purpose, to see how the lines run. I bet the last page of that 
book will be better than the first! Do this for my sake. Kiss 
your dear old Grandma. P’r’aps, we shall get home this sum- 
mer after all. In two or three days I shall see a doctor and 
know more about myself. Will let you know. Keep motionless

4. TO HIS DAUGHTER 
VILLA LUISE 
Bap-NAUHEIM, May 26, 1900. 
DARLING PEG,— 
Your letter came last night and explained sufficiently the 
cause of your long silence. You have evidently been in a bad 
state of spirits again, and dissatisfied with your environment; 
and I judge that you have been still more dissatisfied with the 
inner state of trying to consume your own smoke, and grin and 
bear it, so as to carry out your mother’s behests made after 
the time when you scared us so by your inexplicable tragic out- 
cries in those earlier letters. Well! I believe you have been 
trying to do-the manly thing under difficult circumstances, but 
one learns only gradually to do the best thing; and the best thing 
for you would be to write at least weekly, if only a postcard, 
and say just how things are going. If you are in bad spirits, 
there is no harm whatever in communicating that fact, and de- 
fining the character of it, or describing.it as exactly as you like. 
The bad thing is to pour out the contents of one’s bad_spirits 
on others and leave them with it, as it were, on their hands, as 
if it was for them to do something about it. That was what 
you did in your other letter which alarmed us so, for your 
shrieks of anguish were so excessive, and so imexplained by any- 
thing you told us in the way of facts, that we did n’t know but 
what you had suddenly gone crazy. ‘That is the worst sort of 
11
-P-A-G-E-32
  A BOOK OF LETTERS 
thing you can do. The middle sort of thing is what you do 
this time—namely, keep silent for more than a fortnight, and 
when you do write, still write rather mysteriously si te: your 
sorrows, not being quite open enough. 
Now, my dear little girl, you have come to an age siti the 
inward life develops and when some people (and on the whole 
those who have most of a destiny) find that all is not a bed of 
roses. Among other things there will be waves of terrible sad- 
ness, which last sometimes for days; and dissatisfaction with 
one’s self, and irritation at others, and anger at circumstances 
and stony insensibility, etc., etc., which taken together form a 
melancholy. Now, painful as it is, this is sent to us for an en- 
lightenment. It always passes off, and we learn about life from 
it, and we ought to learn a great many good things if we react on 
it rightly. [From margin.] (For instance, you learn how good 
a thing your home is, and your country, and your brothers, and 
you may learn to be more considerate of other people, who, you 
now learn, may have their inner weaknesses and sufferings, 
too.) Many persons take a kind of sickly delight in hug- 
ging it; and some sentimental ones may even be proud of 
it, as showing a fine sorrowful kind of sensibility. Such 
persons make a regular habit of the luxury of woe. That 
is the worst possible reaction on it. It is usually a sort of 
disease, when we get it strong, arising from the organism 
having generated some poison in the blood; and we must n’t 
submit to it an hour longer than we can help, but jump at 
every chance to attend to anything cheerful or comic or take 
part in anything active that will divert us from our mean, 
pining inward state of being. When it passes off, as I said, 
we know more than we did before. And we must try to make 
it last as short a time as possible. The worst of it often is that, 
while we are in it, we don’t want to get out of it. We hate it, 
and yet we prefer staying in it—that is a part of the disease. 
If we find ourselves like that, we must make ourselves do some- 
12
-P-A-G-E-33
AMERICAN LETTER-WRITERS 
thing different, go with people, speak cheerfully, set ourselves 
to some hard work, make ourselves sweat, etc.; and that is the 
good way of reacting that makes of us a valuable character. 
The disease makes you think of yourself all the time; and the 
way out of it is to keep as busy as we can thinking of things and 
of other people—no matter what’s the matter with our self. 
I have no doubt you are doing as well as you know how, dar- 
ling little Peg; but we have to learn everything, and I also have 
no doubt that you ‘ll manage it better and better if you ever 
have any more of it, and soon it will fade away, simply leaving 
you with more experience. The great thing for you now, I 
should suppose, would be to enter as friendlily as possible into 
the interest of the Clarke children. If you like them, cr acted 
as if you liked them, you need n’t trouble about the question of 
whether they like you or not. They probably will, fast enough; 
and if they don’t, it will be their funeral, not yours. But this 
is a great lecture, so I will stop. The great thing about it is 
that itis all true. 
“~The baths are threatening to disagree with me again, so I 
may stop them soon. Will let you know as quick as anything 
is decided. Good news from home: the Merrimans have taken 
the Irving Street house for another year, and the Wambaughs 
(of the Law School) have taken Chocorua, though at a reduced 
rent. The weather here is almost continuously cold and sun- 
less. Your mother is sleeping, and will doubtless add a word 
to this when she wakes. Keep a merry heart—‘“‘time and the 
hour run through the roughest day’—and believe me ever your

ever writ, and the address on the envelope so well written 
that I wondered whose hand it was, and never thought it might 
be yours. Your tooth also was a precious memorial—I hope 
you'll get a better one in its place. Send me the other as soon

If any of George Washington’s baby-teeth had been kept till 
now, they would be put somewhere in a public museum, for

Museum. When Washington was only eight years old his 
mother did n’t know he was going to be Washington. But he 
did be it, when the time came. 
I will now tell you about what Dr. Hildreth is doing. The 
family is in Florida, and he is building himself a new house. 
They are just starting the foundation. The fence is taken down 
between our yard and his, by the stable, and teams are driving 
through with lumber. Our back yard is filled with lumber for 
the frame of the house. It is to be cut, squared, mortised, etc., 
in our yard and then carried through to his. 
I dined last night at the Dibblees’. The boys had been to 
dancing-school. I like their looks. All the boys and girls to- 
gether kept up such a talking that I seemed to be in a boiler 
factory where they bang the iron with the hammers so. It’s 
just so with them every day. But they ’re very good-natured, 
even if they don’t let the old ones speak.

ALAN SEEGER (1888-1916) fell gloriously on the fourth of 
July, in the charge at Belloy-en-Santerre. He wrote letters to 
his mother and friends about his experiences in the World War. 
The following letter shows that he appreciated beauty and could 
see it, even in the midst of the sordidness and ugliness of war. 
He is the author of J Have a Rendezvous with Death.

May 23, 1916. 
We are just back after six days in first line. We are lodged 
in a big quarry in the woods. It is rather cold and damp in- 
side, but extremely picturesque—immense subterranean gal- 
leries, four-square, cut in the solid rock, pitch black inside with 
here and there little points of light where the men stick their 
candles. 
The week in first line was very pleasant. The weather was 
superb and I was never bored an instant, neither in the beauti- 
ful days when the unclouded sunlight came filtering through 
the branches of the forest, nor in the starry nights that at this

time of year fade even before two o’clock into the wonder of the 
spring dawn. Nothing more adorable in Nature than this day- 
break in the northeast in May and June. One hears the cock- 
crows in the villages of that mysterious land behind the German 
lines. ‘Then the cuckoos begin to call in the green valleys and 
all at once, almost simultaneously, all the birds of the forest 
begin to sing. ‘The cannon may roar, and the rifles crackle, but 
Nature’s program goes on just the same. 
The likelihood of a big action in the near future is vanishing 
more and more. ‘The general opinion is that Verdun has not 
only mangé beaucoup de monde but what is more important, 
beaucoup de munitions. As the French seem in counter- 
attacks to be making serious efforts and even on a large scale to 
regain some of the lost ground, I do not expect anything on 
other parts of the front for some time to come, unless it be the 
English. If it turn out that we have actually retaken Dou- 
aumont, it will be a magnificent achievement. I shall ask 
permission to go out and leave the newspapers on the German 
barbed wire. I have already made several patrols here and 
know the ground. 3

Jack Morris Wricut (1898-1918), “a poet of the air,” was 
a student at Andover College. He saw volunteer service in 
France before volunteering in the United States air service. He 
was commissioned first lieutenant in December, 1917, and was 
killed in a training accident in January, 1918. Like Alan 
Seeger, he had lived and studied in Paris before the great op- 
portunity to serve came. His letters appeared first in Har- 
per’s, entitled A Poet of the Air, and attracted the attention of 
a wide circle of readers.

TO HIS MOTHER 
January 19, 1918. 
My Dearest MoMMIz, 
I have just received my active orders. I can wear all the 
paraphernalia, silver bars, gold-and-black hat-cord, black 
braids, gold silk braids, collar decorations, and also the gold 
aviation eagle on my heart. 
Oh yes! I’ve had my first salute—a beauty, just the wav 
these privates ought to!!! I, who in the French army as poilu 
covered with dust on a banging truck, and in the American army 
was a blinking, gawking doorkeeper, jumping up and down to 
attention for second lieutenants and being kicked from the first 
to the fifth fight by thousands of corporals, I am now ye hon- 
orable and much-respected, much-waited-upon First Lieutenant 
and pilot. Ill have to grow a beard, too, for I look like a 
baby. 
One private guessed immediately that I had just put on my 
stripes, probably because I had been moving a garbage can with 
him half an hour previous, and as he saluted a broad grin 
spread across his tough cheeks—it was beautifully sincere and 
I couldn’t help laughing. 
All the boys, as I walk down the barracks, wish me good 
luck, stand at attention, and then jump on me and muss me all 
up. ‘Confound these lower creatures. I must move im- 
mediately to the officers’ barracks. 
‘The next thing to do, now that I’m a gentleman again for the 
first time in many months, was to go and have tea. Imagine 
having tea, but such is the gentle and civilized custom of the 
officers; so off I went to the Biltmore—which is the Red Cross. 
Now the Red Cross is divided distinctly in two. In front of 
the counter a long line of soldiers and cadets wait to buy a tin

cup of coffee and a sandwich, to the worn-out needle of a phono- 
graph. Behind the counter, laughing as easy life permits, sit 
the favorite privileged few—the officers sipping chocolate, dip- 
ping into choice confitures, and being waited on with china- 
ware—that they do not wash afterward, either—at a few long 
white tables surrounded by a whirligig of white-and-blue nurses. 
The tea was just exquisite—a couple of friends, newly com- 
missioned, were with me. It was the first time we had been 
clean in two months, so we felt as in tuxedos and were 
immediately very affected in voice, awkward in gesture, and 
insipid in conversation—fluent chat, such as officers—the higher 
wits—always are supposed to be keeping up among their in- 
tellectual circles. ‘Then, oh, wonderful sight of brilliant chan- 
deliers and glistening tables of feasting, I walked over to the 
officers’ mess, much embarrassed and wondering why I wasn’t 
banging my good old mess-kit in a line unending, such as I had 
always done for the last nine months. Decidedly I had been en- 
throned, blessed by God, sought by fortune, transported, for 
some vague but important merits, high into the celestial on the 
kind wings of smiling, suddenly visible angels from heaven— 
that is, Headquarters. 
I ate on china: I ate a feast and I ate without the forecast 
of standing in another line out in the cold night to wash a greasy 
tin dish in cold water and freeze my hands all the way back 
home to the barracks. The sergeants of the mess addressed me, 
“Sir.” The privates stood silently at attention, daring not to 
utter so much as the title “Sir” lest it disturb my tranquillity of 
thought. 
The next morning I was awakened by the rush of my friends 
to stand at roll-call at 5:30 a.m. I grunted and rolled over to 
doze off another hour or two. Then I proceeded to dress, re- 
ceived the compliments of the morning from the sergeant who, 
the night before, had had me working on hands and knees all 
over the barracks floor, and when he asked me if I would leave 
18

everything straight in the bunk when I left for the officers’ bar- 
racks, I merely remarked, “I’m not living here any more.” 
Then I brought my baggage over, after a luxurious breakfast, 
to the new barracks, where an orderly opened the door for me 
as I entered. At noon a chicken dinner with a fine dessert 
awaited me, and I sat opposite the next room, where I could 
watch with a broad grin the boys I had left standing in the 
winding, serpentine, sleepy line to receive their Sunday beans. 
Just heard of a witty trick done recently by a friend. He was 
doing acrobatics when he went into a vrille. That’s very bad 
near the ground if it happens accidently; he came out but to 
go into another—the ground coming up like lightning—when 
he kept his calm enough to notice an aileron flapping, useless, 
and traced the break back to a missing bolt, whereupon he-— 
marvelous brain, he must have divine control—undid his belt 
and stood up a little, full in the dash of a death-spin, a sure, 
fatal fall, grabbed the disjointed piece, and held it together with 
one hand over his head while with the other he made his land- 
ing safely. 
He is a hero whom not only the papers ignore, but most of 
the camp. He has the compliments of us aviators, and I can 
assure you that means something. 
Great joy! ‘To-morrow morning I enter spirals; that will 
be the beginning of more rapidly succeeding and more vital

Dolittle. This Doctor Dolittle has, “besides the gold-fish in the 
pond at the bottom of his garden, rabbits in the pantry, white 
mice in his piano, a squirrel in the linen closet, and a hedgehog

children of New York City at the request of Mr. C. G. Leland, 
who is in charge of the school libraries. 
TO: THE CHILDREN OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS OF 
THE CITY OF NEW YORK 
My Dear READERS: 
Mr. Leland has asked me to write and tell you something 
about myself. Now everybody likes to talk about himself; but 
those who do are usually rather tiresome people—once they get 
started you can never stop them. So I have been wondering, 
out of all the things I could tell you of myself, which are 
those that would interest you—because I must n’t make this let- 
ter too long. And I think I will tell you about my museum. 
Well, when I was eight years old I kept a Natural History 
Museum in my mother’s linen closet. It was probably the only 
museum of its kind in the world. It had birds’ nests and sea- 
shells and fossils and pressed leaves and skulls of cows and 
dogs and the things that a regular museum does have. Of 
course it did not have as many things as the regular ones have; 
but it had just as many departments. 
Then, too, some of the exhibits were a little doubtful. I 
mean. by that there were pieces of flint for instance, that might 
have been Indian arrow-heads at some time, or Early Britons’ 
battle-axes. And there were pieces of bone that could have 
been ribs from a dinosaur. However, on the description-cards 
of all those exhibits that I wasn’t sure about I would put a 
question-mark after the title—like this: 
20

PREHISTORIC FRYING-PAN(?) 
(DISCOVERED IN THE JONES’S 
BACK YARD) 
VERY SCARCE. PROBABLY MADE 
OF GOLD (??) 
  Two question-marks meant that the information was es- 
pecially doubtful. ) 
Now, you know, all natural history museums have some one 
department particularly good. ‘They don’t mean to specialize; 
but it just happens that way. The New York Museum is fa- 
mous for its collection of minerals, for instance—while the 
South Kensington Museum in London was at one time par- 
ticularly proud of its Tropical Birds. My museum specialized 
in Natural Curiosities. Anything that was odd; queerly shaped 
stones; roots that looked like old men’s faces; sticks, so worm- 
eaten that they looked like Chinese carving; anything that mys- 
tified me or seemed as though it should have a history to it— 
such treasures were kept in a special case in my museum. And 
my imagination had a perfectly wonderful time spinning yarns 
over all the strange adventures these objects might have gone 
through. 
On the door of the linen-closet there was a sign that read: 
“THE MUSEUM IS OPEN TO THE PUBLIC ON WEEK- 
DAYS FROM 9 a.m. TILL 5 p.m. AND ON SUNDAYS 
FROM 11 a.m. TILL 5 p.m.” You see I didn’t get up so 
early on Sundays. The public did n’t come in very large num- 
bers—mostly my brothers, our cat, and our dog. And when 
they had seen the museum every day for a week, I could n’t per- 
suade them to come any more. So after that, whenever I wanted 
21 
 
-P-A-G-E-42
  A BOOK OF LETTERS 
to play “Museum” I had to pay the public to visit the show. 
I usually paid them with marbles or lollipops. I was a very 
public-spirited Museum Director. 
And not only was I the Director; I was the Chairman, the 
Curator and the whole staff of Naturalists. The thing I most 
enjoyed in the business was collecting the specimens for the 
museum. One day I’d be ornithologist and would go round 
the countryside, cutting down last year’s birds’ nests together 
with the piece of tree or bush they were built on. Other days 
I ’d be a geologist, collecting fossils and different kinds of rocks. 
And sometimes a botanist, hunting flower and leaf specimens. 
And every Saturday night I was an astronomer, looking for 
falling-stars through my father’s opera-glasses. (I saw quite 
a number fall, but I never found where they fell—and conse- 
quently my museum was somewhat short on meteorites.) 
But if the public were not very keen on visiting my museum, 
the rats and mice were. They thought my museum was a lovely 
place. They liked my collection so well, they even took parts 
of it away with them. For instance, they took the old birds’ 
nests—to make over into new ones for themselves. And that 
was what gave me the idea for the Doctor Dolittle stories called 
The Museum Mouse and The Rat-and-Mouse Club, which 
I am some day going to write for you. Of course the rats and 
the mice didn’t come to the Museum in the regular visiting- 
hours, from 9 to 5: they came in the middle of the night. 
Well, when my parents found out that my museum in the 
linen-closet was so popular with the rats and mice, they decided 
that it ought to be closed to the public for the spring—for the 
spring-cleaning in fact. And when they discovered to what ex- 
tent the rats and mice had made themselves at home in the 
Ornithological Department, they refused to allow the museum 
to be re-opened in their house any more. 
One of the stories that my mother tells about this period of 
22
-P-A-G-E-43
  AMERICAN LETTER-WRITERS 
my career as a naturalist is that I used to bring home the old 
skulls of dogs and cats that I found under the hedges and boil 
them, to get them clean and white for my museum, in her best 
saucepan! It isn’t true. I used her second-best one. It was 
bigger. 
So that was the end of my Private Natural History Museum. 
It was never re-opened to the public (although I had already 
laid the foundation stone with great ceremony at the bottom of 
the garden for a brand new building), because that summer 
I went away to boarding-school. But I often look back upon it 
with pride. It was certainly the only museum of its kind in the 
world. | 
Well, dear readers, for one letter, I think I have talked enough 
about myself. I had better stop now—before Mr. Leland stops 
me. 
I hope you will all enjoy a very MERRY CHRISTMAS, and 
in the New Year get everything your hearts desire. 
I remain 
Yours very sincerely,

My Dear FRANKIE, 
It is a long time since we have seen each other, and I so fear 
that our friendship may grow cold through absence and silence. 
I think that we ought to exchange letters. 
A letter is not so good as a talk, but it is better than nothing 
at all. The best way to write a letter is to do it almost as if 
you were talking. 
I have made a little story of the things that I have been do- 
ing and sent it to you on a separate sheet. Now I wish you to 
tell me what has happened to you, and whether you have grown 
in mind as well as in body. 
Tell me what was the happiest day that you have had since 
we went to the picnic together last June—do you remember? 
Tell me which book you like best of all that you have read, and 
why you like it. Tell me whether you have made any new 
friends, and why you have chosen them. ‘Tell me whether any 
of your studies are too hard for you, and what you are going 
to do about it. Tell me whether you think that your town where 
you live is improving, and whether you think that you can do 
anything to help it. Tell me what you wish to be when you 
grow up. 
Write to me as simply as if we were sitting side by side on 
a log beside a little river. 
Faithfully your friend,

DEAR GIRLS AND Boys, 
So many letters come to me every week from all parts of the 
country that it has grown impossible for me to send personal 
replies; and I am obliged to send a printed slip which answers 
the questions most frequently asked. 
But there is one question which is asked nine times out of 
ten that it does not answer. ‘That is about the royal road to 
authorship. Most of my young correspondents seem to think - 
that there is such a road; and that they have only to have it 
pointed out to them to be able to follow it blithely. Nearly 
everybody thinks that if he only had time, and conditions were 
favorable, he could write a better book than the majority of © 
those published. 
It is to save you from the disappointments that would follow 
were you to try to rush into print that I quote what the old 
Colonel said to Betty in The Little Colonel’s Knight Comes 
Riding: . 
“Your writing shows unusual promise. Its only lack is the 
lack of nearly all young writers;—a knowledge of life. You 
must know more of the world before you can have a message

that will make it stop and listen. You must live and grow and 
have experiences. You are like Shapur now, a vendor of salt, 
who as yet can only follow in the train of others, writing only 
what has already been written. . You have n’t the wares with 
which to gain a royal entrance into the City of your Desire. 
You need some Desert of Waiting in which to learn the secret 
of Omar’s alchemy. Your writing lacks the attar which gained 
him his royal entrance. And no man_ fills his crystal vase 
with—it—until he has first been pricked by the world’s disap- 
“So patience, all my little would- be authors. Peudces surely 
comes to him who is willing to face such a desert of waiting, - 
and to serve long and careful spree 
With all good wishes for that succes§, 
Very sincerely yours,

TO HIS SON GEORGE 
QuEBEC, Monday Evening. (1874) 
DEAR GEORGE: 
I want you to read this letter all yourself and not have any- 
body spell out a word for you. But if you do have to get Ruly 
to help you with it a little you must read it over till you 
know it all. I said I would write to you from Montreal, but we 
_ saw nothing there that small boys would care much about. But 
here in Quebec are lots of things which would please you very 
‘much. The City is very old and is built on a high and rocky 
hill, up which the road is so steep that Robin could hardly drag 
our wagon to the top, but the tough little horses that they have 
here, not half as large as he is, tug away at loads much bigger 
and seem to draw them up with ease. ‘The wagons too are very 
funny here. They call them Calashes (you may get May to 
tell you what that word is). They are like a chaise with two 
wheels and a little seat or perch for the man who drives on the 
edge of the dasher. How he holds on there it is hard to tell, 
but he does somehow, and drives like lightning, and the two 
poor riders inside are shaken all to pieces. The money is gold, 
silver and copper, and they will not take our pennies at all, not 
even for candy, because they are not large enough. ‘Those they 
do use are sometimes very odd and queer. Here are two for 
you—one as you will see has a dried cod fish on one side and 
a plough on the other. The other has two horses and a lamb. I 
will bring home some more queer ones for you and Ruly. 
To-day Mama and I went to see some real Indians who live 
at a place nine miles from here. The Chief was at home, and 
showed us all the things his people made and then, when he 
heard we were from New York, he brought out his tomahawk, 
and his scalping knife, and put on his war hat full of painted 
27
-P-A-G-E-48

feathers, and took hold of Mama (in fun you know) and asked 
her if she was not afraid. She said ‘Not a bit,’ and laughed 
and he laughed too. Like old King Cole he seemed to be a very 
jolly old soul. The Indian boys all have real bows and arrows, 
and cry out to the people who go by, ‘Shoot, shoot pennies, 
pennies!’ and if you throw them some they set them up in the 
ground and shoot at them, and the boy who hits a penny with 
his arrow wins it and keeps it for his own. 
All around Quebec is a great wall built of solid stone, twice 
as high as papa’s head, and so broad that if you were to lie on 
the top of it, you could hardly stretch your arms across. The 
English built it at great cost, to defend the City in case of War, 
but now one of our gunboats would knock it all down in a 
day. I will tell you more when I get home, if I hear that you 
have been a good boy.

THERE is scarcely a literate person in the country who can- 
not quote at least a few lines of the poetry of Henry Wadsworth 
Longfellow (1807-1882). The picture of his kindly face with 
a halo of white hair is instantly recognized. Longfellow lived 
at Cambridge in a house of colonial design and taught literature 
at Harvard University. The little girls to whom he wrote 
letters were also the subject of his poetry occasionally: “Alice, 
and laughing Allegra and Edith with golden hair.”

school all the week, and got only seven marks. I shall have a 
billet on Monday. I wish you to buy.me a drum. 
HENRY W. LONGFELLOW 
(THE FATHER’S REPLY) 
I have found a very pretty drum, with an eagle painted on 
it, but the man asks two dollars for it; and they do not let any 
vessels go from Boston to Portland now. But if I can find any 
opportunity to send it down I shall buy it. And if I cannot, 
I shall buy something else which will please you as well. I 
am glad to hear that you have been a good boy at school and are 
likely to get a billet. You must save all your billets till I 
get home. . . . If I can get time I shall write you and Stephen 
another letter, and tell you about the State House, and the 
theatre, and other things that are in Boston. 
2. TO EMILY A—— 
NAHANT, August 18, 1859. 
Your letter followed me down here by the seaside, where I 
am passing the summer with my three little girls. The oldest 
is about your age; but as little girls’ ages keep changing every 
year, I can never remember exactly how old she is, and have 
to ask her mamma, who has a better memory than I have. 
Her name is Alice; I never forget that. She is a nice girl, and 
loves poetry almost as much as you do. 
The second is Edith, with blue eyes and beautiful golden 
locks which I sometimes call her ‘‘nankeen hair,” to make her 
laugh. She is a very busy little woman, and wears gray boots. 
The youngest is Allegra; which, you know, means merry; 
and she is the merriest little thing you ever saw,—always sing- 
ing and laughing all over the house.

These are my three little girls, and Mr. Read has painted

They bathe in the sea, and dig in the sand, and patter about 
the piazza all day long, and sometimes go to see the Indians en- 
camped on the shore, and buy baskets and bows and arrows. 
I do not say anything about the two boys. They are such 
noisy fellows it is of no use to talk about them. 
And now, dear Miss Emily, give my love to your papa, and 
good-night, with a kiss, from his friend and yours. 
3. TO FLORENCE A—— 
I have put off answering your nice little note from day to 
day; but, as you see, I have not forgotten it. I have been 
hoping all along that some lines of poetry, such as you ask for, 
would come into my mind. But they would not, and so I have 
to write you in prose, not to keep you waiting any longer. 
If you will ask your papa, who knows all about it, he will tell 
- you that good poems do not always come to one’s mind when 
wanted. Verses, yes, one can write those at any time; but real 
poetry—that is another matter. I think good prose is better 
than bad verse. I do not say bad poetry, because when it is 
bad, it is no longer poetry. 
And so I send you this little note instead of a little song; and 
with it good wishes for your birthday, and kind remembrances 
for your father.

living and growing thing. Perhaps even more she loved the sea 
in all its moods, the sands and shells of its shore, and the fresh 
salt winds. This love found its expression in her poems, some 
of which are written especially for children. The Little Sand-

Would you like, some day when you have a little time, to

and gather me some harebell seeds? If you could and would, 
I should be so very glad, for I want to get the dear lovely 
bells to grow here by our river as well as by yours, and I am 
afraid the roots I brought all the way from Newburyport and 
set out here, will not live. If I had some seeds I would plant 
them this fall and I think they ’d come up in the spring.

How I should like to see you all. We have got a dear little

the way from the Rocky Mountains to Massachusetts in an 
ambulance across the plains when he was five months old, in 
August. One night there was a dreadful storm (they had to 
make a tent-house for themselves every night), and the rain 
and wind were so frightful they tore down the tent-house, and 
drenched all their clothes, and all their beds, and everything 
they had, and then they were exposed to the merciless storm 
till morning, not a dry rag to put on, or a dry place to put 
baby, and the big hailstones beating them till he cried with the 
pain of them. Wasn’t that cruel? Think of liftle Anson

exposed to such a dreadful storm! But it was _ beautiful,

such lovely flowers, verbenas, petunias, gladiolus, mats of crim- 
son and scarlet portulaca, and all sorts of lovely garden flowers 
growing wild and wonderful kinds of cactus, etc. But poor 
little Richard and May like wooden houses better than tents, 
and living here with their little cousins better than being 
rattled along by the trains of mules and troops of men, day after 
day, through the sunshine and rain. Kiss dear baby for me,

Gamma and papa and the boys, and do write to me, Nan

You know, my dear Anson, how much hasty-pudding must

than one, by the mother of a family. \So, I hope you ’ll be 
charitable, for I’ve been loving you just as much all the time 
as if I had written a volume. Well, how do you do, this 
beautiful weather, you dear thing? Isn’t it beautiful to have — 
real hot summer days at last? How are all the gold robins and 
sparrows and catbirds and chickadees and woodpeckers and 
bluebirds and blackbirds and kingbirds and humming-birds 
and things? Has the gold robin hatched her brood? Did she 
take the black horsehair after all? Don’t you think, we had a 
wind that was like a hurricane of the desert, the other day, 
hot and strong and long. A little chipping-sparrow had built 
her dainty nest in the cherry-tree outside my western chamber 
window, within reach of my hand, and as I sat there sewing I

could watch her going and coming, and it was more lovely than 
tongue can tell. Well, this preposterous gale blew and blew 
and blew till the cows came home, and blew all night besides, 
as if its only earthly aim and object was to destroy every living 
thing in its way. It blew the dear little nest with its pretty 
blue eggs clean away out of sight;-we found the remains in the 
hedge next day. And a dear purple finch’s nest and eggs 
shared the same fate; the finches had built in a little cedar by 
the fence. I was so sorry! Lots of nests were blown away all 
about. I hope gold robin held fast to the elm tree down at 
Gammer’s, if that senseless wind went roaring and raving down 
to Newburyport, as I suppose it did. Did the yellow bird 
build in the currant bushes? I’m so anxious to know! When 
I went over to Amesbury that day I left you, a ruby throated 
humming-bird was fluttering among Mr. Whittier’s pear-trees 
all day. I wondered if he were the same one you and mamma 
and I watched that heavenly afternoon before, when we sat by 
the pleasant open window with the daffys underneath and the 
birds going and coming. Oh! I must tell you, that the chip- 
sparrow whose nest blew away built again in an elm-tree the 
other side of the house. Mr. Thaxter and Lony have been gone 
three days, and I milk the cow and she is tied to an apple-tree 
and what do you think she does? She’s as frisky as a kitten, 
so all the time I’m milking, she goes round and round the tree 
and I after her, and it’s a spectacle enough to kill the cats, it’s 
so ridiculous. I suppose Margie is at the Mills by this time, 
and what good times you must have with the children! I gave 
lovely “‘little black Gammer” to Margie to carry back to your 
dearest of mammas. I hope she got it safely. Please tell her 
how much obliged to her I am. Tell her I have just got 
through wrestling with the dragon of house-cleaning and have 
succeeded in felling him to the earth, whereat my soul rejoices 
with an exceeding great joy. You can also inform her privately 
that I love her to distraction.

My DARLING CHILDREN, 
If thinking of you does any good you have had a comfortable 
time of it for papa and mamma carry you with them all the 
time, and there is a great deal of time to think of nice good 
children, I assure you. Our last recognition was of dear Phil 
and Berty’s faces. For the faces grew smaller and smaller, at 
last the eyes and noses died out of them and they became little 
white rounds in the sea of the black clothes of the people. So 
I could not distinguish the faces of the taller children, but 
Phil and Berty quite below the line of the others were dis- 
tinguished to the very last. So it is sometimes well to be small- 
est of all, and that, dear Berty, will make up a little for being 
helped the very last of all at dinner.

Till this morning we have had almost all sail set, which is very 
unusual, and means, of course, that the wind has been nearly 
fair all the time. Four days bring you past the banks of New- 
foundland. ‘Three days may be fairly called the English part 
of the passage,—then we see Fastnet Light to-night, if all is 
well, and do not reach Liverpool until Saturday morning. 
You will observe that three more days are left in the middle of 
the Atlantic itself. To this portion of the globe the sailors 
give the happy title of the Devil’s Hole, and I am sure it is very 
well named. At least we found very rough weather there, and 
were all pretty sick till it got through, having started on our 
first four days with the idea that we were to be let off very 
easily.

Perhaps they will need help from Nelly. They must do it the 
very day it arrives, better the very hour, or they may never do 
it at all. If Arthur cares to look in the lower drawers of Miss 
Tallant’s secretary, I think he will find a chart made by me 
some thirty-odd years ago in which I entered some of the 
earlier steam passages. This would be a good map to enter 
this on. Perhaps he would like to copy that, without the old 
tracks. Or he may enter it on the Mercator’s projection in 
Fay’s Atlas,—Fay’s is the rather new one. 
The proposal is that we shall all sit up to-night to ten o’clock 
to see the Fastnet Light. ‘This is the first light house in Ire- 
land, not a very great way south of the Skelligs which are 
sometimes seen on this voyage. ‘To-morrow morning early we 
expect to stop at Queenstown and leave the mails, and such 
passengers as there disembark. ‘The detention is not half an 
hour, and then we proceed up the Irish Channel to Liverpool,

shall write from there so I will not go into further plans here. 
But I shall at once write to Aunt Susy pressing her to join us at 
the Isle of Wight, where we shall spend a few days before we 
go to London. 
I shall try to write a line to Aunt Lucretia and Uncle 
Charles, but you may send them this note, as you may all my 
other letters that seem of importance enough. Of course mere 
directions for your own guidance need not be sent to them. 
We shall begin to hear from you on Monday, and that will be

LIVERPOOL, May 5, 1873. 
Dear PHIL AND BeErtTy: 
This seems a very good country for boys, but I have seen 
no boys I like near so well as mine. We went on Saturday 
to a Museum which is like the Natural History rooms only a 
great deal bigger. We saw there a live chameleon. Now the 
chameleon is the beast who is one color at one time and another 
at another. He is not very big, about as long as Phil’s hand. 
When we saw him he was walking up a little bush and he was 
a greenish yellow. He had cabbage to eat. ‘There were splen- 
did peacocks and pheasants. When you go to the Natural 
History Society, I hope you will look for an Argus pheasant. 
He is called Argus because there was a king Argus who had 
one hundred eyes. Now this bird’s tail is so full of beautiful 
spots that look like eyes that he is called the Argus pheasant. 
Is not that a good name?

Then there were live fishes swimming among grass and 
stones in glass boxes so that we could see them. There were 
very, very old mummies from the tombs in Egypt. I laughed 
very much at some tortoises who were not alive but looked very 
funny. ‘The people wanted to show their breasts, so they set 
them up in the cases with the breasts in front, and they looked 
as if they were jumping Jim Crow. Arthur will show you 
how to jump Jim Crow and perhaps will teach you how. Here 
is a tortoise jumping Jim Crow (picture). As we approached 
the land after our voyage we saw a very famous light house, 
at a place called Holy-head. MHoly-head is a cliff, or rocky 
mountain of which the sides run down into the sea. At the 
very end of the cliff is a little island and on this island is the 
light house all alone. ‘There is a little bridge which crosses 
to the island. But when they carry oil and food to the light 
house, they do not carry them by the bridge, but in boats. And 
these boats sail into a deep cave under the light house. Then 
the people look down through a well into the cave, and lower 
down ropes and pull up the oil and food. Is not that a good 
way? All around the light house are ever so many gulls’ 
nests, and the gulls lay their eggs there, and there the little 
birds are born. And no one is permitted to land or to med- 
dle with the gulls’ eggs at all, so they are not frightened. Why 
do you think they take such care of them? It is because they 
scream so and make so much noise that in the fog when sailors 
cannot see the light they can hear the gulls screaming and can 
keep away from the rocks. Is not that a good way? 
Now we are going to Chester, a very old city where you do 
not have to carry umbrellas, because the side walks have 
covers over them. Is not that a good way? 
Mamma sends love and kisses to you all.

SusAN HALE (1833-1910) was a brilliant woman, a sympa- 
thetic friend, and an observant traveller. Young people liked to 
gather on her piazza at Matunuck, Rhode Island, and hear her 
talk about travel and books and especially botany and as- 
tronomy. As a girl in Brookline and a woman in Boston 
society, she was noted for her individuality and brilliancy. The 
following letter gives a good idea of what schools in Brookline 
and Boston were like seventy-five years ago. 
TO ALEXANDER HALE 
Sunday evening, October 14, 1849. 
DEAR ELty,—I am now fairly launched on the sea of ed- 
ucation, or school. I go daily from nine till two. You may 
be interested in knowing my course of study. In the first place, 
I write an abstract every Sunday of the sermon of Sunday 
morning. ‘This is for Monday morning’s lesson. At school 
I learn a lesson from ‘“‘Viri Romae” and recite in Colburn’s 
‘Mental Arithmetic.” I don’t study the lessons in this latter 
branch, but we are supposed to know it by intuition, and every 
day are plied with it by Mr. Emerson. We get up and down 
in this class. I vary, being sometimes within three of the 
head, occasionally, though rarely, equally near the foot, of the 
class. We learn an evening lesson in zodlogy for every day 
but Monday and Saturday. The book is Agassiz and Gould’s 
“Zoology” and treats of diverse subjects referring to the animal 
kingdom—such as the vertebrate animals, mollusks, mammals, 
etc., and if you were here I could logically expound to you 
that man, as well as many other vertebrate animals, is pos- 
sessed of a carpus and a metacarpus, also a tarsus and a 
metatarsus.

I study ‘“‘Viri Romae” every day but Friday and Saturday. 
Friday is French day, and then I study a French translation 
book called Bonnechose’s “History of France,’’ and next week 
I am to begin in Ollendorf’s Exercises. Saturday we learn 
poetry, and as soon as we have recited that, we are at liberty 
to go home, so that yesterday I got home before eleven. Other 
days I do not get home till after two sometimes. Professor 
Gould comes several times a week to give us lectures, and ex- 
plain what we have gone over in zodlogy, and brings with him 
in a bundle monkeys’ skulls, and Polypi, a marine animal. .. . 
There are about seventy scholars in the school, and three 
assistant teachers. Gam. Bradford’s sister, Fanny Bradford, 
is one of the teachers. Each assistant has a little room of her 
own, and when I recite to an assistant I am closeted with her 
in one of said little rooms... .

Wuen Louisa May Alcott (1832-1888) was thirteen years 
old, one of her heart’s desires was to have a little room of her 
own. The custom of sending little notes to one another existed 
in the Alcott family; and the tiny letter from Louisa to her 
mother shows how bravely she was giving up hope of her 
little sanctum. We are glad to read in her journal that, shortly 
afterwards, her wish was gratified. Miss Alcott’s books are 
familiar to all young readers and much of the family life and 
family struggles is recorded in them.

2. TO HER NEPHEWS 
New York, Dec. 4, 1875. 
DEAR FRED AND DoNNy,—We went to see the newsboys, and 
I wish you ’d been with us, it was so interesting. A nice big 
house has been built for them, with dining-room and kitchen on 
the first floor, bath-rooms and school-room next, two big 
sleeping-piaces,—third and fourth stories,—and at the top a 
laundry and gymnasium. We saw all the tables set for break- 
fast,—a plate and bowl for each,—and in the kitchen great 
kettles, four times as big as our copper boiler, for tea and cof- 
fee, soup, and meat. They have bread and meat and coffee for 
breakfast, and bread and cheese and tea for supper, and get 
their own dinners out. School was just over when we got 
there, and one hundred and eighty boys were in the immense 
room with desks down the middle, and all round the walls were 
little cupboards, numbered. Each boy on coming in gives his 
name, pays six cents, gets a key, and puts away his hat, books, 
and jacket (if he has ’em) in his own cubby for the night. 
They pay five cents for supper, and schooling, baths, etc., are 
free. They were a smart-looking set, larking round in shirts 
and trousers, barefooted, but the faces were clean, and the heads 
40

smooth, and clothes pretty decent; yet they support themselves, 
for not one of them has any parents or home but this. One 
little chap, only six, was trotting round as busy as a bee, lock- 
ing up his small shoes and ragged jacket as if they were great 
treasures. I asked about little Pete, and the man told us his 
brother, only nine, supported him and took care of him entirely; 
and would n’t let Pete be sent away to any home because he 
wished to have “his family” with him. 
Think of that, Fred! How would it seem to be all alone 
in a big city, with no mamma to cuddle you; no two grandpas’ 
houses to take you in; not a penny but what you earned, and 
Donny to take care of? Could you do it? Nine-year-old 
Patsey does it capitally; buys Pete’s clothes, pays for his bed 
and supper, and puts pennies in the savings-bank. ‘There’s 
a brave little man for you! I wanted to see him; but he is 
a newsboy, and sells late papers, because, though harder work, 
it pays better, and the coast is clear for those who do it. 
The savings-bank was a great table all full of slits, each one 
leading to a little place below and numbered outside, so each 
boy knows his own. Once a month the bank is opened, and the 
lads take out what they like, or have it invested in a big bank 
for them to have when they find homes out West, as many do, 
and make good farmers. One boy was putting in some pennies 
as we looked, and I asked how much he had saved this 
month. ‘Fourteen dollars, ma’am,” says the thirteen-year- 
older, proudly slipping in the last cent. A prize of $3 is of- 
fered to the lad who saves the most in a month. 
The beds upstairs were in two immense rooms, ever so much 
larger than our town hall,—one hundred in one, and one hun- 
dred and eighty in another,—all narrow beds with a blue quilt, 
neat pillow, and clean sheet. They are built in long rows, 
one over another, and the upper boy has to climb up as on 
board ship. I’d have liked to see one hundred and eighty all 
in their “by-lows” at once, and I asked the man if they 
41

_ didn’t train when all were in. “Lord, ma’am, they ’re up at 
five, poor little chaps, and are so tired at night that they drop 
off right away. Now and then some boy kicks up a little row, 
but we have a watchman, and he soon settles ’em.”’ 
He also told me how that very day a neat, smart young man 
came in, and said he was one of their boys who went West with 
a farmer only a little while ago; and now he owned eighty 
acres of land, had a good house, and was doing well, and had 
come to New York to find his sister, and to take her away to 
live with him. Wasn’t that nice? Lots of boys do as well. 
Instead of loafing round the streets and getting into mischief, 
they are taught to be tidy, industrious, and honest, and then 
sent away into the wholesome country to support themselves. 
It was funny to see ’em scrub in the bath-room—feet and 
faces,—comb their hair, fold up their old clothes in the dear 
cubbies, which make them so happy because they feel that they 
own something. 
The man said every boy wanted one, even though he had 
neither shoes nor jacket to put in it; but would lay away an old 
rag of a cap or a dirty tippet with an air of satisfaction fine 
to see. Some lads sat reading, and the man said they loved 
it so they ’d read all night, if allowed. At nine he gave the 
word, “Bed!” and away went the lads, trooping up to sleep in 
shirts and trousers, as nightgowns are not provided. How 
would a boy I know like that,—a boy who likes to have 
“trommin” on his nighties? Of course, I don’t mean dandy 
Don! Oh, dear no! 
After nine [if late in coming in] they are fined five cents; 
after ten, ten cents; and after eleven they can’t come in at all. 
This makes them steady, keeps them out of harm, and gives 
them time for study. Some go to the theatre, and sleep any- 
where; some sleep at the Home, but go out for a better break- 
fast than they get there, as the swell ones are fond of goodies, 
and live well in their funny way. Coffee and cakes at Fulton

3. TO MR. F. P. TRUE 
Concorp, October 24. 
Dear Sir,—I never copy or “polish,” so I have no old manu- 
scripts to send-you; and if I had it would be of little use, for 
one person’s method is no rule for another. Each must work 
in his own way; and the only drill needed is to keep writing 
and profit by criticism. Mind grammar, spelling, and punctua- 
tion, use short words, and express as briefly as you can your 
meaning. Young people use too many adjectives and try to 
“write fine.” The strongest, simplest words are best, and no 
foreign ones if it can be helped. 
Write, and print if you can; if not, still write, and improve 
as you go on. Read the best books, and they will improve 
your style. See and hear good speakers and wise people, and 
learn of them. Work for twenty years, and then you may 
some day find that you have a style and place of your own, 
and can command good pay for the same-things no one would 
take when you were unknown. 
I know little of poetry, as I never read modern attempts, but 
advise any young person to keep to prose, as only once in a 
century is there a true poet; and verses are so easy to do that

it is not much help to write them. I have so many letters like 
your own that I can say no more, but wish you success, and 
give you for a motto Michael Angelo’s wise words: ‘Genius 
is infinite patience.”

P. S.—The lines you send are better than many I see; but 
boys of nineteen cannot know much about hearts, and had 
better write of things they understand. Sentiment is apt to 
become sentimentality; and sense is always safer, as well as 
better drill, for young fancies and feelings. 
Read Ralph Waldo Emerson, and see what good prose is, 
and some of the best poetry we have. I much prefer him to 
Longfellow.

NATHANIEL HawtHorne (1804-1864) drew from seafaring 
ancestors his love of travel and of the sea. He was sensitive 
and unworldly, and keenly alive to the beauty of nature, of 
language and literature and of life itself. Among his friends 
he numbered Herman Melville, the writer of so many sea 
stories. His desire for travel was first gratified when he went 
to Liverpool as United States Consul. There, with his family, 
he spent some time at the boarding house of Mrs. Blodgett, 
“who loved all her boarders and they all loved her.” To his 
son Julian, then a small, sturdy school-boy, he wrote of this 
kindly landlady’s good dinners in faithful detail.

shire pudding: but if he had preferred it, he might have had 
some chicken-pie, with nice paste; or some roast duck, which 
looked very good; or some tripe fried in batter; or some boiled 
chicken,—or a great many other delectable things. And we 
had two kinds of fish,—boiled salmon and fried soles. I my- 
self ate salmon; but the soles seemed to be very nice too. And 
we had so many green peas that they were not half eaten, and 
string-beans besides,—oh, how nice! When the puddings, 
and tarts, and custards, and Banbury cakes, and cheese- 
cakes, and greengages, and that kind of stuff was put on the 
table, I had hardly any appetite left; but I did manage to eat 
some currant pudding, and a Banbury cake, and a Victoria cake, 
and a slice of a beautiful Spanish musk-melon, and some plums. 
If you had been there, I think you would have had a very 
good dinner, and there would not have been nearly so many 
nice things left on the table.

James Russett Lowett (1819-1891) was the youngest of the

are all very well except Nemaise, who has got another piece of 
glass in his leg and is waiting for the doctor to take it out, and 
Samuel Storrow is also sick. I am going to have a new suit 
of blue broadcloth clothes to wear every day and to play in. 
Mother tells me that I may have any sort of buttons I choose. 
I have not done anything to the hut but if you wish I will. 
I am now very happy; but I should be more so if you were 
there. I hope you will answer my letter if you do not I shall 
write you no more letters. when you write my letters you must 
direct them all to me and not write half to mother as gener- 
ally do. Mother has given me the three volumes of tales of a

RatpH Watpo Emerson (1803-1882), the poet and essayist, 
has also been called a prophet and a seer. His father died 
when he was in his ninth year; and it was a hard struggle for 
the mother to bring up her family on her scanty income. 
Emerson grew up in an atmosphere of frugality and strict dis- 
cipline. It was always the expectation of his mother, and also 
of his aunt, that he would some day fill a position of distinction. 
This devoted aunt’s interest in the little household may be 
gathered from Emerson’s letter to her, telling her of a day’s 
doings. This busy little lad was only nine years old when he 
wrote the letter.

that is what you meant by giving an account of one single day 
in my life. Friday, 9th, I choose for the day of telling what I 
did. In the Morning I rose, as I commonly do, about five 
minutes before six. I then help Wm. in making the fire, after 
which I set the table for Prayers. I then call mamma about

of my heart when one of my Brothers gets above me, which I 
think sometimes they do by unfair means, after which we eat 
our breakfast; then I have from about quarter after seven 
till eight to play or read. I think I am rather inclined to the 
former. I then go to school, where I hope I can say I study 
more than I did a little while ago. I am in another book called 
Virgil, and our class are even with another which came to the 
Latin School one year before us. After attending this school I 
go to Mr. Webb’s private school, where I write and cipher. I 
go to this place at eleven and stay till one o’clock. After this, 
when I come home I eat my dinner, and at two o’clock I re- 
sume my studies at the Latin School, where I do the same except 
in studying grammar. After I come home I do mamma her 
little errands if she has any; then I bring in my wood to 
supply the breakfast room. I then have some time to play and 
eat my supper. After that we say our hymns or chapters, © 
and then take our turns in reading Rollin, as we did before 
you went. We retire to bed at different times. I go at a little 
after eight, and retire to my private devotions, and then close 
my eyes in sleep, and there ends the toils of the day....TI

My Dear Boys: | 
I received your letters with the greatest pleasure, and, as I 
always like to talk to you both together, I will not separate you 
in my letters, but write one to you both. I was much grati- 
fied to hear of your progress at school, and hope that you will 
continue to advance and that I shall have the happiness of 
finding you much improved in all your studies on my return. 
I shall not feel my long separation from you if I find that 
my absence has been of no injury to you, and that you have both 
grown in goodness and knowledge, as well as stature. But 
oh, how much will I suffer on my return if the reverse has 
occurred! ‘You enter into all my thoughts, in all my prayers; 
and on you, in part, will depend whether I shall be happy or 
miserable, as you know how much I love you. You must do 
all in your power to save me pain.

were with me. ‘The river was so calm and beautiful, and the 
boys were playing about in boats, and swimming their ponies. 
Then there were troops of donkeys carrying water through the 
streets. They had a kind of saddle, something like a cart 
saddle, though larger, that carried two ten-gallon kegs on each 
side, which was a load for a donkey. They had no bridles 
on, but would come along in strings to the river, and as soon 
as their kegs were filled, start off again. They were fatter and 
slicker than any donkeys I had ever seen before, and seemed to 
be better cared for. I saw a great many ponies too. They were 
much larger than those in the upper country, but did not seem 
so enduring. I got one to ride around the fortifications. He had 
a Mexican bit and saddle on, and paced delightfully but every 
time my sword struck him on the flanks, would jump and try 
to run off. Several of them had been broken to harness by 
the Americans and I saw some teams in wagons, driven four 
in hand, well matched and trotting well. We had a grand 
parade on General Scott’s arrival. ‘The troops were all drawn 
up on the bank of the river, and fired a salute as he passed 
them. He landed at the market, where lines of sentinels were 
placed to keep off the crowd. In front of the landing the ar- 
tillery was drawn up, which received him in the center of the 
column and escorted him through the streets to his lodgings. 
They had provided a handsome gray horse, richly caparisoned, 
for him to ride, but he preferred to walk with his staff around 
him, and a dragoon led the horse behind us. The windows 
along the streets we passed were crowded with people, and the 
boys and girls were in great glee—the Governor’s Island band 
playing all the time. 
There were six thousand soldiers in Tampico. Mr. Barry 
was the adjutant of the escort. I think you would have enjoyed

it, but my poor Joe is so sick all the time, I can do nothing with 
him. I left Jem to come on with the horses, as I was afraid 
they would not be properly cared for. Vessels were expressly 
fitted up for the horses and parties of dragoons detached to take 
care of them. I had hoped they would reach here by this time, - 
as I wanted to see how they were fixed. I took every pre- 
caution for their comfort, provided them with bran, oats, etc., 
and had slings made to pass under them and be attached to 
the coverings above, so that, if in a heavy sea, they should not 
fall. I had to sell my good old horse “Jim” as I could 
not find room for him, or, rather, I did not want to crowd 
the others. I know I shall want him when I land. “Creole” 
was the admiration of every one at Brazos, and they hardly 
believed she had carried me so far, and looked so well. Jem 
says there is nothing like her in all the country, and I believe 
he likes her better than “Tom” or “Jerry.” The sorrel mare 
did not appear to be so well after I got to the Brazos. I had to 
put one of the men on her whose horse had given out, and the 
saddle hurt her back. She had gotten well, however, before 
I left, and I told Jem to ride her every day. I hope they may 
both reach the shore again in safety, but I fear they will have 
a hard time. They will first have to be put aboard a steam- 
boat and carried to the ship that lies about two miles out at sea, 
then hoisted in, and how we shall get them ashore again I do 
not know. Probably throw them overboard and let them swim 
there. I do not think we shall remain here more than one day 
longer. General Worth’s and General Twigg’s divisions have 
arrived, which include the regulars, and I suppose the volun- 
teers will be coming on every day. We shall probably go on the 
first down the coast, select a place for debarkation, and make 
all the arrangements preparatory to the arrival of the troops. 
T shall have plenty to do there, and am anxious for the time 
to come, and hope all may be successful. Tell Rob he must

Wuen Benjamin Franklin (1706-1790) was representative 
for the Colonies in England, he had no more valued or familiar 
friends than the family of Jonathan Shipley, the Bishop of St. 
Asaph’s. Georgiana, the fourth daughter of the bishop, was a 
young girl of great talent and a pupil of Sir Joshua Reynolds. 
She afterwards became a painter of some distinction and was 
the wife of Francis Hare-Naylor, and the mother of Augustus 
Hare. In her girlhood, she was very fond of unusual pets, and 
a squirrel, brought from America and given to her by Ben- 
jamin Franklin, was a great favorite. The tragic fate of poor 
Mungo may be read in the letter Franklin wrote to her when 
he heard the news. 
TO MISS GEORGIANA SHIPLEY 
Lonpon, September 26, 1772. 
DEAR Miss, 
I LAMENT with you most sincerely the unfortunate end of 
poor MUNGO. Few squirrels were better accomplished; for 
he had had a good education, had travelled far, and seen much 
of the world. As he had the honour of being, for his virtues, 
your favorite, he should not go, like common skuggs, without 
an elegy or an epitaph. Let us give him one in the monumental

style and measure, which, being neither prose nor verse, is 
perhaps the properest for grief; since to use common language 
would look as if we were not affected, and to make rhymes 
would seem trifling in sorrow. 
EPITAPH 
On the loss of an American squirrel, who, escaping from his 
cage, was killed by a shepherd’s dog. 
Alas! poor MUNGO! 
Happy wert thou, hadst thou known 
Thy own felicity. 
Remote from the fierce bald eagle, 
Tyrant of thy native woods, 
Thou hadst nought to fear from his piercing talons, 
Nor from the murdering gun, 
Of the thoughtless sportsman. 
Safe in thy wired castle, 
GRIMALKIN never could annoy thee. 
Daily wert thou fed with the choicest viands, 
By the fair hand of an indulgent mistress; 
But, discontented, 
Thou wouldst have more freedom. 
Too soon, alas! didst thou obtain it; 
And wandering, 
Thou art fallen by the fangs of Wanton, cruel RANGER! 
Learn hence 
Ye who blindly seek more liberty 
Whether subjects, sons, squirrels or daughters, 
That apparent restraint may be real protection; 
Yielding peace and plenty 
With security.

You see, my dear Miss, how much more decent and proper 
this broken style is, than if we were to say, by way of epitaph, 
Here SKUGG 
Lies snug, 
As a bug 
In a rug. 
and yet, perhaps, there are people in the world of so little feel- 
ing as to think that this would be a good-enough epitaph for 
poor Mungo. 
If you wish it, I shall procure another to succeed him; but 
perhaps you will now choose some other amusement. 
Remember me affectionately to all the good family, and 
believe me ever,

Wuen students of literature try to recall the names of the 
greatest letter-writers, they think immediately of a Scotchman, 
who lived in England, France, the United States, and finally 
died at the age of forty-four on the island of Samoa, Robert 
Louis Stevenson (1850-1894). Probably everyone reads Trea- 
sure Island, not once, but several times. Stevenson had the 
gift of letter-writing; his letters have the pleasant qualities of 
conversation. He enjoyed writing letters to very young people 
as the following letters will testify. 
1. TO THOMAS ARCHER + 
TautirA, Island of Taiti [November 1888] 
DEAR TOMARCHER, 
This is a pretty state of things! Seven o’clock and no word 
of breakfast! And I was awake a good deal last night, for 
it was full moon, and they had made a great fire of cocoa-nut 
husks down by the sea, and as we have no blinds or shutters, 
this kept my room very bright. And then the rats had a 
wedding or a school-feast under my bed. And then I woke 
early, and I have had nothing to read except Virgil’s Aeneid, 
which is not good fun on an empty stomach, and a Latin 
dictionary, which is good for naught, and by some humorous 
accident, your dear papa’s article on Skerryvore. And I read 
1From The Letters of Robert Louis Stevenson; copyright, 1911, by 
Charles Scribner’s Sons. By permission of the publishers. 
57
-P-A-G-E-78
  A BOOK OF LETTERS 
the whole of that, and very impudent it is, but you must not 
tell your dear papa I said so, or it might come to a battle in 
which you might lose either a dear papa or a valued corre- 
spondent, or both, which would be prodigal. And still no 
breakfast; so I said ‘Let ’s write to Tomarcher.’ 
This is a much better place for children than any I have 
hitherto seen in these seas. ‘The girls (and sometimes the boys) 
play a very elaborate kind of hopscotch. The boys play 
horses exactly as we do in Europe; and have very good fun 
on stilts, trying to knock each other down, in which they do 
not often succeed. The children of all ages go to church and 
are allowed to do what they please, running about the aisles, 
rolling balls, stealing mamma’s bonnet and publicly sitting on 
it, and at last going to sleep in the middle of the floor. I for- 
got to say that the whips to play horses, and the balls to roll 
about the church—at least I never saw them used elsewhere— 
grow ready made on trees; which is rough on toy-shops. The 
whips are so good that I wanted to play horses myself; but no 
such luck! my hair is gray, and I am a great, big, ugly 
man. The balls are rather hard, but very light and quite 
round. When you grow up and become offensively rich, you 
can charter a ship in the ‘port of London, and have it come 
back to -you entirely loaded with these balls; when you could 
satisfy your mind as to their character, and give them away 
when done with to your uncles and aunts. But what I really 
wanted to tell you was this: besides the tree-top toys (Hush- 
a-by, toy-shop, on the tree-top!), I have seen some real made 
toys, the first hitherto observed in the South Seas. 
This was how. You are to imagine a four-wheeled gig; one 
horse; in the front seat two Tahiti natives, in their Sunday 
clothes, blue coat, white shirt, kilt (a little longer than the 
Scotch) of a blue stuff with big white or yellow flowers, legs 
and feet bare; in the back seat me and my wife, who is a

friend of yours; under our feet, plenty of lunch and things: 
among us a great deal of fun in broken Tahitian, one of the 
natives, the sub-chief of the village, being a great ally of mine. 
Indeed we have exchanged names; so that he is now called 
Rui, the nearest they can come to Louis, for they have no l 
and no s in their language. Rui is six feet three in his 
stockings, and a magnificent man. We all have straw hats, 
for the sun is strong. We drive between the sea, which makes 
a great noise, and the mountains; the road is cut through a 
forest mostly of fruit trees, the very creepers, which take the 
place of our ivy, heavy with a great and delicious fruit, bigger 
than your head and far nicer, called Barbedine. Presently we 
came to a house in a pretty garden, quite by itself, very nicely 
kept, the doors and windows open, no one about, and no noise 
but that of the sea. It looked like a house in a fairy-tale, and 
just beyond we must ford a river, and there we saw the in- 
habitants. Just in the mouth of the river, where it met the 
sea waves, they were ducking and bathing and screaming 
together like a covey of birds: seven or eight little naked brown 
boys and girls as happy as the day was long: and on the banks 
of the stream beside them, real toys, toy ships, full rigged, 
and with their sails set, though they were lying in the dust 
on their beam ends. And then I knew for sure they were all 
children in a fairy-story, living alone together in that lonely 
house with the only toys in all the island; and that I had my- 
self driven, in my four-wheeled gig, into a corner of the fairy- 
story, and the question was should I get out again? But it was 
all right; I guess only one of the wheels of the gig had got into 
the fairy-story; and the next jolt the whole thing vanished, 
and we drove on in our sea-side forest as before, and I have 
the honour to be ‘Tomarcher’s valued correspondent, 
TERIITERA, which he was previously known as

[VarLIMA, June 19, 1891] 
DEAR Mr. IDE, 
Herewith please find the DOCUMENT, which I trust will 
prove sufficient in law. It seems to me very attractive in its 
eclecticism; Scots, English, and Roman law phrases are all in- 
differently introduced, and a quotation from the works of 
Haynes Bayly can hardly fail to attract the indulgence of the 
Bench. 
Yours very truly,

_I, Robert Louis Stevenson, Advocate of the Scots Bar, author 
of “The Master of Ballantrae” and “Moral Emblems,” stuck 
civil engineer, sole owner and patentee of the Palace and Plan- 
tation known as Vailima in the island of Upolu, Samoa, a Brit- 
ish Subject, being in sound mind, and pretty well, I thank you, 
in body. 
In consideration that Miss Annie H. Ide, daughter of H. C. 
Ide, in the town of Saint Johnsbury, in the county of Cale- 
donia, in the State of Vermont, United States of America, was 
born, out of all reason, upon Christmas Day, and is therefore 
out of all justice denied the consolation and profit of a proper 
birthday; : 
And considering that I, the said Robert Louis Stevenson, 
have attained an age when O, we never mention it, and that 
I have now no further use for a birthday of any description; 
And in consideration that I have met H. C. Ide, the father of 
the said Annie H. Ide, and found him about as white a land 
commissioner as I require: 
Have transferred, and do hereby transfer, to the said Annie 
H. Ide, all and whole my rights and privileges in the thirteenth

by the sporting of fine raiment, eating of rich meats, and receipt 
of gifts, compliments, and copies of verse, according to the 
manner of our ancestors; 
And I direct the said Annie H. Ide to add to the said name 
of Annie H. Ide the name Louisa—at least in private; and 
I charge her to use my said birthday with moderation and 
humanity, et tamquam bona filia familiae, the said birthday 
not being so young as it once was, and having carried me in 
a very satisfactory manner since I can remember; 
And in case the said Annie H. Ide shall neglect or contravene 
either of the above conditions, I hereby. revoke the donation 
and transfer my rights in the said birthday to the President 
of the United States of America for the time being:

My Dear Lovutsa, 
Your picture of the church, the photograph of yourself and 
your sister, and your very witty and pleasing letter, came all 
in a bundle, and made me feel I had my money’s worth for that 
birthday. I am now, I must be, one of your nearest relatives;

exactly what we are to each other, I do not know, I doubt 
if the case has ever happened before—your papa ought to 
know, and I don’t believe he does; but I think I ought to call - 
you in the meanwhile, and until we get the advice of counsel 
learned in the law, my name-daughter. Well, I was extremely 
pleased to see by the church that my name-daughter could draw; 
by the letter, that she was no fool; and by the photograph, 
that she was a pretty girl, which hurts nothing. See how 
virtues are rewarded! My first idea of adopting you was en- 
tirely charitable; and here I find that I am quite proud of it, 
and of you, and that I chose just the kind of name-daughter I 
wanted. For I can draw too, or rather I mean to say I could 
before I forgot how; and I am very far from being a fool my- 
self, however much I may look it; and I am as beautiful as 
the day, or at least I once hoped that perhaps I might be go- 
ing to be. And so I might. So that you see we are well met, 
and peers on these important points. I am very glad that you 
are older than your sister. So should I have been, if I had 
had one. So that the number of points and virtues which you 
have inherited from your name-father is already surprising. 
I wish that you would tell your father—not that I like to 
encourage my rival—that we have had a wonderful time here 
of late, and that they are having a cold day on Mulinuu, and 
the consuls are writing reports, and I am writing to the 
Times, and if we don’t get rid of our friends this time I 
shall begin to despair of everything but my name-daughter. 
You are quite wrong as to the effect of the birthday on your 
age. From the moment the deed was registered (as it was in 
the public press with every solemnity), the 13th of November 
became your own and only birthday, and you ceased to have 
been born on Christmas Day. Ask your father: I am sure 
he will tell you this is sound law. You are thus become a 
month and twelve days younger than you were, but will go 
on growing older for the future in the regular and human man-

ner from one 13th November to the next. The effect on me is 
more doubtful; I may, as you suggest, live for ever; I might, 
on the other hand, come to pieces like the one-horse shay at a 
moment’s notice; doubtless the step was risky, but I do not 
the least regret that which enables me to sign myself your 
revered and delighted name-father,

CrarLtes Lutwipce Dopcson (1832-1898) is better known as 
Lewis Carroll. He was a distinguished mathematician and 
clergyman. His fame, however, rests mainly on two books, 
Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass. The 
reader of Lewis Carroll’s letters will find the same humorous, 
teasing, joking quality that made Alice the friendly acquaint- 
ance of children the world over. The frontispiece of this book 
is the picture of the little girl who suggested the story of Alice 
in Wonderland to Lewis Carroll. 
Lewis Carroll was a thirteen-year old boy away at school

have played two tricks upon me which were these—they first. 
proposed to play at “King of the Cobblers” and asked if I 
would be king, to which I agreed. Then they made me sit 
down and sat (on the ground) in a circle round me, and 
told me to say “Go to work” which I said, and they im- 
mediately began kicking me and knocking me on all sides. 
The next game they proposed was ‘Peter, the red lion,” and 
they made a mark on a tombstone (for we were playing in the 
churchyard) and one of the boys walked with his eyes shut, 
trying to touch the mark; at last it was my turn; they told me 
to shut my eyes well, and the next minute I had my finger in 
the mouth of one of the boys, who had stood (I believe) before 
the tombstone with his mouth open. For 2 nights I slept alone, 
and for the rest of the time with Ned Swire. The boys play 
me no tricks now. ‘The only fault (tell Mama) that there has 
been was coming in one day to dinner just after grace. On 
Sunday we went to church in the morning, and sat in a large 
pew with Mr. Fielding, the church we went to is close by Mr. 
Tate’s house, we did not go in the afternoon but Mr. Tate 
read a discourse to the boys on the 5th commandment. We 
went to church again in the evening. Papa wished me to tell 
him all the texts I had heard preached upon, please to tell him 
that I could not hear it in the morning nor hardly one sentence 
of the sermon, but the one in the evening was I Cor. i. 23. I

CuHRIsT CHURCH, OxrFrorD, October 13, 1875. 
My Dear GERTRUDE,— 
I never give birthday presents, but you see I do sometimes 
write a birthday letter: so, as I’ve just arrived here, I am 
writing this to wish you many and many a happy return of 
your birthday to-morrow. I will drink your health, if only 
I can remember, and if you don’t mind—but perhaps you ob- 
ject? You see, if I were to sit by you at breakfast, and to 
drink your tea, you would n’t like that, would you? You would 
say “Boo! hoo! MHere’s Mr. Dodgson’s drunk all my tea, and 
I have n’t got any left!”” So I am very much afraid, next time 
Sybil looks for you, she ’ll find you sitting by the sad sea-wave, 
and crying ‘Boo! hoo! MHere’s Mr. Dodgson has drunk my 
health, and I have n’t got any left!” And how it will puzzle 
Dr. Maund, when he is sent for to see you! “My dear 
Madam, I’m very sorry to say your little girl has got no health 
at all! I never saw such a thing in my life!” “Oh, I can 
easily explain it!” your mother will say. “You see she would 
go and make friends with a strange gentleman, and yesterday 
he drank her health!” ‘Well, Mrs. Chataway,” he will say, 
“the only way to cure her is to wait till his next birthday, 
and then for her to drink his health.” 
And then we shall have changed healths. I wonder how 
you "ll like mine. Oh, Gertrude, I wish you would n’t talk 
such nonsense! .. .

My DrEar GERTRUDE,— 
This really will not do, you know, sending one more kiss 
every time by post: the parcel gets so heavy it is quite ex- 
pensive. When the postman brought in the last letter, he looked 
quite grave. “T'wo pounds to pay, sir!” he said. “Extra 
weight, sir!” (I think he cheats a little, by the way. He of- 
ten makes me pay two pounds, when I think it should be 
pence). “Oh, if you please, Mr. Postman!” I said, going 
down gracefully on one knee (I wish you could see me go 
down on one knee to a postman—it’s a very pretty sight), 
“do excuse me just this once! It’s only from a little girl!” 
“Only from a little girl!” he growled. ‘What are little 
girls made of? “Sugar and spice,” I began to say, “and 
all that’s ni—” but he interrupted me. ‘‘No! I don’t mean 
that. I mean, what’s the good of little girls, when they send 
such heavy letters?” “Well, they ’re not much good, cer- 
tainly,” I said, rather sadly. 
“Mind you don’t get any more such letters,” he said, “at 
least, not from that particular little girl. JI know her well, 
and she’s a regular bad one!” ‘That’s not true, is it? I 
don’t believe he ever saw you, and you ’re not a bad one, are 
you? However, I promised him we would send each other 
very few more letters—‘‘Only two thousand four hundred and 
seventy, or so,” I said. “Oh!” he said, ‘‘a little number like 
that doesn’t signify. What I meant is, you mustn’t send 
many.” 
So you see we must keep count now, and when we get to two 
thousand four hundred and seventy, we mustn’t write any 
more, unless the postman gives us leave.

You will be sorry, and surprised, and puzzled, to hear what 
a queer illness I have had ever since you went. I sent for the 
doctor, and said, “Give me some medicine, for I’m tired.” 
He said, “Nonsense and stuff! You don’t want medicine: 
go to bed!” I said, “No; it isn’t the sort of tiredness that 
wants bed. I’m tired in the face.” He looked a little grave, 
and said, “Oh, it’s your nose that’s tired: a person often 
talks too much when he thinks he nose a great deal.” I said, 
“No; it isn’t the nose. Perhaps it’s the hair.” Then he 
looked rather grave, and said, “Now I understand: you ’ve 
been playing too many hairs on the piano-forte.” ‘No, in- 
deed I have n’t!” I said, “and it isn’t exactly the hair: it’s 
more about the nose and chin.” Then he looked a good deal 
graver, and said, ‘““Have you been walking much on your chin 
lately?’ I said, “No.” “Well!” he said, “it puzzles me very 
much. Do you think that it’s in the lips?” “Of course!” I 
said. ‘“That’s exactly what it is!’ Then he looked very 
grave indeed, and said, “I think you must have been giving 
too many kisses.” ‘Well,” I said, “I did give one kiss to a 
baby child, a little friend of mine.” , “Think again,” he said;

“are you sure it was only one?’”’ I thought again, and said, 
“Perhaps it was eleven times.”” Then the doctor said, “You 
must not give her any more till your lips are quite rested again.” 
“But what am I to do?” I said, “because you see, I owe her a 
hundred and eighty-two more.” ‘Then he looked so grave that 
the tears ran down his cheeks, and he said, “You may send 
them to her in a box.’”’? Then I remembered a little box that I 
once bought at Dover, and thought I would some day give it 
to some little girl or other. So I have packed them all in it 
very carefully. Tell me if they come safe, or if any are lost 
on the way.

My DrEar GERTRUDE,— 
I’m afraid it’s “no go”—I ’ve had such a bad cold all the 
week that I’ve hardly been out for some days, and I don’t 
think it would be wise to try the expedition this time, and I 
leave here on Tuesday. But after all, what does it signify? 
Perhaps there are ten or twenty gentlemen, all living within a 
few miles of Rotherwick, and any one of them would do just as - 
well! When a little girl is hoping to take a plum off a dish, 
and finds that she can’t have that one, because it’s bad or 
unripe, what does she do? Is she sorry or disappointed? 
Not a bit! She just takes another instead, and grins from 
one little ear to the other as she puts it to her lips! This is 
a little fable to do you good; the little girl means you—the bad 
plum means me—the other plum means some other friend— 
and all that about the little girl putting plums to her lips 
means—well, it means—but you know you can’t expect every 
bit of a fable to mean something! And the little girl grinning

I send you 434 kisses. 
6. TO AGNES HUGHES 
My Dear AGNES,— 
You lazy thing! What? I’m to divide the kisses myself, 
am I? Indeed, I won’t take the trouble to do anything of the 
sort! But Ill tell you how to do it. First, you must take 
four of the kisses, and—and that reminds me of a very curious 
thing that happened to me at half-past four yesterday. Three 
visitors came knocking at my door, begging me to let them in. 
And when I opened the door, who do you think they were? 
You ’ll never guess. Why, they were three cats! Wasn’t it 
curious? However, they all looked so cross and disagreeable 
that I took up the first thing I could lay my hand on (which 
happened to be the rolling-pin) and knocked them all down 
as flat as pan-cakes! “If you come knocking at my door,” I 
said, “J shall come knocking at your heads.” ‘That was fair, 
was n’t it? 
Yours affectionately, 
LEWIS CARROLL 
7. TO THE SAME 
My Dear AGNES,— 
About the cats, you know. Of course I did n’t leave them ly- 
ing on the ground like dried flowers: no, I picked them up, and 
I was as kind as I could be to them. I lent them the port-

folio for a bed—they would n’t have been comfortable in a 
real bed, you know: they were too thin—but they were quite 
happy between the sheets of blotting-paper—and each of them 
had a pen-wiper for a pillow. Well, then I went to bed: but 
first I lent them the three dinner-bells, to ring if they wanted 
anything in the night. 
You know I have three dinner-bells—the first (which is the 
largest) is rung when dinner is nearly ready; the second 
(which is rather larger) is rung when it is quite ready; and 
the third (which is as large as the other two put together) is 
rung all the time I am at dinner. Well, I told them they 
might ring if they happened to want anything—and, as they 
rang all the bells all the time I suppose they did want some- 
thing or other, only I was too sleepy to attend to them. 
In the morning I gave them some rat-tail jelly and buttered 
mice for breakfast and they were as discontented as they could 
be. They wanted some boiled pelican, but of course I knew it 
would n’t be good for them. So all I said was “Go to Num- 
ber Two, Finborough Road, and ask for Agnes Hughes, and 
if it’s really good for you, she Il give you some.” ‘Then I 
shook hands with them all, and wished them all goodbye, and 
drove them up the chimney. They seemed sorry to go, and 
they took the bells and the portfolio with them. I didn’t find 
this out till after they had gone, and then I was sorry too, and 
wished for them back again. What do I mean by “them’’? 
Never mind. : 
How are Arthur, and Amy, and Emily? Do they still go 
up and down Finborough Road, and teach the cats to be kind 
to mice? I’m very fond of all the cats in Finborough Road. 
Give them my love. 
Who do I mean by “‘them’’? 
Never mind.

8. TO ADELAIDE PAINE 
AN Acrostic written on the fly-leaf of a copy of The Hunting 
of the Snark sent by Mr. Dodgson to Miss Adelaide Paine. 
“Are you deaf, Father William?” the young man said, 
“D id you hear what I told you just now?

“A nd seal it with olive-and-dove. 
‘I command you to do it!” he added with pride, 
*N or forget, my good fellow, to send her beside 
“E aster Greetings, and give her my love.” 
The letter which followed: 
My Dear ADELAIDE,— 
Did you try if the letters at the beginnings of the lines about 
Father William would spell anything? Sometimes it happens 
that you can spell out words that way, which is very curious. 
I wish you could have heard him when he shouted out 
“Pack it up in brown paper!” It quite shook the house. 
And he threw one of his shoes at his son’s head (just to make 
him attend, you know), but it missed him. 
He was glad to hear you had got the book safe, but his 
eyes filled with tears as he said, “I sent her my love, but she 
never—” he could n’t say any more, his mouth was so full of 
bones (he was just finishing a roast goose).

MANDELL CREIGHTON (1843-1901) was a distinguished Eng- 
lish churchman, a Doctor of Divinity of both Oxford and Cam- 
bridge Universities. For many years he was Bishop of Peter- 
borough and, later, Bishop of London. The story of his life 
at the Bishop’s Palace at Peterborough is interesting, for there 
his family grew up, as simply and naturally as was possible in 
the dignified establishment of an English Bishop. They were a 
merry, active lot of boys and girls; and their father delighted 
in joining in their games,—skating, hockey, cricket, and even 
dancing. He even insisted that the learned and dignified clergy 
who visited at his house should do the same. He had the gift 
of epigram, of short terse sentences containing a vital truth; 
and much wisdom is to be found in his brief letters. His niece, 
Winifred Creighton, was a favorite correspondent. 
TO HIS NIECE WINIFRED 
LucANO, September 10, 1897. 
Don’t make efforts to write to me, but brabble on as if you 
were talking, and tell me all that you are thinking about. You 
know that I want to get you to unpack yourself. We all be- 
gin by being vague and dreamy, and the process of life is to 
get us to see things clearly. We can never do this except by 
writing. Even talking is nothing compared to writing. Ideas 
when put into shape stay with us, and we can recall them and 
correct them. So please write me very fully about yourself. 
. . . Success in life means making one’s life large. We all 
live in the same world, but each of us lives in that part of the 
world which we choose to make our own. Your danger is to 
live in a small world because you cannot take the trouble to 
explore. I want you to feel and think, and struggle into more 
and more ideas. I am glad you enjoy Stevenson; he is a per-

One of England’s greatest scientists, Thomas Henry Huxley, 
(1825-1895) wrote and lectured learnedly about science, and 
numbered such scholars as Spencer, Tyndall, and Darwin 
among his closest friends. His letters from various quarters 
of the globe are pleasant reading; his letters to his children 
are full of humor and affection. The letter about Waterbabies 
to his little grandson was printed in a large hand, so that the

You are touching manhood now, my dear laddie, and I trust

The great thing in the world is not so much to seek happiness

My dear, I should like to have given you some good coun-

Cuarces Kincstry (1819-1875) is best known as the author 
of the enthralling tale of adventure, Westward Ho! Hewasa 
man of the highest character and ideals; but was content to 
spend the best years of his life in the country parish of Evers- 
ley, caring for the welfare of his people, and bringing up his 
children to be true to the traditions of their race. There were 
four of these little people, Rose and Maurice and Grenville and 
Mary; and when he went abroad, he wrote long and pictur- 
esque letters to them, trying to share his new and strange 
experiences with those who were left at home. 
1. TO HIS YOUNGEST BOY 
Pav. [1864] 
- My Dear LITTLE MAN, 
I was quite delighted to get a letter from you so nicely writ- 
ten. Yesterday I went by the railway to a most beautiful 
place, where I am staying now. A town with an old castle, 
hundreds of years old, where the great King Henry IV of 
France was born, and his cradle is there still, made of a huge 
tortoiseshell. Underneath the castle are beautiful walks and 
woods—all green, as if it was summer, and roses and 
flowers, and birds singing—but different from our English 
birds. But it is quite summer here because it is so far south. 
76
-P-A-G-E-97
  BRITISH LETTER-WRITERS 
Under the castle, by the river, are frogs that make a noise like 
a rattle, and frogs that bark like toy-dogs, and frogs that 
climb up trees, and even up the window-panes—they have 
suckers on their feet, and are quite green like a leaf. Far 
away, before the castle are the great mountains, ten thousand 
feet high, covered with snow, and the clouds crawling about 
their tops. I am going to see them to-morrow, and when I 
come back I will tell you. But I have been out to-night, and 
all the frogs are croaking still, and making a horrid noise. 
Mind and be a good boy and give Baba my love. ‘There is a 
vulture here in the inn, but he is a little Egyptian vulture, not 
like the great vulture I saw at Bayonne. Ask mother to show 
you his picture in the beginning of the bird book. He is 
called Neophra Egyptiacus, and is an ugly fellow, who eats 
dead horses and sheep.

catch lots of trout with a fly; and a real gillie in a kilt, who, 
when he and I caught a salmon two days ago, celebrated the 
event by putting on his Prince of Wales’s tartan and uniform, 
taking an enormous bagpipe, and booming like an elephantine 
bumble-bee all round the dinner-table, and then all about the 
house. It is very pleasant—like a dream—real stags in the for-

princesses walking about; but I long to be home again with you 
all, and that is truth. Love to Rose, and tell her to write to me

3. TO THE SAME 
Brarrirz [1864] 
My Daruinc Mary, 
I am going to write you a long letter qbout all sorts of things. 
And first, this place is full of the prettiest children I ever saw, 
very like English, but with dark hair and eyes, and none of 
them look poor or ragged; but so nicely dressed, with striped 
stockings, which they knit themselves, and Basque shoes, made 
of canvas, worked with red and purple worsted. There is a 
little girl here six years old, a chemist’s daughter, who knits 
all her own woollen stockings. All the children go to a school 
kept by nuns; and I am sure the poor nuns are very kind to 
them, for they laugh and romp, it seems to me, all day long. 
In summer most of them wear no shoes or stockings, for they 
do not want them; but in winter they are wrapped up warm; 
and I have not seen one ragged child or tramp, or any one 
who looks miserable. They never wear any bonnets. The little

babies wear a white cap, and the children a woollen cap with 
pretty colours, and the girls a smart handkerchief on their 
back hair, and the boys and men wear blue and scarlet caps 
like Scotchmen, just the shape of mushrooms, and a red sash. 
The oxen here are quite yellow, and so gentle and wise, the 
men make them do exactly what they like. I will draw you 
an ox cart when I come home. The banks here are covered 
with enormous canes, as high as the eaves of our house. They 
tie one of these to a fir pole, and make a huge long rod, and 
then go and sit on the rocks and fish for dorados, which are 
fish with gilt heads. There are the most lovely sweet-smelling 
purple pinks on the rocks here, and the woods are full of 
asphodel, great lilies, four feet high, with white and purple 
flowers. I saw the wood yesterday where the dreadful fight was 
between the French and the English—and over the place where 
all the brave men lay buried grew one great flower-bed of 
asphodel. So they ‘slept in the meads of asphodel,’ like the old 
Greek heroes in Homer. There were great ‘lords and ladies’ 
(arums) there, growing in the bank, twice as big as ours, and 
not red, but white and primrose—most beautiful. But you can- 
not think how beautiful the commons are, they are like flower 
gardens, golden with furze, and white with potentilla, and 
crimson with sweet-smelling Daphne, and blue with the most 
wonderful blue flower which grows everywhere. I have dried 
them all. 
Tell your darling mother I am quite well, and will write 
to her to-morrow. There, that is all I have to say. Tell 
Grenville they have made a tunnel under the battle-field, 
for the railroad to go into Spain, and that on the top of the 
tunnel there is a shaft, and a huge wheel, to pump air into 
the tunnel, and that I will bring him home a scarlet Basque 
cap, and you and Rose Basque shoes... .

N has a swivel nose. It goes to right and left when she 
sniffs. I have told her the story of Martha Tatton to serve as 
a warning. Poor Martha had a swivel nose, and none could 
stop her from sniffing. One day it fixed on one side. Pull 
as she would, there it stuck. She rushed to a looking-glass, 
and fell tottering back. The pretty girl that she had been 
was ridiculous to behold. When she went to dinner she 
kept her hand over her nose, as long as she could, and taking 
knife and fork burst into tears over her plate, so that Robert, 
the footman, supposed her to have been stung by a wasp, and 
he fetched cold cream to rub on it, and was horrified by the 
hard fixity of the nose. All her fellow-servants were laughing 
while Martha cried, so the master of the house had a doctor 
called in. He declared that the mishap was caused by a 
cramped muscle of the nose. The only thing to be done was to 
have a powerful magnet outside and a needle inside. Robert 
and two maids held Martha’s right hand, Mrs. Whelks, the 
cook, a maid and the page boy her left. And presently the 
nose showed signs of tremours. “It’s coming,” cried the doctor. 
But the tremours had seized the assistants—they could hold on 
no longer, and back to its false position went Martha’s nose.

conceded to be the masterpiece. After youth and early married 
in Scotland, he moved to London and established himself at 5 
Cheyne Row, Chelsea. This unpretentious little house may be 
seen to-day with many personal belongings as they were in the 
days when Jane Welsh and Thomas Carlyle received there their 
distinguished guests. There one may see the upper room where 
The Life of Frederick the Great was written; the basement 
kitchen with its huge fireplace where Tennyson loved to sit and 
smoke his long “churchwarden” pipe; and, in the tiny back 
garden, the ivy blackened with London smoke, which was 
planted by Carlyle’s own hand. There were many brothers and 
sisters left behind in Scotland; and, to the youngest of them, 
little Jane, her brother wrote many letters. There are several 
volumes of Carlyle’s letters, some written to famous people; 
but none surpass in interest the letters to his little sister.

DEAR LITTLE JANE, 
Thou never wrotest me any kind of letter, yet I would be

never flinched from telling truth; and for all these things I 
love thee, my little Jane, and wish thee many blithe new years

ANOTHER writer whom every one reads is Charles Dickens 
(1812-1870). He seems a part of England and the English 
language, and it was fitting that he should have been buried in 
Westminster Abbey. In spite of the fact that he wrote novel 
after novel, and made lecture tours in England and the United 
States, he found time to write frequently to his friends and 
more frequently to his children and other children. Many of 
his letters were written from his home at Gad’s Hill, near 
Rochester, in Kent,—the Gad’s Hill where Falstaff engaged in 
the robbery. Dickens had his writing room in a shrubbery 
near the house, “up among the branches of the trees, where 
birds and butterflies fly in and out.”

I am going, within a very few days afterwards, a long dis-

long months, I have made up my mind to pass all that week

at home for their sakes; just as you would like your papa and 
mamma to spend all the time they possibly could spare with 
you if they were about to make a dreary voyage to America; 
just what I am going to do myself. 
But although I cannot come to see you on that day, you may 
be sure I shall not forget that it is your birthday, and that I 
shall drink your health and many happy returns in a glass of 
wine, filled as full as it will hold. And I shall dine at half- 
past five myself, so that we may both be drinking our wine at 
the same time; and I shall tell my Mary (for I have a daughter 
of that name but she is a very small one as yet) to drink your 
health too; and I shall try and make believe that you are here, 
or that we are in Russell Square, which is the best thing we 
~can do, I think, under the circumstances, 
You are growing up so fast that by the time I come home 
again I expect you will be almost a woman; and in a very few 
years we shall be saying to each other: ‘Don’t you remember 
what the birthdays used to be in Russell Square?” and “How 
strange it seems!” and “How quickly time passes!” and all 
that sort of thing, you know. But I shall always be very glad

I am not engaged on the evening of your birthday. But even 
if I had an engagement of the most particular kind, I should

BELFAST, 
Saturday, Twenty-eighth August, 1858. 
When I went down to the Rotunda at Dublin on Thursday 
night, I said to Arthur, who came rushing at me: “You 
need n’t tell me. I know all about it.” The moment I had 
come out of the door of the hotel (a mile off), I had come 
against the stream of people turned away. I had struggled 
against it to the room. There, the crowd in all the lobbies

and passages was so great, that I had a difficulty in getting in. 
They had broken all the glass in the pay-boxes. Our men 
were flattened against walls and squeezed against beams. 
Ladies stood all night with their chins against my platform. 
Other ladies sat all night upon my steps. You never saw such 
a sight! And the reading went tremendously! It is much to 
be regretted that we troubled ourselves to go anywhere else in 
Treland. 
_ We arrived here yesterday at two. The same scene was re- 
peated with the additional feature, that the people are much 
rougher here than in Dublin, and that there was a very great 
uproar at the opening of the doors, which, the police in at- 
tendance being quite inefficient arid only looking on, it was im- 
possible to check. Arthur was in the deepest misery because 
shillings got into stalls, and halfcrowns got into shillings, and 
stalls got nowhere, and there was immense confusion. It 
ceased, however, the moment I showed myself; and all went 
most brilliantly, in spite of a great piece of the cornice of the 
ceiling falling with a great crash within four or five inches 
of the head of a young lady on my platform (I was obliged 
to have people there), and in spite of my gas suddenly going 
out at the time of the game of forfeits at Scrooge’s nephew’s, 
through some Belfastian gentleman accidentally treading on 
the flexible pipe, and needing to be relighted. 
We shall not get to Cork before mid-day on Monday; it be- 
ing difficult to get from here on Sunday. We hope to be able 
to start away to-morrow morning to see the Giant’s Causeway 
(some sixteen miles off), and in that case we shall sleep at 
Dublin to-morrow night, leaving here by the train at half-past 
three in the afternoon. Dublin, you must understand, is on 
the way to Cork. This is a fine place, surrounded by lofty 
hills. The streets are very wide, and the place is very pros- 
perous. The whole ride from Dublin here is through a very 
picturesque and various country; and the amazing thing is, that 
87

it is all particularly neat and orderly, and that the houses (out- 
side at all events) are all brightly whitewashed and remark- 
ably clean. I want to climb one of the neighbouring hills be- 
fore this morning’s “‘Dombey.”’ 
Our men are deeply interested in the success, and are as 
zealous and ardent as possible.

My Dearest GIRLS, 
For if I were to write ‘‘young friends,” it would look like 
a schoolmaster; and if I were to write “young ladies,” it would 
look like a schoolmistress; and worse than that, neither form of 
words would look familiar and natural, or in character with 
our snowy ride that tooth-chattering morning. 
I cannot tell you both how gratified I was by your re- 
membrance, or how often I think of you as I smoke the ad- 
mirable cigars. But I almost think you must have had some 
magnetic consciousness across the Atlantic, of my whiffing my 
love towards you from the garden here. 
My daughter says that when you have settled those little 
public affairs at home, she hopes you will come back to Eng- 
land (possibly in united states) and give a minute or two to 
this part of Kent. Her words are, ‘‘a day or two’; but I 
remember your Italian flights, and correct the message. 
I have only just now finished my country readings, and have 
had nobody to make breakfast for me since the remote ages 
of Colchester!

6. TO HIS SON, EDWARD BULWER 
LYTTON DICKENS 
My DeEarEsT PLorn, 
I write this note to-day because your going away is much 
upon my mind, and because I want you to have a few parting 
words from me to think of now and then at quiet times. I 
need not tell you that I love you dearly, and am very, very 
sorry in my heart to part with you. But this life is half made 
up of partings, and these pains must be borne. It is my com- 
fort and my sincere conviction that you are going to try the 
life for which you are best fitted. I think its freedom and 
wildness more suited to you than any experiment in a study 
or office would ever have been; and without that training, you 
could have followed no other suitable occupation. 
What you have already wanted until now has been a set, 
steady, constant purpose. I therefore exhort you to persevere 
in a thorough determination to do whatever you have to do 
as well as you can do it. I was not so old as you are now 
when I first had to win my food, and do this out of this de- 
termination, and I have never slackened in it since. 
Never take a mean advantage of anyone in any transaction, 
and never be hard upon people who are in your power. Try 
to do to others, as you would have them do to you, and do not 
be discouraged if they fail sometimes. It is much better for 
you that they should fail in obeying the greatest rule laid 
down by our Saviour, than that you should. 
I put a New Testament among your books, for the very same 
reasons, and with the very same hopes that made me write 
an easy account of it for you, when you were a little child; 
because it is the best book that ever was or will be known in 
the world, and because it teaches you the best lessons by which 
any human creature who tries to be truthful and faithful to 
89 
   
-P-A-G-E-110

duty can possibly be guided. As your brothers have gone 
away, one by one, I have written to each such words as I am 
now writing you, and have entreated them all to guide them- 
selves by this book, putting aside the interpretations and in- 
ventions of men. 
You will remember that you have never at home been 
wearied about religious observances or mere formalities. I have 
always been anxious not to weary my children with such things 
before they are old enough to form opinions respecting them. 
You will therefore understand the better that I now most sol- 
emnly impress upon you the truth and beauty of the Christian 
religion, as it came from Christ himself, and the impossibility 
of your going far wrong if you humbly but heartily respect it. 
Only one thing more on this head. The more we are in 
earnest as to feeling it, the less we are disposed to hold forth 
about it. Never abandon the wholesome practice of saying 
your own private prayers, night and morning. I have never 
abandoned it myself, and I know the comfort of it. 
I hope you will always be able to say in after life, that you 
had a kind father. You cannot show your affection for him 
so well, or make him so happy, as by doing your duty. 
Your affectionate Father

upon my word and honour they are much better worth listening 
to than Iam. So let them sing to you as hard as ever they can, 
while their sweet voices last (they will be silent when the winter 
comes); and very likely after you and I have eaten our next 
Christmas pudding and mince-pie, you and I and Uncle Harry 
may all meet together at St. James Hall; Uncle Harry to bring 
you there, to hear the “Boots”; I to receive you there, and read 
the “Boots”: and you (I hope) to applaud very much, and

Witit1AM MAKEPEACE THACKERAY (1811-1863), the English 
novelist, was born in Calcutta, India. He was educated at the 
Charterhouse School in London and at Cambridge University. 
In 1851, he visited the United States on a lecturing tour. His 
winning personality and social gifts made him a general 
favorite, and he thoroughly enjoyed the hospitality he received 
in America. He was a frequent visitor at the home of the 
Baxter family of New York City; and he remembered their 
kindness with pleasure and appreciation as long as he lived. 
Many interesting letters passed between the family at the 
“Brown House” and Thackeray after his return to England.

TO LUCY BAXTER 
WASHINGTON, 
Saturday, Feb. 19, 1853. 
My Dear LittLe Kinp Lucy: 
I began to write you a letter in the railroad yesterday, but 
it bumped with more than ordinary violence, and I was forced 
to give up the endeavor. I did not know how ill Lucy was at 
that time, only remembered that I owed her a letter for that 
pretty one you wrote me at Philadelphia, when Sarah was sick 
and you acted as her Secretary. Is there going to be always 
Somebody sick at the brown house? If I were to come there 
now, I wonder should I be allowed to come and see you in 
your night-cap*—I wonder even do you wear a night- cap? I 
should step up, take your little hand, which I daresay is ly- 
ing outside the coverlet, give it a little shake; and then sit 
down and talk all sorts of stuff and nonsense to you for half 
an hour; but very kind and gentle, not so as to make you laugh 
too much or your little back ache any more. Did I not tell 
you to leave off that beecely jimnayshum? I am always giv- 
ing fine advice to girls in brown houses, and they always keep 
on never minding. It is not difficult to write lying in bed—this 
is written not in bed, but on a sofa. If you write the upright 
hand it’s quite easy; slantingdicular is not so pleasant, though. 
I have just come back from Baltimore and find your mother’s 
and sister’s melancholy letters. I thought to myself, perhaps 
I might see them on this very sofa and pictured to myself 
their two kind faces. Mr. Crampton was going to ask them 
to dinner, I had made arrangements to get Sarah nice partners 
at the ball—Why did dear little Lucy tumble down at the Gym- 
nasium? Many a pretty plan in life tumbles down so, Miss

Lucy, and falls on its back. But the good of being ill is to 
find how kind one’s friends are; of being at a pinch (I do not 
know whether I may use the expression—whether “pinch”’ is 
an indelicate word in this country; it is used by our old writ- 
ers to signify poverty, narrow circumstances, res angusta)— 
the good of being poor, I say, is to find friends to help you. 
I have been both ill and poor, and found, thank God! such 
consolation in those evils; and I daresay at this moment, now 
you are laid up, you are the person of the most importance in 
the whole house—Sarah is sliding about the room with cordials 
in her hands and eyes; Libby is sitting quite disconsolate by 
the bed (poor Libby! when one little bird fell off the perch, 
I wonder the other did not go up and fall off, too!); the ex- 
pression of sympathy in Ben’s eyes is perfectly heart-rending; 
even George is quiet; and your Father, Mother and Uncle (all 
so notorious for their violence of temper and language) have 
actually forgotten to scold. “Ach, du lieber Himmel,” says 
Herr Strumpf—isn’t his name Herr Strumpf?—the German 
master, “die schone Fraulein ist krank!’’ and bursts into tears 
on the Pianofortyfier’s shoulder when they hear the news 
(through his sobs) from black John. 
But even if Miss Lucy had not had her fall, I daresay there 
would have been no party. Here is a great snow-storm falling, 
though yestérday was as bland and bright as May (English 
May, I mean) and how could we have lionized Baltimore, and 
gone to Mount Vernon, and taken our diversion in the snow? 
There would have been nothing for it but to stay in this little 
closet of a room, where there is scarce room for 6 people, 
and where it is not near so comfortable as the brown house. 
Dear old b. h., shall I see it again soon? I shall not go 
farther than Charleston, and Savannah probably, and then I 
hope I shall get another look at you all again before I com- 
mence farther wanderings—O, stop! I didn’t tell you why I

was going to write you—well, I went on Thursday to dine with 
Governor and Mrs. Fish, a dinner in honor of me—and before 
I went I arrayed myself in a certain white garment of which 
the collar-button-holes had been altered, and I thought of the 
kind, friendly little hand that had done that deed for me; and 
when the Fisheses told me how they lived in the Second 
Avenue (I had forgotten all about ’em)—their house and the 
house opposite came back to my mind, and I liked them 50 
times better for living near some friends of mine. She is a 
nice woman, Madam Fish, besides; and did n’t I abuse you all 
to her? Good bye, dear little Lucy—lI wish the paper was n’t 
full. But I have been sitting half an hour by the poor young 
lady’s sofa, and talking stuff and nonsense, haven’t I? And 
now I get up, and shake your hand with a God bless you! 
and walk down stairs, and please to give everybody my kindest 
regards, and remember that I am truly your friend.

WiLtiAM Frenp De Morcan (1839-1917) was an artist, a 
maker of exquisite stained glass, and pottery of marvellous 
color and design. He was a close friend of Edward Burne- 
Jones, William Morris, and Dante Gabriel Rossetti. Evelyn 
Pickering, his wife, was also an artist of rare talent. When 
sixty-seven years of age, De Morgan published his first novel, 
Joseph Vance, which was followed by several others,—gentle, 
tender chronicles of daily life, full of humor and pathetic charm, 
that linger in the memory like old friends. One of our letters 
shows him in the eighties, on a merry house-boat voyage which 
he gaily describes to the little daughter of Sir Edward Burne- 
Jones, the painter. For many years his home was in that part 
of London called Chelsea, which is so rich in its associations 
with literary and artistic people.

My Dear LITTLE MArcot,— 
As to writing an account of our most eventful voyage—how 
can I? It would take all the columns of a copy of the Daily 
Telegraph. Besides I can’t remember one thing from 
another— 
Very generally speaking, I did not exert myself at all to do 
  PE 2 8 Otte 4 
anything, but I exerted everybody else very much indeed. I 
lay in the boat engaged in the manufacture of puns and bad 
jokes, and every one else rowed and steered and pushed and 
slapped and pinched the boats to make them go. 
Our boat had one sail (which we did n’t use) and the helms- 
man never looked particularly pale, at least till the end of the 
voyage, when several characters strange to say, were unwell,

this was because they towed the boats and got squeezed—I 
can tell you when a chap tries to tow, he gets exactly like 
curried fowls in tins, inside, owing to the compression. 
We set sail from Hammersmith as ’twer on Tuesday and 
arrived here so to speak on Monday. We slept at Sunbury on 
Tuesday, and were waked by a cock-a-doodle, but would n’t 
say doo! 
There were once seven towns built by the inhabitants of 
Sunbury—it was the first thing built—Monbury and Tuesbury 
are extinct—Wednesbury still exists—Thursbury not—Fri- 
bury is in Switzerland where natives call it Fribourg-en-Swisse, 
but that is because they are foreigners and cannot help it— 
Saturbury was never finished owing to the half-holiday. 
Our next station was Windsor, where the Castle is too large 
to move, but large enough to take the Queen for all that, and 
any number of Bishops and Knights into the bargain. 
I looked for Newton, but I could n’t see him— 
Eton is a pretty place, it is called so after the fish which 
are eaten there— 
Then we came to Great Marlowe, which reminded us of 
little Margot. 
We stayed at the Complete Angler. It is called so after 
an Angle of 360° in the immediate neighbourhood. We saw 
- the Obtuse Angler staying there. 
Then came Sonning—a very pretty crib—it is so called 
from the French sonner, to ring a bell, because we rang the 
bell so often for things. 
The next place was Wallingford, scilicet Wailingfold, be- 
cause the bill was very high and we lamented—and a very silly 
set we were not to ask beforehand what inn to go to— 
The next was Oxford, when in spite of Mr. Morris’s dread- 
ful revolutionary sentiments we slept in the King’s Arms.

wrote that pretty poem. We nearly got drowned getting 
through Radcote Bridge—some strong language was_ used, 
but I name no names. It is very difficult going uphill 
through Bridges. 
However, we are all safe and sound after many perils past. 
We didn’t finish the ham and we have still got 12 pounds of 
the cheese—four bottles of the champagne arrived safe—the 
remainder was gone, and we cannot account for it.

Even in childhood, both William De Morgan and his sister 
Alice displayed vivid imaginations which their mother, did not 
discourage in spite of her great reverence for truth: 
“When I walked out with the children one day,” Mrs. De 
Morgan related, “I induced Willie to walk instead of being 
carried, by pretending that we were people travelling through a 
strange country in which we met all kinds of wild animals, 
cats were panthers, horses—lions and dogs—tigers, etc. Janey 
[the nurse] told me that yesterday they were talking so loud 
about these beasts that a lady stopped in amazement and looked 
at them. Willie was in the middle of some history of a tiger 
running by the carriage when Alice exclaimed—‘Look, Bill, 
here’s four giants riding upon them and’—suddenly observing 
the lady who was looking surprised—‘there’s a giantess 
standing by!’ 
‘They carry out the ‘make-believe’ principle so far that they 
sometimes come running out of my room into the nursery 
looking quite pale and frightened. When asked what is the 
matter it is sometimes a ‘peten’ [pretence] wolf or a ‘peten’ 
bear—occasionally a peten Guy Pox; and once when Billy 
was looking very much alarmed, he answered our inquiries by 
saying, ‘I’m frightened of my shadow!’ ”

Ropert SoutHEy (1774-1843) was an English writer of po- 
etry and prose. He lived in the region of England known as 
the Lake Country. The marvellous beauty of these far-famed 
mountains and lakes gave inspiration to his poetry, as it did to 
that of Coleridge and Wordsworth, who were his friends. 
Most children are familiar with The Inchcape Rock, After 
Blenheim, and How the Water Comes Down at Lodore. He 
was truly gifted in the art of letter-writing; and none of his 
more ambitious writings are more delightful than these mes- 
sages to his friends. Those to his little daughters, and to 
Cuthbert, his only son, must have gladdened the hearts of the 
children when they received them. 
1. TO HIS DAUGHTERS 
June 26, 1820. 
Bertha, Kate, and Isabel, you have been very good girls, and 
have written me very nice letters, with which I was very much 
pleased. This is the last letter which I can write in return; 
and as I happen to have a quiet hour to myself, here at 
Streatham, on Monday noon, I will employ that hour in re- 
lating to you the whole history and manner of my being ell- 
ell-deed at Oxford by the Vice-Chancellor. 
You must know, then, that because I had written a great 
many good books, and more especially the Life of Wesley, it 
was made known to me by the Vice-Chancellor, through Mr. 
Heber, that the University of Oxford were desirous of showing 
me the only mark of honour in their power to bestow, which 
was that of making me an LL.D., that is to say, a doctor of 
laws. 
100 
 
-P-A-G-E-125
  BRITISH LETTER-WRITERS 
Now, you are to know that some persons are ell-ell-deed every 
year at Oxford, at the great annual meeting which is called 
the Commemoration. There are two reasons for this; first, 
that the university may do itself honour, by bringing persons 
of distinction to receive the degree publicly as a mark of hon- 
our; and, secondly, that certain persons in inferior offices may 
share in the fees paid by those upon whom the ceremony of 
ell-ell-deeing is performed. For the first of these reasons the 
Emperor Alexander was made a Doctor of Laws at Oxford, 
the King of Prussia, and old Blucher, and Platoff. And for 
the second, the same degree is conferred upon noblemen, and 
persons of fortune and consideration who are any ways con- 
nected with the university, or city, or county of Oxford. 
The ceremony of ell-ell-deeing is performed in a large 
circular building called the theatre, of which I will show you 
a print when I return, and this theatre is filled with people. 
The undergraduates (that is, the young men who are called 
Cathedrals at Keswick) entirely fill the gallery. Under the 
gallery there are seats, which are filled with ladies in full 
dress, separated from the gentlemen. Between these two 
divisions of the ladies are seats for the heads of houses, and 
the doctors of law, physic, and divinity. In the middle of these 
seats is the Vice-Chancellor, opposite the entrance which is 
under the orchestra. On the right and left are two kinds of 
pulpits, from which the prize essays and poems are recited. 
The area, or middle of the theatre, is filled with bachelors and 
masters of arts, and with as many strangers as can obtain ad- 
mission. Before the steps which lead up to the seats of the 
doctors, and directly in front of the Vice-Chancellor, a 
wooden bar is let down, covered with red cloth, and on each 
side of this the beadles stand in their robes. 
When the theatre is full, the Vice-Chancellor, and the heads 
of houses, and the doctors enter: those persons who are to be 
101 
 
-P-A-G-E-126
  A BOOK OF LETTERS 
ell-ell-deed remain without in the divinity schools, in their 
robes, till the convocation have signified their assent to the 
ell-ell-deeing, and then they are led into the theatre, one after 
another in a line, into the middle of the area, the people just 
making a lane for them. The professor of civil law, Dr. 
Phillimore, went before, and made a long speech in Latin, 
telling the Vice-Chancellor and the dignissimi doctores what 
excellent persons we were who were now to be ell-ell-deed. 
Then he took us one by one by the hand, and presented each 
in his turn, pronouncing his name aloud, saying who and what 
he was, and calling him many laudatory names ending in 
issimus. ‘The audience then cheered loudly to show their ap- 
probation of the person; the Vice-Chancellor stood up, and re- 
peating the first words in issime, ell-ell-deed him; the beadles 
lifted up the bar of separation, and the new-made doctor went 
up the steps and took his seat among the dignissimi doctores. 
Oh, Bertha, Kate, and Isabel, if you had seen me that day! 
I was like other issimis, dressed in a great robe of the finest 
scarlet cloth, with sleeves of rose-coloured silk, and I had in 
my hand a black velvet cap like a beefeater, for the use of 
which dress I paid one guinea for that day. Dr. Phillimore, 
who was an old school-fellow of mine, and a very good man, 
took me by the hand in my turn, and presented me; upon which 
there was a great clapping of hands and huzzaing at my name. 
When that was over, the Vice-Chancellor stood up, and said 
these words whereby I was ell-ell-deed:—“Doctissime et orna- 
tissime vir, ego, pro auctoritate mea et totius universitatis hujus, 
admitto te ad gradum doctoris in jure civili, honoris causa.” 
There were the words which ell-ell-deed me; and then the bar 
was lifted up, and I seated myself among the doctors. 
Little girls, you know it might be proper for me, now, to 
wear a large wig, and to be called Doctor Southey, and to be- 
come very severe, and leave off being a comical papa. And 
if you should find that ell-ell-deeing has made this difference

2. TO HIS SON, CUTHBERT. SOUTHEY 
LEYDEN, July 2, 1825. 
My DEar CUTHBERT, 
I have a present for you from Lodowijk Willem Bilderdijk, 
a very nice, good boy, who is of the age of your sister Isabel. 
It is a book of Dutch verses, which you and I will read to- 
gether when I come home. When he was a little boy and was 
learning to write, his father, who is very much such a father 
as I am, made little verses for him to write in his copy-book; 
and these verses pleased some good people so much, that leave 
was asked to print them. They were printed from Lodowijk’s 
writing, and have been thought so fit for the purpose, that a 
great many of them have been sold. Lodowijk will write his 
name and yours in the book. He is a very gentle, good boy, 
and I hope that one of these days somewhere or other he and 
you may meet. 
I must tell you about his stork. You should know that 
there are a great many storks in this country, and that it is 
thought a very wicked thing to hurt them. They make their 
nests, which are as large as a great clothes basket, upon the 
houses and churches, and frequently where a house or church 
is built, a wooden frame is made on the top for the storks to 
build in. Out of one of these nests a young stork had fallen, 
and somebody, wishing to keep him in a garden, cut one of 
his wings. ‘The stork tried to fly, but fell in Mr. Bilderdijk’s 
garden, and was found there one morning almost dead; his 
103

legs and his bill had lost their color, and were grown pale, and 
he would soon have died if Mrs. Bilderdijk, who is kind to 
every body and every thing, had not taken care of him, as we 
do of the dumbeldores when they have been in the house all 
night. She gave him food, and he recovered. ‘The first night 
they put him into a sort of summer-house in the garden, which 
I can not describe to you, because I have not yet been there; 
the second night he walked to the door himself that it might be 
opened for him. He was very fond of Lodowijk, and Lodowijk 
was as fond of his oyevaar, which is the name for stork in 
Dutch, though I am not sure that I have spelled it rightly, and 
they used to play together in such a manner that his father 
says it was a pleasure to see them; for a stork is a large bird, 
tall and upright, almost as tall as you are, or quite. The 
oyevaar was a bad gardener; he ate snails, but with his great 
broad foot he did a great deal of mischief, and destroyed all 
the strawberries and many of the smaller vegetables. But Mr. 
and Mrs. Bilderdijk did not mind this, because the oyevaar 
loved Lodowijk, and therefore they loved the oyevaar, and 
sometimes they used to send a mile out of town to buy eels for 
him, when none could be had in Leyden. 
The very day I came to their house the stork flew away. 
His wings were grown, and most likely he thought it time to 
get a wife and settle in life. Lodowijk saw him rise up in 
the air and fly away. Lodowijk was very sorry, not only be- 
cause he loved the oyevaar, but because he was afraid the 
oyevaar would not be able to get his own living, and therefore - 
would be starved. On the second evening, however, the stork 
came again and pitched upon a wall near. It was in the twi- 
light, and storks can not see at all when it is dusk; but when- 
ever Lodowijk called Oye! oye! (which was the way he used to 
call him), the oyevaar turned his head toward the sound. He 
did not come into the garden. Some fish was placed there for 
him, but in the morning he was gone, and had not eaten it;

so we suppose that he is married, and living very happily with 
his mate, and that now and then he will come and visit the 
old friends who were so good to him. 
It is very happy for me that I am in so comfortable a 
house, and with such excellently kind and good people... 
where I learn more of the literature, present and past state, 
and domestic manners of the country, than it would have been 
possible for me to do in any other manner. 
I hope you have been a good boy, and done every thing that 
you ought to do, while I'am away. When I come home you 
shall begin to read “Jacob Cats” with me. My love to your sis- 
ters and to every body else. I hope Rumpelstilzehen has re- 
covered his health, and that Miss Cat is well, and I should like 
to know whether Miss Fitzrumpel has been given away, and 
if there is another kitten. The Dutch cats do not speak ex- 
actly the same language as the English ones. I will tell you 
how they talk when I come home. 
God bless you, my dear Cuthbert! 
Your dutiful father,

. Having nothing else to do for a dismal hour or two, I sit 
down to write to you, in such rhymes as may ensue, be they 
many, be they few, according to the cue which I happen to pur- 
sue. I was obliged to stay at Llangedwin till to-day; though 
I wished to come away, Wynn would make me delay my 
departure yesterday, in order that he and I might go to see a 
place whereof he once sent a drawing to me. 
And now Ill tell you why it was proper that I should go 
thither to espy the place with mine own eye. ’T is a church in

a vale, whereby hangs a tale, how a hare being pressed by 
the dogs and much distressed, the hunters coming nigh and 
the dogs in full cry, looked about for some one to defend her, 
and saw just in time, as it now comes pat in rhyme, a saint 
of the feminine gender. 
The saint was buried there, and a figure carved with care, 
in the church-yard is shown, as being her own; but ’t is used 
for a whetstone (like the stone at our back door), till 
the pity is the more (I should say the more’s the pity, if it 
suited with my ditty), it is whetted half away—lack-a-day, 
lack-a-day ! 
They show a mammoth’s rib (was there ever such a fib?), 
as belonging to the saint Melangel. It was no use to wrangle, 
and tell the simple people, that if this had been her bone, she 
must certainly have grown to be three times as tall as the 
steeple. 
Moreover, there is shown a monumental stone, as being the 
tomb of Yorwerth Drwndwn (w, you must know, served in 
Welsh for long 0). In the portfolio there are drawings of 
their tombs, and of the church also. This Yorwerth was killed 
six hundred years ago. Nevertheless, as perhaps you may 
guess, he happened to be an acquaintance of mine, and there- 
fore I always have had a design to pay him a visit whenever 
I could and now the intention is at last made good. 
God bless you!

TO HIS SON, WILLIAM 
My Dear LITTLE FELLow, 
You are now going to settle at school, and may consider this 
as your first entrance into the world. As my health is so indif- 
ferent, and I may not be with you long, I wish to leave you 
some advice (the best I can) for your conduct in life, both 
that it may be of use to you, and as something to remember me 
by. I may at least be able to caution you against my own 
errors, if nothing else. 
As we went along to your new place of destination, you 
often repeated that you durst say that they were a set of stupid 
disagreeable people, meaning the people at the school. You 
were to blame in this. It is a good old rule to hope for the best. 
Always, my dear, believe things to be right till you find them 
the contrary; and even then, instead of irritating yourself 
against them, endeavor to put up with them as well as you can, 
if you cannot alter them. You said you were sure you should 
not like the school where you were going. This was wrong. 
What you meant was that you did not like to leave home. But 
you could not tell whether you should like the school or not, till 
you had given it a trial. Otherwise, your saying that you 
should not like it was determining that you would not like it. 
Never anticipate evils; or, because you cannot have things ex- 
actly as you wish, make them out worse than they are, through 
mere spite and wilfulness. 
You seemed at first to take no notice of your schoolfellows, 
or rather to set yourself against them, because they were stran- 
gers to you. They knew as little of you as you did of them; 
so that this would have been a reason for their keeping aloof 
from you as well, which you would have felt as a hardship. 
107  
-P-A-G-E-132
  A BOOK OF LETTERS 
Learn never to conceive a prejudice against others because you 
know nothing of them. It is bad reasoning, and makes en- 
emies of half the world. Do not think ill of them till they 
behave ill to you; and then strive to avoid the faults which 
you see in them. This will disarm their hostility sooner than 
pique or resentment or complaint. 
I thought you were disposed to criticize the dress of some of 
the boys as not so good as your own. Never despise anyone for 
anything that he cannot help—least of all, for his poverty. 
I would wish you to keep up appearances yourself as a de- 
fence against the idle sneers of the world, but I would not have 
you value yourself upon them. I hope you will neither be the 
dupe nor victim of vulgar prejudices. Instead of saying above, 
‘“‘Never despise anyone for anything that he cannot help,” I 
might have said, ‘‘Never despise anyone at all’’; for contempt 
implies a triumph over and pleasure in the ill of another. It 
means that you are glad and congratulate yourself on their 
failings or misfortunes. 
You complain since, that the boys laugh at you and do not 
care about you, and that you are not treated as you were at 
home. My dear, that is one chief reason for you being sent 
to school, to inure you betimes to the unavoidable rubs and un- 
certain reception you may meet with in life. You cannot al- 
ways be with me, and perhaps it is as well that you cannot. 
But you must not expect others to show the same concern about 
you as I should. You have hitherto been a spoiled child, and 
have been used to have your own way a good deal, both in 
the house and among your playfellows, with whom you were 
too fond of being a leader; but you have good-nature and 
good sense, and will get the better of this in time. You have 
now got among other boys who are your equals, or bigger and 
stronger than yourself, and who have something else to attend 
to besides humouring your whims and fancies, and you feel 
this as a repulse or piece of injustice. But the first lesson to 
108 
 
-P-A-G-E-133
    BRITISH LETTER-WRITERS 
learn is that there are other people in the world besides 
yourself, 
There are a number of boys in the school where you are, 
whose amusements and pursuits (whatever they may be) are 
and ought to be of as much consequence to them as yours can 
be to you, and to which therefore you must give way in your 
turn. The more airs of childish self-importance you give your- 
self, you will only expose yourself to be the more thwarted and 
laughed at. True equality is the only true morality or true 
wisdom. Remember always that you are but one among others, 
and you can hardly mistake your place in society. In your 
father’s house you might do as you pleased: in the world you 
will find competitors at every turn. You are not born a king’s 
son, to destroy or dictate to millions: you can only expect to 
share their fate, or settle your differences amicably with them. 
You already find it so at school, and I wish you to be reconciled 
to your situation as soon and with as little pain as you can... . 
I observe that you have got a way of speaking of your school- 
fellows as “that Hoare, that Harris,’ and so on, as if you 
meant to mark them out for particular reprobation, or did not 
think them good enough for you. It is a bad habit to speak 
disrespectfully of others; for it will lead you to think and feel 
uncharitably towards them. [Ill names beget ill blood. Even 
where there may be some repeated trifling provocation, it is 
better to be courteous, mild, and forbearing, than captious, im- 
patient, and fretful. The faults of others too often arise out of 
our own ill-temper; or though they should be real, we shall not 
mend them by exasperating ourselves against them. Treat 
your playmates, as Hamlet advises Polonius to treat the players, 
“according to your own dignity rather than their deserts.” If 
you fly out at everything in them that you disapprove or think 
done on purpose to annoy you, you lie constantly at the mercy 
of their caprice, rudeness, or ill-nature. You should be more 
your own master. ...

SypNEy SmiITH (1771-1845), the English clergyman and 
humorist, was, with Lord Jeffrey, one of the founders of the 
Edinburg Review. A man of great talents, he spent many 
years of his life in the remote Yorkshire village of Foston; 
but, adapting himself bravely to circumstances, he endeared 
himself to his parishoners, and was the life and soul of his 
own household. During an absence from home, his eight-year 
old daughter Saba gravely remarked, “A family doesn’t 
prosper, I see, without a papa.” In after years he held a 
position of honor and responsibility in London. Little Saba 
was then Lady Holland, and at her home, his genial and witty 
presence added much to the brilliant gatherings. His letters 
were always delightful and full of humor. To his son Douglas 
then at school at Westminster in the shadow of the gray old 
abbey, he wrote from Foston Rectory. A few other letters to 
his little friends show the kindly spirit of the writer.

In the time you can give to English reading you should 
consider what it is most needful to have, what it is most shame- 
ful to want—shirts and stockings, before frills and collars. 
Such is the history of your own country, to be studied in Hume, 
then in Rapin’s History of England, with Tindal’s Continu- 
ation. Hume takes you to the end of James the Second, Rapin 
and Tindal will carry you to the end of Anne. Then Coxe’s 
Life of Sir Robert Walpole, and the Duke of Mariborough; 
and these read with attention to dates and geography. Then 
the history of the other three or four enlightened nations in 
Europe. For the English poets, I will let you off at present 
with Milton, Dryden, Pope and Shakspeare; and remember, al- 
ways, in books, keep the best company. Don’t read a line of 
Ovid till you have mastered Virgil; nor a line of Thomson till 
you have exhausted Pope; nor of Massinger till you are famil- 
lar with Shakspeare. 
I am glad you liked your box and its contents. Think of us 
as we think of you; and send us the most acceptable of all 
presents—the information that you are improving in all 
particulars. 
The greatest of human mysteries are the Westminster holi- 
days. If you can get a peep behind the curtain, pray let us 
know immediately the day of your coming home. 
We have had about three or four ounces of rain here, that is 
all. I heard of your being wet through in London, and envied 
you very much. The whole of this parish is pulverized from 
long and excessive drought. Our whole property depends upon 
the tranquillity of the winds: if it blows before it rains, we 
shall all be up in the air in the shape of dust, and shall be 
transparished we know ‘not where.

Lydiard.

Lucy, Lucy, my dear child, don’t tear your frock: tearing 
frocks is not of itself a proof of genius; but write as your 
mother writes, act as your mother acts; be frank, loyal, af- 
fectionate, simple, honest; and then integrity or laceration of 
- frock is of little import. 
And Lucy, dear child, mind your arithmetic. You know, 
in the first sum of yours I ever saw, there was a mistake. You 
had carried two (as a cab is licensed to do) and you ought, dear 
Lucy, to have carried but one. Is this a trifle? What would 
life be without arithmetic, but a scene of horrors? 
You are going to Boulogne, the city of debts, peopled by men 
who never understood arithmetic; by the time you return, I 
shall probably have received my first paralytic stroke, and shall 
have lost all recollection of you; therefore I now give you my

Arter the death of Thomas Hood (1799-1845), his son and 
daughter gathered together his letters, and made them part of a 
charming life-story of one of the most lovable men in literature. 
It is the story of a struggle against poor health and insufficient 
means, faced bravely and cheerfully until the end. We know 
Thomas Hood best for his poems, The Song of the Shirt, 
The Bridge of Sighs, The Dream of Eugene Aram, and the 
exquisite little poem,

Hood was a Londoner born, and the little house was in an 
old street called the Poultry, not far from the Bank of England. 
He was the companion and playfellow of his children, and a

Elliott, who were sometimes fortunate enough to receive one of 
his cheery, delightful letters. 
1. TO DUNNIE ELLIOTT 
DEVONSHIRE LODGE, NEW FINCHLEY Roap 
St. JoHN’s Woop 
July 1st 
My Dear DUNNEE, 
I have heard of your doings at Sandgate, and that you were 
so happy at getting to the sea, that you were obliged to be 
flogged a little to moderate it, and keep some for next day. 
I am very fond of the sea, too, though I have been twice nearly 
drowned by it; once in a storm in a ship, and once under a 
boat’s bottom when I was bathing. Of course you have bathed, 
but have you learned to swim yet? It is rather easy in salt 
water, and diving is still easier, even, than at the sink. I only 
swim in fancy, and strike out new ideas! 
Is not the tide curious? Though I cannot say much for 
its tidiness; it makes such a slop and litter on the beach. It 
comes and goes as regularly as the boys of a proprietary school, 
but has no holidays. And what a rattle the waves make with 
the stones when they are rough; you will find some rolled into 
decent marbles and bounces: and sometimes you may hear the 
sound of a heavy sea, at a distance, like a giant snoring. Some 
people say that every ninth wave is bigger than the rest. I 
have often counted, but never found it come true, except with 
tailors, of whom every ninth is a man. But in rough weather 
114

there are giant waves, bigger than the rest, that come in trios, 
from which I suppose, Britannia rules the waves by the rule 
of three. When I was a boy, I loved to play with the sea, in 
spite of its sometimes getting rather rough. I and my brother 
chucked hundreds of stones into it, as you do; but we came 
away before we could fill it up. In those days we were at 
war with France. Unluckily, it’s peace now, or with so many 
stones you might have good fun for days in pelting the enemy’s 
coast. Once I almost thought I nearly hit Boney! Then there 
was looking for an island like Robinson Crusoe! Have you 
ever found one yet, surrounded by water? I remember once . 
staying on the beach, when the tide was flowing, till I was. 
a peninsula, and only by running turned myself into a 
continent. 
By this time, I suppose, you are become, instead of a land- 
boy, a regular sea-urchin; and so amphibious, that you can 
walk on the land as well as on the water—or better. And 
don’t you mean, when you grow up, to go to sea? Should you 
not like to be a little midshipman? Or half a quarter-master, 
with a cocked hat, and a dirk, that will be a sword by the time 
you are a man? _ If you do resolve to be a post-captain, let me 
know; and I will endeavour through my interest with the Com- 
missioners of Pavements, to get you a post to jump over of the 
proper height. ‘Tom is just rigging a boat, so I suppose that 
he inclines to be an Admiral of the Marines. But before you 
decide, remember the port holes, and that there are great guns 
in those battle-doors, that will blow. you into shuttle-cocks, 
which is a worse game than whoop and hide—as to a good 
hiding! | 
And so farewell, young “Old Fellow,” and take care of your- 
self so near the sea, for in some places, they say, it has not even 
a bottom to go to if you fall in. And remember when you are

Monday, April, 1844. 
My Dear May, 
I promised you a letter, and here it is. I was sure to 
remember it; for you are as hard to forget, as you are soft to 
roll down a hill with. What fun it was! only so prickly, I 
thought I had a porcupine in one pocket, and a hedgehog in 
the other. The next time, before we kiss the earth, we will have 
its face shaved well. Did you ever go to Greenwich Fair? 
I should like to go there with you, for I get no rolling in St. 
John’s Wood. Tom and Fanny like only roll and butter, and 
as for Mrs. Hood, she is for rolling in money. 
Tell Dunnie that Tom has set his trap in the balcony and 
has caught a cold, and tell Jeanie that Fanny has set her foot 
in the garden, but it has not come up yet. Oh, how I wish it 
was the season when “March winds and April showers bring 
forth May flowers!” for then of course you would give me an- 
other pretty little nosegay. Besides it is frosty and foggy 
weather, which I do not like. The other night, when I came 
from Stratford, the cold shriveled me up so, that I thought I 
was my own child!

of wine, Tom’s mouth is to have a hole holiday, and Mrs. 
Hood is to sit up for supper! There will be doings! And 
then such good things to eat; but, pray, pray, pray, mind they 
don’t boil the baby by a mistake for a plump pudding, instead

My Dear May, 
How do you do, and how do you like the sea? not much 
perhaps, it’s “so big.’? But should n’t you like a nice little 
ocean, that you could put in a pan? Yet the sea, although 
it looks rather ugly at first, is very useful, and, if 1 were near 
it this dry summer, I would carry it all home, to water the gar- 
den with at Stratford, and it would be sure to drown all the 
blights, May-flies and all! 
I remember that, when I saw the sea, it used sometimes to be 
very fussy, and fidgetty, and did not always wash itself quite 
Pda: but it was very fond of fun. Have the waves ever 
/ run after you yet, and turned your little two shoes into pumps, 
\ full of water? 
If you want a joke you might push Dunnie into the sea, 
and then fish for him as they do for a Jack. But don’t go in 
yourself, and don’t let the baby go in and swim away, although 
he is the shrimp of the family. Did you ever taste the sea-

water? ‘The fishes are so fond of it they keep drinking it all 
the day long. Dip your little finger in, and then suck it to 
see how it tastes. A glass of it warm, with sugar and a grate 
of nutmeg, would quite astonish you! The water of the sea is 
so saline, I wonder nobody catches salt fish in it. I should 
think a good way would be to go out in a butter-boat, with a 
little melted for sauce. Have you been bathed yet in the sea, 
and were you afraid? I was, the first time, and the time be- 
fore that; and dear me, how I kicked, and screamed—or, at 
least, meant to scream, but the sea, ships and all, began to 
run into my mouth, and so I shut it up. I think I see you 
being dipped in the sea, screwing your eyes up, and putting 
your nose, like a button, into your mouth, like a button-hole, 
for fear of getting another smell and taste! By the bye, did 
you ever dive your head under water with your legs up in the 
air like a duck, and try whether you could cry “Quack?” 
Some animals can! I would try, but there is no sea here, and 
so I am forced to dip into books. I wish there were such nice 
green hills here as there are at Sandgate. They must be 
very nice to roll down, especially if there are no furze bushes 
to prickle one, at the bottom! Do you remember how the thorns 
stuck in us like a penn’orth of mixed pins at Wamstead? I 
have been very ill, and am so thin now, I could stick myself 
into a prickle. My legs, in particular, are so wasted away, 
that somebody says my pins are only needles; and I am so weak, 
I dare say you could push me down on the floor and right 
through the carpet, unless it was a strong pattern. I am sure, 
if I were at Sandgate, you could carry me to the post office and 
fetch my letters. Talking of carrying, I suppose you have 
donkeys at Sandgate, and ride about on them. Mind and al- 
ways call them ‘“‘donkeys,” for if you call them asses, it might 
reach such long ears! I knew a donkey once that kicked a 
man for calling him Jack instead of John. 
There are no flowers, I suppose, on the beach, or I would ask

you to bring me a bouquet, as you used at Stratford. But 
there are little crabs! If you would catch one for me, and 
teach it to dance the Polka, it would make me quite happy; for 
I have not had any toys or playthings for a long time. Did 
you every try, like a little crab, to run two ways at once? 
See if you can do it, for it is good fun; never mind tumbling 
over yourself a little at first. It would be a good plan to hire 
a little crab, for an hour a day, to teach baby to crawl, if 
he can’t walk, and, if I was his mamma, I would too! Bless 
him! But I must not write on him any more—he is so soft, 
and I have nothing but steel pens. 
And now good-bye, Fanny has made my tea, and I must drink 
it before it gets too hot, as we all were last Sunday week. 
They say the glass was 88 in the shade, which is a great age! 
The last fair breeze I blew dozens of kisses for you, but the 
wind changed, and I am afraid took them all to Miss H 
or somebody that it should n’t. Give my love to everybody and 
my compliments to all the rest, and remember, I am, my dear 
May, your loving friend,   
Tuomas Hoop 
P.S. Don’t forget my little crab to dance the Polka, and pray 
write to me as soon as you can’t, if it’s only a line.

Tue life of Walter Savage Landor (1775-1864) was a suc- 
cession of stormy episodes. ~ He was hot-tempered, impetuous, 
sensitive, and impatient of all restraint, but warm-hearted and 
generous, and much loved by those who understood him. He 
wrote poetry which never became popular, but was highly ap- 
preciated by the literary men of his time, and has a recognized 
place in literature. His letters are especially interesting, re- 
vealing, as they do, the personality of the man. He had many

was passionately devoted to his own children, Julia and Arnold.

My Drarest ARNOLD, 
I received your letter to-day much too late to answer it by 
the post; but you will see that I was thinking of you and of 
Julia yesterday by the verses I send you on the other side. 
I am very much pleased to observe that you write better than 
I do; and, if you continue to read the Greek nouns, you will 
very soon know more Greek [than I], unless I begin again to 
study it every day. When I was a little boy I did not let any 
one get before me; and you seem as if you would do the same. 
I promised you a Greek book, but I will give you two if you go 
on well, and next year two others, very beautiful and enter- 
taining. I shall never be quite happy until I see you again 
and put my cheek upon your head. Tell my sweet Julia that, 
if I see twenty little girls, I will not romp with any of them

me. You must always love them as much as I love you, and 
you must teach them how to be good boys, which I cannot do 
so well as you can. God preserve and bless you, my own 
Arnold. My heart beats as if it would fly to you, my own 
fierce creature. We shall very soon meet.

Tue great ability of Thomas Babington Macaulay (1800- 
1859) revealed itself early in his remarkable childhood. At 
three, he is said to have begun to read extensively and, not 
many years later, to write on various subjects, including history. 
In after life, his career as statesman, essayist, historian, and 
poet fulfilled the promise of his early years. Among his best- 
known works are his Essays, his History of England, and 
his Lays of Ancient Rome. The letter to his little niece 
shows how admirably he could adapt his great gifts to the 
needs of a little child. 
TO HIS NIECE 
September 15th, 1842. 
My Dear Basa: 
Thanks for your very pretty letter. I am always glad to 
make my little girl happy, and nothing pleases me so much as 
to see that she likes books. For, when she is as old as I am, 
she will find that they are better than all the tarts and cakes, 
and toys, and plays and sights in the world. If anybody 
would make me the greatest king that ever lived, with palace, 
and gardens, and fine dinners, and wine, and coaches, and 
121

beautiful clothes, and hundreds of servants, on condition that 
I would not read books, I would not be a king. I would rather 
be a poor man in a garret with plenty of books, than a king 
who did not love reading. 
Your affectionate uncle,

For many years the eminent Scottish jurist, Lord Francis 
Jeffrey (1773-1850), edited the Edinburgh Review. He was a 
severe critic of the writers of his day, especially the poets, 
among whom were Wordsworth and Byron. But his skilful 
pen could write merrily and tenderly, as we see in the two 
letters about the birthdays of the same little maiden, Maggie, 
his granddaughter. From his gray castle in the north country, 
he writes in happy expectation of that birthday, now so long 
ago, and of the gay party around the bonfire on that mid- 
summer night when the pale light would linger in the sky till 
morning. 
1. TO HIS GRANDCHILD, MAGGIE 
CRAIGCROOK, 21st June, 1847. 
A high day! and a holiday! the longest and the brightest of 
the year! the very middle day of the summer—and the very 
day when Maggie first opened her sweet eyes on the light! 
Bless you ever, my darling, and bonny bairn. You have now 
blossomed beside us for six pleasant years and been all that 
time the light of our eyes, and the love of our hearts—at first 
the cause of some tender fears from your own weakness and 
delicacy—then of some little provocation from your too great 
love, as we thought, of your own will and amusement—but 
122 
 
-P-A-G-E-147
BRITISH LETTER-WRITERS 
now only of love and admiration for your gentle obedience to 
your parents, and the sweet yielding to the wishes of your 
younger sister and brother. God bless and keep you then 
for ever, my delightful and ever improving child, and make 
you, not only gay and happy, as an angel without sin and sor- 
row, but meek and mild, like that heavenly child, who was 
once sent down to earth for our example. 
Well, the sun is shining brightly on our towers and trees, 
and the great bonfire is all piled up and ready to be lighted, 
when we come out after drinking your health at dinner; and 
we have got a great blue and yellow flag hung out on the 
tower, waving proudly in the wind and telling all the coun- 
try around, that this is a day of rejoicing and thanksgiving, 
and wishes of happiness, with all who live under its shadow. 
And the servants are all to have a fine dinner, and wine and 
whisky to drink to your health, and all the young Christies 
(that is, the new gardener’s children,) will be taught to re- 
peat your name with blessings; and, when they are drawn up 
round the bonfire, will wonder a little, I daresay, what sort of 
a creature this Miss Maggie can be, that we are making all 
this fuss about! and so you must take care, when you come, 
to be good enough, and pretty enough, to make them understand 
why we all so love and honour you. 
Frankie and Tarley have been talking a great deal about 
you this morning already, and Granny is going to take them 
and Maggie Rutherfurd and her brother down to the sea at 
Cramond—that they may tell the fishes and the distant shores 
what a happy and hopeful day it is to them, and to us all. 
And so bless you again, my sweet one, for this and all future 
years. Think kindly of one who thinks always of you; and 
believe, that of all who love you, there is none who has loved 
you better or longer, or more constantly, than your loving

2. TO HIS GRANDDAUGHTER 
CRAIGCROOK, June 20, 1848. 
My Sonsy Nancy! 
I love you very much, and think very often of your dimples, 
and your pimples, and your funny little plays, and all your 
pretty ways; and I send you my blessing and wish I were 
kissing, your sweet rosy lips, or your fat finger-tips; and that 
you were here, so that I could hear you stammering words, from 
a mouthful of curds; and a great purple tongue (as broad as it’s 
long); and see your round eyes, open wide with surprise, and 
your wondering look to find yourself at Craigcrook! To- 
morrow is Maggie’s birthday, and we have built up a great bon- 
fire in honour of it; and Maggie Rutherfurd (do you remember 
her at all?) is coming out to dance round it; and all the 
servants are to drink her health, and wish her many happy 
days with you and Frankie,—and all the mammys and pappys, 
whether grand or not grand. We are very glad to hear that she 
and you love each other so well, and are happy in making each 
other happy; and that you do not forget dear Tarley or Frankie, 
when they are out of sight, nor Granny either,—or even old 
Granny pa, who is in most danger of being forgotten, he thinks. 
We have had showery weather here, but the garden is full of 
flowers; and Frankie has a new wheel-barrow, and does a 
great deal of work, and some mischief now and then. All 
the dogs are very well; and Foxey is mine, and Froggy is 
Tarley’s, and Frankie has taken up with great white Neddy,— 
so that nothing is left for Granny but old barking Jacky and 
Dover when the carriage comes. The donkey sends his com- 
pliments to you, and maintains that you are a cousin of his! 
or a near relation, at all events. He wishes, too, that you and 
Maggie would come; for he thinks that you will not be so

heavy on his back as Tarley and Maggie Rutherfurd, who now 
ride him without mercy. 
This is Sunday, and Ali is at church—Granny and I tak- 
ing care of Frankie till she comes back, and he is now hammer- 
ing very busily at a corner of the carpet, which he says does 
not lie flat. He is very good, and really too pretty for a boy, 
though I think his two eyebrows are growing into one,—stretch- 
ing and meeting each other above his nose! But he has not 
so many freckles as Tarley, who has a very fine crop of them, 
which she and I encourage as much as we can. I hope you 
and Maggie will lay in a stock of them, as I think no little 
girl can be pretty without them in summer. Our pea-hens are 
suspected of having young families in some hidden place, for 
though they pay us short visits now and then, we see them but 
seldom, and always alone. If you and Maggie were here with 
your sharp eyes, we think you might find out their secret, and 
introduce us to a nice new family of young peas. The old 
papa cock, in the meantime says he knows nothing about them, 
and does not care a farthing! We envy you your peas of an- 
other kind, for we have none yet, nor any asparagus neither, 
and hope you will bring some down to us in your lap. Tarley | 
sends her love, and I send mine to you all; though I shall 
think most of Maggie to-morrow morning, and of you when 
your birth morning comes. When is that do you know? It 
is never dark now here, and we might all go to bed without 
candles. And so bless you ever and ever, my dear dimply 
pussie,— 
Your very loving

Wuen Dr. John Brown (1810-1882) was told that the degree 
of LL.D. was to be conferred upon him by Edinburgh Univer-

sity, he protested that he was not worthy. A friend suggested to 
him that perhaps, in his case, LL.D. meant loved, not learned. 
This little anecdote was the keynote of his character. The 
skilled and kindly Edinburgh physician did much of his work 
without hope of financial return. He wrote little, distrusting 
his own powers; yet his writings have become classics. Rab 
and His Friends is an exquisite story of a woman’s courage, a 
man’s devotion, and a dog’s faithfulness. He has also written 
a delightful sketch of little Marjorie Fleming. Many letters 
from interesting people brightened the quiet life of the Scottish 
doctor. His own letters are original in style and expression, as 
those to his little niece Maggie clearly show.

We are going to be very happy to have you for a day; the 
bed is being lengthened and (by your Mother’s advice) 
strengthened. Charlie will meet you at the train with a cab 
and the BAND of the 196th Regiment, and you will go in 
triumph, the cab being open and warm bottles for your feet, 
along Princes Street. ‘There will (not) be a triumphal Arch 
at Rutland Street, but there will be a warm bowl of BEEF 
TEA presented to you on the threshold of No. 23, and John 
will play a March from Beethoven on the JEWS’ harp through 
the lobby, and you know you must be kind and merciful to 
us, and not frighten me; so good-bye; my love to yourself and 
to GUS. 
Your affectionate and QUEER Uncle,

Earty in the last century, the happy little family of Sir 
Walter Scott (1771-1832) were growing up at Abbotsford. 
Scott had four children, Walter, Sophia, Anne, and Charles. 
At the time these letters were written to his little daughter, his 
fame chiefly rested upon Marmion and The Lay of the Last 
Minstrel; and he was known as a lover and collector of Scottish 
lore and legend. The days when the Great Unknown was to 
give the Waverley Novels to the world were yet to come. 
These letters give us a glimpse of the private life of Scott in 
his beautiful country home and of his sons and daughters in 
their daily tasks and pleasures.

Melrose Abbey, which you must fix in your recollection, as 
we are now going to live so near it. It was founded by 
David the First, one of the best of our Scottish kings. We have 
had very cold weather here indeed, but to-day it is more fa- 
vorable. The snow and frost has prevented things getting on 
at Abbotsford so well as I could wish, but a great deal has 
been done. 
I expect to find that Walter has plied his lessons hard, and 
given satisfaction to Mr. Brown; and Ann and Charles are, I 
dare say, both very good children. You must kiss them all for 
me, and pat up little Wallace. Finette has been lame, but she 
is now quite well. I beg you will remember me to Grand- 
mamma when you see her, and also present my kind compli- 
ments and Mamma’s to Miss Miller. We are now at Mertoun, 
but return to Ashestiel to-morrow, and I think we shall be at 
home on Thursday or Friday, so the cook can have something 
ready for us—a beef-steak or mutton-chop—in case we are 
past your dinner-hour. Tell Walter I will not forget his great 
cannon, and believe me, my dear Sophia, your affectionate

Walter’s schooling. I hope that goes on well. I am sorry 
to say that poor Cuddy is no more. He lost the use of his 
hind legs, so we were obliged to have him shot, out of hu- 
manity. This will vex little Anne, but as the animal could 
never have been of the least use to her, she has the less reason

to regret his untimely death; and I will study to give her 
something that she will like as well, to make amends, namely, 
a most beautiful peacock and peahen, so tame that they come 
to the porch and feed out of the children’s hands. They were 
a present from Mertoun, and I will give them to little Anne 
to make amends for this family loss of the Donkey. I have 
got a valuable addition to the Museum, some of the hair of 
Charles I. cut from the head when his coffin was discovered 
about a month ago in St. George’s Chapel at Windsor. Dr. 
Baillie begged it for me of Sir Henry Halford, under whose 
inspection the coffin was opened. The hair is a light brown. 
This is my best news. The worst is that everything is suffer- 
ing from cold and drought. Give my kind love to Walter, 
Anne, and little Charles. I assure you the gardens are well 
looked after, but we want a little rain sadly. The Russians 
have taken Dantzick and you have escaped reading some very 
cramp gazettes, consequently a good deal of yawning.

MarjoriE FLEMING was born in 1803 in Kirkcaldy, Scotland, 
and lived barely nine years: her death occurred in 1811. She 
was the friend and favorite of Sir Walter Scott. When the 
author of Waverley could not get himself into the mood to 
compose, he would say: “I’ll awa’ to Marjorie.” And off he 
would go for Marjorie, bring her back to his study, and gravely 
try to learn the lesson she taught him:

You are,—out. 
Marjorie kept a journal in which she recorded what she said 
and did, and especially her opinions of people. Her spelling 
was original and her pen was “peppery.” She wrote an epic 
poem on Mary Queen of Scots. Here ‘is a passage from 
Marjorie’s journal: “The cassawary is a curious bird, and so 
is the gigantic crane, and the pelican of the wilderness, whose 
mouth holds a bucket of fish and water. Fighting is what 
ladies is not qualyfied for, they would not make a good figure 
in battle or ina duel. Alas! we females are of little use to our 
country.” 
The following letters are written to Marjorie’s mother and to 
her cousin, Isabella Keith.

TO MISS HONORA EDGEWORTH 
1 NortH AUDLEY STREET, January 8, 1831. 
Now I will tell you of my delightful young Christmas party 
at Mrs. Lockhart’s. After dinner she arranged a round table 
in the corner of the room, on which stood a magnificent iced 
plum cake. There were to be twelve children: impossible to 
have room for chairs all round the table: it was settled that 
the king and queen alone should be invited to the honors of 
the sitting; but Mr. Lockhart, in a low voice, said, ‘Johnny! 
there must, my dear Sophia, you know, be a chair for Johnny 
here—all ’s right now.” 
Enter first, Miss Binning, a young lady of fifteen, Johnny’s 
particular friend, who had been invited to make crowns for 
the king and queen—a very nice elegant-looking girl with a 
slight figure. 
Then came from the top of the stairs peals of merry laughter, 
and in came the revel rout; the king and queen with their gilt 
paper crowns on their heads, and little coronation robes; the 
queen was Mrs. Lockhart’s youngest child, like a dear little 
fairy; and the king to match. All the others in various ways 
pleasing and prettily, simply dressed in muslins of a variety 
of colors; plenty of ringlets of glossy hair, fair or brown, none 
black, with laughing eyes. And now they look at the tickets 
they have drawn for their Twelfth-Night characters, and read 
them out. After eating as much as well could be compassed, 
the revel rout ran upstairs again to the drawing-room, where 
open space and verge enough had been made for hunt the 
slipper, and down they all popped in the circle, of which you 
may see the likeness in the Pleasures of Memory. Then 
came dancing; and as the little and large dancers were all

Scotch, I need not say how good it was. Mrs. Lockhart is 
really a delightful creature, the more lovable the closer one 
comes to her, and in London. How very, very kind of her to 
invite me to this quiet family party; if she had invented for- 
ever, she could not have found what would please me more.

ArTHUR PENRHYN STANLEY (1815-1881), Dean of Westmin- 
ster and sometime chaplain to Queen Victoria, spent five years 
of his boyhood at Rugby in the days when Dr. Arnold was head 
master. This famous man, who has been immortalized in 
Tom Brown’s Schooldays, was one of the strongest influences 
in shaping the character of young Stanley who, in later years, 
became the biographer of the beloved master. After a brilliant 
career at Oxford, Stanley entered the church, where he was 
noted for the liberality of his views. When Stanley was thir- 
teen years old, he wrote the following letter to his sister Mary. 
TO HIS SISTER? 
Rucsy: Feb. 4, 1829. 
My Dear Mary, 
According to your wish I write to you. Nothing remarkable 
happened on the journey. . . . We had our breakfast at Dun- 
church, got into a chaise, and set off for Rugby! ‘The coun- 
try was very pretty—long sweeping meadows, and trees. I 
looked out for boys, but none were to be seen, as they were 
all in school. Presently we saw the towers of Rugby rising 
up above the trees, and a few moments after the whole school 
burst upon us in all its beauty: and beautiful it was—an im- 
mense long building, towered and turreted (very like the

print), of stone, and I don’t think it looked at all too new. 
At one end of it—joined to it, and just the same kind of build- 
ing—was Dr. Arnold’s department, and on the other the chapel, 
close to it—small and pretty, but nothing very striking. I 
must just leave off here to go to dinner. The playground is 
a fine large field, with several fine trees. We drove through 
the town, which is just behind the school, and stopped at Mr. 
Townsend’s. There we saw him and his wife. We went to 
look at the studies, some of which were ranged round a yard, 
and some upstairs; some were indeed small, but some were a 
very tolerable size, with sofas, tables, bookcases, fitted up as 
nicely as could be. Papa and I then walked to Dr. Arnold’s, 
and presently Mrs. Arnold came in—she was very nice indeed. 
At last came the doctor himself; but I certainly should not 
have taken him for a Doctor. He was very pleasant, and did 
not look old. When Papa asked him whether I could be ex- 
amined, he said that if I would walk into the next room he 
would do it himself; so, of course, in I went with a feeling 
like that when I am going to have a tooth drawn. So he 
took down a Homer, and I read about half a dozen lines, and 
the same with Virgil; he then asked a little about my Latin 
verses, and set me down without any more ado in the great 
book as placed in the fourth form. I felt such a weight taken 
off my mind when that was done. And then Papa and I 
walked to a place about two miles off, where the boys were 
skating, to inquire for Entwisle (a sixth-form boy), who soon 
appeared—a tall young man. I gave him the letter, and we 
then walked off again, and I went to Mr. Townsend’s again to 
dine with the boys. The dining-room was a place with a large 
fire, and a table with benches, on the former of which was 
placed the dinner (which consisted of pudding and meat), 
and on the latter the boys—in number about seven—and two 
men-servants to wait upon us. Not a word was passed be- 
tween me and them the whole of dinner-time. I glanced my 
135 
 
-P-A-G-E-160
  A BOOK OF LETTERS 
eye round to discover how many frill-companions I should 
have, and there was only one, and I rather think there are 
not above two more in the whole school: Pudding first, and 
then veal, and we certainly were not stinted in our allowance. 
Much laughter and joking passed among the boys, and after 
dinner one or two of them spoke to me about where I was 
placed, etc. Papa and I walked to see the new house, which 
promised to be a very pretty one; and I was then committed 
to the charge of one Howard, who was a boarder at Mr. 
Townsend’s. We walked about a little, and at a quarter to 
five I went to take leave of Papa, who dined at Dr. Arnold’s. 
We had a good tea at half-past five, when we were locked up 
from going into the streets. I sate for the rest of the evening 
with a boy of about my age whose name was Highton from 
Leicestershire. He seemed to be clever, and had a very com- 
fortable study, well stored with books—many English. My 
study was a small, comfortable room, with a table and two 
chairs; but as it was in the yard, and the boys might throw 
water or anything else in at the window, I thought it best to 
change to one upstairs. We had bread-and-cheese for sup- 
per. The bell rang for us at a quarter to ten, and at ten we 
were all in bed. Now don’t you expect some dreadful story 
of pulling toes, &c? I am afraid Mamma and you will be 
very much disappointed, for I slept very quietly all night. In 
the morning I found it was a usual custom for new boys not. 
to go to the first lesson, so I stayed at home; and, moreover, 
I discovered that it was an unknown, an unpardonable thing 
for a Rugby boy to wear a cap: so I got a note from Mrs. 
Townsend (that is, such a thing as this—‘‘Hat for Stanley— 
Mrs. Townsend”—and then it will be put down in the bill), 
and got a hat with all speed. After breakfast, at a quarter to 
ten, went with the other boys to the great schoolroom, where 
we sate construing the second lesson to one another till half- 
past ten. ... We, then, of the fourth went into a smaller 
136
-P-A-G-E-161
    BRITISH LETTER-WRITERS 
schoolroom, where Mr. Bird, the master, in his college dress, 
made first one and then another get up and construe. I was 
very much confused, but I took two or three places, and found 
myself most deficient in grammar. At half-past twelve we 
came out, and Arthur Pigot very kindly offered to walk with 
me; but as it was a wet drizzly day we soon parted. Dined 
at half-past one. . . . At a quarter-past two to school again— 
third lesson—Ovid—the same manner as before. Just let me 
notice here, without thinking it vanity, that Mr. Bird said of 
me to some of the boys: ‘That boy is only just come, but 
if you don’t mind he’ll soon be up to you.” Fourthly, and 
lastly, Greek exercises, and we came home just as the locking 
up, and calling over, and tea began; and here I am in my 
study upstairs, with the First Day over. I think the only 
misery I have endured is that this night the boys have been 
smoking me with burnt paper through the cracks in the door. 
My study is not yet what I call comfortable-looking. All the 
books are on the floor, and there is no other place to put them 
till I get my bookcase. As to collars, pray bring them with 
you, for though they are not so necessary as hats, vet I should 
like to have them very much. The first advice about my hat 
was, “Put your name in it, or you ’ll have it bagged’’—which 
means stolen; and as soon as I got to school, “Keep your books 
close, and have your name in them, or they ‘ll be bagged in a 
minute.” I heard one of the boys talking about the prizes one 
of the others had got—“‘Oh,” he said, “it was nothing—only 
Ivanhoe.” ‘Thought I to myself, If that is considered a bad 
one, what must the best be? They have three days’ holiday 
at Easter, and make speeches then. I find I shall have but 
little time. It is a very common thing for boys to sit with one 
another. 
Though I have no miseries, I feel such a sense of desolation 
sometimes—such a difference from Seaforth, where I could do 
almost what I liked—that I wish I was anywhere else. I am

In 1818, John Keats (1795-1821) and a friend set out on a 
walking tour through the English Lake country, and into Scot- 
land. On this journey, he wrote joyous letters to his brothers 
and sister, telling them all that interested and pleased him on his 
way. Keats, the writer of exquisite verse, was original and 
charming in his letters; and those written while he journeyed 
from place to place tell a pleasing story of his sight-seeing. 
His young sister, Fanny, then fourteen years old, was his 
special favorite; and his long letter to her from Dumfries is 
full of interest. 
TO FANNY KEATS 
Dumrries, July 2nd [1818]. 
My Dear FAnny, 
I intended to have written to you from Kirkcudbright, the 
town I shall be in to-morrow—but I will write now because my 
Knapsack has worn my coat in the Seams, my coat has gone 
to the Taylors sic and I have but one Coat to my back in these 
parts. I must tell you how I went to Liverpool with George 
and our new Sister and the Gentleman my fellow traveller 
through the Summer and autumn—We had a tolerable journey 
138 
 
-P-A-G-E-163
  BRITISH LETTER-WRITERS 
to Liverpool—which I left the next morning before George was 
up for Lancaster—Then we set off from Lancaster on foot with 
our Knapsacks on, and have walked a little zig zag through 
the mountains and Lakes of Cumberland and Westmoreland— 
We came from Carlisle yesterday to this place—We are em- 
ployed in going up Mountains, looking at strange towns, prying 
into old ruins and eating very hearty breakfasts. Here we 
are full in the Midst of broad Scotch ‘How is it a’ wi yoursel”’ 
—the Girls are walking about bare footed and in the worst 
cottages the smoke finds its way out of the door. I shall come 
home full of news for you and for fear I should choak you by 
too great a dose at once I must make you used to it by a letter 
or two. We have been taken for travelling Jewellers, Razor 
sellers and Spectacle vendors because friend Brown wears a 
pair—The first place we stopped at with our Knapsacks con- 
tained one Richard Bradshaw, a notorious tippler. He stood 
in the shape of a 5 and balanced himself as well as he could 
saying with his nose right in Mr. Brown’s face “Do—yo-u sell 
spect-ta-cles?’”? Mr. Abbey says we are Don Quixotes—tell 
him we are more generally taken for Pedlars. All I hope is 
that we may not be taken for excisemen in this whiskey country. 
We are generally up about 5 walking before breakfast and 
we complete our 20 miles before dinner—Yesterday we visited 
Burns’ Tomb and this morning the fine Ruins of Lincluden.— 
I had done thus far when my coat came back fortified at all 
points—so as we lose no time we set forth again through 
Galloway—all very pleasant and pretty with no fatigue when 
one is used to it—We are in the midst of Meg Merrilies’ coun- 
try of whom I suppose you have heard. 
Old Meg she was a Gipsy, 
And liv’d upon the Moors: 
Her bed it was the brown heath turf, 
And her house was out of doors. 
139 
 
-P-A-G-E-164

Her apples were swart blackberries, 
Her currants pods o’ broom; 
Her wine was dew of the wild white rose, 
Her book a churchyard tomb. 
Her Brothers were the craggy hills, 
Her Sisters larchen trees— 
Alone with her great family 
She liv’d as she did please. 
No breakfast had she many a morn, 
No dinner many a noon, 
And ’stead of supper she would stare 
Full hard against the Moon. 
But every morn of woodbine fresh 
She made her garlanding, 
And every night the dark glen Yew 
She wove, and she would sing. 
And with her fingers old and brown 
She plaited Mats o’ Rushes, 
And gave them to the Cottagers 
She met among the Bushes. 
Old Meg was brave as Margaret Queen 
And tall as Amazon: 
An old red blanket cloak she wore; 
A chip hat had she on. 
God rest her aged bones somewhere— 
She died full long agone! 
If you like these sort of Ballads I will now and then scribble 
one for you—if I send any to Tom I ll tell him to send them to

Mary Lamp (1764-1847) and her brother Charles spent their 
lives in London which they loved. Charles Lamb was born in 
Crown Office Row in the Temple, “the cheerful Crown Office 
Row” he calls it, and says.“a man would give something to 
have been born in such places.’ It was characteristic of this 
brother and sister to make the most of any good that life gave 
them, and to face their trials with courage and cheerfulness. 
Mary Lamb suffered from recurring attacks of mental illness; 
but, nevertheless, she was of great assistance to her brother in 
his literary work and, with him, was the author of Tales from 
Shakespeare. A letter to little Barbara Betham is especially 
interesting as a glimpse of the every-day life of the gentle, 
devoted brother and sister.

A BOOK OF LETTERS 
TO BARBARA BETHAM 
November 2, 1814. 
It is very long since I have met with such an agreeable sur- 
prise as the sight of your letter, my kind kind young friend, 
afforded me. Such a nice letter as it is too; and what a pretty 
hand you write! I congratulate you on this attainment with 
great pleasure, because I have so often felt the disadvantage 
of my own wretched handwriting. You wish for London news. 
I rely upon your sister Ann for gratifying you in this respect, 
yet I have been endeavoring to recollect whom you might have 
seen here, and what may have happened to them since, and this 
effort has only brought the image of little Barbara Betham, un- 
connected with any other person, so strongly before my eyes, 
that I seem as if I had no other subject to write upon. Now 
I think I see you with your feet propped upon the fender, vour 
two hands spread out upon your knees—an attitude you always 
chose when we were in familiar confidential conversation to- 
gether—telling me long stories of your own home, where now 
you say you are ‘moping on with the same thing every day,’ 
and which then presented nothing but pleasant recollections to 
your mind. How well I remember your quiet, steady face 
bent over your book. One day, conscience-stricken at having 
wasted so much of your precious time in reading, and feeling 
yourself, as you prettily said, ‘quite useless to me,’ you went 
to my drawers and hunted out some unhemmed pocket- 
handkerchiefs, and by no means could I prevail upon you to 
resume your story-books till you had hemmed them all. I 
remember, too, your teaching my little maid to read, your sitting 
with her a whole evening to console her for the death of her 
sister, and that she, in her turn, endeavoured to become a 
comforter to you, the next evening, when you wept at the 
sight of Mrs. Holcroft, from whose school you had recently 
146 
 
-P-A-G-E-171
  BRITISH LETTER-WRITERS 
eloped because you were not partial to sitting in the stocks. 
Those tears, and a few you dropped when my brother teased you 
about your supposed fondness for an apple-dumpling, were 
the only interruptions to the calm contentedness of your un- 
clouded brow. 
We still remain the same as you left us, neither taller, nor 
wiser, or perceptibly older; but three years must have made a 
great alteration in you. How very much, dear Barbara, I 
should like to see you! 
We still live in Temple Lane, but I am now sitting in a 
room you never saw. Soon after you left us we were distressed 
by the cries of a cat, which seemed to proceed from the garrets 
adjoining to ours, and only separated from ours by a locked 
door on the farther side of my brother’s bed-room, which you 
know was the little room at the top of the kitchen stairs. We 
had the lock forced, and let poor puss out from behind a panel 
of the wainscot, and she lived with us from that time, for we 
were in gratitude bound to keep her, as she had introduced 
us to four untenanted, unowned rooms, and by degrees we have 
taken possession of these unclaimed apartments, first putting 
up lines to dry our clothes, then moving my brother’s bed into 
one of these more commodious than his own rooms; and last 
winter, my brother being unable to pursue a work he had be- 
gun, owing to the kind interruptions of friends who were more 
at leisure than himself, I persuaded him that he might write 
at ease in one of these rooms, as he could not then hear the 
door-knock, or hear himself denied to be at home, which was 
sure to make him call out and convict the poor maid in a fib. 
Here, I said, he might be, almost really not at home. So I 
put in an old grate, and made him a fire in the largest of 
these garrets, and carried in his own table and one chair, and 
bid him write away and consider himself as much alone as if 
he were in a lodging in the midst of Salisbury Plain, or any 
other wide, unfrequented place where he could expect few 
147
-P-A-G-E-172

visitors to break upon his solitude. I left him quite delighted 
with his new acquisition, but in a few hours he came down 
again, with a sadly dismal face. He could do nothing, he 
said, with those bare white-washed walls before his eyes. He 
could not write in that dull unfurnished prison!’ 
The next day, before he came home from his office, I had 
gathered up various bits of old carpeting to cover the floor; 
and to break a little the blank look of the bare walls I hung 
up a few old prints that used to ornament the kitchen; and 
after dinner, with great boast of what improvement I had 
made, I took Charles once more into his new study. A week 
of busy labours followed, in which I think you would not have 
disliked to be our assistant. My brother and I almost covered 
the walls with prints, for which purpose he cut out every print 
from every book in his old library, coming in every now and 
then to ask my leave to strip a fresh poor author, which he 
might not do, you know, without my permission, as I am elder 
sister. ‘There was such pasting, such consultation upon these 
portraits, and where the series of pictures from Ovid, Milton, 
and Shakespeare would show to most advantage, and in what 
obscure corners authors of humble rank should be allowed to 
tell their stories. All the books gave up their stores but 
one, a translation from Ariosto, a delicious set of four and 
twenty prints, and for which I had marked out a conspicuous 
place; when lo, we found at the moment the scissors were going 
to work, that a part of the poem was printed at the back of 
every picture! What a cruel disappointment! ‘To conclude 
this long story about nothing, the poor despised garret is now 
called the print room, and is become our most familiar sitting- 
room. . . . The lions still roar in Exeter Change. Returning 
home through the Strand, I often hear them roar about twelve 
o'clock at night. I never hear them without thinking of you,

your young companions would stare when you told them you 
had seen a lion. 
And now, my dear Barbara, farewell. I have not written 
such a long letter a long time, but I am very sorry I had 
nothing amusing to write about. Wishing you may pass hap- 
pily through the rest of your schooldays and every future day 
of your life, 
I remain, 
Your affectionate friend

My brother sends his love to you. You say you are not so

receive a letter from you with very great delight.

Lorp GRANVILLE LEVESON GOWER (1773-1846), who after- 
wards became a statesman and diplomat, was the youngest of 
the children of Earl Gower. Little Leveson and his sisters, 
Georgiana, Susan, and Charlotte, were children of unusual 
beauty and engaging manners. A painting by Romney of this 
little group shows them in their childish grace and sweetness 
of face and figure. To Leveson, when thirteen years old, his 
mother wrote a letter, giving him advice which was evidently 
much needed. His letter to his sister some time later proves 
that a little of it had fallen upon good ground.

LADY STAFFORD, HIS MOTHER 
TRENTHAM, Nov. ye 4th, 1786. 
... 1 am very glad to see your writing so much improved. 
... Your Papa says that he wishes that you. could acquire 
the knack of expressing yourself well. He thinks it is in your 
own Power. He does not believe that Parker or Morpeth are 
better Scholars than you are, yet they make out very good let- 
ters, which he fancies is owing to their being less indolent; for 
you, tho’ you like to receive letters, will not give yourself 
Time to answer them, you will not employ your mind. You 
suck your thumbs, chew your Pocket Han. or a Bit of Paper, 
protest you do not know what to say, get up, sit down, fiddle 
faddle, and will not take the trouble of thinking. This is not 
meant for your last Letter, for your Papa thinks the writing 
and style both better than yours generally are. He hopes that 
Mr. Woodhouse makes you get by Heart every week some Pas- 
sages from Demosthenes, Plato, Homer, Cicero, Livy, Virgil, 
Milton, Shakespear, Pope, or Addison. He did not desire 
me to write this, but as he said it, I think there is no harm 
in repeating it. 
Lady Carlisle and your niece are still here. Mr. Vernon and 
Lady Anne we have not seen since you left us. Lord Dunmore 
and Lord Fincastle left us last Thursday. I believe you 
never saw the last; he is very plain, but his mind is well in-

old; I commend very much the style of the Epistle, but it wd. 
have sounded better had you written one with a later date. 
I was not mistaken in the word Tirade, for since I rec* your 
last I looked it out, and find it to be a long train of words. 
If there is a long train of words, there must consequently be 
a long letter; so for the future mind how you attack your 
Brother. I shd. not have mentioned this, only if I had been 
silent you wd. have concluded that I gave up the Point. I 
really am in great want of Materials to make a letter long 
enough to satisfy you; to begin to talk of my affection, etc., 
towards you, wd. be the same as saying “Queen Anne is dead” 
—at least what I hope you have known before. Politics is the 
common topic of Conversation, but what can we in the Coun- 
try say upon this Subject to a Londoner? To say J approve 
of the measures of Mr. Pitt wd. be echoing the voice of the 
major part of Great Britain. The Country is charmingly 
pleasant at this time. It is exactly like Spring: Snowdrops 
and Crocus’s are in full Bloom. Pray give my Duty to and 
tell my Mother that I will write to her to-morrow. Poor Fury 
has had the Misfortune to be bit by a mad dog, but she has 
not as yet shown any signs of insanity, so I am in hopes she 
will live—her Son Questor is a fine dog. Adieu.—Your affec- 
tionate Brother,

A CENTURY ago, the church of England possessed at least two 
of the wittiest men of their day,—Sydney Smith and Richard 
Harris Barham (1788-1845), both Canons of St. Paul’s. .The 
author of The Ingoldsby Legends claimed that he had not a 
spark of originality, only the gift of telling a story. Whether 
"we agree with him or not, we must delight in the surprises and 
ingenuity of his verses and the absurd humor of his legends.

The mock air of mystery with which he can clothe all that he 
touches adds no little to the charm of his unique tales. He was 
a delightful companion to his children, whose chief pleasure 
was to sit around the fire and listen to his stories. Second only 
to this was the joy of receiving one of his charming letters. 
His house in St. Paul’s Churchyard and, later, the house in 
Amen Corner were the scenes of many of these happy family 
gatherings. On these occasions, his cats were admitted to the 
family circle.

August 17, 1836. 
My dear little Ned, 
As I fear you have read 
All the books that you have, from great A down to Z, 
And your aunt, too, has said 
That you ’re very well bred, 
And don’t scream and yell fit to waken the dead, 
I think that instead 
Of that vile gingerbread 
With which little boys, I know, like to be fed 
(Though, lying like lead 
On the stomach, the head 
Gets affected, of which most mammas have a dread), 
I shall rather be led 
Before you to spread 
These two little volumes, one blue and one red. 
As three shillings have fled 
From my pocket, dear Ned 
Don’t dog’s-ear nor dirt them, nor read them in bed! 
Your affectionate father,

2. TO HIS DAUGHTER FANNY 
1837. 
My. DEAREST FAn, 
Till this moment I have not had five minutes’ leisure to an- 
swer your letter, the receipt of which, however, delighted me 
not a little, as its style convinced me that the “green and yel- 
low melancholy” which for the last fortnight I had seen creep- 
ing over your elongated visage must already have in a great 
measure disappeared, and that the kindness of your friends 
will ere long send you back a mightily improved specimen of 
Tonbridge ware. Your account of Mrs. Scoones is not less 
gratifying; pray tell her how much we both rejoice in her 
amended health, and hope for still better news in your next 
of the same description. 
And so, Fanny, you are running about all over the coun- 
try. Well, I hope all this will not turn your head, nor iDse 
duce you to make half as much noise in your progress as Ned 
and Mary Anne make in running about the house. It is what 
they are doing all day, with the exception of an occasional 
pause to mourn over a defunct silkworm, and a somewhat 
graver step in attending its obsequies in the dust-hole. But 
then many of their progeny are already spinning; indeed, the 
greater part, I believe, of their menagerie are at this moment 
thus industriously occupied, if I except certain ‘‘grubs,’’ who, 
having done their duty already, are, by way of reward I sup- 
pose, pensioned off into a sort of Chelsea Hospital for de- 
cayed veterans, revelling in sawdust or bran, or whatever it 
is, within the safe asylum of an old pill-box. Ned has dis- 
tinguished himself immortally as a carder and winder, and 
I can’t tell you how many skeins he has already “got off,” or 
how completely his mind is occupied by fairy visions of cer- 
tain silk waistcoats and hose of his own and his sisters’ manu-

facture. Your bird enjoys her health exceedingly well, but 
I cannot say she is in high feather just at present, being, ac- 
cording to her own account and that of your mother, in that 
interesting state of a transition of plumage which “fanciers” 
call ‘“‘moulting.” The fact is, she is something in Willy’s 
predicament—shedding her old coat, and I have no doubt will 
be out in all the glories of her new “long-tailed” one by the 
time you get back. In the meantime, Ellen looks after her 
very tenderly, as I hope you do after her prototype at Ton- 
bridge, for the moulting season is a very delicate and interest- 
ing period both for birds and bipeds. 
On Thursday I go down to the East Kent election, and your 
mother will probably accompany me. On the Monday fol- 
lowing, we go to spend a few days at Hanwell; after which I 
have a swan-hopping expedition with the Vintner’s Company, 
and then I fear I have more work cut out for me in East Kent 
about the Tithe Commutation Bill, of the nature of which, as 
well as of all other Acts of Parliament, you are in a state of 
blessed ignorance; and as Gray (not the Lord, but the Poet) 
says, “where ignorance is bliss, ’tis folly to be wise.” If this 
be so, I shall pack your mother up in my carpet-bag and take 
her with me, putting Edward and Mary Anne one into each 
pocket, with a good supply of gingerbread, barley-sugar, and 
perhaps a brandy-ball or two, as we may not meet with so 
civil a coachman as Mr. Mole. God bless you my dear girl! 
your mother will write to you in a day or two, but I shall be 
glad to hear from you whenever you can spare time. What on 
earth is your “Indiana dress’? Have you cowrie-bangles, a 
nose-ring, and peacock’s feathers, or what? Surely William’s 
coat must hide its diminished tail before such finery. God 
bless you once more, and believe me your fond father,

St. Pavuv’s, July 17, 1839. 
My Dearest Fan, 
Oh, the wonderful works of nature! Here have you been 
gone from home somewhat less than a fortnight, and only see 
what perturbations and permutations and transmogrifications 
(look in your pocket Johnson for these hard words) have 
either taken place, or are “progressing slick,” as the Ameri- 
cans say! Here have your mother and I been growing for the 
last fifteen years—no small portion of your life, Fan—like two 
antiquated cabbages running to seed, in St. Paul’s Church- 
yard, when all at once comes a good-natured gardener and 
offers to transplant us into a better position. Your mother, a 
fine full-grown Battersea, or rather Drumhead, which has the 
advantage over the other in point of circumference, is to be 
moved to-morrow, taking care to preserve as much of the 
earth about her roots as possible, across the Churchyard into 
Amen Corner, under a hot wall with a southern aspect. If 
she finds the soil congenial, I am to be put alongside, while 
Ned and Mary Anne, as an Early York and a broccoli sprout, 
are to be dibbled in as soon as possible. What do you think 
of Mr. Sydney Smith having offered me his residentiary house 
to live in, together with a garden at the back, which, if not al- 
together so large as the one you have no doubt been running 
about all day in, is yet magnificent for London; containing three 
polyanthus roots, a real tree, a brown box border, a muff- 
coloured jessamine, a shrub which is either a dwarf acacia or 
an overgrown gooseberry bush, eight broken bottles, and a 
tortoiseshell tom-cat asleep in the sunniest corner; “the whole,” 
as George Robbins would say, capable of the greatest improve- 
ment; with a varied and extensive prospect of the back of

the Oxford Arms, and a fine Hanging Wood (the New Drop 
at Newgate) in the distance; all being situated in the midst of 
a delightful neighbourhood, and well worth the attention of any 
capitalist wishing to make an investment! Seriously, your 
mamma is to make her report as to the eligibility of the ex- 
change to-morrow, and as she has already made up her mind 
fully on the subject, there can be little doubt but that she 
will eventually decide in favour of the measure. You may, 
therefore, expect to have your hands pretty full of employ- 
ment on your return in preparing for what the Scotch call 
“our flitting.” So enjoy yourself while you may, for there is 
work enough cut out for you, I promise you, when you get 
back: eighteen jars of onions to pickle, as many double-damson 
cheeses to press, some dozen of niggers to boil into black-currant 
jelly, and jams and marmalades to make without end; for, un- 
fortunately for you and all other females connected with the 
family, the new house is provided with that domestic curse, 
a roomy store-closet. So, my dear old Fan, make hay or dirt- 
pies, which is the same thing, while you can in comfort. One 
thing you may tell Mrs. Scoones from me, in announcing to 
her this metamorphosis (Johnson again, Fan), viz. that we 
shall now have a comfortable room to put her into without 
being obliged to squeeze her and the governor into a narrow 
cot, like a couple of ham sandwiches set up on end. Ned 
and Mary Anne send their loves; they have bought bows and 
arrows and a target, which they have already hit three times 
at a yard and a half distance; so there is every prospect of 
their becoming accomplished archers in time, and perhaps 
winning a silver bugle. I have nearly finished my paper, and 
crossed letters you know I neither give nor take. So God bless 
you, my dear Fan, keep your feet warm and your head cool, 
don’t twist your mouth about, and believe me to be, 
Your affectionate father 
R. His.

seven pots of raspberry jam; and Ned has got a donkey, and 
he is quite plump. and fat—not the donkey, but Ned; and I 
am going a fishing, and they are fiddling outside the window, 
and we caught eight dozen and a half of gudgeons last Wed-

preached yesterday at St. Gregory’s, and Mary Anne has got 
the oil cruet to dress her doll’s wig with; and they are mak-

Assure us, however, we sha ’n ’t have much trouble 
In suiting a number like ours, or even double. 
But then you ‘ll observe, since as yet we don’t know 
To what part of town we may happen to go, 
And cannot decide till at least we so far get, 
You had better direct to us “Post Office, Margate,” 
A mode of arrangement for want of a better 
Which I mean to adopt in the case of each letter. 
I sent down a salmon to-day, and I hope 
That it will not discredit the fishmonger, Pope, 
But I deeply regret things should turn out so cross 
That I could not procure one poor lobster for sauce; 
But somehow or other so few had come in, 
Pope had not a single one, neither had Lynn. 
So be sure, my dear Fanny, you make my excuses, 
And mind and write soon, and let’s know what the news is; 
Your mammy will write to you soon, and your bird 
Sings so loud and so long, it is really absurd; 
Mary Anne’s grown quite fond of the creature, indeed 
She does nothing but stuff it with sugar and seed. 
I really don’t think I have aught more to tell, 
And the postman below is come ringing his bell, 
So God bless you, my dear, I shall now say “Farewell,” 
Write to one of us soon, if you ask me, I’d rather 
You ’d address, of the two,

Tue fourth Earl of Chesterfield (1694-1773) was greatly 
concerned about the education of his son, Philip Stanhope, and 
wrote to him frequently, advising him about his education, 
manners, and dress. The letters are full of wit, advice, and 
158
-P-A-G-E-183
  BRITISH LETTER-WRITERS 
instruction. The letters following are in the collection en- 
titled Letters to His Son. 
1. TO HIS SON, PHILIP STANHOPE, ESQ. 
ISLEWORTH, September 19th, 1739. 
My Dear CHILD: 
I am much pleased with your last letter. The writing was 
very good and your promise a praiseworthy one. You must 
keep it, for a man of honor is always true to his word. You 
assure me that you will remember the instructions which I give 
you. That is enough; for, although you do not altogether un- 
derstand them now, years and reflection will gradually unfold 
their meaning. 
Returning to the contents of your letter, I believe that you 
have had able assistance; and I do not expect you, yet, to 
write a good letter entirely without aid. It is well, however, 
to try a little, for nothing is more essential than the ability to 
write a letter well. Indeed, there is really nothing easier. 
The fault of most of those who write badly is that they wish 
to write in a finer style than they can; and the result is un- 
natural and affected. To write well, one must write easily 
and naturally. For example, if you wish to write me a let- 
ter, it is only needful for you to think of what you would say 
to me if you were with me; then write quite simply, as if you 
were talking with me. Suppose, then, that you were to write 
me a letter quite by yourself. I imagine that it would be very 
much in words like these: 
My dear Papa,—I went to see Mr. Mattaire this morning 
where I translated English into Latin very well, and Latin 
into English so successfully that he wrote optime at the end. I 
also repeated a Greek verb fairly well. After that I ran home 
and played until dinner-time. Then matters became very 
159 
 
-P-A-G-E-184
  A BOOK OF LETTERS 
serious; and I ate like a wolf, so you see I am very well. 
Adieu. 
Now, this is a good letter, and yet one that is very easy to 
write because it is quite natural. Try to write me sometimes 
of yourself, without taking too much pains with the beauty of 
the writing or the accuracy of the lines. Give yourself as little 
trouble with it as possible. In this way, you will accustom 
yourself, little by little, to write perfectly well and without 
effort. Adieu. You are to come to me to-morrow at noon, or 
on Friday morning at eight o’clock. 
2. TO THE SAME 
Dear Boy: 
I send you here a few more Latin roots, though I am not 
sure that you will like my roots so well as those that grow in 
your garden; however, if you will attend to them, they may 
save you a great deal of trouble. These few will naturally 
point out many others to your own observation; and enable you, 
by comparison, to find out most derived and compound words, 
when once you know the original root of them. You are old 
enough now to make observations upon what you learn; which, 
if you would be pleased to do, you cannot imagine how much 
time and trouble it would save you. Remember, you are now 
very near nine years old; an age at which all boys ought to 
know a great deal, but you, particularly, a great deal more, 
considering the care and pains that have been employed about 
you; and, if you do not answer those expectations, you will 
lose your character, which is the most mortifying thing that 
can happen to a generous mind. Everybody has ambition of 
some kind or other, and is vexed when that ambition is disap- 
pointed: the difference is, that the ambition of silly people is 
a silly and mistaken ambition; and the ambition of people of 
sense is‘a right and commendable one. For instance, the am- 
160 
 
-P-A-G-E-185
  BRITISH LETTER-WRITERS 
bition of a silly boy of your age would be to have fine clothes, 
and money to throw away in idle follies: which, you plainly 
see, would be no proofs of merit in him, but only a folly in 
his parents, in dressing him out like a jackanapes, and giv- 
ing him money to play the fool with. Whereas, a boy of 
good sense places his ambition in excelling other boys of his 
own age, and even older, in virtue and knowledge. His glory 
is in being known always to speak the truth, in showing good 
nature and compassion, in learning quicker, and applying him- 
self more than other boys. ‘These are real proofs of merit in 
him, and consequently proper objects of ambition; and will ac- 
quire him a solid reputation and character. This holds true 
in men as well as in boys; the ambition of a silly fellow will 
be to have a fine equipage, a fine house, and fine clothes; things 
which anybody that has as much money may have as well as 
he, for they are all to be bought; but the ambition of a man 
of sense and honour is, to be distinguished by a character and 
reputation of knowledge, truth, and virtue; things which are 
not to be bought, and that can only be acquired by a good 
head and a good heart. Such was the ambition of the 
Lacedemonians and the Romans, when they made the greatest 
figure; and such I hope yours will always be. Adieu.

Dear Boy: 
You behaved yourself so well at Mr. Boden’s last Sunday, 
that you justly deserve commendation: besides, you encourage 
me to give you some rules of politeness and good breeding, be- 
ing persuaded that you will observe them. Know then, that as 
learning, honour, and virtue, are absolutely necessary to gain 
you the esteem and admiration of mankind; politeness and 
161 
 
-P-A-G-E-186
  A BOOK OF LETTERS 
good-breeding are equally necessary to make you welcome and 
agreeable in conversation and common life. Great talents, 
such as honour, virtue, learning, and parts, are above the 
generality of the world; who neither possess them themselves, 
nor judge of them rightly in others; but all people are judges 
of the lesser talents such as civility, affability, and an obliging, 
agreeable address and manner; because they feel the good 
effects of them, as making society easy and pleasing. Good 
sense must, in many cases, determine good breeding; because 
the same thing that would be civil at one time, and to one 
person, may be quite otherwise at another time, and to another 
person; but there are some general rules of good-breeding, that 
hold always true, and in all cases. As, for example, it is al- 
ways extremely rude, to answer only yes, or no, to anybody, 
without adding sir, my lord, or madam, according to the 
quality of the person you speak to: as, in French, you must 
always say, Monsieur, Milord, Madame, and Mademoiselle. I 
suppose you know that every married woman is, in French, 
Madame and every unmarried one is Mademoiselle. It is 
likewise extremely rude, not to give the proper attention, and 
a civil answer, when people speak to you; or to go away, or be 
doing something else, when they are speaking to you: for that 
convinces them that you despise them, and do not think it worth 
your while to hear or answer what they say. I dare say I 
need not tell you how rude it is, to take the best place in a 
room, or to seize immediately upon what you like at table, 
without offering first to help others; as if you considered no- 
body but yourself. On the contrary, you should always en- 
deavour to procure all the conveniences you can to the people 
you are with. Besides being civil, which is absolutely neces- 
sary, the perfection of good breeding is, to be civil with ease, 
and in a gentleman-like manner. For this, you should ob- 
serve the French people, who excel in it, and whose politeness 
seems as easy and natural as any other part of their conversa- 
162 
 
-P-A-G-E-187
  BRITISH LETTER-WRITERS 
tion. Whereas the English are often awkward in their civili- 
ties, and when they mean to be civil, are too much ashamed 
to get it out. But, pray, do you remember never to be ashamed 
of doing what is right; you would have a great deal of reason 
to be ashamed if you were not civil; but what reason can you 
have to be ashamed of being civil? And why not say a civil 
and obliging thing, as easily and as naturally as you would 
ask what o’clock it is? ‘This kind of bashfulness, which is 
justly called by the French, mauvaise honte, is the distinguish- 
ing character of an English booby; who is frightened out of 
his wits when people of fashion speak to him; and, when he 
is to answer them, blushes, stammers, and can hardly get out 
what he would say; and becomes really ridiculous, from a 
groundless fear of being laughed at: whereas a real well-bred 
man would speak to all the kings in the world, with as little 
concern, and as much ease, as he would speak to you. 
Remember, then, that to be civil, and to be civil with ease 
(which is properly called good breeding), is the only way to 
be beloved and well received in company; that to be ill-bred, 
and rude, is intolerable, and the way to be kicked out of com- 
pany; and that to be bashful is to be ridiculous. As I am sure 
you will mind and practise all this, I expect that when you are 
novennis, you will not only be the best scholar, but the best- 
bred boy in England of your age. Adieu.

One of the greatest writers and thinkers in England in the 
eighteenth century was Samuel Johnson (1709-1784). He 
compiled a dictionary of the English language, a great under- 
taking which required several years. Among his friends were 
such celebrities as Oliver Goldsmith, the author; Sir Joshua 
Reynolds, the painter; Edmund Burke, the actor; David Gar- 
rick, the actor; and James Boswell, his biographer. One of

TO MISS THRALE 
Lonpon, July 24, 1783. 
DeEaArREst Miss SopHy, 
By an absence from home, and for one reason or another, I 
owe a great number of letters, and I assure you, that I sit down 
to write yours first. Why you should think yourself not a 
favourite, I cannot guess; my favour will, I am afraid, never 
be worth much; but, be its value more or less, you are never likely 
to lose it, and less likely if you continue your studies with 
the same diligence as you have begun them. 
Your proficiency in arithmetic is not only to be commended 
but admired. Your master does not, I suppose, come very 
often, nor stay very long; yet your advance in the science of 
numbers is greater than is commonly made by those who, for 
so many weeks as you have been learning, spend six hours a 
day in the writing school. 
Never think, my sweet, that you have arithmetic enough; 
when you have exhausted your master, buy books. Nothing 
amuses more harmlessly than computation, and nothing is 
oftener applicable to real business or speculative enquiries. A 
thousand stories, which the ignorant tell and believe, die away 
at once, when the computist takes them in his tripe. I hope 
you will cultivate in yourself a disposition to numerical en- 
quiries; they will give you entertainment in solitude, by the 
practice; and reputation in public by the effect. 
If you can borrow Wilkins’s Real Character, a folio, which 
the bookseller perhaps can let you have, you will have a very

MatTTHEW Prior (1664-1721), the English poet, spent his 
early school-days at Westminster, that famous old-world school 
in the heart of London. Later he received a degree from Cam- 
bridge University. Many years of his life were spent in 
Holland as secretary to the British Ambassador at the Hague, 
and for a short time he represented the British Government in 
Paris. At one time he was a political prisoner in England, and 
is said to have written many of his verses during that trying 
experience. The grace and delicacy of his touch are shown 
in the charming letter to the little Lady Peggy.

At dawn of morn, and close of even, 
To lift your heart and hands to Heaven.

Our Father first—then Notre Pére 
And, dearest child, along the day, 
In everything you do and say,

So God shall love, and angels aid ye.

Sir Henry SIDNEY (1529-1586) was the father of Sir Philip 
Sidney, that chivalrous and courtly gentleman of the days of 
Queen Elizabeth. Sir Philip Sidney was killed on a battlefield 
in Holland in early manhood. The whole nation mourned his 
loss, because of his bravery, his learning, and the beauty of 
his character. When he was a boy of twelve at school in 
Shrewsbury, his father wrote a long letter for his guidance, 
and his mother added a loving postscript. An old book tells 
that this letter is “most necessarie for all yoong Gentlemen to 
be carried in memorie.” 
TO HIS SON, PHILIP 
SONNE PHILIP 
I have received two letters from you, the one written in 
Latine, the other in French, which I take in good parte, and 
will you to exercise that practise of learning often, for it will 
stand you in most steed in that profession of lyfe that you are 
borne to live in. And now sithence this is my first letter that

Let your first action be the lifting up of your minde to Al- 
mighty God by hartie prayer, and feelingly digest the wordes

him to whom you pray, & use this as an ordinarie and at an 
ordinarie houre, whereby the time it selfe will put you in remem-

time. Apply your studie such houres as your discreet Master

as shalbe both sufficient for your learning, yea & safe for your 
health; and marke the sence and matter of that you doo reade

as well as the words, so shall you both enrich your tongue 
with wordes, and your wit with matter, and judgement will 
grow, as yeares groweth in you. Be humble and obedient to 
your master, for unlesse you frame your self to obey others, 
yea and feele in your selfe what obedience is, you shall never 
be able to teach others how to obey you. Be courteous of ges- 
ture, and affable unto all men, with diversitie of reverence ac- 
cording to the dignitie of the person, there is nothing that 
winneth so much with so little cost, use moderate diet, so as 
after your meale you may find your wit fresher and not more 
duller, and your body more lively and not more heavie, seldome 
drinke wine, and yet sometimes do, least being inforced to 
drinke upon the sudden you should find your selfe inflamed, 
use exercise of body, but such as is without perill.of your bones 
or joints, it will encrease your force and enlarge your breath,

and otherwise lothsome, give your selfe to be merie, for you 
degenerate from your father if you find not your selfe most able 
in wit and bodie, to do any thing when you be most merie, but 
let your mirth be ever void of all scurrilitie & biting words 
to any man, for an wound given by a worde is oftentimes harder 
to bee cured than that which is given with the sword: be you 
rather a hearer & bearer away of other mens talke, than a be- 
ginner or procurer of spech, otherwise you shalbe accompted 
to delite to heare your self speake. Be modest in ech assem- 
blie, & rather be rebuked of light felowes for maidenlike shame- 
fastnes, than of your sad friends for peart boldnes: think upon 
every worde that you will speake before you utter it, and re- 
member how nature hath rampered up as it were the tongue 
with teeth, lips, yea and haire without the lips, and all be- 
tokening raines and bridles to the lesse use of that member,

it is to your shame, for there cannot be a greater reproach to a 
Gentleman than to be accompted a lyer. Study and endevour 
your selfe to be vertuously occupied, so shall you make such an 
habite of well doing in you, as you shall not know how to do 
evill though you would: Remember my Sonne the Noble 
bloud you are discended of by your mothers side, & thinke 
that only be vertuous life and good action, you may be an orna- 
ment to that ylustre family, and otherwise through vice & 
sloth you may be accompted Labes generis, a spot of your kin, 
one of the greatest cursses that can happen to a man. Well

for you, but yet if I finde that this light meat of digestion, do

In the fifteenth century there lived in Norfolk, England the 
Paston family. Over one thousand letters and documents 
written by or to the various members of the family have been 
preserved. These letters tell the reader just how well-to-do 
people lived in an English manor-house in the fifteenth century. 
If the reader can master the difficulties of very old-fashioned 
spelling, he will find that these letters were written by people not 
very different from people of the twentieth century. The 
school boy in the following letter writes about money for his 
board bill, new clothes that he wants, and his approaching 
holiday.

Up to a few years ago, there was a popular book in every 
library called The Compleat Letter-Writer. It was a collec- 
tion of model letters to be copied exactly, with the correct names 
inserted at the beginning and end of the letter. Below are 
letters that were recommended for use by young people when 
they were confronted by situations similar to those discussed 
in the letters.

LETTER FROM A YOUNG GENTLEMAN TO HIS 
COMPANION, RECOVERED FROM A FIT OF 
SICKNESS 
It gives me the most sincere pleasure to hear that my dear 
Henry is recovering his health so rapidly. Had you died, it 
would have been to me a most terrible loss; but it has pleased 
God to preserve my friend. I will take the first opportunity 
that offers, to call and tell you how valuable your life is to 
Your sincere friend and playfellow 
ANSWER TO THE PRECEDING LETTER 
Your obliging letter, my dear Billy, is a fresh proof of your 
friendship and esteem for me. I thank God I am now per- 
fectly recovered. I am in some doubt, whether I ought not to 
consider my late illness as a just punishment for my crime 
of robbing Mr. Goodman’s orchard, breaking his boughs, and 
spoiling his hedges. However, I am fully determined that 
no such complaint shall ever more come against

WirTH the publication of The Story of Mankind, the name 
_ of Hendrik Van Loon (1882) became a household word. Born 
in Holland, educated at Munich and Cornell, he has had a 
varied and eventful life, especially during the period of the 
World War. The letter following is the introduction to The 
Story of Mankind. 
TO HANSJE AND WILLEM?* 
For HANSJE AND WILLEM: 
When I was twelve or thirteen years old, an uncle of mine 
who gave me my love for books and pictures promised to take 
me upon a memorable expedition. I was to go with him to 
the top of the tower of Old Saint Lawrence in Rotterdam. 
And so, one fine day, a sexton with a key as large as that 
of Saint Peter opened a mysterious door. ‘Ring the bell,” he 
said, “when you come back and want to get out,” and with a 
great grinding of rusty old hinges he separated us from the 
noise of the busy street and locked us into a world of new 
and strange experiences. 
For the first time in my life I was confronted by the phe- 
nomenon of audible silence. When we had climbed the first 
flight of stairs, I added another discovery to my limited knowl- 
edge of natural phenomena—that of tangible darkness. A 
match showed us where the upward road continued. We went 
to the next floor and then to the next and the next until I had

lost count and then there came still another floor, and suddenly 
we had plenty of light. This floor was on an even height with 
the roof of the church, and it was used as a storeroom. Cov- 
ered with many inches of dust, there lay the abandoned symbols 
of a venerable faith which had been discarded by the good peo- 
ple of the city many years ago. That which had meant life and 
death to our ancestors was here reduced to junk and rubbish. 
The industrious rat had built his nest among the carved images 
and the ever watchful spider had opened up shop between the 
outspread arms of a kindly saint. 
The next floor showed us from where we had derived our 
light. Enormous open windows with heavy iron bars made the 
high and barren room the roosting place of hundreds of 
pigeons. The wind blew through the iron bars and the air was 
filled with a weird and pleasing music. It was the noise of 
the town below us, but a noise which had been purified and 
cleansed by the distance. The rumbling of heavy carts and 
the clinking of horses’ hoofs, the winding of cranes and pulleys, 
the hissing sound of the patient steam which had been set to 
do the work of man in a thousand different ways—they had 
all been blended into a softly rustling whisper which provided 
a beautiful background for the trembling cooing of the pigeons. 
Here the stairs came to an end and the ladders began. And 
after the first ladder (a slippery old thing which made one 
feel his way with a cautious foot) there was a new and even 
greater wonder, the town-clock. I saw the heart of time. I 
could hear the heavy pulsebeats of the rapid seconds—one— 
two—three—up to sixty. Then a sudden quivering noise when 
all the wheels seemed to stop and another minute had been 
chopped off eternity. Without pause it began again—one—two 
—three—until at last:after a warning rumble and the scrap- 
ing of many wheels a thunderous voice, high above us, told 
the world that it was the hour of noon. 
On the next floor were the bells. The nice little bells and 
176 
 
-P-A-G-E-201
OTHER LETTER-WRITERS 
their terrible sisters. In the centre the big bell, which made me 
turn stiff with fright when I heard it in the middle of the 
night telling a story of fire or flood. In solitary grandeur it 
seemed to reflect upon those six hundred years during which 
it had shared the joys and the sorrows of the good people of 
Rotterdam. Around it, neatly arranged like the blue jars of 
an old-fashioned apothecary shop, hung the little fellows, who 
twice each week played a merry tune for the benefit of the 
country-folk who had come to market to buy and sell and hear 
what the big world had been doing. But in a corner—all 
alone and shunned by the others—a big black bell, silent and 
stern, the bell of death. ' 
Then darkness once more and other ladders, steeper and even 
more dangerous than those we had climbed before, and sud- 
denly the fresh air of the wide heavens. We had reached the 
highest gallery. Above us the sky. Below us the city—a 
little toy-town, where busy ants were hastily crawling hither 
and thither, each one intent upon his or her particular business, 
and beyond the jumble of stones, the wide greenness of the open 
country. 
It was my first glimpse of the big world. 
Since then, whenever I have had the opportunity, J have 
gone to the top’ of the tower and enjoyed myself. It was hard 
work, but it repaid in full the mere physical exertion of climb- 
ing a few stairs. 
Besides, I knew what my reward would be. I would see the 
land and the sky, and I would listen to the stories of my kind 
friend the watchman, who lived in a small shack, built in a 
sheltered corner of the gallery. He looked after the clock and 
was a father to the bells, and he warned of fires, but he en- 
joyed many free hours and then he smoked a pipe and thought 
his own peaceful thoughts. He had gone to school almost 
fifty years before and he had rarely read a book, but he had 
lived on the top of his tower for so many years that he had 
177

absorbed the wisdom of that wide world which surrounded him 
on all sides. 
History he knew well, for it‘was a living thing with him. 
“There,” he would say, pointing to a band of the river, “there, 
my boy, do you see those trees? That is where the Prince of 
Orange cut the dikes to drown the land and save Leyden.” 
Or he would tell me the tale of the old Meuse, until the broad 
river ceased to be a convenient harbour and became a won- 
derful highroad, carrying the ships of De Ruyter and Tromp 
upon that famous last voyage, when they gave their lives that 
the sea might be free to all. 
Then there were the little villages, clustering around the pro- 
tecting church which once, many years ago, had been the home 
of their Patron Saints. In the distance we could see the lean- 
ing tower of Delft. Within sight of its high arches, William 
the Silent had been murdered and there Grotius had learned to 
construe his first Latin sentences. And still further away, the 
long low body of the church of Gouda, the early home of the 
man whose wit had proved mightier than the armies of many 
an emperor, the charity-boy whom the world came to know 
as Erasmus. 
Finally the silver line of the endless sea and as a contrast 
immediately below us, the patchwork of roofs and chimneys and 
houses and gardens and hospitals and schools and railways, 
which we called our home. But the tower showed us the old 
home in a new light. The confused commotion of the streets 
and the market-place, of the factories and the workshops, be- 
came the well-ordered expression of human energy and purpose. 
Best of all, the wide view of the glorious past, which sur- 
rounded us on all sides, gave us new courage to face the 
_ problems of the future when we had gone back to our daily 
tasks. 
History is the mighty tower of Experience, which Time has

built amidst the endless fields of bygone ages. It is no easy 
task to reach the top of this ancient structure and get the bene- 
fit of the full view. ‘There is no elevator, but young feet are 
strong and it can be done. 
Here I give you the key that will open the door.

THE recent World War stirred many people to express them- 
selves in literary form. One of the most literary expressions 
of the war was written to America by Odette Gastinet, a 
French girl, in her teens. In this message, the reader will 
find a great thought, simply expressed. 
A MESSAGE TO AMERICA 
Ce n’était qu’une petite riviére, presque un ruisseau; on 
Vappelait 1’Yser; on se parlait d’un bord 4 l’autre sans élever 
la voix, et les oiseaux la franchissaient d’un battement d’aile. 
Et sur les deux rives, il y avait des millions d’hommes, tournés 
les uns vers les autres, les yeux dans les yeux. Mais la dis- 
tance qui les séparait etait plus grande distance des etoiles dans 
le ciel; c’était celle qui sépare le droit de l’injustice. 
L’océan est si vaste, que les mouettes n’osent pas le traverser. 
Pendant sept jours et sept nuits les grands paquebots d’Amér- 
ique, lancés 4 toute vapeur, déchirent l’eau profonde avant 
d’apercevoir les phares de France. Mais d’un bord 4 l'autre, 
les coeurs se touchent.

It was only a little river, almost a brook; it was called the 
Yser. One could talk from one side to the other without rais- 
ing one’s voice, and the birds could fly over it with one sweep 
of their wings. And on the two banks there were millions of 
men, one turned toward the other, eye to eye. But the dis- 
tance which separated them was greater than the stars in the 
sky; it was the distance which separates right from injustice. 
The ocean is so vast that the seagulls do not dare to cross it. 
During seven days and seven nights the great steamships of 
America, going at full-speed, drive through the deep waters be- 
fore the lighthouses of France come into view; but from one

HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN (1805-1875), the Danish story- 
teller and author of a collection of fairy tales, had a boyhood 
of poverty and struggle. However, in his old age, he was the 
friend of kings and princes and knew Charles Dickens, 
Alexandre Dumas, and Victor Hugo. Some of Andersen’s 
happiest hours were spent at Gad’s Hill, as the guest of Charles 
Dickens. The following letters were addressed to little Marie, 
a Danish boy, and to Anna Mary Livingstone of Scotland, 
whose father explored Africa and was found by another great 
explorer, Henry M. Stanley. 
1. TO MARIE —— 
DEAR LITTLE MARIE, 
Papa and mamma can read this letter to you, as you can- 
not read it yourself yet; but only wait till this time four years; 
ah, then you ll be able to read everything, I know. I am in

you had any? One can taste them right down into one’s 
stomach. Yesterday I went down to the sea . . . and sat ona 
rock by the shore. Presently a large white bird that they 
call a gull came flying along. It flew right towards me, so that 
I fancied it would have slapped me with its wings; but mercy 
on us, it said, ‘Ma-ma-ree!’ ‘Why, what’s the matter?’ I 
asked. ‘Ma-ma-ree!’ it said again, and then of course I 
understood that ‘Ma-ma-ree’ meant Marie, ‘Oh,’ said I, 
‘then you bring me a greeting from Marie; that’s what it is, 
eh?’ ‘Ya-ya! Ma-ma-ree,’ it said. It could n’t say it any 
better than that, for it only knew gull language, and that is 
not very much like ours. “Thanks for the greeting,’ said I, 
and off flew the gull. After that, as I was walking in the 
garden, a little sparrow came flying up. ‘I suppose now you 
have flown a long way?’ said I. ‘Vit, vit,’ * it said. ‘Have 
you been at Petershoi?’ I asked. ‘Lit, lit, lit,’ ¢ it said. 
‘Did you see Marie?’ I asked. ‘Tit, tit, tit,’ t it said. ‘Then 
give my greeting to Marie, for I suppose you are going back ?’ 
I said. ‘Lit, lit,’ § it replied. If it has not come yet, it 
will come later on, but first I “Il send you this letter. You may 
feed the little bird, if you like, but you must not squeeze it. 
Now greet from me all good people, all sensible beasts, and 
all the pretty flowers that wither before I see them. Isn’t it 
nice to be in the country, to paddle in the water, to eat lots 
of nice things, and to get a letter from your sweetheart,

lines and a blot on the first page! Next time you must really 
write a little closer, and on all three pages. Odense Fair is 
now over; we had glorious weather and splendid opportunities 
for studying life. The last day I was in Hoffmansgave I had 
quite a treat——I saw some infusoria. Just think, there was 
only one little drop of water on a piece of glass, and it was 
a whole world of insects, of which the largest looked like 
grasshoppers, the smallest as pins’ heads. Some of them were 
really like grasshoppers, others had the most monstrous shapes, 
all were tumbling about each other, and the big ones swallowed 
their smaller neighbours. I saw infusoria in my own blood; 
it swarmed with eels and cod and all sorts. This was no opti- 
cal illusion I could see by the forms of the insects and the 
movements of the different joints; and, besides this, when you 
touched the globule with the point of a pin dipped in acid, 
they at once fled to the side and died a moment after. The 
white mould in ink was a great forest, with plants, trees, and 
bushes; the infinite opened before me, and I turned dizzy. 
I am very pleased that your dear mother is going to Moen, 
I hope the weather may be fine, and she will then really enjoy 
the trip. I wish I could be there with you, and if, when we 
had seen the view from ‘‘Droning Stolen,” we turned to the 
microscope, like the one in Hoffmansgave, to see the infusoria 
in the drop of water, we should be standing between two 
infinities. 
Now please remember to ask your mother to favour me with 
a few lines in your letter as regards the poems, The Mermaid 
in Tamso and Phantasy at the North Sea; besides this I 
should like to know what she thinks of my Poetical Jutland 
Pot. 
Remember me kindly to your dear father, and also to Dina, 
and all the brothers. I could wish for your sister’s sake that 
it would blow a gale when she goes by the steamer, so that 
she might try if it would not move even the stoutest heart. I

from you soon—very soon; I am longing for one, because the 
last was nothing. I am sure nobody at home could have seen 
it, or they would have asked you to write a little more. It is 
easy enough,—all you have to do is to chat, and write what 
you say. Adieu. 
Yours, 
ANDERSEN 
This letter of mine is equal to four of yours; therefore, please 
don’t make them so short. The last I got drove me to despair; 
it nae as short as a sneeze, but still I would say, “God bless 
you.” Write and write more. Tell me all about this and that, 
about all at home and all outside, or about myself. You know 
I like that: don’t I? -Farewell!

The Goloshes of Fortune, The Snow Queen, and some others. 
My papa’s name is Dr. Livingstone. I am sending my card

My Drar Hans C. ANDERSEN, 
It is a very long time since I have written to you, but I 
am writing to you now, and that is so much. Is it not? I 
was so delighted to get your letter; and when I got your card 
I looked at it, and thought that I had got acquainted with a 
gentleman whom I would like very much. I thank you very 
much for the “Translation,” for without it I could not under- 
stand your letter, and then I would not have been able to an- 
swer any of the questions you asked me. We got news twice 
about papa, but none of them were true. But last Friday our 
station-master, who knows us, came up with a paper that had 
news, the good news, and oh! we were so delighted. I saw 
the story of Vaende and Glande. I thought it very pretty, and 
I hope you will write some more. The first that I ever read 
was Maja, or Little Thumb. Thomas and Oswell, my brothers, 
and Agnes, my sister, are quite well. Only my mamma is 
dead, and I have two aunts, Janet and Agnes Livingstone, 
with whom my home is. It is a very nice home. I once had a 
Grandmamma Livingstone, but she is. dead now. Please 
could you tell me if you know the Swedish language. Tell 
me in your next letter if you do. With my best love to all

time ago, and thanks for all that you have told me about the

pantomime which you saw in the Theatre Royal. That must 
have been an enjoyable evening. I know the story of Sindbad 
quite well. It is in The Arabian Nights. You must read the 
book. I will also send at the first opportunity the continua- 
tion of the tales and stories which your sister Agnes brought 
from me. In my new book there are many, many tales which 
you will scarcely know. I was staying at a country house 
outside Copenhagen when your sister and some friends de- 
lighted me with their visit and brought me greetings from lit- 
tle Mary Livingstone. How kind and thoughtful of her. Re- 
member me to her and to the noble old lady who accompanied 
her. Greetings to each of her companions whom I then saw. 
Here in Denmark we often speak of your dear papa and his 
travels in Africa. Recently I read in a newspaper that he 
had left there and was on his way back to Europe. Hurrah! 
That would be indeed splendid. The dear God never for- 
sakes good people who live in Him, and produce good works. 
What a joy for the family, what a festival for the whole coun- 
try it will be, when the dear energetic father whom we all 
value and honour returns to England! Then when he has 
well kissed his little Mary, conversed with her, and told her 
everything, remember me to him, and greet him kindly for me, 
him over whom God has stretched His protecting hand to the 
delight and instruction of us all. Greet the aunt also, and 
every member of the family who is well-disposed towards little 
Mary’s friend, Hans Christian Andersen. 
Now I am out in the country, close by the sea coast, and am 
staying at an ancient castle with a high tower. The garden runs 
down to the sea-shore, and stretches away to the beech woods, 
which are now splendidly fresh and green. The whole ground 
of the forest is like a carpet strewn with violets and anemones. 
The wood doves are cooing, and the cuckoo’s note is heard. 
Here I shall certainly write a new story, which my little 
friend will afterwards read. After Whitsuntide I shall re-

merry.

My Dearest H. ANDERSEN, 
I meant to have written to you long ago and sent you a green- 
stone for that you lost; but I never could get time. First my 
brother Thomas took very ill with pleurisy, eleven weeks from 
to-day, and this is the first day he has been able to be down- 
stairs. Then we had Mr. Stanley. He came to stay a day or 
two with the Provost of Hamilton, Mr. Dykes, and to lecture 
here. He was presented with the freedom of the Burgh of Ham- 
ilton. My sister Agnes and one of my aunts and I were intro- 
duced to him on the platform, amid loud cheers. He came in 
the afternoon to our house, and then went to the banquet in the 
town hall. In the evening he delivered a very interesting lec- 
ture. Next day we took him to see the palace, and then he 
went away. I was very sorry when he went. I like him so 
much. When I was in Iona, a Highland relation of ours 
gave me a whole sovereign. Agnes, and Thomas, and Oswell, 
and I bought a beautiful gold locket for Mr. Stanley, and had 
his initials put on it, and inside is papa on one side, and on 
the other his four children, in recognition of his finding papa. 
So I gave ten shillings of the sovereign for this locket; and, 
as I have heard that there have been dreadful floods in Den- 
mark, I willingly give the other ten shillings for the relief 
of the people. You will please see that it is given all right. 
I am studying German just now and find it very interesting.

CoPpENHAGEN, December, 1872. 
My Dear LITTLE FRIEND, 
During more than seven weeks I have been ill and am not 
not quite well. 
The greatest sympathy and attention have been shown me 
by our Royal House as well as by the poorest. Our dear 
good-hearted Crown Prince, the brother of the amiable Princess 
of Wales, has visited me. Sympathy I have had in the fullest 
measure, but convalescence progresses but slowly. Reading 
wearies me, and writing I cannot and dare not undertake. One 
of my friends is writing this from dictation. I shall be very 
glad to get a letter from my dear little friend in return. Now 
I possess and guard “the greenstone” which can protect me on 
sea voyages, but the dearest to me still is the nice little letter 
which tells me of Mary’s home, and Stanley’s visit to Hamil- 
ton. It was right and natural of you to buy the locket, and 
have papa’s portrait, and Mary’s and her sister’s set in it, and 
to give it to Stanley. He will understand and appreciate the 
gift. But it rejoices and touches me deeply that my good, 
dear little friend has also thought so tenderly of the need of 
the sufferers from the floods in Denmark, my native land, and 
has sent for them the other half of the sovereign. Thanks, 
dear, good child! May heaven grant that your father will 
soon press a kiss on your rosy little mouth! The half- 
sovereign has been forwarded to the Central Committee for the 
relief of our sufferers from the floods. My mention of it has 
stirred all my friends, and in most of the newspapers of our

country this pretty incident has been warmly commented on, 
so that if Mary really comes over here with her father, she 
will find friends for herself, as he finds them in all the coun- 
tries of the North. I also send in a wrapper the first news- 
paper that mentions little Mary’s gift. 
I forward in another wrapper a good portrait of myself. 
It will reach you, with this letter, which contains the most 
heartfelt Christmas greetings and New Year’s wishes for Mary, 
and all her dear ones in Livingstone’s, Byron’s, and Walter 
Scott’s great country. 
Cheer me soon with a letter! 
H. C. ANDERSEN 
Uva CoTTacEe, HAMILTON, 
24th September, 1874. 
My Dear Hans ANDERSEN, 
I have often thought of you since you wrote to me last, and 
wished to write to you, but never got to do so before. You 
would see from the newspapers the great sorrow we have had 
this year. I did so expect to have had papa take me to see you 
in Denmark. Instead of going to the different places I fully 
intended to with papa, I was obliged to take the sad journey 
to London to see him buried in Westminster Abbey. Both my 
aunts were there, and also my brothers and sister. We all 
had wreaths of pure white flowers to put on his coffin. At 
one o’clock the procession entered the abbey, and the coffin was 
placed on velvet trestles. It was covered with a black velvet 
pall edged with white silk and the top of the coffin was cov- 
ered with white wreaths and palm leaves. While the pro- 
cession was moving along the organ played most beautifully. 
Then we all sang that hymn: 
“OQ God of Bethel, by whose hand 
Thy people still are fed, 
188
-P-A-G-E-213
  OTHER LETTER-WRITERS 
Who through this weary pilgrimage 
Hast all our fathers led.” 
Then the procession to the grave formed. Immediately after 
the coffin came, grandpapa (Dr. Moffat) and my two brothers, 
Thomas and Oswell. Next came my sister and myself, and 
behind us my aunts, and then friends. When the coffin was 
set down at the grave, which was all draped in black, Agnes, 
my sister, and I had to lay our wreaths on the coffin, and then 
my aunts laid theirs. One of my aunts from the south of 
England laid a wreath of violets and primroses from a lane 
that papa liked to walk in very much. We were ranged round 
close to the grave, and a beautiful anthem was sung, called: 
“His body was buried in peace.” Then the Dean read the 
funeral service, and all was over. The abbey was crowded, 
and the vergers of the abbey said they had never seen such a 
number of people in Westminster Abbey since the death of the 
Prince Consort. ‘There was a funeral service preached in the 
abbey the next Sunday. The picture of me that I send you 
is taken just as I stood at papa’s grave. It was my ‘first 
visit to London. Papa’s two coloured servants were here seeing 
us last week. ‘They were telling us a great many interesting 
things about papa; and one of them, called Chumah, made a 
little model of the grass hut in which papa died, and showed 
us the position of papa’s bed in it. It is very interesting to us. 
I was very, very sorry to hear you had been so ill, but I 
hope you are better now. I should so much like, if you are 
able, to get a letter from you. My brother has gone back to 
Egypt again. 
_I am going to a boarding-school next week, which will be 
a new experience to me altogether. 
I forgot to tell you, when speaking of papa’s funeral, that 
our beloved Queen sent a most lovely white wreath, and she 
and the Prince of Wales had their carriages at the abbey.

GrorcE SAND (1804-1876) was the name under which 
Armandine Lucile Aurore, Baroness Dudevant, wrote her many 
novels. She was a Frenchwoman of great talent and charming 
personality, and an indefatigable writer. Her letters are in- 
teresting, not only for their style, which is graceful and pictur- 
esque, but for the tenderness and depth of feeling they reveal. 
She was passionately devoted to her little son and daughter, 
Maurice and Solange. Her letters to Maurice are bright and 
gay, full of pretty descriptive touches and loving solicitude for 
his welfare. Her pet name for little Solange is “la grosse 
mignonne” which, literally translated, means “great darling.” 
It is, however, one of the French phrases which cannot be so 
well expressed in English. 
1. TO MAURICE DUDEVANT 
Paris, November, 1831. 
Your letter is very pretty, my dear little one; it is very well 
written. Do not remain outdoors too long in this dreadful 
cold; you know that you are not quite well. When you are 
in the garden, run, leap, do not remain in the same place. 
That is what always gives you your illnesses. Your magpie 
can very well stay in your garden. It has no fear of cold. 
Its feathers are warmer than your coats and pantaloons. Our 
little bengalis are more delicate; They come from a warm 
climate. Tell Eugenie to take good care of them. 
I went yesterday to the Jardin des Plantes. I would have 
liked to bring you a little tawny gazelle with white stripes and

great black eyes. It eats out of one’s hand. You would be 
enchanted to have one like it; but it would have to be kept in 
the chimney-corner. They come from Africa and the least 
cold kills them. However, you have seen them yourself; but, 
perhaps you do not remember. 
I would be very happy to have you here for a fortnight, and 
to make you run about everywhere with me. 
Adieu, my little friend. I embrace you a thousand times, 
as well as your grosse mignonne. See that she wears her 
woollen stockings every day. Embrace for me Leontine and 
Boucoiran. 
2. TO THE SAME 
Paris, April 4, 1832. 
We arrived in the best of health, your sister and I, my dear 
little love. Solange has done only one sum since we left 
Chateauroux until now. She has thought of you and of her 
nurse. She has wept twice to see you, but has consoled her- 
self very quickly. At her age, grief does not last long. She 
has been sweet and gentle all the time. When you were very 
little, you were not so docile as she is. When we arrived, she 
recognized your portrait at once, and cried; then she very soon 
went to sleep. 
I have taken her to the Luxembourg and the Jardin des 
Plantes. She saw the giraffe and maintained that she had seen 
it before in a meadow:at Nohant. She fed with her own 
hands the little goats from Tibet and the cranes. She saw the 
stuffed animals and refused to believe that they were not 
alive. Moreover, she is altogether without fear. If I give her 
my hand, she is afraid of nothing. 
She laughs; she sings; she is charmingly pretty; she eats as 
much as six children; she sleeps in the omnibus, wakes when

we alight, and begins to walk without grumbling. It is im- 
possible for a child to be better. I am delighted to have her 
with me. If I had you too, my poor child, I would be very 
happy. 
And you, my little kitten, how are you? Do you entertain 
yourself pleasantly always? Is your crane, too, alive and well? 
Adieu, my dear little angel. I kiss you a thousand times on 
your rosy cheeks and your nose, your great eyes and your 
beautiful hair. Write to me very often. Your ‘sister em- 
braces you also; she wishes to take you strawberries and ices 
in a paper. ‘They would be in good order upon arrival! 
3. TO THE SAME 
Paris, May 4, 1832. 
My Littie Dar ine, 
We are very well. Your sister is very charming at present. 
We frequently go to walk in the Luxembourg and in the 
Jardin des Plantes. The latter is superbly beautiful and 
balmy with the scent of acacias. Nohant must be very lovely 
at present. Are there many flowers and how does your own 
garden grow? My garden is composed of a dozen pots of 
flowers upon my balcony; but there are some new shoots as 
long as my hand. Solange breaks them very often; and, so that 
I will not scold her, she tries to mend them with wafers of 
sealing-wax. 
We speak of you every evening and every morning; when 
we go to bed and when we rise. I dreamed to-night, that you 
were as tall as I. I did not even know you. You came to 
embrace me; and I was so happy that I wept. When I awoke, 
I found that the grosse had climbed upon my bed and was 
kissing me. She has grown very tall, and has become thinner 
at the same time. No one can believe that she is not yet five 
years old. She is a head taller than other children of her age.

All the bonbons that are given her, she puts aside for you. 
At the end of an hour, she thinks no more of you and eats 
them. When we go to see you, we will bring you some. 
Adieu, my beloved little child. Write me longer letters, if 
you can, and write them oftener. You do not say what you 
learn with Boucoiran. Adieu, I embrace you with all my heart. 
4. TO THE SAME 
Paris, 17th May, 1832. 
My Dear LITTLE ONE, 
I have received your two letters. I have sent you a large 
one full of drawings. Will you amuse yourself by copying 
them? What do you do in the evening? Do you work in 
your study or do you run about in the garden with Leontine? 
Do you dance every day? ‘Tell me how you pass your days. 
Tell me from morning to evening. 
Your little sister is well. She is beginning to feel at home 
in Paris and to become naughty. Until now, she was so aston- 
ished with everything that she saw that she did not remember to 
have whims. Just now she has been very troublesome; but I 
did not give in to her and she is good again. Some children 
who live upon the same balcony as we do, laugh at her and 
mimic her when they hear her cry. This vexes her dreadfully; 
she forces back her tears at once and ventures to say nothing 
more. It has been a long time since we have been in the 
country. It rains every day and is so cold that we always 
have a fire. I have two little green canaries in a cage. They 
had some eggs which were hatched this morning. If you 
could have seen how that interested Solange. She does not 
understand them, and would like to put them in her pocket. 
They are so little, so lean, so thin, so bald, so ugly, that they 
would die if one breathed upon them. 
We have, too, a beautiful garden upon our balcony,—roses, 
193
-P-A-G-E-218

jessamine, lilac, gilliflowers, orange-trees, a geranium, mignon- 
ette, and even a black currant-tree all covered with green fruit. 
If you come to see me this summer, I will make you eat them; 
but you will have better ones at Nohant. Solange amuses her- 
self by putting earth in pots. She then plants seeds in the 
pots; no sooner do they begin to grow than she pulls them up. 
Adieu, mon gros mignon. Write to me often; tell me of all 
that interests you. Think often of your old mother who loves 
you. 
5. TO THE SAME 
Paris, February 27, 1833. 
You say to me my child, that I do not write often. It is 
you, little jester, who are so finely lazy in replying tome. You 
write me little scraps of letters,—very short. I should like so 
much to know everything that you do, how you amuse your- 
self, with what you busy yourself, how you sleep. After all, 
I shall know it all soon. You are to tell your father to write 
me when he will be able to leave so that I may go to meet you 
in the diligence. I will put you in my warm, warm bed; your 
great sister will devour you as a piece of bread. Just now 
she speaks of you as her little jewel of a brother; she is al- 
ways a darling and very droll. 
This morning she had much sorrow. She let her doll fall 
in the garden; and the dogs devoured it. When she went 
back to pick it up, there remained only one leg which the 
dogs had not been able to consume. So the poor little one 
roared like a calf. 
Adieu, my little angel. Embrace everyone for me. You, I 
kiss a thousand times upon your rosy cheeks. Adieu, dear 
little one.

6. TO MAURICE DUDEVANT AT THE COLLEGE OF 
HENRI QUATRE IN PARIS 
MARSEILLES, December 18, 1833. 
My Dear LITTLE ONE, 
I am at Marseilles, after having travelled, sometimes by 
carriage, sometimes by boat, ever since the day I left you. I 
came down the Rhone by steamboat; and I am going to set out 
upon the sea for Italy. Do not be distressed; I shall not 
remain there long. My health compels me to spend some time 
in a warm country. I will come back to you as soon as pos- 
sible. You know well that I do not like to live far from my 
little urchins,—so charming, both of them—whom I. love more 
than all the world. I would like well to_haveyou_with me, 
and take you everywhere I go; but your sister is not big enough; 
and you must not neglect your education. 
You know, my dear child, this [education] is indispensable; 
and you have decided to give yourself to it with all your heart. 
I was very happy when M. Gaillard told me that you were a 
fine boy; that you did your best to satisfy your masters; and 
that he had a good opinion of you. It is thus, I hope, that 
they will always speak to me of you. You have never given 
me any trouble in this respect; and you can make the happi- 
ness of my life, if you wish it. 
This morning I went to walk on the edge of the sea. I ate 
some shell-fish, all alive, and the shells of them were very 
pretty. I thought of you who like them so much; and I did 
not care to search for them in the sand, because you were not 
there to help me, and it was not amusing without you. When 
195

you are old enough to leave college, and interrupt your studies, 
we will travel together. You remember that we have already 
travelled together, and that we amused ourselves like two good 
comrades. We were afraid of nothing, neither one of us. We 
ate like two hungry wolves; and you slept like a top upon my 
knees. 
While we are waiting for the time when we shall begin these 
travels again, you must hasten to learn all that it is necessary 
for everyone to know. You must have suitable recreation. Be 
very polite to my mother and to Madame Dudevant when you 
visit them. Thank Boucoiran, who is so good and kind to 
you, very heartily; and write of all your comings and goings. 
Tell me what you have done, at whose house you have slept, 
etc. Tell me also if you have good marks. Think of me of- 
ten; and work, play, leap, take care of yourself, brush your hair, 
wash your hands, do not be too greedy, and love well your old 
mother who embraces you a thousand times. 
7. TO THE SAME 
Parts, July 16, 1834. 
I am finally quite settled at my home, my little love. I have 
three pretty little rooms facing the river, with a magnificent 
view and a balcony. When you come to see me, you will 
amuse yourself by seeing the soldiers march past and watch- 
ing the firemen. ‘There is a post opposite, and every time that 
a gendarme appears, these poor fireman are obliged to run 
to their guns. As this happens very often, they have not one 
minute of rest during the day; and the passers-by amuse them-_ 
selves by teasing them. You will see also the towers of Notre- 
Dame which are all covered with swallows. There are figures 
of devils in stone all around the walls; and the birds hide in 
their mouths and build their nests there.

I saw your cousin Oscar yesterday. He is very well-

you, and you would have played together; but it is time that 
he learns what you already know. You will be very glad, when 
you enter school, to have had good lessons beforehand. You 
will have less difficulty than the other boys of your age; and 
you will see that it is a great happiness to have been forced 
to work. 
Write me then, my dear child. Your last letter was very 
good. It gave me great pleasure; and I have kissed it many 
times. If you were here, my little one, I would bite your

each other in mind and in appearance. I know, from this 
day on, what your intellectual life will be. I fear for you the 
deepest sorrows; I hope for you the purest joys. Guard in 
yourself the treasure of goodness. Learn how to give with- 
out hesitation, to lose without regret, to acquire without mean- 
ness. Learn to put the happiness of those you love into your 
heart in place of the happiness which has failed you. Cherish 
the hope of another life; it is there that mothers find again their 
sons. Love all the creatures of God; pardon those who are

Love me. I would teach you many things if we lived to- 
gether. If we never have this happiness,—the greatest that 
could come to me, the only one that makes me desire long life, 
—you must pray to God for me; and, from the bosom of death, 
if there remains in the universe anything of me, the shadow 
of your mother will watch over you.

FELIX MENDELSSOHN-BARTHOLDY (1809-1847), the famous 
composer of Elijah, Songs Without Words, and many other musi- 
cal compositions, was a member of an exceedingly gifted family. 
His grandfather was Moses Mendelssohn, the philosopher, and 
his father a man of unusual mental ability. Felix was re- 
markable from early childhood, not only for his music, but for 
his general culture. His sister, Fanny, was almost equally 
gifted. Fortunately, some of the letters the father wrote to his 
four children have survived through the years, and give us an 
interesting picture of the life and interests of this unusual 
family. Later, Felix, a boy of only eleven years, writes a 
most delightful letter about his visit to Weimar and his meeting 
the poet, Goethe.

you only speak about the theatre. You are now old enough to 
find subjects to write to me about, not only in the daily events, 
but also in your thoughts. I should like to hear now and then 
what ideas your occupations awaken in you. As long as I was 
at home, for instance, mother told me much about your lessons 
with the clergyman. You should do that yourself now; so that 
I may see by your letters, now that I cannot personally watch 
it, what influence his teaching has on your heart and mind. 
Above all, let it be that of more and more strengthening your 
endeavor to please your loving and revered mother, and to arrive 
through obedience at love, through order and discipline at free- 
dom and happiness. That is the best way of thanking and 
worshipping the Creator, the Maker of us all. There are in all 
religions only one God, one virtue, one truth, one happiness. 
You will find all this, if you follow the voice of your heart; 
live so that it be ever in harmony with the voice of your reason.. 
You know from my letters to mother how I get on. Daily 
and hourly do I think of you in true affection.

They are carefully and well written, and you have at last dis- 
covered the secret to write to me about yourself and the others 
with real sense and feeling—and not about the theatre. I do 
not often bestow praise, but I do so the more conscientiously

say. I hope the best is still to come. 
Do not be vexed with your stoutness; it is one more resem- 
blance to your mother (and you can never be enough like her, 
for there is not her superior). When quite young, she was 
also very stout, and I hope she will be so again. I cannot 
recommend you to resemble me, for in the character of a woman 
I have charm only in tableaux vivants. 
Paul’s account of his ‘joys and sorrows’ has given infinite 
amusement. I am sorry to say that Fanny Sebastiani be- 
trayed no sign of jealousy; her love for him is perfectly 
unselfish. 
Give Rebecca and the boys if they will hold still, a kiss 
from me. I will add a few lines to each.

First to you, dear Paul! I have been very well satisfied with

same way; keep your fingers loose and sit upright. I have 
not at once answered your question regarding your marriage 
to Mieke, because I wanted to consider the matter. Now I 
think we will wait till I come home, so that I may see Mieke 
first. If I find her properly washed and you are a good boy 
for a fortnight, we can speak about it. 
You, my dear Felix, must state exactly what kind of paper 
you wish to have; ruled or not ruled, and if the former you must 
say distinctly how it is to be ruled. I went into a shop the 
other day to buy some, I found that I did not know myself 
what I wanted to have. Read over your letter before you send 
it off, and ascertain whether, if addressed to yourself, you could 
fully understand it and execute the commission contained in it.

You, dear Rebecca, have not written to me for a long time, 
and shall not have a letter from me. You must be content with 
a kiss or a fillip—on paper. By-the-by, your last letter was a 
downright scrawl; I dare say the farm-quills are to blame for 
it. 
I beg to remind mother of the drilling-master for all of you. 
I think a good one might be found at Neufchatel. Felix must 
dilligently practise swimming, but only in the swimming school. 
I hope the prohibition of gymnastics will not extend to our 
innocent place.

3. TO THE FAMILY FROM FELIX MENDELSSOHN 
WEIMAR, November 6, 1821. 
. . . Now listen, all of you. To-day is Tuesday. On Sun- 
day, the Sun of Weimar, Goethe, arrived. We went to church 
in the morning, and heard half of Handel’s music to the 100th 
Psalm. The organ, though large, is weak; that of St. Mary’s 
church is smaller but much more powerful. The Weimar one 
has fifty stops, forty-four notes, and one thirty-two feet pipe. 
After church I wrote to you that little letter dated 4th instant, 
and went to the Elephant Hotel, where I made a sketch 
of Lucas Cranach’s house. Two hours later Professor Zelter 
came, calling out: ‘Goethe has come; the old gentleman has 
come!’ We instantly hurried downstairs and went to Goethe’s 
house. He was in the garden, just coming round a hedge. 
Isn’t it strange, dear father—just the same as it happened 
with you! He is very kind, but I do not think any of his 
portraits like him. He then went through his interesting col- 
lection of fossils, which has been newly arranged by his son, 
and said repeatedly; ‘H’m, h’m, I am quite satisfied.’ After

that I walked in the garden with him and Professor Zelter, for 
about half an hour. Then we went to dinner. He does not 
look like a man of seventy-three, rather of fifty. After dinner, 
Fraulein Ulrike, Frau von Goethe’s sister, asked him for a 
kiss, and I followed her example. Every morning I have a 
kiss from the author of Faust and Werther, and every 
afternoon two kisses from the father and friend Goethe. Think 
of that! In the afternoon I played to Goethe for about two 
hours, partly fugues of Bach and partly improvisations. In 
the evening they arranged a whist table, and Professor Zelter, 
who took a hand, said: ‘Whist means, that you are to hold 
your tongue.’ There’s one of his good expressions for you. 
We all had supper together, even Goethe, who does n’t generally 
take it. Now something for you, my dear coughing Fanny! 
Yesterday I took your songs to Frau von Goethe, who has a 
good voice and will sing them to the old gentleman. I told 
him that you had written them, and asked him whether he 
would like to hear them. He said, ‘Yes, yes, with pleasure.’ 
Frau von Goethe likes them very much indeed, and that is a 
good omen. ‘To-day or to-morrow he is to hear them.

Martin LuTHER (1483-1546), the reformer, was born in 
Eisleben, Germany. He was the son of humble peasants and 
so poor, in his boyhood, that he sometimes sang in the streets 
for money to pay his schooling. His parents were sternly 
religious, and repressed in him all the joy and gaiety of child- 
hood. In after life, he lavished on his own children an un- 
stinted wealth of affection, remembering what he himself had 
lacked. His love of home and his children, and his apprecia- 
tion of nature were his strongest personal traits. He wrote 
some beautiful hymns and a tender Christmas carol beginning

  “Away in a manger, no crib for a bed, 
The little Lord Jesus laid down his sweet head. 
The stars in the bright sky looked down where 
he lay— 
The little Lord Jesus asleep on the hay.” 
The letter which follows was written to his little son Hans, 
who was then four years old. 
TO HIS SON, HANS LUTHER 
To My Dear Son, Hans LuTHER: Grace and peace in 
Christ, my darling little son. I am very glad to hear that you 
are studying well and praying diligently. Go on doing so, 
my little son, and when I come home I will bring you a beautiful 
present. 
I know a lovely, pretty garden, where there are many chil- 
dren. They wear golden coats, and pick up fine apples, pears, 
cherries, and plums under the trees. They. sing and jump 
and are very merry. They also have beautiful little horses 
with bridles of gold and saddles of silver. I asked the man 
who owned the garden who the children were. He answered, 
“These are the children who gladly pray and study and are 
good.” Then I said, ‘‘Dear man, I also have a son named 
Hans Luther. Would n’t he like to come into the garden and 
eat such beautiful apples and pears and ride such fine horses 
and play with these children!” Then the man said, “If he 
prays and studies gladly, and is good, he too shall come into 
the garden, and Lippus and Jost with him. And when they 
are all here they shall have whistles and drums and lutes, 
and all sorts of things to make music with, and they shall 
dance and shoot with little crossbows.” And he showed me 
a beautiful meadow in the garden fixed for dancing. Gold

whistles were hung there, and drums and silver crossbows. 
But it was still early and the children had not yet eaten, so I 
could n’t wait for the dance, and I said to the man: “Dear 
sir, I will go as fast as I can and write it all to my dear son 
Hans, that he may study and pray well and be good and so 
come into this garden. But he has an Aunt Lena whom he 
will have to bring with him.” ‘Then the man said, “Very 
well, go and write it to him.” 
Therefore, dear little son Hans, study and pray. bravely, 
and tell Lippus and Jost to do so too, and you shall all come into 
the garden with each other. The dear God take care of you. 
Greet Aunty Lena and give her a kiss for me. 
Your loving father,

    THE ART OF LETTER-WRITING 
READING such letters as are represented in this volume is a 
pleasant and profitable experience. ‘They are delightful in- 
troductions to people who are worth knowing. In fact, almost 
all our associations with letters are pleasant. We like to 
receive letters; we like to hear the postman’s whistle or ring; 
we notice the stamp on a letter; we even speculate about the 
handwriting. Probably there is no one so strong-minded as 
not to have looked at the outside of a letter and wondered who 
wrote it when the question could be answered by opening the 
envelope. It follows, then, that anything capable of giving so 
much pleasure as letter-writing should be studied and the art 
acquired. 
One of the first steps in learning to write letters that others 
will appreciate is to read good letters. ‘There are many reasons 
for reading letters, the most important being the pleasure they 
give us. However, in addition to sheer enjoyment, letters make 
us acquainted with people whose personalities challenge our at- 
tention, for a good letter is like the person who writes it. 
Letters make us acquainted with far-off times and places; 
Stevenson writes from the South Pacific Seas; Joel Chandler 
Harris from Georgia; and Mark Twain from every corner of 
Europe. Letters of travel present geography in a most vivid 
manner. 
Letters are the best kind of history, too. Such, letters as 
those of Franklin, Irving, Mendelsohn tell us how people lived 
in former times,—what they thought, how they dressed, how they 
amused themselves, and what they read and enjoyed. But per- 
haps best of all, letters make us understand other people and 
205
-P-A-G-E-230
  A BOOK OF LETTERS 
therefore help us to a better understanding of ourselves. 
Charles Lamb loved London with all his soul; Wordsworth 
had a similar affection for lakes, and mountains, and streams. 
Phillips Brooks and his little niece formed a conspiracy—very 
private—about Christmas gifts. George Sand enjoys her little 
girl’s pleasure in the Zodlogical Gardens. Letters make us 
think about the differences in people, to appreciate these dif- 
ferences, and to rejoice that we are not all cut according to the 
same pattern. 
It gives us peculiar pleasure to see accounts of our own ex- 
periences in the letters of other people. We see our experiences 
in a new light when we realize that others have thought and 
felt as we have and have written about their thoughts and feel- 
ings in letterssthat have become a part of literature. The 
letters of great letter-writers stimulate us to better expression, 
for their letters show us just how our own everyday experiences 
have served as material or “copy” for pleasant, readable letters. 
Almost everybody writes two kinds of letters, social, friendly 
letters and business letters. After one leaves school, he may’ 
not write compositions called descriptions, narrations, exposi- 
tions, and arguments, but he will write letters. Almost every 
letter possesses certain marks or characteristics. Every letter 
should have a clear, unmistakable purpose. It should have one 
thread of thought running through it, and not several different 
thoughts. A good letter is conversational in tone; it is very 
much like what you would say, if you had the opportunity to 
talk instead of write. If a letter is conversational in tone, it 
will probably have another quality that we expect to find in all 
good letters,—it will be suitable to the person who receives it. 
It will be adjusted to him and not to some one else. It will 
have the quality that Jane Carlyle had in mind when she wrote, 
“T want a letter all from yourself all to myself.” 
Now, a letter may have 
206

THE ART OF LETTER-WRITING 
so 
1. A clearly defined purpose 
2. Unity of idea 
3. Adaptation to the reader 
4. A conversational tone 
and yet fail to be a good letter, if it lack that something called 
“style.” Style is one’s own manner of expression; it is the man, 
the writer, himself. The word, style, suggests readable sen- 
tences, well chosen words, and original phrasing. 
In the last place, the kind of paper one uses should be ap- 
propriate to the occasion. People of good taste do not write 
business letters on note-paper. Certain kinds of letters should 
be typewritten; others should not be; these are matters of 
correct social usage. 
There are many kinds of letters; however, there are certain 
kinds that almost everyone has occasion to write; for example, 
I. Friendly, social letters 
1. Letters that contain news about one’s self 
. Letters of thanks for hospitality, “bread and butter 
letters” 
. Letters of invitation, acceptance, and declination 
. Letters of thanks for gifts 
. Letters of introduction 
. Letters that express sympathy 
II. Business letters 
1. Letters of inquiry for information 
2. Letters about matters that need adjusting, fume 
called “complaint letters” 
3. Letters ordering goods, service, books, magazines, 
newspapers Do nm Rh W 
It is a good plan to make the most of every experience you 
have that calls for a letter, and practice writing the letter de-

manded by the situation. In addition, set yourself some letter 
problems and try to solve them just as you solve problems in 
mathematics. Your teachers and classmates and friends will 
let you know whether you “get the answer,” if you are in doubt. 
One parting word of advice: revise your work; be your own 
critic first and then invite criticism. ‘The art of writing and 
the habit of revision constitute an inseparable pair. Below you 
will find a few letter problems which will suggest others to you. 
‘Try to write to real people about real experiences and situations. 
1. One of your classmates has been absent from school for 
several days on account of illness. Write your friend a 
news letter. ) 
2. You have just returned from a pleasant visit in the home 
of one of your friends. Write a letter to your friend’s 
mother, expressing your appreciation of all that was done 
for your comfort and pleasure. 
3. You have just received a present,—something that you 
wanted very much. Write a letter of thanks, expressing 
your enthusiastic appreciation. 
4. You have just read a book that you liked. You think 
that your friend would like it. Write a letter about the 
book but do not “tell the whole story.” 
5. One of your classmates expects to spend the vacation in 
a place where an old friend of your lives. Write a letter 
of introduction to your friend. Try to show in your letter 
what the two friends have in common. 
6. Spin out on interesting ‘letter about “nothings.” Some 
letter-writers, like Charles Lamb and Horace Walpole, 
wrote their best letters about dullness, routine, in fact, 
about nothing. 
7. Perhaps you have recently had an interesting trip. Write 
a letter about your travels. 
208

THE ART OF LETTER-WRITING 
8. You wish to subscribe for St. Nicholas. Write to The 
10. Century Company, 353 Fourth Avenue, New York City, 
ordering the magazine for a year. 
. Your monthly bill has just come from a department store. 
You find that you are charged by mistake with goods that 
you did not order. Write to the firm, enclosing your check 
in payment of your bill and calling attention to the error. 
You ordered a sweater, size 16. You wish to wear it in 
an inter-class basketball tournament. ‘The sweater de- 
livered was size 18. Unless your order can be filled 
correctly by a given date, you will not need the sweater 
this season. Write the letter called for by the situation. 
Whenever you have a letter problem to solve, examine collec- 
tions of letters to see how a similar problem has been solved by 
some other letter-writer.

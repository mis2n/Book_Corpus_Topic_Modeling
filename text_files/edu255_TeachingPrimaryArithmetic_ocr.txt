INTRODUCTION 
BY DAVID EUGENE SMITH 
Tue evolution of the teaching of primary arith- 
metic extends over a period of about two hundred 
years, although numerous sporadic efforts at 
teaching the science of number to young child- 
ren had been made long before the founding 
of the Francke Institute at Halle. During the 
eighteenth century not much progress was made 
until there was established the Philanthropin at 
Dessau, and perhaps it would be more just to 
speak of primary arithmetic as having its real be- 
ginning in this institution at about the time that 
our country was establishing its independent ex- 
istence. It is, however, to Pestalozzi, at the be- 
ginning of the nineteenth century, that we 
usually and rightly assign the first sympathetic 
movement in this direction, and it is the period 
from that time to the present that has seen the 
real evolution of the teaching of arithmetic to 
children in the first school years.

  INTRODUCTION 
The evolution of this phase of education is one 
of the most interesting and profitable studies 
that a teacher of arithmetic can undertake. It re- 
veals the experiments, many of them puerile but 
a few of them virile, that have been made from 
time to time; it brings into light the failures 
which should serve as warnings, and the suc- 
cesses which will inspire the teacher to better 
and more carefully considered effort ; it shows the 
trend of primary instruction, and it makes the 
student of education more sympathetic with the 
great problem before him. In particular, he will 
see the danger of narrowness in matters of 
' method, the futility of expecting to create genu- 
ine interest by any single line of devices, the 
pitiful results that came from over-emphasis of 
the doctrine of formal discipline, and the errors 
of judgment that have been made in deciding 
upon what constitutes reality in an arithmetical 
problem for children. If by such a study he 
should see the childishness of confining one’s 
self to the use of cubes alone, or of some special 
type of number chart, or of some particular form 
of number cards, or of sticks of varied lengths or 
vi

  INTRODUCTION 
shapes, the result would be salutary. If by his 
study of the absurd extreme to which formal dis- 
cipline was carried a generation ago he is led to 
see the equal absurdity to which so many teach- 
ers are tending to-day —the denying that any 
such discipline exists at all — his labor will bear 
good fruit in the school room of the present. 
It fortunately happens that after this century 
of experiment we are getting about ready to take 
some account of stock; to weigh up values; to 
select from what the world has produced, and to 
select with some approach to good judgment. It 
is not probable that the time is entirely ripe for 
this labor, because we are at present in the midst 
of a period of agitation that seems certain to warp 
our judgment, the period of agitation for a some- 
what narrow phase of industrial education ; but 
even with this danger we are better able to 
weigh up the values in the teaching of arith- 
metic than we have ever been before. One rea- 
son for this is that we now have men and women 
of sufficiently sound education and sufficiently 
broad view to attack the problem. These men 
appreciate the efforts of Pestalozzi, but they 
vil

  INTRODUCTION 
recognize that these are to the present what 
the science of Franklin is to that of Kelvin and 
Thompson. They appreciate what Tillich did for 
number work, and the influence of Grube; but 
they know that these men were narrow in view 
and dogmatic in statement, and that they stand 
rather as warnings than as founders of any 
worthy theory. 
In looking for such a man to prepare a report 
upon the teaching of arithmetic in the primary 
grades, the American members of the Interna- 
tional Commission on the Teaching of Mathe- 
matics turned first of all to Professor Suzzallo? 
They felt that his standing as a scholar, his ex- 
perience as a practical school man, and his posi- 
tion in the educational world fitted him perfectly 
for a work of this importance. That their good 
judgment did not fail them will be seen in read- 
ing the following report. In it Professor Suzzallo 
1 The material presented in this study was originally col- 
lected and organized for the purposes of a special report to 
a sub-committee of the International Commission on the 
Teaching of Mathematics, This commission was created at the 
International Congress of Mathematicians held in Rome in 
1908. The report, was first published in the 7zachers College 
Record, March, 1911.

has set forth very clearly the aims of instruction 
in primary arithmetic, rightly considering these 
aims in their evolutionary rather than in their 
static aspects, emphasizing the importance of 
this phase of the study, and showing the present 
tendencies that séem making for a more rational 
view of teaching. He has discarded the narrow 
and trivial concept of method that characterized 
the educational work of a generation now passing 
away, and has brought dignity to the term by 
considering it from the modern scientific stand- 
point. He has discussed both historically and 
psychologically the important question of object 
teaching, showing the failures that have resulted 
from narrow views of the purpose of such an 
aid and the success that may be expected from 
a more rational use of number material. The 
whole question of the réle of reason, or rather of 
the pupil’s effort to express the rationalizing pro- 
cess has been considered, the extreme danger 
points have been indicated, and the bearing of 
some of our saner forms of psychology upon the 
subject has been set forth. The technique of num- 
ber, including the question of accuracy and speed

in the operations, has also been treated in a very 
acceptable manner, Professor Suzzallo’s experi- 
ence in this phase of work having been unusual. 
And finally, the vexed question of what consti- 
tutes a genuinely concrete problem has been con- 
sidered in its various bearings, and the present 
tendencies in problem-making have been indi- 
| cated, It is needless to say that the last word has 
not been spoken on this phase of the work, and 
that it never will be. New generations produce 
new lines of application of arithmetic, even for 
children. But with respect to the general prin- 
ciples of the selection of matter for the framing 
of problems, Professor Suzzallo speaks with a con- 
viction that will carry weight. 
With all of the opinions expressed in such a 
report probably no reader will agree. It would be 
a poor discussion that would not provoke some 
opposition. But with the general tenor of the 
report it is certain that most thinking teachers 
of to-day will find themselves in hearty accord. 
More important still is the fact that the report 
sets forth in clear language the present status of 
primary arithmetic in the more thoughtful edu-

THE SCOPE OF THE STUDY 
Ir is the function of this study to convey some 
notion of the methods employed in teaching math- 
ematics in the first six grades of the American 
elementary school. No attempt is made to givea 
minute description of the endless details of 
teaching procedure, nor even to enumerate all 
the types of teaching method employed. Its 
purpose is restricted to an analysis of the larger 
tendencies in teaching practice which are repre- 
sentative of the spirit of mathematical instruction 
in the lower schools. 
Function of the Study to Trace General Tendencies 
We should havea much simpler task if it were 
ours to sketch the purposes of mathematical in- 
struction, or to outline the nature and organiza- 
tion of the various mathematical courses of study. 
As it is, we have to describe something less con- 
crete, namely the method employed in the pre-

sentation of mathematical subjects. Intimately 
dependent upon the subject matter involved, 
dominated by the special aims of mathematical 
instruction in a non-technical school, adjusted to 
the immaturities of childhood, and reflecting the 
personal habits of mind of the teacher, — teach- 
ing method emerges —a powerful, variable, and 
subtle thing. In spite of subtlety and variability 
there are, however, certain general practices 
that can be described and analyzed. It is with 
these that this study will deal. 
Teaching Method is a Mode of Presentation 
Owing to the existing confusions, it is well at 
the very outset to have in mind a clear definition 
of the term “teaching methods.” Teaching 
methods are always methods of presentation. In 
this respect the teaching art is like any other 
art, literary, graphic, plastic, or what not. The 
literary artist, for example, has a purpose, a sub- 
ject matter, a particular audience, and a special 
style of presentation. All these factors are pre- 
sent in the teaching art. The aims of instruction, 
the particular facts to be taught, the immaturity 
2
-P-A-G-E-15
  THE SCOPE OF THE STUDY 
of the child taught, and the inevitable personality 
of the teacher determine the style of instruc- 
tion, or, to. use our own “trade word,” a 
method of teaching. Every teacher, then, has 
a style or method —conscious or unconscious, 
good, bad, or indifferent. Unlike the literary 
artist, he has many ends to serve rather than one. 
His functions are general to life, and include 
moral, social, and personal ends, as well as those 
that are esthetic. His methods of communica- 
tion, too, are more than one. He presents his ex- 
periences objectively and graphically, as well as 
through the medium of written words and speech. 
) Always the teacher’s end is to stimulate growth 
through the presentation of experiences. / When 
“that presentation takes a form and order differ- 
ent from that usual to adult life for the precise 
_purpose of making the fact more readily compre- 
hensible to the immature mind of the child, then 
that modification may be called a method of 
teaching. Teaching methods are always special 
manners of readjusting adult wisdom to the 
special psychological conditions of a student’s 
mind.
-P-A-G-E-16
TEACHING PRIMARY ARITHMETIC 
Distinct Uniformities Exist among tts Variations 
In the concrete, methods of teaching are always 
specialized responses to situations, and as variable 
as situations are variable. Life is never just the 
same at any point. Yet certain essential similari- 
ties exist and give us the opportunity to inter- 
pret life in terms of law. The same may be said 
of the teaching life. In a sense it never repeats 
itself; yet to the degree that the same end, the 
same subject matter, and the same immaturity of 
mind recur in class rooms, teachers will tend to 
use similar modes of adjustment. In describing 
mathematical teaching in the primary schools, it 
is these similar modes of teaching adjustment, 
these similar “general methods,” that we shall 
describe and analyze. 
The Methods of Public Elementary Schools are 
Representative 
It will be unnecessary to have a separate 
treatment of the “general methods” of mathe- 
matical teaching for public schools and private 
schools. Whatever may be said of the state-sup-

THE SCOPE OF THE STUDY 
ported schools will in general be true of private 
institutions. It is true of elementary schools as 
it is not of secondary and higher schools, that 
private institutions hold a relatively minor place, 
as compared with public or state schools. They 
are in a sense mere adjuncts to the public school 
system, claiming, in the generality of cases, no 
real difference in their ideals and methods of in- 
struction. In the larger number of cases they 
draw their courses of study and methods from 
the public school systems of the immediate neigh- 
borhood. The social status of the parent or the 
personal incapacity of the child, rather than 
difference of school methods, is the cause of the 
special clientage of the private primary schools in 
the United States. Hence, a description of the 
characteristic methods of the public schools will 
be representative of the prevailing modes of in- 
struction in American private elementary schools,

of the elementary school concerns itself almost 
exclusively with the teaching of arithmetic. A

decade or so ago there was a vigorous movement 
for the introduction of algebra and geometry 
into the elementary school. As a result, these 
subjects made their appearance in the seventh 
and eighth grades—seldom in the first six 
school years, Where the influence of this move- 
ment penetrated the lower grades or persisted 
in the higher grades, the algebraic and geometric 
elements involved were so restricted and simpli- 
fied that they became part and parcel of the 
subject of arithmetic, rather than the elemen- 
tary phases of two more advanced subjects. This 
is true of the simple algebraic equation or the 
measurement of simple geometric figures where 
introduced below the seventh year. 
Elementary Arithmetic Emphasizes the Four 
Fundamental Processes 
By common practice, even the arithmetic 
taught in the primary grades has been given a 
restrictive emphasis, For the most part it is con- 
cerned with the mastery of the fundamental pro- 
cesses in manipulating integers and fractions,

of study, will note that in the lower grades the 
mathematical subjects taught are named after 
the abstract process involved rather than after 
the particular business institution to which the 
arithmetic is concretely applied, Thus in the 
lower grades we teach counting, subtraction, 
fractions, decimals, percentage, etc.; while in 
the higher grades we teach interest, stocks and 
bonds, commission, insurance, etc. There is of 
course no hard and fast line of demarcation ; one 
emphasis gradually passes over into the other, 
an approximate balance being maintained in the 
intermediate grades. It will perhaps simplify the 
task of this study and make its treatment more 
thoroughly representative of all conditions, if 
the general methods described be restricted 
to that field which is most characteristic of the 
first five or six years of mathematical instruction, 
namely, to the teaching of the fundamental pro- 
cesses of manipulating integers and fractions 
along with their simple applications to concrete 
problems. This discussion, then, will be limited 
to the period of school life in which the tools of 
arithmetic are acquired.

  TEACHING PRIMARY ARITHMETIC 
The Need for Studying Exceptional Reform 
Tendencies ; 
While the aspects of mathematical instruction 
here studied and presented are selected because 
of their representative nature, it would be un- 
wise to restrict ourselves to a statement of the 
commonly accepted procedures of school-room 
practice. There are in America certain reform 
tendencies which are as characteristic of condi- 
tions as are the conservative practices. These 
modifying forces need to be mentioned along 
with the practices that they alter. Again, there 
are certain scientific effects now well under 
way to study the problem of methods in teach- 
ing. While these have, as their immediate aim, 
the acquisition of new knowledge rather than di- 
rect educational reform, their ultimate effect will 
be to change methods of teaching, For this reason 
they are important, and have a proper place in 
this presentation.

THE INFLUENCE OF AIMS ON TEACHING 
Factors Influencing Teaching Methods 
Ir has been suggested that all teaching methods 
represent adjustments to several variable factors 
in the school-room situation. Teaching method 
is never, or should not be, just one thing. It is as 
variable as the factors that determine its situa- 
tion. The purposes of mathematical instruction, - 
the nature of the fact to be taught, the imma- 
turity of the child, the teacher’s scholarly equip- 
ment, his personality, his attitude toward the 
very idea or institution of method, —all these are 
influences in determining the status of mathe- 
matical teaching. Some of them are so important 
that it will be necessary to discuss them in de- 
tail at the very outset. 
The Influence of a Scientific Aim 
The purposes of mathematical instruction in 
the elementary school must always be very in-

-P-A-G-E-22
  TEACHING PRIMARY ARITHMETIC 
fluential upon method. It makes a great differ- 
ence whether one is merely teaching the elements 
of mathematics or is teaching mathematics as a 
tool for business life. It has not been long since 
the aim of mathematical teaching was merely 
scientific. The facts taught were the beginning 
of a science, and the end was to obtain a foun- 
dation for more advanced facts of the same kind, 
which were dependent upon this foundation. As 
the teacher had learned his mathematics, so he 
taught the subject. To a considerable degree, as 
the master’s adult mind classified the facts of the 
subject, so he presented it to the child. His 
methods were logical rather than psychological, 
He gave the finished product or process to the 
child without special adaptation to the child’s 
immaturity; a roundabout method that slowly 
approximated and only finally achieved the full 
result was with such a teacher exceptional. 
Such a scientific aim, implicit rather than ex- 
pressed, dominated the methods of teaching when 
arithmetic was handed over to the elementary 
schools by the higher institutions of education. 
The first purpose to be rooted in the traditions 
Io
-P-A-G-E-23
INFLUENCE ®F AIMS ®N TEACHING 
of mathematical teaching, it still persists with 
all the rigidity of a conservative force. Teachers 
still tend to teach future workmen in the lower 
schools as they themselves were taught by sci- 
entific scholars in the universities. And high 
school and college instructors still impose their 
standards upon the lower schools so as to influ- 
ence their methods of instruction. As higher in-- 
struction still remains largely scientific in purpese 
and method, its effects reinforce the earliest tra- 
dition in the elementary schools. Under such 
an influence, the worth of a mathematical fact is 
measured by its place in a logical scheme, rather 
than by its significance and recurrence in every- 
day life. The mathematician may need to know 
all about the names of the places in notation and 
numeration ; the layman cares only about the ac- 
curate reading and writing of numbers, and not 
at all about the verbal title of “units of thou- 
sands” place. Again the rational needs of a stu- 
dent of mathematics may require an understand- 
ing of the reasons why we “carry” in column 
addition, but the effective everyday use demands 
an accurate Aadit of “carrying” rather than an 
It
-P-A-G-E-24
  TEACHING PRIMARY ARITHMETIC 
accurate explanation. Yet just such methods 
persist in our schools because of the domination 
of a scientific treatment of the subject. 
The Influence of the Aim of Formal Discipline 
The remoteness of such mathematical teach- 
ing from the needs of common life constantly 
threatens the loyalty and support of the public. 
Some defense becomes necessary on other than 
scientific grounds. Such a sanction could not be 
found in utilitarianism, for the waste was evi- 
dent. It remained for a psychological theory to 
sketch a defense upon “disciplinary” grounds, 
The doctrine of “formal discipline” says that 
such mathematical teaching trains the powers of 
the mind so that any mastery gained in mathe- 
matics is a mastery operating in full elsewhere, 
regardless of the remoteness of the new situa- 
tions from those in connection with which the 
power or ability was originally acquired) The facts 
and processes mastered may not be those most 
needed in daily life, but they are good for every 
man inasmuch as they train his mind, Such was 
the dictum of the doctrine of “formal discipline.” 
12
-P-A-G-E-25
  INFLUENCE OF AIMS ON TEACHING 
The effect of such doctrine is to defend and 
perpetuate every obsolete, unimportant, and 
wasteful practice in the teaching of mathematics. 
o matter that partnership as taught in the 
schools had its original sanction in its close cor- 
respondence to the reality of business practice; 
no matter that the old sanction has passed ; 
teach it now for its ability to discipline the mind ! 
No matter that “life insurance” touches more 
men than “cube root” ; the latter should be kept 
because of its power to train the mind, In life, 
where “approximation” of amounts suffices, the 
teacher demands absolute accuracy, and the eth- 
ical worth of such precise truth is the high law 
for its defense. In life, “the butcher, the baker, 
and the candlestick maker” figure out the total 
of a bill mainly “in their heads,” with a few ac- 
cessory pencil scribbles upon paper; the teacher 
finds sanction in zsthetics for requiring a com- 
plete statement written or re-written in exquisite 
form. Regardless of the truth that is concealed 
in the doctrine of “formal discipline,” it must be 
confessed by those who know the history of 
teaching method in the United States that it is 
13
-P-A-G-E-26
  TEACHING PRIMARY ARITHMETIC 
the main defense of conservatism and the larg- 
est cause of waste in teaching methods. 
The Shiftin Emphasis from Academic to 
Social Aims 
Such has been the ground upon which recent 
educational reform has operated. Slowly the 
older scientific and disciplinary aims of instruc- 
tion have given way to the newer purposes of 
business utility and social insight. In that step 
a large transition has been covered. Before, the 
school measured the worth of its work by stand- 
ards internal to educational institutions. The 
schoolmaster and the scholar, rather than the 
man on the street, had formulated the scientific 
classifications of mathematics and expounded 
the doctrine of “formal discipline.” Thereafter, 
the measure of efficient school instruction was 
determined by standards external to the school, 
the product of conditions outside of school life. 
Business need and social situation determine 
whether a fact or a process is worth comprehend- 
ing, and whether the method of instruction has 
been effective. 
14
-P-A-G-E-27
  INFLUENCE OF AIMS ON TEACHING 
Business Utility as an End 
The utilitarianism that first attacked the older 
course of study and its methods was the utility of 
the business world. The arithmetic of business life 
became the standard. The practices of the market 
determined what matter, skill, and accuracy 
should be demanded of the elementary school 
pupil. Recently it became the habit to call upon 
the business man to give his opinion as to what 
constitutes good arithmetical training; and no 
criticism was so feared as that of the business 
leader who said that the boys that came to him 
were incompetent. Committees on courses of 
study have even investigated the relative fre- 
quency and importance of specific arithmetical 
processes in the business world with the idea of 
utilizing the results as a basis for changes in the 
mathematical curriculum. 
This aim of business utility, coming at a time 
when the elementary school course was felt to 
be overcrowded, met with a ready reception. It 
operated for the time being as the standard by 
which materials and methods in arithmetic were 
15
-P-A-G-E-28
  TEACHING PRIMARY ARITHMETIC 
to be eliminated, if not actually selected. Ma- 
terials not general to the business world, such 
as the table of Troy weight, were therefore 
eliminated. Processes of computing interest in- 
frequently used were supplemented by more 
widespread and up-to-date methods, More doing 
and less explaining characterized the instruction 
in adding columns of figures, and such manipu- 
lation mimicked the exact conditions of its use 
in the world at large. If strings of figures are 
usually added in vertical columns in the busi- 
ness world, then they should be taught in ver- 
tical columns more nearly exclusively than before. 
The obsolete and the relatively infrequent, the 
over-complex and the wasteful processes of the 
old arithmetic tended to disappear. More than 
any other influence, this aim of business utility 
has combated the over-conservative influence of 
scientific and disciplinary aims which dominated 
previous decades. The newer methods of teach- 
ing have kept the best of the old movements, 
The work is still scientific in that it is accurate; 
it is still disciplinary in that it trains; but the 
truth and the training which are given are 
16
-P-A-G-E-29
  
INFLUENCE OF AIMS ON TEACHING 
selected by and associated with actual business 
situations common to every-day life. 
Broad Social Utilitarianism as a Standard 
There is evidence in the present thought of 
teachers that a utility broader than that of the 
business world is beginning to obtain in the 
schools. Everywhere in these days the Ameri- 
can teacher and the educational writer speak of 
the social aims of education. More than ever be- 
fore, the social consciousness of the teacher en- 
larges. This general increase in the social con- 
sciousness of the teacher is reflected in mathe- 
matical instruction. 
In spite of an increasing movement toward 
specific vocational training, —as seen in the in- 
dustrial education movement, for example, — 
there has been a reactionary defense of the ele- 
mentary schools as an institution for very gen- 
eral training in the things that are socially fun- 
damental and common. This movement toward 
the preservation of the elementary school as a 
place for giving a broadly socialized and modern 
culture not only is checking the inroads of a 
17   
 
-P-A-G-E-30
    TEACHING PRIMARY ARITHMETIC 
narrow vocational education, but is broadening 
the conception of the older studies, of which 
arithmetic is but one. Arithmetic is not a sub- 
ject in which only the skills of calculation are 
cultivated; it is one that contributes social in- 
sight, just as history and geography do. 
The influence of the social aim of instruction 
upon mathematical instruction is subtle but ob- 
vious. The business man’s opinion with refer- 
ence to arithmetical instruction is not always 
taken as gospel. There are other standards. 
“Why,” says the schoolmaster, “should I train 
people for your special needs, any more than for 
the demands of other trades that men ply? To 
be sure, our graduates do not fit perfectly into 
your shop at once. But that precise and local 
adjustment is the work of the business course 
or of shop apprenticeship. My function is to 
train men for the situations common to all men 
and special to no class. The elementary school 
is a school for general culture or social apprecia- 
tion, not a business college or a trade school.” 
The sociologist usurps the place of the business

INFLUENCE OF AIMS ON TEACHING 
Some Concrete Effects of the Change in Aim 
The immediate effect is that arithmetical ap- 
plications find a larger place in teaching. A 
saner relation is established between abstract 
examples and concrete problems. And the prob- 
lems, in increasing extent, are real problems, 
typical of life, if not actual. No more does arith- 
metic, in the best schools, confine itself to fig- 
ures alone. Figures are applied in concrete 
problems. There may be days of teaching when 
not a figure is used during the arithmetic period. 
The social setting, the business institution, which 
calls for the calculation, is studied as carefully 
as the process of calculation. (Che students are 
given a knowledge of banking as well as skill in 
the computation of interest. They may even 
visit a bank, a factory, a shop, as the case may 
require. Instead of having fifteen problems that 
deal with fifteen different subjects all more or 
less remote from one another, as was almost uni- 
versally the case with older text-books and teach- 
ing methods, the class hour may be given over to ~ 
fifteen problems related to one situation, such

as might develop in the business of a bakery 
shop or an apartment house. Thus arithmetic 
gradually gains social setting and unity. 
To-day teaching methods in arithmetic are in 
a state of transition : old and new purposes min- 
gle with unequal force and give us a mixed pro- 
cess of instructing. Old materials and methods 
still persist, for logical and disciplinary ideals 
still hold; but the newer regimen ushered in by 
the demands of business utility and social under- 
standing gains ground. The obsolete, the untrue, 
the wasteful methods pass from arithmetic teach- 
ing ; and the pressing, modern, and useful activi- 
ties and understandings enter. Arithmetic is less 
abstract and formal as a subject than it was; it” 
has become increasingly vital and concrete with 
real interests, insights, and situations. The grind 
of sheer mechanical drill decreases in teaching ; 
and a reasoned understanding of relations, in 
some degree at least, is substituted. Artificial mo- 
tives and incentives are less frequently used to 
get work done, while the quantitative needs of the 
child’s life and the intrinsic interest of children 
in the institutional occupations of their elders pro- 
vide a more vital motive for the use of arithmetic.

THE EFFECT OF THE CHANGING STATUS OF 
TEACHING METHOD 
Method as a Psychological Adjustment to 
the Child 
Art the very beginning, it was suggested that 
many factors enter into the nature of our teach- 
ing methods. There was occasion to show the 
effect of varying aims on the spirit and manner 
of instruction, for the end in view inevitably in- 
fluences any presentation of facts, in school or 
out. The most significant factor, however, in 
teaching method is the attempt to adjust meth- 
ods of presentation to the psychological con- 
ditions of childhood. Teaching method in the 
school is primarily a mode of presentation de- 
signed to stimulate the energies of children. As 
long as the teacher was the most active person 
in the classroom, method as such was not impor- 
tant in pedagogical theory. The focusing of at- 
tention on the child as an active human factor to 
21 
 
-P-A-G-E-34
  TEACHING PRIMARY ARITHMETIC 
be given careful consideration is responsible for 
the extended development of teaching technique, 
\Whe growing importance of “method” in educa- 
tional theory marks a growth in the teacher's 
consciousness of psychological factors, precisely 
as the appearance of the newer aims in teaching 
has marked an increased regard for social factors. 
The Effect of an Increased Reverence for 
Childhood 
Two important movements have been respon- 
sible for the development of a psychological con- 
sciousness of the pupil as a dominating factor 
in teaching method. One is humanitarian; the 
other, scientific. 
There has been a steady growth in reverence 
and sympathy for childhood. As yet it has 
scarcely expressed itself with fullness. Its pre- 
sence is revealed by the widespread enactment of 
laws designed to guarantee the rights of child- 
hood —laws against child labor and in favor of 
compulsory education. The growth of special 
courts for juvenile offenders, the development of 
playgrounds, and the decreased brutality of dis- 
22
-P-A-G-E-35
  
   
  CHANGING STATUS OF METHOD 
cipline at home and school, are other symptoms 
of the public attitude toward childhood. The 
wide acceptance of the “doctrine of interest” 
in teaching; the enrichment of the curriculum ; 
specialized schools for truants and defectives ; 
individual instruction, —these are the school- 
master’s recognition of the modern attitude to- 
childhood. Under such conditions teach- 
ing becomes less and less a ruthless external 
imposition of adult views, and more a means ‘war 
  of sympathetic ministry to those inner needs of 
child life which make for desirable qualities of 
haracter. While it is true that teaching method 
is a condescension to childhood, it is a socially 
profitable condescension in that it is a guarantee 
of more effective and enduring mastery of the 
life that is revealed at school. Since the child’s 
acquisition tends the more to be part and parcel 
of his own life under such sympathetic teaching, 
the products of such instruction are enduring. 
The Reconstruction of Method through Psychology 
Such a humanitarian movement naturally 
called for knowledge of the child—the wisdom 
23
-P-A-G-E-36
  TEACHING PRIMARY ARITHMETIC 
of common sense soon exhausts itself, and more 
scientific data are demanded. Thus the “child 
study movement” came into existence. The 
movement was in some degree disappointing, for 
frequently it busied itself in cataloguing the ob- 
vious rather than in classifying new and hitherto 
unexplained data. But one thing it did: it focused 
attention upon the child as the crucial factor 
in education, the prime conditioning force in all 
methods of instruction. Since then, a saner psy- 
chological foundation has been laid for educa- 
tional procedure, one which is criticising and 
reconstructing teaching method at every turn. 
Hitherto, teaching methods had been improved 
fitfully through a crude empiricism. As the 
ablest teachers’ became dissatisfied with their 
teaching and dared to vary their methods, they 
selected the successful experiments, and other 
teachers willingly adopted the methods that 
seemed better than their own. Now a body of 
general psychological knowledge, rich in its 
criticism of old methods and in its suggestion 
of new means of procedure, gives a scientific 
basis to teaching method. Where additional psy- 
24 
 
-P-A-G-E-37
  CHANGING STATUS OF METHOD 
chological knowledge is needed, the educational 
psychologists seek it through special investiga- 
tions. And where the counter claims of com- 
peting methods defy ordinary psychological 
analysis and investigation, judgment is sought 
through an experimental pedagogy which sub- 
mits teaching processes to comparative tests 
under normal classroom conditions. 
A 
The Increased Professional Respectability of 
Conscious Method 
Increased sympathy with childhood and in- 
creased scientific knowledge of human nature 
together give teaching method anew justification. 
The result is that the era of complete depend- 
ence upon teaching genius and mere common 
sense in methods of instruction has passed out 
of the American elementary school. We are now 
in a period where a specific professional tech- 
nique in teaching is demanded, a technique partly 
developed out of crude personal and professional 
experience, and partly founded upon scientific 
criticism and experiment. A new humanitarian 
and scientific attitude toward the mental life of 
25
-P-A-G-E-38
  TEACHING PRIMARY ARITHMETIC 
children elevates teaching method to a position 
it has never before enjoyed. 
The public elementary-school teacher is con- 
servative indeed who will deny that there is any- 
thing worthy in the notion of “method.” Asa 
class, teachers have faith in the special profes- 
sional technique which is included under the 
term. They are critical of the many abuses which 
have been committed in the name of method. 
Method cannot be a substitute for scholarship. 
It cannot be a “‘cut and dried” procedure indis- 
criminately or uniformly applied to class-room 
instruction. Like every other technical means, 
teaching method is subject to its own limitations 
and strengths, a fact which the average teacher 
recognizes. 
The Prevalence of Methods Emphasizing a 
Single Idea 
In spite of the fact that the majority of ele- 
mentary teachers keep reasonably sane on the 
problem of method in teaching, it must be ad- 
mitted that a considerable proportion of teachers 
are inclined to be attracted by systems of method 
26 
 
-P-A-G-E-39
  
CHANGING STATUS OF METHOD 
that greatly over-emphasize a single element of 
procedure. The hold which the “ Grube method,” 
with its unnatural logical thoroughness and 
progression, gained in this country two or 
three decades ago is scarcely explicable to-day. 
Scarcely less baffling is the very large appeal 
made by a series of textbooks which lays the 
stress upon the acquisition of arithmetic through 
the idea of ratio and by means of measuring. 
Manual work as the source of arithmetical ex- 
periences is another special emphasis, which, like 
the others, has had its enthusiastic adherents. 
Again it is “arithmetic without a pencil” or, 
some other over-extension of a legitimate loca’ 
method into a“ panacea” or “cure-all, @®hich con- 
fronts us. The promulgation @Ad acceptance of 
such unversatile and one-sid@d systems of teach- 
ing method are indicative of two defects in the 
professional equipment of teachers : (1) the lack v 
of a clear, scientific notion as to the nature and _ 
function of teaching method, and (2) the lack of “ 
psychological insight into the varied nature of 
class-room situations. Untrained teachers westill 
have among us, and others, too, to whom a little 
  27 
   
-P-A-G-E-40
  TEACHING PRIMARY ARITHMETIC 
knowledge is a dangerous thing. These are fre- 
quently carried away by the enthusiastic appeals 
of the reformer with a system far too simple to 
meet the complex needs of human nature. Our 
experiences seem to have sobered us somewhat, 
the increase of supervision has made responsible 
officers cautious, and increased professional in- 
telligence has put a wholesome damper upon 
naive and futile proposals to make teaching 
easy. 
The Tendency toward Over-Uniformity 
in Method 
A more serious evil than that just mentioned 
is the tenttncy of the supervising staff to over- 
prescribe specie for class-room teach- 
ers. Recently there has developed, more par- 
ticularly in large city systems, a tendency to 
demand a uniform mode of teaching the same 
school subject throughout the city. The prime 
causes of this tendency are to be found (1) in the 
specialization of grade teaching, and the conse- 
quent interdependence of one teacher on another; 
and (2) in the mobility of the school population, 
28 
 
-P-A-G-E-41
  CHANGING STATUS OF METHOD 
which involves considerable lost energy if teachers 
do not operate along similar lines. 
The result of such imposed uniformity is a 
reduction of spontaneity in teaching. The pro- 
cess of instruction proceeds in a more or less 
mechanical fashion, the teacher working for bulk 
results by a persistent and general application of 
the methods laid down. That teaching which at 
every moment tends to adjust itself skillfully to 
the changes of human doubt and interest, diffi- 
culty and success, discouragement and insight, 
now taking care of a whole group at once, now 
aiding an individual straggler, now resolutely 
following a prescribed lead, now pursuing a line 
of least resistance previously unsuspected, can- 
not thrive under such conditions. The demand 
for an excessive uniformity stifles teaching as 
a fine art, and makes of it a mechanical busi- 
ness; only those activities that fit the machine 
can go on. Thus it happens that we memorize, 
cram, drill, and review; and soon the subtler pro- 
cesses of thinking and evaluating, which are 
the best fruit of education, cease to exist.

  TEACHING PRIMARY ARITHMETIC 
Method as a Series of Varied, Particular 
Adjustments 
Fortunately the one-method system of teach- 
ing will soon belong to the past ; and fortunately, 
too, the imposition of uniform methods is begin- 
ning to lose ground, even in our cities, For the 
most part, the common sense of teachers and 
the positive statements of our better theorists 
keep teaching methods in a sane and useful 
status. Teaching methods should be as infinitely 
variable as the conditions calling for their use are 
endlessly changeable. Not one method but many 
are necessary, for methods are supplementary 
- rather than competitive. No one method should 
be used with a pre-established rigidity ; each must 
be flexible in its uses, so as to accomplish the 
varied work to be done. The teacher, with his 
everyday contact with the problems of child. 
hood, is the best interpreter of conditions and 
the best chooser of the tools of instruction. 
The supervisor may criticize, suggest, and ad- 
vise; he may call attention to fundamental prin- 
ciples involved; but the teacher himself must

Arithmetic teaching has suffered from false 
uses of teaching method. In this respect it has 
shared the common professional lot. But in 
addition it has had special difficulties and adven- 
tures of its own. We have now to note those

METHOD AS AFFECTED BY THE DISTRIBU- 
TION AND ARRANGEMENT OF ARITH- 
METICAL WORK 
The Tendency toward Shortening the Time 
Distribution 
SEVERAL decades ago arithmetic, as a formal 
subject, was begun in the first school year and 
continued throughout the grades to the last 
school year. This is no longer a characteristic 
condition, much less a uniform one. There have 
been forces operating to complete the subject of 
arithmetic prior to the eighth year, and to delay 
its first systematic presentation in the primary 
grades for a period varying from six months to 
two years. The report of the “Committee of 
Fifteen” of the National Education Association 
summarizes the tendency existing in 1895 when 
it states that, “with the right methods, and a 
wise use of time in preparing the arithmetic 
lesson in and out of school, five years are suffi-

cient for the study of mere arithmetic — the five 
years beginning with the second school year and 
ending with the close of the sixth year. 
The Attempt to Eliminate Waste 
The attempt to shorten the period of formal 
instruction in arithmetic has had its effects upon 
the methods of teaching as well as upon the ar- 
rangement of the course of study. The presence 
of a large number of children who leave school 
by the seventh year, the example of a varied 
European practice, the overcrowded curriculum, 
—all these have combined to suggest a short- 
ened treatment of arithmetic. Hence economy, 
through the elimination of obsolete and unim- 
portant topics in the course of study and through 
better methods of instruction, has become a 
pressing matter. Its influence on method is ob- 
vious. 
It has focused attention upon “teaching 
method” and given it an increasing importance 
in the eyes of mathematics teachers. Specifically, 
it has tended to reduce the amount of objective 
work, to eliminate the explanation or rationaliza-

-P-A-G-E-46
  TEACHING PRIMARY ARITHMETIC 
tion of processes which in life are done auto- 
matically; it has made teachers satisfied with 
teaching one manner of solution where, before, 
two or three were given ; it has laid the emphasis 
upon utilizing old knowledge in new places, rather 
than on acquiring new means. 
Delay in Beginning Formal Arithmetic 
Teaching 
(The tendency toward delay in beginning for- 
mal arithmetic instruction is to be explained in 
terms of several causes. Under a regimen where 
complicated and obsolete problems, difficult 
of comprehension, were common in elementary 
school tests, it was natural that teachers should 
believe that arithmetic is too difficult a subject 
for young children and that better results could 
be obtained if the subject weré not commenced 
till the children were more mature. 
This belief persists even after the curriculum 
is purged of all obsolete and A 
terials, and has become a modern course of 
study with materials well within the compre- 
hension and interest of primary Inibicens 
34 er-complex ma- 
 
-P-A-G-E-47
  DISTRIBUTION AND ARRANGEMENT 
The Incidental Method of Teaching 
The by-product of this belief is that any arith- 
metic taught during these first few years should 
be taught “incidentally,” as achance accompani- 
ment of other studies.’ Only after one or two 
years of incidental work should the formal arith- 
metic instruction be given. This “ incidental” 
method of teaching beginners is difficult to es- 
timate. It has been so variously treated that a 
comparative measure of its worth is difficult to 
obtain. The contention that children who are 
taught incidentally for two years and systemati- 
cally for two years more have at the end of 
four years of school life as good a command of 
arithmetic as those who have had a systematic 
course through four school years, is difficult 
to substantiate or deny on scientific grounds. 
Sometimes “incidental” teaching required by 
the course of study becomes “systematic” in 
the hands of the teacher. Sometimes the two 
years of “systematic” teaching which follow the 
incidental teaching mean far more than two 
years, since the teachers, in order to catch up, 
35 
 
-P-A-G-E-48
  TEACHING PRIMARY ARITHMETIC 
give more time and emphasis to the subject than 
the relative time-allotment of any general sched- 
ule would seem to warrant. Such have been the 
facts frequently revealed by a class-room inspec- 
tion that penetrates beyond the course of study, 
the time schedule, and regulations of the school 
board. 
Reactions against the Plan of Incidental Teaching 
In the lack of specific comparative measures of 
the worth of such methods of instruction, there 
is a growing conviction (1) that beginning school 
children are mature enough for the systematic 
study of all the arithmetic that the modern 
course of study would assign to these grades ; (2) 
that, considering the quantity and quality of their 
experiences, they can think or reason quite as 
well as memorize; and (3) that what the school re- 
quires of the child can be better done in a re- 
sponsible, systematic manner than by any hap- 
hazard system of “incidental” instruction. 
These reactionary attitudes by no means imply 
a return to “systematic” teaching of arithmetic 
in the first two school years, nor to such formal 
36
-P-A-G-E-49

methods as were previously employed. Other 
grounds forbid. The crude, uninteresting memori- 
ter methods of the past have gone for good. Ob- 
jective work, plays, games, manual activities make 
arithmetical study easier and more efficient. In- 
deed, these newer methods have been a large fac- 
tor in convincing teachers that children have the 
ability to master the first steps in arithmetic 
during the first two years. Regardless of this 
change in professional belief, it is a fairly general 
opinion that arithmetic should not be thrown 
upon the school-beginner along with the other 
heavy burden of learning to read. Learning the 
mechanics of reading is quite the most important 
part of the first school year, and the addition of 
the difficulties of another language —for such 
number is — would overburden and distract the 
child. Hence a common-sense distribution of 
burdens and tasks, regardless of questions of 
child maturity, would delay the formal and sys- 
tematic study of arithmetic a half or whole school 
year, little reliance being placed upon previous 
“incidental” acquisitions.

  Logical and Psychological Types of Arrangement 
There are other problems of method less con- 
cerned with the time for beginning the study, or 
with the span of school life to be given to it. 
These deal with the arrangement of sub-topics 
within the course of study, or with the manner 
of progression from one aspect of arithmetical 
experience to another. I refer now to the vari- 
ous methods of planning the work in arithmetic 
from grade to grade, of which the “Grube 
method” and the “ spiral” methods are types. 
The methods that have been employed in the 
United States for the arrangement or ordering 
of topics within the course of study have varied 
considerably from time to time, but all these 
variations may be grouped around two types: 
_» (1) The “logical” types of arrangement, and (2) 
{ the “psychological” types of arrangement. If 
the course of study proceeds primarily by units 
that are characteristic of the mathematics of a 
mature adult mind, the type may be said to be 
“logical.” If the ‘course of study proceeds pri- 
marily by units that are characteristic of the 
38
-P-A-G-E-51
  DISTRIBUTION AND ARRANGEMENT 
manner in which an immature child’s mind ap- 
proaches the subject, then the type may be said 
to be “psychological.” The dominant arrange- 
ments have been “logical” up to within the past 
two decades. The older text-books taught “ nota- 
tion and numeration” rather thoroughly, then pro- 
ceeded to a fairly adequate mastery of “addi- 
tion,” then to “subtraction,” and so on. Such 
an arrangement is distinctly “logical.” So also 
was the later “ Grube method,” which progressed 
by numbers rather than by processes. 
The courses of study which have been most 
familiar to us in the past decade have used the 
“concentric circle” or “spiral” methods of ar- 
ranging the sub-topics of arithmetic. These ar- 
rangements are “psychological” in type. They 
are attempts to give a systematic order of mas- 
tery which shall approximate the child’s order of 
need in knowing. Here the first mathematical 
facts and skills taught are those that the child 
first requires, regardless as to whether they em- 
ploy integers or fractions, additions or divisions, 
A little later, he deals with the same subjects 
and the same numbers in more complicated

manipulation and in more extended application, 
The field is re-covered, as it were, by ever widen- 
ing circles or by an enlarged swing of the “spiral” 
progression. 
Estimates of Worth 
The older “logical” plans are thorough and 
definite in their demands; the teacher always 
knows just what he is about. But such a system 
of procedure is unnatural and remote from the 
child ; it lacks appeal and motive. The child pur- 
sues the subject as a task laid down for him, not 
as an answer to his own curiosities or necessities. 
The newer psychological plans meet the different 
levels of child-maturity effectively; they are 
nearer the natural order of acquiring knowledge. 
The difficulty with all psychological arrange- 
ments is that the teacher cannot readily re- 
member what the child has and has not been. 
The supervisor, too, finds it hard to locate re- 
sponsibility for the teaching of definite arith- 
metic sub-topics. As orders of teaching they are 
psychologically natural but administratively in- 
effective.

-P-A-G-E-53
  
DISTRIBUTION AND ARRANGEMENT 
The Present Mixed Method of Procedure 
The result is that, to-day, the two types of 
arrangement are modifying each other and giv- 
ing a mixed method, partly “logical” and partly 
“psychological.” That line of least resistance in 
which the children study arithmetical facts and 
processes with greatest success is modified by 
definite demands that topics —e.g., addition 
be mastered thoroughly “then and there.” The 
method is partly “topical” and partly “spiral.” 
The child in the second grade may have a little 
of all the fundamental processes, a few simple 
fractions, and United States money; but just 
there he will be held definitely responsible for a 
very considerable number of the addition com 
binations. The pupil may have had fractions in 
every grade, but the fifth grade will be respon- 
sible for a thorough and systematic mastery of 
the same. Such is the mixed method of arrange- 
ment which is to-day prevalent in American 
schools.

THE DISTRIBUTION OF OBJECTIVE WORK 
Objective Teaching is Generally Current 
Tue use of objects in teaching arithmetic is cur- 
rent in the elementary school. Particularly is 
this true in the lowest grades of the school, in 
primary work. It may be said that there is a very 
large quantity of objective teaching in the first 
year of schooling and that it decreases more or 
less gradually as the higher grades are ap- 
proached. By the time the highest grammar 
grades are reached, the use of objects has reached 
its minimum, 
The teaching of arithmetic prior to the middle 
of the nineteenth century was little associated 
with object teaching. That is to say, the general 
practice of instruction was non-objective. The 
use of objects in giving a concrete basis for ab- 
stract arithmetical concepts and for memoriter 
manipulations, seems to have gained its initial

DISTRIBUTION OF OBJECTIVE WORK 
hold on the schools through the introduction of 
Pestalozzian methods of teaching. The later 
introduction of school subjects requiring objec- 
tive treatment, such as elementary science, na- 
ture study and manual training, fortified the 
previous movement and gave it considerable 
enlargement. Together these two movements 
established the respectability of objective teach- 
ing in arithmetic. School-room experience quickly 
gave it an empirical sanction. It remained for 
the modern psychological movement in educa- 
tion to give it a scientific sanction, and to refine 
‘its uses. 
Its Distribution is Crudely Gauged 
It is quite fair to say that the use of objective 
work decreases more or less gradually from the 
first to the last year, the underlying assumption 
being that the use of objects has a teaching 
value that decreases as the maturity of the pupils 
increases. Current practice does not proceed far 
beyond the application of the simple and some- 
what crude psychological statement that the 
youngest children must have much objective 
43  
-P-A-G-E-56
  TEACHING PRIMARY ARITHMETIC 
teaching, the older less, the oldest least of all. 
The lack of a more refined analysis of the worth 
of object teaching necessarily leads to some 
neglect and waste. 
If a new topic enters late into the course of 
study, as in the case of square root, the subject 
is not so well taught because of the current pre- 
judice or tradition against the use of object 
teaching in the higher grades. On the other 
hand it is also probable that the teaching of ad- 
dition is often accompanied by wasted time and 
energy simply because lingering over objects 
in the lower classes is the current fashion. 
Tendency toward a More Refined Correlation of 
Object Teaching with Particular Immaturity 
Reform in the direction of a more refined 
and exact use of object teaching has already 
appeared in the treatment of fractions and men- 
suration, where, regardless of the increased 
maturity of the children studying these topics, 
a large amount of objective method is utilized. 
This is a considerable departure from the slight 
objective treatment of other arithmetic topics 
44
-P-A-G-E-57
  DISTRIBUTION OF OBJECTIVE WORK 
taught in the same grades. Such exceptional 
practices suggest that the novelty of an arith- 
metic topic is the condition calling for objec- 
tive work in instruction. It is immaturity in 
a special subject or situation which determines 
the amount of basal objective work. The cor- 
relation is not with the age of the pupil, but 
with his experience with the social problem or 
subject in hand. It is of course true that the 
younger the student is, the greater the likelihood 
that any subject presented will be novel and 
strange. Only in this indirect manner does the 
novelty of subject matter coincide with mere 
youth as an essential principle in determining 
the need of objective presentation. The naive 
assumption of the older enthusiastic reformers 
that objective work is a good thing psycho- 
logically, one of which the pupil cannot have too 
much, is by no means the accepted view of the 
new reformer. With the latter,. objective pre- 
sentation is an excellent method at a given stage 
of immaturity in the special topic involved ; but 
it may be uneconomical, even an obstacle to 
efficiency, if pushed beyond, \

  TEACHING PRIMARY ARITHMETIC 
The Movement Supported by both Scientific and 
Common-Sense Criticism 
There is, then, a certain coincidence of the sci- 
entific criticism of the psychologist and of the 
common-sense criticism of the conservative 
teacher, who look suspiciously upon a highly ex- 
tended object teaching. The teacher, on grounds 
of experience, says that too much objective 
teaching is confusing and delays teaching. The 
psychological critic says it is unnecessary and 
wasteful. The result is that, in these later days, 
the distribution of objective work has changed 
somewhat. More subjects are developed in the 
higher grades through an objective instruction 
than before. Perhaps no fewer subjects in the 
lower grades are presented objectively, but the 
extent of objective treatment of each of these 
has undergone considerable curtailment.

THE MATERIALS OF OBJECTIVE TEACHING 
The Indiscriminate Use of Objects 
Tue existing defects in objective teaching are 
not restricted to a false placing or distribution. 
The quality of the teaching use of objects is 
likewise open to serious criticism. Object teach- 
ing is a device, so successful, as against prior 
non-objective teaching, that it has come to be a 
standard of instruction as well as a means. As 
long as objects — any convenient objects — are 
used, the teaching is regarded as good. Given 
such a sanction, the inevitable result is an un- 
discriminating use of objects. The process of 
objectifying tends not to be regulated by the 
needs of the child’s thinking life ; it is determined 
by the enthusiasm of the teacher and the ma- 
terials convenient for school use. 
The Artificiality of Materials Utilized 
The first fact which is noted in observing ob- 
jective teaching is the artificiality of the materials 
47
-P-A-G-E-60
  TEACHING PRIMARY ARITHMETIC 
employed. Primary children count, add, etc., with 
things they will never be concerned with in life. 
Lentils, sticks, tablets, and the like are the stock 
objective stuff of the schools, and to a consider- 
able degree this will always be the case. Cheap 
and convenient material suitable for individual 
manipulation on the top of a school desk is not 
plentiful. But instances where better and more 
normal material has been used are frequent 
enough in the best schools to warrant the belief 
that more could be done in this direction in the 
average classroom. The “playing at store,” the 
use of actual applications of the tables of weights 
and measures are cases that might be cited. 
Narrowness in the Range of Materials 
The materials used are not only more artificial 
than they need be, but too restricted in range. 
As has already been said, the types of material 
capable of convenient and efficient use in a 
schoolroom are not numerous. But the series 
can and ought to be extended. More forms of 
even the artificial material should be used, thus 
minimizing the danger of monotony. The blame 
48
-P-A-G-E-61
  
MATERIALS OF OBJECTIVE TEACHING 
for the narrow range of materials used falls partly 
on school boards who do not vote a sufficient 
allowance for teaching materials to primary 
teachers ; partly on teachers who do not exercise 
sufficient ingenuity in devising new forms of 
objects, or who do not show the vigor requisite 
to a shift from one material to another; and 
partly on the supervisory staff which has neither 
been insistent upon, nor sensitive to, the need 
of a more interesting range of objective stuffs. 
Inadequate Variation of Traditional Materials 
Even the narrow range of materials in general 
use might be better employed than it is. There 
is, of course, a distinct tendency to vary the ob- 
jects, merely because a child gets tired of one 
kind as a material. But a different quality of 
variation is required when the pupil is to derive 
abstract notions from concrete materials. It is 
too frequently the case that the teacher will 
treat the fundamental addition combinations with 
one set of objects, ¢.g., lentils. In all the child’s 
objective experience within that field there are 
two persistent associations — “ lentils” and “the 
49
-P-A-G-E-62
  TEACHING PRIMARY ARITHMETIC 
relation of addition.” The accidental element is 
thus emphasized as frequently as the essential 
one and, being concrete, has even a better chance 
toimpress itself. A wide variation in the objective 
material used would make teaching more effective, 
particularly with young children. 
The Restricted Use of Diagrams and Pictures 
The nature of the materials proper to objective, 
teaching has likewise been too narrowly inter- 
preted. Objective teaching has meant, almost 
exclusively, instructing or developing through 
three-dimensional presentations. There is a wide 
range of two-dimensional representations which 
have been neglected, but which for all the psy- 
chological purposes of education have as much 
worth as so-called objects. I refer here to the 
use of such material as pictures. Such quasi-ob- 
jective material has been little used by teachers 
save as it appears in textbooks. Even the text- 
book writers have not used pictures with a deep 
sense of their intrinsic worth. They are printed 
as a mere substitute for objects in a period when 
objects are popular pedagogical materials. The 
50
-P-A-G-E-63
  MATERIALS OF OBJECTIVE TEACHING 
geometric figure or diagram has had a slight use 
with both the teacher and the textbook writer. 
Its most frequent use has been in treatments of 
mensuration. There are, of course, obvious dis- 
advantages to pictures and diagrams. The things 
represented in them are not capable of personal 
manipulation by the child in the ordinary sense. 
But they have a superiority all their own. They 
offer a wider, more natural, and more interesting 
range of concrete experiences. 
Plays and Games in Olject Teaching 
There are other curious phases of narrowness 
in the current pedagogical interpretation of what 
constitutes a concrete or objective experience. 
It will be noted that visual objects are the ones 
generally employed and that they are generally 
inanimate objects. Of late there has been some 
tendency to use hearing and touch in giving a 
concrete basis to teaching. Advantage is taken 
of the social plays of children, and their games 
with things. Here the children themselves, and 
their relations and acts are the experiences from 
which the numerical units are obtained. With

some of the best teachers in the lowest grades 
it is no longer unusual to see children moving 
about in all sorts of play designed to add reality 
to, and increase interest in, number facts. 
The Lack of Unity in the Use of Objects 
The conservative teacher’s use of objects is 
hopelessly artificial and lacking in unity.;If he 
brings a series of objects into the development 
of a single topic, they have little relation to each 
other, and they represent no actual grouping. 
Their sole connection with one another is that 
they exemplify the same abstract arithmetical 
truth. Beans, cardboard squares, and shoe-pegs 
may all be employed in the same lesson. The 
progressive teachers offer more logical unity in 
their materials. To “play at store,” to utilize 
games, to deal with things within a picture, is to 
bring the concrete materials into the classroom 
with a more nearly normal setting. It is in no 
small measure due to this better use of material 
that the progressive teacher is gaining power 
throughout the elementary grades,

VII 
SOME RECENT INFLUENCES ON OBJECTIVE 
TEACHING 
Tue wasteful use of objective teaching in the 
lowest grades has undergone some correction. 
The sheer enthusiasm of the modern reformer is 
partly responsible for this modification of con- 
servative practice. When did single-minded men 
ever keep within bounds? In our social economy 
the defense of the radical is found in the fact 
that other single-minded men are conservatives. 
Men at one extreme need to be overcome by like 
men at the other. But the check of one enthu- 
siast on another is not always perfect. Other 
contributory causes make it easy to go to unfor- 
tunate extremes not easily corrected. 
The Influence of Inductive Teaching 
Inductive teaching has been one of several 
movements affecting objective teaching. The 
effort of teachers to escape the slavishness of 
53 
 
-P-A-G-E-66
  | | 
TEACHING PRIMARY | eae: 
mere memoriter methods and to approximate 
real thinking led to the introduction of inductive 
teaching. Necessarily objective teaching became 
more or less identified with the new movement 
and was influenced by it. So, it has been said 
of objective work in arithmetic as it has been 
said of laboratory work in the sciences, that 
such instruction is a method of “discovery” or 
“rediscovery.” Such an alliance has had its ben- 
eficial effects upon objective teaching ; it has re- 
deemed it from the aimless “observational work” 
of an earlier “objective study.” But in the teach- 
ing of arithmetic, at any rate, it has confused an 
objective mode of presentation with a scientific 
method of learning truth, two activities having 
a common logical basis, but not at all the same. 
Under the assumption that the “development” 
method is one of “rediscovery,” the tendency is 
to give the child as complete a range of con- 
crete evidences as would be necessary on the 
part of the scientist in substantiating a new fact. 
The result is, that long after the child is con- 
vinced of the truth, say that 4 and 2 are 6, the 
teacher persists in giving further objective illus- 
54
-P-A-G-E-67
  INFLUENCES ON OBJECTIVE TEACHING 
trations of the fact. The child loses interest in 
the somewhat monotonous continuance of ob- 
jective manipulations, and the teacher has natu- 
rally wasted time and energy. If the fact or the 
process that the teacher wishes to convey can 
be transmitted with fewer objective treatments 
(the authoritative treatment of the teacher count- 
ing for something in school, as authority counts 
everywhere), then it is unnecessary to exhaust 
the objective treatments of a numerical fact. In- 
ductive teaching and learning are not equivalent 
to inductive discovery; and to hold them iden- 
tical is necessarily to overdo the use of objects in 
teaching. 
The Movement for Active Modes of Learning 
Another modern movement in teaching method 
which has had a conspicuous effect on objective - 
teaching is the Froebelian demand for “ self-ac- 
tivity” on the part of the child. The recent favor 
enjoyed by manual training, nature study, self- 
government, and other active phases of school 
life is indicative of the sway of this doctrine. Its 
influence has forced the introduction of new sub- 
55 
 
-P-A-G-E-68
  TEACHING PRIMARY ARITHMETIC 
jects and changed the manner of presenting the 
older subjects of the elementary curriculum. 
Arithmetic has responded along with the other 
studies, and an active use of objects by the chil- 
dren themselves is found in increased degree. 
There was a time when objective work in the 
schools was a passive matter so far as the child 
was concerned. Any active manipulation of the 
objects that might be required was cared for by 
the teacher, the child being merely a passive 
observer. This is much less the case than for- 
merly, the influence of “self-activity” having 
entered with contemporaneous pedagogy. The 
present ‘situation is one where the child some- 
times merely observes objects and sometimes 
actually handles them. 
At present, then, we have about the same 
range of methods employed in teaching arith- 
metic as in teaching science. At one extreme 
the teacher himself demonstrates by the help of 
objects in the presence of the class, and records 
the relations in appropriate arithmetical symbols, 
the class being in the position of interested spec- 
tators of a process, At the other extreme the 
56 
 
-P-A-G-E-69
  
INFLUENCES ON OBJECTIVE TEACHING 
teacher puts the material on the desks of the 
children and, with a minimum of instruction in 
advance, directs them toward the desired expe- 
riences and conclusions. 
The Abbreviated Use of Objects 
As might be expected, there has been some 
reaction against the influences emerging from 
inductive or developmental teaching and active 
modes of learning. To a considerable degree the 
reactionary influence expresses itself in the ab- 
breviated use of objects in presenting a mathe- 
matical relation, process, or manipulation. One 
mode of abbreviation will suffice as an example. 
There are two methods of relating the sym- 
bols and processes of arithmetic to the actual 
relations among objects. For convenience these 
may bé called the methods of “parallel corre- 
spondence” and of “final correspondence.” 
The Method of Parallel Correspondence 
The method of “parallel correspondence” is 
generally used in the development of all the 
simpler combinations or processes of arithmetic. 
57
-P-A-G-E-70
  TEACHING PRIMARY ARITHMETIC 
In learning to count, the child sees the first ob- 
ject and says the symbolic “ one,” sees the sec- 
ond object, and says the symbolic “two.” Again 
in addition, he sees “ten,” and writes the sym- 
bol 10; sees “‘six,’”’ and writes 6 ; sees the whole 
as sixteen, and writes 16; then summarizes the 
work in the form 10+6=16. Each stage in the 
symbolic process is noted in connection with ob- 
jects. This, the method of “ parallel correspond- 
ence,” is the more current method of using 
objects. 
The Method of Final Correspondence 
The method of showing a “final correspond- 
ence” of result between objective manipulation 
and symbolic manipulation is much less fre- 
quently used, It is used with more complex pro- 
cesses than those mentioned above, in connec- 
tion with column addition or “borrowing” in 
subtraction. It is a mode of object teaching used 
in place of the usual “explanation” or “ration- 
alization” which attempts to explain what is sim- 
ply a correspondence between the manipulation 
of a series of facts and the manipulation of a se- 
58 
 
-P-A-G-E-71
  
INFLUENCES ON OBJECTIVE TEACHING 
ries of symbols. Under this method the teacher 
usually tells the child directly how to perform 
the process in the conventional manner, no spe- 
cial explanation being given. Then a case in- 
volving the actual use of objects is considered, 
and this result is compared with the result ob- 
tained by the symbolic manipulation, One or 
two such cases suffice to convince the pupil that 
the authoritative mode is true to nature. This 
method of “final correspondence” in the use of 
objects represents a new and restricted, but in- 
creasing, tendency.

THE USE OF METHODS OF RATIONALIZATION 
The Tendency toward Rational Methods 
Some of the marked changes which have occurred 
in the methods employed for the presentation of 
number to children have already been mentioned 
in connection with the objective teaching of 
arithmetic. (he main tendency to be noted is 
that objective instruction, which has been used 
as a mere device of illustration, becomes the 
first step in inductive or developmental teaching. 
It is subsumed under a more inclusive method. 
The change is significant, for it is a symp- 
tom indicating that mathematical teaching is 
becoming less dominantly memoriter and more 
rational. 
The Eva of Direct Instruction and Drill 
Several decades ago it was not at all unusual 
for the bare facts of arithmetic to be given to 
the child by the teacher without much attempt at 
60 
 
-P-A-G-E-73
  METHODS OF RATIONALIZATION 
providing a basis in the pupil’s own experience. 
The teaching was “direct,” the teacher’s atten- 
tion being focused on getting the fact from his 
own mind into the child’s mind, the whole em- 
phasis being placed upon the problem of trans- 
mission and the subsequent difficulty of retention. 
In so far as objects and illustrations were used, 
they were merely incidental and reinforcive. They 
did not constitute any basic body of personal ex- 
perience by which the child was to seize a con- 
cept, relation, or process to be handled thereafter 
through symbols and conventional forms. Under 
such a system of instruction, still too widely prev- 
alent, the child had to memorize outright, with- 
out any concrete basis for his belief, tables of 
addition, multiplication, etc., and the rules for 
solving various types of problems. It was outright 
memorization for which little vital motivation 
was provided. In insuring retention the teacher 
therefore relied, not upon interested and varied 
impressions, but upon the number of verbal re- 
petitions. “Drill” was characteristic of this era 
in teaching. 
61
-P-A-G-E-74
TEACHING PRIMARY ARITHMETIC 
Indirect Teaching as a Rational Method 
Under the influence of the inductive or de- 
velopmental method of teaching, the emphasis 
on the repetitional memorization of number facts 
and processes is reduced. Teaching now becomes 
“indirect” rather than “direct” ; the child learns 
through his own experience rather than through 
the statement of book or teacher. Here the child’s 
own thought and activity, not the teacher’s, are 
conspicuously central in the teaching situation. 
The teacher stimulates the child into action ; he 
suggests, guides, corrects, does everything in fact 
save obtrude his authority and opinion into the 
child’s interpretation. The child’s activity gives 
him many vivid and varied impressions of the sub- 
traction combination or other relation. When he 
has found the fact, he has already learned it! 
Further drill or review is not primary, but simply 
supplementary —a further guarantee of the per- 
sistence of the impression. Even the spirit of 
such supplementary drill and review is, in these 
days, something different from a monotonous re- 
petition of the same words ; it is a reimpression 
62 
 
-P-A-G-E-75
METHODS OF RATIONALIZATION 
or review of the essential fact in many varied and 
interesting forms. 
Interest as a Factor in Methods of Rational- 
tization 
It is perfectly natural that, in shifting the 
teacher’s attention from his own activities to those 
of the children, the interest of the child should 
be considered in increasing degree. If the child 
is to learn directly, with a maximum use of his 
initiative, it is absolutely essential that the 
teacher should provide some motive. This im- 
plies that the child is to be interested in some 
fundamental way in the activities in which he is 
toengage. Instead of thumbing the fundamental 
facts with his memory, in an artificial and effort- 
ful manner, “ sing-songing ” the tables rhythmi- 
cally, so as to make dull business less dull, the 
child studies the arithmetic involved in his own 
life, for the modern teacher brings the two to- 
gether. The number story, the arithmetical game, 
playing at adult activities, constructive work, | 
measuring, and other vital interests of the child | 
and community life become increasingly the basis | 
63 ¥

of instruction in number. Such is the pronounced 
tendency wherever the movement is away from 
the traditional rote-learning or drill. 
Of course there is a slight tendency in Amer- 
ican elementary schools, where a soft and false 
interpretation of the “doctrine of interest” is 
gospel, to teach only those things that can be 
taught in an interesting fashion. But this tend- 
ency is less operative in arithmetic than in 
other subjects. Here the logical interdependence 
of one arithmetical skill on another has quickly 
pointed the failure of such a haphazard mode of 
instruction. 
The Reaction against Rationalization 
There is, however, in “advanced” as well as 
in reactionary quarters, a revolt against the tend- 
ency to objectify, explain, or rationalize every- 
thing taught in arithmetic. On the whole it is a 
discriminating movement, for this opposition to 
“rationalization” in arithmetical teaching, and 
in favor of “memorization” or “ habituation,” 
bases its plea on rational grounds, mainly derived 
from the facts of modern psychology. 
64 
 
-P-A-G-E-77
  
METHODS OF RATIONALIZATION 
It is specifically opposed to explaining why 
“carrying” in addition, and “ borrowing” in sub- 
traction are right modes of procedure. These 
acts are to be taught as memory or habit, inas- 
much as they are to be performed by that method 
forever after. To develop such processes ration- 
\ally or to demand a reason for the procedure once 
it is acquired, is merely to stir up unnecessary 
trouble, trouble unprompted by any demands of 
actual efficiency. 
Four Principles for the Use of Rationalization 
A study of the actual arithmetical facts upon 
which this opposition expresses itself suggests 
the four following general principles as to the 
use of “rationalization” and “habituation,” as 
methods of mastery: (1) Any fact or process 
which always recurs in an identical manner, and 
occurs with sufficient frequency to be remem- 
bered, ought not to be “rationalized” for the 
pupil, but “habituated.” The correct placing 
of partial products in the multiplication of two 
numbers of two or more figures is a specific case. 
(2) If a process does recur in the same manner, 
65  
-P-A-G-E-78
TEACHING PRIMARY ARITHMETIC 
  but is so little used in after life that any formal 
method of solution would be forgotten, then the 
teacher should “rationalize” it. The process of 
finding the square root of a number illustrates 
this series of facts. (3) If the process always does 
occur in the same manner, but with the frequency 
of its recurrence in doubt, the teacher should 
both “habituate” and “ rationalize.” The division 
of a fraction by a fraction is frequently taught 
both “mechanically” and “ by thinking it out.” 
(4) When a process or relation is likely to be ex- 
pressed in a variable form, then the child must 
be taught to think through the relations involved, 
and should not be permitted to treat it mechan- 
ically, through a mere act of habit or memory. 
All applied examples are to be dealt with in this 
manner, for such problems are of many types, 
and no two problems of the same type are ever 
quite alike. These laws will, of course, not be 
interpreted to mean that no reason is to be given 
a child in a process like “carrying ” in addition, 
The reason is not essential to efficient mastery, 
but it may be given to add interest or to satisfy 
the specially curious. 
66
-P-A-G-E-79
  METHODS OF RATIONALIZATION 
The Substantiating Psychology 
The theoretic basis which seems to underlie 
such a statement of general principles is derived 
from functional psychology. Memory and reason- 
ing are not separate functions ; they are interde- 
pendent ; but we mean differently by these terms 
because they have distinguishable emphases. It 
may be said that memory as a function is effi- 
cient only in the face of familiar situations 
where, if the association is present at all, the 
response is quick and precise. In the face of 
new situations it is incapable of accurate re- 
sponse. Reason is slow and uneconomical in 
action, but it is the only efficient method of 
arriving at the essential nature of a problem 
largely unfamiliar. It would be wasteful to meet 
many of the necessary events of life with a 
purely reasoned reaction. It would be too de- 
vious and deliberate in reaching conclusions. 
Rationalization as a Substitute for Object 
Teaching 
There is a sense in which all proof through 
objects is a type of rationalization, but we do 
67
-P-A-G-E-80
TEACHING PRIMARY ARITHMETIC 
not ordinarily so consider it. Such a mere “cor- 
respondence with the objective facts” is suffi- 
ciently different from the method of “ explaining 
a new fact in terms of previously acquired facts” 
to warrant a separate classification. Were it 
not that the methods are sometimes inter- 
changeable in developing arithmetical truths, 
they would not need to be mentioned here. A 
citation will make the point clear. be teaching 
the multiplication tables, the combination “ six 
twos are twelve” may be taught as a direct ob- 
jective fact, as when six pupils with two hands 
each are shown. On the other hand the same 
fact of multiplication may be taught as a “de- 
rived fact,” as when six twos are added in a 
column and make twelve. They are both rational 
methods of proving that six twos are twelve. 
One method shows it objectively, the other 
through the use of well established addition 
combinations viewed as multiplication. Such a 
rational mode of “deriving” multiplication is 
used more frequently perhaps than the objective 
method.

SPECIAL METHODS FOR OBTAINING ACCU- 
RACY, INDEPENDENCE, AND SPEED 
Supervision of Learning after First Development 
Ir is not alone the first stages in the acquisition 
of an arithmetical process which have received 
attention in the re-organization of teaching 
methods, though, to be sure, the problem of 
first presentations has in recent decades been 
given the most attention. More and more, the 
American tendency is to watch every step in 
the learning process, to provide for all necessary 
transitions, and to safeguard against avoidable 
confusions. It might be suggested that the in- 
termediation of the teacher at every step in the 
child’s work might destroy the pupil’s initiative 
and independence. Apparently, however, those 
who are deeply interested that the child should 
not be permitted to fall into the errors which 
unsupervised drill would convert into habits, are 
fully as cautious to provide steps for forcing the 
69
-P-A-G-E-82
TEACHING PRIMARY ARITHMETIC 
child to assume an increasing responsibility for 
his own work. The distinction made is that an 
over-early independence is as fatal to accurate 
and rapid mathematical work as an over-delayed 
dependence. 
The Use of Steps, or Stages, in Teaching 
Some of these serial treatments or related 
stages of method to which reference has been 
made may be cited. Necessarily only the more 
important are mentioned. In indicating certain 
clean-cut steps or processes, there is no intent to 
convey the idea that these stages are fixed or 
conscious matters. The statement is merely in- 
dicative of the habitual tendency of the average 
practitioner with an implied theory. As will be 
readily evident, there is no assumption that such 
a formal, classified, theoretic statement of stages 
is a conscious possession of the teaching staff in 
general. Again, in actual school work there are 
many types of variation from the characteristic 
modes here suggested. Always the steps overlap; 
frequently they are extended, abbreviated, or 
omitted. But the statement represents, in a very 
7° ‘ 
 
-P-A-G-E-83
  SPECIAL METHODS 
real way, the trend of underlying theory, whether 
conscious or merely implied. 
Stages in the Presentation of Problems 
One of the specific controversies much argued 
in the primary school concerns the medium 
through which arithmetical examples and prob- 
lems shall be transmitted to young children. 
There are three typical ways in which a-situa- 
tion demanding arithmetical solution may be 
brought to the child’s mind: (1) The situation 
when visible may be presented through itself, 
that is, objectively. (2) The situation may be 
described through the medium of spoken lan- 
guage, the teacher usually giving the dictation. 
(3) The situation may be conveyed through 
written language, as when the child: reads from 
blackboard or text. Inasmuch as objects are a: 
universal language, no difficulty arises through 
this basic method of presentation. It is when a 
language description of a situation is substituted 
for the situation itself that difficulty occurs. The 
child might be able to solve the problem if he 
really understood the situation the language was 
71 
 
-P-A-G-E-84
  TEACHING PRIMARY ARITHMETIC 
meant to convey. Owing to the difficulty that 
primary children have in getting the thought out 
of language, it has been urged that problems 
in any unfamiliar field should be presented in 
the following order: (1) Objectively or graphi- 
cally ; (2) when the fundamental idea is grasped, 
through spoken language ; and (3), after the type 
of situation is fairly familiar, through written or 
printed language. It is seriously urged by some 
teachers that no written presentation should be 
used in the first four grades. Such an extreme 
tendency would practically abolish the use of 
primary text-books. There are many exceptional 
teachers who do not put a primary text in the 
hands of children at all. Such a tendency is in- 
creasing. Particularly is this true among primary 
teachers in the schools of the foreign quarters of 
large cities. Accurate communication through 
the English language is always more difficult here. 
Hence, the period of objective teaching is neces- 
sarily prolonged, dependence on the “number 
stories” told by the teacher extended, and the 
solution of written problems much longer de- 
layed than elsewhere. 
72 
 
-P-A-G-E-85
    
SPECIAL METHODS 
An Opposite Method in Presenting Examples 
The situation is somewhat different, almost 
the opposite in fact, when “ examples” rather 
than “problems” are presented, meaning by “ex- 
ample” a “problem” expressed through the use 
of mathematical signs. It is easier to present 
“examples ” in written form on blackboard or in 
text than it is to dictate them orally. This ob- 
viates the necessity of holding the examples in 
mind during solution, The permanence of the 
visual presentation saves the re-statement fre- 
quently necessary in oral presentation. Hence it 
is a common practice to supply the youngest chil- 
dren with mimeographed or written sheets of “ex- 
amples.” It is with olderchildren, or with younger 
children at a later stage in the mastery of a typical 
difficulty, that oral presentation of examples is 
stressed. Then we have that type of work which 
is called “mental” or “silent” arithmetic. 
Better Transitions from Concrete to Abstract 
Work 
There is some tendency toward the provision 
of better transitions from the objective presenta- 
73 
 
-P-A-G-E-86
  TEACHING PRIMARY ARITHMETIC 
tion of applied’ problems to the symbolic pre- 
sentation of abstract examples. Behind all uses 
of objective work is the belief that it is a mere 
foundation for more rapid and efficient abstract 
work. Objective teaching is fundamental, but 
purely preparatory. The child ought to pass 
from objects and sense-impressions, through 
images of various degrees of abbreviation, to 
symbols and the abstract concepts for which 
they stand. But in American practice a sharp 
jump is usually made from concrete objects to 
abstract symbols, The transition through ade- 
quate transitional imagery is not made. Wher- 
ever psychological influences are directly at work 
in the schools, there is a minority movement 
favoring a better transition. The nature of such 
transition is scarcely reasoned out as so much 
psychological science, but is the accompaniment 
of a widening professional movement for the 
enlarged use of pictures, diagrams, number 
stories, and the like. A critical examination of 
the various means of presenting arithmetical 
situations would order them as follows in making 
the transitions from objective concreteness to 
74

  SPECIAL METHODS 
symbolic abstraction: (1) Objects, (2) pictures, 
(3) graphs, (4) the concrete imagery of words, 
(5) more abstract verbal presentations, (6) pre- 
sentations through mathematical symbols. No 
such minuteness of adjustment is apparent in 
existing methods, though it might seem desir- 
able in teaching young children. At any rate, it 
would be more effective than an unreasoned tra- 
ditional procedure full of over-emphasis and 
omission. 
The Child’s Four Modes of Work 
We have thus far discussed merely the teach- 
er’s activity in instruction. We have to note the 
graded requirement made in the child’s own ac- 
tivity. What is the existing custom with refer- 
ence to the manner in which children are required 
tosolve the problems or examples presented to 
them? There are four typical ways in which the 
child does his work, the names of which are de- 
rived from the differentiating element: (1) The 
“silent” method, otherwise spoken of as “ mental 
arithmetic,” “arithmetic without a pencil,” etc. 
(2) The “oral”’ method where the child works 
75
-P-A-G-E-88
TEACHING PRIMARY ARITHMETIC 
aloud, that is, expresses his procedure step by 
step in speech, (3) The “ written” method where 
the child writes out in full his analysis and cal- 
culation. (4) The “mixed” method where the 
child uses all three of the previously mentioned 
methods, in alternation, as ease and efficiency 
may require. 
The Worth of these Modes 
The worth of these four methods of work is 
necessarily variable. The rapidity of the “silent 
method” with simple figures is obvious. The 
“silent method” and the “mixed method” (which 
is more slow but more manageable with complex 
processes and calculations) are the two methods 
normally employed in social and business life. 
The purely “oral” and “written” methods, with 
their tendency toward analysis and calculation 
fully expressed in oral or written language, are 
highly artificial. They are valuable as school 
devices for revealing the action of the child’s 
mind to the teacher so that it may be corrected, 
guided, and generally controlled. The present 
tendency is toward an over-use of these methods 
76
-P-A-G-E-89
  
SPECIAL METHODS 
and toward an under-use of the other two, more 
particularly the “mixed” method. It would seem 
- that there is little conscious attempt to make 
certain that the child moves from full oral or 
written statement to the judicious application of 
the more natural “ silent” and “ mixed” methods. 
It may be that full oral and written statements 
of work have seriously hampered the right use of 
the more natural methods of statement. 
The Traditional Quarrel between “ Mental” and 
“Written” Arithmetic 
One conspicuous traditional quarrel in the 
schools is between the “silent” and the “ writ- 
ten” methods. Up to within a decade or so ago, 
“silent” or “mental” arithmetic was much over- 
emphasized, being carried to absurd extremes. 
The reaction that followed was equally extreme 
in its emphasis on the “ written” method. There 
are signs now of a more rational use of the two 
as supplements of each other. 
The order in which different statements of 
arithmetical work should come has also been a 
subject for pedagogical argument. The usual 
77 
 
-P-A-G-E-90
  TEACHING PRIMARY ARITHMETIC 
order, due to the fact that first treatments of a 
topic are simple both in the steps of reasoning 
and the calculations involved, has been “silent” 
arithmetic followed by “written” arithmetic. A 
more recent order has been: (1) “silent” (2) 
“written” (3) “silent? — a much superior serial 
order, though by no means an accurate state- 
ment of a perfect procedure. The fixed treat- 
ments necessitated by text-books have made 
teaching method arbitrary in its steps, here as 
elsewhere. It is altogether probable that many 
simple calculations or analyses can be done 
“silently ” (“mentally”) from the beginning; 
that others require visual demonstration, but once 
mastered can thereafter be done without visual 
aids; that still others will always have to be per- 
formed, partially at least, with some written work. 
It is purely a matter for concrete judgment 
in each special case, but the existing practice 
scarcely recognizes this truth. The result is that 
many problems are arbitrarily done in one way, 
and it is too frequently the uneconomical and in- 
efficient way that is used.

SPECIAL METHODS 
The Transition from Development by Teacher to 
Independent Work by Pupil 
It is well to recall that in all these efforts to 
control the child’s activity, there is a tendency 
to leave the child over-dependent upon the 
teacher. It is vitally important that a child 
should be kept free of any error which unsuper- 
vised drill would fix into a stubborn habit; but 
it is likewise important that the child should 
acquire some self-reliance. While not always 
clearly defined, there is a distinct tendency in 
the direction of releasing the teacher's control 
of the child. A characteristic practice would be 
one in which the teacher's work with the child 
would pass through various stages, each one of 
which would mark a decrease in the control of 
the process by the teacher and an increase in 
the freedom of the child to do his example, or 
problem, by himself. 
Four Characteristic Stages of the Transition 
One characteristic series of stages quite fre- 
quently used in the presentation of a single topic 
79  
-P-A-G-E-92
  TEACHING PRIMARY ARITHMETIC 
in arithmetic, say “carrying” in addition, is the 
following: (1) The teacher performs the pro- 
cess on the blackboard in the presence of the 
class, the children not being allowed to attempt 
the process by themselves until after the process 
is clearly understood from the teacher’s develop- 
ment. (2) The children are then allowed to per- 
form the process upon the blackboard, where it 
is exceedingly easy for the teacher to keep the 
work of every child under his eye. An error is 
caught by a quick glance at the board and im- 
mediately corrected before the child can reiterate 
a false impression. (3) Other cases of the same 
type of example are assigned to the children at 
their seats where they work upon paper, still 
under the supervision of the teacher —a super- 
vision which is less adequate, however. (4) The 
same difficulty, after the careful safeguarding of 
the previous stages, is then assigned for “ home 
work,” where the child relies almost completely 
upon himself. Once more it is necessary to sug- 
gest that these stages are merely roughly im- 
plied in the variations of existing practice.

yw SPECIAL METHODS 
Special Methods of Attaining Speed 
Most of the methods discussed in this chapter 
have had as their sanction the attainment of ac- 
curacy in thinking and calculating. Some efforts 
to insure independent power on the part of the 
child have already been noted. But nothing has 
been said of the effort to add speed to accuracy 
in getting efficient results. Such special efforts 
have been made. These efforts may be classified 
into two groups: (1) Those aiming to quicken 
the rate of mental response. (2) Those aiming at 
short-cut processes of calculation. 
Typical of the first are (2) the use of an es- 
tablished rhythm as the child attacks a column 
of additions; (4) the device of having children 
race for quick answers, letting them raise their 
hands or stand when they have gotten the an- 
swer ; (c) the assignment of a series of problems 
for written work under the pressure of a restricted 
time allotment for the performance of each. 
These and similar devices are much used in the 
schools. They are open to the objection that they 
quicken the rate of the better students, but foster 
81
-P-A-G-E-94
  TEACHING PRIMARY ARITHMETIC 
confusion, error, and discouragement among the : 
less able children, thus actually hindering speed. 
The various shorter methods which represent 
an effort to reduce the number of mental pro- 
cesses required are usually not of general appli- 
cability, and consequently have not attained gen- 
eral currency in the elementary schools which aim 
to teach merely one generally available and ef- 
fective method even though it requires more 
time, special expertness being left to later de- 
velopment in the special school or business which 
requires it. 
The Relation of Accuracy to Speed 
It has come to be quite a common opinion 
among teachers that the fundamental element in 
rapid arithmetical work is certain and accurate 
calculation. If pupils know their tables of com- 
binations and are sure of each detail of calcula- 
tion, there is no confusion or hesitancy ; speed 
then follows as a matter of course. This belief, 
as much as anything else, explains why the lower 
schools have developed few special means for at- 
taining speed other than those mentioned.

THE USE OF SPECIAL ALGORISMS, ORAL 
FORMS, AND WRITTEN ARRANGEMENTS 
Tue methods of teaching arithmetic are influ- 
enced not only by the aims of such instruction, 
but by the peculiar nature of the matter taught. 
The use of special algorisms, temporary algor- 
istic aids or teaching “ crutches,” oral and written 
forms of analysis, are of considerable moment 
in determining the difficulties and therefore the 
methods of teaching. Their condition and influ- 
ence will need to be given some slight notice. 
The Traditional Nature of Algorisms and Forms 
The algorisms and forms used in the American 
schools are those that have been determined by 
social and educational traditions. It is probable 
that wide social practice has largely determined 
the traditions, though it must be admitted that 
the traditions of text-book makers have also 
given it form. In consequence the ruling school 
83
-P-A-G-E-96
TEACHING PRIMARY ARITHMETIC 
tradition in the matter of algorisms does not al- 
ways coincide with current community practice. 
It is probable that the various modes of comput- 
ing interest, given by the average arithmetic of 
ten years ago, were once current in the business 
world. These methods have changed somewhat, 
and the school form of computation has not al- 
ways been changed to accord, Such misadjust- 
ments between the forms used in school and 
those used in daily life are not numerous, but 
they are more frequent than they ought to be. 
  The Number of Algorisms Used 
The use of various algorisms for a single pro- 
cess is not very frequent. There is a fairly gen- 
eral prevalence of a single algorism for a single 
process among American teachers, Certain strik- 
ing exceptions are to be noted in connection with 
subtraction and division, where the so-called 
« Austrian” methods are being brought into 
competition with the traditional modes of the 
American school. It may be said, however, that 
even when two distinct algorisms are in contem- 
poraneous use in a schol system, the teachers 
84
-P-A-G-E-97
  
USE OF SPECIAL FORMS 
-are usually careful to employ only one algorism 
with a given child. Even whena child moves from 
a school using one kind of algorism to a school 
using another, the tendency is to allow him to 
follow his own method. 
Reform in the Use of Algorisms 
The tendency toward the substitution, dupli- 
cation, and modification of existing algorisms is 
inconsiderable, and very recent. The introduction 
of the “ Austrian” algorisms, already mentioned, 
is perhaps the most conspicuous movement, hav- 
ing a very wide group of adherents. There are, 
however, a group of teachers and educational 
psychologists who are attempting to refine teach- 
ing methods so as to attain a greater economy 
and efficiency in the learning process. These are 
responsible for a movement toward the reform 
of existing algorisms. The movement expresses 
itself in a number of ways, — it offers new forms, 
modifies others, and aims to bring a larger sim- 
ilarity and consistency into algorisms employed 
in the various stages of the same process. Its 
function is always to simplify for the child and 
85
-P-A-G-E-98
  TEACHING PRIMARY ARITHMETIC 
j 
thus to increase the practical efficiency and the 
mental economy of his methods. 
The Standard of Social Usage 
One of the standards set, is, that as far as is 
consistent with economy, the algorism employed 
with greatest frequency in social life is to be 
preferred. If people add, subtract, and multiply 
with their figures arranged above and below each 
other in vertical form 5, then the vertical form 
is to be preferred to the horizontal method 
6+3=9 so largely used and imposed by text- , 
book writers. 
The Extended Use of Acquired Forms 
To learn two forms for one thing, particularly 
when one has no sanction either in current use 
or on general grounds of psychological efficiency, 
is a waste. Hence there is an increasing disposi- 
tion both in general practice and among the 
more critical to utilize a single form in as many 
places as possible. “Subtracting by adding” is 
merely using the same association and word form 
for both addition and subtraction. Hence only 
86
-P-A-G-E-99
  
USE OF SPECIAL FORMS 
one set of tables, instead of two, has to be learned. 
The meaning, the applicability, and the visual 
form of addition and subtraction are still different. 
Only the process of remembering and using the 
fundamental combinations is the same. But this 
is a large saving: “ Dividing by multiplying ” is 
an analogous situation, though not so much em- 
ployed in American schools as “subtracting by 
adding.” The most radical suggestion for utilizing 
a simplified common form is one in which these 
forms of division, as used in the tables 18+6=3, 
in short division 6)1832, and in long division 
62)18325(, are reduced to one consistent form 
in all three cases, as 6[18, 6[1832, 62[18325. 
Such a simplification is urged in other situations. 
The movement has not passed far beyond theo- 
retic acceptance, though several city school sys- 
tems are trying the experiment, San Francisco 
being a notable instance, 
The Use of “ Crutches” or Temporary Algorisms 
The use of special and temporary algoristic 
aids or learning “crutches” in mathematical cal- 
culation is one of the problems of method under 
87 
 
-P-A-G-E-100
  TEACHING PRIMARY ARITHMETIC 
constant controversy. Teachers seem fairly evenly 
divided upon the question. Typical situations in 
which such “crutches” are used may be noted 
as follows: Changing the figures of the upper 
number in “borrowing” in subtraction ; rewrit- 
ing figures in adding and subtracting fractions. 
In the broad sense any algorism which is used 
during the teaching or learning process tempor- 
arily, to be abandoned completely later, is an 
“accessory algorism” or “crutch.” The objec- 
tions to their use lie in the facts: (1) that skill in 
manipulation is learned in connection with stages 
and forms not characteristic of final practical 
use ; (2) that this implies, psychologically at any 
rate, the waste of learning two forms or usages 
instead of one; and, (3) that it decreases the 
speed with which mathematical calculation is 
done. If there is a drift in any direction, it is prob- 
ably toward the abandonment of “crutches.” 
Full and Short Forms of Calculation 
The division of opinion, which exists in con- 
nection with the temporary use of special algor- 
isms or “crutches,” likewise exists with reference 
88 
 
-P-A-G-E-101
    USE OF SPECIAL FORMS 
to the use of “full forms” and “short forms” 
of manipulation and statement. The temporary 
use of a “full form,” in a case where a “short 
form” will finally be used, is similar to the em- 
ployment of a “crutch.” There is one important 
difference, however, which explains the relatively 
larger presence of temporary “full forms” than 
of “crutches.” The “full form” is an accurate 
form which is used somewhere, — in a more com- 
plex stage of the same process or in some other 
process; the “crutch” is not. Thus: a “full 
form” in column addition with partial totals and 
a final total of partial totals, will be utilized in 
column multiplication, the “long division form” 
of doing “short division ” (which is the fully ex- 
pressed form of dividing by a number of one 
figure) will be utilized in division by numbers of 
more than one figure. 
Forms of Analysis or Reasoning 
The problem of form applies not alone to the 
algorism or special method of computation, but 
likewise to the special methods of reasoning used 
in determining the specific series of steps to be 
89
-P-A-G-E-102
  TEACHING PRIMARY ARITHMETIC 
taken in achieving the answer. In every problem 
the child solves, he must not only decide what is 
to be done (reason), but he must do zz (calculate). 
There are forms of reasoning as there are forms 
of calculation. As any calculation may have 
several algorisms, the solution of a problem may 
be expressed in several forms. It is the latter dif- 
ficulty which appears in the teacher’s demands 
for “formal analysis” of problems. The analysis 
is usually required in full statement. 
The Traditional Requirement of Full Formal 
Analysis 
It has been a very general requirement in 
American schools that the child give a full oral or 
written statement of his analysis and computation. 
Formal statements have been demanded of the 
child as much on the side of reasoning as on that 
of calculation. One of the causes of this demand 
is found in the tendency of the teacher to en- 
courage full statement by the child, merely as 
a revelation of his inner processes so that the 
source of error in results might be detected and 
the error eliminated. We have already noted this 
go 
   
-P-A-G-E-103
  
USE OF SPECIAL FORMS 
predisposition of the teacher to call for full oral 
and written statements for purposes of control in 
the various methods designed to achieve and safe- 
guard accuracy, 
The Limitations of Full Formal Analysis 
There is, however, a marked tendency away 
from formal analysis of arithmetic problems in 
the elementary school, just as there is a move- 
ment away from a formal deductive logic in 
the higher schools. Natural, genetic modes of 
thought are supplanting the unnatural, formal 
statement of steps. It is felt that while such full 
formal statements of reasoning and calculation 
may assist in the teacher’s control, they may 
actually interfere with accuracy and rapidity on 
the child’s part. 
To write out each step in full often means 
giving an enlarged attention to factors that are 
merely touched and assumed in actual thinking. 
To delay the thought process, with attention held 
on a fully developed linguistic statement, whether 
oral or written, may be to distract from the chain 
of essential ideas or meanings that really solve 
91  
-P-A-G-E-104
  TEACHING PRIMARY ARITHMETIC 
the problem. Frequently children lose the thread 
of thought midway of the process because of the 
necessity of dealing with the form side, and have 
to begin anew. 
“Labeling” the Steps of Calculation 
A conservative protest against the old formal 
expression of reasoned steps is found in omitting 
for the most part the linguistic statements deal- 
ing with the logic of the problem and merely 
“labeling” the numbers that occur in the calcu- 
lation. This is a more restricted form of state- 
ment, much more used at the present time than 
hitherto. But it is still open to psychological 
objections that make the more scientific critics 
protest. There are many stages in a calculation 
where there is no association whatever with the 
concrete problem in hand. The concrete problem 
is studied, the decision is made that all the fac- 
tors named are to be added. They are added, 
purely abstractly, and a number is given as the 
total. The result is then thought of in terms 
of the concrete problem in hand. A disposition 
to label each item in the addition may be ne- 
92
-P-A-G-E-105
  
USE OF SPECIAL FORMS 
cessary in the rendering of a bill, but it is a 
false and obstructing activity in the actual solv- 
ing of the problem. The same situation exists 
where there are two or three processes to be 
utilized in series. Once the child has grasped his 
concrete situation and reasoned what to do — he 
may proceed to mechanical manipulation, never 
thinking of the concrete applications till he has 
finished. 
So-called Accuracies of Statement 
The protest mentioned above even goes so far 
as to attack the teacher’s insistence upon certain 
so-called accuracies of statement. The case of 3 
pencils at 5 cents would be expressed 3 times 5 
cents = 15 cents. 3x 5 =15 would be demanded, 
and 5 x 3 not allowed at all. The protest is not 
against insistence on a proper order where “ la- 
beled” statements are used. The objection is 
made against the demand for the so-called proper 
order when abstract figures are related merely 
by signs. Where the child calculates symbol- 
ically, he sees the situation as one to be worked 
out by a purely conventional relation between 
93  
-P-A-G-E-106
TEACHING PRIMARY ARITHMETIC 
  two numbers. For all practical purposes 5 x3 
will solve the situation quite as accurately as 
3x5. The insistence on one, as opposed to the 
other, is a useless effort that cannot affect the 
result. 
Increased Use of Mathematical Symbols 
The same tendency which is making for a re- 
duction of verbal forms is increasing the use of 
mathematical symbols. As logical relations are 
less frequently written out, a simple sign such 
as + or + is used. The algebraic x is supplied 
in place of a whole roundabout series of awkward 
preliminary statements or assumptions. With it, 
of course, come changed methods of manipula- 
tion, as in the use of the algebraic equation. 
It is doubtless true that the rigidity of full 
logical forms is giving way to a more flexible and 
natural mode of expressing the child’s thoughts. 
Fixed oral and written forms of exposition may 
assist the child, much as the acquisition of a 
definite symbol fixes an abstract meaning, which 
remains unwieldy till it attaches itself to a word 
by which it is to be recalled. But increasing care 
94
-P-A-G-E-107
USE OF SPECIAL FORMS 
is manifested that children shall use only those 
forms that will conform to practical need upon 
the one hand, and to natural, efficient, and eco- 
nomical mastery on the other.

EXAMPLES AND PROBLEMS 
Formal and Applied Arithmetic 
Tue teaching of arithmetic is usually classified 
under two aspects, formal work and applied work. 
The formal work deals mainly with the memori- 
zation of fundamental facts, processes, and other 
details of manipulation. The applied work, as 
the name implies, is the formal work utilized in 
the setting of a concrete situation demanding a 
solution. These two aspects of arithmetical in- 
struction are very frequently sharply separated, 
the child working alternately with one or the 
other. The characteristic practice is to deal with 
them without relating them as closely as the 
highest efficiency would demand: 
The Example and the Problem 
Formal exercises in arithmetic are usually pre- 
sented through the “example” ; the exercises in 
application through the “ problem ”’; the distinc. 
96 
 
-P-A-G-E-109
  
  EXAMPLES AND PROBLEMS 
tion being that one isan abstract and symbolical 
statement of numerical facts and the other a con- 
crete and descriptive statement.t In the first 
case the mathematical sign tells the child what 
to do, whether to add, subtract, multiply, or di- 
vide; the example being a kind of pre-reasoned 
problem, the child has only to manipulate ac- 
cording to the sign, his whole attention through- 
out being focused on the formal calculation. In 
the second case the child has two distinct func- 
tions; he must, from the description of the sit- 
uation presented, decide, through the process of 
reasoning, what he is to do (add, subtract, divide, 
or multiply), and having rendered his judgment, 
he must proceed through the formal calculation. 
The Traditional Precedence of Formal Work 
As the problem involves two types of mental 
processes in a single exercise, and the example 
1 While this distinction is not general, it has sufficient cur- 
rency to warrant its use here for the convenience of discus- 
‘sion, The expression “clothed problem” (from the German) 
is occasionally used to mean what is here designated as 
“problem,” and “ abstract problem” is used to mean what is 
here designated as “example.” 
97 
 
-P-A-G-E-110
  TEACHING PRIMARY ARITHMETIC 
but one, the usual procedure in arithmetic is to 
take up the formal side through examples first 
and, later on, the applied side through the use of 
problems. This means that the first emphasis is 
on formal and abstract work rather than on a 
treatment of natural, concrete situations,an em- 
phasis not wholly sanctioned by modern psy- 
chology and the better teaching procedure of 
other subjects. 
Objective and Narrative Presentation as a 
Reform Tendency 
The reform tendency is found mainly in the 
primary grades where the beginnings of new 
processes are made through objective presenta- 
tions of the problem. But the transition from 
objectified problems to formal work is not imme- 
diate. The children pass from objectified situa- 
tions to “number stories,” which are only de- 
scriptions or narratives of a situation. This is 
the interesting primary-school equivalent of that 
more businesslike language description found in 
the higher grades, the arithmetical problem. But 
it precedes formal work and succeeds it, — the 
98
-P-A-G-E-111
EXAMPLES AND PROBLEMS 
formal drill being a mere intermediate drill. 
Here concrete presentations and formal work are 
more closely related and more naturally ordered. 
This reform tendency, which began in the pri- 
mary school, is extending to the higher grades, 
where it is no longer rare to find the attack upona 
process preceded by careful studies of the con- 
crete circumstances in which the process is util- 
ized. In the case of interest, several days might 
be utilized in studying the institution of banking 
in all its more important facts and relations. 
Such an approach not only provides motive for 
the formal and mechanical work, but gives a 
necessary logical basis in fact. Hence the un- 
derstanding of practical business life makes ac- 
curate reasoning possible for the child when he 
is called upon to solve actual problems in appli- 
cation of the formal work. 
The Over-Emphasis of Formal Work 
It is perfectly natural under the general tradi- 
tional practice of putting the first emphasis on 
mastery of formal work that the largest amount 
of attention should be given to the mechanical 
99

  TEACHING PRIMARY ARITHMETIC 
and technical side of arithmetic, and that the 
concrete uses and applications should be slighted, 
and this is generally true of the practice of 
American teachers. Much more ingenuity has 
been used in the careful training of the child on 
the formal side than in teaching him to think out 
his problems. There is no such careful arrang- 
ing and ordering of types in teaching a child 
to reason, as there is in teaching him to cal- 
culate. 
The Need for More Systematic Teaching of 
Reasoning 
Here and there a few thoroughly systematic 
attempts are made to carry the pupil through 
the simple types of one-step reasoning, to two- 
step and three-step problems with their possible 
variations. Just as the example isolates the diffi- 
culties of calculation, by letting the sign + or — 
‘Stand for the logic of the situation, there is a 
tendency to give problems without requiring the 
calculations. This affords a means of isolating 
and treating the special difficulties of reasoning. 
The child is merely required to tell what he 
100
-P-A-G-E-113
  EXAMPLES AND PROBLEMS 
would do, without doing it; the answer being 
checked by the gross facts. A little later, as a 
transition, he is permitted to give a rapid, rough 
approximation of what the answer is likely to be. 
With further command he tells what he would 
do and does it accurately, But such a program 
of teaching is still rare among teachers. 
Existing Devices for Testing Reasoning 
The care of the child’s reasoning is largely 
restricted to testing his comprehension of the 
problem, (1) by having him restate the problem 
to be sure he understands it, or (2) by having 
him give a formal oral or written analysis of the 
way in which he solved the problem. The first 
requirement may not be thoroughgoing, as the 
child may give a verbal repetition of the problem 
without really knowing its meaning. The second 
is a formal analysis of the finished result and 
does not represent the genetic method of the 
child’s thinking. Consequently its formulas do 
not, in any considerable degree, assist him in his 
actual struggle with the complex of facts.

  TEACHING PRIMARY ARITHMETIC 
Sources of Failure in the Solution of Problems 
This lack of a systematic teaching of the tech- 
nique of reasoning is manifest in the unrelia- 
bility of children’s thinking. When a child fails 
in a problem assigned from the text-book, the 
source of the error may be in one or more of 
three phases: (1) In failing to get the meaning 
of the language used to describe the details of 
the situation ; (2) in failing to reason out what 
needs to be done to solve the situation; (3) in 
failing to make an-accurate calculation. The 
first is a matter of language ; the second, one of 
reasoning ; the third, one of memorization. The 
elimination of errors, due to the first and third 
sources, leaves a considerable proportion to be 
accounted for by the second, Such informal in- 
vestigations as have been made seem.to show 
that the children who fail in reasoning do not 
make any real effort to penetrate into the essen- 
tial relations of the situation. They depend on 
their association of processes with specific words 
of relation used in the description of the prob- 
lem, an association determined of course by their

EXAMPLES AND PROBLEMS 
past experiences, As long as these familar “cue” 
words are used, they succeed. Let unfamiliar 
words or phrases be utilized in their stead or let 
the relation be implied, and, like as not, the 
children will fail to do the right thing. Practical 
school people are familiar with the fact that 
children solve the problems given in the lan- 
guage of their own teachers and fail when the 
problems are set by principals or superintend- 
ents, whose language is strange to them. 
The Need of Varied Presentations of Problems 
A varied use of materials in the objective 
presentation of problems, and a more constantly 
varied use of language in the descriptive pre- 
sentation of problems would prevent the child 
from making such superficial and unthought- 
ful associations, and force him to think out 
connections between what is essential in a | 
typical problem and the appropriate process of 
manipulating it. But such a deliberate applica- 
tion of modern psychology is far from being a 
conspicuous minority movement. The subject- 
matter of the problems given to children has, 
103. 
   
-P-A-G-E-116
TEACHING PRIMARY ARITHMETIC 
however, improved greatly. Obsolete, puzzling, 
and unreal situations, which only hinder the 
child’s attempt to reason, are less and less used 
in problem work. 
Improvement in the Subject-Matter of Problems 
Daily it becomes recognized with greater clear- 
ness that right reasoning depends upon a com- 
prehension of the facts of the case, and the 
facts of the case in point must be within the 
experience of the child. This is the only way 
in which a problem can be real and concrete 
to him, 
Real and Concrete Problems Taken from the 
Larger Social World 
The recent effort on the part of text-book 
writers and teachers to make arithmetical prob- 
lems “real” and “concrete” has not always 
recognized the above-mentioned psychological 
principle. The terms “real” and “concrete” 
have been interpreted in many ways besides in 
terms of the child’s consciousness. With some, 
“real” has meant “ material” ; and the problems, 
104 
 
-P-A-G-E-117
  EXAMPLES AND PROBLEMS 
more particularly with primary children, have, 
in increasing degree, been presented by objects 
or words connoting very vivid images. Others 
have defined this quality in terms of actual exist- 
ence or use in the larger social world. If these 
problems actually occur at the grocer’s, the 
banker’s, or the wholesaler’s, it is said that they 
“are indeed concrete.” And much effort has 
been expended in carrying these current prob- 
lems into the classroom, in spite of the fact that 
they may be neither comprehensible nor interest- 
ing to the pupil. 
Real and Concrete Problems Taken from the 
Child's Own Life 
There is another social world, nearer home to 
the child, from which a more vital borrowing can 
be made. There is an opportunity to use the 
child’s life in its quantitative aspects, to take his 
plays, games, and occupations, and introduce 
their situations into his mathematical teaching. 
As his world expands from year to year, he will 
be carried by degrees from personal and local 
situations to those of general interest. The 
105
-P-A-G-E-118
TEACHING PRIMARY ARITHMETIC 
teacher can provide this progression without de- 
vitalizing the facts presented. 
The Imaginative or Hypothetical Problem 
There is another error into which both the 
socially-minded radical and the specialist in child 
study fall. In. their eagerness to improve the 
arithmetical problem, they assume that problems 
taken from the larger social world or from the 
child’s experience are necessarily superior to hy- 
pothetical, imaginative, or “ made-up” problems. 
The psychological fact that needs to be forced 
upon the attention of the reformers is that, with 
proper artfulness, an imagined problem may be 
even more vital and real to the child than one 
taken from life —as a situation in a drama may 
be more appealing and real to a child than one on 
the street. This has some recognition, but not 
enough. Those who stand upon the side of the 
“made-up” problems are more likely to be re- 
actionaries who tolerate the traditional type of 
problem even though its stupid artificiality is ob- 
vious to both the teacher and the child. They 
might better be dealing with dull problems bor- 
106 
 
-P-A-G-E-119
  
EXAMPLES AND PROBLEMS 
rowed from real life than with specially invented 
dullness. 
Valid Arguments for Actual Problems 
Of course there is another argument for the 
use of actual social materials. The child must 
ultimately come into command of precisely these 
facts, since their mastery will be demanded by 
the business world. But must a primary school 
child study his arithmetic through problems 
taken from the dreary statistics of imports and 
exports merely because tariff reform is a polit- 
ical issue which every citizen ought finally to 
comprehend? There is a time for this, and, as 
is the case with most of such borrowed busi- 
ness problems, the time is later. In so far as 
these are current situations within the con- 
tacts of child life, let them enter. A quan- 
titative revelation of life is important; and it 
is good teaching economy to gain knowledge 
by the way, provided it does not distract 
attention from whatever main business is at 
hand. 
107 
 
-P-A-G-E-120
    TEACHING PRIMARY ARITHMETIC 
Unity in the Subject-Matter of Problems 
The socializing of arithmetical problems has 
one other additional good effect. It has tended 
to bring some topical unity into the problems 
constituting the assignment for a given lesson, 
or group of lessons. Hitherto, a series of prob- 
lems was almost always composed of a hetero- 
geneous lot of situations. There was no unity 
save that some one process was involved in each. 
The movement is now in the direction of attain- 
ing a more approximate unity within the subject- 
matter of the problems themselves, The difficul- 
ties of attainment have restricted this movement 
to more progressive circles. 
The Eclectic Source of Problems 
The eclectic source of arithmetic problems is 
apparent from the foregoing discussion. It would 
seem that some better texts would naturally be 
evolved through the implied criticism of each 
movement upon the other. Such is the case. 
Problems from child life emphasize the begin- 
ning condition to which adjustment must be 
108
-P-A-G-E-121
EXAMPLES AND PROBLEMS 
made in all good teaching. Those from the 
greater world suggest the final goals of instruc- 
tion. Those “made up” by the teacher call 
attention to what is too often forgotten, that the 
educative process in school may be artful with- 
out becoming artificial. Teaching is art, and 
when well done is not less effective for the fact.
-P-A-G-E-122
XII 
CHARACTERISTIC MODES OF PROGRESS IN 
TEACHING METHOD 
Variation in Method, and its Causes 
Tue existing methods of teaching arithmetic in 
the American elementary schools are exceed- 
ingly varied. This is due to many causes. The 
democratic system of local control, as opposed 
to a centralized supervision of schools, has in- 
creased both the possibility and the probability of 
variation. Even within the units of supervision 
(state, county, and municipal) the opportunity 
for reducing variation in the direction of a more 
efficient uniformity is lost. This is partly due to 
the lack of a thoroughly trained staff of super- 
visors of the teaching process. Uniformity be- 
yond the legal units of supervision has been 
restricted by the lack of organized professional 
means for investigation of and experimentation 
in controversial matters. Even such crude ex- 
110
-P-A-G-E-123
PROGRESS IN TEACHING METHOD 
periments as are being tried in more than one 
class room, school, or system are unknown, un- 
reported, unestimated, because no competent 
professional body gathers, evaluates, and diffuses 
such knowledge. In this respect the teaching 
profession is far below the efficient organization 
of the legal and medical professions. 
Characteristic Traditions and Reforms 
It is exceedingly difficult therefore to analyze 
the characteristic aspects of teaching method 
except as these are interpreted in movements of 
general significance. These may be actual or 
potential, traditional or reformatory, general or 
local in present acceptance. The situation is one 
wherein tradition is mixed with radicalism, and 
radicalism modified by reaction. In this medley 
of movements there are dominant tendencies 
both traditional and progressive. 
Forces for Progress in Method 
It is quite impossible to indicate the progres- 
sive tendencies with clearness save in connection 
with the discussions of concrete difficulties in . 
Ir
-P-A-G-E-124
TEACHING PRIMARY ARITHMETIC 
mathematical teaching. The forces that are be- 
hind these tendencies may, however, be summa- 
rized here. For convenience, they may be classi- 
fied into eight types of influence, extending from 
more or less vague and general movements to 
very particular, scientific contributions. No at- 
tempt is made to indicate the achievement of 
each ; the form of each influence is only roughly 
defined, and illustrative movements or studies 
are suggested :— 
General Pedagogical Movements 
(1) It is obvious that any general pedagogical 
movement that influences the professional atti- 
tude of teachers will influence the special meth- 
ods of mathematical teaching. The appearance 
of the doctrine of interest made mathematical 
instruction less formal. The growing enthusi- | 
asm for objective work enlarged the use of ob- 
jects in the arithmetic period. The child study 
movement laid emphasis upon the child’s own 
plays and games as a source of problems and ex- 
amples. 
  112
-P-A-G-E-125
  PROGRESS IN TEACHING METHOD 
Special Pedagogical Movements 
(2) Certain special movements in methods of 
teaching, local to the subject of mathematics, 
have also been effective. Here one has only to 
recall the “Grube” method, with its influence 
on the order and thoroughness with which the 
elements of arithmetic are taught. 
Daily Trial and Error 
(3) The tendency of every teacher, who is at 
all sensitive to the defects of his methods, is to 
vary his daily practice. Constant trial, with error 
eliminating and success justifying a departure, is 
thus a source of progress. The new devices of 
one teacher are taken up by the eager profes- 
sional witness, and innovation is thus diffused, 
We have no ability to measure how much pro- 
fessional progress is due to individual variation 
in teaching and its conscious and unconscious 
imitation. The disposition of school systems to 
send their teachers on tours of visitation without 
loss of salary is a recognition of the value of 
this method of advance. 
113  
-P-A-G-E-126
  TEACHING PRIMARY ARITHMETIC 
Experimentation of Progressive Teachers 
(4) A far more efficient and radical source of 
change than that just mentioned is the delib- 
erate, conscious, experimental teaching of pro- 
gressive individuals. Some new idea or device 
occurs to the teacher of original mind, and it is 
tried out with a fair proportion of resulting suc- 
cesses, An illustration of such a contribution is 
found in one conspicuous effort to get more rapid 
column addition. The first columns to be added 
were allowed to determine the selection and 
order of addition combinations learned. Thus if 
6+7+9+6+7=35 is the first column to be used, 
then the first combinations mastered will be 
6+7=13, 3+9=12, 2+6=8, 8+7=15. Arising 
as a fruitful idea and seeming to give a measure 
of success, it has been carried, in the particular 
locality in mind, from school to school, and from 
system to system. 
Reconstruction through Psychological Criticism 
(5) A prolific source of radical change is found 
in the critical application of modern psychology 
114 
 
-P-A-G-E-127
  
. PROGRESS IN TEACHING METHOD 
to teaching methods. Algorisms, types of diffi- 
culty, the order and gradation of these, as well 
as many other factors in method have been rad- 
ically reorganized on psychological grounds. Ex- 
amples of such psychological modifications of 
method are found in the “Courses of Study for 
the Day Elementary Schools of the City of San 
Francisco.” Still more extensive critical applica- 
tions are found in the “ Exercises in Arithmetic” 
devised by Dr. E. L. Thorndike, Professor of 
Educational Psychology in Teachers College, 
Columbia University. 
Studies in the Special Psychology of 
Mathematics 
(6) Attempts have been made to inquire into 
the special psychology of arithmetical processes 
through careful experimentation and control. 
They have not been numerous, nor have’ they 
been influential on current practice. Such a field 
needs development. A typical attempt to investi- 
gate and formulate the special psychology of 
number is found in a Clark University study of 
115

“Number and its Application Psychologically 
Considered,” 
  Investigations of Existing Methods 
(7) Educational investigations as to the effi- 
ciency of existing arithmetical teaching among 
school systems, sufficiently varied to be repre- 
sentative of American practice, have also been 
conducted. These have usually gone beyond the 
field of the special methods of presentation em- 
ployed in the classroom, and have inquired into 
the conditions of administration and supervision, 
the arrangement of the courses of study, and 
other similar factors. Dr. J. M. Rice’s studies into 
“The Causes of Success and Failure in Arith- 
metic”? investigated such specific factors as: 
The environment from which children come, their 
age, time allotment of the subject, period of school 
day given to arithmetic, arrangement of home 
work, standards, examinations, etc. A subsequent

study of similar type, but employing more refined 
methods, is that of Dr. C. W. Stone on “Arith- 
metical Abilities and some Factors determining 
them.” The main problem of this study was to 
find the correlation between types of arithmet- 
ical ability and different time expenditures and 
courses of study. These two studies have prob- 
ably attracted more general notice than any other 
studies of arithmetical instruction. While they 
have largely dealt with administrative conditions 
that limit teaching method, rather than with the 
details of teaching method itself, they have stim- 
ulated the impulse to investigate conditions and 
practices of every type. 
Special Experiments in Controlled Comparative 
Teaching 
(8) The latest source of progress in teaching 
method is found in the movement for compara- 
tive experimental teaching under normal but care- 
fully controlled conditions. Several such exper- 
iments are being conducted in the Horace Mann

bia University, under the direction of Principal 
Henry C. Pearson, with the co-operation of the 
staff of Teachers College. This experimental 
work is designed to determine primarily the 
relative value of competing methods in actual 
use throughout the country, the assumption being 
that every substantial difference in practice im- 
plies a difference of theory and consequently a 
controversy that can be resolved only on the 
basis of careful comparative tests. Two parallel 
series of classes of about the same age, ability, 
teacher equipment, etc., are selected for this 
work. One series is taught by one method ; the 
other series by the other method. The abilities 
of these children are measured both before and 
after the teaching, and the growth compared. 
The standards and methods of this type of com- 
parative experimentation, together with a list of 
current competitive methods requiring investiga- 
tion, are given in Dr. David Eugene Smith’s

REPORT, 
The Superintendent again calls attention to the carelessness of 
many County Superintendents in making the annual reports re- 
quired of them by iaw. In many cases, they must be written to 
time and again, and urged repeatedly, to attend to this very im- 
portant matter before they respond, and then, when their reports 
ave received, they are so carelessly prepared that they must be 
returned for correction more than once before they can be accepted. 
After repeated reminders of their duty sent them from this office, 
the superintendents of a number of counties have failed to report in 
full. 
By their refusal to heed the requirements of this office, in the 
discharge of the duties of their positions, they seriously reflect on 
their own competency, and demonstrate their utter lack of interest 
in the highly responsible position to which they have been elected. 
But it is very gratifying to know that such officials in our pub- 
lic school system are becoming fewer every year, and that, under 
the wise legislation requiring the examination of candidates for the 
county superintendency, it is confidently expected that hereafter it 
will be next to impossible tor incompetent and eareless persons to 
succeed in beivg chosen to lead the educational forces of the various 
counties. i 
While we feel the necessity of criticising some of the careless 
superintendents, we must, in justice to the greaf majority of those 
holding this responsible position, testify to their unwearying devo- 
tion to their work, and to their eminent fitness to mold public 
schoo] sentiment. Occasion is taken here to express our sincere 
thanks to the County Superintendents who have so cheerfully re- 
sponded to the requirements of their position, and who have so 
zealously labored to improve the schools under their supervision. 
It is only by the constant co-operation of the school officials that ; 
our public school system will tend toward that perfection for which 
we are so earnestly striving.
-P-A-G-E-11
MY (yeh 
Instrrutres For TEACHERS. 
The reports from superintendents relative to County Institutes 
are of a very encouraging nature. In nearly every county in the 
State during the past year were these Institutes held. Their aver- 
age duration ws from five to ten days, though in a few instances 
they were continued for a longer period of time. In the main they 
were conducted by local talent and supported by the superintendent 
and the teachers in attendance, though in a few cases special con- 
ductors were employed. The County Courts are becoming more 
liberal in their views as to the appropriation of special funds for 
this purpose, which is taken as a most favorable indication in the 
developing and perfecting of our system of popular instruction. 
We sincerely trust that the day is not far distant when every 
County Court in the State will entertain broad and liberal views of 
the value of the instruction given in these Institutes or Summer 
Normals, and that they will generously provide for their support. 
A great complaint is raised in nearly every portion of the State 
because of lack of sufficient funds to continue the schools for 
longer terms, and the members of the County Courts hearing this 
ery from the teachers conclude oftentime that every cent of school 
money expended outside of the salaries of teachers is money lost, 
and, guided by this misleading representation, they refuse to appro- 
priate for summer schools of instruction for teachers. 
I have no hesitancy in saying that the great need of the public 
schools to-day is better teachers—teachers trained and fitted and 
prepared for teaching. Our teachers, many of them, need not 
only pedagogical lectures and professional training, but actual in- 
struction in the branches required to be taught in the public 
schools. As a general proposition, I may safely assert that the 
public school teachers of Tennessee need teaching, and I know of 
no place where they can, as a class, receive such instruction outside 
of the Institutes. All cannot attend the Institutes supported by 
the State and by the Peabody fund; so they find it necessary, if 
they receive instruction at all, to spend their time in the humbler 
- County Normals. 
That these meetings are not what they should he, in every par- 
ticular, is very evident; that they are oftentimes conducted by in- 
ferior talent, is admittd; but, with all these weaknesses, they 
oceupy a field that otherwise would be left untilled. Their tend- 
ency is in the right direction, and they should be heartily and gen- 
erously supported by public school officials.

The Institutes were in session a total of 100 days, and the total 
enrollment was 1,011. 
To my worthy predecessor, Capt. Frank M. Smith, much credit 
is due for the gratifying results of these Institutes. He ably 
planned the work, and wisely selected the instructors, before my 
induction into office, and the success recorded in the reports of the 
conductors of the six Institutes should be considered as a testimo- 
nial to his sound judgment and executive ability. 
More funds are needed for Institute purposes. Last year we re- 
ceived $1,200 from the Peabody Education Fund, in addition to 
the regular appropriation of $1,500 from the State. A much 
larger amount could be profitably expended, and it is recommended 
that the Stute increase the appropriation for the professional in- 
struction and training of the teachers of the public schools. 
I submit the reports of the conductors of the six State Institutes.

KNOXVILLE. 
Kwoxvinir, Tenn., August 9, 1895. 
Fon. 8. G. Gilbreath, State Superintendent of Public Instruction : 
Str—The State Peabody Institute held in Knoxville was opened 
July 1, and continued for a period of three weeks. The Board of 
Education kindly tendered the use of the Girls’ High School build- 
ing for the sessions of the Institute, and the room in which they 
were held was crowded from the beginning. 
The attendance was regular, the interest manifestly deep and 
sincere, and, on the whole, it might be called an enthusiastic Insti- 
tute. We were indebted both to the State Superintendent and the 
former Superintendent, Hon, Frank M. Smith, tor stirring addresses 
on patriotic education. The first week’s evrollment was 139 
teachers, which increased until 208 names were finally on the regis- 
ter. The following counties were represented: Knox, Sevier, 
Roane, Blount, Anderson, Grainger, Union and Sumner. Teachers 
were in attendance from the following States: Tennessee, Florida,
-P-A-G-E-14
eo 
Mississippi, South Carolina, West Virginia, Iowa and Alabama. 
The course of studies prescribed by the State Superintendent was 
carried out as far as possible, and an honest effort was made to in- 
spire the teachers with a high appreciation of the responsibilties 
of their profession, as well as to instruct them in the theory and — 
practice of teaching. Superindent J. C. Ford, of Knox County, 
and principal J. H. McCallie, of the Knoxville city schools, and 
the undersigned constituted the faculty, and all were busily en- 
gaged each day along different lines of study. I feel that my 
special thanks are due Messrs. Ford and McCallie, as earnest, in- 
telligent and enthusiastic workers, whose sole aim was to be of 
genuine service to their fellow-teachers. Mrs. Gennie Mynders, 
of the Knoxville city schools, showed herself a most accomplished 
primary teacher, having for two weeks before the Institute classes 
of small children, illustrating with them practically how to teach. 
Her sensible and striking methods of gaining and holding the 
attention of the little folk, and imparting real instruction to them, 
were of decided benefit to the witnessing teachers. 
Superintendent Ruth, of the Knoxville city schools, gave several 
valuable pedagogical lectures before the Institute; and Principal 
White, of the Girls’ High School, also assisted. During the first 
week Mr, Himel gave several practical talks upon teaching arith- 
metic; also Mr. W. W. Reagan and Mr. J. T. Mallicoat, teachers 
of long experience, gave some valuable hints upon teaching. 
Misses Mamie M. and Carrie L. Patton, as a music committee, 
were untiring in their efforts to vary with pleasing music the regu- 
lar routine, and to them and Miss Augusta Hood, organist, we are 
indebted for mach pleasure. The singing of the Chime Quartette 
was highly enjoyed by the Institute. Secretary Ben H. Davis was 
a most zealous helper, and his services were invaluable. 
The cordial co-operation of all these parties shows that the In- 
stitute had the sympathy and moral support of the educational 
masses of the community in which it was held, and this fact speaks 
well in its favor. 
As no examination was held last year in the Knoxville Institute, 
written ones, both primary and secondary, were held at the close of 
this one, July 18, 19. The results of these have heretofore been 
submitted to you. Respectfully submitted, 
A.D. Wiarton, Conductor.

CHATTANOOGA. 
Cuatraxooga, TENN., July 6, 1895. 
Hon. 8. G. Gilbreath, State Superintendent of Public Instruction : 
Dear Str—We have the honor to submit the following report 
of the Peabody Normal Institute held in Chattanooga, beginning 
on the 10th day of June, 1895, and continuing one month: 
We deem it proper to say, in the beginning of this report, that 
the delay of the Legislature in granting the appropriation for insti- 
tute purposes made our Institute a matter of uncertainty until June 
3, only seven days prior to the opening, so that it was impossible to 
give proper notice of its opening. Notwithstanding this fact, about 
fifty members were enrolled the first hour of the session, and the 
number increased from day to day uatil the record showed an at- 
tendance of one hundred and thirty-five. 
The teachers of this section of the State are delighted at the 
prospects of having a permanent summer school of methods in their 
midst, and those in attendance showed their appreciation of the same 
by punctuality and earnest, faithful work. 
The faculty, consisting of Dr. W. R. Garrett and Prof. James W. 
Sewell, of Nashville and Superintendents A. T. Barrett and H. D. 
Huffaker of Chattanooga, organized by electing Dr. Garrett Presi- 
dent,and H. D. Huffaker Secretary. Miss Grace McCallie and W. 
F. Huffaker were appointed to assist the Secretary in enrolling 
members and recording the proceedings. 
This being the first year of the Institute, no classes were formed 
for the secondary course of study, and the entire Institute was or- 
ganized into one class for instruction in the brauches of study 
enumerated in the first year’s course. 
’ The several branches of study were assigned to the instructors as 
follows: 
W. R&. Garrett.—History of Tennessee, History of the United 
States, and Geography. 
A. T. Barrett.—Arithmetic, Elementary Science, White’s School 
Manansgement, White’s Elements of Pedagogy, and Watts on the 
Mind. 
James W. Sewell—Language Lessons, English Grammar, and 
Physiology. 
H. D. Huffaker—Orthography, Reading, Penmansphip, Parker’s
-P-A-G-E-16
pees 
Talks on Teaching, and Page’s Theory and Practice of Teaching. 
Mrs. Ada J. Harmon, Principal of Hill City school, also did 
some interesting work in geography. 
The daily sessions began at 8:00 a.M., and closed at nooa, the 
afternoons being devoted to study. This plan was heartily ap- 
proved by the faculty and teachers, as it afforded ample opportunity 
for a thorough preparation of the lessons assigued. 
Two afternoons of the third week and three of the last were de- 
voted to rigid examination of applicants for promotion from the 
primary to the seondary course. The standard for promotion fixed 
by the faculty made it necessary for applicants to attain a general 
average of at least eighty-five (85), and not fall below eighty (80) 
in any branch. 
The following persons made the required grades and were pro- 
moted to the secondary course:

NASHVILLE. 
NasHVILieE, TEnn., August 8, 1895. 
Hon. 8. G. Gilbreath, State Superintendent of Public Instruction: 
Sitr—The State Peabody Institute, held in this city, was opened 
June 3, 1895, in the Peabody College building by Chancellor W. 
H. Payne, of the University of Nashville, assisted by Miss Aris- 
tine G. Gloyer, principal of Winthrop Model School. At tie close 
of the first week there was an enrollment of sixty-five teachers, 
and Chancellor Payne being called away, the work for the remain- 
ing three weeks of the session was carried on by Prof. C. E. Little, 
of the Peabody Normal College, Miss Glover and myself. 
By the close of the session the enrollment had reached 154 
teachers, the average belonging being 100, and the average attend- 
ance 85. These numbers show a much larger attendance than has 
ever been had in any State Institute held in this city, and, while a 
large majority of the teachers were from Davidson County, there 
was still a goodly number from other counties in the State, and 
there were several even from other States. 
The interest and spirit prevailing throughout the entire session 
was of the finest kind, and extremely gratifying. Every instructor 
felt himself strengthened and sustained in his work by as earnest 
and attentive body of auditors as any speaker would desire. I 
voice the sentiments of the faculty as I herewith return their thanks 
to the collective body of teacher-pupils who gave them their un- 
flagging attention throughout the whole session. 
The faculty carried out, as far as possible, both the letter and 
spirit of the Institute SylNabus issued from the office of the State 
Superintendent. At the close, June 28, both primary and secondary 
examinations were held, the results of which have heretofore been 
‘submitted to you. It was in the air that good was accomplished at 
this Institute, and instructors and students alike felt that a decided 
advance had been made along all the lines of public instruction. 
In every way all felt satisfied, and agreed that it was a success.

The following named gentlemen attended the Peabody State In- 
stitute, Nashville, Tenn., 1895, and completed in a satisfactory 
manner the course of study prescribed by the State Superintendent 
for the Peabody Institutes of Tennessee, and have been granted a 
first grade certificate, which places them on the “ Roll of Honor,” 
and exempts them from further examination, and the same are en- 
titled to an annual renewal of this certificate without examination: 
Supt. A. H. Wright, Nashville, Tenn. ; Prof. Howard W. Chaffin, 
Nashville, Tedn.; Prof. Charles H. Stetson, Nashville, Tenn.; 
Prof. J. H. Sikes, Goodlettsville, Tenn. 
The faculty worked together in unity of purpose and harmony of 
design, and, as the one left in charge when, unfortunately, our dis- 
tinguished Chancellor was called away, I desire to return my sin- 
cere thanks to my co-laborers, Miss Glover and Professor Little, 
for their zealous and hearty co-operation. Professors J. E. Bailey, 
Robert L. Cave and P. H. Manning kindly lent valuable assistance 
during the session. Very respectfully, 
A. D. Warton, Conductor. 
HARTSVILLE, 
NasHvi.uz, Tenn., August 18, 1895. 
Hon. 8. G. Gilbreath, Superintendent of Public Instruction: 
Dear Srr—I have the honor to submit the report of the Pea- 
body Institute held at Hartsville, Tenn., July 22-26, 1895: 
In accordance with your announcemeut the Institute was opened 
Monday, July 22, at 9:30 a.m., and was conducted in accordance 
with your general instructions; holding two sessions each day, and 
two night sessions. " 
Iu the division of work, I gave instruction in geography, history 
and mathematics, Miss Mary Myers gave instruction in spelling, 
reading, writing, English, and some portions of geography. In 
other portions of the work we were indebted to the local teachers 
for valuable assistance. Excellent work was done by County Su- 
perintendent Charles Martin, Miss Sallie Chambers, and by Pro- 
fessors A. J. Hibbett, J. R. Burton, Averett, Kirby and Griffin. 
During the last two days the Institute was favored with the 
presence and valuable services of Capt. C. S. Douglass, of Gallatin, 
who gave instruction in pedagogy and other subjects.
-P-A-G-E-20
ug 
The total number of teachers enrolled, as shown in the minutes, 
was fifty-five. The County Superinterintendent informs me that 
several teachers were in attendance whose names were not enrolled. 
The total number of teachers in attendance was more than sixty. 
The report of the State Superintendent of Public Instruction for 
1894 shows that the total number of white teachers employed in 
Trousdale Couvty was twenty-one. It thus appears that the attend- 
ance at the Institute numbered nearly three iimes as many teachers 
as those employed in the county. This is due to the fact that 
many attended from adjoining counties, and that many others were 
teachers who had failed to obtain employment. 
In addition to the regular attendance of teachers there were a 
large number of visitors who testified by their presence their warm 
public interest in education. The attendance of visitors was espe- 
ceially large at the night sessions, being estimated at about 400. The 
total attendance of teachers and visiters at the different sessions of 
the Institute was greater than 600. 
The visit of the State Supreintendent, and his able address, gave 
‘additional interest to the last two days of the Institute. 
I cannot close this report without testifying to the excellent work 
of my associate instructor, Miss Mary Myers, of Nashville. Her 
instruction was accurate, inspiring and valuable. 
County Snperintendent, Charles Martin, presided over the meet- 
ing with skill, and much of the success was due to his energy and 
diligence, which was exerted iu preparing the way beforehand, and 
in conducting the business affairs during the session. 
Miss Sallie Chambers is one of the best Institute secretaries in 
the State, as may be seen from the minutes of the Institute here- 
with appended. 
Rev. Mr. McPeak attended nearly every meeting, and took an 
active part in the work. 
Hon. M. C, Fitzpatrick, the former County Superintendent, and 
now Representative of Trousdale County, contributed to the interest 
by his presence, by his active co-operation and by his able addresses. 
Senator A. B. Newsom was present during the latter part of the 
Institute, and testified much interest in its proceedings. 
At no place in the State hive the people shown more cordial in- 
oy in Institute work than at the hospitable town of Hartsville. 
Respectfully submitted, 
W. R. Garrett, Conductor.

UNION CITY. 
Hon. 8. G. Gilbreath, Superintendent of Public Instruction : 
Dear Str—The following I most respectfully submit as my re- 
port of a joint Institute held at Union City, beginning June 24, and 
continuing for one month: 
Although the eppropriation for Institute work was very late in 
being made, and but little time allowed for advertising this Insti- 
tute, yet from its very opening a complete success seemed assured, 
for our seats were nearly filled upon the first day, and every teacher 
seemed anxious for the work, and entered the school, as it were, re- 
solved to cultivate every opportunity presented. In obedience to 
instruction from the State Departmeht we adopted the primary 
course of study and syllabus for Peabody State Institutes, and all 
the while adhered closely to the text. 
Our plan of instruction was by recitation and lecture, but largely 
by the former, being satisfied that our teachers in the primary 
course are not Se prepared for the lecture method. Each 
study in course received its allotted care and attention under the 
supervision of willing and competent instructors, who, as required, 
placed their work neatly and carefully upon the board, and ina 
professional manner demonsirated whereof they taught. Right 
here permit me to say that in my long course of Institute work I 
have never before found better local talent than was assembled in 
this Institute. Two sessions were held each day, clusing at 4:30 
o’clock, and all the time given to essential, practical work, each 
study occupying its own appropriate division. There were in at- 
tendance two hundred and three (203) teachers during Institute, 
among them many representative educators of that portion of the 
State. At the close of the Institute there was held an examination 
of three days, and of the sixty-five applicants (65) for certificates 
in primary Peabody course, only fifteen were successful. This ex- 
amination, whilst close, was intended to be practical and pointed, 
and we are fully satisfied that even handed justice was meted out 
to all alike. 
Tam free to confess that most of the success of this Institute is 
due to the strong, practical and energetic Superintendent, J. H. 
Jackson, who, during the entire session, never wavered in his duty 
or relaxed his efforts in the discharge of every obligation. He de- 
servedly has a strong hold upon his people, as well upon his teachers. 
 
-P-A-G-E-22
ReaD ee eo 
Our efficient Secretary, Miss Ida Zimmerman, was active and at- 
tentive, and did us good work, and is certainly entitled to much 
eredit for her gratuitous labor during the Institute. 
My assistant, Miss Mary Duval, is certainly at home in her 
specialties, United States and Tennessee History, and is as easy and 
fluent in her class instruction as she is gifted in superior journalism. 
She certainly did her whole duty in the school-room, and by a 
uniform and courteous affability won a host of friends among 
teachers and citizens alike. 
Miss Butler, of Trenton, in lier structural map of Tennessee, and 
Miss Williams, of Union City, in her lessons in primary arithmetic, 
deserve special mention, for they certainly aided us materially 
during the session. Professors Williams, Brice, Willingham, Cook, 
Cashdollar and Collam, all strong men, and occupying high posi- 
tions in the profession, responded promptly to every call, and made 
themselves felt in their respective lines. We certainly are deeply 
indebted to them, and to all others who so willingly and efficiently 
rendered us their valuable aid. 
We were visited often during the session by prominent schoo 
men of the State, which gave us much encouragement, but espe- 
cially would I mention your visit, and the strong and telling words 
that you gave us upon school legislation, the purposes of the In- 
stitute, and the cultivation of patriotism among the yonng men 
and women of ourage. I can truly say that your visit did us 
much good. 
There is another feature of this Institute that I would mention, 
and that is the deep interest manifested by the citizens, for not a 
session was held but that we had a good representation of the 
people, and especially did the ministers of the gospel encourage us 
in every posssible way. 
Two entertainments were given at night which were largely at- 
tended by the people, and was but another manifestation of the 
genuine enthusiasm felt by the good citizens of Union City in the 
cause of education and the maintenance of the grand Institute 
system so generously aided by Mr. Curry, the representative of the 
great philanthropist, George Peabody. 
In conclusion I would reiterate in substance what I have so often 
affirmed in regard to the Institute methods, viz.: That I know of 
‘no means at band more practical by which the people, the directory
-P-A-G-E-23
COD 
and texchers can be reached and enthused. Am satisfied that our 
system is just now assuming newer and higher proportions ; that our 
people are demanding stronger men and women in the work ; that 
a cultivated thoroughness and a practical experience must play an 
important part; in truth, that our public school system must no 
longer play the “baby act,” but stand squarely upon its own merits. 
This it can, and will do. These Institutes I regard as prime factors 
in this great work. Already are they making themselves felt, and 
it will require but a few years, I imagine, under the four weeks 
system, as inaugurated under the wise judgment of Mr. Curry, un- 
til our entire country will present one solid phalanx of well equipped 
teachers, and the entire system be but one continuous graded school. 
That much of this important work will devolve upon you, sir, is 
true, yet I feel that your whole soul is enlisted in the cause, and if 
your willing and’ responsive action in your short executive past be 
any criterion upon which to base the future, I shall entertain no 
misgivings, but will be fully satisfied that our educational bark is 
under the safe guidance of a trusty pilot, and from every quarter 
will come the “ watch-word and reply,” “All’s well.” 
? * Respectfully, 
: C. 8. Doveiass, Conductor. 
JACKSON, 
Jackson, TENN., July 22, 1895. 
Hon. 8. G. Gilbreath, State Superintendent of Public Instruction : 
Dear Sir—We have the honor to submit the following report 
of the third aunual session of the Peabody State Lustitute, located 
at Jackson, Tenn. The faculty appointed by you divided the work 
as follows: : 
Thomas H. Paine, President and Instructor in School Law and 
Supervision, Institutes, Civil Government and Discipline. 
8. A. Mynders, Secretary and Instructor in Pedagogy, Psychol- 
ogy, Grammar, Rhetoric, Physiolozy, Book-keeping and Agri- 
culture. ‘ 
Wharton S. Jones, Arithmetic, Algebra, Geography, and Geology. 
G. R. MeGee, History, Geometry, and Physics. 
At the close of the session of 1894, we impressed upon the 
teachers the necessity of a thorough study of the course for the 
next year, and we are pleased to report that, from the work of the
-P-A-G-E-24
ESS at Z 
secondary class this session, we believe our advice was followed. 
The session of 1895 was opened June 17, with Thomas H. Paine, 
President, aad S. A. Mynders, Secretary. 
The teachers were divided into two classes. Those who were in 
attendance last session, and passed the examinations with the re- 
quired average of 85 per cent., were assigned to a separate room, 
and designated as the ‘ Senior Class.” All others were assigned to 
the Junior Class. In this way the work of the two departments 
was carried on simultaneously. In the senior room only the sec- 
ondary school studies, with the professional work for the second 
year, were taught; and in the junior room the primary school stud- 
ies and professional work for the first year. 
We endeavored to make the Institute a practical training school. 
Regular lessons were assigned and prepared and the instructors 
reviewed with the teachers the subject-matter of each study, and 
exhibited methods of teaching and managing. The extent of the 
work and iis character may be gathered from the following sum- 
*mary: : 
Thomas H. Paine gave prominence to grading the district 
schools, and showed conclusively that this could be successfully 
done. He dwelt upon the difficuties attending the introduction of 
a graded system into the schools, and showed how they could be 
overcome. The result of his practical instruction will be seen in 
the large number of teachers that will grade their schools this fall. 
In his lectures on “ Discipline,” he emphasized the fact’ that the 
teacher must govern without appearing to do so. He called atten- 
tion to the common mistakes made by teachers, and how they should 
be corrected. His work on this subject was alapted to the com- 
mon schools, and was the result of experience rather than theory. 
In his work on Institutes, etc., he reviewed the history of these 
organizations in the State, and emphasized the valuable help that 
had been given by Hon. J. L. M. Curry, agent of the Board of 
Trustees of the Peabody Education Fund, both in money and sug- 
gestions. He also reviewed the history of the public school system 
of the State. Captain Paine gave instruction to both the junior 
and senior classes. 
Mr. G. R. McGee gave daily instruction to the junior class in 
United States*and Tennessee history. In the former, he commenced 
with discoveries, and, by regular lessons, carried the class down to
-P-A-G-E-25
: ods 
the present time, emphasizing the philosophy of history, and the 
methods of teaching it. In Tennessee history he devoted consid- 
erable time to the growth of our institutions, and the part Tennes- 
see has taken in making the history of the nation. In the senior 
class Mr. McGee gave daily instruction in geometry and the history 
of education. The class was carried through a careful review of 
hese subjects by model recifations. Mr. McGee’s extensive re- 
search and experience make him one of the ablest teachers in this 
department in the country, and we could not speak too highly of 
his work, : 
Mr. Wharton 8S. Jones gave instruction to the jauior class in 
arithmetic and geography. In arithmetic he took each division, 
and by well-directed recitations carried the class through an ex- 
~ ceedingly profitable review of the subject, and gave many original 
and yaluable methods. Many teachers said that this instruction in 
in arithmetic had been worth months of schooling to them. In 
Geography he emphasized the value of surface maps, and the study 
of the commercial relations of countries. In the senior class Mr. 
Jones gave daily recitations in algebra and geology of Tennessee. 
The intense interest he aroused in these subjects proves how well 
his work was done. 
Mr. S. A. Mynders gave instruction to the juniors in pedagogy, 
psychology (as applied to education), and grammar. The importance 
of a thorough study of correct and forcible English was emphasized 
and the different parts of technical grammar reviewed by actual 
recitations. In the senior class he taught rhetoric, scientific agri- 
culture, physiology and book-keeping. In rhetoric he discussed 
the elements and qualities of style, practical composition and pure 
form, the uses of books and the value of a library, literary topics 
and helps. The work on agriculture and physiology was illus- 
trated. 
Every subject in the primary and secondary school courses re- 
ceived careful attention, as well as the professional work laid down 
in the syllabus. Each instructor bad four recitations a day. 
At the close of the Institute we held a rigid examination on all 
the branches taught. In the senior class twenty-five applied for 
examination, and seventeen succeeded in passing, with the required 
average, 85 per cent., and not less than 65 per cent., on any one~ 
study. To these certificates that their names had been placed on
-P-A-G-E-26
EE gem 
the roll of honor were issued. Public exercises were held for this 
purpose, and able addresses delivered to the class by Dr. Jos. E. 
Martin and Mr. W. P. Robertson, of Jackson. The following is 
a list of successful applicants : 
Miss Virginia Kathleen Seate...........-...6+- Trenton.

    In the junior class ninety-eight applied for examination, of whom 
sixty-nine made the required average, aud were promoted to the 
senior class. 
Notwithstanding the circulars were not issued until ten days be- 
fore time to open, we enrolled 246 teachers, and hed an average 
Gaily attendance of 192. The attendance was regular and prompt. 
Every county in West Tennessee was represented, aud several 
counties sent large delegations. 
We believe this Institute has demonstrated the practicability of 
the plan and the wisdom of the State Superintendent and agent of 
the Peabody Board in establishing them. Great good is being 
done. The teachers that attend return to their respective counties 
and become valuable workers in County Institutes. In this way 
the results are being felt all over the State. 
The people of Jacksou appreciate the importance of this Insti- 
titute, and are greatly interested in it. The local board is ready to 
vender every possible assistance and encouragement. They willingly
-P-A-G-E-27

meet all expenses incurred in arranging buildings, furnishing jani- 
tor, ete. 
Your visit was appreciated, and we can assure you the hearty 
co-operation of the teachers of West Tennessee in your important 
work. 
We recommend that the circulars announcing the opening of the 
next session be issued as early as possible. We believe the attend- 
~ ance another year can be made to double that of this year. 
Respectfully submitted, 
8. A. Mynpers, Tuomas H. Parnes, President. 
Secretary of Faculty. 
AMENDMENTS To Scoot Laws. 
The last Legislature of Tennessee wisely amended our school 
laws: 
1. By prohibiting County Superintendents in counties of 30,000 
or over from teaching in the public schools during their official 
terms, or from taking any contract for building or repairing school 
property, or from becoming the owner of a school warrant, other 
than allowed him for his services as County Superintendent. 
2. By providing that preceding each biennial election for County 
Superintendent of schools each applicant shall file with the Chair- 
mau of the County Court a certificate of qualification to be given 
after an examination of the applicant by a commission of three resi- 
dents of the county, appointed by the Chairman of the County Court, 
and to be held under rules and regulations prescribed by the State 
Board of Edueation. : 
3. By providing that in addition to the branches in which in- 
struction is now given in the public schools of the State, physiology 
and hygiene, with special reference to the nature of alcoholic drinks 
and narcotics, and smoking cigarettes avd their effects upon the 
human system, shall be taught as thoroughly as other required 
branches; and providing further, that afier January 1, 1896, no 
certificate 1o teach in the public schools should be granted to any 
one who does not pass, in a satisfactory manner, an examination in 
physiology and hygiene, with special reference to the effect of alco- 
holic drinks and narcotics and cigarette smoking, upon the human 
system. 
The State Board of Education appointed as a committee to pre-
-P-A-G-E-28
eae fe 
pare rules and regulations governing the examinations of County 
Superintendents, Prof. Frank Goodman, Superintendents Charles 8. 
Douglass and 8. G. Gilbreath. As yet no report has been sub- 
mitted by the committee named. 
To carry into effect the law requiring the teaching of physiology 
and hygiene, with special reference to the nature of alcoholic 
drinks and narcotics and cigarette smoking, and their effects upon 
the human system, the following instructions and regulations were 
issued by the State Superintendent: 
  STATE OF ENNESSES, 
DeEpPARTMENT OF PuBLIC INSTRUCTION 
NasHvILue, TENN., October 1, 1895. 
To County Superintendents : 
To assist you in carrying into execution the law requiring the 
teaching in the public schools of physiology and bygience, with 
special reference to the nature of alcoholic drinks and narcoties and 
cigarette smoking, and their effects upon the human system, the — 
following instructions are given: 
1, At an early date have the directors meet and adopt some text- 
book on the subject. Inform yourselves as to the merits of the va- 
rious texts proposed, and make such suggestions to the directors as 
you may deem advisable. (See School Laws, Section 9, Sub-sec- 
tion 2.) 
2. After January 1, 1896, issue no certificates to applicants who 
do not undergo a satisfactory examination as required in section 3, 
unless they are graduates of reputable colleges or teachers of recog- 
nized ability. 
3. Certificates issued prior to January 1, 1896, are good until 
June 80, 1896, and the holders of the same cannot be required to 
undergo a further examination in physiology and hygiene, ete., but 
they may be required by the directors to give instruction in said 
branch of study after the directors have made an adoption of text- 
books, 
ProposeD AMENDMENTS To THE ScHoon Laws. 
Proposed amendments to the public school laws should be con- 
sidered with all care before final action is taken, and they should 
be approved by teachers and officers familiar with the practical 
workings of the schools before they become laws.
-P-A-G-E-29
  EO 
We have in Tennessee two State Educational Associations, “The 
State Teachers’ Association,” and “The Public School Officers’? As- 
sociation.” These bodies hold annual meetings, are composed of — 
the best school talent in the State, and represent in its entirety our 
public school system. Any changes suggested or amendments pro- 
posed by these bodies should have much weight with our legislators. 
At the meeting of the State Teachers’ Association held in Frank- 
lin, July 30 and 31, and August 1, 1895, President G. R. McGhee 
appointed asa Committee on Amendments to our School Laws the fol- 
lowing representative educators: Capt. ©. S. Douglass, chairman, 
Hon. W. R. Garrett, Capt. 8. A. Mynders, Prof. J. G. Meadows 
and Supt. J. H. Allen. i 
The Public School Officers’ Association, at its meeting held in 
Nashville, December 10, 11 and 12, 1895, elected as a “ Committee 
on Reform in Publie School Laws,” Supt. 8. G. Gilbreath, chair- 
man, ex-Supt. Thomas H. Paine, ex-Supt. Frank M. Smith, ex- 
Supt. W. R. Garrett and Supt. N. D. Overall. 
These committees will meet in joint session and will carefully 
prepare such amendments as they deem essential to the uniformity 
of the system, and will recommend such changes in our laws as they 
consider necessary to extend the usefulness and popularity of our 
public schools, 
The amendments prepared by the joint committee will be sub- 
mitted to the associations for their endorsement, and will then be 
laid before the next General Assembly, with the recommendation 
that they be favorably considered. 
PRorectinc THE ScHoot Funp. 
While the committees above mentioned will suggest. legislation 
needed to protect the school fund, I feel that I should in this report 
call attention to the very unbusiness-like way in which the school 
money is collected and disbursed by the County Trustees and the 
consequent loss to the schools of hundreds of thousands of dol- 
_ Jars annually. 
The school fund should be considered a sacred fund, and all safe- 
guards necessary to protect it should be thrown around it by wise 
legislation. 
I heartily approve the recommendation of Supt. Smith, that “an 
additional clerk be given the Comptroller, whose duty shall be, un- 
der suitable legislation, to look after the collection and disbursement
-P-A-G-E-30
egghs 
   
  of the school fund,” and suggest further that the County Superia- 
tendent should be given authority to audit the books of Trustees, 
and be required to report on their condition to the Comptroller and 
State Superintendent. I beg to call special attention to the urgent 
need of legislation in this matter, and to note the fact that ex-Super- 
intendents Paine, Garrett and Smith in their reports poinied out 
the weakness of the laws governing the finances of our public 
schools. 
      THE CENTENNIAL. 
Next year will be celebrated the one hundreedth anniversary of — 3 
the statehood of Tennessee. This important event will be empha- 
sized by “ The Tennessee Centennial and International Exposition,” 
held in Nashville, beginning September 1, and continuing 100 days. 
Aside from the financial end commercial value of such an exposi- 
tion, it will be a most important factor in the educational develop- 
ment of the State, and by its tendency to incite historical research 
and investigation, will do much to develop State love and State 
pride. We should embrace this opportunity to show to the world 
that while our educational system is not perfect, that it is tending to- 
ward perfection, with the full assurance that our progress, or our lack ee 
of it, is measured, not by the place we now occupy, as by our con- 
tinued growth in the right direction. - ; 
In the Centennial, Dr. William L. Dudley, of Vanderbilt Uni- 
versity, is Chief of the Department of Education, and Prof. W. T. 
Davis is Chief of the Children’s Department. Complete educational 
exhibits will be made in both departments. 
Superintendents, teachers and school officials are taking much in- 
terest in the proposed exhibits, and I can sa ely say that our school 
work, from kindergarten to university, will be represented i a 
ie that will be creditable in every feature.    
  In the Tennessee Centennial and Intervational Exposition the 
educational exhibit ought to be second to no other interest. This 
is the opportunity of a century for our State to show what she is 
doing and can do in both public aad private schools. . Tennessee 
is writing her history in her schools. That history ought to be 
made manifest to the world. It rests with the schools and their 
friends to prepare and furnish such exhibits as shall be of proper 
 
-P-A-G-E-31
Eggs 
educational value to our own people, and at the same time main- 
tain our prestige. 
“Tennessee is the educational center for many States. Hundreds 
of thousands of dollars come to our coffers from this source. We are 
on trial for our position. We must show by whut imperial right 
_ we hold this leadership. It behooves us to do something worthy. 
Those who love their State should feel that this is not only her 
hour of opportunity, but of destiny. The teacher who hesitates to 
enter upon the work of preparing maiter should consider that no 
“more exciting motive can be set before the pupils than that of pre- 
pariug material for public inspection. Dead schools will be unable 
totake part, but in this age of competition those thoroughly alive 
will not shriok from comparison of results with others.”

  In table No. 4 no reports were received from the following coun-

for 1894 are given. 
The increase in the number of school districts is 281—a discour- 
aging increase. 
  
-P-A-G-E-34
Begpe 
In 1893 the number of school districts was 2,710; in 1894 an 
increase of 43 is noted, which is further increased by 231 new dis- 
tricts in 1895. The school district should be identical with the 
civil district, and County Courts should have no power to create 
separate school districts. 
The iocrease in the number of white primary schools is 292; 
white secondary schools 9; a total increase in the number of schools 
of 301, the number of colored schools remaining the same. 
The decrease in the number of teachers employed is 30. The 
number of white male teachers shows a gain of 94, the white fe- 
male teachers a loss of 7, while the total decrease in the number of 
colored teachers employed is 117.

The average number of days taught shows a decrease of 1.7 over 
last year, and the average compensation per month of teachers is 
less by $1.12.

  Tables 9 and 10 show the financial condition of the various 
counties. The tables are not correct, because the books of many 
Trustees are so kept that a correct statement cannot be made. A 
number of the Trustees failed to make financial reports. The bal- 
ance on hand June 30, 1894, was reported to be $638,244.65 (see 
1894 report). The balance on hand for July 1, 1894, as given 
above, is only $617,594.48. The amount received from the State, 
as per the Comptroller’s semi-annual apportionments, was $129,- 
997.25. In the above tables it will be seen that only $122,346.91 is 
reported, 
The scholastic population in 1894 was 708,471. District clerks 
are allowed two cents per capita for making the enumeration. For 
their services therefore they received, in the year named, $14,169.42. 
OF this amount only $12,023.59 is reported. 
Something must be done to protect the school fund.

The cause of education in Tennessee has been materially aided 
by donations from the Peabody Education Fund, and its interests 
much advanced by the wise counsel of the distinguished general 
agent of that fund, Hon. J. L. M. Curry. 
It is with pleasure that I acknowledge my obligations to my 
predecessors in office, Hon. Frank M. Smith, Hon. Thomas H. 
Paine, and Hon. W. R. Garrett, for their kind suggestions and 
advice. 
In this connection, I beg to express my sincere thanks to Prof. 
Frank Goodman for his very acceptable service as Secretary of the 
State Board of Education, Secretary of the State Teachers’ Asso- 
ciation, and Secretary of the Poblic School Officers’ Association, 
and to Capt. C. 8. Douglass and Capt. A. D. Wharton, for their 
efficient work in State Institutes. 
Mr, Walter S. Watts, the clerk of this department, has per- 
formed his work with zeal and efficiency, and is to be commended 
for his faithful attention to duty. 
I beg to assure your Excellency of the high esteem in which 
you are held by the educators of the State, and to express my per- 
sonal gratitude for your uniform kindness and courtesy. 
I have the honor to be your obedient servant, 
8. G. GriprEaTH, 
State Superintendent of Public Instruction.

EXTRACTS FROM ANNUAL REPORTS 
OF 
COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS. 
ANDERSON COUNTY. 
\ W. W. Unperwoop, Superintendent. 
  
Enclosed you will find my annual xepor!. Schools are doing weil 
this year, and we have a contract with the town of Clinton where- 
by a Normal will be maintained for five years. 
BEDFORD COUNTY. 
J. H. ALLen, Superintendent. 
  
Ihave forwarded my statistical report of the public schools of 
Bedford County for the year ending June 30, 1895. 
The school system of the county was never in better condition
-P-A-G-E-102
—101— 
than it has been during the past year. Directors have manifested 
unusual interest in their semiannual meetings. The attendance 
has been good, and the school system is stronger, more efficient and 
better understood, as a result of these meetings. There are no 
“dark corners” in Bedford. Educational advantages are well 
distributed. There ‘are very few children in the county who are 
not within easy reach of a good secondary school. These schools 
are appreciated. They are well managed, well taught and liberally 
patronized. 
Shelbyville is coming to the front with a first-class corporation 
school system. Her public schools will soon compare favorably 
with any in the State. 
We have an excellent corps of teachers. Many of them are 
graduates of good schools of this and other States. Besides being 
competent, they are active and progressive. They read educational 
journals, a number of them have good professional libraries, and 
all give cheerful and liberal support to the annual County Institute. 
Each teacher is a student, and ambitious to prove himself worthy 
of his high calling. 
Our Institute this year, without boasting, was the best teachers’ 
meeting I have ever attended. The teachers were out in full force, 
cheerful and determined. With perfect unity.of feeling and pur- 
pose, all moved to a higher plane of professional excellence. In 
addition to the daily programme of special training, we were ad- 
dressed by Professors J. W. Terrill, of Decherd; W. R. Webb, of 
Bellbuckle; R. A. Clark, of Winchester; Kinneth Morgan, of 
Howell; and Revs. W. C. Clark and R. J. Craig, of Shelbyville, 
and S. G. Thompson, of Farmington. The addresses were appro- 
priate and strong, and contributed much to the interest and value 
of the Institute. Our teachers certainly love the profession better, 
and see their responsibilities clearer, besides being in other respects 
better fitted for the great work before them. 
Thecolored Teachers’ Institute was in session ten days. It was 
well attended, and satisfactory in the character of work done. 
They have improved rapidly, and will soon be fully competent for 
the work before them. y

BENTON COUNTY. 
T. Wrrr Curr, Superintendent. 
It is with the greatest pleasure that I submit to you my first an- 
uual report. I am proud to say that the interest manifested in all 
our educational meetings has been good. Nearly all the schools in 
the county are graded, and I think all will be next year. School 
directors and patrons are taking a greater interest in education than 
formerly. We bave got a good lot of teachers; most of them being 
young men and women who are abreast of the times, and usually 
give satisfaction. The Institute which was held at Camden in 
June was a pronounced success. There were more teachers present 
than ever before in this county. I must acknowledge my thanks 
_to Dr. J. H. Harper, Prof. J. W. Bramager, Prof. O. P. Lashlee, 
as well as many others, for helping to make the Institute what it 
was, “a success.” 
We have organized a Teachers’ Association, which meets every 
month or two in different parts of the county, and the teachers at- 
tend very well. In short, I will say that I think education is ad- 
vancing in this county. 
BRADLEY COUNTY. 
J. I. Harrison, Superintendent. 
I herewith submit my third annual report of the schools of Brad- 
ley County for the year ending June 30, 1895. The schools of this 
county are in good condition, and the teachers are doing better work 
than ever before. We have six secondary schools in the county, 
which are doing much good.
-P-A-G-E-104

‘ CAMPBELL COUNTY. 
Miss Rurua B. Davis, Superintendent. 
I herewith submit my third annual report. I have worked with 
new zeal and courage, and think my report nearly correct. 
Our schools have been better, in many respects, than last year. 
The people of Campbell County are on an educational boom. We 
had a five-days’ Normal at Jacksboro, beginning on the 8th of 
July and continuing to 13th, conducted by L. 8. London, of Knox- 
ville. We still reap the harvest of the good seed sown by Prof. 
London. One hundred teachers present, and many spectators also. 
‘We organized a Teachers’ Association, and meet every three weeks 
in different parts of the county. We have a nicely-printed pro- 
gramme for each meeting, which is distributed to all teachers. We 
have a large crowd at these meetings, and much good is being 
done. The patrons and directors co-operate with us in this grand 
work. 
I have visited most all my schools once, and some twice, and will 
still continue to visit until they close. I can boast of the good 
work being done by my true, faithful teachers. I can boast of the 
interest being taken by all connected with this work. 
As you see, our school terms have been very short for two years, 
on account of money. We need money enough to run a five- 
months’ school ; then we will feel that we are not behind. 
God forbid that Campbell County shall ever be visited by the 
chart agent, as of this year, which at least takes $1,500.00 out of 
our school fund. This is a grand swindle placed on our directors. 
I feel that a brighter day is dawning, and that Campbell will 
move on to progress. : 
I have enjoyed my three years’ superintendence in full measure.

CARROLL COUNTY. 
Mrs. Arpis McKinney Hurpie, Superintendent. 
Enclosed find annual report of Superintendent of Carroll 
County. 
Sickness, and negligence on the part of the Directors, is the 
cause of delay. 
This report is as full as could be ascertained from Directors’ re- 
ports. 
It is a lamentable fact, and I am sorry to say it of our county, 
but there are some districts that have not a competent man who 
will serve as direetur, and of course some of the reports are very 
incomplete. The numbers I have left blank were not reported. 
I trust this report will suffice, as I have found it so hard to har- 
monize it. 
CARTER COUNTY. 
R. M. Cass, Superintendent. 
  
The enclosed report is as accurate as I could make it from the 
information at hand. , 
Since June 30th, 1895, I have held one County Normal at Mil- 
ligan College, which continued in session two weeks and was a 
marked success; also, two Teachers’ Institutes of two days each, 
which were well attended. 
I have visited about all the schools in the county, and find them 
doing good work. ; 
The educational outlook in the county was never better.
-P-A-G-E-106
—105— 
CHESTER COUNTY. 
Miss Harriz Massenciin, Superintendent. 
  
I herewith submit my first annual report, and am glad to say 
that most of our schools are in good working condition. 
We have no library or reading circle, but have a well-organized 
Institute in which the teachers arid citizens are manifesting a great 
interest. 
COFFEE COUNTY. ... 
C. L. Puriuips, Superintendent. 
At the last moment I send you my report. It is, as you will 
see, not complete. I have been unable to get full reports from the 
clerks, and many of the teachers last fall did not send in their ab- 
stracts. This being my first year I could not anticipate these short- 
comings. 
_ I will write you further of our school interests in Coffee County. 
CROCKETT COUNTY. 
J. R. McoDonap, Superintendent. 
Lenclose my annual report, which I hope will reach you in time 
to answer all necessary purposes. 
Our schools are gradually growing better. I feel satisfied that 
we have the best teaching that we have ever had. A few yearsjago 
the teachers were very poorly qualified as to the branches. Of
-P-A-G-E-107
106" 
course no system of methods can be successfully used until the 
teachers are well up in the text-books. Iam glad to say that most 
of our teachers are now able to study, apply and succeed with the 
best methods. 
We have some excellent frame school buildings in our county. 
We are anxious to have the districts all supplied with good houses, 
well furnished, and ther we can use our money in the payment of 
teachers and have longer terms. 
CUMBERLAND COUNTY. 
S. C. Brown, Superintendent. 
I herewith submit to you my third annual report. In doing so 
I am pleased to note progress in the work. Our teachers have im- 
proved very much during the last few years. Our county is well 
up on all the progressive and modern educational thought. 
I held a five-days’ County Institute the third week in June, 
which was well attended. Much interest was manifested. During 
this fall’s work only two Saturdays passed without a teachers’ Insti- 
tute and educational mass meeting being held somewhere in the 
county. These meetings have been very productive in moulding 
public sentiment for the cause. 
Cumberland is doing her share of the educational work of the 
State. 
DAVIDSON COUNTY. 
A. H. Wrieut, Superintendent. 
I herewith submit my third snnual report of Davidson County.
-P-A-G-E-108
—107— 
Tucreased interest on the part of both teachers and directors has 
been manifested. Most of our teachers are well qualified, and are 
doing fine work. The greatest trouble is in irregular attendance. 
While I have reasons to be proud of the schools of Davidson 
County, yet I feel that there is a great deal to be done, for our en- 
rolJment is only 52 per cent. of the scholastic: population. 
We have a teachers’ meeting once a month, which I think is 
doing more to interest the teachers, and through them the people, 
than anything else. A teacher who has not interest enough in his 
work to attend the county Institute is teaching for revenue only, 
‘and never will be successful ; hence should be excluded from teach- 
ing by the school offie:rs. 
DECATUR COUNTY. 
W. H. H. McMinnan, Superintendent. 
T herewith submit my annual report of the County Superintedent 
of Decatur County for the year ending June 30,1895. It is as 
nearly correct as I can make it from the statistics before me. I 
think that the interest in education in this county is gradually 
growing, although it is far below what it should be. 
We have some very good teachers in the public school work of 
this county, and we also have several young teachers who are not 
very well qualified for their important work. There is a great lack 
of interest with nearly all our teachers in Institute work. They 
complain that their salaries are so small, and that their school terms 
are so short, that they caunot «afford to lose the time and bear the 
necessary expense of attending Institutes. One of the greatest ob- 
stacles in the way of progress in our schools is lack of funds. 
Onr county is small and our people generally are poor, and hence 
the outlook for great educutional progress and advancement is not 
as bright as I would like to see it. I think, however, that under 
all the circumstances we are doing reasonably well in that direction.
-P-A-G-E-109
S218 
In the item of school-houses my report is not as large as it was last 
year, but I think that is owing to its being nearer correct. Many 
of our schools are taught in churches. In several of the school dis- 
tricts the people have built houses for church and school purposes. 
In nearly all such cases the right of the property is in the church, 
and I have left the estimates out of my report. Sickness has pre- 
vented me from visiting a good many of the schools, and has also 
caused some delay in my report. Ihave organized a Directors’ As- 
sociation, which meets on the last Saturday in July. I think that 
if the organization is kept up that it will do some good in the way 
of getting reports more promptly. 
If the Legislature could be induced to make the school district 
and the civil district identical, I think we might have better schools, 
longer terms and more satisfactory reports. 
DEKALB COUNTY. 
W. J. Gornarn, Superintendent. 
I send to you my report of the public schools of DeKalb 
County. Idid not have any record of ex-Supt. Brown to go by, 
and I went to him in person and got the facts as best Icould. Dm 
going to urge directors and teachers to make me all reports required 
by law, so next year I can make youa good report. 
DICKSON COUNTY. 
Mrs. AcNnes Surpp, Superintendent. 
I herewith enclose my annual report for the year ending June 30, 
1895. Iam proud to say that we are making some progress in the
-P-A-G-E-110
—109— 
educational cause. The schools of Dickson County are improving. 
The teachers are more interested in the Institute work than they 
have been heretofore. I have held five Institutes this year. The 
attendance was very good. 
I have visited all the schools in our county. I enjoy my work 
splendidly, and I think all County Superintendents should visit 
their schools. 
I hope to be able to give you a correct report next year. I will 
have my district directors send in their reports to me according to 
law. 
FENTRESS COUNTY. 
Eien Wriaur, Superintendent. 
I herewith submit my first annual report for the year ending 
June 80, 1895. The report is far from being satisfactory, owing to 
imperfect report of Directors. I think, on the whole, that our 
county is coming to the front right along, and I am doing every- 
thing in my power to advance the educational interest all over the 
county. 
Our County Institute, held in Jamestown, was well attended ; 
conducted by Prof. Case, of Rugby, and was very profitable. 
GRAINGER COUNTY. 
W. T. Purnrips, Superintendent. 
I herewith forward you my annual report for the year ending 
June 30, 1895. I have had difficulties to contend with in getting
-P-A-G-E-111
—110— 
it up. Some districts have not reported yet. So it is not full and 
complete, but the best I could do under the circumstances. 
I was elected to the office of Superintendent in 1893, but the of- 
fice was withheld—a contest gone into that lasted during the entire 
term, until my re-election—before I came into possession. 
I have endeavored to do my duty as best I could under the cir- 
cumstances that have beset me—a small salary, tardy officers, 
meagre funds, etc. 
I have visited over half of the schools in the county, and have 
found good work in ninety-five per cent. of them. But funds be- 
ing short, and, under our present system, teachers having to wait so 
long before pay-day, and, perhaps, at Jast have to shave their war- 
ants ten per cent., our best ones have left us and gone to new fields. 
In Institute work we bave had fine crowds. The public is inter- 
ested as never before. The attendance on the part of the teachers has 
been good. The public has attended and brought out well-filled 
baskets at each meeting. We discuss in these meetings all the dif- 
ferent phases of the school question. Our per capita this year is 
only $1.02. Our Teachers’ Association will meet Saturday, Octo- 
ber 19, its last meeting for the year. 
We had in Grainger County this year one of the most interesting 
Normals that has ever been held in the county. In June I pub- 
lished an outline of the programme. I secured the services of two 
able educators to assist me—Prof. J. T. Henderson, Superintendent 
of Loudon County, and Prof. James E. Caldwell. We had lectures 
from Dr. Spence, of Harriman Temperance University, on ‘ Intel- 
ligence Born of Leadership ;” Dr. W. J. Heacker, on “ Physiology 
and Hygiene;” Prof. H. M. Sherwood, on “ The Old and New.” 
I must thank Misses Gilmore, Brown and Line for the fine 
music furnished. 
It was a pleasure for me to become a member of East Tennessee 
Educational Association during its meeting at Morristown. 
I know that the educational sky of old Grainger is brightening. 
The winds of progress are blowing the clouds of ignorance and
-P-A-G-E-112
—l1ll— 
gloom away. It will not be long till we shall have clear sailing, and 
then, God grant that we may be the equal of any county in proud 
old Tennessee, second to none, « banner county in educational 
progress. 
GILES COUNTY. 
J. T. Crossno, Superintendent. 
I herewith submit my annual report of the common schools of 
Giles County for the year beginning July 1, 1894, and ending June 
30, 1895. 
The schools are doing as well as they can under the cireum- 
stances. Redistricting the county, with seventy-two school districts, 
has caused no end of confusion. Our county levy is only ten cents 
on the $100. We asked the County Court, at its July term, for an 
increase of five cents, making the county levy equal the State for 
school purposes, and came within a few votes of getting the levy 
raised. 
Our Teachers’ Library has proven quite a help to the teachers. 
Our monthly meetings are very interesting. 
From June 17 to July 1 I held a Normal Institute at Martin 
College, Pulaski, with about 150 teachers in attendance. The 
teachers were very attentive and enthusiastic. The Institute was 
quite a departure from the old-time Institutes. Forty minutes were 
allowed for talks on pedagogics, forty minutes for vocal music, aad 
the remainder of each day was devoted to regular class work under 
competent teachers. Much good resulted from the two weeks’ 
work. Those deserving especial mention are EK. R. Eldridge, LL. 
D., Troy, Ala.; Dr. J. E. Bailey, Nashville; Mrs. Flournoy Riy- 
ers and W. E. Lumley, of Pulaski. 
IT have organized a Directors’ Association, to meet semi-annually. 
Our first meeting was largely attended, and the directors present
-P-A-G-E-113
—11l2— 
manifested great interest in the schools and the bettering of the 
school system. 
GIBSON COUNTY. 
Miss Frora FrrzGerAuD, Superintendent. 
After I mailed my annual report to you, I find that I left out 
some important notes that I intended to send; so I make mention 
of them now. Gibson County is making rapid progress in the 
educational field. We have a uniform system of text-books, and 
all our schools are graded, with the exception of a few, where the 
sessions are so short that teachers find it impossible to establish 
gradation. Our County Court failed to make an appropriation for 
conducting a summer Normal this year, but Gibson County teach- 
ers are too progressive, and feel too much interest in the educational 
advancement of their county, to allow her to fall behind. They 
rallied to my assistance, and we had our summer Normal as usual. 
The third week in June I held an Institute for colored teachers. 
This was conducted by local talent, and was well attended. The 
character of work done by the colored teachers was truly gratify- 
ing. At the examination held at the close of the Institute several 
obtained first-grade certificates. The last week in June we held an 
Institute for white teachers, and I take pride in saying that this 
was pronounced by all who attended one of the most successful and 
profitable meetings Gibson County has ever had. In this work I 
was aided by Misses W. A. Muse, of Rutherford Station, and R. 
E. Goldsby, of Milan, two successful and enthusiastic teachers and 
Institute conductors of this county; also Messrs. J. W. Meadows, 
J. C. Wright, E, M. Fitzgerald, J. B. Cummins, Misses Sallie 
Blakemore and Mattie Butler, and Mrs. S. V McGee, all prominent 
teachers of this county. We enrolled eighty teachers the first 
morning, and the second day our enrollment reached 135. Among 
the prominent visitors at our Institute, we meution Captain C. 8. 
Douglass, of Gallatin; Dr. J. L. Dickens, President of McKenzie 
College; and A. W. Minter, of Waverly Training School. [ be-

lieve every teacher in the county who expected to teach was in 
attendance at the Institute. At the close of the meeting teachers 
expressed themselves as being well pleased, and feeling better 
equipped for the work before them. We have a Teachers’ Circu- 
lating Library Association, and every teacher in the county must 
be a member. Our Teachers’ Association meets monthly. We 
hope to have a Normal of one month’s duration next year. 
GREENE COUNTY. 
J. H. Lovr, Superintendent. 
I herewith send you my first annual report as Superintendent of 
Greene County, which I hope will meet your approbation. 
Tam a little late, owing to circumstances unavoidable to myself 
and a failure on the part of the trustee to hand in his report. 
The schools of this county are doing fairly well, though there is 
plenty of room for improvement. 
We have near an hundred good commodious school houses, all of 
which have blackboards; some have charts and maps, and quite a 
number have good patent desks. 
Lhave visited quite a number of schools this year, and I find 
teachers doing good work and patrons well pleased. 
Our annual Institute this year was a decided success. Prof. R. 
M. Alexander, of Tusculum, was the conductor. We enrolled 127 
teachers. Much interest was masifested by the teachers as well as 
by the visitors.

GRUNDY COUNTY. 
L. V. WooptEE, Superintendent. 
I herewith submit you my fifth annual report of the schools of 
Grundy County, ending June 380, 1895. 
In most of my former reports I have spoken favorably of the 
schools and educational interests of said county ; and in that respect 
this will be similar to my other reports, except to emphasize the 
remark that the educational interest here is better than ever before. 
This is evident from the increased enrollment in the schools this 
year over the corresponding period last year; and the per cent. of 
attendance, while not entirely satisfactory, is in every respect en- 
couraging. 
I have visited most all of the schools. In my visitations I en- 
deavored to note the general condition of the houses, grounds, fur- 
niture and apparatus ; the order, classification, interest and facilities. 
for work in the schools, and the methods of instruction and dis- 
cipline on the partof teachers. Such words of encouragement were 
spoken to the pupils, and such suggestions were given to teachers, 
as the circumstances in each case seemed to warrant. 
I would not forget to mention the fact that Shook College, in 
this county, built and donated to the children here by that noble 
and generous-hearted Col. A. M. Shook, at an expense of nearly 
$40,000, although in its infancy, is not now surpassed by any other 
school in the State. With a very fine faculty, headed with W. G. 
Dillon as its principal, it bids fair to soon rank in character among 
the foremost institutions in this country. My report is as accurate 
as it is possible to make it. 
HARDEMAN COUNTY. 
I. N. Rotanp, Superintendent. 
Enclosed you will please find my annual report. 
It is not correct. I hope to have it better in the future.

HARDIN COUNTY. 
Z. J. Tompson, Superintendent. 
Enclosed please find my first report of the public schools of Har- 
din County. 
On account of the carelessness of most of the directors and quite 
a number of the teachers in sending in their reports, my report is 
not as accurate as I would wish it to be, but think now, from the 
outlook, that next year I will be better prepared. 
I made a tour of the county during August, and found the 
schools in much better condition than I expected. The educational 
interest in Hardin County is improving. The teachers are be- 
coming more enthusiastic. I hope to report more favorably next 
year. : 
HAWKINS COUNTY. 
L. L. Livesay, Superintendent. 
I herewith submit my annual report, showing the condition of 
the schools of Hawkins County. I must confess that there is a 
great deal of guess work in the report, as my predecessor had no 
record from which I could draw information. The directors have 
been rather backward in making their reports, claiming that their 
predecessors had left no record of anything that they had done. 
On entering upon the duties of my office I found no record of any 
kind showing anything that had been done during the past four 
years. 
I shall call the Annual Association to meet in November, and 
shall endeavor to organize a County Association, which shall be 
tributary to the East Tennessee Teachers’ Associ ition.
-P-A-G-E-117
—116— 
This year I held four Normals, at four different points in the 
county, for the convenience of the teachers. At each of these I 
employed from one to four good teachers to conduct the Normal. 
Each Normal proved to be a success, and were well and largely at- 
tended by the teachers of not only the locality which they were in- 
tended to accommodate, but by the teachers of the various localities 
of the county. Some of the teachers attended all the Normals of 
‘the county. During each one of these Normals a part of the time 
was taken up in the examination of applicants for certificates. So 
we opened up our schools this year under very favorable circum- 
stances, except in a very few instances. We have had no friction 
whatever in any of the communities where Normals were held. We 
can see marked improvements in the schools of the county. The 
directors had more material from which to select their teachers 
than ever before in the history of the county, there being more: 
teachers examined than ever before. One hundred and seventy-six 
certificates have been issued this year. Our directors held a meet- 
ing on the 7th day of May last and passed a resolution to promise 
no school until after the Normals closed, which, in my opinion, 
brought out numbers of teachers that would not otherwise have at- 
tended. Nearly all the schools of the county now are tolerably well 
graded. 
HENRY COUNTY. 
J. 8, Rouren, Superintendent. 
Enclosed herewith please find my report for the year ending 
June 50,1895. It is not as accurate as it should be, owing to some 
of the clerks failing to make reports. 
I send you a manual and course of study for the schools of Henry 
county.

—1l7— 
HOUSTON COUNTY. 
W. H. Boone, Superintendent. 
Enclosed please find my first annual report for the year ending 
June 30, 1895. I am proud to say that old Houston County is 
taking a great interest in education. Our County Court, by being 
liberal in its appropriations to the school fund, has placed itself on 
record asa special friend to education and higher grade teachers. 
We have been making a strong effort to grade our schools, and, 
to a great extent, we have succeeded. About 60 per cent. of our 
teachers take educational journals. 
I conducted a three-day Institute at Erin this summer, which 
was attended by 90 per cent. of the teachers. We have organized 
an educational association, which meets once in each month, and I 
am proud to say all our teachers have been attending it, except 
three, 
Lhave made it a point to visit every school in the county, and I 
find that our teachers are taking a great interest in their work. 
Our directors do not manifest the interest they should in sending 
in their reports, hence the delay on my part. 
HUMPHREYS COUNTY. 
A. B. Srpson, Supeintendent. 
I herewith submit my first annual report of the schools of Hum- 
phreys County: 
Two years ago the County Court reduced the salary of the Couaty 
Superintendent to $150, and gave him instructions that so far as 
carrying out the law was concerned he need give himself uo trouble.
-P-A-G-E-119
—118— 
Schools were not visited, Institutes were not held, teachers’ ab- 
stract, monthly reports, and even directors’ reports, were not made. 
Examination of teachers was reduced to a minimum, and renewals, 
duplications and permiscuous issuing of certificates flooded our 
county with incompetent teachers. The public treasury was drained 
for kindred and friends, at the expense of the improvement of our 
schools. Disgust and dissatisfaction pervaded the couuty, and many 
expressed a desire to have the money appropriated for other pur- 
- poses. 
Becoming Superintendent in January, I found that no record had 
been kept for two years, and that from the fifty-two districts and 
seventy schools I had but eleven teachers’ abstracts from which to 
make my report. 
I organized a Teachers’ Institute in January, and to date have 
held fourteen, with a fair attendance and some few taking interest 
in the work. 
Mr. W. E. Miller, of the Southern Methodist Institute, and my- 
self taught a summer Normal for four weeks in June, which was a 
great benefit to the teachers. We evrolled but twenty-nine teachers. 
Early in the year £ gave notice that no certificate would be dupli- 
cated or renewed, and that the examinations would be strict and 
much more rigid than heretofore. Dates and results of examina- 
tions were as follows: June 28, seventy-three applicants, twenty- 
four failures ; July 9, twenty applicants, eighteen failures; July 25, 
forty-three applicants, twenty-six failures ; August 1, thirteen appli- 
cants, twelve failures; August 23, twelve applicants, five failures. 
Out of the 161 applicants I have licensed seventy-six teachers, and 
I feel that they are doing reasonably good work. They are by far 
the ablest corps of teachers the county has ever had. All eyes are 
upon them, and a general interest seems to be awakening, and, with 
the encouragement I am able to give them when I visit their 
schools, the inspiration they gather from the Institutes, and the 
stimulus that the next examination will cull out the incompetent, 
lend hope and encouragement to the school work of old Humphreys. 
My report is as nearly correct as I am able to get ; for, after visit- 
ing nearly all the districts in July and August, I have been able to
-P-A-G-E-120
QE 
receive reports from but thirty-seven out of fifty-three districts. AJl 
sent reports of scholastic population but two; but the general report 
some could not make out at all ; others made but partially, and yet 
others have never replied to my letters insisting upon their making 
the report. 
JACKSON COUNTY. 
L. D. Jounson, Superintendent. 
Enclosed you will find my third annual report of the public 
schools of Jackson County. You will find, by referring to said re- 
port, that there is a considerable increase in the scholastic popu- 
lation of our county; also, enrollment and attendance, and av- 
erage daily attendance, which is shown by the per cent. of attend- 
ance, which is 75 per cent. for the whole term. This is due to the 
increased interest of both teachers and directors. 
A majority of our teachers, since the 85 per cent. of grade came 
out, have been working hard to improve themselves by going to 
school, going to Normals, Teachers’ Institutes, and studying at 
home ; also, by reading standard educational journals. Much in- 
terest was manifested by both teachers—some directors—and citi- 
zens in our Institutes, held first at Clenny, conducted by the super- 
intendent of the county, second at Gainsboro, conducted by Prof. 
W. L. Dixon, of Lebanon University. We had a good time in- 
deed. Conductor Dixon said that he was well pleased with the 
work of the various committees on the various subjects. 
Now, we kaow that education is on an advance in this county, 
despite all the conflicting circumstances, the principal of which are 
these: 1. Part of teachers’ salaries has to be paid out of this year’s 
taxes, compelling them to have to wait, instead of running on a cash 
basis. 2. Squandering of funds that no one seemingly can account 
for, for instance, defaleation of ex-Trustees. But we still have 
enough money to run something like four months, on an average.
-P-A-G-E-121
—120— 
We visit all our schools from time to time, as the law directs, 
consulting and advising with both teachers and directors, and lec- 
turing students and patrons where they can be got out. Never 
teaching while public schools are in session. 
JOHNSON COUNTY. 
R. L. Nave, Superintendent. 
I herewith submit my first annual report—a report for the scho- 
lastic year ending June 30, 1895. 
Our schools are in excellent condition; attendance good, and our 
teachers giving satisfaction. 
Our Institute, conducted by Prof. John W. Hydeu, of Hampden- 
Sidney school, Knoxville, was 2 success. It is said that there were 
more visitors attending the Institute than have ever attended one in 
this county. The teachers seem to be in the work this year. Fifty- 
two teachers were enrolled ; fifty-five were in daily attendance. 
KNOX COUNTY. 
J. C. Forp, Superintendent. 
I herewith submit this my seventi annual report of the publi¢ 
schools of Knox County. While the educational system of Knox 
County is not perfect, and there is still considerable room for im- 
provement, yet a great work is being done towards the education 
of the masses. There has been in the last few years a marked im- 
provement in the instruction given in our schools. The teachers 
are better preparing themselves for their work every year. They
-P-A-G-E-122
—121— 
are acquiring a broader and deeper information along educational 
lines. This is due, largely, to our efficient summer Normal Insti- 
tutes, and an extensive reading by the teachers from the county 
library. 
The library is a source of much information for those who are 
interested in educational topics. It has become such a fixture in 
our educational system that the work would be seriously impaired 
without it. Many volumes are being added every year to the li- 
brary list. 
We have just completed a catalogue of the library, in which the 
books have been classified under the following departments : 
Pedagogy and Psychology, History and Travels, Stories, Biog- 
raphy, Science and Literature, Fiction and Miscellaneous. The 
catalogue is so arranged that it can be ascertained at a glance what 
books are in the library. 
The Knox County Teachers’ Institute met, in connection with 
the Peabody Normal Institute, at the Girls’ High School, in Kuox- 
ville, on the first day of July, 1895, lasting three weeks. The 
Faculty of the Institute was composed of Prof. A. D. Wharton, 
Nashville, Tenn., Prof. John McCallie, Principal of Mechanics- 
ville School, and J.C. Ford. The Institute was largely attended, 
there being more than two hundred teachers present. 
We have held twenty educational mass meetings in the various 
districts of the county during the year. These meetings were well 
attended by the patrons of the schools; and, by reason of such 
meetings, much good has been accomplished, as teacher and patrons 
are brought together, thereby creating a greater sympathy with 
each other. 
The subjects of good citizenship, patriotism, love of country, 
respect for law and order, are being given more attention in the ed- 
ucational work of Knox County than ever before. Indeed, we re- 
gard this as being of great importance, and should have an im- 
portant place in the education of the children of our land. Too 
much have these subjects been neglected, and we desire to impress 
the importance of them, not only upon the minds of the teachers,
-P-A-G-E-123
—122— 
but upon the minds of the school officers and patrons; for we be- 
lieve that crime and criminal prosecution will not be lessened until 
these principles are instilled in the minds of the young and rising 
generation, and the place to do this is undoubtedly within the 
province of our system of public education. 
In view of the coming Tennessee Centennial Exposition, the 
public schools of Knox County are preparing to make an educational 
exhibit of the growth and progress of the public school system of 
the county. We do not feel that we can allow this opportunity to 
pass without taking advantage of the same. It is not necessary in 
this report to give anything like the details of our work in this 
respect. Suffice to say that Knox County will make an educational 
exhibit that will be second to none in the great commonwealth of 
Tennessee. 
In taking the scholastic population we enumerated the entire 
census of the county by districts. The scholastic population of 
Knox County is as follows: 
White male, 10,060; white female, 9,945 ; colored male, 2,220; 
colored female, 2,731; total white, 20,005; total colored, 4,951 ; 
grand total, 24,956. The entire census of Knoxville is 30,512 ; 
North Knoxville, 2,932 ; West Knoxville, 3,103; the county dis- 
tricts, 36,323. The entire census of Knox County is 72,870. 
The Trustee’s report shows amount on hand July 1, 1894, $21,- 
924.31. Amount received from State, $4,496.45. Amount received 
from county, $84,513.79. Total amount received, $110,943.63.

LAKE COUNTY. 
J. H. C. Hurcuison, Superintendent. 
I this day submit to you my first annual report. We have had 
about twenty schools in session for nearly four months on an aver- 
age, with fairly good teachers in charge. The children attending 
have made for the most part, I think, commendable progress, but 
the length of time the schools can be kept in operation is too short. 
Lake County does as well in this respect as a large majority of the 
counties of the State, but more funds are needed, and the schools in 
every district should be kept open at least five months. I have 
done what I could to advance the school interests of our county, 
and also to make my report as complete as possible. 
LAUDERDALE COUNTY. 
Mrs. L. A. Warxins, Superintendent. 
In submitting my annual report I am pleased to state that our 
schools are steadily improving and we are having a better and more 
interested class of teachers. We had during one week in June one 
of the most delightful and instructive Institutes which it has ever 
been the privilage of our teachers to attend. And be it said in their 
honor, that the expense of the same was borne by themselves en- 
tirely, with the exception of one dollar contributed by the cireuit 
court clerk. The Institute was conducted by Prof. W. A. Muse, of 
Rutherford, Tenn., of whom I cannot speak too highly as a teacher, 
gentleman and successful Institute worker. We have a teachers’ 
organization which was meeting very regularly before the free 
schools began in July. But since I became so very much engaged 
visiling schools have only held one or two meetings. You will see 
from my report that I have issued more certificates than applicants
-P-A-G-E-125
Sega 
examined. We h»ve a number of experienced and successful teach- 
ers to whom TF issue certificates without examination, in compliance 
with the rulings of your predecessors. 
LAWRENCE COUNTY. 
J. P. Rippry, Superintendent. 
The accompanying report for the school year ending June 30, 
1895, is as near correct as can be made, on account of the former 
County Superintendent of Lawrence County leaving the county be- 
fore the schools closed their annual session, and the teachers failed 
to make their reports to the directors until I was elected to fill the 
place of County Superintendent—January, 1895. When I called 
for the annual reports of the teachers and directors they could not 
be had, and neither could a record of the former Superintendent’s 
word be had, consequently I had to make my report under such 
circumstances as would not permit a correct report in every partic- 
ular. 
LEW1S COUNTY. 
Baski Hensiey, Superinfendent. 
I herewith send my annual report, which is as accurate as can be 
made under the circumstances. 
I desire to say that the educational interest of Lewis County is 
steadily growing; teachers are more alive and seem to realize the 
importance of their work. These and other things are unmistak- 
able evidence of a brighter future for our schools.
-P-A-G-E-126
—125— 
LOUDON COUNTY. 
Joun T, Henperson, Superintendent.. 
Our schools are improving slowly, but surely. We have built six 
good frame houses within the past four years. We have organizeda 
teachers’ library, and have been making the examinations of 
teachers more rigid gradually. I think we are ina fair way to 
make improvement within the next few years. 
MADISON COUNTY. 
C. P. Lowe, Superintendent. 
In submitting my first annual report of course it would be im- 
possible for me to determine whether there had been any improve- 
ment last year or not, but I wish to say that I have visited nearly 
every school in the county, and have pressed the importance of 
having better schools, and, as the first step in that direction, to 
grade the schools. Soon after coming into office, in June last, I 
had published a “ Manual for the schools of Madison County,” set- 
ting out the grades, adopted books and other points of interest to 
the schools. I found, in visiting the schools of the county since, _ 
that nearly ever teacher was trying, if they had not succeeded in 
grading the schools; so I cannot furnish a complete report as to 
the grades, but I can safely say that more than half of the schools 
have been well graded, and by next year I trust that I shall be able 
to report in full on that subject. 
The State Institute, which was conducted here, beginning June’ — 
17, and lasting a month, was quite a success ; teachers were in at- 
tendance from all over West Tennessee. Our teachers from this 
county attended very well, and much better than the year previous, 
and if I can influence more of them to attend next year I shall
-P-A-G-E-127
—126 — 
certainly do so, for the teachers of our county must keep up with 
the procession. 
MARSHALL COUNTY. 
J. G. Srixson, Superintendent. 
I herewith submit my first annual report of the schools of Mar- 
shall County. I failed to find much to make my report from, as @ 
great many teachers failed to make any report of their work to the 
clerks of the districts. I have visited many of the clerks who 
had not a “scratch of a pen” to show what had been done in their 
districts; also I found but little in my office to help me make a 
report ; but I promise you one thing, that there will be a change in 
the affairs of my county, and next year I am going to have a correct 
report at all hazards. 
McMINN COUNTY. 
M. R. M. Burke, Superintendent. 
Enclosed find my first annual report of the schools of my county. 
We are looking after the needs of our schools and becoming ac- 
quainted with their wants, and are laying a foundation on which to 
build. 
We had some excellent Normals this year, and have monthly In- 
stitutes which are well attended. 
We hope to have an increase along all lines during the year to 
come.

MEIGS COUNTY. 
A. GALLAHER, Superintendent. 
Excuse me for being late in making my report. The directors 
were slow in reporting to me. Our schools this year are short on 
account of funds. 
A County Institute was held in Decatur, July 8 to 13. Sixty- 
two teachers were enrolled. The meeting was very profitable to the 
teachers, 
The majority of the teachers are now reading good educational 
journals. Our teachers meet once each month. These meetings 
are well attended by the public. 
MORGAN COUNTY. 
R. B. Honeyourr, Superintendent. 
I herewith submit my annual report for the year ending June 30, 
1895, which is as nearly perfect as may be made from the data at 
hand. Directors will not make full reports, and I am therefore 
compelled to resort to such other means of information as can be 
obtained. 
The schools of Morgan County are, for the most part, in a pros- 
perous condition. I held a three weeks’ Normal during the month 
of June, which was well attended, and the results very satisfactory. 
I am endeavoring to remove what I have considered to be an 
obstacle in the way of education in my county by granting certifi- 
cates only to such teachers as are thoroughly qualified to teach. 
As a result, I feel safe in predicting we will have better schools 
this year than ever before.
-P-A-G-E-129
- —128— 
We are, however, confronted by two of the same enemies of edu- 
cation here that are to be found in nearly all the counties of Eust 
‘Tennessee. I mean “ backless seats” and the “chart fiend.” The 
latter has relieved us of some $800 this year, which amount, to- 
gether with the expense of useless lawsuits, has forced the suspen- 
sion of five schools of the county. 
I have as yet visited few schools, but intend to visit them all. 
It is my opinion that County Superintendents can make themselves 
more useful to the cause of education by spending their time with 
teachers who are at work in their respective schools than by hold- 
ing Institutes of one day’s duration, from time to time, over the 
county. 
MONROE COUNTY. 
SAMUEL J. Parks, Superintendent. 
I herewith submit my first annual report. The enrollment by 
grades und studies is carefully estimated from the fifty-two ab- 
stracts that I have on hand. 
So far as I can ascertain the Trustee’s report is very near correct. 
The chairman of the County Court reports the balance due from 
last year at $3,400. Judge Montgomery reports it at $3.100. 
The two Normals that I held this year were both a success. I 
am holding monthly Institutes this fall with reasonable attendance. 
OBION COUNTY. 
James H. Jackson, Superintendent. 
I herewith have the honor to submit this, my fourth annual re-
-P-A-G-E-130
—129— 
port, in which I am glad it can be truthfully stated that our schools 
are in a more prosperous condition than ever before. Since my 
last annual report the course of study for this county has been re- 
vised, and about seven hundred copies printed and distributed 
among the teachers and school officers. We now have 112 volumes 
in our library for the white teachers, and every teacher in the 
county is a member of it. Many of our teachers are reading regu- 
larly. There are two monthly Associations, white and colored, 
which continue from September to June. We have also organized 
a library for our colored teachers, and all of our colored teachers 
are members. Many of the new members of our County Court 
placed themselves on record in favor of better schools, by appro- 
priating $150 for Institute purposes. The colored Institute was 
again conducted by Prof. Thomas McMakin, of the Union City 
Graded School. The attendance was larger and interest better 
than at any former Institute. 
Hon. Frank M. Smith located one of the Peabody Institutes at. 
Union City, and gave us as conductor Capt. ©. S. Douglass, of Gal- 
latin, Tenn., and Miss Mary E. Duvall, of Dr. Price’s College for 
Young Ladies, as assistant. The Institute continued four weeks. 
There were over two hundred teachers in attendance. ‘The course 
of study was regularly taken up, and very effective work was done 
throughout. Prof. D. A. Williams, of the Union City Training 
School; W. L. Willingham, of West Tennessee Normal College ; 
and Walter Brice, of Troy, rendered valuable assistance. At the 
close of the Institute resolutions were unanimously adopted indors- 
ing the management of the Institute, and asking its permanent 
location at Union City. 
OVERTON COUNTY. 
R. E. Brrgrey, Superintendent. 
I have the honor of submitting my first annual report of Over- 
ton County for the scholastic year ending June 30, 1895. I am 
9
-P-A-G-E-131
so 
somewhat late in sending in my report, owing to a failure of the 
Trustee to hand in his report. I have had great trouble this year 
in securing reports from our directors. The great trouble in our’ 
schools is the lack of funds. The people of Overton are becoming” 
more interested in the cause of education every year. I held a six- 
days’ Institute at Livingston, commencing July 8, conducted by 
Prof. A. J. Taylor. The Institute was a decided success. The 
number of teachers attending was 107. If we had a sufficient 
amount of school funds, I think the standard of education in Over- 
ton County would be raised to higher planes than ever before. 
_ PERRY COUNTY. 
L. G. Bunon, Superintendent. 
I herewith send you my first annual report of the public schools: 
of Perry County. 
Our schools are doing reasonably well. The zreat drawback is 
the lack of funds with which to run our schools longer. Our teach- 
ers are not as enthusiastic in their work as they should be. 
I held three Institutes this year with but very little success. ‘The 
teachers seemed to take very little interest. 
Our schools are all graded now, although this is the first year that 
they have been. We are using a uniform system of text books, 
adopted by the directors of the county. 
I think that with proper management our schools will continue 
to improve, and ere long will be, according to population, second 
to none in the State.

POLK COUNTY. 
A. E. Love, Superintendent. 
Enclosed herewith find my first annual report. It is as near cor- 
rect as I can make it from the reports submitted to me. 
Our ninth annual Normal Institute was held in Benton and was 
- very ably conducted by Prof. A. B. Nicholson. The attendance 
was very good, 43 out of 52 teachers being enrolled. All who at- 
tended join in saying that it was the best ever held,in the county. 
I have visited 36 schools and find the teachers, for the most part, 
doing good work. 
PUTNAM COUNTY. 
A. N. Forp, Superintendent. 
Herewith please find my annual report. 
I am pleased to say that our schools are in a prosperous condition. 
Our teachers, a very large per cent. of them at least, are alive to 
their duty and are taking a greater interest in their work than they 
have in any previous year. The pupils too are interested in like 
manner. 
Upon the whole I suppose, according to the amount of money 
and other opportunities we have, our schools are doing as wall: as 
we could reascnably expect.
-P-A-G-E-133

RHEA COUNTY. 
C. T. Srour, Superintendent. 
Please find enclosed my report for the year ending June 80, 1895. 
My report is as near perfect as I can make it, from the very imper- 
fect reports sent into me. I have been compelled to make some of 
my work by estimate, as I did not have full reports from some 
schools. Some of our schools are taught in churches. You will 
see from the report that there are more schools than school houses. 
I think our teachers are improving in their work and our schools 
are getting better each year. Our schools are very good, but they 
might be better. 
We have a Teachers’ Institute each month, and a great work of 
this kind is going on in Rhea County. 
ROBERTSON COUNTY. 
A. D. BraswEar, Superintendent. 
We held two Normal Schools. White Normal began June 15 and 
continued until July 38. We are proud to report this the largest and 
best attended Institute ever held in the county—87 enrolled and a 
daily attendance of 79. Weacknowledge the able and efficient as- 
sistance of Professors Huey, McNeeley, Moore, Prichard and others, 
all prominent teachers of this county. We feel that we are in the 
procession and marching (o the front, and hope ere long to be the 
banner county in the State. Our teachers are awake and making 
every effort to become thorough in their profession. We held atwo- 
days’ examination, pronounced the most rigid in the history of the 
county, and we thus weeded out the incompetent teachers. We 
propose to raise the standard in our county, issuing certificates to
-P-A-G-E-134
—133— 
none but the competent. Our schools are largely attended, and 
everything points to this as a prosperous year. 
Our colored Normal began July 15, and continued two weeks, 
with 34 teachers in daily attendance. This was also the largest 
colured Normal ever held in the county. About 66 percent. passed 
and were licensed. 
We have the county divided into four educational districts, and 
have a teachers’ meetIng every Saturday. 
SCOTT COUNTY. 
H. M. Rozsstns, Superintendent. 
I herewith submit my annual report of Scott County for the 
scholastic year ending June 30, 1895. Am late, owing to a failure 
on the part of the Trustee to hand in his report. 
At the present time there are twenty-three school districts in 
Scott County, in which there are sixty-nine sub-school districts— 
sixty-six for white children and three for colored children. We 
have sixty-five white primary schools, one white secondary school, 
and three colored primary schools. During the year the directors 
have had three very good frame school houses erected. 
I held two County Normals, one for the white teachers and one 
for the colored teachers. 
The County Normal held for white teachers began June 17, 1895, 
and closed Friday, June 28, 1895; principal conductor John W. Hy- 
den, of Knoxville, Tenn. There were eighty-eight enrolled as Nor- 
mal students. This was considered the most successful Normal] that 
has been held in this county. A larger number attended the Nor- 
mal than there were schools for in Scott County. Some attended 
from other counties. 
We have a uniform system of text-books adopted for Scott
-P-A-G-E-135
Bayete 
County by the directors. I found only a few other text-books 
being used in two schools that I visited this fall than those adopted. 
Oar schools are’very thoroughly graded. Teachers, directors 
and patrons are showing a very good interest in our public schools. 
I have visited most all the schools once, and some of them 
twice. 
SEQUATCHIE COUNTY. 
Ben F. Jones, Superintendent. 
Herewith I submit my annual report. 
I think the schools in our county are improving, and the im- 
provement that has come to them is the result, in the main, of bet- 
ter teaching ; and, if they still improve, our teachers must become 
more efficient. So, my main effort as Superintendent has been, and 
shall be, to improve the teachers in the connty. With this object 
in view, I held a four weeks’ Institute last June, in which the daily 
attendance was 25 per cent. more than the number of teachers in 
the county, and the enrollment was more than 150 per cent. of our 
teachers’ force. 
In our annual Institute and our semi-monthly Institutes, we have 
taken up a professional course of study. This year we have studied, 
and are studying, Parker’s Talks on Teaching and Hewett’s Psy- 
chology. At least 50 per cent. of our teachers are interested in this 
work. 
We need more money in our county, so that our schools may be 
longer. 
In our State we need a law that will come in between the unnat- 
ural parent—who would rather have a bushel of clay peas than an 
educated child—and his unfortunate offspring, and secure to it the
-P-A-G-E-136
—135— 
privilege of attending school. This does not compel the child, but 
secures to it the conditions of growth—the advantage it must have 
‘to become the best citizen. 
SEVIER COUNTY. 
  
J. L. Caron, Superintendent. 
  
Enclosed please find my first report of the schools of Sevier County 
for the year ending June 80, 1895. This report is not as full as it 
should be, but I have done the best I can from the directors’ re- 
ports and record of former Superintendent. 
We had a very interesting and successful Normal from July 1 to 
12, 1895. 
Our first local Institute was attended by forty teachers, repre- 
-senting 2,500 to 3,000 children. 
STEWART COUNTY. 
  
J. C. Fowier, Superintendent. 
  
I herewith submit to you my fifth annual report of the schools 
of Stewart County for the year ending June 30, 1895. I have 
visited nearly all the schools in the county, and find them getting 
along nicely. 
Our annual Institute, which was held in Cumberland City in 
July, was well attended, and much interest was manifested. 
In some respects our report does not show up as well as it did last 
year. This is caused on account of the shortness of funds. In some
-P-A-G-E-137
—136— 
places they had no school at all. We have too many shools and not 
money enough. Taking everything in consideration, we think the 
schools of Stewart County are getting along as well as could be ex- 
pected, 
SULLIVAN COUNTY. 
J. E. L. Senexer, Superintendent. 
Isend you herewith enclosed my third annual report. I called 
upon every district clerk in person, and, in many instances, assisted 
the clerk in making out his report. I have but little further to re- 
port regarding our schools. On looking over the reports of other 
Superintendents, I notice that a general similarity seems to exist 
in the standing and the conditions of the schools in the different 
counties of the State. Human nature being the same in different 
localities, I am persuaded, that it cannot be otherwise than that the 
same lamentable indifference on the part of some teachers, as well 
as directors and citizens, applies everywhere; while the spirit of 
progress, the interest manifested in educational enterprises, and the 
consequent improvement of the schools that characterize one 
county find a parallel in nearly every other county in the State. 
This being the case, it should not be expected that Sullivan is far 
ahead or behind other counties in the grand effort to elevate the 
common schools to a higher degree of excellence. If there is, how- 
ever, any tendency to either extreme, I think I can conscientiously 
say it is not toward the latter; if we have ever kept up with the 
rapid strides toward improvement, I think we have done well. Our 
present corps of teachers are zealous, earnest workers, and are gen- 
erally interested in school literature. 
We have a well organized Teachers’ Association, as well as a 
Directors’ Educational Association. Our course of study has been 
revised, and most of our schools are systematically graded. 
We have this year about eighty-five schools; of these nineteen 
aré secondary, and seven are high schools.
-P-A-G-E-138
aay 
Our directors have this year shown commendable zeal in repair- 
ing school-houses, building new ones, and in supplying suitable fur- 
niture. At Piney Flats, a splendid brick school building, to cost 
five thousand dollars, is now in process of construction. 
Our last annual Institute was quite successful ; about seventy-five 
teachers were in attendance. The work bore directly and prac- 
tically upon the duties of the school-room. The teachers took 
home food for thought and zeal for action. Great harmony and 
earnestness were characteristics of the Institute throughout. 
The outlook is cheerful, though there is much work to be accom- 
plished to place the schools of Sullivan County where wejwould like 
to see them. 
SHELBY COUNTY. 
Miss Lipa G. Tuomas, Superintendent. 
My annual report for 1895 is herewith submitted. You will 
please excuse the delay—as you may note I am nine,days behind— 
caused by tardy district clerks. In some instances I have had to go 
out after reports. 
SMITH COUNTY. 
J. G. Brown, Superintendent. 
I herewith submit my report of the schools of Smith County for 
the year ending June 30, 1895. It is entirely correct, except that 
prt copied from the County Trustee’s report, which is approxi- 
mately so.
-P-A-G-E-139
—138— 
TIPTON COUNTY. 
Jos. A. Corron, Superintendent. 
I have the honor to hand herewith my fifth annual report. The 
directors have been more prompt in forwarding their reports this 
year than usual. Our teachers and our schools are steadily im- 
proving. 
The summer Normal, furnished by our liberal County Court, was 
asuceess. Mr. J. C. Brooks, Superintendent of the City Schools of 
Covington, and Miss Fannie King, primary teacher in the Jackson 
City School, did most excellent work, and our teachers were great- 
ly benefitted by their labor. We were in session three weeks, and 
the deepest interest was manifested each day by teachers and in- 
structors. 
UNICOI COUNTY. 
R. W. H. Gitperr, Superintendent. 
I herewith transmit you my report for the year ending June 30, 
1895. 
As to the educational interest of Unicoi County, I will say it is 
not what I wish, but, Iam sure, will favorably compare with any, 
and I believe is in advance of many of the counties of the State. 
This is evidenced by the per cent. of our scholastic population en- 
rolled in the schools and the per cent. of attendance. For the year 
embraced in my report the enrollment was 93 (niuety-three) per 
cent. of the entire scholastic population, and the attendance 85 
(eighty-five) per cent. of the number enrolled. This, I think, shows 
the educational interest in Unicoi County to be good. 
I am sure no county in the State can boast of teachers more 
   
-P-A-G-E-140
—139— 
deeply interested, or who put forth more energy in behalf of those 
-confided to their care, than do the teachers of Unicoi County. 
I require the teachers of my county to attend the Institutes and 
educational meetings in the county, and read books and papers on 
the science and art of teaching. I believe the teachers in my 
county do this, and I find nothing more helpful and instructive to 
the teachers and conducive to the educational interest of my county 
than good literature. 
The question is often asked, “‘ How can we create and maintain 
an educational interest among parents and pupils”? My answer 
is, By good teaching. 
The schools this year have opened with brighter prospects than 
ever before, and we are hopeful of better results. 
Our moito is, Onward and upward, and constant improvement. 
UNION COUNTY. 
Franiz B. SuHarp, Superintendent. 
Find enclosed my first annual report. I held in July my annual 
examination for five days. Our examination was the most rigid ever 
given in this county, and the result was we kicked all but compe- 
tent teachers out. I have visited all of the schools, and find them 
doing good work. Every school in the county is graded for the 
first time. 
We are having Institutes every two weeks. The people are lend- 
ing a helping hand, and from the prospect we will have the best 
schools we ever had in loyal old Union, 
The Trustee has not made his report yet, but I am going to send 
my report on, and if it is not too late let me know, and when he
-P-A-G-E-141
—140— 
reports, then I will. My predecessors have not done their duty, and 
my report isno good. I will give you a good report next yesr if I 
live to carry out my plans. 
VAN BUREN COUNTY. 
J. A. Saviey, Superintendent. 
Enclosed you will find my first annual report of the public 
schools of Van Buren County. 
While the report is not a complete one, it is the best I can make 
it at present. Ihave been very greatly delayed in making my re- 
port, from the fact that the directors were late in reporting, and: 
many of the teachers have made no report at all. 
The educational interests of Van Buren County have long been 
cata very low ebb, but they are slowly rising. The one great draw- 
back to our schools is the limited amount of means. They are so 
‘low, and our schools so short, we cannot command the best teach- 
ers. They seek employment elsewhere. 
In a few years we hope to see the cause of education in our 
county far in advance of what it is now. 
‘WARREN COUNTY. 
H. P. StrussLerie.p, Superintendent. 
In compliance with the requirements of the public school Jaw of 
Tennessee I herewith submit my first annual report concerning the 
public schools of Warren County for the year ending June 30, 1895.
-P-A-G-E-142
- 
—141— 
In addition to my tabulated report, I submit the following remarks 
eoncerning ihe management, progress and efficiency of the public 
schools of this county. 
During the month of July last I held, in McMinnville, an Insti- 
tute for a period of six days, which was attended by most all teach- 
ers of this and many from adjoining counties. In this Institute 
work much good was accomplished by means of discussing and in- 
ducing teachers to adopt and practice the most efficient methods of 
instruction. Hence, in general, a better class of teachers was secured 
and the schools of the county are being conducted on better plans, 
and are better succeeding in the impartation of information than 
ever before in this county. Most of our teachers are well qualified 
for the assumption and discharge of the duties imposed upon them 
as teachers, and, fortunately for the children of the county, the time 
has passed when any novice can obtain a position as teacher in this 
county. None except ladies and gentlemen of moral, intellectual 
and scientific attainments are permitted tv occupy positions as teach- 
ers. Directors and patrons, more than heretofore, manifest an in- 
terest in the progress and prosperity of the schools in general, and as 
a result of this the attendance is much better than it has been here- 
tofore. I have but little cause to complain of the management and 
efficiency of our schools, other than of the neglect on the part of 
some directors and teachers to make to this office some of the re- 
quired reports, which fact detracts from my xeport a degree: of cor- 
rectness that it otherwise would contain. The want of sufficient 
means renders our schools of less duration than is desired. We 
should have not less than one hundred school days annually, and I 
shall endeavor to induce the county court to Jevy a tax sufficient to 
hereafter run our public schools five months per year. With 
schools of this length all will be able to acquire at least the element- 
ary principles of an English education. Some legislation is needed 
for the betterment of our public school system, but as that is not 
within my line of duty I-will not here mention what, in my opin- 
ion, should be done by the Legislature. I have devoted much time 
to the work of aiding and assisting directors and teachers of the 
county during my term of office, and am pleased to say that the 
schools are well attended, moving on quietly and harmoniously, and — 
much good, efficient work is being accomplished.
-P-A-G-E-143
—142— 
WAYNE COUNTY. 
Laura THornton, Superintendent. 
You will find enclosed my third annual report. I take pleasure: 
in stating that our schools are steadily improving. Our teachers: 
are doing excellent work. 
As you will find, my report is not complete, but it is the best 
that I could do, for I could not prevail on the Trustee to make his. 
report to me, and the law makes no provision for me to obtain the 
required information from any other source. I sent my report last 
year, and it was returned for the lack of the same, and the Judge 
made the calculations for the items required in the Trustee’s report,. 
but he refuses to do so this year. 
WHITE COUNTY. 
R. L. Jones, Superintendent. 
You will find enclosed the annual report of the public schools of 
White County for the year ending June 30, 1895. 
While we have made some advancement, yet we cannot say, “ere 
long, ours will be the banner county ” in the State in point of educa-- 
tion. 
We have often noted with pride and pleasure the growth of in- 
terest in one community, or even one whole civil district, while at 
the same time in another community there are wranglings and dis- 
sensions among the people over the teacher, politics, religion,! or’ 
something else, thus dividing the people into contentious factions, 
thereby destroying the school interest. This year a perfect wave 
of contrariness has swept over White County, and the school interest 
has suffered greatly on that account. In several cases the people-
-P-A-G-E-144
—143— 
are stubborn, in others the directors are at fault; and in some cases- 
both are to blame. Our present method of electing directors is 
very objectionable. It often happens that three men are elected 
jointly that could not be elected at all singly. As every voter is 
allowed to vote for three directors, the three candidates combine 
their strength, and each candidate receives three times as many 
votes as he could were there but one to elect. 
The “hard times” has cut our enrollment and daily attendance 
both down somewhat lower than last year. But the greatest draw- 
back to our schools is the great length of time teachers have to 
wait to get money on their warrants. It is six months, or nearly 
so, before they get any of their money, and, in many instances, 
more than a year hefore they get it all. They either have to wait 
this long interval or shave their warrants 15 or 20 per cent. We 
are striving to remedy this by keeping back a portion of the funds 
this year with which to pay off back indebtedness, and aim to do like- 
wise next year, and hope such will be kept up till the county gets 
on a cash basis. The time has never been in this county when 
school warrants were at par. While we have these and other dis- 
advantuges, yet there are many things to encourage the friends of 
education in our county. i 
White County has kept up a monthly Institute for the entire year 
for the past eight years, and has held seven consecutive summer In- 
stitutes of two weeks’ duration, all of which have been well attended. 
Our Institute this year was well attended, there being more teachers 
present than could get schools in the county. We were ably as- 
sisted in the work by our own county teachers, and also received the 
aid of President R. A. Clark, of the Winchester Normal, who de- 
livered two excellent lectures, and treated the subjects of arithmetic 
and algebra to the satisfaction of all present. President W. N. 
Billingsley, of Burritt College, was with'us, and contributed largely 
to the success of the Institute. He delivered a series of lectures on 
school management. Prof. Wheeler, of Pleasant Hill Academy, 
was with us a few days, and delivered a practical lecture. Prof. T- 
R. Hudson, an enthusiastic young teacher of Emory and Henry 
College, was with us one week, and treated the subject of grammar 
in an interesting and practical manner. At the close of the In- _
-P-A-G-E-145
—144— 
stitute we held an examination, which most of the teachers passed 
ereditably ; some, however, failed. We held the colored teachers 
an Institute of one week, which was well attended. 
We have visited all the schools in the county, with the exception 
of two. 
WILSON COUNTY. 
H. R. Brrowerr, Superintendent. 
  
Enclosed find my fourth annual report of the public schools of 
Wilson County. 
Lam glad to say we are making advancements along the differ- 
erent educational lines. 
During the last scholastic year we have had a very successful 
State Institute, conducted by Hon. W. R. Garrett, one of the fore- 
most educators of the State. Capt. Garrett had the hearty co- 
operation of every teacher, and much lasting good was accom- 
plished. He was ably assisted by Prof. W. J. Grannis, of Cumber- 
land University, and Prof. F. M. Bowling, of Watertown High 
School. 
We have endeavored to carry out the suggestions of the State 
Superintendent in reference to the examination of teachers, which 
I think have proved very beneficial. 
Our directors watch after the school fund closer than ever before. 
‘I think our schools are constantly growing in favor with all 
classes of people, and becoming more popular every year.

In the Districts marked with a star (*), the scholarship will be 
vacant in May, 1896, and these vacancies will be filled by a com- 
petitive examination held on July 21 and 22, 1896, at the county 
‘seat of each county in the District where the vacancy occurs. These 
examinations are conducted by the County Superintendents; the
-P-A-G-E-153
—152— 
papers are sent to the State Board of Education at Nashville; are 
there examined and valued by experts, and the scholarship awarded 
to the candidate in each District whose grading is the highest. In 
case there is no competitor in a given District, or no paper worthy 
of a scholarship, the vacancy will be filled for one year, by the State 
Board, by the appointment of some non-scholarship student already 
in the College ; but at the end of the year this scholarship will be 
again valued, to be filled by competitive examination within the 
District. 
The liberal treatment of the College by the General Assembly 
continues, and this liberal policy is especially gratifying to Dr. 
Curry, the General Agent, as well as to the Peabody Board as 
a whole. The uniform policy of this Board is that of generous co- 
operation with local effort. The General Assembly appreciates the 
fact that Tennessee reaps far greater advantages from the Peabody 
Normal College than any other State probably can, and with prac- 
tical unanimity makes its bi-ennial appropriation of $15,000.00, 
yearly. At the last session, in addition to this sum, the General 
Assembly made a special appropriation of $5,000.00 a year, for two 
years, for the endowment of a chair of American History. A part 
of this sum is devoted to the purchase of books and manuscripts 
bearing especially on the history of Tennessee, and to the publica- 
tion of that invaluable series of papers known as the Robertson 
Letters. 
By the unanimous vote of the State Board of Education, Dr. 
William R. Garrett, ex-Superintendent of Public Instruction of 
Tennessee, was called to this new chair, and he entered on his du- 
ties at the opening of the present session. In addition to his ordi- 
nary duties, Dr. Garrett is editing the Robertson Letters, and has the 
first installment nearly ready for distribution to subscribers. 
Organically connected with the Normal College is the Winthrop 
Model School, the purpose of which is to illustrate in actual prac- 
tice the most approved methods of elementary instruction. This 
school now contains 250 pupils, and its course of study covers nine 
grades of the typical public school. Pupils who complete this 
course are admitted to the College without examination. The orig- 
inal plan was to organize the four primary grades only, and over-
-P-A-G-E-154
—153— 
tures were made to the public school authorities of Nashville to al- 
low children whofhad completed this course in the model school to 
enter the fifth grade of the public schools, but these overtures were 
rejected, and it then became necessary to extend the course of study 
into the high school grade. The consequence has been that there 
is now offered to thefpublic a carefully graded system of instruction 
extending from the model school, through the Normal College, into 
the University of Nashville ; so that, for a merely nominal sum, a 
liberal education is within the reach of any child who is ambitious 
to make a fair start in life. 
The grade of the Normal College is being raised from year to 
year as fast as the condition of public instruction throughout the 
country will allow it. It is plain that any sudden and considerable 
rise in the requirements for admission would cut the school off from 
its constituency, so that the approach to a high college standard 
must be gradual. It is the policy of the College, from year to year 
to transfer to the Model School the work that is of the high school 
grade, and in theend to make its course of instruction collegiate in 
fact as well asinname. All that the public can reasonably demand 
is that the College make a continuous growth upward in the line of 
sound learning, but at all times to keep within sympathetic range 
of the people. 
It is my sad duty to chronicle the death, on Dec. 16, 1894, of 
Robert C. Winthrop, the President of the Peabody Board of Trust, 
and the ardent friend of the Peabody Normal Oollege. It was his 
ambition to make this College a living monument to the memory 
of George Peabody, the revered benefactor of his country, and par- 
ticularly of the South; and it is my ambition, to the extent of my 
ability, to carry into effect his pious wish. 
Respectfully submitted,

UNIVERSITY OF NASHVILLE. 
To Hon. S.'G. GiLBREATH, Superintendent of Public Instruction: 
I herewith present my first annual report as Chancellor of the 
University of Nashville: 
The University of Nashville, founded in 1785 as Davidson 
Academy, and reorganized in 1806 as Cumberland College, discon- 
tinued its functions in 1850, on the resignation of President Philip 
Lindsley. Five years later the literary department was reorganized 
as a military school, with Dr. J. Berrien Lindsley as Chancellor. 
In 1861 the civil war made another break in the life of the literary 
department of this institution ; but.at its close the military school 
was again organized by Gen. E. Kirby Smith. Finally, in 1875, 
an arrangement was made between the trustees of the university, 
the Peabody Board of Trust, and the General Assembly of Ten- 
nessee, whereby the literary department of the university became 
the State Normal College, now known as the Peabody Normal Col- 
lege, the name having been changed in 1889. 
In the year 1850 the medical department of the university was 
organized, and there has been no interruption of its sessions from 
that time to the present. In the year 18— this department entered 
into an alliance with the medical department of Vanderbilt Uni- 
versity, and the first school was maintained in the medical buildings 
of the University of Nashville, till the present year, when the alli- 
ance was dissolved by mutual consent, and there was restored to the 
old university its own medical department. During the past sum- 
mer the trustees erected a new and commodious medical college on 
Market street, facing the university campus, within five minutes 
walk of the City Hospital. The faculty, composed mainly of the 
gentlemen who had served the first school so acceptably, was reor- 
ganized, a three years’ graded course of instruction adopted, and on 
October —, 1895, the forty-fourth session opened under ‘the most 
auspicious circumstances, and the registration is now larger than 
that of the joint school in its best days. It is thus seen that through 
one or both of its departments the life of the University of Nash- 
ville has been continuous from its foundation, in 1785, to the present
-P-A-G-E-156
—155— 
date ; and it is safe to say, that with the exception of the University 
of Virginia, no institution in the South has had so wide and benefi- 
cent an influence on its history as this. ‘ 
As before stated, the Peabody Normal College is now the literary 
department of the University of Nashville. The connection of the 
two institutions is not an accidental, but a necessary one; for no 
professional school of high grade can be maintained unless it is con- 
nected with unversity traditions and inspired by university influ- 
ence. Wholesome progress in the art of education is dependent 
on the formation of a real teaching profession ; but such a profession 
is not possible unless its members are men and women of scholarly 
tastes and attainments, and wrought into corporate unity by tra- 
ditions and ties proceeding from a common source. These traditions 
and ties descend upon the professions from the universities with 
which they are connected. 
Through the siuister influence of so-called normal schools of the 
sporadic type, a suspicion of shallowness and pedantry often lies 
against teachers who have been educated in normal schools honestly 
conducted. It is a misdemeanor to induce young people to believe 
that by “normal” methods they can learn geometry in twelve 
weeks, and read Cxsar, Virgil, Cicero and Horace within one year. 
The pedantry of teachers who have been the victims of these false 
notions very naturally produces distrust and disgust among sensible 
people, and by a sort of false induction the whole teaching profes- 
sion is brought into some measure of disrespect. On this account 
there should be schools for the education of teachers, where liberal 
training and sound learning are at least a tradition. 
The formation of a teaching profession requires not only a train- 
ing of the liberal type, but also the possession of a professional de- 
gree, as that of Bachelor, Master or Doctor. In their origin, di- 
plomas were not merely university decorations in homes, but were 
professionanal licenses to teach; and it is but the restoration of an 
an ancient university procedure to invest the graduates of our pro- 
fessional schools with those professional degrees. 
Our Normal College course covers a period of only two years, 
and on its completion the student receives the degree of Licentiate 
of Instruction; but at an early date in the history of the school 
these graduates were encouraged to spend another year in study, 
and were then graduated with the Bachelor’s degree. In all proper
-P-A-G-E-157
—156— 
ways I have fostered the student’s desire to extend | is scholar- 
ship and his ambition to earn a real professional degree ; and the 
gratifying consequence has been that that these university classes 
have grown larger from year to year, anJ that this upward move- 
ment has extended to post-graduate work leading to the Master’s 
degree. At the last Commencement, University degrees were con- 
ferred on fifty-one students, and sixteen of these fell to residents of 
Tennessee, as follows: 
BacHetor or LETrers.

Doctor or Purmosorxy. 
On J. Harris Chappell, A.M., President of the Georgia Normal and Industrial 
School. 
Doctor or Laws. 
On Professor Edward C. Benson, D.D., of Kenyon College. 
On Robert B. Fulton, A.M., Chancellor of the University of Mississippi. 
The courses of study reaching to the degrees named, while fairly 
equal to those offered by the greater number of Southern colleges, 
still fall considerably short of what University courses should be ;
-P-A-G-E-158
—157— 
but no student is deceived into the belief that these courses are 
what they are not. The graduate is sensible that his education is 
imperfect, but he has that wholesome consciousness of his imper- 
fections which is the beginning of wisdom, and he is thereby saved 
from the sins of pedantry. 
In order to affect society beneficently, institutions of learnirg 
must be adapted to the educational condition and needs of the con- 
stituency which they are designed to serve, and their standard 
must not be so high as to be unattainable by those who are ambi- 
tions to pass beyond the schools in which their preparation must be 
made. What is required is that this standard shall advance from 
year to year, in keeping with the upward progress made in public 
institutions. A school should always be somewhat better than the 
public at any given moment demands. 
Even in its present imperfect organization, the University of 
Nashville is well adapted to be the head of the public school sys- 
tem of Tennessee. It is undenominational ; it is conservative and 
yet progressive; it may readily be brought into organic relations 
with the public high schools; it is supplying the State with pro- 
fessionally educated teachers in large numbers; it is open to young 
men and to young women on equal terms; its charges for tuition 
are merely nominal. 
At this date the statistics of enrollment for the University of 
Nashville and its allied sehools are as follows :

PROCEEDINGS 
OF 
PusBLic SCHOOL OFFICERS’ ASSOCIATION, 
HELD IN THE SENATE CHAMBER, DEC. 10-41, 7895. 
The Association was called to order by the President, Hon. Thos. 
H. Paine, at 10 o’clock A.m., and was opened with prayer by Rev. 
R. Lin Cave. : 
Following this was the Address of Welcome, by Gov. Turney: 
“Tadies and Gentlemen: 
“For the second time since I have been your Chief Executive it 
becomes my pleasure to welcome this body to the capital of the 
State. It is always a pleasure to the patriotic and the philanthropic 
to meet with and see gathered together those engaged in the promo- 
tion of intellectual and mental strength, and as I have stated to you 
on a former occasion, I know of no calling higher than the one that 
has for its object the development of mankind. It is certainly a 
very high responsibility, a responsibility that is only surpassed, if 
surpassed at all, by the obligations resting upon the minister of the 
gospel. Your duty isa very serious one anda very onorous one 
and a very responsible one, and the men and women that engage in 
an undertaking as you have are entitled to very great credit and 
very great respect, and are and should be of very great courage. 
As a matter of course, you can only develop others by developing 
yourself, I repeat that I am glad to see you here, and hope your 
meeting will be a harmonious one and a useful one, and one that 
will result in much benefit to those under your charge and to those 
who are to be affected by its results, either directly or indirectly, 
until it permeates the whole land ; and not only so, but as you go 
forth—those who are to teach—that it shall permeate the whole 
land, and that the impressions made upon the minds of those under 
you, will be impressions that will last through life and that will 
11
-P-A-G-E-163
—162— 
grow and continue to grow and spread as your students may spread 
themselves over the country. This I say again is a most responsi- 
ble position, this is a most honorable position, and all who are pa- 
triots, all who are philanthropists, all who love their kind, must 
admire the people who engage in your work. I bid you a most 
hearty welcome to the capital city, with the earnest desire that your 
work here today and hereafter may be prosperous and successful.’” 
(Applause.) 
Response, by Hon. T. Leigh Thompson : 
“Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen : 
“In the absence of Mr. Armistead I have been requested to re- 
spond to the address of welcome. I wish to express to you my re- 
gret that Mr. Armistead is not here. I know him personally and 
he is a very eloquent young man, and a young man who would en- 
tertain you. 
“Tn making this response I assure the Governor that we most 
heartily appreciate the welcome which he has extended to the Pub- 
lic School Officers’ Association of the State of Tennessee, and that 
they fully realize and appreciate the responsibility resting upon 
them as teachers, as superintendents, and as officers of the public 
school system of the State, and Iam sure that this Association is 
determined in its efforts to carry forward the educational interest 
that was inaugurated in the very beginning of the organization of 
our State. I think it is greatly to the credit of the founders of this 
State that in the first territorial legislation they made upon the soil 
of Tennessee, provisions were made for the establishment of two 
educational institutions or colleges, and that the work of education 
has been carried forward throughout the history of our State. The 
main idea, at least one of the most prominent phases of the work in 
this State, has been the nourishment and encouragement of educa- 
tional institutions. I admit with a great deal of embarrassment 
that there has been at various times in our State’s history a lack of 
interest upon the part of the Legislature of the State to do justice to 
the educational interests of this State; but, aside from that, we can 
congratulate ourselves that Tennessee has at various times and with 
very few exceptions, done her duty towards advancing the progress 
of education, and, as the Governor has said, it devolves upon you 
principally to carry forward this work of education in perfecting
-P-A-G-E-164
—163— 
her laws and in carrying out the provisions made by legislative 
enactment. 
“Upon behalf of the members of this Association I express our 
high appreciation of the welcome which has been extended to us to 
the capital city of the State of Tennessee.” (Applause.) 
President’s Address, by Hon. Thos. H. Payne: 
“Ladies and Gentlemen : 
“The great purpose of this organization is to offer an opportunity 
to those in charge of our schools throughout the State—especially 
those whose duty it is under the law to guide and direct the schools 
of each county—to confer with each other and to discuss the ques- 
tions connected with the welfare and general progress of the schools, 
to the end that they may be improved in every possible way. I 
therefure congratulate you on this opportunity of coming together, 
talking to each other and swapping thoughts on subjects connected 
with the great work before you. 
“This is truly a progressive age. There is now no resting place 
in the march of human society. Our school teachers and school 
officers must therefore keep wide awake, and as the age moves on 
they should move on with it, and, in many respects, they should 
lead it. Our sehools should be relieved of that ‘old dull, dead 
routine’ which characterized the district school of only a few 
decades ago. They should all be imbued with that life and spirit 
of progress which I am glad to say may be found in most of them. 
This requires vigilance on the part of superintendents, with scholar- 
ship, energy and sound discretion on the part of teachers, and a 
laudable ambition on the part of both to do good. Scholarship and 
broad culture are of course necesessary qualifications of a teacher, 
but they are by no means the only qualifications. You had as well 
say that because a man is a good mathematician he can navigate a 
ship as to say because a man is a scholar he can teach school. 
There must be, in addition to scholarship, broad general culture, 
and other special qualifications which every observer of good schools 
has found the teachers of such echools to possess in a greater or less 
degree, such as professional training, experience and tact. Here, 
my fellow-superintendents, is where your workcomes in. You are 
supposed to be good judges of the qualifications necessary to success- 
ful teaching. You should therefore use in a modest way your 
strongest influence on the ‘powers that be’ to induce them to em-
-P-A-G-E-165
—164— 
ploy the very best teachers in the list of applicants. It is our duty 
to give our Boards of Education such information and aid as may 
be in our power in the selection and employment of teachers. They — 
expect us to do this, and we should meet the responsibility prompt- 
ly, but we should be careful to look closely to the fitness of those 
whom we recommend. y 
“Tt has been said that ‘as is the teacher so is the school.’ Much, 
therefore, depends on the wisdom of the school board and the coun- 
sel of the Superintendent in our Tennessee system of public in- 
struction. Quoting my own language, used on a different occasion, 
I may say that ‘schools are like skiffs propelled by rowers on the 
bosom of a river, the moment the effort ceases the bout drifts down 
with the tide. Constant effort is necessary to keep our schools ad- 
vancing, and the sooner this fact is fully realized by every teacher 
and every school officer the better for the schools.” 
“A great field lies out before you; it may be cultivated or neg- 
lected. It is full of hope and promise, and to the ‘truly chosen’ 
there is a rich reward. But these are to be enjoyed in proportion 
to the painstaking labor given to its culture. 
“Our Legislature, in its wisdom, has given us a good school law, © 
in the main. It needs some amendments in its details, and Iam 
glad to cee that at each succeeding session of the General Assembly 
improvements of our school law receive a large share of the atten- 
tion and time of that body. It only remains for us, who are con- 
nected with the internal workings of the system, and have opportu- 
nity to observe its defects, to keep coustantly before our law-makers 
“such amendments and improvements as, in our judgment, will best 
serve the welfare and general progress of our schools. I have no 
doubt that our able committee on needed reforms in our public 
school system will look well to this matter, and give us something 
to recommend to our law-making power. 
“We entertain a veneration for the wisdom and glorious deeds of 
the distinguished soldiers and statesmen who have contributed so 
much to make our State famous, both in war and in peace. Every 
citizen of the State who is familiar with the names and acts of John 
Sevier, Andrew Jackson and James K. Polk, and who realizes that 
the State has lost none of the prestige given it by these, and many 
other great men whose names adorn our annals, can fail to feel 
proud that he is a Tennessean. The one hundredth anniversary of 
 
-P-A-G-E-166
—165— 
our Statehood will, in a few days, be ushered in, to become a part 
of our history. Arrangements are being made to celebrate this 
great event. An Exposition is to be held in this, our capital city. 
I entertain no doubt that each of you feel a profound interest in the 
success of this great enterprise, and I need not make appeal to your 
patriotism and induce you to aid this cause by your influence at 
home. I need not suggest to you that the schools can and should 
do much to promote the general interest of this occasion. People 
in other States and in other countries have read our history, and we 
want to invite them now to come and see us. We want to show 
them specimens of our great and varied resources. We want them 
to see our rich valleys, our productive hills, and our mountains, too ; 
in a word, we want them to see Tennessee, from Jounson to Shelby ; 
and enjoy our genial climate and the hospitality of our people. 
“Speaking of the Centennial and thinking of the State pride it 
will excite, reminds me of the importance of teaching patriotism in 
our public schools. This may be done incidentally, as the pupils 
pass {rom day to day over the course of study, and especially as 
they study reading and history. One suggestion here and another 
there, without serious hindrance to the prosecution of their studies, 
may serve to kindle a flame of patriotism that will make the pupil 
fully realize that this is ‘My own, my native land.’ Ina few years 
the pupils now in the public schools will become the active cilizens 
of the State. They should, therefore, be thoroughly versed in 
every branch that tends to the attainment of good citizenship. 
They should be impressed with the responsibility of the ballot, and 
that, whether it be quietly deposited in the box of the home pre- 
cinct or in the councils of the nation at Washington, it represents 
the voter’s part in shaping the destiny of the country. 
“Then, with continued progress along the lines I have so briefly 
noticed, may we not apply to our nation the prophesy of the poet— 
“Wide shall our free race increase, 
And wide extend the elastic chain 
That binds us in everlasting peace— 
State after State—one mighty train.’”

Among the prominent educators present, many of whom took 
part in the exercises, were the following: Capt. W. R. Garrett, 
Prof. A. D. Wharton, S. A. Link, W.T. Davis, Wyckliffe Rose, R. 
L. McDonald, Claude J. Bell, J. W. Blair, Miss Medora Glaze,

H. C. Weber, of Nashville; H. W. Louis, of Jackson; H. Camp, 
of Doyle’s Station; L. S. Ewton, of Sequatchie Valley, and Hon. 
Frank M. Smith, ex-State Superintendent. 
Supt. Gilbreath: Mr. Chiirman, owing to sickness in the fami- 
ly of Capt. C. S. Douglass, Chairman of Committee on Educational 
Exhibit at Tennessee Centennial, Capt. Douglass cannot be here 
this morning, but expects to be with us this afternoon. He requests 
that Prof. G. R. McGee be appointed to act in his place until he 
comes. 
The President: By request I appoint Supt. McGee to act in 
Capt. Douglass’ place until he comes. 
Supt. Gilbreath: It has been recommended or suggested—but 
the matter will be left to the Association to decide finally—that as 
Thursday will be “Tenuessee Centennial” day at the Atlanta Expo- 
sition, with a fare from Nashville of $5 for the round trip, that the 
work of this Association be carried through in two days, if possible, 
and that we adjourn Wednesday evening in time to start to Atlanta 
Wednesday night.
-P-A-G-E-168
—167— 
The President: What is the will of the Association ? 
On motion it was decided that the work of the Association be 
completed in two days, in accordance with recommendation of Supt. 
Gilbreath. 
Prof. Goodman: Ihave a letter from Dr. Price, but failed to 
bring it with me, giving the invitation that has been extended to 
us from year to year to attend an entertainment to be given com- 
plimentary to this Association, at the Nashville College for Young 
Ladies. I hope we will all arrange to go. 
Supt. Gilbreath: Superintendent Barrett, Chairman of the Com- . 
mittee on Patriotism in the Public Schools, is not here aud will not 
be here. I move that the work of his committee be given to the 
Committee on Educational Exhibit at the Tennessee Centennial. I 
will also incorporate in this a motion that the work of the third 
committee, Legislation Needed to Protect the School Fund, be 
combined with that of the Committee on Needed Reforms in our 
Public School System, that Prof. Henderson be chairman of both 
committees, and that the President appoint a Committee on C unty 
Cireulating Libraries. 
Supt. H. D. Huffaker: Mr. President, in view of the fact that 
we are to do three days’ work in two, I want to second that motion 
very heartily. 
The President: The motion is to consolidate those four com- 
mittees into two. Are you ready for the question ? 
The motion carried unanimously and the committees were con- 
solidated accordingly. 
Prof. Goodman: As there is still an hour and a half before din- 
ner time, I suggest that the committees get fogether and see what 
material they have. 
The President: I think that is a wise suggestion. Iwould like 
for the chairmen of these committees to report to the Chair imme- 
diately after we meet in the afternoon, so that vacancies may be 
supplied. 
Supt. Huffaker: I suggest that the next order of business be 
left off until the last thing, and, if necessary, that exercise can be 
left off entirely. I therefore move that the programme be changed 
so the “Roll-call by Counties” will come the last thing. 
Motion seconded. 
Superintendent J. H. Allen: I move in lieu of Supt. Huffaker’s
-P-A-G-E-169
—168— 
motion that the “Roll-call by Counties” be dispensed with, includ- 
ing the usual three-minute speeches, for the present session. We 
will be pressed for time, and we have work that is more important. 
Motion seconded. 
The Chair: You propose to amend the motion by moving to 
omit that part of the programme? The question before you now 
is on the motion of Supt. Allen, of Bedford, that that part of the 
programme be omitted calling for the roll-call by counties and re- 
quiring responses. 
Supt. C. L. Hayes: I would like to amend by saying “de- 
ferred”; is may be we will have time for that. 
Supt. Allen: I do not accept the amendment. 
Supt. Huffaker: I think Superintendent Hayes and I are ex- 
actly together ; my motion covers the ground fully. 
The Chair: The original motion as amended by Superintendent 
Allen now comes before you—that this part of the programme be 
omitted. . 
Supt. Huffaker: We may get through; if time be found, why 
not leave it open that we may take up the work if we have time 
for it? 
Supt. Henderson: I am with Supt. Huffaker; we have already 
consolidated some of the committees and there are some of the com- 
mittees that will make short reports. Some will bea little lengthy 
perhaps and take some time, but other reports may be very short, 
and we may get through and have time. Let us simply defer this 
matter and take it up later. 
The Chair: Those who vote for this motion of course vote to 
take that part out. 
Prof. Goodman: Suppose we adopt Superintendent Allen’s mo- 
tion. We can reconsider it at any time to-morrow and go on with 
the work, if desired. We have certain work in hand to be done ; 
and again, will uot the State Superintendent’s report embrace the 
report from every County Superintendent, and more fully than can 
be given in these three-minute responses? As a general thing, 
these reports are duplicates of the reports furnished by the County 
Superintendents to the State Superintendent. 
Supt. Allen: There is another reason I have for haking my mo- 
tion: we may have to-morrow afternoon time for a few, perhaps 
half, of the counties to report, and have to drop the others out.
-P-A-G-E-170
SS 6925 
Besides, it will give us an opportunity to fiuish up all the most im- 
portant business before us. We will know to a certainty in the be- 
ginning of this meeting what we have to do. 
The Chair: Are you ready for the question on the motion to dis- 
pose of this part of the programme, with the understanding as al- 
ready indicated, that another motion will be made? Those in favor 
of the motion vote “aye,” opposed “no.” : 
Motion lost. 
Supt. Huffaker: The original motion before the house is on, my 
motion, I think. 
The Chair: The question is now on the motion of Superinten- 
dent Huffaker that this part of the programme be deferred for the 
present. 
“Supt. Huffaker: That this part of the programme be placed at 
the close of the session instead of at the first. 
Motion carried. 
Frank H. Smith: Mr. President, am I a member of this Asso- 
ciation ? 
The Chair: I shall recognize you, sir. 
Mr. Smith: Mr. President, I make this suggestion: Mrs. Settle 
is with us and has a very important question to bring before this 
body, and I think in view of the amount of work we have we ought 
to hear her this morning. I think we ought to suspend the pro- 
gramme and hear Mrs. Settle this morning. She wishes to talk to 
you in regard to an amendment to the school laws in regard to the 
effects of alcohol and narcotics on the human system. She will take 
the time of the Association for only a few moments. 
The President: We will recognize Mrs. Settle. 
Mrs, Settle: Mr. President, I am much obliged to you gentlemen 
and ladies for your kindness in allowing me to come before you 
again. The last Legislature, as you know, passed a law providing 
“for the study of physiology and hygiene, with special reference to the 
effects of alcohol and narcotics on the human system, but did not 
specify text-books, and that is why I am before you this morning. 
I wish to get all the information I can on this subject and how this 
study is to be taught in the public schools. The Jaw says that it 
shall be taught as thoroughly as other studies and the law says it 
shall be a regular course of study in the public schools, in all schools 
supported entirely or in part by public money. Now, gentlemen,
-P-A-G-E-171
alte 
there are four essentials to the successful te-ching ot this study. 
The first is endorsed text-books. By endorsed text- books I mean 
books prepared by the leading scientific men of this country, men 
and women. The publishing houses of the United States all publish 
these books and there is no monopoly, no text-book monopoly 
about it at all. There is nothing in it to me—not one cent—just a 
labor of love to me. Endorsed text-books adopted and graded, in 
the hands of the children just as in geography and arithmetic, and 
have oral lessons, in case the pupils are unable to read. Second, 
define it a place in the course of study and have regular work in 
this branch. The third is the same examination of pupils for pro- 
motion in this as in other studies; and, fourth, interested teachers. 
I speak from experience about the city school teachers of Nashville, 
They are ready to go into this work, and anxious to go into it. The 
teachers of this country are ready to do their part by this study. 
Whenever the school authorities shall put it into their course of 
study, when it becomes part of their regular work—the abomination 
of the alcoholic drink system of our country—it will result in the 
pupils having correct ideas about the nature of alcoholic drinks and 
they will learn the truth about these substances. That is all I have 
to say. I wish to say that I have sent out to the Superintendents 
of this State a Jarge number of lists of text-books, and I suppose 
those persons have received them, at least I hope they have. My 
idea was, if possible, to get these text-books into the public schools, 
and J would like to hear some expressions on this subject. 
Capt. Frank M. Smith: I think I can give some information on 
this subject. Action will be taken by all the counties in Tennessee. 
Some of the counties have acted already, and adopted a series of 
text-books in conformity to law. A1l the counties will take action, 
and the schools will open up with this course of study. So far as 
I know, I have heard of no opposition from any source whatever 
to the amendment to the school law. : , 
Mr. Chairman: I am not a teacher, nor a member of the Asso- 
ciation, but at the request of Mrs. Settle, of whose work I know in 
this regard, I come before you this morning to say something to 
the Association on the subject before them. I regard the action 
taken by the last General Assembly enacting this law as an im- 
portant une. The information Mrs. Settle desires is as to whether 
this course of study will be adopted or not by all the counties. I
-P-A-G-E-172
—171— 
am glad to hear what Prof. Smith says, and I very much hope 
that those of you who are here from counties that have not taken 
action on this question will see that your county does take action 
when you go home, and that those who are authorized to do so will 
go and see that the proper course of text-books are put into the 
school. As one that has spent some years in teaching, I feel quite 
sure that one of the greatest hopes of our country in regard to this 
great question is to be realized by the daily instruction of the pupils 
in the school. I think the Legislature has acted wisely, and I hope 
that the various school officers and teachers may be able to carry 
out their action. 
Prof. Goodman: Mr. President—I will say in regard to Mrs. 
Settle’s work, for the benefit of those who have never met her be- 
fore (those who have been in attendance on the Association before 
have met her), that her work does not consist simply in working 
before meetings of this kind, but through every day of the year, 
Mr. President, and I believe that for any laws that have been 
passed more credit is due to herself than to any other one person, 
and that at our Association, a year ago I believe it was, or perhaps 
two years ago, we unanimously passed a request to the Legislature 
to have this law enacted, and this is just one little evidence of the 
weight this Association’s recommendations have upon the Legis- 
lature, and no doubt good results will come of it asa p rt of our 
school work. 
Superintendent Ben. F. Jones: I am glad to assure Mrs. Settle, 
as Capt. Smith has already done, that so far as I am informed on 
the subject, there is no opposition, and it will be looked to promptly ; 
and, perhaps, as an example of what some of us in the district where 
they say we haye “ mountain dew” mean to do, I will say I intro- 
duced into my school this fall a work on this subject. Through the 
industry of one of our teachers, we put upon the blackboard daily 
for the little folks a copy of the lesson from one of the books, and 
into the more advanced classes I succeeded in getting together 
three text-books, and we put in about seven or eight weeks in the 
latter part of our term on the work, and our children liked it. I 
hope a reform may be made with many of our teachers, and, as one 
Superintendent, I will do what I can in my county. 
J. H. Allen: Mr. Chairman—The Public School Directors’ As- 
sociation of Bedford County, at the semi-annual meeting the 4th of
-P-A-G-E-173
—172— 
this month, appointed a committee to recommend and adopt, for 
uniform use in the county, a work on Hygiene and Poysiology, in 
keeping with the Act of the Legislature. The book will be adopted 
at our next semi-annu:l meeting in May, and go into our schools at 
the beginning of the summer term, 
Mrs. Settle: I would like to know if this Association under- 
stands that this law requires the teaching of this study to every pu- 
pil in the schools; that is, from tie little folks on up to the very 
highe-t grade—that every school in the public schools after January 
next shall receive this instruction? In the case of pupils that can- 
not read of course it will have to be taught orally ; in the case of 
pupils that can read the Superintendents and School Boards will 
have to make such arrangements as they deem best to comply with 
the law, and for this reason text-books will have to be introduced 
into the schools, and that is what I want to put before this Asso- 
ciation. Oue text-book in the school will not answer, as I under- 
stand the law. O/ course I do not construe the law to suit every- 
body, only as I-think it ought to be, and what has been done in 
other States. We could not get the Legislature to specify the text- 
books. We tried that, but that was left open, I suppose, for the 
School Directors of the counties, and that is what I want to put 
before this Association—what are understood to be the essentials for 
the successful study of Physiology and Hygiene, with special refer- 
ence to the nature of alcoholic drinks and narcotics,-—1st, That we 
have endorsed text-books; 2nd, a definite time and place in the 
course of study; 3rd, the same examination for pupils for promo- 
tion in this as in any other studies; and, 4th, the interested teacher. 
When you have the first three, you will get the other. In those 
places where the most successful teaching has been done they have 
adopted endorsed text-books, text-books that have been recom- 
mended and endorsed by the leading scientists of this country, both 
men and women. 
Prot. Henderson: Iam very glad this matter has been brought 
up, because I have been giving it some attention in our school. We 
have been teaching this subject for some time, but have been con- 
fining it to one grade of pupils; but I would construe the law the 
same as Mrs. Settle did a little while ago, that we would have to 
begin and teach this in each grade, and it has somewhat perplexed 
me. Now, understand me at the start, I am fully in sympathy with
-P-A-G-E-174
—173— 
this movement, and I think our children ought to be taught these 
things, but the perplexing problem is, How are we going to arrange 
it in our course of study? We have been quite unable to complete 
the course of study that is prescribed without adding to it a year, 
and when we get these extra studies what are we going to do with 
them? It seems to me the tendency has been to overload our pub- 
lic schools with studies. We have been given too many studies to 
be taught for the length of time we have to do it. Now, of course 
many of you understand that I am teaching what is known asa city 
graded school; we levy a special tax and have special privileges, 
and that being the case, we do not follow the course of study as they 
do in the county, but arrange our own course of study. If I un- 
derstand correctly this law, we have to include this subject in our 
course of study. If I understand it correctly, we are bound to 
teach this; and, if this be true, it is going to force me to re-arrange 
my entire course of study, and I am going to have to leave out 
something or else extend my time, because we are already full. 
How are we going to meet this? what are we going to do? This 
is the problem that perplexes me. I would like to hear someone 
on this subject, to see how you will meet it, so I may know how to 
meet it in my school. 
Superintendent McGee: I was going to state my own experience 
about this matter. From the first to the sixth grade, teach the sub- 
ject orally, the teachers having the text-books, and they making 
use’of them and putting upon the blackboard such instructions as 
wanted, and such as are desirable and adapted to the grade. After 
the sixth grade they can use text-books, but from the first to the 
sixth grade pupils have no text-books in their hands at all, and I 
use in those grades several different text-books; but after we have 
reached this grade we use a series of text-books, but tu avoid put- 
ting additional studies and additional text-books into the hands of 
the pupils themselves, from the sixth grade down we have no text- 
books at all, but the teachers give instructions orally. 
Prof. Henderson: I would like to ask if that will meet the re- 
quirements of the law? I would like to hear from Superintendent 
Gilbreath on this subject. Perhaps he can say a few words that 
will settle the whole matter and make it plain to us. 
Superintendent Gilbreath: Mr. President—That law to my mind 
is very clear, that Physiology, with special reference to narcotics,
-P-A-G-E-175
—174— 
cigarette smoking, alcoholic drinks, and their effects upon the hu- 
man system, shall be taught in the public schools simply as the 
_ other required branches. Take, for example, Geography. Geog- 
raphy is a required branch of study in every public school, and, 
like Physiology, must be taught as thoroughly as other branches in 
the course of study for public schools; but it does not mean in ev- 
ery school that every pupil must recite every day in Geography. It 
is simply made a requirement, and goes in the public course with 
the other branches. It is not necessary to teach it more thoroughly 
than other required branches, only as thoroughly as other required 
branches. It simply means it must be taught in the public schools, 
and that, before a student can pass from the primary to secondary 
schools and receive a certificate, or from a secondary school or 
graded school with a publie school diploma, he must be given in- 
struction in Physiology and Hygiene with special reference to this 
subject, and that it must be taught as thoroughly as Geography, or 
History, or any other of the required branches. I think that a 
careful reading makes it very plain that no special prominence is to 
be given to any particular branch of study in the course of the law 
in question, in connection with the section where the required 
branches are enumerated. 
Supt. W. E. Lumley: Let the teachers give the pupils instrue- 
tions in physiology, with special reference to these subjects. It is 
right that this study should receive a place in our course, but do 
not give the pupils the text-books until after they have completed 
United States History. In this way we are relieved from all this 
difficulty and pressure for time, and in my judgment this furnishes 
the answer to this requirement under the law. I desire to be in= 
formed upon this question. It has been my practice for years to 
devote, we will say, two lessons a week to that. subject; to have a 
period set apart in each room each time for the discussion of this 
question. 
Superintendent Wright: I appreciate the remarks made by Prof. 
McGee and Prof. Henderson. The fourth and fifth grades of our 
schools are already very full, and they cannot be made any fuller, 
and if we can be allowed to teach this orally until we get through 
the primary grades, I think it would be the best thing we can do. 
I think the oral instruction until the sixth grade, where it properly 
comes in, is the best plan to teach it.
-P-A-G-E-176
—175— 
Superintendent Hayes: There is another way, and I have been 
thinking of it, and that is, when a child in one of the readers has 
become tired of the reader, give him one of these easier works on . 
Physiology and Hygiene as a supplementary reader. I think that 
will answer Superintendent Henderson’s question. Put into their 
hands a well-writen book on a subject like this and they will go 
right to work and simply devour it. No use to keep them any six 
weeks on some of the smaller books; six weeks on any of them 
would be ample. 
Superintendent Pardue : One advantage embraced in the position 
Superintendent Hayes has outlined is this: If there is any period 
of the child’s life he should receive this instruction it is right in the 
primary grade. From what thought I have given this subject, I 
think we ought to teach this in the primary grade. Very often we 
find the most inveterate cigarette smokers are boys in the fifth or 
sixth grade. It would not be so easy to reform them along at 
that stage as it probably would be to teach them the evil of it 
sooner. As I understand this law, I don’t think it was intended 
for us to wait until the boy was nearly ready to quit the public 
school, and maybe by that time smoking poisonous cigarettes. I 
don’t think that is the proper thing to do; I think we should begin 
the work immediately ; that we should embrace this teaching in the 
primary grades and text-books. 
Superintendent Goldsby: I have in my school twelve grades, and, 
like Mr. Henderson, if I have to run it through every grade, I 
ehall have to cut out something. Our schools are in a very crowded 
condition. Mr. Henderson and I have compared our courses of 
study, and we find that there are some things we would like to have 
in our course of study and have taught iv the country schools, but 
what is the poor teacher to do in a country school, with about 
twenty-five or thirty recitations a day, if he has to instruct every 
grade in the school on this subject? I ask for information; I want 
to know what to do about it; whether we are expected to take the 
schools and have a special text-book from the sixth grade on up, or 
have a text-book in the sixth grade like we do physiology, on 
through the eighth grade, and not quit until we carry them to that; 
or by lecture or outline or something through the primary course 
until we get to the sixth grade, and then, after a one year’s course, 
to drop it out, that is the question ; whether we are to keep on, year
-P-A-G-E-177
  —176— 
after year, in all the grades? I would like for somebody to answer 
that question. 
Superintendent McGee: In the primary schools where the teach- 
er has only the primary grade to teach, and only one, that teacher 
is assigned that duty, and, a little later, the teacher in the next 
grade, ete. This matter can be gotten over easily. These teachers 
teach the children about plants, etc., and thus give them a little 
oral instruction in natural science every day, and they do that, and 
I suppose do it in all schools. This very naturally comes in in con- 
nection with the course in language The children are constantly 
instructed, and as they grow older, when they come to study the 
geography of the island of Cuba, one of the products is tobacco 
and another rum, and they are laid down in the geography as ex- 
ports, and in this way give them lessons. This we can keep up un- 
til the pupils reach a point—the seventh grade—where they study 
Physiology ; the seventh and eighth grades lay that down as a 
study. I think the remarks of Prof. Gilbreath cover the case ex- 
actly. Part of the instruction they receive in the primary grade, 
and part in other grades, just as in the case of geography, and arith- 
metic, or anything else. I do not see that this necessarily over- 
crowds our public school work. 
Capt. Frank M. Smith: Let us look at this question a little. 
Prof. McGee looks at it from a sixth-grade standpoint, and he does 
not know that there are only about eight hundred schools in Ten- 
nessee that have a sixth grade, out of the seven thousand schools— 
I can bear witness to that; and he does not know that a great ma- 
jority of the pupils of Tennessee never do see the sixth grade. 
These are facts, or else the statistics themselves make a falsehood of 
it. Iam not talking to you in reference to any text-books; I am 
interested in this subject, and have been all along the line. Now, 
let us go back and look at it as I see it, and I will try to make it 
plain to you. The law requires that it shall be taught as thoroughly. 
Now, that requirement must be met, or you fail to comply with the 
law. Prof. Hayes has told you that it can be taught as a supple- 
mentary reader. I want to make this assertion, that where it has 
been tried as a supplementary reader it has been found to be per- 
fectly satisfactory. Of course you cannot put this into use at once ; 
all the schools, you may say, will not try it, but mark my prediction 
made to-day, that the time is not far distant when it will be taught,
-P-A-G-E-178
—177— 
when the schools are all engaged in the work, and the books are 
graded just as the readers are graded. Each of the series, so far as 
I know, are graded, and intended to be used as supplementary 
readers, following the Second Reader. When a pupil has com- 
pleted the Second Reader, or has read the Second Reader—it is not 
necessary even to read, I think, the Second Reader—they can read 
all these litle primers. These represent the different series you 
could adopt ; you have them before you. I suppose each publish- 
ing house in the United States has furnished a series 0! text-books ; 
you ean select from that series. You would recommend to the di- 
rectors that they select one that could be readily taught. De- 
cidedly this will be a great benefit to you, and to our teachers. I 
make this statement, that in the seven thousand primary schools in 
the State of Tennessee, if you undertake to teach that subject 
orally, it will not be taught. You can put it into the hands of the 
children ; you can give it to the teacher, for it has been prepared 
for him by the very best minds in the country. Iam not prepared 
to teach it orally ; you are not prepared to teach it orally. There 
are not five persons in this heuse that can teach it orally as well, 
no, nothing like as well, as one of these little primers will teach it. 
Now, suppose they are put into the hands of the Second Reader pu- 
pils—it is properly authorized to come in there—or, if he has passed. 
through the Third Reader, there is a little book that will fit 
that work exactly, and when you have passed it through the 
fifth grade you have complied with the law, because you have had 
it in one, two, or three grades, and have given those pupils a 
knowledge of the effects of alcohol that they never will receive in 
any other way, in my opinion. If you will do this, you have com- 
plied with the law, there is no question about that ; and then you 
have not extended your curriculum, so far as putting in any extra 
studies is concerned, and you have given a good teacher employ- 
ment——it will never be taught without that—and you have com- 
plied with the law, and the fifth grade pupils have a knowledge of 
this subject—pupils that, unless there is some way to increase the 
number of our secondary schools, never will reach the sixth grade. 
H. D. Huffaker: I want, first, to most heartily endorse the ac- 
tion of the Legislature in placing physiology in our course, and I 
want, further, to endorse, Superintendent Gilbreath’s ruling as to 
the meaning of this law, and want to state, further, that I believe 
12
-P-A-G-E-179
—173— 
this is one of the most important branches to be taught in the pri- 
mary schools and that there is nothing we can teach that will be 
more beneficial to the rising generation than to teach them the bane- 
ful effects of alcoholic drinks, cigarette smoking, ete. I believe 
now that teachers have an instrument in their hands by which they 
can more thoroughly reach the children and teach them these things 
than ever before, and I want to heartily endorse it in toto. I be- 
lieve, furthermore, that it can be taught to them, and taught with- 
out extending the course of study in any sense or in any way. 
There are two ways by which it can be done, both of which have 
been mentioned, as a supplementary reader used alternately with 
the readers, and I believe that plan will work. I can see no reason 
why we cannot teach it, and a great many why we should. I want 
to say now, if we could not do it in any other way, we had better 
leave the Second Reader out and put a primary physiology in its 
place. There is nothing we can do that will do more good than to 
teach this thoroughly and systematically. I do not believe that we 
can afford to wait for it until we reach the sixth grade. As has 
been said, so few pupils ever see the sixth grade that it will amount 
to nothing unless we can apply it to the primary grades. I believe 
it can be done successfully, at least we have decided to try it in 
Hamilton County, and have adopted two physiologies for the pri- 
mary schools, and.expect to use them as secondary readers, and my 
teachers are worrying the life out of me because I have not got the 
text-books in the schools. Our children are pushing me up about 
the books. 
Superintendent Jackson—Mr. Chairman: A. great many things 
are good; beefsteak is good, but if you will give it to.a man six or 
eight times a day, and seven days in the week, he might get too 
much, I do not understand that we are to teach this branch five 
days in the week, and in the different grades in the primary schools. 
I do not so understand the meaning of the law. We teach lan- 
guage; we take up the subject in the second grade and teach it 
orally, language and the meaning of language, and a.man who un- 
derstands his bnsiness can do this without a book. I don’t know 
how it is in other counties, but we find it rather difficult in the 
country districts to get the patrons to purchase books. Now, if 
you begin it in the second grade you have four books. I don’t 
consider that at all necessary. The fact of the business is, I think if
-P-A-G-E-180
i 
we undertake to teach it too much they will get tired of it. There 
is such a thing as duing too much, and I don’t think it will be 
necessary to have it in every grade. Ibelieve you can combine 
the grades as we do in other things and give lessons. Take the first 
second and third grades and give lessons, orally. It certainly would 
be a difficult thing to get four or five extra books into the primary 
schools. I believe, however, there should be at least one or two 
books adopted by ihe primary schools. I believe every County 
Superintendent in the State will do his duty in this matter, and’ call 
his directors together and adopt « book or books in the primary 
schools, and in this way they will comply with the public school law 
in these primary grades. I believe the necessary instruetions will 
be given, and these books can be stndied by the teachers if they 
don’t know anything about the effects of alcohol, cigarettes, ete. 
Superiniendent Brown: This diseussion marks an important 
epoch in Tennessee in the public schools of the State—teaching the 
subject of physiology, with special reference to the effects of alco- 
holic drinks avd narcotics upon the human system. Well, there 
have been.a few who have been disposed, it seemed to me, to inti+ 
mate that it was not:so very essential to tesch it to the children be- 
fore they reached the secondary schools. Iwant to disabuse any- 
body’s mind. As Capt. Smith has already suid, I live in the coun- 
try, and I know what country schools are. I know very little 
about city schools, but in the country schools of the State—if we 
undertake to teach this subject simply in the secondary schools 
without making it a primary study—the object of the law will no 
doubt. prove a failure ; and we had just as well undertake to teach 
geography until the fifth grade shall have completed it, without 
books in any sense at all, as to undertake to teach the subject of 
physiology without books to the small children. My idea abont 
this subject is, that we have to confine ourselves to the books for 
the third, fourth and fifth grades just simply as we do to the subject 
of geography, or of grammar, or of arithmetic. We can teach 
avithmetic—numbers—without books, but who would think of fin- 
ishing the fifth grade without books in the hands of the pupils? 
Last year Mrs. Settle presented this matter to this Association, and 
there were several then in favor of it; and I am as heartily in fa- 
vor of it now as I was then, and I believe it marks an epoch in the 
history of Tennessee that will be fraught with much good to the fu-
-P-A-G-E-181
—-180-— 
ture. There are teachers in Tennessee that may feel a little deli- 
eacy on this question; I hope there may be none, but I know 
how popular opinion is. I care nothing for popular opinion upon 
this subject. I am in favor of this law, and of teaching this subject 
and using books in our schools, teaching it in the primary schools 
as well as in the secondary scbools. 
Supt. Hayes: Tne question of buying books is the ouly quesiion, 
T am satisfied ; that is the way in our schools. If used as supple- 
mentary readers, we bave a right to demand these books. We can 
do that, and this law gives the teachers the right to do that. They 
can demand of the people these books. Instead of stretching out 
this teaching through the whole course of study as has been sug- 
gested, let us have it for six weeks in one grade, and we will com- 
ply with the law fully, and not tire our students with it, either. 
A Member: Mr. Chairman, I don’t think this should be made 
supplementary to any study, reading or any other, but should have 
its place. Some one has spoken of having the work in two series ; 
as a matter of course, two series will not do for all the grades ; 
besides, if you use it as a supplementary reader in all grades, you 
will do away with other supplementary reading. It ought to havea 
place in the curriculum—in the sixth or fourth grade—as a complete 
subject, as much so as any other branch. 
Supt. Overall: There is one point still not mentioned, and that is, 
the age at which the pupil is most likely to be lead off into these 
habits. You will find that the children take to smoking cigarettes 
very early, and you want to get at the child before it does this in 
order to prevent it, and then you will havea moral child. It strikes 
me the question of development of character enters into this subject 
forcibly. At what age the child should commence to proceed in 
the right direction. From my observation in the school-room you 
will find children from nine to twelve years old smoke. They 
think it looks manly, and want to be like the big boys in school. 
Secondly, I say in the primary work is the place to begin the study. 
I like the idea of having it as a supplementary reader; besides, in 
learning reading, as you know, the child has to go through the 
Second Reader several! times, or through several second readers, be- 
fore they are thoroughly able to go into the Third Reader, and why 
not put a supplementary reader in, in the way of a physiology, and 
Jet them Jeirn to read from this supplementary reader, and then
-P-A-G-E-182
—181— 
use the book in the other grades wherever the hardness of the study 
or the book you have in the school will place it? 
J. H. Allen: Mr. Chairman, we seem to regard this subject as 
entirely new. The truth is, there is not a man in this house, no 
matter how gray his head nor how many years have been added to 
his life, who has not been taught the evil effects of tobacco and al- 
cohol—the use of tobacco in all of its forms, not only in all the 
grades of his school life, but in the daily walks of life. Iam glad 
that the subject has taken a new feature in our State, that the law 
provides for text-book instruction on the subject. The law gives 
the school authoritses the privilege of saying when the subject shall 
be taught. I have never heard a subject discussed that gave a 
greater variety of opinions than this one has. Some’ one has men- 
tioned as high as four grades of supplementary reading. There is 
no necessity for such a course; there is no reason why we should 
undertake to teach the evil effects of cigarette smoking like we 
would teach reading or the subject of mathematics. The most fa- 
vurable time for teaching the injurious effects of stimulants is be- 
fore the child has formed the habit of using them. This requires 
that teaching begin very early in life. It must be oral until the 
child is qualified to use the text-book in the primary grades. At 
this age the subject should be thoroughly taught with a view to 
avoiding the formation of the habits. We can have little hope of 
reforming this generation. We need to set ourselves to the task of 
raising up a generation that will not need to be reformed. Then, 
as early as the child is able to understand the text-book under con- 
sideration, it should be put in his hands and thoroufihly taught, and 
passed as other subjects. 
Prof. Henderson: I move that the discussion now close. 
Superintendent Tomlinson: What was the intention of the Leg- 
islature in passing this law? Now, we had in our secondary schools 
physiology and hygiene taught to all of our pupils, and it was not 
necessary for the Legislature to pass a law in reference to this in the 
secondary schools ; therefore I take it, the motive that induced the 
Legislature to pass this law was to get it into the primary schools. 
Now, to get it into the primary schools, how is it to be taught 
there? It is left to us—where is it to be introduced, in which 
_grade? It is left to the directors, the superintendents and directors 
of the various counties. I have been talking to the State Superin-
-P-A-G-E-183
—182— 
    tendent this morning how to get at it. Talk about the ordinary 
country teacher teaching it by lectures—they would not make more 
than two or three lectures in the session. We have to have text- 
hooks, and we have to say where these text-books are to come in. 
We must have it in our curriculum as a full course, and the only 
way to do this is to use it as a supplementary reader. It will an- 
swer all purposes as a reader, and in learning to read they will learn 
this. I feel that I am obligated to call our directors together and 
adopt books, and I feel it is my duty {o see that there isa text-book 
adopted, and that it is applicable to a certain grade or course. Ido 
not think it is necessasy to have it through all the course and get 
the children disgusted with it, but two or three grades, say the third 
and fourth, maybe, or the third, fourth and fifth grades—the sixth 
strikes the secondary grades. I think that is the proper way to get 
at it. 
Superintendent Ben. F. Jones: Mr. President—I believe it was 
Horace, when a mother came to him and asked him when she 
should begin to teach her boy, asked, How oldiis your child? She 
replied, Two years, and he said, That is two years lost. I have a 
little boy only four years old, and the other day I saw him masti- 
eating fodder, and he said it was tobacco—he was chewing it. You 
talk of cigarette smoking, and my friend speaks of the country 
teacher. J ama mountain man, and I want to say that nine-tenths 
of our children would hardly know a cigarette. I am glad our law 
does not s1y just to teach about cigarette smoking. I wish my boy 
could never see smoke from a pipe. Let us teach our children to he 
men, Why don’t we talk about cigars and about plug tobacco ? 
Let us quit it if we use it, and let us be men, and teach that with- 
out text-books ; that is the higher way to give the child this instruc- 
tion. Let us be men, that these boys and girls, impelled by our 
example, may grow up to be grand men and women. Tet us quit 
using tobacco ; let us teach by precept; let us be men. 
The discussion was closed. 
After calling over the various committees to report in the after- 
noon session, the Association, on motion, adjourned until 2:30 P.w. 
AFTERNOON SESSION. 
The Association met pursuant to adjournment, and was called to | 
order by the President, at 3 P.M.

Capt. W. R. Garrett: Mr. President, I am instructed by the 
Committee on Teaching of Tennessee History to present their re- ° 
port. This report is signed by all of the members present. We 
have made the report of the committee of the Legislature a part of 
this report for two reasons: One is, that it is a very able report and 
shows the cordial sentiments of the Legislature, and also, we think 
it a report deserving to be placed on our records. This report was 
drawn by Capt. Jas. H. Bate, who was appointed chairman of the 
sub-committee, to whom the matter was referred, and was adopted 
by the full joint committee of both houses of the Legislature. 
Nasuviuue, TENN., December 10, 1895. 
To the President and Members of the Public School Officers’ Association: 
1. We, your Committee on Teaching History, have the honor to 
report that we have examined the school laws of the State, and we 
think that ample provision is made for teaching history in the 
schools, except that some provision should be made for teaching 
the general history of all American countries. The amendments 
to the school law of 1891 provide for teaching general history— 
United States history and Tennessee history. We think that it is 
important that the historical course should include the study of 
general American history, on a plan similar to that by which the 
general history of European nations is now taught. 
2. We believe that the instruction given in United States history 
has undergone a marked improvement. during the past few years, 
but there is still room for improvement, and we recommend that 
the school officers give to this subject especial attention. We be- 
lieve that the History of Tennessee is hetter and more extensively 
taught than formerly. Our teachers are becoming more familiar 
with the subject, and have improved their methods of teaching it, 
We are informed, however, that the subject is omitted in many 
schools in which it is required, by law, to be taught. We recom- 
mend that this Association pass resolutions urging every school in 
the State to teach the History of Tennessee. 
Your committee further report that they are informed that a 
eommittee was appointed by this Association, at its last meeting, to 
petition the General Assembly of Tennessee to establish in one of 
our colleges or universities the chair of American history, in order 
to provide a higher course in American history, and to pave the
-P-A-G-E-185
e1g425 
way for the more complete and efficient study of history in our 
schools, and especially for the development of the History of Ten- 
nessee. This committee, to which your present committee are suc- 
cessors, appeared before the Educational Committee of the last 
General Assembly and presented the views of this Association. 
They were cordially received by the General Assembly, as will 
appear from the action of the Assembly, and more fully from the 
following report of the joint committee on education, which was 
fully indorsed by the General Assembly, as expressing the senti- 
ments of that honorable body : 
REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE. 
“As a suitable preface to the recommendation which your com- 
mittee present below, and which they earnestly urge the General 
Assembly to adopt, it may not be out of place to refer to the great 
store of historical wealth which lies hidden in tradition, in scattered 
records, in unpublished manuscripts, and in the memories of a few 
old pioneers, who stil! linger here and there in the beautiful valleys 
and the majestic mountains of Tennessee. It may be truly said 
that her sons have been grand factors in making the history of this 
country, but have been too modest to record their own heroism. 
We, their posterity, owe it to the memory of our heroic ancestors to: 
rescue their memories from oblivion. Many of her sons who en- 
tered upon the national arena have performed deeds which will live 
forever upon the pages of general history. Those who have de- 
voted their lives and talents to’ the service of the State deserve 
from their own people the preservation of their great deeds. Be- 
sides, the State is interested in preserving the proud history of the 
achievements of its masses. The people make the State. Shall} 
such events as the Indian wars and King’s Mountain be longer 
ignored? Shall we sit idly by and see our children grow up with- 
out ever knowing the great part taken by their ancestors in the 
Floridian and Mexican wars? Shall they have no instruction in 
the events and causes which molded the character and developed 
the institutions of Tennessee? Our children should know more 
than may be gleaned from the meager accounts of the school histo- 
ries about the heroism of the ‘Rear-guard of the Revolution,” 
which, under Sevier and Shelby, fought at King’s Mountain one of 
the decisive battles of the world, resulting in the subsequent cap-
-P-A-G-E-186
—185— 
ture of Cornwallis at Yorktown. They should know that John 
Sevier fought thirty-five battles, and was thirty-five times a con- 
queror; they should know about Andrew Jackson’s struggles as a 
boy, about his noble and patriotic mother, and how she molded his 
character to the highest style of citizenship and heroism. They 
should learn how he secured for the United States Alabama, Missis- 
sippi and Florida, and defeated the veterans of Wellington at New 
Orleans, and placed on the pages of history the most successful 
administration of the United States. They should be familiar with 
the names and deeds of Houston, Coffee, Armstrong, Carroll, 
Trousdale, Pillow, Polk, Jones, Felix Grundy, Jvln Bell, and our 
long list of heroes and statesmen. Thucydides wrote of Pericles, 
otherwise the matchless oratory of that princely Athenian would 
not now survive to charm our age and time. Yet, who shall per- 
form a like office for our orators and statesmen ? 
“Take away from the map of the United States all that territory 
acquired by Tennesseans—Jackson, Polk and Johnson—and the 
remainder will be a ‘pent up Utica.’ Boone’s movement to settle 
Kentucky originated with the settlers of Watauga, and the pur- 
chase by the Transylvania Company was made of the Cherokees 
upon Tennessee soil. 
“In Athens, it is said that there was a law making it obligatory 
upon the State to set up in the public graves, and along the high- 
ways, statu'es of her eminent men. The youths of Athens were to 
these as an incidental to stimulate them to emulate actions of her 
great men. This was an impressive way to teach history, and, as a 
result, Athens became illustrious. 
“Tennessee should profit by this example. Our schools do much 
teaching by precept. Let us do some teaching by example. Let 
us, before it is too late, gather the jewels of our history, and put 
them in our own setting. Let us make the precious casket which 
contains them an object-lesson for our children. There are three 
things necessary to the greatness and glory of a State. These are: 
First, to make history; second, to write history; third, to teach 
history. Our ancestors have mide history, our people are still 
making history. Let us write it and teach it, let us use it as an 
object-lesson to elevate and ennoble our children. The State is 
spending over $2,000,000 for education in ihe public schools. Is it 
not wise to spend a smal] amount to give that education a direction
-P-A-G-E-187
—186— 
which will be useful and valuable to the State? The thing now 
most needed in our educational system is to give more attention and 
judicious direction to the study of American history, and especially 
to'the study of Tennessee history. 
“Jn their recent visit to the Peabody Normal College, your com- 
mittee was strongly impressed when they saw before them more 
than five- hundred intelligent young men and women, of whom 
over ninety per cent. are Tennesseans, preparing themselves to en- 
ter upon the work of teaching. They will go into every part of 
the South to engage in this noble work. If each of these’shall 
secure a school of fifty pupils, their work will reach annually 25,000 
children, and will be widely distributed over the entire South, and 
especially will reach every portion of Tennessee. No means can 
be found which will more rapidly and effectively reach the coming 
generation. Examining into the financial management, your com- 
mittee was struck with the economical and wise administration, and 
were especially pleased to note that Chancellor Payne, although 
pressed for money, and with an annual deficit of $2,000 per annum 
pending, had decided, on account of the stringency of the times, 
not ask for an additional appropriation. Chancellor Payne makes 
the following summary of the situation: 
“1. With the continued growth of the college, and the corre- 
sponding increzse of expenditures, there will be an annual deficit of 
$2,000.’ 
««2. If the present appropriation of $15,000 be continued, and 
an additional appropriation of $5,000 per annum be given, I could 
establish the chair of American history at $3,000, and meet the 
deficit that is accruing at present rate of expenses.’ 
¢3. If $10,000 additional per annum is allowed, we could have 
what is embraced in proposition two and add two or three additional 
teachers to the faculty, and increase the salaries of three or four of 
our present teachers who are teaching for comparatively small sala- 
ries, and who have been offered largely increased salaries elsewhere, 
and whom we will loose sooner or later if we do not add something 
to their present salaries.’ 
“Tn the opinion of the committee there is an opportunity to 
earry out a plan which has been long urged and cherrished by 
many of the best men in Tennessee, viz., to place the teaching of 
 
-P-A-G-E-188
—187— 
the History of Tennessee upon a judicious and sure foundation. 
Your committee therefore recommend and urge : 
“1, That the usnal appropriation of $15,000 per annum be given 
to the Peabody Normal College. 
“2. That an additional appropriation of $5,000 per annum be 
appropriated to the Peabody Normal College, which shall be used 
as follows: $2,000 for the general expenses of the college, $3,000 
for the support of the chair of American history, to be applied to 
the salary of the occupant of the chair and to the expenses of 
original] investigation, the accumulation and care of historical ma- 
terial, and the purchase of manuscripts and books. Said chair to 
be devoted to the history of the United States and of the Ameri- 
can continent, and to give especial attention to the history of Ten- 
messeee. J. H. Bate, 
“Chairman Sub-committee.” 
The General Assembly made provision for establishing the chair 
of American history at the Peabody Normal College. This chair 
was organized in June, 1895. The following wise provisions for 
its organization will be seen from the following announcement by 
Chancellor Payne: 
“Since the publication of the last annual catalogue of this in- 
stitution, the Legislature of Tennessee has established at the Pea- 
body Normal College, the chair of American history. This chair 
will embrace the following divisions of work, viz.: Class instruction, 
the accumulation of historical material, original historical investi- 
gation, and historical publication. The class instruction for the 
easuing year will embrace two courses, which will be elective: 
“Course No. 1, History of Tennessee, will occupy the first 
semester, and will be taught three hours in each week. The sub- 
ject will be taught topically, partly by lecture and partly by text- 
book. A course of parallel reading will be prescribed, and a 
course of investigation and discussion of topics assigned. Instrue- 
tion will also be given in drawing historical maps and charts, and 
in preparing historical tables, outlines, ete. f 
“Course No. 2, United States History, will oceupy the second 
semester, and be taught three hours per week. The instruction will 
constitute an advanced course in the history of the United States, 
embracing the constitutional, political, social, and geographical his-
-P-A-G-E-189
—188— 
tory of our country. The subject will be taught topically, partly 
by lecture and partly by text-book. A course of parallel reading 
will be prescribed, and a course of investigation and discussion of 
topics assigned. Instruction will also be given in drawing histor- 
ical maps and charts, and in preparing historical tables, outlines, ete. 
“Tn addition to the above courses, a course in general American 
history will be hereafter announced, to begin with the session of 
189697. This course will embrace the history of all American 
nations, their development and international relations.” 
In addition to the above regulations, Chancellor Payne decided 
to establish a historical magazine as the medium of puplication, to 
be under the immediate supervision of the chair of American his- 
tory. The character of this publication is shown in the following 
extract from its prospectus: 
“This magazine will serve as the medium for disseminating the 
information obtained through the researches which have been insti- 
tuted by the chair of American history, and which will be directed 
to reviving neglected facts of history, to correcting misrepresenta- 
tions of historical writers, and to presenting historical facts hitherto 
unpublished. While the work of this chair will extend to the 
entire field of United States histury, and to the history of the 
various nations of America, especial attention will be devoted to 
the rich mine of Tennessee history. In this field the co-operation 
of the Tennessee Historical Society, and valuable documente in the 
library of the college, will enable the magazine to offer to its read- 
ers much valuable and interesting information never before pub- 
lished. 
“A collection of the letters and papers of General James Rob- 
ertson, the Father of Middle Tennessee, bound in manuscript, and 
filling two large volumes, is among the treasures of the college 
library. These letters contain much valuable historical informa- 
tion, and have never been published. They will be presented to 
the public in the pages of this magazine, and these letters alone are 
well worth the price of the magazine. Special attention will be 
devoted to the genealogy of the men and women who have contrib- 
uted to the development of Tennessee and other States of the 
Union. The pages of the magazine will be enlivened by many 
 
-P-A-G-E-190
—189— 
gems of literature which have heretofore Jaid dormant in manu- 
script, or have received only local circulation. Among those who 
have engaged to contribute articles to the magazine are many of 
the ablest and best known writers of the South.” 
In consideration of the above, your committee presents the fol- 
lowing resolution, and moves its adoption: 
“Resolved, That this Association urges upon the school officers 
and teachers of Tennessee to give especial attention to the teaching 
of United States history, and to see to it that the History of Ten- 
nessee is taught in every school in the State, and we recommend 
that map-drawing and other illustrations be used in connection with 
the teaching of history.” Respectfully submitted, 
W. R. Garrett, 
L. A. Watkins, 
J. P. Rippry, 
8. A. Linx. 
I know it would be a pleasure to the Association to hear some 
report from the Legislature and their views of it from Mr. T. Leigh 
Thompson. 
The Chairman: The question before the Association is on the 
adoption of the report. I am sure the Association would be glad 
to hear from Mr. Thompson. 
Mr. Thompson: Mr. Chairman—My heart and mind are both 
heartily and sincerely interested in the work of Tennessee history. 
I do not know that I would say anything more in regard to the 
feelings existing in the mind of the last Legislature than is con- 
tained in the report which has just been read, and its adoption by - 
the Assembly. I would like, however, to emphasize the results, or 
the importance of the results, which is now assigned to this body. 
I do not believe there is another State in the Union that has a 
greater history, or the influence of which has been greater than that 
of Tennessee. In the early settlement of this State there were 
deeds done and there were influences set in motion that have af- 
fected the legislation and civilization of almost the entire western 
country of the United States; and in reading and studying the his- 
tory of Sevier, Robertson, and those early patriots and heroes, one is 
reminded of the old Grecian heroes, men who valued their coun- 
try’s good above every other consideration in life. If there were
-P-A-G-E-191
—190— 
any patriots in America that were real patriots and real heroes, E 
believe they lived in the early settlement of the State of Tennessee, 
and my attention has been called to the fact that the acts and deeds 
of these men are almost unknown to the people of the State. It is 
absolutely astonishing to realize how little Tennessee citizens know 
about the early history of our great State, and it was this consid- 
eration that the General Assembly had‘in mind that caused them 
to establish this Chair of American History at the Peabody Nor- 
mal College, with the express purpose of having a thorough, com+ 
plete and exhaustive history of these men wrilten, and also im-' 
pressing upon the teachers themselves the importance of teaching 
the rising generation the history «nd lives of these great men; and 
I wish to say that there was nothing before the last General Assem- 
bly that met with a more hearty and cordial! consideration than this. 
report that Capt. Garrett has just read. It was, you might say, 
enthusiatically received, and I believe that this Associution of teach- 
ers and school officers will give their personal attention to this mat- 
ter, that the teachers of Tennessee will take hold of this subject, 
and it will be only a few years when Tennessee history will. be 
known throughout the length and breadth of the State, and. we will 
be proud of our State and our people, and Tennessee will enter up- 
on a new era of educational advancement. I wish to say hefore I 
take my seat that there has nothing happened recently that. has 
given me more pleasure than the tact, that Capt. Garrett has been 
selected to take charge of this great.and important work. I:believe 
he is the right man in the right place, and. I believe that it is the 
duty of every member of this Association to take particular pains 
to look up all historical manuscripts and all historical. facts, and 
make it a point.to have those papers deposited at the Peabody Nor- 
mal College, or where he will have access to them in. this work. of 
historical research. I know that there are a great many historical 
papers of value scattered throughout the length and breadth of the 
State. Ihave made inquiries, and find there are a great many, val- 
uable papers, something like autobiographies, in the families of a 
great many people, and frequently those people themselves do not 
know they have such valuable manuscripts in their possession. 
Now, I say it is the duty of every member of this Association. to 
look these matters up, and to have them placed where they can be 
obtained and published by Capt. Garrett in this Historical. Maga-
-P-A-G-E-192
—-191— 
zine. Unless we give him our cordial support, and’ unless he re- 
céives tlie hearty support of every member of this Association, and 
all the teachers and citizens of this State, it will be impossible for 
him to carry out the object of the establishment of this Chair of 
American History. And, in conclusion, I wish simply to say, or 
repeat, rather, that next year is our centennial year. It closes the 
first hundred years of our history as a State, and particularly it is 
the duty of every one now to bring out every historical matter pos- 
sible; and I wish it was possible some means could be provided — 
whereby every child of the State of Tennessee could have the op- 
portunity next year of reading some Tennessee history. This is 
only, Mr. President, a passing thought in my mind, realizing, as I 
do, that there are a great many people, children of families in the 
State of Tennessee, who are not able to buy a history, but the fact 
that almost all families take their county newspapers, the idea has 
occurred to me that if we could have a history of Tennessee pub- 
lished in every county paper in this State during our centennial 
year, where every family and every child, by simply subseribing for 
the county paper, can obtain a history of the State, it would be one 
of the greatest things that could be done for the educational inter- 
ests of this State. I do not know whether it is practicable, but I 
say if such thing could be done, we would: lay before our children 
in this State a history of the deeds and great events in our State’s 
history ; and if this idea should: be considered by your body, or 
anyone else, I assure you I shall: give my very hearty support to- 
wards carrying out any such thing as that, if it is possible. (Ap- 
plause.) 
The President: The question before the Association is the adop- 
tion of the report. 
On taking the vote the report was adopted by the Association. 
Superintendent Gilbreath: I have here a report from the Univer- 
sity of Tennessee, submitted by T. C. Karns, for the President. 
The President: Without objection, Superintendent Gilbreath 
will read the report of the University of Tennessee. 
REPORT FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE TO THE PUBLIC 
SCHOOL OFFICERS’ CONVENTION, IN SESSION AT 
NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE. 
With regard to the University of Tennessee for the fall term of 
1895-96, the President directs me to report as follows:
-P-A-G-E-193
e192 
Notwithstanding the great financial depression, the attendance at 
the university continues good. The total enrollment in the Aca- 
demic, Teachers’ and Law departments reaches 235. The work of 
the institution is prosperous, the students seem well satisfied, and 
the prospect is that nearly all will continue with us through the 
year. 
The government of the institution is of a paternal character, be- 
ing in charge of the dean. ‘The students are treated as other citi- 
~ gens, and the results are found to be far better than when the insti- 
tution was under military discipline. The old friction and antag- 
onism toward the faculty have disappeared. Outbreaks and violent 
disorder are things of the past. Of course, we still retain military 
drill, as required by the geneneral government. This affords ex- 
cellent physical exercise, but is obligatory only two classes, the 
Freshman and Sophomore. 
The work on the college farm and the general experiments in ag- 
riculture are carried on as usual. A number of young men are 
awarded apprenticeships in this department and have constant 
practice in dairying and general farm work, for which they are paid 
each about $100 a year. Only a portion of their time, of course, 
is employed in work, the rest being devoted to their regular studies. 
For their accommodation a new building has recently been erected 
on the farm at a cost of $5,000. It has steam heat and other 
modern conveniences. Rooms are furnished free of rent. The 
young men of the State have thus a fine opportunity for obtaining 
an education in scientific agriculture. 
Forty-two students are taking the mechanical courses, and have 
practical work in the shops, where they are instructed in the various 
arts of wood and iron work, including blacksmithing, turning, ma- 
chine work, ete. Industrial drawing is a prominent feature. Three 
apprentices in this department receive about $100 each per year. 
Others are employed in caring for the electric light plant and other 
work. With us the object of industrial education is not so much 
to give training in simple trades as to make intelligent and educated 
masters of industry. While the primary object of the university is - 
training in the sciences pertaining to agriculture and the mechanie 
arts, literary and classical studies are by no means neglected. The 
various schools in these lines are being constantly strengthened and 
built up.
-P-A-G-E-194
—193— 
The law department is meeting with marked success. The at- 
tendance this year is larger than ever before, and the prospect is 
good for a still greater increase. 
The teachers’ department is also duing good work. Most of those 
who take this work attend during the sprisg term after having 
taught in the fall. Nearly all of the students who were with us 
last year have good positions and doing well in their work. Peda- 
gogics is also made elective in the Senior year, and is taken by 
those members of the class who wish to prepare for teachers. 
It is gratifying to be able to report favorably with regard to the 
action of the trustees in admitting women. Thirty-nine have been 
admitted this fall. The young women who come to us are of the 
very best class, being almost without exception very studious and 
earnest in their work. They have the same requirements as the 
young mex, and stand equally well in their classes. They have 
taken fifty per cent. of the honors during the past two years. 
With regard to general matters, it may be mentioned that we 
have now provided means for living suitable to all conditions. 
Most of the male students board in the co-operative club, at a cost 
of $2 per week, and lodge in the university dormitories. Un- 
furnished rooms in private houses may be had at from $1.50 up, and 
furnished rooms from $4.50 to $5 and upwards. Some students 
of small means board themselves at very small cost. Accommo- 
dations of the very highest grade can also be had at a reasonable 
price. It is our purpose to give wide latitude in the choice of liy- 
ing, so that all may be suited according to their tastes and means. 
During last summer and fall we inserted advertisments of the © 
university in the leading papers in the Northwest and Southwest, in 
response to which numerous letters have been received. This re- 
sulted in increased attendance at the university from abroad, and is 
the beginning, we hope, of the opening up, to the institution, of a 
wide field of usefulness and influence. 
: Respectfully submitted, 
CSA es, 
For the President. 
After the reading of the report by Superintendent Gilbreath, on 
motion, it was adopted and received by the Association. 
The President: Ladies and gentlemen, we have with us to-day a 
distinguished citizen of our sister State, Kentucky, whom I am 
13
-P-A-G-E-195
—194— 
glad to introduce to you, and I am sure you will be glad to hear 
from him, the Hon. Mr. Peterman. 
Mr. Peterman: Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen of the As- 
sociation—This is one duty I did not expect to be called upon to 
perform, but I see that you Tennesseans are as correct in your ap- 
plication of the principles of hospitality as you have been in former 
days. It is certainly a great pleasure to me to meet the official 
members of the educational affairs of the State of Tennessee. 
Tennessee and Kentucky are indeed, in every respect, very closely 
allied. In fact, I have observed that they are so closely allied that 
for a distance of some four hundred and forty miles, I believe, they 
have been found all the time hugging and kissing each other along 
the whole line. 
Certainly, I want to commend the idea of teaching Tennessee 
history. I could not be more fortunate in the selection of a topic’ 
for a brief talk than in selecting this, after it has been spoken of 
most eloquently by Captain Garrett in the report, and seconded by 
one of your noted legislators. I believe it is right in this day that 
we should cultivate a spirit of State pride. I am not a rebel. 
You are not rebels at the present time. There are no rebels. So 
the day has certainly come when all men can afford to realized that 
within the borders of our commonwealth as one of the initial steps 
in influencing the building up and furthering the progress of this- 
great Union, is the teaching of State pride and State love. I do 
not understand that magnificent granite column, that it represents 
united and solid the citizenship of your State. No that column is 
not solid. That column itself is composed of integral parts. Just 
so, this Union of ours is composed of integral States or common- 
wealths, and we, Mr. Chairman, by them, have to make the Union 
as solid in its support of the country as these colums are under the- 
beams which rest upon it. 
Ladies and gentlemen, I believe you are taking right steps. I 
would like to see every State in this Union interested in this way. 
Where a State is true to herself, she is true, at the same time, to 
the Union. I would like to see my own native State adopt a 
measure similar to this, because it certainly is most valuable to us- 
in our capacity as American citizens to preserve the heritage which 
we gather frcm the English. In that country they pursue it further: 
and carefully preserve the raw material, if you will let me use the
-P-A-G-E-196
=S195es 
expression, for history. So, in Tennessee, Kentucky, and the 
other great States of this Union there is material for history, and 
we should certainly take steps, as the great State of Tennessee has 
taken steps, to preserve this material, because the history of the 
States is the history of the Union at the same time. [Applause.] 
After announcing the time for committees to meet, the Associa- 
tion, on motion, adjourned until to-morrow morning at 9 o’clock. 
WEDNESDAY MORNING, DECEMBER liru. 
The Association was called to order by the President at 9:45 a.m. 
On motion of Mr. B. F. Jones, the report of the proceedings of 
this Association, as contained in this morning’s American, were re- 
ceived and adopted by the Association as the minutes of yesterday’s 
meeting. 
Captain Douglass: Mr. Chairman—The Committee on ‘‘ Educa- 
tional Exhibit at Tennessee Centennial Exposition” is ready to 
report. 
The Ohairman: Captain Douglass will read the report: 
REPORT. 
Inasmuch as the grand old Commonwealth of Tennessee is just 
now quitting a past so fraught with chivalrous deeds, so full of noble 
enterprise, and so rich in historic achievements, and is now about 
stepping upon the threshold of another century, it certainly seems 
appropriate thai its citizenship should rejoice to commemorate its 
100th anniversary, in a manner not only commensurate with its in- 
teresting and eventful past, but in anticipation of its great possi- 
bilities of the future. Of the forty-four sisters, none in the great 
galaxy of nationality has been more conspicuous in love of country, 
more chivalrous in dark hours of need, more untiring in their en- 
deavors, quicker to respond to the demands of patriotism, than the 
citizenship of the Volunteer State. From King’s Mountain to Appo- ~ 
mttox she has shed her blood, asa fitting sacrifice upon the altar of 
her country. In peace or in war, in prosperity or adversity, she has 
always been the same grand, persevering, untiring, inimitable self. 
In June, 1896, Tennessee will have scored its 100 years. And as 
is natural to a free, liberal and progressive people, a suitable recog-
-P-A-G-E-197
—196— 
nition of such an important event is not only a fixed fact, but that 
every mechanical and industrial interest will be appropriately rep- 
resented. The management of this great anniversary, recognizing 
the educational interest as an important factor, not only courteously 
offers us a place, but insists that our schools unite in strength, soul 
and body with them in making this Centennial a great and glorious 
success. It is now with this Association, to whose care is entrusted 
the official guardianship of the school affairs of the State, to accept or 
refuse so generous an offer. Your committee to a man would reply 
yes, thrice yes!—that we certainly think there is no interest so dear 
to our people as that of the children. But a few decades and the 
mantles of State and church will be theirs to assume. It is by and 
through them must be made, written and taught Tennessee’s future 
history. The child of to-day is the man of to-morrow. Would we 
prepare them to fitly occupy the high positions so worthily held by 
a distinguished ancestry ? Must Tennessee continue to grow, expand 
and develop through an educational posterity ? Assuredly the School 
Officers’ Association must play an important part in so great an en- 
terprise, for to you and you alone is committed the progress and 
suecess of the school interest of the State. 
It is with you to say whether or nota children’s department shall 
become a profitable and interesting feature of the Centennial. 
Certainly we could follow with pleasure the confines of the Wau- 
tauga, as drawn and pictured by the deft little hands of the moun- 
tains, or be deeply entertained by the recital of the irying occur- 
rences of the Cumberland settlements as portrayed by some boy or 
“girl of our midst. In an hundred untold ways can we, through 
these little minds, be taught and impressed with the great and event- 
ful past of our Stute. 
Your commitiee would remind you that under your charge there 
is an army of nearly 700,000 little souls, who, with proper disci- 
pline, might storm any fort or carry any citadel. That yours is a 
responsible duty; that this is certainly an age of action. Might 
not the query come, Is popular educstion in Tennessee a failure? 
Have the vast sums already expended been wasted, or can we demon- 
strate our success by placing before our people specimens of our 
handiwork? ‘The eyes of our sister States are open. Will we meet 
the issue like men? Assuredly it behooves us to gird up our loins, 
put on the armor and enter the contest in spirit and in truth. 
?
-P-A-G-E-198
—197— 
Your committee would further submit: 
1. That it is expected that you establish a children’s department. 
2. That an exhibit will be not only interesting and profitable, but 
a great incentive to the school interests of the State. 
3. That our resources for such an exhibit are vast; our means 
ample. 
4, That it will be a splendid object-lesson to our children and an 
jmpressive method of teaching our history. 
Now, in conclusion, inasmuch as the Centennial management, in 
the creation of a children’s department, has recognized the children 
of Tennessee as an important factor in the future of our State: 
Resolved, That we, the public school officers of the State, heart- 
ily indorse this movement, and cheerfully pledge our co-operation 
toward making it a prominent feature of the exhibition. 
Resolved, That we will assist the commissioners of this depart- 
ment, and will lend our aid toward the organization of the chil- 
dren’s auxiliaries in the interest of the Children’s Building.

Captain Douglass: I think, Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, 
that there is no business that has come under the direction and 
guidance of this body of more importance than the business before 
us to-day. In the adoption of these resolutions, and in the agree- 
ment to stand by this great enterprise of the State of Tennessee, 
you make a step forward in the progress and development of the 
public schools that will perhaps surpass any other exertion that 
you may make. It seals, as it were, every energy to the enterprise, 
and should direct every exertion we make towards the interests of 
the public schools of the State, and, when this committee comes 
with these resolutions, we say to you gentlemen, and to you, Mr. 
President, that we simply mean business. We say to you, Mr. 
State Superintendent, and to you County Superintendents, who
-P-A-G-E-199
—198— 
occupy the great guardianship of the great interests of the schools 
of the State, we say to you that you cannot 2fford to dally with 
this work or shift the responsibility on anybody else. You have 
no right, as guardians of these children, to say to the mechanical 
‘Interests, “make your exhibit,” and say to the industrial interests 
“make your exhibit,” and say so to every other interest in the 
State, “but, as for us, we will step aside.” You have no right to 
do that, and, if that is your idea, step down from your superin- 
tendency and let some other superintendent take your place. 
Oh, yes, but it is a great deal of trouble. It is trouble. You 
cannot make a successful teacher without tronble; you cannot 
make a successfal superintendent without trouble; you cannot 
make a progressive county without trouble, and you know it, too. 
Do we expect an exhibit from every school in the State? No. 
Is every school in the State prepared to make this? No, Could 
we find room for it? Probably not if we wanted to, but we have 
enough schools over the State, in the cities and progressive counties, 
to make our exhibit as good as Atlanta, or as good as Chicago. 
Did Tennessee have an exhibit at Chicago, either industrial, me- 
chanical or educational? No, sir. Did she have one at Atlanta? 
If she did I have not heard of it. Is it not time to make an effort 
to place our grand old State where she right‘ully belongs. She is 
certainly abreast in educational matters, and ought to be so pub- 
lished to the world. What is the object, simply to make a show? 
No, sir, but to make a true exhibit of our handiwork. It certainly 
can be made a profitable exercise in your schools. It willbe an in- 
centive {o school work. What*else? It is a great cbject-lesson, 
impressing upon the children of Tennnessee Tennessee history. Of 
the forty-four States of the Union none can present more thrilling 
or more interesting features of past history than Tennessee. No 
State, except perhaps two, Virginia and Massachusetts, that have 
played the part in national history that Tennessee has. No State 
presents a greater array of names of men who have become illus- 
trious than Tennessee. 
Iam a commissioner, but get no salary. It seems to me that it 
behooves each and every one to lend their best efforts toward mak- 
ing this Centennial a splendid success. That there is much oppo- 
sition, is most true; yet it is in adversity that true manhood is 
better exemplified. There is no time now for delay. We must go 
 
-P-A-G-E-200
  —199— 
to the front. You go to a man, and he says: “Oh, yes, but my 
county is against it,and I am afraid to press it.” I do despise a little 
man; I havea contempt for alittle man. What I mean by that is one 
that never has an idea unless he goes to somebody else to get it. 
Let us be men or monkies. We must take hold of this, and must 
bring all available means, and capture all possibilities that will lead 
to the success of the work. I do hope we will all take hold of this 
matter, in spirit and in truth. I believe I am commissioner of the 
county for the Centennial Board. JI wrote and begged and asked 
them not to appoint me, yet a great big commission was sent me. 
TI have accepted, and propose to do just the very best I can. 
But there is another feature of the teacher’s work that I would 
notice especially. I allude to the Children’s Department, over 
which has been placed that very competent and progressive teacher, 
Professor Davis. This is certainly one of the most attractive de- 
partments of the Centennial, and I have proposed to lend also a 
helping hand to this work. Auxiliaries are being established in 
many of our schools for the purpose of raising a fund toward aid- 
ing the Children’s Building. These auxiliaries are organized and 
run by the little folks, and a splendid work are they doing. Should 
the teacher take an interest in such small affairs? Unless he has 
in view a government position, or stands a first-class chance to be a 
cabinet officer, or magistrate, school director, or some other big 
office, I should answer yes, by all means, But there is a vast 
amount of trouble and vexation, and no pay. Well, the idea of a 
teacher fussing about pay! It would certainly be a splendid addi- 
tion to our already valuable collection to have the photo of such a 
teacher! Teachers have no right to fuss about pay. They never 
received much pay in their lives. No, sir, teachers labor for patri- 
otism, and, gentlemen, now is your time. But, all jesting aside, 
we do owe it to our profession, our pupils, and our people to take 
hold of this matter at once, bring it squarely before our respective 
counties, emphasize its importance, and dwell at length on the great 
good there must be to our State in having correctly and truthfully 
published its many great and innumerable advantages. Certainly, 
the teacher ought to play an important part in the progress and de- 
velopment of his State. Then let us get to work, with a heart for 
every fate, “still achieving, still pursuing,” never yielding until we 
accomplish a grand and glorious success.

The President: The question before the Association is on the 
adoption of the report. 
Supt. Gilbreath: As a member of the Department of Education 
of the Tennessee Centennial International Exposition, I have been 
requested to bring before this Association an address that they 
recently prepared, if you will give me time to read it. I will say 
that the department of education has been subdivided, and one sub- 
committee has charge of the higher institutions of learning and one 
the schools below the grade of colleges, or institutions granting 
degrees, and it is an address prepared by the committee last named. 
ADDRESS. 
“As you are already apprised, Tennessee will celebrate the cen- 
tennial of her statehood next year. This is to be done by means 
of an exposition, which, it is hoped, will rank second only to the 
great Columbian Exposition at Chicago, The abundant resources 
and splendid development of a great State will in some adequate 
measure be set forth. In addition to this, the Exposition will 
show in a large measure the advancement of humanity in arts, 
science and knowledge, thus typifying the magnificence with which 
the twentieth century shall burst upon the world. 
“Tn the Tennessee Centennial and International Exposition the 
educational exhibit ought to be second to no other interest. This 
is the opportunity of a century for our State to show what she is 
doing, and can do, in both public and private schools. Tennessee 
is writing her history in her schools. That history odght to be 
made manifest to the world. It rests with the schools and their 
friends to prepare and furnish such exhibits as shall be of proper 
educational value to our own people, and at the same time main- 
tain our prestige. 
“Tennessee is the educational center for many States. Hun- 
dreds of thousands of dollars come to our coffers from this source. 
We are on trial for our position. We must show by what imperial 
right we hold this leadership. It behooves us to do something 
worthy. Those who love their State should feel that this is not 
only her hour of opportunity, but of destiny. The teacher who 
hesitates to enter upon the work of preparing matter should con- 
sider that no more exciting motive can be set before pupils than 
that of preparing material for public inspection. Dead schools 
   
-P-A-G-E-202
—201— 
will be unable to take part, but, in this age of competition, those 
thoroughly alive will not shrink from a comparison of results with 
others. 
“The Department of Education desires to make a full exhibit of 
the résults of school work from kindergarten to university. All 
kinds of schools and all grades of work are to be represented. 
While much matter of a general nature will find lodgment in the 
Children’s Building, a classified exhibit of the entire field is to be 
placed in the Commerce and Liberal Arts Building, which is to be 
the largest on the grounds. 
«“<What shall we prepare ?” This will be the first question 
asked by many schools. No committee can answer this in full 
without interfering with the individuality or originality of schools. 
Written work must, naturally, form a large part of all exhibits— 
not prepared, doctored papers, but daily class exercises and exami- 
nation papers actually taken up, work really done. This letter is 
addressed to all schools, public and private, which do not give de- 
grees. The ingenuity of teachers will devise many things not 
thought of by a committee, but, in a graded system of schools, 
arithmetic, geography, with map-drawing, history, language and 
drawing would be the chief subjects from first to eighth grades. 
The beginning of the system might be kindergarten work. The 
high school studies would be some or all of these: Algebra, Geom- 
etry, Physics, Chemistry, English, Latin, Greek, Drawing, and 
other studies pursued. With these might be photographs of build- 
ings, history of school, course of study, programme of exercises, 
description of apparatus and libraries, methods of instruction, and 
all information of special or general interest. 
“Space will be free to schools. Apply early, stating the nature 
and amount of exhibits and space wanted. All matter must be in 
readiness on or before Sept. 1, 1896. For all information address, 
  “ ELLERY ©. Huntineton, Secretary, 
“ Nashville, Tenn.” 
Supt. Gilbreath: I will say, Mr. President, that teachers’ educa- _ 
tional assemblies are very apt to pass resolutions, and to indorse 
papers or speeches. No good will result to our educational inter- 
ests by simply indorsing the report of this committee. We must — 
take action, and we must not leave the work to a sister county; 
 
-P-A-G-E-203
—-202— 
but I would impress upon the members of the Association present 
this morning that, to make an educational exhibit that will be a 
credit to the State and an honor to the schools and counties, that 
we must do individual, personal work. We cannot transfer the 
responsibility, and I trust that when you vote in favor of the adop-— 
tion of the report of the committee, of which Captain Douglass is 
chairman, that you will do so with the full determination to do 
your part asan individual in making that educational exhibit a 
success. We realize in this Centennial an opportunity to popular- 
ize the public school interests of the State, to get the people more 
thoroughly in sympathy with the aims and objects of the public 
schools. As this paper states, it is the opportunity of the century, 
and should not be passed by without advantage being taken of it. 
Some one was asked a few days ago if he expected to take part, or 
to be present at this Centennial, and he said that he could not 
attend this time, but was making his arrangements to be present at 
the next Centennial. I trust that you will make your arrange- 
ments to be present at this Centennial, and let the future take care 
of itself. [Laughter and applause.] 
The President: Is it proposed to have that become a part of this 
report? 
Supt. Gilbreath: No, sir, only collaterally. I will submit it and 
it will go in with the papers. 
On taking the vote, the report of the Tennessee Centennial Com- 
mittee was received and adopted. 
The President: That they may have time to get ready to report, 
I will announce the following committee on resolutions, composed 
of Prof. G. R. McGee, Supt. Jesse Tomlinson, Miss Loula Hulme, 
Supt. C. L. Hayes and Supt. W. C. Lumley. 
Captain Douglass, on a question of information: I believe there 
is one of the executive committee absent. Am I right? 
Prof. Goodman: Yes, sir; Mr. Tanner. 
Captain Douglass: How is that vacancy filled ? 
The Chair: I would like to have it filled by the committee. The 
Chair will rule this way. There is a difference of opinion in this 
body as to that matter, I know from former discussions, but I think 
I remember the practice of the Association, and I desire to stay by 
that. I propose that the vacancy be filled by the nomination and 
election by {the committee itself/—the committee recommends to 
 
-P-A-G-E-204
—203— 
the Association, and the Association elects. _I further desire to 
announce the following Committee on Teachers’ Libraries: J. H. 
Allen, H. D. Huffaker, R. E. Goldsby, J. P. Rippey, and Miss 
Bethenia H. Nance. 
Capt. Smith: I would like to bring a little matter before the 
Association, and ask you to appoint a committee concerning it. I 
would like to have the Association indorse a historical magazine 
-that will be published by the Peabody Normal College, with Capt. 
Garrett a3 editor. I move that this committee be immediately ap- 
pointed by the Chairman. 
The motion was seconded, and carried unanimously. 
Supt. Hayes: The consolidated Committee on Reforms of Legis- 
Jation Needed to Protect the School Fund asks to have a little 
more time on its report. 
The Chair: Without objection, it will have more time. 
Professor Wharton: The Committee on Institute Work is ready 
to report. 
The Chair: The business before the house is the report of the 
Committee on Institute Work, by Prof. Wharton. Please read the 
report. 
NasHvinus, Tenn., December 11, 1895. 
To the Public School Officers’ Association : 
Your Committee on Institute Work would respectfully submit 
the following report: We reccommend that there be held in every 
county of the State, during the comming summer, a County Insti- 
tute, to continue in session not less than two weeks; that the date 
of its meeting be settled upon in March, and it be held either be- 
fore or after the Peabody State Institute, in that particular section. 
The date should be fixed in March, so that earnest and strenuous 
effort could be made before each County Court, at its April meet- 
ing, for an appropriation to pay the expense. If possible an expe- 
rienced Institute worker should be employed to conduct it, and the 
best of local talent engaged for the body of instruction. We earn- 
estly recommend ihat the subject of Tennessee History be made 
especially prominent at these Centennial County Institutes, Ad- 
vantage should be taken of our Centennial year to make our special 
appeal to the patriotism of our couuty authorities for assistance. 
The programme of the daily session should be based upoa the sylla- 
bus already issued by the State Superintendent, and practical in-~
-P-A-G-E-205
—204— 
struction in the school branches taught should be an important 
point, not to be overlooked. 
The direction and setting in order of the Peabody State Insti- 
tutes are in the hands of the State Superintendent, and they can be 
safely left to his sound judgment and wise direction; but your 
- committee are of the opinion that at Jeast six should be held—two 
in each of the grand divisions of the State—so as to make it possi- 
~ ble for the great body of the teachers to attend some one of them. 
We are of the opinion that their sessions should be four and, if 
possible, six weeks in length; and that, as far as practicable, each 
should be organized as a school of instruction. The attention of 
teachers should be drawn to the advantages of supplementing their 
county and home work by a further attendance upon their State 
instituions. Two weeks at the county, followed by six weeks at 
the nearest State Institute, would give two months’ instruction to 
teachers, an opportunity for their betterment, which many could 
and undoubtedly wouid utilize. A life-certificate of exemption 
from examination is a prize worthy of obtaining. 
The one Jast and most earnest recommendation of your committee 
to the educational army of the State, and for especial helpfulness. 
during the coming and greatest year in our Sjate’s history, is to 
organize, and to organize now, for the Centennial campaign in the 
summer of 1896. Respectfully submitted, 
A. D. WHARTON, 
C. 8. Doveuass, 
JEssE TOMLINSON, 
J. H. Jackson, 
Mepora V. Grass, 
R. E. Goupssy, 
T. Leren THompson. 
Professor Wharton: Now, Mr. Chairman, just a few words. 
That report is short. We have tried to make it short. There is no 
need to worry you with any remarks, which may very properly be 
made by members of the committee. This is intended to be a 
skeleton, however, upon which a body can be put; so a rounded, 
complete and perfect body may go forth from this meeting of the 
Association. There are two or three points that the committee had 
prominently before it. One of them was that the branch Institutes 
should, in every case where it was possible, be held not less than
-P-A-G-E-206
—205— 
two weeks, and many of the committee were in favor of a four 
weeks’ County Institute if it could be held, employing, as sug- 
gested in the report, the best home talent, and, if necessary, a 
leader from elsewhere. Now, the committee did not presume to go 
into details as to the daily management of one of these Institutes, 
but they just said they were of the opinion that it should be for the 
advancement in learning and in knowledge of the teachers who 
attended ; and that if the teachers who attended the County Insti- 
tutes needed actual instruction—needed to go to school, so to speak 
—to learn to be better posted on the subjects they teach, why turn 
the Institute in that direction. If the body of the teachers of the 
county are all well advanced and well. posted—a fine set of men 
and women—then turn the work of the Institute in a pedagogie 
direction. In other words, the authorities controlling each County 
Institute are left free to advance the cause of education as they 
may deem best. The committee felt some little delicacy about say- 
ing too much about State Institutes, because they realized they 
were the special care of the State Superintendent, and that various 
interests are to be considered in connection with their establish- 
ment, and they therefore state this question is left to the State Su- 
perintendent, merely suggesting that, in their opinion, if more of 
them could be established than have been it would be better. 
Individually, Mr. Chairman: I speak with the privilege of age 
in education. I have been a teicher so long that it would not be 
deemed particularly invidious in saying this—to speak individually 
and from my own standpoint and from an experience of some four 
or five years in this Institute work, I say it with all due deference 
to this body before whom I am standing, and I have made this re- 
mark to teachers this—my firm conviction is, that so far as the 
educational forces of the public school system of this State are con- 
cerned, their greater need is instruction. (Applause.) That is my 
experience. Now,I measure other men by myself in my profession, 
and I tell you I feel that I would like to go to school; I would 
like to sit down on a recitation bench and have a teacher in front of 
me; I would like to have a lesson assigned me; to have that lesson 
to study, and have that lesson to recite upon, because I would then 
feel the pressure upon me, and apply greater diligence and zeal to 
advance myself in the profession than I do when I am standing 
alone and just trusting to my own sense of what I ought to do.
-P-A-G-E-207
—206— 
There is a great deal of moral suasion ina little bit of physical force, 
and I think there are other people in just about the same condition, 
and if you that are entering into the profession don’t feel that way 
now, the time will come when you will feel the same. You take 
people; if you would master them, call them Colonel or Captain ; if 
you were to call them Tom or Jim they would be offended at you, 
but the time will come when Jim will like to be called Jim; he will 
like to be called by his boyhood name, and would be glad to have 
somebody call him Jim. These things are implanted in all of us. 
Lrepeat what I said before, that I think the greater part of the work 
of the county Institutes, and some of the State Institutes also, it seems 
to me, is along the line of instruction rather than a pedagogic line. 
Now, we may have before us a man that will get up and make a 
speech, and we enjoy the speech, and that will be the end of it. 
We will say to him when he presents the subject to us, ‘ That is 
first-rate, that is beautiful, I never heard anything clearer than that; ”” 
but reverse the position, and be compelled, you as a teacher, to do 
the same thing. Just put such means at work that the teachers 
themselves will be compelled to do the very thing that the speaker be- 
fore them has told them ought to be done, and then you will acecom- 
plish good. 
I have read a story wherein it was said there wasa great fire in a 
tall] building, and there was a woman up on the third floor leaning 
out of the window, and she was in imminent danger of losing her 
life. The ladder was run up, and the fireman started up this ladder, 
but blinded by the smoke that issued out from the window as he 
went up, he halted and hesitated—a life was at stake, but he was 
about to come down, when some one in thecrowd shouted out: “Cheer 
him, men; give him a cheer!” And the vast crowd sent up a roar of 
cheering, and that stimulated him, put strength aud nerve and bold- 
ness in him, and he mounted the ladder and seized the woman and 
brought her down safely, and the life was saved. So, I think, Mr. 
President, that the resolutions we adopt upon this and all other sub- 
jects should be conceived in a spirit of encouragement and cheer, and 
we should just give the people encouragement—that in everything 
we do in this Association, we should give them acheer. (Applause.) 
Ben. F. Jones: Some of Brother Huffaker’s people think I don’t 
think about anything but numbers ; that I am a one-idea man, and, 
from the expressions from new made friends, some of them think L
-P-A-G-E-208
—207—- 
think only about “ Physiology, with special reference to narcotics 
and stimulants,” but I feel good after the talk we have had in con- 
nection with the resolutions this morning. If you will listen to it 
I will give you a cheer. You say that these Institutes cannot be 
held. Let me stand up here to-day, fellow-superintendents, and 
testify that they can. Over in a valley of our State, with Walden’s ~ 
Ridge lifting its cloud-capped summit toward the sky upon the 
west, and the frowning cliffs of Cumberland overhanging our yalley,. 
there, beneath the shadows of those mountains, we held a four 
weeks’ Institute last year, at an expense of ten cents a day for 
Uncle Addison to sweep the room. I receive the munificent salary 
up there of one hundred dollars a year, and act as Superitendent,. 
and I helped to give our teachers instruction—I am talking of the 
teachers in my county—my county could not and would not, of 
course, make any preparation to pay an instructor. We held a four 
weeks’ Institute in the little county of Sequatchie, and our daily 
average attendance was about fifty per cent. of our teaching force. 
We had them there from Bledsoe County, and one or two from the 
county just south of us, and, Brother Huffaker, some of them said 
it was nearly as good as your Institute in some respects. (Laughter.) 
Tam glad Brother Huffaker is an East Tennessean. I am just one 
by adoption, but I am an East Tennessean now, and I live in the 
mountains—a sand-hill man if you want to call me that, but we 
have noble children there, children that can be educated, children 
that can think, children that can understand, children that cam 
climb these high cliffs, and by them be inspired to a higher life. 
We held our four weeks’ institute there, and our teachers were 
satisfied. We gained inspiration from Dr. Parker’s book during 
the four weeks we studied it. We did not have able instructors, 
but we tried to teach the classes the best we could. We tried to sit 
at the feet of that great man, and did the best we could to teach his 
book and to do some pedagogic work, if I may be permitted to call 
it that. I had a young friend, a former pupil, who taught arith- 
metic and assigned lessons and required them to be recited ; another 
young man assigned lessons in geography. We held our four 
weeks’ institute and taught it ourselves. : 
Superintendent Jackson: I move that the report of the commit- 
mittee be adopted. 
Motion seconded and report received.
-P-A-G-E-209
—208— 
The President: By authority of the action of this Association 
just awhile ago, I appoint as a committee to recommend the publi- 
cation of Capt. Garrett the following persons: Hon. S. G. Gilbreath, 
Capt. C. S. Douglass, A. D. Wharton, H. D. Huffaker and R. E. 
Goldsby. 
On motion of Capt. C. S. Douglass, the Association here took a 
recess subject to call of the chairman. 
The Association was called to order at 11:30 by President Paine, 
and the reports of committees were called for. 
Capt. Douglass: The Committee on the Historical Journal is now 
ready to report. 
Your Committee on Historical Journal would respectfully sub- 
mit the following: Inasmuch as it is proposed by the Peabody Nor- 
ml College to shortly issue an historical journal of research, under 
the editorship of Prof. W. R. Garrett, in which will be embodied 
much origin! matter pertaining to the history of Tennessee, and 
recognizing the fact that our teachers are not as well informed upon 
this subject as they should be, and that it is highly essential to the 
cultivation of patriotism that an intimate acquaintance with our 
State history should be possessed by all; therefore your committee 
recommend that this Association heartily indorse this commendable 
enterprise, and that they will cheerfully co-operate with the man- 
agement in furthering its success throughout the State. 
Very respectfully, S. G. GILBREATH, 
C. S. Doverass, 
R. E. Goupspy, 
A. D. WHARTON, 
H. D. Hurraker. 
Capt. Douglass: Mr. Chairman, this is but another means of 
giving to our boys and girls the history of our State; this is but 
another means of cultivating one of the highest and most ennobling 
elements of citizenship, that of patriotism; it is another means of 
instilling into the children and the teacher the love of home, which 
is the great foundation stone upon which is builded a State’s gran- 
deur and a State’s nobleness. Show me a man without the love of 
_ home and without the love of parents, and I will show you a man 
dead to the highest sentiments and the most ennobling character- 
istics of manhood. Here I hold in my hand a circular, I believe it 
is, which explains this, and there is no use for me to say anything -
-P-A-G-E-210
—209— 
further than this; but I wish to impress upon the superintendents 
and upon the teachers present that they should get this journal into 
every county by every fair and honorable means possible. It looks 
high, I know—$3.00 a year; but what is one good original piece 
of history worth? TI attended the closing exercises at Rural Acad- 
emy, a very flourishing school, the other day, with the State Super- 
intendent. I live in Sumner County, was reared there, as was my 
ancestry. I heard an old citizen of my county get up and say that 
right there at Castalian Springs was where Thomas Sharpe Spencer 
lived for six months in a great big sycamore tree. I knew that; I 
knew that he broke his knife in two and gave half of it to Holiday, 
and I had heard that he had the biggest foot of any man in Ten- 
nessee. I had heard that, but I didn’t know that I stood on the 
ground where the first corn was planted in the State of Tennessee. 
I was making a speech right then where the first corn crop was 
made, and within one mile and one-half of three important forts 
that did good work during Indian troubles. These facts are worth 
$3.00 to me; I wouldn’t take $3.00 for them. I tell you there are 
enterprises and incidents that none of these histories record, but you 
will get them from this journal that Capt. Garrett is going to issue. 
Then let us come right up, put our shoulders to the work and push 
forward. Let us take it and get our teachers to take it. 
Prof. Goodman: I move the adoption of the report. 
Superintendent Henderson: Mr. Chairman, I am very sorry I 
didn’t get to hear what was said upon the subject of this report. I 
want to say that I am heartily in sympathy with the steps that are 
being taken in reference to this magazine. When I first received 
a letter in reference to it, with a subscription blank, I went to work 
and sent in a number of names. I went to my teachers first, and 
went to a number of teachers in the county, and I propose to con- 
tinue the work. I think my teachers will take this magazine, and 
that we should take this work up and discuss it in our county In- 
stitutes, and that we, as superintendents, ought to do all in our 
power to make it a financial success as well as a literary success. I 
for one will do all I can to assist in this matter. 
Superintendent Overall: I want to endorse what has been said 
in reference to this work. I want to say right here that I don’t 
think a better man could be found, not only in the State but in the 
14
-P-A-G-E-211
—210— 
country, to place at the head of the work, and I believe the super— 
intendents ought to subscribe for this magazine and assist in the 
work, I think we ought to aid Capt. Garrett in every way pos- 
sible in getting data concerning the early history of Tennessee. 
Like Superintendent Douglass, I was interested in a talk with Capt. 
Garrett only a short time ago about the early settlement of David- 
son County. I did not know, until a short time ago, that my great 
grandfather came down here with James Robertson as one of the 
early settlers of this section of the country. I feel that we ought 
to heartily co-operate in this work. 
On taking the vote, the report of the committee was received and 
adopted. 
Captain Garrett: I am very heartily obliged to the Superin- 
tendents and teachers for the offer of support which they have made. 
I did not know that this committee was appointed in this matter, 
and therefore it is a pleasant surprise to me to hear of the interest 
you feel in it, and it is not, perhaps, out of place for me to thank 
you for the interest they have taken in it, and to add one word in 
this connection—that it is not a money-making enterprise. I do 
not receive one dollar as editor of this magazine. It is not my 
property, and I have nothing to do with it except to perform the 
work of editor. It is published by the Normal College out of their 
fund. The Normal College supplies the funds to have it printed. 
The Normal College does not expect or desire to derive one cent’s 
profit from it. If the circulation should pay more than the cost, 
whatever isso derived would be devoted to hunting up and original 
investigation—to getting reports and papers and publications of this 
kind. It is not expected to have a very large circulation. It is 
only expected to circulate among literary people, who are best read. 
‘We want to get all the subscribers possible, but have not expected 
the circulation to be large—have expected it to be largely, Mr. Presi- 
dent, among that class of our fellow-citizens who are now the most pro- 
gressive and best informed circle in our State, that is, our teachers, 
and teaching forces who come together to encourage the teacher to 
better work themselves, the best informed people in the State of Ten- 
nessee. In issuing this from the Normal College we wish to supply 
matters that are new—to go to the sources of investigation and 
gather together old papers and old reports, things that have been 
secreted about. We will publish a large number of interesting
-P-A-G-E-212
—211— 
documents which are lying in manuscript deposited in the Tennessee 
Historical Society. In order to do that it is necessary that the 
price should not be too small. When the Journal's circulation is 
not expected to be very large, it is necessary that the cost should be 
a little higher. I have nothing to do with the cost whatever; that 
is a matter managed by the financial officers of the Normal College, 
and their desire is simply, if possible, to meet expenses, which I 
think they will hardly do, and the college is willing to incur some 
outlay, but want as much as possible to come out even in the mat- 
ter. They desire to extend its circulation as far and wide as pos- 
sible, especially in the State of Tennessee. I make this explanation 
so you may understand that it is not a money-making scheme, and 
so far as I am personally concerned, I am not interested in it to the 
extent of one dollar. I take this occasion to express my thanks to 
this Association for the kind support which they have proffered in 
the resolution they passed. 
The President: The question before the Association is the further 
consideration of reports. 
Captain Douglass: The Executive Committee have met, four of 
them, the absent member being Mr. Tanner, from West Tennessee, 
and we have unanimously selected Miss Fitzgerald to act with the 
committee in selecting officers for the next twelve months. 
Motion that Miss Fitzgerald be elected to fill Mr. Tanner’s place. 
Motion carried, and Miss Fitzgerald was elected. 
Miss Fitzgerald—Mr. President: I thank you for the honor con- 
ferred. 
Supt. H. D. Huffaker: The Committee on Teachers’ Circulating 
Libraries is ready to report. 
The President: The chairman of the committee will read the re- 
port. 
The Committee on Teachers’ Circulating Libraries reported as 
follows : 
Your Committee on Teachers’ Circulating Libraries beg leave to 
submit the following report : Owing to the fact that the subject of 
teachers’ circulating libraries was reported upon at length during 
our meeting in 1894, in which report suggestions, plan of work, etc., 
are fully outlined, we deem it unnecessary to report in detail at this 
time. We, therefore, respectfully refer the Association to said re-
-P-A-G-E-213
—212— 
report, which may be found on page 59 of the printed proceedings 
of this body for the year 1894, 
Respectfully submitted, 
J. H. ALLEN, 
H. D. HurraKer, 
R. E. Goupssy, 
BetHenta H. NANCE, 
J. P. Rippey. 
The President: What will you do with the report? 
Professor Goodman: I move that the report be adopted. 
Motion carried, and report adopted. 
Superintendent Hayes: The Committee on Needed Legislation to 
Protect the School Fund is ready to report. In the first place, I 
will state the committee is not entirely satisfied with the condition 
of their report. There is a great amount of work to be done before 
a report that is entirely satisfactory in detail could be submitted. 
We have outlined the matter, and recommend that a committee be 
appointed to take this matter under consideration, to be reported on 
at our next meeting. 
. 1. To make school and civil districts co- extensive. 
2. That one director be elected from each district. 
3. That directors constitute a County Board of Education. 
4, That the County Board of Education appoint a board of three 
examiners, of which the County Superintendent shall be Chairman. 
5. That the County Superintendent of schools shall act as Secre- 
tary and Treasurer of the Board of Education. 
6. That the County Board of Education shall meet semi-annually 
for the transaction of business, and at such other times as the Chair- 
man of the County Board of Education shall deem necessary ; each 
member to be allowed $1 for each of the semi-annual meetings. 
7. District directors will select teachers for their respective dis- 
tricts, subject to confirmation or rejection by the County Superin- 
tendent, and attend to the local sffairs of the district. 
8. The County Superintendent shall have general supervision 
over the schools of the county, and attend to such other business as 
the: duties of the office may require. 
9. His term of office shall be four years. 
10. His compensation shall be fixed by the County Board of 
Education, and paid out of the school fund.
-P-A-G-E-214
—213— 
11. He may be removed from office for misconduct or inefficiency. 
12. The Board of Examiners shall examine and license all 
teachers, and hold all other examinations required by law. 
13. Applicants for license to teach will pay the County Board of 
Examiners $1 for each examination. 
14. Members of the Board of Examiners, except the County Su- 
perintendent, shall be paid $2 each per day for time actually em- 
ployed in the examination and licensing of teachers, out of ex- 
amination fees, 
15. That the remaining fees be used in the support of County 
Teachers’ Institutes. 
‘We recommend that a committee of five, of which the State Su- 
perintendent shall be ex-officio Chairman, be appointed to take mat- 
ters into further consideration and report upon them at our next 
meeting. F. K. Henperson, 
C. L. Haynes, 
W. E. Lumury, 
S. G. GrtBREaTH, 
R. L. Jones, 
J. .E, CUNNINGHAM. 
Superintendent Hayes: We have, as part of the report, the bill 
which was offered in the last Legislature, and recommend that this 
bill be made a part of the report, except wherein it conflicts with 
recommendations already submitted, provided these recommenda- 
tions are adopted. I hope the matter will be placed in the hands 
of a committee of five, of whem the State Superintendent shall be 
ex-officio Chairman, and that that committee shall continue until 
the next meeting. 
Superintendent Huffaker: I move that the report be referred toa 
committee composed of the State Superintendent, the President of 
this Association and the ex-State Superintendents who are members 
of this body, to report at the next meeting of this body. 
The motion was seconded. 
T. Leigh Thompson—Mr. Chairman: I have a resolution on the 
subject of school law I would like to leave before the Association 
in connection with this report, and think this would be the proper 
time. 
The Chairman: Without objection, Mr. Thompson may read his. 
resolution.

Wuereas, The Superintendent of Public Schools of each county 
by law now prepares the examinations for teachers applying for cer- 
tificates {0 teach our public schools; and, 
Wuerras, These examinations in the various counties are ma- 
terially different, in consequence of which the test of scholarship 
and ability to teach varies in each county; and, 
Wuereas, A second grade certificate in one county may repre- 
sent the same scholarship that a first grade certificate does in another 
county, on account of the difference in the examination questions, 
thereby doing great injustice to many teachers; therefore, be it 
Resolved, That we, the Public School Officers’ Association, rec- 
ommend to the next General Assembly of this State an amendment 
to the public school laws, to the effect that it shall be the duty of 
the State Superintendent of Public Instruction to prepare the ex- 
aminations for teachers applying for certificates to teach the publie 
schools of the State, and that these examinations be held upon the 
same day throughout the State. 
Mr. Taompson: This matter has been called to my attention by 
the examinations which different Superintendents make out for 
the teachers of their counties, and I have seen this result: that one 
‘Superintendent will give very easy examinations, tonsequently 
many teachers get first grade certificates. In another county the 
Superintendent would give a rather hard examination, and thereby 
many teachers get second grade certificates, where, if the teachers 
in the two counties had stood the same examination, we would find 
the second grade certificate in one county would be equal to the 
first grade in the other; so their certificates do not represent the 
same scholarship in the different counties. I understand that a first 
grade ought to represent the same scholarship throughout the State, 
and without any reflection, Mr. President, upon anybody, because 
Tam not acquainted with a Superintendent of any county except 
my own especially, [ have seen examinations that really were not 
a test of scholarship. ‘The teachers would stand those examinations 
and get first grade certificates when in reality not fit to teach at all. 
I believe it should be the duty of the State Superintendent to make 
out these examinations, because I believe, asa rule, he can best 
judge of the requirements of a teacher to teach school; and then 
- the examinations will be more general, and will be a truer test of 
the ability and scholarship of any man or woman to teach school.
-P-A-G-E-216
—2156— 
I also provide in this that these examinations ought to be held upon 
the same day throughout the whole State for this reason: that if 
the examination is held in Sumner County upon one day and the 
examination is held in Bedford or an adjoining county upon another 
day, that the teachers of Bedford County could easily get the ex- 
amination questions front Sumner and prepare themselves especially 
upon that examination. So I think, in order to get a uniformity 
of tertificates—certificates that will represent a uniformity of schol- 
arship—the teachers should stand the same examinations and should 
be put upon the same equality—should stand these examinations 
upon the same day. 
Superintendent Overall: Who is to conduct these examinations 
and grade them ? 
Mr. Thompson: I made no provision for that. I think some 
provision might be made. In my county they usually appoint a 
committee. I leave that to the Superintendents. 
Supt. Jackson: I move that this resolution be adopted, or rather 
that it go as an amendment to the report of the committee. 
Supt. Huffaker: Wouldn’t it be better to have it with the report 
of the committee ? ft 
The President: It would go to the committee in connection with 
the report. 
Supt. Gilbreath: Does that motion mean that this resolution is 
referred to the committee and endorsed by this body? 
The President: I understand the motion to mean that this body 
desires this resolution to accompany the report of the committee to 
the special committee. 
On taking the vote, the motion was carried, carrying with it the 
resolution of Mr. Thompson. 
The President: Weare now ready to dispose of the report of the 
Committee on School Law. : 
Mr. Huffaker: I renew my motion that it be referred to a special 
committee. 
The President; The question before the Association is on the 
motion of Mr. Huffaker, that this report, carrying with it the reso- 
lution of Mr. Thompson, be referred to a special committee com- 
posed of the present State Superintendent, with the President of 
the Association and the ex-State Superintendents who are members
-P-A-G-E-217
—216— 
of this Association. You mean, of course, the incoming President ? 
Mr. Huffaker: Yes, sir. 
On taking the vote the motion was carried and reported adopted. 
Capt. Smith: I believe it would be proper at this time to ask the 
State Teachers’ Association to appoint a similar committee to confer 
with this committee. I move that we request the State Teachers’ 
Association to appoint a committee to confer with this committee, 
to present this question to the General Assembly. x 
On taking the vote the motion was carried. 
Supt. Lumley: I desire to offer a resolution here: 
Wuereas, The State Superintendent of Schools is required to 
make annual tours of inspection among the public schools of the 
State ; and, 
Wuereas, No provision is made in the school laws for paying 
the expenses of the said tours of inspection ; be it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of this body that the Legislature of 
the State of Tennessee be urged to make an appropriation of $1,000 
per annum, or such a part of it as may be needed, to pay the tray- 
eling expenses of the State Superintendent of Schools. 
Capt. Smith: I move its adoption. 
The motion carried and the resolution was adopted. 
Supt. McGee: Mr. President, in regard to the Committee on 
Legislation of the State Teachers’ Association, I do not now re- 
member the names of all that committee. Capt. Garrett is one, 
Capt. Douglass another, Prof. Wharton another, and I suppose 
there are none of that committee who have not been notified of 
their appointment. 
Prof. Goodman: There is nothing now but the reports of the 
Committee on Resolutions and the Executive Committee. 
Capt. Douglass: I don’t believe there is a candidate before this 
body. If you will let us retire, I think we can select the officers 
in five minutes, or ten at most. This is the most unselfish body I 
ever saw. Nota man has come to me and asked me please to work 
for him. 
On motion, the Executive Committee was permitted to retire for 
a few minutes to select officers. 
Supt. Gilbreath: Some of the Superintendents are having trouble 
with their reports, especially in financial items. If there are any of 
the County Superintendents present this morning whose reports have
-P-A-G-E-218
—217— 
not been receivedfas correct in all particulars, I would be glad to 
meet with them es afternoon in my office, that we may reach an 
understanding without further correspondence. 
Supt. McGee: The Committee on Resolutioos is now ready to 
report. 
The President: Without objection, the Chairman of the Com- 
mittee will report. 
REPORT. 
We, your Committee on Resolutions, would respectfully submit 
the following: ' 
1. We congratulate the officers and members of this Association 
on the very pleasant and prosperous meeting now drawing to a 
close, and feel confident that the influence of this session for educa- 
tional advancement will be felt throughout our entire State. 
2. Resolved, That the thanks of this body are tendered His Ex- 
cellency, Gov. Turney, for the cordial and kindly manner in which 
he received the Association, and for the words of cheer and encour- 
agement in his address of welcome. 
3. That we appreciate the courteous and efficient services of our 
President, Hon. Thomas H. Paine ; of our Secretary, Prof. Frank 
Goodman; and of our Executive Committee, jand give “honor 
where honor is due” in saying that the large measure of success in 
this meeting is due to their efforts. 
4, That this Association has been both pleased and benefitted by 
the address of Mr. Peterman, of Kentucky, on “State History and 
Civil Government ;” and especially by the remarks of Mrs. J. W. 
Settle on the subject of teaching physiology with special reference 
to the effects of stimulants and narcotics. 
5. That our thanks are expressed to Maj. W. L. Danley and the 
Nashville, Chattanooga & St. Louis Rallroad, the Nicholson and 
other hotels, to the Nashville American and the Banner, for cour- 
tesies and favors extended the members of this Association. 
6. That Dr. G. W. F. Price, Professor Schneider and the young 
ladies of the Nashville College for Young Ladies, have placed us 
under obligations which we cannot discharge. The musical enter- 
tainment given by them in honor of our Association was grand in 
conception and execution, and forms one of the most delightful 
features of our entire session. 
7. That since our last meeting there has been a change in our
-P-A-G-E-219
—218— 
State Superintendency ; that while with regret we part from our 
former State Superintendent, Hon. Frank M. Smith, whose official 
administration we heartily indorse, we greet with pleasure his suc- 
cessor, Hon. S. G. Gilbreath, and pledge him our hearty support in 
all of his efforts to make our schools better and our people nobler.

Committee. 
Professor Goodman: I moye its adoption, with the amendment 
that refers to the President and Secretary. I think the Executive 
Committee ought to be included, for the reason that they did a 
great deal of work during the year. 
Supt. McGee: If there is no objection on the part of any mem- 
ber of the committee I will insert that in the resolutions. 
Supt. Overall: I would like to add one little resolution, if there 
is no objection by the members of the Association, and that is that 
this Association sends its sympathy and regards to the aged ex- 
Superintendent, Mr. Trousdale. 
The President: The question is on the adoption of the resolu- 
tions, with the amendments. 
Prof. Goodman: There is one other thing which might well 
come in our resolutions, and that is an expression of sympathy and 
co-operation with the Southern Educational Association, which 
meets in Hot Springs December 30, 31, January 1 and 2. I move 
that that also be included. 
Motion seconded. 
The President: It is moved and seconded that a resolution ex- 
pressing hearty co-operation and sympathy with the Southern Edu- 
cational Association, soon to meet at Hot Springs, Ark., be also 
made part of these resolutions. Are you ready for the question? 
On taking the vote, the motion was carried, and the resolution 
incorporated. 
The President: The question recurs on the adoption of the reso- 
lutions as read and amended. 
The motion carried, and the resolutions were adopted unani- 
mously. ‘

Prof. Goodman: The time fixed for our Centennial is one hun- 
dred days from September 1. It has not definitely been settled, as 
I take it, whether this hundred days is to mean work-days, or one 
hundred days including Sundays. If it is one hundred days in- 
eluding Sundays, that would cause the Exposition to close some 
twenty days earlier than if one hundred work days. Of course, 
the Exposition will run into December anyhow—say to December 
3, or 8 possibly—but, I take it, it would be nice for our Association 
to meet during the Centennnial. The question is whether or not there 
should be some action taken, but I leave that subject to the executive 
committe. I make the suggestion, and leave it for somebody to 
make the proper motion, if such is necessary, or if any amendment 
is necessary to our constitution. 
Supt. McGee: I would like to suggest, in the same connection, 
that we would recommend some special week during the time that 
the Exposition will be in progress; that we recommend that no 
school in the State be in session during that week. Just make the 
recommendation from the Association that all the schools have one 
week, say during the month of October, that no school shall be in 
session, to give the teachers an opportunity to visit the Exposition. 
I will make the motion that the last week in October be set apart 
as teachers’ week, and that we recommend that no school be in 
session during that time at all. 
Motion seconded. 
The President: You have heard the motion. 
Capt. Smith: Had not we better leave that to the Executive 
Committee to appoint some week? We do not know what week 
will be best. 
Supt. McGee: We had better leave it to them. 
Prof. Goodman: I move to request the Executive Committee to 
co-operate with a similar committee of the State Teachers’ Associa- 
tion—there was such a committee appointed at its last meeting—to 
try to have one week as teachers’ week. Let our committee co- 
operate with the State Teachers’ Association. 
Prof. McGee: As President of the State Teachers’ Association, 
J authorize you to notify our committee. 
Prof. Goodman: As Secretary, I will do so. 
Prof. McGee: My motion is that the Executive Committee, in 
connection with the State Superintendent, be instructed to set apart
-P-A-G-E-221
—220— 
some week during the Exposition, which shall be a holiday week 
in all the schools, so the pupils and teachers may attend, and 
amended to let that committee co-operate with the State Teachers’ 
Association committee. ; 
Motion carried. : 
Capt. Douglass: The Executive Committee report as follows: 
For President, N. D. Overall, of Rutherford; for Vice-president, 
J. R. McDonald, of Crockett; for Secretary, Prof. Frank Good- 
man. Executive Committee—H. D. Huffaker, Chairman, A. H. 
Wright, R. E. Goldsby, J. H. Jackson, and Ben F. Jones, of Se- 
quatchie. 
The President: You have heard the report of the committee. 
What is the pleasure of the Association ? 
Motion that the report be received. Motion carried, and report 
of the Executive Committee adopted. 
Supt. Thomas H. Paine: Fellow-superintendents I desire to con- 
gratulate you before introducing your new President on the fact that 
you have accomplished in one day and a half what you have formerly 
been taking almost three days for, and it has been by your prompt 
attention to and active discharge of your duties. The work has 
been carefully done, nothing having been overlooked. I want to 
say in retiring that I appreciate the kindness you have shown me, 
and thank you for your forbearance with my blundering during the 
session, and for your active co-operation. It gives me a great deal 
of pleasure to introduce to you Superintendent Overall, of the 
county of Rutherford, waom you have just elected as presiding 
officer for the coming year. 
Supt. Overall: I thank you, members of this Association, for the 
honor conferred upon me. I want to ask your help and co-operation 
in all the deliberations that shall come before this body while I am its 
chief officer. I shall strive to the very best of my ability to im- 
partially conduct the duties of the office, and you shall never have 
cause to regret the action you have taken in so honoring me, and 
honoring my county, Rutherford, through its representative. I 
again thank you for the honor you have conferred upon me. 
On motion of Supt. Thomas H. Paine, the Association adjourned 
sine die, and was dismissed with prayer by the President.

ANNUAL REPORT 
OF THE 
UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE, TO THE 
STATE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION, 
For THE YEAR ENDING DECEMBER 20, 1895. 
  
To the Honorable State Superintendent of Public Instruction, Nash- 
ville, Tenn.: 
Srr—As President of the University of Tennessee, I respectfully 
submit this, my annual report, for the year ending Dec. 20, 1895. 
This period has been marked by the death of one of our ablest 
and most distinguished trustees, Judge Milton Preston Jarnagin, 
who departed this life May 12, 1895, at Bayou Goula, Louisiana, 
where he had gone in search of health. He was a native of Hast 
Tennessee, as was his father beforehim. He had attained the rather 
mature age of sixty-nine years, and during that period had lived a 
life of usefulness and honor. His devotion to the law, and to his 
own personal affairs, did not so occupy his time but that he found 
opportunity to do much for the cause of religion and education. 
The fact that in recent years he had been a director in the Rogers- 
ville Synodical College, a trustee of King College, Bristol, as well 
as a member of our own Board of Trustees, gives evidence of his 
wide sympathies with education. 
Judge Jarnagin was one of the most faithful members of our 
Board of Trustees. He was always present at its meetings, and 
ready to do his part of the work and take his share of the responsi- 
bility. For several years he served as Chairman of the Board of 
Control of the Experiment Station. Proper recognition of his 
services has been made by the Board. 
ATTENDANCE, 
Notwithstanding the continuance of business depression, the at- 
tendance has kept up well, the statistics of which are as follows:

The work being done by the student body is very sitioiacnbiy and 
the order excellent. We have reason for congratulating ourselves 
upon the changed character of the institution in this respect. The 
traditional college disorders and outbreaks have been entirely elimi- 
nated. Hazing and college pranks are unknown. A higher sense of 
honor has been established with regard to shirking work, and dis- 
‘hones: practices. The moral standard among the students has been 
strengthened and placed ona high plane. There are various ways 
of accounting for all these improvements. Perhaps the most im- 
portant is the adoption of the paternal system of government which 
removes all antagonism between student and faculty. The Young 
Men’s Christian Association organization, with its splendid building 
and equipments, is also working a most salutary influence for good. 
The admission of women has likewise exerted a positive influence. 
for the better. A Woman’s League for self-government, and the 
egntrol of the building allotted to them, has aided in caring for the 
women students, 
A new agreement has been made with the Medical and Dental 
Department, by which it has been brought into closer and more ° 
satisfactory relation with the University. The direct management 
of this department will very properly remain in the control of its 
particular officers. All additions to the faculty will be made by 
submitting the names for election by our Board of Trustees. The 
requirements for admission and for graduation must also be ap- 
proved by our Board, and the University has the right to send a 
committee at any time to investigate the workings of the depart- 
ment. ‘The diplomas of this department are to be delivered at the 
commencement at Nashville by the President of the University, or 
 
-P-A-G-E-230
—227— 
some representative of the institution. The graduates will be en- 
titled to all the privileges and honors of graduates of the University 
of Tennessee. The Medical and Dental Department is to collect 
its own fees, and is to nave no financial claims upon the University 
proper. 
By limitation of his term of office, in accordance with the War 
Departuent rules, Lieut. Laurence D. Tyson, Ninth Infantry, United 
State Army, who has been detailed at this University as Professor 
of Military Science and Tactics, was relieved on the Ist of Septem- 
ber by Cupt. George LeRoy Brown, Eleventh Infantry, United 
States Army. / 
Tt gives us great pleasure to testify, at this place, to the efficient 
and faithful service of Lieutenant Tyson during the entire period 
of his connection with this institution. The position of professor 
of military science and tactics in @ civil institution is, in some re- 
spects, a difficult one to fill, One man will err in trying to make 
an army post of the institution, and another will, in view of the 
novel circumstances, so different from army life, despair of accom- 
plishing anything and cease trying to doso. Lieutenant Tyson ad- 
dressed himself to the solution of the peculiar problem presented at 
an institution like ours with a common sense that was admirable 
and an enthusiasm that no obstacle could overcome. Instead of 
trying to change a civil institution into a military one, he sought to 
find how a maximum amount of military instruction and practical 
training could be imparted to the students without disturbing the 
existing conditions or antagonizing the interests of any other de- 
partment. The President believes that he has solved this problem 
for an institution of the character of ours, and that, with slight mod- 
ifications, the plans introduced by him may be safely followed so 
long as the environment remains the same. 
Lieutenant Tyson made a high reputation in our community asa 
man of honor, a scholar of ability, and an officer learned, skilled 
and zealous in his profession. The people of our entire community 
and many throughout the State who learned to know him, will fol- 
low him in his career with grateful interest. His advancement at 
any time will be sure to give them the greatest pleasure. 
_ ‘The University of Tennessee is to be congratulated upon the de- 
tail of Captain George LeRoy Brown, Eleventh Infantry, United 
States Army, to succeed Lieutenant Tyson at the expiration of his
-P-A-G-E-231
—228— 
term of office. It is an unusual thing for a Captain in the army to 
be detailed to college duty, as this service is usually considered a 
part of a Lieutenant’s education. Captain Brown is a graduate of 
West Point, and an officer who has had an unusually active and 
varied career, and has rendered very efficient service as professor 
of military science and tactics at one or two colleges before, where 
he made the record of a good disciplinarian, an able officer and a 
fine military instructor. He has entered zealously upon the work 
of his department, and has won the cordial esteem and support of 
every one, students as well as professors, connected with the insti- 
tution. By reason of these qualifications and of his personal traits 
as a cultivated Christian gentleman, we are very confident in pre- 
dicting a most successful career for Captain Brown at the Univer- 
sity of Tennessee. 
Since 1879 the University has been, to all intents and purposes, 
a part of the public school system of the State. It has always been 
our earnest desire to have this relation kept up and so understood. 
A complete.system of State education requires a correllation of all 
grades of work, from the lowest to the highest. The common 
school should lead up to the secondary and high school, the high 
school to the college, and the college to the university. The State’s 
adoption of a system of secondary schools will, no doubt, contribute 
much to the unification of this work. The difficulty in the past 
has been the want of proper connection between the different 
grades of work. This deficiency is being slowly removed. 
The great desideratum now is that a sufficient number of second- 
ary and high schools shall be established in every county, and es- 
pecially in all centers of population, to give thorough and efficient 
training in preparation for the higher work of the college and the 
university. It is the purpose of the university to encourage, by all 
means in its power, schools of this kind. It is always our pleasure 
to put upon our accredited list such schools as do thorough work, 
and to admit their graduates to the Freshman class without further 
examination. If all that are established were thoroughly efficieut, 
many of the difficulties would be removed and the problem of ob- 
taining properly prepared students for the University would be 
solved. To further this work we stand ready at all times to send 
out teachers who may assist in elevating the schools and rendering 
them efficient.
-P-A-G-E-232
—229— 
The question of State education is truly a most serious one and 
requires the most mature thought, sense of adaptation and executive 
ability to secure the desired results. In order to be successful ed- 
ucational effort must have regard to environment. Ideals cannot 
be too high or too perfect, but in application practical results must 
be considered. While the University must have a definite policy 
with regard to its work, it is our earnest desire to keep in touch 
with al) the best thought of the State in every vocation of life, with 
a view of adjusting our efforts to the demands of the best citizenship. 
‘With the private schools, denominational schools, and all other 
schools of the State, we have maintained the most friendly rela- 
tions. Between these and us there is no antagonism. There will 
always be a demand for such schools, and they may be expected in 
the future, continuing, as in the past, to send us many of our best 
students. The graduates of the numerous smaller colleges and de- 
nominational schools of the State, which lack the facilities which a 
large endowment affords, will also find in our laboratories, libraries 
and museums, the opportunity to do additional work of a better and 
more advanced character. Properly conducted Normal schools 
may also become valuable feeders to the University, since such of 
their graduates as may desire to prepare themselves for higher work 
will find in our university course, including the higher studies in 
pedagogics, the preparation that they need. Whenever possible, it 
is our desire to co-operate with these and all other schools in ad- 
vancing, improving and unifying the work of education in the 
State. The superior advantages of a State university enable it to 
occupy the agreeable position of a helper, rather than that of rival, 
of other schools. 
The exhibit of the University at the Cotton States and Inter- 
national Exposition, at Atlanta, Ga., was a complete success. The 
Board of Awards bestowed a gold medal upon the exhibit. The 
exhibit was prepared, so far as the limited space would permit, to 
illustrate, first, the history of the University, and secondly, the 
workings of the institution. The latter were shown by work done 
by students in the drawing department, the department of mechanic 
arts, and the laboratories of botany, zoology, chemistry and physics. 
Necessarily only a few specimens from each of the departments 
were shown, but it is hoped they represented in a fitting manner 
the work done by the students. Every thing in the exhibit, with 
   
-P-A-G-E-233
—230— 
the exception of the photographs, the collection of mushrooms, the 
printed books, and the furniture, was the work of members of the 
University, for the most part students. The exhibit was installed 
and the space decorated by members of the University. A group 
of pictures, made from old wood-cuts and photographs, showed the 
buildings of the University as they appeared at various stages in 
its history. There were photographs of Governors Blount and 
Sevier, and of the monument erected to the latter by a grateful 
people. Some portraits of the early presidents were exhibited. 
Interesting relies were the old college bell (1827) and a part of the 
pen which served as a weather vane on Old College, and which was 
perforated by shot at the battle of Fort Sanders, when the belfry 
was said to have been occupied by Federal sharp-shooters. Con- 
trasted with this, in the center of the floor, and on the opposite 
wall, was an exhibit intended to illustrate some of the work of the 
University at the present time. This consisted of a series of pho- 
tographs of buildings and interiors of laboratories, shops, ete., as 
follows: Specimens of models and machines built by students in 
the department of mechanic arts; a small collection of plants, 
mounted by members of the University, illustrating the work in 
the herbarium; a collection of insects and alcoholic specimens, 
illustrating the work in the department of zoology ; a collection of 
food samples, analyzed by members of the chemical department in 
a recent study of the dietary of a students’ boarding club at the 
University ; a collection of photographs, illustrating the work of 
the horticultural department ; some specimens of apparatus, built 
by students of the physical department; specimens illustrating the 
courses of study in free-band and mechanical drawing ; a collection 
of old diplomas of the University ; seals of the departments of the 
National Government, and autographs of distinguished Americans, 
with a series of photographs intended to illustrate the workings of 
the University library, etc. The student organizations of the Uni- 
versity were represented by a group of pictures, showing the 
members of the literary societies during 1894, and by a picture of 
the Young Men’s Christian Association building, erected by sub- 
scription, at a cost of $20,000. The central location of the space 
made the exhibit prominent, and the effect of the exhibit itself has 
been such as to attract much attention to the University. 
In consideration of its educative value, the faculty gave the
-P-A-G-E-234
——231— 
entire body of students one week, from November 11 to 17, in 
which to visit the Exposition, One hundred and twenty students, ~ 
besides a number of the faculty, availed themselves of this oppor- 
tunity to see this great Southern exhibition. There can be no 
question that the time allowed for this trip was well spent, and that 
the students profited by it more than they would have done had 
they remained at work. 
A CENTENNIAL EXHrzIT. 
There is no branch of State government, and no institution in 
the State so intimately connected with the history of the origin of 
the State of Tennessee, as is the University of Tennessee. The 
University was born with the territory which preceded the State, 
was strengthened and confirmed by the organization of the State, 
and has grown as the people of Tennessee have grown and the State 
government has developed. A celebration of the centennial of the 
State is thus, of necessity, a celebration of the centennial of the 
University itself. If the State government has not recognized this 
jutimate association, and has not done for the institution in recent 
years what it should have done, it is in no sense the fault of the 
institution, or of the board of trustees who managed it. The Uni- 
versity has always been loyal to the State to which it belongs and 
from which it took its name, and has been doing for one hundred 
years a large part of the work of giving higher education ‘to its 
sons and, very recently, to its daughters also. For the last twenty- 
five years it has done this free of charge for tuition. The duty of 
the institution to itself, as well as to the State, requires that the 
management of the institution should do every thing in its power 
to support and assist a proper celebration of the centennial of the 
organization of the State of Tennessee. By the publication of its 
history by Professor Karns, in Merriam’s “ Higher Education in 
Tennessee,” and the alumni address delivered by Mr. HE. T. San- 
ford, at Commencement of 1894, the University has already done 
a great deal to promote the study of the early history of Tennessee. 
But this is not sufficient. It should make the very best exhibit it 
can, illustrating that history, and especially the history of the insti-_ 
tution from which it has derived its charters and its powers, and 
setting before the people the public services of the institution in the 
past, together with its present organization and equipment. é
-P-A-G-E-235
—232— 
- It is earnestly recommended therefore, that this board direct its 
faculty to begin at once to prepare an exhibit illustrating the history 
of the University, the work accomplished by it for the State, and 
its present organization and equipment for service, and make an 
appropriation to cover the expenses of the same. 
With regard to buildings and grounds there is nothing very im- 
portant to report. The usual repairs and regular improvements 
have been constantly made. Owing to the gradual dilapidation of 
the old dormitories, our need for better accommodations in this line 
becomes constantly more pressing. I would recommend, as the 
most practicable measure to supply this demand, the remodeling of 
North College, which is the best building on the grounds that can 
be used for dormitory purposes. This improvement may be 
effected by adding another story to the building, which would 
furnish accommodations for about twenty-four more students. A 
new front should be erected, and the whole interior renewed, in- 
cluding fixtures for steam heat and water. 
The attendance is increasing at Knoxville College. Good work 
is being done there. The equipment has been improved by the 
introduction of a large dynamo in order to light six additional 
buildings on the grounds. The total expense, including wires and 
lamps, was about $1,100. A cylinder press, job press, paper cutter 
and type have also been added to the printing outfit. Industrial 
education is the most important and valuable education for the negro. 
We should train him to be a good, self-supporting citizen first, and 
educate him as a teacher or preacher afterward. The great ma- 
jority of the negroes cannot be professional men, but must be self- 
supporting citizens. 
It has always been our policy to encourage athletics within 
proper bounds. Physical culture, in its place, is as important as 
intellectual culture. The University has furnished a first-class gym- 
nasium, where all the demands of culture in that line are satisfied. 
Few institutions have done more for the physical training of their 
students. In addition to the gymnasium we have a splendid mili- 
tary department, in which the members of the Freshman and 
Sophomore classes have training in tactics for about six months of 
the year. However, the athletic feature has its difficulties, as well 
as its successes. Most institutions where this feature has been ex- 
tensively developed are compelled to guard against the professional
-P-A-G-E-236
—233— 
spirit, which tends to confine the benefits to a few students who pose 
as trained specialists, and whose time is largely absorbed by sport, 
to the detriment of their studies. Athletics can be considered a 
perfect success only when a large part of the student-body can be 
personally engaged in the various games. When we consider 
present tendencies in athletics in the larger institutions, the ques- 
tion naturally arises whether it may not be better to substitute 
oratorical and other intellectual contests for these physical contests, 
as better suited to the entertainment of scholars, and more in accord 
with the principles and ideas of an educational institution. 
The Young Men’s Christian Association has proven itself one of 
the most important factors for good works in the University. The 
magnificent building which now adorns our grounds, and proves 
such a boon to the student-body, has shown itself well worthy the 
hard struggle which it cost. With its library, reception rooms, 
reading room, and various other attractions, it affords to students 
all the comforts and advantages of a regular club-house, in which 
all the bad features are eliminated. The building is fitted up with 
every modern convenience, and many students take rooms in certain 
portions set apart for that purpose. The Association reports its 
membership as follows: Active, sixty-nine; associate, forty-one ; 
sustaining, seventeen; It is in a very prosperous condition. The 
rent of the lodging-rooms, it is hoped, will soon furnish the means 
for extinguishing what debt remains upon the building. Religious 
services are held in the Association chapel at regular intervals, and 
are doing much to strengthen and build up a pure Christian man- 
hood among the student-body. 
Respectfully submitted, 
CHaries W. DaBNey, JR., 
President.

REPORT OF THE DEAN. 
Dr. Charles W. Dabney, Jr., President University of Tennessee : 
Dear Srr—In submitting another annual report I have little to 
add to the preceding one. There has been the same diligent and 
vigorous activity on the part of the teachers, and the same responsive 
and successful effort on the part of the large majority of our students. 
You will see from the detailed reports of departments their present 
conditions and needs. 
ADMISSION OF STUDENTS. 
Candidates for entrance to the University are admitted upon writ- 
ten examinations held here in June and September, and at various 
points throughout the State during thesummer. The questions are 
all given out from the University, and the papers are inspected by 
the respective professors. I am guided by the reports of these in 
admitting or excluding. A goodly number of those who apply are 
found to be unprepared. 
T suggest that, in addition to what is said in the catalogue, you 
haye a large number of circulars printed and distributed on this 
subject setting forth clearly and in detail our requirements for ad- 
mission. The correspondence indicates that many do not read the 
catalogue at all, or, if so, the statements are not explicit enough. 
The course laid down for secondary schools would be sufficient if 
the work were thoroughly done. Add to this two years of good 
drill in Latin (for the Latin Scientific course) and one in Greek also 
(for the Literary course), and the student could enter the Freshman 
class in any course offered. 
This is not the place for immature and ill-prepared boys, and 
parents are advised that the fact of being barely able to pass the 
technical examination set for entrance is poor preparation. Such 
boys will do much better in a good training school. The conditions 
here necessitate forms of government, methods of instruction, etc., 
wholly unsuitable to them. 
Rerorts To Parents. 
At intervals of six weeks reports of the standing of students are 
sent to parents and guardians. It is-our purpose to make these ac-
-P-A-G-E-241
—238— 
eurately and frankly, so that, within the limits of our knowledge, 
they may be confidently replied upon. 
ACCREDITED SCHOOLS. 
Nothing has contributed more to the improvement of our Fresh- 
man material than the schools which have been accredited and are 
now sending us their pupils. Candidates recommended by the 
principals of these are allowed to enter the Freshman class without 
examination, but only the Freshman. Applicants for higher stand- 
ing are subject to examination for classification. We desire to 
foster these high schools by every means in our power, fully assured 
that the interests of the University, as of the real education of 
the young people of the State, are involved in the success. But 
on account of the smal! number capable and willing to do this es- 
sential work properly, we find ourselves sorely perplexed. If we 
admit students that ought to be in them, the schools are damaged 
and discouraged. If we fix a standard that will exclude all such, 
we are liable to the charge of putting the benefits of the University 
out of reach of those for whom it was intended. But the best good 
of all the people lies in building and sustaining these high schools, 
and insisting that they do thoroughly this preparatory work, and 
do not attempt what they are not in a condition to accomplish. 
Women SrupEnvs. 
The third year of this experiment makes it apparent that, though 
under present conditions there are not a great many girls who are 
able and willing to undergo the exactions of the work here, there 
are some to whom the opportunity is welcome. Between forty and 
fifty have attended each year. Asa whole, they have proven most 
worthy and successful students. They board with friends and ac- 
quaintances in the city. A building is set apart for their occupancy 
during the day while not engaged in the lecture-rooms. In other 
respects no distinction is made between them and other students. 
What we have said above of immature and ill-prepared boys is 
doubly true of girls. But to all those earnest young women who 
want the benefits of the higher education, either as a culture or an 
equipment for making their own way in life, we extend a cordial 
welcome. Surely the Legislature of Tennessee cannot much longer 
refuse to appropriate the money for a building suitable to their 
needs.
-P-A-G-E-242
—239— 
ORDER AND GOVERNMENT. 
The methods of government still conform to the theory with 
which I set out when the control of the students was assigned to 
me five years ago, viz.: That a university is not a reformatory for 
bad boys; that the large majority of those who come here desire 
to study, and should not be interfered with or interrupted by those 
who do not; that young men can be appealed to effectively on the 
side of their manhood and sense of propriety ; that an incorrigible 
to whom such appeal is vain, should not be allowed to stay here ; 
that the only discipline worthy of the name is that which secures a 
genuine self-respect and true regard for the rights and feelings of 
others ; and that for this a mass of detailed rules are a hindrance 
and not a help. ; 
Our success on this line has been most gratifying. Orderly de- 
portment is well-nigh universal. There is no hazing or rudeness 
to new students, none of the petty, vexatious misdemeanors that 
so often mar college life. It is a pleasure to live and work here. 
The faculty has co-operated with me heartily in every endeavor to 
call our students up to a higher plane of moral and intellectual life. 
Wherein I have made mistakes the professors have generously over- 
looked or promptly aided in correcting them. 
Ture Datty Routine. 
Lectures and laboratory work begin at 8 o’clock a.M., and ex- 
tend to 4 o’clock P.M., with an intermission of from one to two. 
o’clock for dinner. Class work stops at 1 o’clock P.M. on Saturday. 
Each professor notes absentees and delinquents on a card suitably 
prepared. These cards, at the close of the day, are deposited in a 
box near my office. In another box students deposit, on blanks 
furnished them, their excuses or explanations. The first work on 
coming to my office is to compare these, accept or reject excuses, 
and have results recorded. Where explanations are unsatisfactory 
or delinquencies repeated, the offender is spoken to in person. 
This method enables me to keep in touch with all the work. 
When it is found that a student cannot or will not do the work, or 
is in any way an injury to the University, and will not promptly 
reform, his parents are quietly asked to withdraw him. No humil- 
iating penalty is resorted to, except in extreme cases. 
Respectfully submitted, 
T. W. Jorpan, Dean.

THIRTIETH ANNUAL MEETING 
OF THE 
Tennessee State Teachers’ Association, HELD AT 
FRANKLIN, TENN,, JULY 30-31, 1895. 
TuEspAY AFTERNOON, July 30, 1895. 
The thirtieth annual session of the Tennessee State Teachers’ 
* Association was formally opened in the chapel of the Tennessee 
Female College at 2:30 o’clock. Every seat in the large hall was 
filled with prominent educators from all portions of the State, and 
there were many of Franklin’s leading citizens present. On the plat- 
form were seated Prof. 8. A. Mynders, of Jackson, President, and 
Prof. Frank Goodman, of Nashville, Secretary. Among others on 
the platform were State Superintendent of Public Instruction 8. G. 
Gilbreath, ex-State Superintendent W. R. Garrett, ex-State Super- 
intendent Frank M. Smith, Superintendent J. C. Brooks of Cov- 
ington, and Geo. H. Armistead, editor of the Review and Appeal, 
of Franklin, together with Rev. John P. McFerrin. 
Supt. Brooks called the meeting to order, and the same was 
opened with prayer by Dr. McFerrin. 
Then followed a solo by Miss Jane Fowlkes. 
ADDRESS OF WELCOME. 
Hon. George H. Armistead, of the Review-Appeal, captured the 
visitors with a most eloquent and cordial address of welcome, of 
which it is impossible to give a full report, or even a synopsis. In 
discussing the progress of the educational movement in the South, 
the speaker adduced new and striking facts. Since the war, he 
said, the Southern States had appropriated nearly $400,000,000 for 
public schools, about $60,000,000 of which had gone to the negro, 
and last year the appropriations for both races had aggregated 
about $17,000,000. He called attention to the notable circumstance 
that during the last decade the percentage of enrollment in the 
public schools in proportion to population had increased in every
-P-A-G-E-247
—244— 
Southern State, and had decreased in every State east of the Mis- 
sissippi and north of the Ohio. 
“As for Tennessee,” he said, “it has as many schools of liberak 
art as Alabama, Arkansas, Virginia and Florida combined ; of law, 
as Louisiana, Mississippi, Kentucky and West Virginia; of medi- 
eine, as Texas, North and South Carolina; seven times as many 
theological schools as Texas, and as many schools for women as 
Florida, Texas and South Carolina. The percentage of enrollment 
in the public schools of Tennessee is equaled only by Kansas, Iowa 
and Mississippi, and in the last decade grew at a faster ratio than 
An any State in the South, and in 1890 the enrollment in Tennessee 
was larger than in any Southern State.” 
RESPONSE TO ADDRESS OF WELCOME. 
In the absence of Prof. G. M. Savage, Prof. C. L. Hayes, of 
Lebanon, responded to the address of weleome. The substance of 
the response was as follows : 
Mr. Chairman, Fellow-Teachers, Ladies and Gentlemen: There 
is one consoling thought in this situation. It is this: Had I been 
notified a year ago that I would have this response to make I could 
not have prepared in advance a reply which would have done jus- 
tice to the eloquent address of the gentleman who has welcomed us. 
He has shown by his interest and by his familiarity with educa- 
tional data that he deserves to be at least an emeritus member of 
the Tennessee State Teachers’ Association. Therefore, on behalf 
of the members of this association, I welcome him to a full enjoy- 
ment of all its privileges and honors. 
It is useless for me to say that we appreciate the welcome you have 
given us. You have a wonderfully productive country, a beautiful 
city and a cultured people, with plenty of enterprise, as such insti- 
tutions as this in which we meet so plainly show. But for other 
reasons we delight to come to Franklin. It was here that the gal- 
lant Cleburne fell, and beside him hundreds of others as brave as he, 
if not as illustrious. Who would not feel an inspiration when 
walking on ground hallowed by the blood of such heroes! 
We represent every school interest in the State. Though the 
number present is comparatively small, we must remember that 
there are more than 8,000 faithful co-workers whose hearts are in 
the cause which we represent. There are here teachers represent-
-P-A-G-E-248
—245— 
ing 100, perhaps 500 of their immediate pupils. There are County” 
Superintendents representing at least 100 teachers and 10,000 
children each. There are here representatives of great colleges, 
universities and private schools. Behind me sit the State - 
Superintendent of Public Schools and two ex-State Superin- 
tendents—the representatives of over 500,000 children. Hence, I 
feel safe in saying that every educational interest in the State is rep-- 
resented here to-day, and, if history repeats itself, will be affected by 
our deliberations. Take the records of the proceedings of this as- 
sociation for the last thirty years and place them side by side with 
the educational enactments of our Legislatures, and you will dis- 
cover a remarkable relation existing between them. Legislators, 
we believe, will, in the future as in the past, continue to look to 
this body for wisdom in matters affecting the educational interests 
of the State of Tennessee. 
Having thanked you for your cordial welcome, I now welcome 
you to all our meetings with like cordiality. 
A vocal solo, “The Song that Reached My Heart,” was beauti- 
fully sung by Miss Hattie Gamble. 
PRESIDENT MYNDERS’ ADDRESS. 
The President of the Association, Prof. S. A. Mynders, of Jack- 
son, delivered the annual address, which follows: 
“The first duty of the teacher is in the school-room, shaping and 
directing the destinies of those committed to his immediate care, 
watching the development of their faculties, and carefully selecting 
the material for their growth, administering to their intellectual — 
necessities, and carefully pruning from their natures injurious ten- 
dencies and habits. Truly ‘physicians of the mind and surgeons 
of the soul.’ Yet he has other responsibilities and duties. His 
influence must be felt outside of the school-room, as well as within 
that sacred sanctuary. He must guide and inform public sentiment 
in all that relates to education. He must be the high-priest of his 
profession, thoroughly informed in its nature, means and ends. 
Since education is his calling, he should comprehend it in all of its 
relations. The interests of the nation demand this. In no one 
thing is the influence that arises from thorough culture and study 
on the part of the teacher more necessary than in shaping educa- 
tional legislation. Our representatives, as well as the people, are
-P-A-G-E-249
—246— 
absorbed in the consideration of questions affecting their material 
interests. Asa rule they have neither the specific information nor 
disposition requisite to progressive legislation upon a subject so 
foreign to their usual course of thought, and demanding such pro- 
found and careful study. The cause of education needs leaders 
competent to command success. For these leaders, it must look to 
those who are especially set apart to promote and defend it. To 
the teachers of this country this great duty belongs. The individual 
leader can accomplish but little. Our forces must be united, and 
to teachers in associated capacities must we look for leadership in 
bringing about plans for the promotion of our great cause. 
“From these considerations arises the necessity for such associa- 
ions as that to which we have the honor to belong. The framers of 
our constitution wisely gave as one of the objects of the Tennessee 
State Teachers’ Association: ‘To promote the cause and elevate the 
standard of education.’ As we meet in this our thirtieth annual 
session we can justly point with pride to the work accomplished in 
this direction. The inception of our public school system, its de- 
velopment and history, has been influenced largely by this organ- 
ization. Many towns and cities can give credit to you for the 
influence that led to the establishment of their graded schools. 
Our institutes and schools for the training of teachers have found 
here encouragement and help. At every annual meeting plans 
have been laid and suggestions given that have been woven into 
the systems of these institutions, and helped to make them what 
they are. While the public schools have been the objects of special 
care, the private schools and institutions for higher education haye 
found here a firm friend. We have taught that the interests of 
public and private schools are not antagonistic, but mutual. The 
one helps the other, and both have a plice and work to perform in 
our educational system. They must work together to bring about 
that universal education so essential to the prosperity of our great 
country. My predecessor, in his annual address, so ably reviewed 
the history and work of this Association that a brief reference is 
all that is necessary for me. 
‘‘ Education in Tennessee is to-day standing upon a higher plane 
than ever before. The true teacher’s work is more highly appre- 
ciated. The teacher’s profession is regarded as one of the highest 
and most honorable, and it requires neither ‘a prophet nor son of
-P-A-G-E-250
—247— 
a prophet’ to see that in Tennessee in the near future teaching will 
cease to be regarded as a ‘ stepping-stone to other professions,’ but 
that ambitious and worthy young men and women will esteem 
merited distinction in its ranks as worthy of their highest aims and 
noblest efforts. The grading of our public schools is being rapidly 
accomplished, and the law creating secondary schools has placed in 
the reach of the children of Tenneésee facilities for a liberal common 
school education. Our Peabody Normal College, at Nashville, and 
system of Institutes are doing much to supply the demand for bet- 
ter equipped teachers. Our universities have advanced their course 
of study and requirements for entrance. Uxcellent preparatory 
and training schools are being established in all parts of the State, 
and they are doing a work that no other schools ezn do. They are 
a very important factor in our educational system, and we must 
recognize them. They merit our most hearty approval and en- 
couragement. 
“At our last meeting resolutions were adopted favoring the estab- 
lishment of a chair of American history in our higher institutions 
of learning. It is with pleasure that I refer to the fact that our 
last General Assembiy, recognizing the merits of these sug- 
gestions, made an appropriation to sustain such a chair in 
the Peabody Normal College, and the State Board of Education 
promptly elected Hon. W. R. Garrett to the position. Had the 
election been left to this Association, I believe I can safely say the 
same selection would have been made by a unanimous vote. I 
recommend that such action be taken as will express our satisfac- 
tion of this action of the General Assembly and State Board of 
Education, and lend every possible encouragement toward the main- 
tenance of the chair, and accomplishment of its important work. 
“The public school system of Tennessee places great responsi- 
bilities upon the counties, and it rests largely with the teachers to 
educate public sentiment, and influence the action of County Courts 
in their respective counties, hence the demand for county teachers’ 
associations. There is a wide difference between the Institute and 
Association. We are beginning to realize that one of the best 
methods of teaching how to teach is by example. The branches 
required to be taught in our common schools must be taught, more 
or less, in the Institutes, and in them there is little time for the 
consideration of general educational topics, needed legislation, etc.
-P-A-G-E-251
—248— 
This must be left to Teachers’ Associations, which are, more strictly 
speaking, voluntary deliberative bodies. Their objects are of a more 
general nature than those of the Institute. Their aim is to discuss 
those principles and questions of policy which relate to the organ- 
ization and administration of a system of education. We note with 
pleasure that many counties have such organizations. Other coun- 
ties should be organized as rapidiy as possible, and this Association 
should encourage the work. I recommend that a committee be 
appointed to draft a plan for the organization of county associa- 
tions, and that some plan be devised for giving them representation 
in the State Association. While it is true that all teachers and 
friends of education are entitled to membership here, yet if the 
County Associations were called upon to send special representatives, 
I believe our attendance would be made more general. 
“Tennessee needs some Institute legislation. The uncertainty 
of securing funds for the support of Institutes, under the present 
system, must be keenly felt. We are dependent upon each General 
Assembly for an appropriation, and there is always a wrangle, and 
their action is uncertain. As we will have another annual meeting 
before the meeting of the next General Assembly, I recommend 
that a committee be appointed to suggest needed legislation on this 
subject, and report at our next meeting. 
“The Tennessee Centennial Exposition, to be held in Nashville 
next year, needs your help. It is intended to be a great school 
where the world will be taught the great resotirces of Tennessee, 
its history, development and grandeur. Our schools must take an 
important part. We have universities, colleges, academies, semi- 
naries and common schools that can make an exhibit equal to that 
of any State in the Union, and it should be made. This meeting 
should take such action as will insure a success and secure the great- 
est possible benefit to the schools of the State. 
“The improvement in the schools and advancement in educa- 
tional sentiment among our people demands that teachers ‘should 
keep abreast with the times,’ and use every means in their power 
to advance their attainments and contribute to the welfare of their 
profession. The cry is for better teachers. These are not to be im- 
ported, but those already in the field are to be made better. Our 
County and State Institutes are doing a great work in this direc- 
tion, but we can help them. They must be inspired with a higher
-P-A-G-E-252
—-249—— 
‘ideal of scholarship and a longing for greater proficiency. The 
teacher must not only be a scholar, but he must possess a rich fund 
of general intelligence. He cannot afford to be narrow-minded or 
short-sighted. He must be well versed in everything that pertains 
to his profession, and must be a man of general culture. It seems 
to me that a State Teachers’ Reading Circle, with a board of di- 
rectors and general secretary, should be established. It should be 
the duty of this board to suggest the course of reading, correspond 
with the County Superintendents and County Associations, and 
through them effect the organization of reading circles in every 
county in the State. The benefits would be manifold. Besides 
promoting professional and literary culture of teachers, it would 
establish and maintain strong bonds of fraternalism by the system- 
atic study of subjects of common interest. This association should 
take the initiative step and place the management in competent 
hands. 
I have made the improvement of our teaching force the central 
thought of my suggestions. I believe the demands of the times 
justify it, for upon the teachers of our State, more than upon any 
and all other classes combined, devolves the solution of the problem 
of a wise and generous education for the entire people. We may 
erect grand school edifices; we may increase the school fund; we 
may endow magnificent institutions; but without educated and 
skillful teachers our efforts for universal education will be in vain- 
Buildings, apparatus and endowments are but inert machinery ; the 
power resides in the faithful teacher alone. He must breathe into 
these the animated breath of life. 
“To you, as the leaders of educational thought in Tennessee, is 
brought the duty of providing plans for the improvements men- 
tioned. How will your work be done? 
“ With a just pride in the achievements of the past and strong hope 
for the future, let us undertake the solution of the problems before 
us, and make the thirtieth annual meeting of the State Teachers’ 
Association of Tennessee memorable for work done for the glory 
and welfare of our great commonwealth.” 
During the reading of the address President Mynders was inter- 
rupted several times by applause, the Association evidently being 
in hearty accord with the same.

Upon motion of Secretary Goodman, the President was requested 
te appoint committees, to take into consideration each of the re- 
commendations contained in the President’s address. 
Next came a vocal solo by Miss Bertha Baugh. 
The President stated that he would announce the various com- 
mittees in the morning. : 
The first session closed with an interesting recitation, “The

GRADING OF CITY SCHOOLS. 
Capt. W. R. Garrett delivered an address on “Grading of City 
Schools.” It was a most entertaining and instructive one, the cul- 
tured gentleman showing conclusively the many advantages arising 
from a system of city graded schools. The large chapel of the col- 
lege was crowded, and the remarks of Capt. Garrett made a deep ~ 
impression upon those of the citizens assembled. Franklin has no 
graded public schools, and the lecture, together with the other bene- 
ficial effects of the Association meeting, will doubtless add a decided 
impetus to the movement looking to an organized effort at having 
a city graded free school, and it is to be hoped that it will only be 
a matter of comparatively short time before this little city will have 
the graded school. 
Recitation—Miss Alma Andersion.

How to Brine ScHoots AnD CoLLEGES INTO HaRMoNY 
with Kacu OTHER. 
Secretary Goodman read a letter from Prof. J. I. D. Hinds, ex- 
plaining why he was unavoidably prevented from being present, 
and informing the Association that he had sent his paper by Prof. 
J. E. Bailey. 
On motion of Prof. C. L. Hayes the rules, through courtesy to 
Prof. Hinds, were suspended, and the paper was read by Prof. W. 
_ J. Grannis, supplemented by an explanation by Prof: J. E. Bailey. 
The subject of the paper was, “ How to Bring Schools and Colleges 
into Harmony with Each Other.” 
The paper created a warm discussion, in which a number of 
members took part. It was claimed the paper contained inaccura- 
cies in reference to the public school work and the results that were 
being accomplished. The paper was referred to a committee con- 
sisting of Profs. H. D. Huffaker, W. J. Grannis, and G. R. Me- 
Gee. The committee reported that, according to the rules of the 
Association, the paper could not be accepted or published, on ac-

count of the author not being present, and the Association unani- 
mously indorsed the report of the committee. 
Recitation—“‘Spelling”—by Miss Jarman. 
Screntiric AGRICULTURE IN THE PusBLic ScHOOLS. 
Maj. T. F. P. Allison, Commissioner of Agriculture of Tennes- 
see, presented the subject of “Scientific Agriculture in the Public 
Schools,” in a manner that pleased the audience and convinced the 
members that this was a valuable acquisition to the course of study 
in the schools of the State. 
It is only possible to give a short resume of what Maj. T. F. 
P. Allison said. He began by saying that we all acknowledge 
that agriculture is the ground sill on which all others rest. While 
it would not be expedient to teach the art, science, and method 
of farming in common schools, yet it would be proper that all 
the sciences which underlie and relate to farming should be taught 
to every child. As the farmer is continually communing with 
nature, it is but reasonable to suppose the more he knows of 
nature’s laws and works the more he will enjoy his work. The 
farmer, as he goes to his daily work, would derive mental profit 
and pleasure in being able to name and give the history of the dif- 
ferent plants that border his pathway or spread over his fields. 
Intelligence is the farmer’s best implement and best hand and 
fertilizer. It caanot supply the place of capital but it may double 
its value. Parents, children, teachers, and school authorities, all 
have a right to be heard as to the text-books and the branches to 
to be studied in the common country schools. Probably it would 
not be wise to make the study of agriculture compulsory, but the 
privilege of having their children educated with a view of fitting 
them for their future occupation, would be to farmers of great 
value. 
Some knowledge of agriculture will be no drawback but rather 
an advantage to any boy, whatever calling he may follow. Ifa 
boy chooses farming, or if his parents intend, if life’s uncertainties 
permit, that he shall be a farmer, that boy’s education ought to be 
planned and shaped with that end in view. A farmer’s education 
“is never completed by the completion of any course of study. 
The agricultural press was never so powerful, far-reaching and 
influential as it is now. Through this means the experience of all
-P-A-G-E-256
—253— 
becomes the property of all. The Federal and State governments, 
through their departments of agriculture and experimental stations, 
are constantly studying subjects relating to farming, and publishing 
the results. The services of the ablest scientists are enlisted in 
these efforts, and all for the benefit of the farmers. 
Ex-Snperintendent Frank M. Smith introduced to the Associa- 
tion his successor, State Superintendent S. G. Gilbreath. 
Supt. Gilbreath said he was glad to meet with the Association, 
and appreciated the introduction that had been given him by Supt. 
Smith, as to Mr. Smith was great credit due for much of the good 
results that had been accomplished by the public school system. 
He expressed his pleasure and interest in all the papers presented 
and felt that criticism was always good if merited. 
In the discussion between Supt. Smith and Dr. Kirkland, two 
extremes had been represented, one from the public school side, the 
other from a university standpoint; both looking to a happy me- 
dium, which is always safe ground. There is a higher purpose than 
passing students to high schools, and that is the preparation for life, 
and that should be the highest motive of all teaching. Supt. Gil- 
breath also expressed a deep interest in Tennessee’s coming Cen- 
tennial celebration, claiming it could be made a power for the cause 
of education in Tennessee. Every teacher should take a personal 
interest in it. He suggested that some suitable action should be 
taken by the Association, and that the Centennial authorities 
should be called upon to give recognition to this Association by 
representation on its Board of Directors. Snpt. Gilbreath’s talk 
was most flatteringly received. 
WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON SESSION. 
Association called to order at 2:30 o’clock by President Mynders. 
Rey. J. P. McFerrin offered prayer. 
Music. 
The committee appointed to consider the suggestions contained 
in the President’s address relative to the Tennessee Centennial cel- 
ebration, reported as follows: 
TENNESSEE CENTENNIAL. 
We, your commitiee appointed upon the suggestion of the Presi-
-P-A-G-E-257
—254— 
dent relative to the Tennessee Centennial Exposition, beg to sub- 
mit the following : 
WuHeErxaAs, at the recent meeting of the National Educational As- 
sociation at Denver, Col., leading educators from all the Southern 
States held a meeting to consider the advisability of having the 
next meeting o! the Southern Educational Association in Atlanta, 
Ga., during the Cotton States and International Exposition ; and, 
Wuersas, there is to be an Educational Congress in Atlanta 
during the said Exposition and in connection with the same; and, 
Wuereas, the educators of Tennessee are interested in the suc- 
cess of said Atlanta Exposition, and especially the educational de- 
partment, its meetings and exhibits ; and, 
Wuereas, if the educators of Tennessee show a proper spirit of 
co-operation in said Exposition and its educational meetings this 
year, it is confidently hoped and expected that we can have the 
unanimous co-operation and support of the educators of the S:uth 
in our Tennessee Centennial Exposition ; therefore, be it 
Resolved, That we ask that at the week to he set apart for the 
meeting of the Southern Educational Association in Atlanta, that 
said week be also set apart by Tennessee, in order to give the edu- 
eators of our Siate an opportunity to be present at said meeting of 
the Southern Educational Association and the Educational Con- 
gress. 
Resolved further, That we consider it of the utmost importance 
that the educators of our State be given this opportunity to inspect 
the education exhibit to be shown at the Atlanta Exposition, and 
to mingle and co-operate with the educators of the South and of 
the nation. 
Resolved further, That the effect of a careful examination of the 
educational exhibit and co-operation with the educators of the 
South will enable the teachers of our State to more fully appreciate 
the importance of an extensive educational exhibit by the schools 
of the State to be used in our own Centennial Exposition. 
Resolved further, That we recommend that the State Superintend- 
ent of Public Instruction invite all boards of education and school 
officers to grant a vacation of one week to enable teachers and school 
officers to visit the Atlanta Exposition without loss of salary, said 
week to be announced by the State Superintendent. 
Resolved further, That one week be also asked for, to be known
-P-A-G-E-258
SESE 
as teachers’ week at the Tennessee Centennial, and that while the 
teachers of Tennessee are in attendance at the Atlanta Exposition, 
that they use every endeavor to secure a full representation of edu- 
eators to attend the Tennessee Centennial during teachers’ week, 
and also a full educational exhibit. 
Resolved further, That we ask that the educational interests of 
our State be properly represented in the Board of Directors of the 
Tennessee Centennial Exposition. 
Respectfully submitted. FRANK Goopmay, Nashville. 
8. G. Gingreata, Nashville. 
H. D. Hurraker, ‘Chattanooga. 
J. L. Brooxs, Jackson. 
In discussing the report, Chancellor Kirkland of Vanderbilt 
University, Prof. W. J. Grannis of Cumberland University, and 
the public and private school men and officials, pledged their hearty 
co-operation, whereupon the foregoing report was unanimously 
adopted, and it was ordered that the same committee be continued 
permanently to represent the Association and co-operate with the 
management of the Tennessee Centennial Exposition in all educa- 
tional matters ia which the Association may become interested, 
so the cause of education in Teunessee may be fully and properly 
represented. The committee was also authorized to represent the 
Association in connection with the Atlanta Cotton States Expo- 
sition. 
It may not be amiss to here insert the comment contained in one 
of Nashville’s leading daily papers in referring to the selection of 
the foregoing committee, and it may be a source of encouragement 
to any of our Tennessee educators who may not have a personal ac- 
quaintance with the members of the committee, to know that they 
have had some experience in the line of work for which they were 
appointed and have a hearty interest in the recognition and encour- 
agement that the educational interests of the State deserve. The 
extract follows: 
“The committee is composed of gentlemen of experience and who 
have the Centennial deeply at heart, and who will faithfully and 
intelligently represent the Association which has thus honored them. 
“The chairman of the committee, Prof. Frank Goodman, of 
Nashville, is to-day the possessor of a gold medal presented to him 
in 1874 by the management of the Nashville Exposition of that
-P-A-G-E-259
—256— 
year asa token of appreciation of his educational enthusiasm and’ 
enterprise. During the Nashville Centennial Exposition of 1880 he 
acted as assistant manager in the educational department, constantly 
co-operating with and assisting the manager, Supt. S. Y. Caldwell. 
In 1884 he was appointed by State Superintendent of Public In- 
struction Thomas H. Paine as Educational Commissioner for Ten- 
nessee at the World’s Industrial Centennial Exposition at New Or- 
leans. At the close of the exposition, Supt. Paine reported to Goy- 
ernor Bate and the Legislature: ‘ Prof. Goodman had full charge 
of gettiug up and supervising the educational exhibit of our State, 
This work he has well and faithfully done, and it is but simple jus- 
tice to him to state that without his presence and self-denying ef— 
forts, his tact and energy, the State would have been placed ina 
state of humiliating contrast with the great, well-organized and 
ably conducted represetatious made by the States of the Northwest, 
placed, as they were, immediately alonside our own exhibit. As a 
result of the persistent efforts of Prof. ‘Goodman, the visitors who 
thronged the Exposition had before them a very creditable exhibi- 
tion of school work, from the primary grades to the college and. 
university, offered as an evidence of what Tennessee has accom- 
plished, afid an earnest of still greater results in the near future.’ 
“Hon. 8. G. Gilbreath, the second named on the committee, is 
the recently appointed State Superintendent of Public Instruction, a 
gentleman who has at once found a warm place in the hearts of all 
the educators with whom he has come in official contact. At every 
educational gathering he is commending the Centennial, and in a 
forcible and eloquent manner is pleading its cause and is succeeding 
in arousing great enthusiasm. He heartily pledges his best efforts 
and hearty co-operation in behalf of the Centennial, and will devote- 
his best energies to have the educational interests properly repre- 
sented at the coming Centennial. 
“Supt. H. D. Huffaker, of Chattanooga, the third man on the com- 
mittee, has been Superintendent of Hamilton County public schools 
for a number of years, and has the reputation of being “ the best 
County Supérintendent in the State’? He was the first Superin- 
tendent in Tennessee to organize a county educational exhibit, and 
has had for several years most creditable exhibitions, which have 
never been equaled in the State. Superintendent Huffaker is also 
editor of the Southern School, an educational journal, which is pub--
-P-A-G-E-260
—257— 
lished weekly, so the committee can have weekly communication — 
with the educators of the State and the South. 
“Prof. J. L. Brooks, of Jackson, Principal of the High School, — 
is the West Tennessee member of the committee, a young, active, 
_ energetic educator, and while not as weil known in Middle Tenues- 
see, he was unanimously recommended by the West Tennessee edu- 
cators in attendance at Franklin, and they assured the Association 
that he would, if need be, visit every city and town in West Ten- 
nessee in the interest of the educational department of the Centen- 
nial Exposition. 
“Thus it will be seen that the Tennessee State Teachers’ Associ- 
ation carefully took into consideration the qualifications of those 
it should select as its representatives. No one need fear that the 
«dacational interests will be neglected.” j 
INVITATIONS TO HOLD NEXT MEETING, 
Prof. J. C. Brooks presented copies of strong resolutions, passed 
by the Board of Education and the Board of Mayor and Aldermen 
of Covington, cordially inviting the Association to hold its next 
annual session at Covington. He also joined in the invitation, and 
gave many plausible reasons why the next meeting should be held 
at Covington. 
Supt. Albert Ruth, in an interesting letter, extended a hearty in- 
vitation for the Association to hold its next meeting in Knoxville. 
Prof, J. A. Baher, of Huntingdon, made an esrnest plea for the 
Association to meet at Huntingdon in 1896. 
The three invitations were ordered referred to the Executive 
Committee for 1896, whose duty it is to decide upon the time and 
place for holding the next meeting, and doubtless many other invi- 
tations will be received before time to act. 
HONORARY MEMBERS. 
Upon motion of Secretary Goodman, Mr. George H. Armistead, 
of Franklin, was unanimously elected an honorary member of the 
Association, the announcement of which, made by the President, 
was heartily applauded. 
STATE READING CIRCLES. 
“The Committee on State Reading Circle, composed of W. J. 
17 f
-P-A-G-E-261
—258— 
Grannis, G. R. McGee, Jesse Tomlinson and James A. Cotton, sub- 
mitted the following report, which was adopted : 
Your committee on the subject of reading circles for the teachers 
of Tennessee would respectfully submit for your action the following : 
1. That an executive board of three members be appointed an- 
nually by the State Teachers’ Association, whose duty it shall be 
to organize reading circles throughout the State, select books to be 
read, appoint county committees and perform such other duties as 
may in their judgment be necessary for the success of this impor- 
tant work. 
2. That a membership fee of 10 cents be paid to the Secretary of 
the State Executive Board by each person joining these reading 
circles, to pay the necessary office expenses of the Secretary. 
3. That the State Executive Board for the coming year be com- 
posed of H. D. Huffaker, of Chattanooga; J. L. Wright of Nash- 
ville, and S. A. Mynders, of Jackson, Secretary. 
CHANCELLOR KIRKLAND’S ADDRESS. tp 
An address by Chancellor Kirkland, of Vanderbilt University, 
upon the subject of ‘‘ Education and Schools and School Work,” 
abounded with sound educational thought, containing as it did 
many valuable and original suggestions. It was considered one of 
the best addresses delivered before the Association, the Chancellor 
being frequently interrupted by hearty applause. 
It is to he regretted that the address was not prepared for this re- 
port, for it would have shown the educators of the State the cordial 
relations existing between the faculty of this great university and 
the public and private school teachers of the entire State. 
UNIFORMITY OF TEXT BOOKS. 
“Uniformity of Text Books, State and County,” was the subject 
of an able address by Prof. Jas. G. Meadors, Superintendent City 
Schools of McMinnville. Mr. Meadors said: 
“Tn appearing before you in the roll of a substitute, I desire to 
express for myself the regret which many of you doubtless feel in 
not being able to listen to-day to the very able and experienced 
gentleman whose place I have the signal honor and signal inability to 
fill, Apologies, however, I feel to be needless, for two most excel- 
lent reasons: First, because the very best substitute, even in rye
-P-A-G-E-262
—259— 
coffee war times, is never expected to be more than a remote re- 
semblance to the genuine article; and second, because the subject 
-assiened me has been so often before this Association within recent 
years that it has been argued threadbare before you, and by the 
repeated utterances of this body of representative teachers as fully 
-and clearly settled as any matter ever can be determined by such 
-@0 organization. 
“The Tennessee State Teachers’ Association is known throughout 
the South to be most unequivocally opposed to the adoption of any 
system of text-books by State Boards or Legislatures, mandatory 
for a term of years; is known further, to view with no particular 
favor the adoption of such a mandatory course by even county 
‘boards; and, finally, has always utterly refused to advocate, sanc- 
tion, or desire any legislation whatever on the subject of text- 
‘books. So thoroughly and so frequently has this subject been dis- 
-cussed by this Association, that I could hardly place before you a 
single idea not previously advanced herein, nor do I believe any 
thing could be said that would induce you to reverse, or perceptibly 
modify, that judgment which this Association passed years ago, and 
‘has since so repeatedly and persistently reaffirmed. In fact, since 
the birth of this organization, there has been no question before it 
whatever so distinctly, emphatically and unanimously decided, and 
‘in all the utterances, resolutions and records of this body, I find 
one long, consistent and persistent record of opposition to legisla- 
tive intermeddling with the text-book question, in whatsoever form 
-or shape. 
“The same is true of our other great educational organizations, 
the State Public School Officers’ Association, which, while asking - 
legislation yearly upon many other educational matters, has con- 
sistently urged the State Superintendents and Governors to suffer no 
text-book legislation if they could possibly help it. 
“Thus these two powerful educational organizations—the one 
embracing the public school officers and teachers of the entire State, 
the other including among its members the teachers of Tennessee 
of every class—from university presidents to district school ma’ams 
—have emphatically pronounced against any form of text-hook 
legislation every time the subject has come before them within my 
memory, and, as fer as I am able to learn, within anybody’s mem-
-P-A-G-E-263
—260— 
ory; and I desire to accentuate this fact, for I believe in magnily- 
ing my calling to its full deserts, and I wish to do honor to those 
who magnify it, though themselves filling other positions in life. 
When State Superintendents and Governors of Tennessee refuse 
to sanction school legislation because they believe the teachers of 
this State oppose it, and out of genuine deference to their opinions, 
I feel that the fact should be duly appreciated and publicly ac- 
knowledged by the teachers. I wear no man’s collar, and, while I 
- know nothing of law-making and comparatively little of my own 
trade, yet I firmly believe I am a better judge of a text-book than 
any member of the Tennessee Legislature who has not been for’ 
some years a practical teacher; better than any member of a State 
Board who never taught an hour; and considerably better than 
those members of county boards who are still prone to write God 
with a little “ge,” and would not know a grammar rule from a mule 
track if they metit in the road. With all deference to legislatures, 
county boards, and people of every estate and calling, I believe 
every self-respecting teacher in the country feels just as I do. 
“Now, I am reliably informed that last winter the State Super- 
intendent sent over two thousand letters to Tennessee teachers, and 
received nearly as many from them, relative to text-book legisla- 
tion ; and out of this large number of replies only a single teacher 
desired any text-book legislation, all being well content with the 
present school laws. Generally, it was again the cry of the con- 
servative barons: ‘We are unwilling to change the laws of Eng- 
land!’ When, now at the very beginning of the year, the atten- 
tion of the Governor was directed to this fact, I am told that he 
announced his reluctance to any school legislation at all, and when 
-certain legislation was attempted he refused his sanction simply 
because such a very large and respectable body of people who were 
vitally interested wished no such legislation at all, and he believed in 
the old maxim, ‘ Every man to his trade.’ 
“JT have nothing whatever to do with politics, but I do rejoice 
that the time has come when the Governor of a great State honestly 
respects the opinions and wishes of an honest, respectable and 
really intelligent class of citizens, and who really believes that peo- 
ple who have devoted their whole lives to a single work are more 
competent to judge its needs than even law-makers who never gave 
it half a serious thought till some rural constituent concluded to
-P-A-G-E-264
—261— 
console congressional grievances with national turnip seed, and leg— 
islative analogies with local dog laws and cheaper text-books ! 
“The merits of any recent legislation attempted on the text-book 
question need not be discussed here. It is not worth while to shoot 
dead game. Some of it was doubtless inspired by patriotic motives, 
‘some of it by that curious hankering after cheap notoriety, so dear 
to the soul of the petty politician; but the most of the furious 
agitation, witnessed twice during the spring sessions, undoubtedly 
originated with certain rival book companies, who are charged with 
maintaining, during the whole term of the last Legislature, power- 
ful and expensive lobbies, lavishly using money and viciously fo- 
menting legislation uncalled for by the times, unmentioned by the 
‘Governor in any message, undesired by the teachers, and wholly 
unsolicited by a great majority of the sober, intelligent people of 
‘Tennessee. 
“The State Superintendent may have shown poor judgment in 
consulting the teachers of the State upon the matter, and the Gov- 
ernor may have exhibited senility in thinking their views entitled 
to proper consideration, but somehow I cannot bring myself to 
either belief, and I sincerely trust that before this Association ad- 
journs it will take a proper notice of the facts I have thus sought 
to bring to your attention. 
“The general question of a mandatory course of text-books for 
aterm of years need not be discussed at much length before this 
body. The opposition to it here has always been so pronounced 
that I need only to summarize the objections heretofore repeatedly 
urged, and which obtains to-day as potently as ever before, if not 
more so. 
“1. We object to it on philosophical grounds, because it tends 
strongly toward centralization. We believe that, as far as practi- 
cable, the schools should remain under purely local control; nor 
do we think it advisable to educate our children in the belief that 
they are the wards of the State. Nota dollar is used to support 
the schools of a district the people themselves do not pay, and the 
people have consequently the right to expend it as they please ; and 
while it is perhaps allowable for the State to say what shall be 
taught in the schools, in a general way, it is rank paternalism for 
the State to prescribe the mode in which those subjects shall be
-P-A-G-E-265
—262— 
taught; and certainly the text-books constitute a part of the mode 
of instruction, and often a very considerable part. 
2. We view with jealousy any sort of encroachment of the State: 
upon the rights and liberties of all classes of citizens. The only 
reasons ever given in the world for adopting a mandatory course of 
text-books are that it is expedient and cheapens books. It is said 
_to be expedient because many school boards are not competent to 
select proper books. If so, the teachers they employ are not fit to 
teach, and could not teach those proper books; so it makes no dif- 
ference at last. But that it cheapens books materially we are in- 
clined to doubt; besides, dirt-cheap learning is like anything else: 
dirt-cheap—relatively valueless. This is a platitude that need not 
be argued further. But how is this cheapening of books to be se- 
cured? Generally by fixing the price at which they must be sold 
by publishers, and the profits a dealer shall be allowed to make! 
Books are a commodity, precisely as wheat, bacon, calico and quin- 
ine. Shall the State say, ‘No wheat shall be sold in this State for 
more than sixty cents per bushel; no druggist shall charge a profit 
of over 20 per cent. on quinine?’ Yet such things have been—but 
not in this republic! 
“3. We do not believe that much ‘cheaper’ books would be in 
the end more economical than at present. If furnished at a muck 
lower price than now, they would probably be by inferior authors, 
or of inferior material and construction. School books are really 
not exorbitantly dear. The contention that it is possible to save 
$100,000 annually to the people of the State is really no argument 
Generally the people who so clamorously demand cheaper books re- 
gard tobacco as a greater domestic necessity than school books. If 
do not doubt but the people of the State could save annually half a 
million dollars by using an inferior brand of tobacco, the contract 
being firmed out to a couple of manufacturers by the State, and 
material limited in price by law. I know one smoker who spent in 
a single year $100 for highly flavored cigars, and howled lustily for 
cheaper text-books as he smoked them! Let the State give this 
worthy citizen cheaper tobacco for his money, or he will come to 
beggary! Besides all this, it is a pernicious principle to actually 
ereate monopolies by law; and assuredly if book trusts are actually 
rich enough to buy up State legislatures—a thing by no means un- 
heard of—would they find much trouble in managing county boards?
-P-A-G-E-266
—263— 
The present law prevents that by allowing local hoards to change 
books at pleasure. 
“4, But our principal reason for opposing a mandatory course 
for a term of years is a professional one. At present the text-book 
question is practically in the hands of the teachers, where it legiti- 
mately belongs. Changes in text-books should be made at any 
time when it will conduce to the advancement of pupils, the in- 
creased power of the teacher, or the enlargement and growth of ed- 
ucational facilities. Better books are constantly being produced ; 
but to compel the use of a single ine of books for five years forces 
the thought of teachers into narrow grooves, and this mechanical 
system of instruction might make many thousand machine-made 
parodies, but not many genuine men and women really fit for citi- 
zenship. Books should be changed whenever they need to be 
changed, and it is unquestionably a fact that the best judge of that 
need is an honest, competent and energetic teacher, who has used 
the book with the pupil at the school. But many teachers are 
worthless, and are no fit judges! Pshaw! Legislate a little about 
who shall teach, who shall serve on school boards, who shall fill the 
office of County Superintendent—then will be the proper time to 
settle the text-book question, if ever. 
“©5. Again, we seriously doubt ifany State, with such a diversity 
of surface, minerals, products, climate, people, occupations-and be- 
liefs as Tennessee, can ever profitably use a uniform system of text- 
books, and we think this reason alone should suffice. This is really 
three States in one, each almost as different from the others as 
Maine from Texas. Tennessee is an empire within herself, and 
‘were the rest of the world to sink into the sea to-morrow, she and 
her people could subsist forever, and maintain unimpaired her pres- 
ent civilization. The course of study is even now loaded down 
with superfluities, in a frantic effort to satisfy the whimsical fads 
and sentiment of the times and meet the requirements of the various 
sections and their respective needs. As matters now stand, it is 
possible to practically teach this course, while the choice of text- 
books is still in the hands of local boards. One text-book is 
strong and full as to matters of vital and practical importance and 
interest in one section; another text-book on the same subject will 
better supply the need of another section. 
“ The imperial conditions which God has created in this State we
-P-A-G-E-267
—264— 
cannot change and do not want changed ; yet public school life and 
work are limited by too many things to attempt all things; there- 
fore local boards should be allowed to select text-books adapted to 
local environments, as the present law permits. The present school 
laws are good laws, faulty, not in their conception so much as in 
their enforcement, and needing only a rigid enforcement to secure 
most excellent results. ‘ 
“6. The public schools of Tennessee, all things considered and 
all conditions remembered, will compare most favorably with those 
of any State in the Union. It has been the policy of our peopie 
for twenty centuries to hold fast to the faith of the fathers in all 
things. We are still “unwilling to change the laws of England” 
till we are certain of getting better laws in their place. 
“ With the rampant paternalism, agrarianism and communism of 
the hour, the Anglo-Saxon South has no sympathy whatever. They 
are utterly foreign to the genius of our people—heresies hopelessly 
heathen and diabolically subversive of those mighty forces which 
have made and kept us world-rulers ever since Arminius led the 
blue-eyed barbarians against the Roman spears and whitened the 
German forests with a snow of Latin bones ! 
“ The State of Tennessee is not a merchant; nor are either State 
legislatures or county boards the paternal guardians of the people, 
to forceupon them things they may not want, yet for which they 
must pay, and especially when those things are largely purely do- 
mestic concerns, matters of conscience and questions of individual 
preference. Nor must it be expected that when charged with the 
onerous responsibility of molding the thought of a generation of 
_ citizens, a serious danger will go uncombatted by those who feel it 
' their duty to teach and not to tickle mankind. It is not our mis 
sioa to rear wards of the State, but to educate what, twenty years 
hence, will be the State itself. 
“7, Finally, we ‘ fear the Greeks even bearing gifts.’ We notice 
that the most of this text-book agitation originates, not with the 
people, but-directly or indirectly with the great publishing con- 
cerns themselves. Whenever in any State legislature of the Union 
have been introduced text-book bills looking to a uniform series 
mandatory for a term of years, we notice furious lobbying by the 
book trusts for the bill, but I haye yet to hear of such lobbying 
against it. The notorious scandals growing out of such operations
-P-A-G-E-268
—265— 
have brought reproach and contempt upon the law-makers of half 
a dozen States within as many years, and saddled upon the people 
burdens of sin and shame and wrong truly grievous to be borne. 
No State in the Union has been freer from such scandals than Ten- 
nessee, and the palpable inference is that the present law, clinging 
firmly to the traditions of the fathers, cannot be so very faulty at 
last, and that the local boards, in which is wholly vested the right 
of selecting and changing text-books as they see fit and expedient, 
are fairly well discharging their duty by their people and their 
State. Surely it is a most significant fact that the great book trusts 
are always so eager to divest local boards of this power, and so in- 
dustriously labor to secure the passage of laws rendering manda- 
tory a series of publications for use in State or county for « term of 
years. I believe such concerns know a good thing when they see 
it—and work accordingly. 
“Many other reasons, almost as potent as the foregoing, might 
be easily assigned, and doubtless it will occur to some of you that 
I have omitted many stronger than those I have stated. As a mat- 
ter of fact, it was wholly superfluous to state any at all, so far as 
this Association is concerned ; for the opinions of this whole body, 
regardless of politics or position, are too firmly established to be 
readily modified by any thing I could possibly say. I hope, how- 
ever, that before adjournment you will see fit to again formally re- 
iterate your views; and I trust that future State Superintendents 
and Governors will accord them that measure of honest deference 
which we recently experienced. 
“ Finally, in thanking you for your courteous patience in listen- 
ing to me, permit me to again regret that you could not have heard 
_ a fresher subject, or at least an abler man.” 
The applause that greeted Mr. Meadors at various intervals was 
evidence that the Association was unanimously of the same opinion 
as that expressed by the speaker. 
DEFINING DUTIES OF COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS. 
A resolution introduced by C. L. Hayes, of Lebanon, asking 
that the Legislature more clearly define the duties of County 
Superintendents, was referred to the Committee on Legislation. 
REPORT ON AMERICAN HISTORY. 
The Committee on American History, composed of F, K. Hen-
-P-A-G-E-269
—266— 
derson, C. L. Hayes, B. S. Beardshaw, Fred J. Page, and Geo. 
H. Armistead, reported commending the Legislature for creating 
and endowing the Chair of American History, and locating it at 
the Peabody Normal College; also endorsing the State Board of 
Education for electing Capt. W. R. Garrett to fill the chair. 
REPORT ON COUNTY ORGANIZATION. 
The report of the Committee on County Organization was adopted’ 
as follows: 
Your committee heartily endorse the suggestion of President 
Mynders, and undertake to put them into practice by recommend- 
ing that the teachers of each county in the State organize by elect- 
ing all officers necessary, and that each county association hold at 
least one meeting each year for the consideration of such questions. 
as tend to the improvement of our schools, and to provide for rep- 
resentation in this Association, by sending one or more representa- 
tives to each annual meeting. 
That the annual meetings of these county associations should be 
just preceding that of the State Teacher’s Association. 
We further suggest that the State Association prepare and send 
out its programme in time to have the same before the county 
associations at their annual meetings. J. H. ALLEN, 
: R. E. Goupsgy, 
J. C. Brooks, 
J. C. McCorp. 
WEDNESDAY Eventne’s SEssION. 
At the closing session of the Association the hall was crowded 
to overflowing long before 8 o’clock, the hour when President 
Mynders called the meeting to order. 
The proceedings were opened with a vocal solo by Miss Gamble. 
Prayer by Dr. McFerrin. 
ENDORSING THE GOVERNOR’S VETO OF THE TEXT-BOOK BILL. 
President Mynders, calling to the chair Prof. W. T. Watson, of 
Memphis, the First Vice President, introduced the following reso- 
lution and moved its adoption, which motion was seconded by Sec- 
retary Frank Goodman, whereupon the resolution was unanimously 
adopted as follows:
-P-A-G-E-270
—267— 
WHEREAS, we believe that the bill on the subject of text-books 
for public schools, passed by the last General Assembly, would have 
been detrimental to the interests of our schools, if it had been 
allowed to become a law ; therefore, be it 
Resolved, that the Tennessee State Teachers’ Association heartily 
endorses the action of Gov. Turney in vetoing the same. 
Resolved further, that no change should for the present be made 
in our law on the subject of adoption of text-books. 
Then followed a recitation by Miss Jarman. 
ELDER CAVE’S ADDRESS ON AMERICAN HISTORY. 
President Mynders next introduced Capt. CO. 8. Douglass, of Gal- 
latin, and he in turn introduced Rev. R. Lin Cave, of Nashville 
who delivered an eloquent and scholarly addresss on the subject of 
American History. The following are a few of the many valuable 
points brought out by the speaker : 
He began by speaking of history in general and gave some tena 
ing difficulties in writing history, showing that even the wisest and 
best writers of it are liable to be mistaken. But it has at least two 
great lessons. “First, it is a voice forever sounding across the 
centuries of right and wrong. Opinions alter, manners change, 
creeds rise and fall, but the moral law is written on the tables of 
eternity. For every false word or unrighteous deed, for cruelty 
and oppression, for lust or avarice, the price has to be paid at last. 
Justice and truth alone endure and live. Injustice and falsehood 
may be long-lived, but doomsday comes at last to them in French 
revolution and other terrible ways. Again history teaches us to 
draw no horoscopes; that we should expect little, for what we ex- 
pect will not come to pass. Those revolutions and reformations 
into which heroes and saints have flung themselves believing they 
were the dawn of the millennium have not borne the fruit which 
they looked for. Millenniums are still far away. Their sacrifices 
were not in vain, but the world is not improved, and the results 
are not as great and good as the actors hoped they would be. Our 
most encouraging and remarkable anticipations fail us.” In speak- 
ing of American history, attention was called to the greatness of 
the country, its vast resources and almost limitless possibilities, and 
also to our lack of proper historical effort in the United States, and 
especially in the South, which is capable of sustaining 88,000,000
-P-A-G-E-271
—268— 
increase of population without being crowded as much as Pennsy!l- 
vania. ‘It is a source of great pleasure to note the fact that we are 
realizing our situation and opportunity, and that Tennessee is lead- 
ing and has established a chair of American histcry in our Peabody 
Normal College. And it is especially gratifying that the Confeder- 
ate Veterans’ Association of Tennessee conceived and aided greatly 
in this good work. This alone is sufficient to justify the existence 
of this noble organization. This branch of study will embrace (1) 
class instruction, (2) the accumulation of historic material, (8) his- 
torical investigation, (4) historical publication. It cannot fail to 
stimulate increasing interest in American history generally, and 
directly in Southern history, so long and so much needed. Such 
historic training and teaching will give us useful knowledge of our 
entire country, and must prove a blessing to every section. 
“Tt seems to me too little attention has been given to the different 
sections of the country, in the relative and helpful part they have 
sustained to each other and the whole country. This has been 
difficult to avoid, from the fact that some sections have fewer and 
less able fair-minded and patriotic authors than others; hence less 
is known of their true history. It may require much labor and 
time to correct this hurtful condition. But it should be dore 
with all possible promptness. Every part of our country has much 
of real value in the way of history, and has contributed to our 
common greatness and glory. Let us collect it all, and fully and 
faithfully present and preserve it, and see if these dual blessings 
will not come—the arousing of a worthy local and sectional pride, 
and also a general generous patriotism, which will unify our efforts, 
lift us out of our politicz] selfishness, allay ignoble antegonisms, 
and bring us universal progress and prosperity. It would teach us, 
as sections, to bear one another’s burdens, and so fulfill the worthy 
law of national life. We would be thus taught, and learn to suffer 
together, the censure of failures and enjoy the praise of success, 
and would more willingly and gladly share our mutual triumphs 
and defeats. Let our history be full of impartiality, dealing justly 
with every section during every period. And we may feel sure 
when the history of the South is thus written we will have as little 
cause for shame as our brethren of any other section. He who 
writes it must know and tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing 
but the truth, so help him God. When such an one has arisen, and
-P-A-G-E-272
—269— 
fulfilled his calling, our defense will be accepted at the.bar of a 
noble-minded public. In the past almost every source of iaforma- 
tion as to our real condition and history shows the poisonous effects: 
of party spirit. Everywhere the historian was under the weakest 
possible prejudicial influences, as, for instance, in the simple recital 
of the life and manners of our people. We have been misunder- 
stood or misrepresented, and thus great injustice has been done. 
Almost nothing is known of our true history by the world at large. 
It is not too much to say that by the great outside world ‘ we are re- 
garded as an iguoraut, cruel, semi-barbarous section of America, sunk 
in brutality and vice, who have contributed much to the degradation, 
but nothing to the advancement, of mankind.’ Even in England, 
only a limited few are familiar with our real history and character. 
‘Let me quote an extract from the Encyclopedia Britanica, in its 
article on ‘American Literature,’ Vol. I., p. 719: 
“¢The attractive culture of the South has been limited in extent 
and degree. The hot-house fruit of wealth and leisure, it has 
never struck its roots deep into native soil. Since the revolution 
days, when Virginia was the nurse of statesmen, the few thinkers 
of America born south of Mason & Dixon’s line, outnumbered by 
those of the single State of Massachusetts, have commonly emi- 
grated to New York or Boston in search of a university training. 
In the world of letters, at least, the Southern States have shown by 
a reflected light. Nor is it too much to say, that mainly by their 
connection with the North the Carolinas have been saved from 
sinking to the level of Mexico or the Antilles.’ 
“Well may we exclaim, Think of this! this of the section tha 
has done so much to make our country, that has governed her so 
largely, administered her justice, commanded her armies and navies, 
doubled her territory, created a large share of her greatness, and 
furnished her presidents for fifty-two of the first sixty-four years of — 
her history! To no other section has such injustice been done. 
Let me appeal to you, teachers of Tennessee! One of England’s 
poets calls the press ‘the god of idolatry.’ May not this high 
compliment be paid to our teachers and our institutions of learn- 
ing? The moral and intellectual character of a nation is formed 
largely in our schools and universities. Those who educate a peo- 
ple are its real masters, though they be known by a more modest 
name. You mould the opinions of your pupils, give directions to
-P-A-G-E-273
—270— 
their actions, and thus guide the race in its onward march through 
the ages. Your position is one of great ‘honor and responsibility. 
You should move in the van of the army of knowledge and lead 
your followers, the host of youth of our land, up to that which is 
highest and best. To do this you must cast their minds in truth’s 
mould, that they may always advocate and enforces the right and 
expose and redress the wrong. Teach them the truth of history, 
and especially the truth of American history, and in so doing, while 
dealing justly and generously with every section, see to it that they 
are taught the truth in regard to their own, their native land, 
which has suffered already too long and too much at the hands of 
misrepresentation and falsehood. Our history, thus written and 
taught, should excite thankfulness in all religious minds, and hope 
in the breast of all patriots, and will tend to the general acceptance 
of the noble words and sentiments of Mr. Webster: “I was born 
an American; I will live an American; I shall die an American, 
and I intend to perform the duties incumbent upon me in that 
character to the end of my career.” 
Recitation by Miss Crockett. 
REPORT OF COMMITTEE ON RESOLUTIONS. 
The report of the Committee on Resolutions was as follows, and 
was unanimously adopted : 
To the President and Members of the Public School Officers’ Association: 
Your Committee on Resolutions respectfully report the following 
resolutions and move their adoption: 
1. Resolved, That this Association views with satisfaction the 
steady improvement of education in Tennessee. It is a gratifying 
fact, as attested by statistics and by personal observation, that the 
public schools of many of our cities and counties have already 
reached a high standard of excellence, while the public schools of 
other counties and cities are steadily and rapidly improving in 
organization and efficiency. We also view with pride and pleasure 
the improvement in our private schools, academies and seminaries, 
and we are especially gratified with the development of our college 
training schools, several of which have attained a degree of excel- 
lence and reputation which reflects honor upon them and upon the 
State.
-P-A-G-E-274
—271— 
2. Resolved, That we feel a just pride in our colleges and univer- 
sities, whose reputation has conferred upon Tennessee the name of 
“the University State.” 
3. Resolved, That we recommend to the colleges and universities 
and to the academies, training schools and pnblic high schools, that 
they confer together in a spirit of mutual concession, with a view to 
adapting their respective courses of instruction to meet each other’s 
wants, and to provide in a practical way for closing the chasm be- 
tween secondary and higher instruction io the benefit of the public 
-and to the advancement of education. Ha 
4. Resolved, That we indorse the administration of our retiring 
State Superintendent of Public Instruction, Hon. Frauk M. Smith; 
that we attribute to his efficient management much of the improve- 
ment of our public school system during recent years, and we con- 
gratulate him on his record of successful educational work during 
the past thirty years, which has been so clearly set forth in the re- 
ent pamphlet prepared by the Secretary of this Association. 
5. Resolved, That in the appointment of Hon. §. G. Gilbreath as 
State Superintendent of Public Instruction, we recognize that the 
Governor has made a wise selection, and has appointed a man well 
. qualified to guide the educational interests of the State. In this 
important work we tender him the cordial support of this Associ- 
ation. 
6. Resolved, That we extend our cordial thanks to the members of 
the local committees and to the citizens of Franklin for their zeal 
and courtesy in our entertainment both at the school building and 
at their homes; to the ladies for the music and recitations with 
which they have enlivened our meetings ; to ihe Louisville & Nash- 
ville and Nashville, Chattanooga & St. Louis railroads for reduced 
rates; to the management of the Tennessee Female College for the 
use of their grounds and chapel; to President Mynders, Secretary 
‘Goodman and the other officers of the Association for their able 
and efficient services; to the Nashville American and Nashville 
Banner for courtesies extended to this Association during the year, 
and especially to the Nashville American for the liberal space ten- 
dered to this Association for a full report of its proceedings. 
Wuerras, the National Edueational Association, at its recent 
meeting at Denver, Col., proposed certain changes in the constitu- 
tion governing that body, whereby the membership is to be divided
-P-A-G-E-275
—-272— 
into two classes of membership, namely, active and associate; the 
‘active membership to consist of teachers and all who are actively 
_associated with the management of educational institutions, includ- 
ing libraries and periodicals ; the associate members to be composed 
of all persons not included in the active membership who shall pay 
the annual membership fee of $2.00; and, 
WHEREAS, it was also voted that in the annual election of the 
directors there shall be one selected from each State and Territory ; 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Tennessee State Teachers’ Association heartily 
approve of the foregoing action of the National Educational Asso- 
ciation, and hereby renew its assurance of co-operation and friend- 
ship. 
Resolved, That this Association recommend Prof. Frank Good- 
man, of Nashville, to the President of the National Educational As- 
sociation for appointment as State Manager of the National Educa- 
tional Association for Tennessee. 
Respectfully submitted. W. R. Garrett, 
H. D. HurraKkeEr, 
G. R. McGre, 
Artuur C. MINTER, 
J. H. SIKEs. 
ELECTION OF OFFICERS. 
The report of the Executive Committee recommending the of- 
ficers for the censuing year was then received, and the recommenda- 
tions unanimously concurred in, as follows: 
President—G. R. McGee, Trenton. 
First Vice-president—W. T. Watson, Memphis. 
Second Vice-president—C. L. Hayes, Lebanon. 
Third Vice-president—John W. Paulett, Knoxville. 
Secretary and Treaswrer—Frank Goodman, Nashville. : 
Executive Committee—S. G. Gilbreath, Nashville; F. K. Hender- 
son, Humboldt; Jesse Tomlinson, Culleoka; J. H. Sikes, Good- 
Jettsville; A. T. Barrett, Chattanooga. 
PRESIDENT AND PRESIDENT-ELECT. 
President Mynders, in retiring as president, congratulated the 
Association on the success of the meeting, and returned thanks for
-P-A-G-E-276
| —273— 
the honor conferred and the co-operation given him during his en- 
tire administration. He also welcomed the President-elect, Prof. 
G. R. McGee, to the chair, and wished for him a successful admin- 
istration, and pledged his own efforts to the attainment of that end. 
President McGee, in assuming the chair, thanked the Associa- 
tion for the honor conferred, and solicited the assistance of each 
and every one during the coming year, so they might make the 
thirty-first annual session of the Association as great a success as _ 
had been the present meeting, and a session that would be worthy 
Tennessee’s centennial year. 
CLOSING. 
Mr. George H. Armistead delivered a farewell talk to the Asso- 
ciation, which, as an impromptu speech, was excellent. Asa speaker 
he has gifts much above the average. There is a natural ease of 
manner which attracts the audience, and the purity and poetry of 
his language makes it impossible to grow weary when George has 
the floor. It is quite certain that Franklin has one orator, if no 
more. 
The meeting would not be complete without the presence of 
Capt. C. 8. Douglass and Frank Goodman. These gentlemen are 
close friends, and have been associated together so long that 
they thoroughly understand each other. Professor Goodman, 
in his good-humored way, hits the Captain some hard licks, but, in 
the long run, finds Douglass a foeman worthy of his steel. The 
audience last night enjoyed the talks made by these gentlemen at 
the winding up of the meeting, and it was the opinion of all pres- 
ent that what was left out of the programme was equal to much 
that was printed. 
Professor Goodman attends strictly to all the details of the secre- 
taryship, but finds time to stir up the members and keep things 
_ lively. Douglass in particular is the target at which he shoots. 
The Association adjourned, to meet at such time and place as the 
Executive Committee may decide. 
Vocal solo, by Miss Baugh. 
President McGee appointed the following committees : 
Commitiee on School Laws—C. S. Douglass, Gallatin; W. R. 
Garrett, Nashville; S. A. Mynders, Jackson; James G. Meadors, 
McMinnville ; J. H. Allen, Shelbyville. J

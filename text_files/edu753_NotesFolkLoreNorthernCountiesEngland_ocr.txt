PREFACE. 
—+—. 
Tue AGE in which we live is remarkable, as in other 
points of view, so in this, that old habits and customs, 
old laws and sayings, old beliefs and superstitions, 
which have held their ground in the universal mind 
from the remotest antiquity, are fast fading away and 
perishing. We of the nineteenth century may con- 
gratulate ourselves on their disappearance; we may 
lament it, but the fact remains the same; and I for 
one will frankly acknowledge that I regret much which 
we are losing, that I would not have these vestiges of 
the past altogether effaced. It were pity that they 
should utterly pass away, and leave no trace behind. 
My heart as well as my imagination is too closely 
bound up with the sayings and doings which gave zest 
to the life of my forefathers, and so I became a Folk- 
Lore student before Folk Lore came into vogue as a 
pursuit. And, as befitted a genuine North-countryman, 
my researches were chiefly made in the district between 
the Tweed and the Humber. Accordingly, when, on 
the 14th of May, 1861, I was called upon as President 
of the Durham Athenzum to deliver a lecture in my 
native city, I chose for my subject the Folk Lore of,
-P-A-G-E-10
viii PREFACE. 
that part of England, and through the kindness of a 
few friends, residents in the North, if not natives of it, 
who zealously aided my researches, I was enabled to 
lay before the members of the Atheneum a consider- 
’ able collection of the stories, sayings, and superstitions 
of old Northumbria. 
It was plain that the mine was one of great riches, 
and it was to some extent unworked. Strangely 
enough, the mention of North Country Folk Lore in 
© Choice Notes, reprinted from Notes and Queries,’ is 
exceedingly scanty and meagre; and though Brand’s 
Popular Antiquities contains a fairer proportion of 
matter from this district, and there is a good deal that 
is interesting in Richardson’s Local Historian’s Table 
Book, much more clearly remained to be gathered up. 
But there was no time to lose. Old traditions were no 
longer firmly rooted in the popular mind, old customs 
were fast dying out, old sayings and household tales 
lingering only on the lips of grandsires and grandames ; 
they had ceased to be the spontaneous expression of 
the thoughts and feelings of the mass of our peasantry. 
And this, I believe, from two causes: first, the more 
generally diffused education of the people, and the 
fresh subjects of thought supplied to them in conse- 
quence; and again the migration of families which has 
taken place since the working of collieries and the 
extension of railways. Formerly, as our parish registers 
would show, families lived on for centuries in the same 
village or small town, sending out offshoots, far or 
near, as circumstances might lead. " Now whole families

uproot themselves, and move into other districts; and 
it has been found that when people are wrenched away 
from local associations, though they may carry their 
traditions with them, they fail to transmit them to 
their descendants. . . 
Be this however as it may, I continued my researches, 
noting down carefully every morsel of Folk Lore that 
came before me, and my reward has been far beyond 
my expectations. Besides many histories and sayings 
more or less noteworthy, I lighted on a treasure of ex- 
ceeding value, which, through the kindness of my friend 
the Rev. R. 0. Bromfield of Sprouston, I have been 
enabled to make my own. It was in fact a collection of 
Border customs, legends, and superstitions, put together, - 
about fifty years ago, by a young medical student of the 
name of Wilkie, residing at Bowden, near Eildon Hall; 
and this at the desire of Sir Walter Scott, for the pur- 
pose of being used by him in a projected work on 
the subject, which he never carried beyond two short 
essays on the Border Minstrelsy. Mr. Wilkie appears 
to have been a favourite and protégé of Sir Walter 
Scott, who procured him an appointment in India, 
where the young man died. ‘The collection, although 
of great interest, was, as I received it, by no means in 
a fit state for publication, The contents were not 
arranged, there was a good deal of repetition, and the 
style was diffuse and wordy. 
Meanwhile I had shown my lecture to the accom- 
plished Editor of the ‘Monthly Packet,’ whose interest 
in this and kindred subjects is well known, and whose
-P-A-G-E-12

varied and extensive reading renders her opinion 
peculiarly valuable. She expressed a wish that the 
lecture should be turned into an article for that maga- 
zine. This was done, and that article is the nucleus 
of this volume. To it I have annexed the numerous 
contributions which during upwards of five years I have 
received from a wide circle of friends, and with it I 
have incorporated the Wilkie MS., illustrating the 
whole, so far as I was able, by the Folk Lore of other 
parts of the country, and in a measure of all Europe. 
But for the kindness of many valuable friends who 
have noted down whatever bore upon the subject, and 
communicated to me the result of their observations, 
the collection could never have been formed; and I 
desire to express my hearty thanks to all who have thus 
aided me in my task, especially to the Rev. J. C. Atkin- 
son, Perpetual Curate of Danby; the Rev. J. Barnby, 
Principal of Hatfield Hall, University of Durham; the 
Rev. J. F. Bigge, Vicar of Stamfordham ; the Rev. R. 0.

To my friend the Rev. George Ornsby I am under

Gould for many notes of exceeding interest, for 
much of the Introductory Chapter, including all the 
references to the Fathers, &c., and for the Appendix on 
Household Stories. The Notes are dispersed through- 
out the work, and are distinguished by his initials. I 
must further add, that I have not pursued my labours 
singlehanded, although it is the wish of my fellow- 
worker, who desires only to be designated by the 
initials S. W., that this volume comes out under my 
name alone. I cannot, however, in justice do less than 
state here that her share in the work has been fully 
equal to my own. 
In comparing and classifying the subject-matter of 
this volume, I have chiefly used the following books: 
Brand’s Popular Antiquities,—Choice Notes from Notes 
and Queries: Folk Lore,—Kelly’s Indo-European Tra- 
ditions,—Thorpe’s Mythology and Popular Traditions 
of Scandinavia,—and Richardson’s Local Historian’s

INTRODUCTORY CHAPTER. 
—+— 
Ir 1s pirricunt, while living on the surface of society, 
so smooth, so rational, so commonplace, to realise what 
relics of a widely different. past linger in its depths— 
relics of an extensive and deeply-rooted system of 
mythology, antedating in great measure Christianity 
itself. Yet so it is: in almost every part of our island . 
we occasionally come across such bits of stubborn anti- 
quity, but in the North of England they abound. The 
district between the Tweed and the Humber teems with 
Folk Lore of a rich and varied character. Great part of 
the county of Durham is indeed spoiled (in an anti- 
quarian point of view) by collieries; but it still con- 
tains some quiet villages far away from great thorough- 
fares, where strange tales are yet told and strange old 
customs practised ; while the north and west of Nor- 
thumberland, and the North and East Ridings of York- 
shire, abound with them. 
Those who mix much among the lower orders, and 
have opportunities of enquiring closely into their beliefs, 
customs, and usages, will find in these remote places, 
—nay, even in our towns and larger villages,—a vast 
taass of superstition, holding its ground most tenaciously.

xvili INTRODUCTION. 
On looking closely into this, we discern, among much 
that is mythical and legendary in its character, and 
much that is the simple outgrowth of human fancy and 
imagination, a good deal of what is unquestionably 
heathenism in disguise. Archbishop Whately states 
this perhaps too broadly. ‘It is,’ he says, ‘a marvel to 
many, and seems to them nearly incredible, that the 
Israelites should have gone after other gods, and yet 
the vulgar in most parts of Christendom are actually 
serving the gods of their heathen ancestors. But then 
they do not call them gods, but fairies or bogles, and 
they do not apply the word worship to their veneration 
of them, nor sacrifice to their offerings. And this slight 
change of name keeps most people in ignorance of a 
fact that is before their eyes.’! : 
This is a strong statement, yet historical facts appear 
to bear it out. We know that as late as the seven- 
teenth century undisguised idol-worship was to be 
found in Brittany, while down to the eighteenth it was 
common there for offerings of money, milk, and ears 
of corn to be made to the Great Menhir, an obelisk 
once connected with Druidical worship. We know too, 
that almost if not quite up to the present time, on 
holiday eves, the Norwegian peasant has offered cakes, 
sweet porridge, and libations of wort or buttermilk, on 
mounds consecrated to the invisible folk, and called 
beettir mounds; and, as will be shown hereafter, well- 
nigh within the memory of man, beasts have been slain 
in sacrifice, at times of great extremity, in our own

country ; while the rites still in use for the dressing of 
wells at Buxton and Tissington in Derbyshire, and in 
other places throughout England and on the Borders, 
bear a singular resemblance to the Fontinalia of heathen 
Rome, when the nymphs of wells and fountains were 
honoured by flinging nosegays into the fountains and 
crowning the wells with garlands of flowers. 
The question naturally arises, how is it that heathen 
beliefs and heathen observances still exist in a country 
which was christianised so many centuries ago? We 
may reply, with reference to the district especially 
under our consideration, that the stern mould of the 
Northern mind is strong to retain images once deeply 
impressed upon it. And on the subject generally, it 
may be observed that from the beginning the Church 
appears practically to have tolerated such parts of the 
old mythological system as she considered harmless, 
and to have permitted them to live on without check or 
rebuke. Thus the customs: of the Lupercalia passed 
into those of St. Valentine’s Day, and the Scandinavian 
Yule coinciding with the Feast of the Nativity, the old 
Yule merrymakings and mummings continued in use 
without raising ecclesiastical censure. Thus the honour 
long given to persons and demigods was transferred to 
saints and martyrs. Thus, again, old sacred sites were 
taken possession of for the new faith. We often find 
Christian burial-grounds occupying the site of Pagan 
ones; and I myself have seen huge upright stones 
marking some place sacred in heathen eyes, in close 
. a2

Xx INTRODUCTION, 
proximity to Christian churches.’ In Sweden there was, 
at the first propagation of Christianity, a good deal of 
intermingling of truth and error. Heathen images were 
removed from the ancient oratories, and those of sacred 
beings set up in their places; still old associations proved 
sometimes too strong for the converts, and prayers to 
Thor and Freya were mixed with Christian orisons. 
In judging the clergy of the day for their line of 
action in this and kindred matters, we should in justice 
remember that they were taken from among the people, 
and consequently imbued with the same prejudices, 
feelings, and superstitions as those to whom they minis- 
tered. Nor must we forget that, like them, they were 
wholly unacquainted with the causes of natural pheno- 
mena, This universal ignorance of the laws of nature 
goes far to account for the widespread superstition 
which for ages pervaded all Europe, and which from 
local causes has taken so firm a grasp of some parti- 
cular spots. 
Perfectly unacquainted witb the laws that govern the 
universe, the early Christians, like the Pagans and Neo- 
Platonists, made supernatural beings the special cause 
of all the phenomena of nature. They attributed to 
these beings, according to their beneficial or injurious 
effects, all atmospheric phenomena. According to 
them, angels watched over the different elements, and 
demons endeavoured to overthrow their power. From 
} Thus, in Ireland, St. Patrick and his followers almost invariably 
selected the sacred sites of Paganism, and built their wooden churches 
under the shadow of the Round Towers—then as mysterious and in- 
serutable as they are to-day.

the struggle between them arose storms and whirlwinds, 
plagues and earthquakes. St. Clement of Alexandria 
refers all this to diabolic agency, and the same idea 
was perpetuated throughout the Middle Ages.' Hence 
it was that of old, storms were conjured to depart by 
the sign of the cross or the ringing of church-bells. 
From the first the Church, by the decrees of Councils 
and the voice of her chief Fathers and Doctors, con- 
demned such superstition as she deemed worthy of notice; 
not however on the ground of folly, but of impiety. It 
is possible, therefore, that her denunciations might go to- 
wards confirming a belief in the whole fabric of super- 
stition, as a real and powerful though forbidden thing. 
© Religion,’ said Lactantius, ‘ is the cultus of the truth, 
superstition is that of the false.’ ‘I omit other things 
that might make us weep,’ says St. Chrysostom.? ‘Your 
auguries, your omens, your superstitious observances, 
your casting of nativities, your signs, your amulets, 
your divinations, your incantations, your magical arts,— 
these are crying sins, enough to provoke the anger of God.’ 
© You may see a man washing himself from the pollution 
of a dead body; but from dead works, never. Again, 
spending much zeal in the pursuit of riches, and yet 
supposing the whole is undone by the crowing of a cock. 
So darkened are they in their understanding,—their soul 
is filled with all sorts of terrors. For instance: “Such a 
person,” one will say, “was the first to meet me as I was

going out of doors to-day,” and of course a thousand ills 
must ensue. At another time, “That wretch of a servant, 
in giving me my shoes, held out the left shoe first,” 
terrible mishaps and mischief! “I myself in coming 
out put my left leg foremost,” and here too is a token of 
_ Inisfortune. Then, as I go out, my right eye turns up 
from beneath—a sure sign of tears. Again, the women, 
when the reeds strike against the standards and ring, 
or when they themselves are scratched by the shuttle, 
turn this also into a sign. And again, when they strike 
the web with the shuttle, and do it with some vehemence, 
and then the reeds on the top sound, this again they 
make a sign; and ten thousand things beside as ridicu- 
lous. And so if an ass bray, or a cock crow, or a man 
sneeze, or whatever else happen, like men bound with 
ten thousand chains—they suspect everything, and are 
more enslaved than all the slaves in the world.’! 
A long list of popular superstitions was condemned 
by a Council held in the eighth century at Leptines, in 
Hainault, under the title of Indiculus superstitionwm 
et paganarium. Pope Gregory III. issued similar ana- 
themas.? The Capitularies of Charlemagne and his 
successors repeat the denunciation of them. 
About the same date similar superstitions were rebuked 
in Scotland by the Abbot Cumeanus the Wise, in his 
tract, De mensura penitentiarum. In the same century

St. Eligius, Bishop of Noyon, preached against similar 
superstitions: ‘ Above all, I implore you not to observe 
the sacrilegious customs of the pagans. Do not consult 
the gravers of talismans, nor diviners, nor sorcerers, nor 
enchanters, for any sickness whatsoever... Do not take 
notice of auguries, or of sneezings; do not pay atten- 
tion to the songs of the birds when you go abroad. Let 
no Christian pay regard to the particular day on which 
he leaves a house or enters it. Let no one perplex him- 
self about the New Moon or eclipses. Let no one do on 
the calends of January those forbidden, ridiculous, 
ancient, and disreputable things, such as dancing, or 
keeping open house all night, or getting drunk. Let 
no one on the feast of St. John, or any other saint, cele- 
brate solstices by dances, carols, or diabolical chants; 
Jet no one invoke Neptune, Pluto, Diana, Minerva, or 
his genius; let no one rest on the day of Jupiter, unless 
it fall on a saint’s day; nor observe the month of May, 
nor any other season or day, except the Lord’s day. 
Let no one light torches along the highways and cross- 
roads; let no one tie notes to the neck of a man or 
some animal; let no one make lustrations or enchant- 
ments upon herbs, or make his cattle pass through a 
split tree, or through a hole made in the ground. Let 
no one utter loud cries when the moon is pale; let no 
one fear that something will happen to him at New 
Moon; let no one believe in destiny or fortune, or the 
quadrature of the geniture, commonly called a nativity, 
&e. &e’ 
Four centuries later, Burchard of Worms made a

xxiv INTRODUCTION. 
collection of denunciations of superstition from the 
decrees of Councils and Popes, and the list is very 
remarkable. ‘Superstition is a vice opposed by excess 
to adoration and religion,’ said the illustrious Gerson ; 
and in the provincial Council of York, in a.v. 1466, it 
was declared, with St. Thomas, that all superstition was 
idolatry. . 
On the whole, it certainly appears that the early and 
medieval churches in their collective form, far from 
consciously encouraging heathenish superstition, con- 
stantly protested against it. Individual clergy in remote 
districts may have taken a different line, as St. Patrick 
is said to have ‘ engrafted Christianity on Paganism with 
so much skill, that he won over the people to the Chris- 
tian religion before they understood the exact: difference 
between the two systems of belief.! At any rate, the 
old superstition lived on with marvellous vitality, and the 
Reformation, at least on the Continent. and in Scotland, 
did little to check it. On the contrary, it would seem that 
when cut away from communion with the angelic world 
and saints departed, men’s minds fastened the more 
readily upon a supernatural system of another order. 
Curiously enough, Martin Tuther fell a prey to the 
grossest' superstition: witness the following extracts 
from his Table Talk, quoted in the Introduction to 
Thorpe’s Mythology, vol. ii. :— 
«Changelings (Wechselbdlge) and Kielkropfs, Satan 
lays in the place of the genuine children, that people

may be tormented with them. He often carries: off 
young maidens into the water, has intercourse with them, 
and keeps them with him until they have been de- 
livered; then lays such children in cradles, takes the 
genuine children out, and carries them away. But such, 
changelings, it is said, do not live more than eighteen 
or twenty years.’ Again: ‘ Eight years ago there was a 
changeling in Dessau, which I, Dr. Martin Luther, have 
both seen ‘and touched; it was twelve years old, and 
had all its senses, so that people thought it was a proper 
child; but that mattered little, for it only ate, and that 
as much as any four ploughmen or thrashers, and when 
any one touched it, it screamed ; when things in, the 
house went wrong, so that any damage took place, it 
laughed and was merry; but if things went well, it cried. 
Thereupon I said to the Prince of Anhalt, “If I were 
prince or ruler here, I would have this child thrown 
into the water, into the Moldau, that flows by Dessau, 
and would run the risk of being a homicide.” But the 
Elector of Saxony, who was then at Dessau, and the 
Prince of Anhalt, would not follow my advice. I then 
said they ought to cause a pater-noster to be said in the 
church, that God would take the devil away from them. 
This was done daily at Dessau, and the said changeling 
died two years after,’ , 
And on one point at least the early Scotch and Eng- 
lish Calvinistic divines evinced the greatest credulity. 
It is notorious that they believed unhesitatingly in the 
existence of sorcery, and were ever ready to extend and 
enforce the legal penalties against it. ‘It is not to be

denied,’ says Sir Walter Scott,! ‘ that the Presbyterian 
ecclesiastics, who in Scotland were often appointed by 
the Privy Council commissioners for the trial of witch- 
craft, evinced a very extraordinary degree of credulity in 
such cases, and that the temporary superiority of the 
same sect in England was marked by enormous cruelties 
of this kind.’ 
The notices, however, of the Folk Lore of my fellow- 
countrymen which I have been able to collect during 
the last six years, are widely varied in their origin. If 
some of them are unmistakable relics of heathenism, 
some have their origin in the rites and customs of the un- 
reformed Church, and some in the myths and historical 
traditions of our ancestors the Saxons and Danes ; while 
others, again, appear to be the spontaneous growth of 
sensitive and imaginative minds, yearning for commu- 
nion with a mysterious past and yet more mysterious 
future. They are varied too in their character ; some 
breathing deep religious feeling, some full of light grace~ 
ful fancy, while some are gross, vulgar, even cruel super- 
stitions. Let me add, that while recording them a 
conviction has deepened upon me that there are very, 
very many more incidents of a similar kind to be col- 
lected. Unless this be speedily done, I firmly believe 
that many a singular usage and tradition will pass away 
from the land unnoted and unremembered. It would 
be very desirable if a scheme could be organised for

eurately to note down every old custom, observance,

Turovenour the Borders, and in the six northern coun-

up with every stage of human life. To begin at the 
beginning—the nursery has there a folk lore of its own. 
And, first, the future character and fortunes of the infant 
may be divined from the day of the week on which it is 
born. For, as the old rhyme runs— 
Monday's child is fair of face, 
Tuesday’s child is full of grace, 
Wedunesday’s child is full of woe, 
And Thursday’s child has far to go.

Friday’s child is loving and giving, 
And Saturday’s child works hard for its living ; 
But the child that is born on the Sabbath-day, 
Is blithe and bonny, good and gay. 
It is remarkable that these verses, which are still cur- 
rent in Stockton and its neighbourhood, should be found 
also in the West of England. Mrs. Bray records them 
in her ‘ Traditions of Devonshire’ (vol. ii. p. 287), sub- 
stituting ‘Christmas Day’ for ‘the Sabbath Day,’ and 
‘fair and wise’ for ‘blithe and bonny,’ and says that 
they are in common use at Tavistock. ‘ Sunday chil- 
dren’ are in Yorkshire deemed secure from the malice 
of evil spirits. In Germany, too, they are held to be 
privileged beings, but I am not aware that their immu- 
nities are so clearly defined. 
‘Sunday children’ in Denmark have prerogatives by 
no. means to be coveted. Witness the following narra- 
tion from “Thorpe’s Mythology,’ vol.ii. p. 203: ‘In Fyen 
there was a woman who was born on a Sunday, and, 
like other Sunday’s children, had the faculty of seeing 
much that was hidden from others. But, because of 
‘this property, she could not pass by the church at night 
without seeing a hearse or a spectre, the gift became a 
perfect burden to her. She therefore sought the advice 
of a man skilled in such matters, who directed her, 
whenever she saw a spectre, to say, “Go to Heaven;” 
but when she met a hearse, “Hang on.” Happening 
some time after to meet a hearse, she, through lapse of 
“memory, cried out, “ Go to Heaven,” and straightway 
the hearse rose in the air, and vanished. Afterwards, 
meeting a spectre, she said to it, “ Hang on,” when the 
spectre clung round her neck, hung on her back, and 
drove her down into the earth before it. For three 
days her shrieks were heard before the spectre would 
put an end to her wretched life.’
-P-A-G-E-33
HOUR OF BIRTH. 3 
The hour of birth is also important, for children. born 
during the hour after midnight have the power through 
life of seeing the spirits of the departed. Mrs, L—-, 
a Yorkshire lady, informs me that she was very near 
being thus distinguished, but.the clock had not struck 
12 when she was born. When a child, she men- 
tioned this circumstance to an old servant, adding that 
mamma was sure her birthday was the 23rd, not the 
24th, for she had enquired at. the time. ‘Ay, ay,’ 
said the old woman, turning to the child’s nurse, ‘ mis- 
tress would be very anxious about that, for bairns born 
after midnight see more things than other folk,’ 
The Wilkie MS. tells us that throughout the Border- 
land, the birth of an infant.is the signal for plenty of 
eating and drinking. Tea, duly qualified with brandy 
or whisky, and a profusion of shortbread and buns, 
are provided for all visitors, and it is very unlucky to 
allow anyone to leave the house without his share of 
these good things. But most important of all is the 
*shooten’ or groaning cheese, from which the happy 
father must cut a ‘ whang-o’luck’ for the lassies of the 
company, taking care not to cut his own finger while so 
doing, since in that case the child would die before 
reaching manhood. The whang must be taken from 
the edge of the cheese, and divided into portions, one 
for each maiden. Should there be any to spare, they 
may be distributed among the spinster friends of the 
family, but if the number should fall short, the mistake 
cannot be rectified; there is ho virtue in a second slice. 
The girls put these bits of cheese under their pillows, and 
ascribe to. them the virtues of bridecake similarly treated. 
Now it is plain that cake and a new cheese were for- 
merly provided against the birth of a child both in 
England and Scotland, and the custom still extends as 
. pa :

far south as the Humber. In the North of England, as 
soon as the happy event is over, the doctor cuts both 
cake and cheese, and all present partake of both, on pain 
‘of the poor baby growing up without personal charms. 
‘The cake which is in use on these occasions in York- 
shire is called pepper-cake, and somewhat resembles 
_ thick gingerbread. It is eaten with cheese and rich 
caudle, and all visitors to the house up to the baptism 
are invited to partake of it! In Sweden, the cake and 
cheese are got ready in good time; they are placed be- 
side the bride in the bridal bed, in preparation for her 
first confinement.? In Oxfordshire, the cake used to 
be cut first in the middle and gradually shaped to a 
ring, through which the child was passed on its christ- 
ening-day. The Durham nurse reserves some cake 
and cheese, and when the infant is taken out to its 
christening, she bestows them on the first person whom 
she'meets of opposite sex to that of the child. A 
similar custom has I know but just died out in the 
Devonshire villages round Dartmoor, and in * Choice 
Notes, Folk Lore,’ we read of such a gift of bread and 
cheese in Somersetshire, and of a cake in Cornwall. 
(Page 147). 
It is thought unlucky on the Borders to tread on the 
graves of unbaptised children, or ‘unchristened ground,’ 
as they term it, The Wilkie MS. informs us of the 
special risk that is run. He who steps on the grave of 
a stillborn or unbaptised child, or of one who has been 
overlaid by its nurse, subjects himself to the fatal 
disease of the grave-merels, or grave-scab. This com- 
plaint comes on with trembling of the limbs and hard. 
breathing, and at last the skin burns as if touched with

hot iron. ‘The following old verses elucidate this 
superstition :— 
Love to the babie that ne’er saw the sun, 
All alane and lane, oh! 
His bodie shall lie in the kirk ‘neath the rain, 
All alane and alane, oh! 
His grave must be dug at the foot 0’ the wall, 
All alane and alane, oh ! 
And the foot that treadeth his body upon, 
Shall have scab that will eat to the bane, oh! 
And it ne’er will be cured by doctor on earth, 
Tho’ every one should tent him, oh! 
Fle shall tremble and die like the elf-shot eye, 
And return from whence he came, oh! 
Powerless, however, as the faculty may be, there is a , 
remedy for the grave-merels, though not of easy attain- 
ment. It lies in the wearing a sack, thus prepared. 
The lint must be grown in a field which shall be 
manured from a farmyard keep that has not been 
disturbed for forty years. It must be spun by old 
Habbitrot, that queen of spinsters, of whom more here~ 
after; it must be bleached by an honest bleacher, in 
an honest miller’s milldam, and sewed by an honest 
tailor. On donning this mysterious vestment, the suf- 
ferer will at once regain his health and strength.’ 
It is curious to observe what a different feeling, with 
regard to stillborn children, may be met with in the 
South. We read in ‘Choice Notes’ (p. 172) that one of 
the Commissioners of Devonport, after complaining of 
the charge made upon the parish for the interment of 
1 In Sweden, if a person afflicted with an open sore walks over any 
graves, it will heal slowly or never. (Thorpe’s Mythology, vol. ii. p. 110.) 
‘An old belief in Yorkshire enjoins that 2 new-born child be laid in the: 
arms of a maiden before anyone else holds him.
-P-A-G-E-36
6 LIVE AND DEATH OF MAN. . 
such children, said: ‘When I was a young man, it was 
thought lucky to have a stillborn child put into any 
open grave, as it was considered a sure passport to 
heaven for the next person buried there.’ 
In the southern counties of Scotland, children are 
. considered before baptism at the mercy of the fairies, 
who may carry them off at pleasure, or inflict injury 
upon them. Brand mentions this danger,’ and says 
the Danish women guard their children during this 
period against evil spirits by placing in the cradle, or 
over the door, garlic, salt, bread, and steel in the form 
of some sharp instrument. ‘ Something like this,’ he 
adds, ‘ obtained in England. In Germany, the proper 
things to lay in the cradle are “ orant” (which is trans- 
lated into either horehound or snapdragon), blue mar- 
joram, black cumin, a right sbirt-sleeve, and a left 
stocking. The “ Nickert ” cannot then harm the child, 
The modern Greeks dread witchcraft at this period of 
their children’s lives, and are careful not to leave them 
alone during their first eight days, within which period 
the Greek Church refuses to baptise them.? 
In Scotland the little one’s safeguard is held to lie in 
the juxtaposition of some article of dress belonging to 
its father. This was experienced by the wife of a 
shepherd near Selkirk. Soon after the birth of her 
first child, a fine boy, she was lying in bed with her 
baby by her side, when suddenly she became aware of a 
confused noise of talking and merry laughter in the 
‘spence,’ or room. This, in fact, proceeded from the 
_ fairies, who were forming a child of wax as a substitute 
for the baby, which they were planning to steal away. 
The poor mother suspected as much, so in great alarm 
she seized her husband’s waistcoat, which chanced to be

-P-A-G-E-37
PHYSICAL POWER OF BAPTISM. . 7 
lying at the foot of the bed, and flung it over herself 
and the child. The fairies set up a loud scream, calling 
out ‘ Auld lucky has cheated us 0’ our bairnie'’? Soon 
afterwards the woman heard something fall down the 
lum (or chimney), anid looking out she saw a waxen 
image of her baby, stuck full of pins, lying on the 
hearth. When her husband came home he made up a 
large fire and threw the fairy lump upon it; butinstead 
of burning, the thing flew up the chimney, and the 
house instantly resounded with shouts of joy and peals 
of laughter. Family affection must have been very 
strong when any trifle closely connected with the father 
was deemed a safeguard for the child,' a safeguard 
needed till its baptism shielded it from every evil or 
malicious sprite. 
Our northern folk lore is unanimous in bearing witness 
to the power of baptism. A clerical friend of mine, 
who once held a cure in Northumberland, tells me that 
it is there considered to affect a child physically, as 
well as spiritually—a notion which I think prevails more 
or less through the whole country. I have heard old 
people in many places say of sickly infants, ‘Ah, 
there will be a change when he has been taken to 
church! Children never thrive till they have been 
christened.’ One of my clerical friends tells me that 
about five years ago an instance came under his notice 
of the healing power supposed to be wrought by bap- 
tism as regards the body. The infant child of a chimney- 
sweeper at Thorne, in the West Riding of Yorkshire, 
was in a very weak state of health, and appeared to be 
pining away. A neighbour looked in, and enquired if 
1 ¢A part of tho father’s clothes should be laid over a female child, 
and the mother’s petticoat on a male child, to find favour with the 
opposite sex.’—Thorpe’s Mythology, vol. ii. p. 109.
-P-A-G-E-38
8 LIFE AND DEATH OF MAN. 
the child had been baptised. On an answer being 
given in the negative, she gravely said, ‘I would try 
having it christened.’ The counsel was taken, and I 
believe with success. It is the custom in Northumber- 
land to make the chrisom child sleep the first night in 
the cap he wore at baptism. ‘Loud murmurs, says my 
friend, ‘arose against me, early in my ministerial life, 
for applying so much water that the cap had to be 
taken off and dried, whereas it should be left on till 
the next morning. I threw the blame on the modern 
caps with their expanse of frilling, on which the good 
woman said that I was quite right; she had an old 
christening cap, the heirloom of a friend, which she 
could show me, of a very different make. Accordingly 
T examined the cap, which was evidently very old, and 
made with reference to affusion in baptism. It excluded 
forehead, ears, and chin, and apparently never had strings. 
I said that if a mother would bring her baby in such a 
cap, I would undertake not to wet it.’ 
In the North as in the South of England, nurses think 
it Iucky for the child to ery at its baptism; they say that 
otherwise the baby shows that it is too good to live. 
Some, however, declare that this cry betokens the pangs 
of the new birth; some that it is the voice of the evil 
spirit, as he is driven out by the baptismal water. As to 
the mother’s churching, it is very ‘uncannie’ for her to 
enter any other house before she goes to church, and 
she carries ill-luck with her. It is believed also that if 
she appears out-of-doors under these circumstances, 
and receives any insult or blows from her neighbours, 
she has no remedy at law. I am informed that old 
custom enjoins Irish women to stay at home till after 
their churching, as rigidly as their Scotch or English 
sisters. They have, however, their own way of evading
-P-A-G-E-39
FOLK LORE CONNECTED WITH BAPTISM. 9 
it. They will pull a little thatch from their roof, or 
take a splinter of slate or tile off it, fasten this at the 
top of their bonnet, and go where they please, stoutly 
averring afterwards to the priest, or anyone else, that 
they have not gone from under their own roof. 
A pleasant little custom is mentioned in the Wilkie 
MS.; the first child baptised by a minister, after his ap- 
pointment to a parish, is to receive his Christian name. 
Through the North of England, if a boy and girl are 
brought together to the font, care must be taken that 
the former be christened first ; else he is condemned to 
bear through life a smooth. and beardless face, ‘and, still 
worse, the young lady will surely be endowed with the 
ornament he lacks. This belief holds its ground in Dur- 
ham, and extends as far north as the Orkney Islands. 
One curious nursery practice exists both in the North 
and in the extreme West of England, that-of leaving an 
infant’s right hand unwashed ; and the reason alleged is 
the same—that he may gather riches. The baby’s nails 
must not be cut till he isa year old, for fear he should 
grow up a thief, or, as they quaintly express it in Cleve- 
land,-‘ light-fingered.” The mother must bite them off, 
if need be; and in the west of Northumberland it is 
believed that if the first parings are buried under an 
ash-tree, the child will turn out ‘a top singer.” The 
mention of the ash is curious, for has it not been from 
very ancient times a sacred tree, supplying in its sap the 
first nourishment to the Grecian hero, as now to the 
Celtic Highlander? Nay, according to Hesiod, Zeus 
made the third or brazen race of hard ashwood—pug- 
nacious and terrible;} as Yggdrasil, the cloud-tree of the 
Norseman, out, of which he believed the first man was 
made, was an ash. 
1 Grote’s History of Greece, vol. i. chap. 2.
-P-A-G-E-40
10 LIFE AND DEATH OF MAN. 
‘When the year of infancy is past, and baby’s nails 
may safely be given up to the scissors, care must be taken 
not to cut them on a Sunday or Friday. Friday, of 
course, is an unlucky day, and as for Sunday the old 
rhyme says— 
Better a child had ne’er been born 
Than cut his nails on a Sunday morn! 
Another variation of the verse runs thus—- 
Friday hair, Sunday hom, 
Better that child had ne'er been bo t 
And yet another— 
Sunday shaven, Sunday shorn, 
Better hadst thou ne'er been born’? 
Or, at greater length— 
Cut them on Monday, cut them for health, 
Cut them on Tuesday, cut them for wealth ; 
Cut them on Wednesday, cut them for news, 
Cut them on Thursday, a pair of new shoes ; 
Cut them on Friday, cut them for sorrow, 
Cut them on Saturday, a present to-morrow; 
But he that on Sunday cuts his horn, 
Better that he had never been born! 
Again, the Cleveland nurses say that it is very impor- 
tant for an infant to go up in the world before it goes 
down. " Thus, if a child should be born in the top story 
of a house, for want of a flight of stairs, one of the 
gossips will take it in her arms, and mount a table, 
chair, or chest of drawers, before she carries it down- 
stairs. I have heard of a similar belief in the Channel 
Islands. 
The Wilkie MS. contains a caution against rocking a 
cradle when it is ‘toom,’ or empty, and cites on the sub- 
ject the following fragment :—
-P-A-G-E-41
THE TOOM CRADLE. Ut 
Tux Toom CRADLE. 
Oh! rock not the cradle when the babi ’s not in, 
For this by old women is counted a sin; 
It’s a crime so inhuman it may na’ be forgi’en, 
And they that wi’? doit ha’e lost sight of heaven, 
Such rocking maun bring on the babie disease, 
‘Well may it grow fretty that none can it please, 
Its crimson lip pale grows, its clear eye wax dim, 
Its beauty grow pale, and its visage wax grim. 
Its heart flutters fast, it breathes hard, then is gone, 
To the fair land of heaven * * * * 
The belief thus expressed holds its ground in the 
southern counties of Scotland, particularly in Selkirk- 
shire. It crops out too in Holland, where rocking an 
empty cradle is affirmed to be injurious to the infant, 
and a prognostic of its death;! and in Sweden, where 
they say that it makes the child noisy and given to 
crying? Rocking the toom cradle is often deprecated 
in the counties of Durham and Yorkshire on another 
ground; it is said there to be ominous of another 
claimant for that place of rest. The proverb ‘soon 
teeth, soon toes,’ shows another portent of such an 
event. If baby’s teeth come early there will soon be 
fresh toes, i.e. another baby. This belief extends to 
Sweden. 
Perhaps I may mention here a kindly Northern cus- 
tom, that in all sales, either under distraint for rent 
or common debt, the cradle should be left unsold, and 
remain the property of its original owner. Are you

3 In the year 1848, the family house of the Nevilles, in the city of 
Durham, cailed the Bull’s Head, from their cognizance probably, was 
pulled down to make@ray for the present Town Hall.’ In a garret of 
the mansion was discovered a highly ornamented cradle, in which. 
doubtless, the great Barons of the North had been rocked in infancy. 
Unfortunately, it was destroyed by the workmen on the spot. There

curious to know the sex of the coming stranger? You 
must notice whether the old baby says papa or mamma 
first; in the former case it will be a boy, in the latter 
agirl. Ifachild tooths first in its upper jaw, it is 
considered ominous of death in infancy. 
Much importance attaches to the baby’ 3 first visit to 
another house, on which occasion it is expected that he 
should receive three things—an egg, salt, and white 
bread or cake; the egg a sacred emblem from the re- 
motest antiquity, and the cake and salt things used 
alike in Jewish and in pagan sacrifices. Somewhat 
grotesquely they add, in the Kast Riding of Yorkshire, 
‘a fourth thing, a few matches to light the child on the 
way to heaven. - These votive offerings must be pinned 
in the baby’s clothes, and so brought home. I have 
heard an old woman in Durham speak of this as the 
child receiving alms. ‘He could not claim them before 
he was baptised,’ she said; ‘ but now he is a christian 
he has a right to go and ask alms of his fellow-chris- 
tians.”" Near Leeds this ceremony is called ‘ puddening.’ 
Scotch nurses note with which hand a child takes 
up a spoon to sup. If it be the left you may be sure 
that he will be an unlucky fellow all his life. So says 
the author of the Wilkie MS. He adds, that the 
women who live on the banks of the Ale and Teviot 
have a singular custom of wearing round their necks 
blue woollen threads or small cords, till they wean their 
children. They do this for the purpose of averting 
is something touching in the thought, that the last relic in this city of 
a family so famed for deeds and for sufferings should be of so domestic 
a character. Probably the stvong feeling alluded to in the text caused 
the cradle to be hidden when all the other farpiture of this ancient 
house was dispersed.“ 
> Compare this with the Swedish saying, ‘You must not take an 
unbaptised child into anyone’s house ; it would bring misfortune there’
-P-A-G-E-43
NURSERY FOLK LORE. 13 
ephemeral fevers, or, as they call them, ‘weeds and 
onfas.’ These threads are handed down from mother 
to daughter, and esteemed in proportion to their an- 
tiquity. ‘I possess,’ he says, ‘one of these myself, 
which was given me by a woman in the farm of Caverse, 
near Melrose, and I remarked that all the nursing 
mothers in that district wore a similar thread.’ 
I do not know whether Superstition ever interferes 
with the grown-up maiden’s peeps in the looking-glass. 
Perhaps it would be as well if she did, but in Durham 
she strictly forbids boy or girl to look in one while 
under a year old. Swedish maidens dare not look in the 
glass after dark, or by candlelight, lest they forfeit the 
goodwill of the other sex.' | Several pieces of Swedish 
nursery folk lore are recorded in this place: e.g., a book 
must be placed under the head of a new-born child, that 
he may be quick at reading ; so Jong as an infant is un- 
named the fire must not be extinguished ; nor must any- 
one pass between the fire and a sucking babe; nor, 
again, must anyone entering the house take a child in 
his hands, without. previously having touched fire. 
Also a child must not be allowed to creep through a 
window, nor may anyone step over a child, or walk 
round a child that is sitting on the floor, or is in a 
carriage; for then it is believed that the little one will 
never grow bigger than it is. 
The Wilkie MS. tells us that children born with a 
hallihoo (holy or fortunate hood) or caul around their 
heads are deemed lucky, but the caul must be preserved 
carefully; for should it be lost or thrown away, the 
child will pine away, or even die. This superstition 
however is world-wide, and of such antiquity as to be 
teproved by St. Chrysostom, in several of his homilies.

means to be prosperous and fortunate in everything. 
In our own country, seamen used to purchase cauls to 
save them from drowning ;. advocates, that they might 
thereby be endued with eloquence. Twenty guineas 
were asked for one in 1779, twelve pounds in 1813, 
six guineas in 1848, In this.last case the caul was of 
some antiquity, and fifteen pounds had originally been 
given for it by a seaman, who had carried it about with 
him for thirty years.! Brand also quotes from Willis’s 
‘Mount Tabor’ (4.p. 1639), an account concerning ‘an 
extraordinary veile that covered my body at my coming 
into the world,’ which veil the autbor considered a sign 
of exceeding good fortune, ‘there being,’ he proudly 
adds, ‘ not one child amongst many hundreds that are 
so. born.’ 
One other instance has however come to my own 
knowledge, and here, too, the happy mortal prided her- 
self not a little on the distinction accorded to. her. 
Within the last five years, in one of our northern 
cities, a servant was found by her mistress in a state of 
dejection, for which at first there seemed no assignable 
cause. After much questioning the lady elicited that 
her servant had been born with a veil over her head, 
which was now presaging evil to her. The veil, she 
said, had been carefully preserved by her mother, who 
had entrusted it to her on coming to woman’s estate. 
It had been stretched and dried, and so had remained 
for many years. The girl kept it locked in her chest 
of drawers, and regularly consulted. it as her oracle and 
adviser. If danger threatened her, the veil shrivelled 
up; if sickness, the veil became damp. When good

fortune was at hand, the veil laid itself smoothly out; 
and if people at a distance were telling lies about her, 
the veil would rustle in its paper. Again, the veil did 
not like her to cut her hair, If she did so it changed 
colour and became uneasy. The owner firmly believed 
that when she died the veil would disappear. She re- 
garded it with mysterious awe, and only allowed her 
most intimate friends to know of its existence. 
Childhood has its own, folk lore all England over—its 
traditional beliefs and practices, couched most com- 
monly in verses which attune the infant ear, and charm 
the infant imagination. The young northern is pecu- 
liarly favoured. in these respects. Does he want to 
make a butterfly alight, he bas only to repeat the 
following lines— 
. Le, la, let, 
Ma bonnie pet ; 
and if only he say them often. enough, the charm never 
fails. Does rain threaten to spoil a holiday, let him 
chant out :— 
Rain, rain, go away, 
Come another summer's day + 
Rain, rain, pour down, . 
And come. no more to our town 3. 
or, more quaintly yet-— 
Rain, rain, go to Spain ; 
Fair weather come again : 
and, sooner or later, the rain will depart. If there be 
a rainbow the juvenile devotee must look at it all the 
time, 
These rhymes are in use,I believe, in every nur- 
sery in England; but the following verse, though said 
to be popular in, Berwickshire, is unknown elsewhere :—
-P-A-G-E-46
16 LIFE AND DEATH OF MAN. 
Rainbow, rainbow, haud awa’ hame, 
A’ yer bairns are dead but ane, 
And it lies sick at yon grey stane, 
And will be dead ere you win hame. 
Gang owre the Drumew and yon’t the lea, 
And down by the side o’ yonder sea ; 
‘Your bairn lies greetin like to dee, 
And the big teardrop is in his o’e. 
The Drumaw is a high hill skirting the sea in the east 
of Berwickshire. - It was a bold flight of fancy to per- 
sonify the rainbow, and endow him with a family of 
bairns; and the contrast is curious between the young 
Celt searching by the grey stone for the rainbow’s bairn, 
with ‘ the tear-drop in his ee, and the Saxon boy run- 
ning to catch the rainbow for the sake of the pot of 
gold at its foot. 
The late Mr. Denham, a very careful collector of old 
sayings and old usages, says that he well remembers 
how he and his scbool-companions used, on the appear- 
ance of a rainbow, to place a couple of straws or twigs 
across on the ground, and, as they said, cross out the 
rainbow. The West Riding recipe for driving away a 
rainbow is, ‘Make a cross of two sticks and lay four 
pebbles on it, one at each end.’ 
The crow-charm is perhaps universal in our island:— 
Crow, crow, get out of my sight 
Or else I’ eat your liver and light ; 
as well as the snail-charm— 
Snail, snail, put out your horn, 
Or V'U kill your father and mother the morn; 
though the latter more commonly runs in the South—- 
Snail, snail, come out of your hole, 
Or else I’ll beat you as black as a coal.
-P-A-G-E-47
‘NAL, RHYMES. vz 
In Devonshire they have it-—— 
Snail, snail, shoot out your horn 
Father and mother are dead, 
Brother and sister are in the back-yard, 
Begging for barley bread ; 
and in the South of Italy 
Snail, snail, pat out your horn, 
Your mother is laughing you to scorn 
For she has a little son just born. 
The ladybird is roused to activity by the ery of— 
Ladybird, ladybird, fly away home, 
Thy house is on fire, thy children all gone! 
And during the nursery application of dock-leaves for 
a nettle-sting, one of the following rhymes is sung :— 
Nettle out, dock in, 
Dock remove the nettle-sting ; 
Or, 
* In dock, out nettle, 
Don’t let the blood settle. 
Or, again, 
Nettle in, dock out, 
Dock in, nettle out, 
Nettle in, dock out, 
Dock rub nettle out; 
Or, lastly, 
Docken in and nettle out, 
Like an awde wife's dish-clout. 
Schools, too, have their superstitions and their 
legendary rites. In my own day, and perhaps at the 
present time, no boy would commit himself to the Wear 
without the precaution of an eel-skin tied round his left 
leg to save him from cramp. Well do.I remember thus 
fortifying myself against danger, before plunging into 
the stream. Another of our little superstitions was, 
“9
-P-A-G-E-48
18 LIFE AND DEATH OF MAN. 
that a horsehair kept in water would in due time turn 
into an eel; and many a time have we tried the experi- 
ment, ever attributing its failure to some adventitious 
circumstance, not to a fallacy in our belief. I am told 
that this mistake may be traced to the sudden appear- 
ance, after rain, of long hairlike worms in the deep 
holes left in clayey ground by horses’ hoofs. There was 
no trace of such creatures before the holes were filled 
with rain-water ; and, wondering how they could have 
arrived there, boys imagined them to be hairs, dropped 
from the horses’ mane and tail, in course of transition 
into eels. 
We had at our school an institution called ‘cobbing,’ 
which tells of rougher times than ours. A friend and 
schoolfellow of mine thus describes it :— 
€When a cobbing match was called, all the boys 
rushed forward, and seized the unfortunate object of the 
match by the hair, repeating these lines se 
All manner of men, under threescore and ten, 
Who don’t come to this cobbing match, 
Shall be cobbed over and over again; 
By the high, by the low, by the wings of the crow, 
Salt-fish, regnum, buck, or a doe. 
I spare you the details of the tortures named salt-fish 
and regnum: buck was.a rap on the skull with the 
closed hand—doe a tug at the hair, dragging out many 
a lock. Those who bore no part in cobbing the victim 
were liable to be cobbed themselves—so were those who 
were so unlucky as not to be able to touch the hair of the 
victim, or who, while repeating the verses, neglected the 
prescribed rites—#.¢., the standing on one leg, closing one 
eye, elevating the left thumb, and concealing the teeth.’ 
I remember well that we schoolboys used to spit our 
faith, when required to make asseveration on any matters
-P-A-G-E-49
SCHOOLBOY SUPERSTITIONS. 19 
we deemed important; and many a time have I given or 
received a challenge according to the following formula: 
‘IT say, Bill, will you fight Jack ?’—* Yes” ‘¢ Jack, will 
you fight Bill?’—* Yes. < Best cock, spit over my little 
finger” Jack and Bill both do so; and a pledge thus 
sealed is considered so sacred that no schoolboy would 
dare hang back from its fulfilment. Thus, fishwomen 
and hucksters generally spit upon the handsel,i.e.the first 
money they receive. One schoolboy belief we actually 
attempted to verify, with a daring worthy of a better 
cause. It was a bold venture, and we laid our plans well 
and secretly, so that none but the actors knew anything 
about it. Providing -ourselves with a black cat, from 
whose fur every white hair had been carefully abstracted, 
we assembled on 4 dark winter night in the cathedral 
churchyard, and grouped ourselves within a circle, 
marked on the grass. We were bent on raising the evil 
spirit, and meant instantly to present him with poor 
pussy as an offering. The senior of the party read the 
Lord’s Prayer backwards, and repeated some cabalistic 
verses; but the adjuration was not responded to, which 
perhaps was something of a relief to the actors. It may ' 
be that this divination has prevailed among boys; is it 
hence that they are sometimes called young dare- 
devils ? 
In the folk lore of Presbyterian Scotland we find, of 
course, no mention of Confirmation. Throughout Eng- 
land, a preference is, I believe, universally felt for the 
touch of the bishop’s right hand over the left. Thus, 
not long ago, in Exeter, a poor woman presented herself, 
as a candidate for that rite, to oe of the clergy of that 
city, who remembered her having been confirmed three 
years before. On his taxing her with this she could not 
deny it ; but pleaded that she had had the bishop’s left 
c2

20 LIFE AND DEATH OF MAN, 
hand then, and had been so uneasy ever since, that she 
did want to try her luck again! In the North of England, 
however, this evil is more defined ; the unfortunate re- 
cipients of the left hand are doomed on the spot to a 
life of single blessedness. A friend tells me of an old 
Yorkshire woman, who came for confirmation a second, 
if not a third time, from a different motive. She had 
heard, she said, ‘it was good for the rheumatiz!’ 
To pass on to marriage, the nucleus for a vast store of 
folk lore. The following rhymes show the importance 
of choosing an auspicious day for the ceremony; they 
express the popular belief of the county of Durham:— 
Monday for wealth, : 
Tuesday for health, 
“Wednesday the best day of all: 
Thursday for losses, 
Friday for crosses, 
And Saturday no luck at all. 
This attribute of Thursday is curiously opposite to that 
which distinguishes it in Scandinavia, where, as Thor’s- 
day, itis regarded as an auspicious day for marrying. The 
English tradition coincides however with the German, 
where it is held unlucky to marry on Thursday, probably 
because Thor is partly identified there with the devil. 
The unsuitableness of Lent for marrying and giving 
in marriage is bitterly expressed in the verse, 
If you marry in Lent 
You will live to repent. 
But f fear that, in point of fact, the month of May is 
more avoided in Scotland than the season of Lent. The 
prejudice against marrying in May, which Lockhart calls 
a classical as well as a Scottish one, was respected in his 
own marriage, Sir Walter Scott hurrying away from

WEDDING PORTENTS. "ay 
London that his daughter Sophia’s wedding might take 
place before that inauspicious month commenced. 
The portents for good or evil which surround Border 
marriages are, as given in the Wilkie MS., numerous 
indeed. It is unlucky for swine to cross the path in 
front of a wedding-party. Hence the old adage, ‘ The 
swine’s run through it. The presence of the bride’s 
mother is inauspicious too. A wedding after sunset 
entails on the bride a joyless life, the loss of children, or 
an early grave. An allusion to this may be found in 
several Scottish songs. Thus there is one which begins, 
«The bridegroom grat as the sun went down.’ A wet 
day is deemed unlucky too, while a fine one is aus« 
picious. Here, in fact, as all Christendom over, 
Blest is the bride that the sun shines on! 
Green, ever an ominous colour in the Lowlands of: 
Scotland, must on no account be worn there at & 
wedding. The fairies, whose chosen colour it is, would 
resent the insult, and destroy the wearer. In fact, 
nothing green must make its appearance that day ; kale 
and all other green vegetables are excluded from the 
wedding-dinner. With this exception, any good things 
in season may grace the board, and a pair of fowls must 
on no account be omitted. It is very important that 
the bride should receive the little bone called ‘hug ma 
close’ (anglice ‘sidesman,’ or side-bone), for she who 
gets it on her wedding-day is sure to be happy in her 
husband. . 
‘To rub shoulders with the bride or bridegroom is 
deemed an augury of speedy marriage: and, again, she 
who receives from the bride a piece of cheese, cut by 
her before leaving the table, will be the next bride 
among the company.
-P-A-G-E-52
22 LIFE AND DEATH OF MAN. 
Dinner over, the bride sticks her knife into the cheese, 
and all at table endeavour to seize it. He who 
succeeds without cutting his fingers in the struggle, 
thereby ensures happiness in his married life. The 
knife is called ‘ the best man’s prize,’ since commonly 
the ‘best man’ secures it. Should he fail to do so, he 
will indeed be unfortunate in his matrimonial views. 
The knife is, at any rate, a prize for male hands only; 
the maidens try to possess themselves of a ‘ shaping’ of 
the wedding-dress, for use in certain divinations regard- 
ing their future husbands. And the bride herself should 
wear something borrowed—for what reason I am not 
informed. 
It should perhaps have been mentioned sooner, that 
as the newly-married wife enters her new home on re- 
turning from kirk, one of the oldest inhabitants of the 
neighbourhood, who has been stationed on the thresh- 
old, throws a plateful of short-bread over her head, so 
that it falls outside. A scramble ensues, for it is 
deemed very-fortunate to get a piece of the short-bread, 
and dreams of sweethearts attend its being placed under 
the pillow. A variation of this custom extends as far 
south as the East Riding of Yorkshire, where, on the 
bride’s arrival at her father’s door, a plate of cake is 
flung from an upper window upon the crowd below. 
An augury is then drawn from the fate which attends 
the plate; the more pieces it breaks into the better; 
if it reach the ground unbroken, the omen is very un- 
favourable. . 
The custom of passing bridecake through the wedding- 
ring, and placing it under the pillow, to dream upon, 
and that of throwing a shoe after the bride and bride- 
groom, are sometimes claimed as peculiarly northern. 
If so, they have travelled southwards very steadily, for
-P-A-G-E-53
THROWING THE SHOR. 23 
they now prevail in every county in England. This 
last observance is usually said to be ‘for luck,’ but a 
writer in ‘Notes and Queries’ (vol. vii. p. 411) suggests 
that it is rather a symbol of renunciation of all right 
in the bride by her father or guardian, and the trans- 
ference of it to her husband. He quotes Ps. lx. 8, 
‘Over Edom have I cast out my shoe,’ as meaning, ‘I 
have wholly cast it off;’ and further illustrates the 
idea by a reference to Ruth iv. 7, 8. Ruth’s kinsman, 
it will be remembered, refused to marry her, and to 
redeem her inheritance; therefore, ‘as it was the cus- 
tom in Israel concerning redeeming and concerning 
changing, that a man plucked off his shoe and de- 
livered it to his neighbour, the kinsman plucked off 
his shoe, as a public renunciation of Ruth and of his . 
own claim of premarriage.’ : 
The northern counties of England have, however, 
their own exclusively local wedding customs. I am in- 
formed, by the Rev. J. Barnby, that a wedding in the 
Dales of Yorkshire is indeed a thing to see; that no- 
thing can be imagined comparable to it in wildness and 
obstreperous mirth. The bride and bridegroom may 
possibly be a little subdued, but his friends are like 
men bereft of reason. They career round the bridal 
party like Arabs of the desert, galloping over ground 
on which, in cooler moments, they would hesitate even 
1 Tt may be enquired, however, whether there is any connexion be- 
tween this custom and the usage of Swodish brides, to let a shoe slip 
off or drop a handkerchief, in the hope. that the bridegroom, from 
politeness, will stoop to pick it up. If he does so it will be his lot to 
submit, de. to bend his back, all through his married life. A good 
deal of Swedish bridal folk lore points to the desire for mastery: ¢.9., 
the bride must endeavour to see her bridegroom before he. sees her, to 
place her foot before his during the marriage ceremony, to sit down 
first in the bridal chair, and all that she may bear sway.—Thorpe’s 
Mythology, vol, ii, p. 108.
-P-A-G-E-54
24 LIFE AND DEATH OF MAN. 
to walk a horse—shouting all the time, and firing vol~ 
Jeys from the guns they carry with them. Next they 
will dash along the road in advance of the party, car- 
rying the whisky-bottle, and compelling everyone they 
meet to pledge the newly-married pair. ‘One can 
guess,’ he adds, ‘what the Border mosstroopers were, 
by seeing the Dalesmen at a wedding.’ In rural parts, 
too, of the county of Durham, the bridal party is es- 
corted to church by men armed with guns, which they 
fire again and again close to the ears of bride and brides- 
maids, terrifying them sometimes not a little, At 
Guisborough, in Cleveland, I am told that these guns 
are fired over the heads of the newly-married couple 
all the way from church, There, too, it has been cus- 
tomary for the bridegroom to offer a handful of money 
together with the ring to the clergyman; out of thisthe 
fees were taken, and the overplus returned. 
Through Cleveland, he who gives the bride away 
claims the first kiss in right of his temporary paternity. 
One clerical friend of mine, however, declares that it 
is the privilege of the parson who ties the knot; and 
though he cannot aver that he has ever availed himself 
of it, he knows an old north-country clergyman who 
was reported so to do. Another tells me that a brother- 
clergyman, a stranger in the country, after performing 
a marriage in a country village in Yorkshire, was sur- 
prised to see the party keep together, as if expecting 
something more. ‘What are you waiting for?’ he 
asked, at last. ‘ Please, sir,’ was the bridegroom’s an- 
swer, ‘ye’ve no kissed Molly” And my old friend, the 
late Dr. Raine, used to relate how the Rev. T. E., 
Sacrist of the Cathedral and Vicar of Merrington, in- 
variably kept up the custom when he performed the 
marriage ceremony, and this plainly as a matter of
-P-A-G-E-55
HOT Fors. 25 
obligation, for he was one of the most shy and retiring 
of men. Nay, I can testify that within the last ten 
years, a fair lady from the county of Durham, who was 
married in the South of England, so undoubtedly 
reckoned upon the clerical salute, that, after waiting for 
it in vain, she boldly took the initiative, and bestowed 
a kiss upon the much-amazed south-country vicar. 
A singular local custom still exists in the village of 
Whitburn, near Sunderland—that of sending what are 
called hot pots to church, to meet the bride and bride- 
groom on coming out. A gentleman of that place thus 
describes what took place at his own marriage last year: 
‘ After the vestry scene, the bridal party having formed 
in procession for leaving the church, we were ‘stopped 
in the porch by a row of five or six women, ranged to- 
our left hand, each holding a large mug with a cloth 
over it. These were in turn presented to me, and 
handed by me to my wife, who, after taking a sip, 
returned it to me. It was: then passed to the next 
couple, and so on in the same form to all the party. 
The composition in these mugs was mostly, I am sorry to 
say, simply horrible ; one or two were very fair, one very 
good. They are sent to the church by all classes, and are 
considered a great compliment. I have never heard of 
this custom elsewhere. Here it has existed within the me- 
mory of the oldest inhabitant, and an aged fisherwoman, 
who has been married some sixty-five years, tells me that 
at her wedding there were seventy hot pots.’ 
Another old wedding usageseems confined to Yorksbire. 
In remote parts of that county it is the custom to pour a 
kettle-full of boiling water over the doorstep, justafter the 
bride has left her old home; and they say that before it 
dries up, another marriage is sure to be agreed on, 
In many of the rural parts of Cumberland this curious
-P-A-G-E-56
26 LIFE AND DEATH OF MAN. 
practice exists, When the lover of a Cumbrian maiden 
proves unfaithful to her, she is, by way of consolation, 
rubbed with pease-straw by the neighbouring lads; and 
should a Cumbrian youth lose his sweetheart, through 
her marriage with his rival, the same sort of comfort is 
administered to him by the lasses of the village. This 
- is illustrated by the following verse from an old Cum- 
brian: ballad :— 
For Jock the young Laird was new wedded, 
His auld sweetheart Jennio linked wae, 
‘While some were aw tittern and flyein 
The. lads rubbed her down wi’ pease-straw. 
This reminds me of a custom very common among 
the schoolboys in the neighbouring county of Durham, 
when, if a boy is so unlucky as to fall into trouble, and 
so weak as to show it by crying, he is quickly beset by 
his companions, who rub him down with their coat- 
sleeves, and that in such rough style as to make him 
forget past troubles in present discomfort. 
It is unlucky for a woman to marry a man whose 
surname begins with the same letter as her own, for: 
If you change the name and not the letter, 
‘You change for the worse and not for the better. 
A Yorkshire wedding is, by rights, wound up by a 
race for aribbon. In Cleveland this ribbon is given by 
the bridegroom, as he leaves the church, and all who 
choose run for it, in sight of the house where the 
wedding-feast is held. All the racers, winner and losers 
alike, are entitled to a glass of spirits each; and 
accordingly, as soon as the race is over, they present 
themselves at the house, and ask for their ‘lowance 
without any particular invitation. At the village of 
»Melsonby, near Darlington, and in the adjoining district,
-P-A-G-E-57
FIRING THE SvITHY. 27 
the bride was placed as winning-post, holding the 
ribbon in her hand, and the winner claimed a kiss on 
receiving it. I am told that, on one occasion, the bride, 
being a Methodist, refused, from conscientious scruples, 
to give the ribbon. There was much dissatisfaction 
through the place, and the youths revenged themselves 
after the traditional manner of punishing stingy brides. 
They fired the stithy at her; that is, they placed a 
charge of gunpowder in the stith, or anvil of the black- 
smith’s shop, and fired it as she passed on her way from 
church. 
In the neighbourhood of Leeds, and I believe in the 
North of England generally, it is counted unlucky for 
a young woman to attend church when her banns are 
published ; her children run the risk of being deaf and 
dumb. But there is no chance at all of a family, unless, 
when she retires on the wedding-night, her bridesmaids 
lay her stotkings across. 
I may close our collection of bridal folk lore by two 
little sayings rife in the county of Durham. The first 
of the bridal pair to go to sleep on the wedding-night, 
will be the first to die; and the wife who loses her 
wedding ring incurs the loss of her husband’s affection. 
The breaking of the ring forebodes death. 
The portents of death related in the Wilkie MS. are 
numerous indeed. Thus he who meets a Border funeral 
is certain soon to die, unless he bares his head, turns, 
and accompanies the procession some distance. If the 
coffin is carried by bearers he must take a lift. This 
done, if he bows to the company, he may turn and go 
on his way without fear. . 
Again, if, at a funeral, the sun shines brightly on the 
face of one among the attendants, it marks him for the 
next to be laid in that churchyard; or if the sound of
-P-A-G-E-58
28 LIFE AND DEATH OF MAN. 
the ‘ mools’ falling on the coffin be heard by any person 
at a considerable distance from the spot, it presages a 
death in that person’s family. 
A crowing hen is looked upon with fear and suspicion 
far and wide. According to the Northamptonshire 
proverb, 
A whistling woman and crowing hen, 
Ave neither fit for God nor men. 
in Normandy they say, ‘Une poule qui chante le 
coget et une fille qui siffle, portent malheur dans la 
maison ;’ and in Cornwall, ‘A whistling woman.and a 
crowing hen are the two unluckiest things under the 
sun. ., 
The former delinquent is much dreaded on the coast 
of Yorkshire by the seafaring part of the population. 
A few years ago, when a party of friends were going 
on board a vessel at Scarborough, the captain as- 
tonished them by declining to allow one of them to 
enter it. ‘ Not that young lady,’ he said; ‘she whistles, 
Curiously enough, the vessel was lost on her next 
voyage; so, had the poor girl set foot on it, the mis-. 
fortune would certainly have been ascribed to her. It 
is remarkable that no miner in Devonshire or Cornwall 
whistles underground, or allows others to do so. I have 
conversed with them about it, and do not gather that 
they think it unlucky, but unseemly and irreverent. 
All assure me that it is never done in a mine even by 
the youngest boy. 
. A crowing hen is counted on the Borders a forerunner 
of death. Thus a few years ago, we are told, an old 
woman in the parish of East Kilbride heard one of her 
“hens crow loudly on the top of a dyke before her house, 
She mentioned the circumstance to a neighbour, saying 
that no good would come of it, and accordingly her
-P-A-G-E-59
PORTENTS OF DEATH. a) 
husband soon died. About a month afterwards she 
heard the creature again, and within a few days tidings 
reached her of the death of her only son. A week later 
the hen crowed once more, and the eldest daughter died. 
On this the old woman was roused to desperation; she 
seized the warning bird, wrung its neck, and burned it. 
Mr. Wilkie records the following singular portent of 
death, which took place about seven years before it was 
related to him :~—~‘ A farmer’s wife, who resided on the 
banks of the Ale, near St. Boswell’s, looking out at 
window, thought she saw a funeral approaching ; and at 
once mentioned the circumstance to some neighbours, 
then with her in the house. They ran out to look, but 
came back and sat down again, saying she must be mis- 
taken, for there was nothing of the kind to beseen ; the 
woman felt restless, however, and out of spirits; she could 
not help going to the window again, and again she saw 
the funeral moving on. Her friends ran out-of-doors 
and looked along the road, but still could perceive 
nothing; a third time she went to the window, and ex- 
claimed, “ It is fast coming on, and will soon be at the 
door.” No other person could discern anything; but 
within half an hour a confused noise was heard outside, 
and the farm-servants entered, bearing her husband’s 
lifeless body. He had died suddenly, by a fall from his 
cart.’ } 
1 With this Border portent, compare the following narration :—‘ Dr. 
Abraham Vander Meer, an upright and zealous Reformer, relates in his 
Memorabilia, that his grandmother, while residing ut the Hague, being 
one summer night unable to sleep, placed herself, about four o'clock in 
the morning, at the window, and there saw a coffin coming up the Spui 
Straab, but without anyone else seeming to notice it. It moved on until 
it stood ap erect before a house, whero it vanished in an open window.

30 LIFE AND DEATH OF MAN. 
The presages of death on the Border are very nume- 
ous: eg., the sound of bells in the night, the chirping of 
crickets, lights of a circular form seen in the air, when 
there is no fire or candle, the dead chack or death-watch, 
. acall by night or day in the voice of some absent person, 
a gripe of the arm or leg by an invisible clay-cold hand, 
the howling of dogs before your house-door, hens bring- 
ing off a brood all hen-birds, or laying eggs with double 
yolks, the birth of lambs deformed or with superfluous 
limbs, the chirping of fish long after they have been 
taken out of the water, sounds as though the house were 
falling down, magpies flying round the house or preced- 
ing you on the way to church, ravens croaking on or 
near it, swords falling out of their scabbards—all these 
are tokens of approaching death; but the most fatal of 
all is for a man to see his own wraith walking to or from 
him at noon or before sunset. 
The wraith is an apparition exactly like a living per- 
son, and its appearance, whether to that person or to 
another, is commonly thought an omen of death.* These 
apparitions are sometimes called ‘fetches,’in Cumberland 
‘swarths,’ and in Yorkshire ‘wafts.’ Of waff I have two 
examples, from the East Riding of Yorkshire. The first 
was narrated, to the clergyman from whom I received it, 
by an old man of Danby, in Cleveland, eighty-two years 
of age, and highly respectable as to character. Some 
years before he was passing one evening by an uncle’s 
‘house, and, seeing the glow of firelight streaming through 
the window, looked in. To-his great surprise he saw 
his uncle, who had long been ‘bed-fast’ in the room 
above, seated in his former place in the ‘newkin.’ He 
‘was astonished—still there could be no mistake; the form 
and features were those of his relation, and he further as- 
sured himself of the fact by asecond look. He entered
-P-A-G-E-61
WRAITHS, 31 
the house to obtain an explanation; but the room was 
dark, the seat empty, and the old man lying upstairs 
jn his bed. But the old man’s death took place before 
long. 
A second case of this kind is said to have happened, 
at Whitby, to a tradesman suffering from stone, and 
ordered to the hospital at York for an operation. Before 
he set out, the patient said it was in vain, he should not 
return alive; he bad seen his own waff, and knew he 
should die during the operation, or after it. His belief 
was verified: the operation was performed, but he did 
not long survive it.! 
‘The Vicar of Stamfordham has kindly communicated 
to me two cases of ‘wraiths, or apparitions, from his 
parish. The first is of a poor woman, called Esther 
Morton, of Black Heddon, who went out gathering sticks 
on the ground of a neighbouring farmer. Looking up, 
she saw him before her, and turned quickly to get out 
of his way. Then she remembered he was ill in bed and 
could not possibly be there, so she went home much 
alarmed, and found he had just died. 
Again, one William Elliott, of the same place, saw his 
neighbour Mary Brown cross the fold-yard and disappear 
in a straw house. Knowing her to be very ill, he made 
instant enquiries, and discovered that she had died at 
the moment of his seeing her. 
These Yorkshire stories recall to my memory an 
incident in which the ‘ waff’? was no prophet of death, 
but an instrument for saving life. The musician Gluck, 
Picini’s rival in Paris about 100 years ago, made some 
stay in one of the Belgian cities—Ghent, I believe. 
While there he was accustomed to spend the evening 
with friends, and, returning late to his lodging, to let 
himself in with a key. One moonlight evening, while
-P-A-G-E-62
32 LIFE AND DEATH OF MAN, 
going home as usual, he observed before him a figure 
resembling himself. It took every turn through the 
streeta which he was accustomed to take, and finally, 
on reaching the door, drew out a key, opened it, and 
entered. On this the musician turned round in some 
perturbation, went back to his friends, and begged to 
be taken in for the night. The next morning they 
accompanied him to his lodging, and found that the 
heavy wooden roof of Gluck’s sleeping-room had fallen 
down in the night and covered the floor, It was plain 
that had he passed the night there he must have been 
killed. 
But to return to the omens in the Wilkie MS. 
Some of them are more or less remarked in every part 
of our island—snch as the death-watch, the croaking 
raven, or the solitary magpie; nor is it matter of 
astonishment that-when the mind is impressed, by the 
awe of sickness and impending death in our household, 
we are prone to notice and brood over sounds and sights 
which seem to connect themselves with our anxieties 
and sorrows. The howling of dogs is a widely-known 
death-omen. We find it in every part of our island, in 
France and Germany, and even in Constantinople. A 
close observer, who has seen the omen given, and noted 
its fulfilment, describes the dog as very uneasy till it 
can get under the death-chamber. If the house stands 
within an inclosure, and it cannot get in, it will run 
round the premises, or pace up and down before them. 
If it succeeds in forcing an entry, it will stop under the 
window, howl horribly, finish with three tremendous 
barks, and hurry away. Mr. Kelly, who relates this,! 
adds that the dog is an attendant on the dead in the 
German as in the Aryan mythology, that dogs see ghosts, 
1 Indo-European Tradition and Folk Lore, p. 110.
-P-A-G-E-63
Loon DEATH-OMENS, : 33 
and that when Hela, the goddess of death, walks abroad, 
invisible to human. eyes, she is seen by the dogs. Again, 
in the North of Englandthe flight of jackdaws or swallows 
down the chimney is held to presage death, as well as 
the appearance of a trio of butterflies flying together. 
So does a winding-sheet, or piece of curled tallow in 
the candle, called in Scotland a ‘dead spale.’ Three 
raps given by no human hand are said also to give 
warning of death. Such were heard a few. years ago, 
at Windy Walls, near Stamfordham, in Northumberland, 
on the outside of a window-shutter, and the same night 
a man belonging to the house fell accidentally off a 
cart and was killed. Again, if thirteen persons sit down’ 
to eat together one of them will shortly die. This belief 
is widely spread, and doubtless originated in the re- 
membrance of the thirteen who sat down at the last 
Paschal Supper, and of the fate of Judas. 
Another death-omen is the crowing of a cock at dead 
of night. A lady in the East Riding of Yorkshire tells 
me that a few years ago, a cook, who had recently come 
to her from the north of that county, told her one 
morning, with tears in her eyes, that she should not be 
able to stay long in her place, for her sister was dead 
or dying. The mistress naturally concluded that the 
tidings had come by post that morning, but it turned 
out that such was not the case." The cock had crowed 
at midnight on two following nights, and as she had 
not heard from her sister for some time, she was doubt- 
less ill, if not already dead. Happily the good woman’s 
fears were groundless, and she lived some time in my 
informant’s service. 
Again, the flying or hovering of birds around a house, 
and their resting on the window-sill, or tapping against 
the pane, portends death. This belief is widely spread, 
D
-P-A-G-E-64
34 LIFE AND DEATH OF MAN. 
and I cannot divest myself of the notion that there is a 
sympathy between us and the animal creation, which 
comes to view in times of sorrow. I am permitted to 
mention that the death of a clergyman of some emi- 
nence in the town of Hull, recently, was preceded by 
the flight of a pure white pigeon around the house, and 
its resting again and again on his window-sill. And the 
Vicar of Fishlake, in the West Riding, informs me that 
one of his parishioners mentioned the same portent to 
him; telling him, as an illustration, of a Primitive 
Methodist preacher, a very worthy man, who had fallen 
down dead in the pulpit soon after giving out his text. 
‘ And not many hours before,’ she went on, ‘I had seen a 
white pigeon light on a tree hard by, and I’d said to a 
neighbour I were sure summat were going to happen.’ 
The following form of divination seems purely Nor- 
thumbrian. After a death has taken place in a family, 
the straw or chaff from the bed of the departed is taken 
into an open place and burned. Among its ashes the 
survivors look for a footprint, and that member of the 
family whose foot fits the impression will be the next 
to die. 
Yorkshire too has its own manner of enquiring who 
will be taken from this world. Those who are curious 
to know about the death of their fellow-parishioners, 
must keep watch in the church-porch on St. Mark’s Eve, 
for an hour on each side of midnight for three succes- 
sive years. On the third year they will see the forms 
of those doomed to die within the twelyemonth 
passing one by one into the church. If the watcher 
fall asleep during his vigil he will die himself during 
the year. I have heard, however, of one case in which 
the intimation was given by the sight of the watcher’s 
own form and features. It is that of an old woman at
-P-A-G-E-65
ST, MARK’S VIGIL.. 35 
Scarborough, who kept St. Mark’s vigil in the porch of. 
St. Mary’s in that town abouteighty years ago. Figure 
after figure glided into the church, turning round to 
her as they went in, so that she recognised their fami- 
liar faces. At last a figure turned and gazed at her; 
she knew herself, screamed, and fell senseless to the 
ground, Her neighbours found her there in the morn- 
ing, and carried her home, but she did not long survive 
the shock. An old man who recently died at Fishlake, 
in the West Riding of Yorkshire, was in the habit of 
keeping these vigils, and was in consequence an object 
of some dread to his neighbours, The old sexton at 
did so too, in order, it was said, to count the 
gains of the coming year. I have heard of the rite in 
Cleveland too, and at Teesdale, and one instance has 
come before me at Ford in Northumberland. 
Another mode of divining into futurity has also been 
resorted to in Yorkshire, called cauff-riddling, and was 
thus practised. The barn-doors must be set wide open, 
a riddle and some chaff must be procured, and those 
who wish to pry into the future must go into the barn 
at midnight, and in turn commence the process of 
ridding. Should the riddler be doomed to die during 
the year, two persons will be seen passing by the open 
barn-doors carrying a coffin; in the other case nothing 
will be visible. 
Not many years ago two men and a woman went toa 
barn near Malton, in Yorkshire, on St, Mark's Eve, to 
riddle cauff. All the requisite observances were at- 
tended to; the men took their turns, but nothing was 
seen; then the woman began to riddle. Scarcely had 
the chaff began to fall on the floor when all saw the 
ominous pair of coffin-bearers passing by. There was 
a moment’s pause ; the men rushed out to look, but all 
D2

36 | LIFE-AND: DEATA OF MAN. 
had disappeared; there was no living creature in sight, 
The woman died within the year. This story was 
related to my informant by one who knew the persons. 
concerned, and spoke of them by name. 
The rites accompanying the saining or blessing of a 
corpse in the Scottish Lowlands are given at some 
length in the Wilkie MS. They are as follows :— 
‘When a body has been washed and laid out, one of 
the oldest women present must light a candle, and wave 
it three times around the corpse. Then she must 
measure three handfuls of common salt into an earthen- 
ware plate, and lay it on the breast. Lastly, she 
arranges three ‘toom’ or empty dishes on the hearth, as 
near as possible to the fire; and all the attendants going 
. out of the room return into it backwards, repeating 
this ‘rhyme of saining:” 
Thrice the torchie, thrice the saltie, 
Thrice the dishies toom for “loffie” (é.e. praise) 
These three times three ye must wave round 
The corpse, until it sleep sound. 
Sleep sound and wake nane, 
Till to heaven the soul’s gane. 
If ye want that soul to dee 
Fetch the torch frae th’ Elleree ; 
Gin ye want that soul to live, 
Between the dishes place a sieve, 
An it sall have a fair, fair shrive. 
This rite is called Dishaloof. Sometimes, as is named 
in the verses, a sieve is placed between the dishes, and 
she who is so fortunate as to place her hand in it, is 
held to do most for the soul. If all miss the sieve, 
it augurs ill for the departed. Meanwhile all the 
windows in the house are opened, in order to give the, 
soul free egress. The dishes are placed near the fire, 
from a notion that the soul resembles a flame, and
-P-A-G-E-67
SAINING A CORPSE. , ‘37 
hovers round the hearth for a certain period after 
death. : 
_In some of the western counties, however, the dishes 
are set upon a table or 4 ‘bunker’ (as they call a long 
chest) close to the deathbed; and it is actually said that 
while the attendants sit with. their hands in the dishes 
they ‘spae,’ or tell fortunes, sing songs, or repeat rhymes, 
in the middle of which the corpse, it is averred, has 
been known to rise frowning, and place its cold hand in 
one of the dishes, thus presaging death to her whose 
hand was in that dish already. : 
The Dishaloof so far over, the company join hands 
and dance round the dishes, singing this burden, ‘ A dis, 
a dis, a dis, a green grisa, a dis, a dis, a dis.’ Bread, 
cheese, and spirits are then placed on the table, and, 
when the company have partaken of them, they are at 
liberty to go home. 
The candle for ‘saining’ should be procured from a 
suspected witch or wizard, a seer or Elleree, or from a 
person with ‘schloof,’ or flat feet, ‘ringlit-eyed,’ that is 
with a great portion of white in the eye, or ‘lang-lipit,’ 
that is, with thick projecting lips; for all these persons 
are unlucky, and, in this affair, unlucky really means 
fortunate in the extreme. Unless the old mosstroopers 
ate belied, they preferred for saining a torch made from 
the fat of aslaughtered enemy, or at least of a murdered 
man. The saining candle must be kept burning through 
the night, and the table covered with a cloth so long as 
the dead body remains in the house. Some people also 
make a pointof turning the cat out-of-doors all the time: 
The corpse must be watched, tillits burial, by one of 
its kindred and a stranger, who may be relieved, when 
weary, by another relation and another stranger. In point 
of fact, however, they are seldom left to themselves,
-P-A-G-E-68
38 LIFE AND DEATH OF MAN, 
Neighbours assemble from a great distance to join them, 
and keep what is called ‘a sitting’ while the sun is 
above the horizon, or after dark ‘a lykewake” These 
gatherings are common in North Wales also, but whereas 
the Welsh pass the night in reading the Scriptures and 
singing Psalms, a strange sort of merriment seems 
to have characterised the Scotch ‘lykewake. Songs 
were sung and games played—Blind Harrie, for ex- 
ample, according to the old song of the ‘Humble 
Beggar :” 
It happened ill, it happened worse, 
It happened sae that he did dee, 
And wha d’ye think war at the lykewake 
But lads and lasses o’ high degree ? 
Some were blithe and some were sad, 
And some they played at Blind Harrie, 
But suddenly uprose the auld carle 
‘I rede ye gude folk tak tent o’ me.’ 
Games at cards are also played on these occasions, the 
coffin, incredible as it may appear, being the card- 
table, while the round table on which the candle is 
placed may on no account be used. It is imperative 
that every watcher at a lykewake should touch the 
corpse with his hand, to keep him from dreaming of the 
dead, or brooding over any evil occurrence which may 
have taken place during the watch. . For things do not 
always go right on these occasions. Thus tradition tells 
how once the corpse arose, sat upon the bed, and 
frowned dreadfully, though without speaking, an unseen 
hand having previously moved the plate of salt to the 
rack of the bed. It was plain that something essential 
had been omitted in the saining, or that the attendants 
had been performing some unhallowed rites. An old 
woman, eminent for her piety, was hastily summoned in 
 
-P-A-G-E-69
SAINING A CORPSE. 39 
this emergency. She came and found the room empty, 
the attendants having all fled in terror. Drawing her 
Bible from her pocket, the old woman began to read it 
aloud, on which the corpse ceased to frown, and fell 
slowly back upon the bed. Closing her book, she 
prayed aloud; then covered the corpse, replaced the 
plate of salt upon its breast, and prayed again. All 
continuing still, she fetched water, washed her hands, 
and brought in the terrified attendants, who were 
huddled together round the door of the house, assuring 
them that if they abstained from evil amusements 
the devil would not molest them any more. 
On another occasion it was reported that while hide- 
and-seek was going on at a lykewake, some young men 
took the dead body out of the coffin, and laid one of 
their number in its place to hide. Search being made 
for the youth, he was discovered in the coffin, quite 
dead, but the corpse they had come to watch could no- 
where be found. It was believed in the neighbourhood 
that it had been carried off by the fairies, and that the 
young man had been slain by the evil spirit. 
A paper in Richardson’s ¢ Local Historian’s Table 
Book’ (vol. iii, p. 66) confirms and illustrates this 
account of a lykewake on the Horders. It adds a few 
particulars : the shrouding of the looking-glass, tointimate 
that all vanity, all care for earthly beauty, are over with 
the deceased, and the stopping and shrouding of the 
clock, to show that with him time is over; and it pain- 
fully evinces that the solemnity of the occasion did not 
preclude practical jokes, which to us appear profane 
and sacrilegious in the highest degree. 
Some traces of these Scottish rites may be found in 
widely-separated parts of our Island. I have seen the 
plate of salt on the breast of the dead in the North of 
 
-P-A-G-E-70
40 LIFE AND DEATH OF MAN. 
England, and heard of its use in the Isle of Man, as 
well as in Wales, Hertfordshire, and Somersetshire. 
Probably its use has been very general, and this as an 
emblem of incorruption and eternity. 
Sir Walter Scott considered that the word. ‘sleet,’ in 
the chorus of the lykewake dirge, is a corruption of 
* selt’ or ‘salt:’ 
This ae night, this ae night, 
Every night and all, 
Fire and sleete and candlelighte 
And Christe receive thy sawle. 
The custom of opening the door at the time of death 
is also widespread. I have heard of it as far south as 
Spain, and also in Germany. My readers cannot forget 
how at the smuggler’s death in the Kaim of Durn- 
cleugh, Meg Merrilies unbars the door, and lifts the 
latch, saying :— 
Open lock, end strife, 
Come death, and pass life, 
As to the touching of the corpse,’by those who come 
to look at it, this is still expected by the poor of 
Durham, on the part of those who come to their house 
while a dead body is lying in it, in token that they 
wished no ill to the departed, and were in peace and 
amity with him. 
No doubt this custom grew out of the belief, once 
universal among Northern nations, that a corpse would 
bleed at the touch of the murderer. In King James 
the First’s ‘Deemonology’, we read: ‘Ina secret murder, 
if the dead carkasse be at any time thereafter handled 
by the murderer, it will gush out of blood, as if the 
blood were crying to Heaven for revenge of the mur- 
derer.” And it is mentioned in a note to chap. v. of 
the ‘Fair Maid of Perth,’ that this bleeding of a corpse 
 
-P-A-G-E-71
_ DEATH WITH THE TIDE. 4} 
was urged as an evidence of guilt in the High Court of 
Justiciary at Edinburgh, as late as 1688, ‘The practice 
of covering or removing the looking-glass from the 
chamber of death extends into the northern counties 
of England, and this not only for the cause assigned 
above. The invisible world trenches closely upon the 
visible one in the chamber of death; and I believe 
that a dread is felt of some spiritual being imaging 
himself forth in the blank surface of the mirror.’ 
I may here mention that in Denmark it is forbidden 
to bury a corpse in the clothes of a living person, lest, 
as the clothes rot, that person wastes away and perishes. 
It is said there too that one must not weep over’ the 
dying, still less allow tears to fall on them; it will 
hinder their resting in the grave. 
It is a common belief along the east coast of England, 
from Northumberland to Kent, that deaths mostly occur 
during the falling of the tide. As Mr. Peggotty ex- 
plained to David Copperfield by poor Barkis’ bedside, 
© People can’t die along the coast, except when the tide’s 
pretty nigh out. They can’t be born unless its pretty 
nigh in—not properly born till flood, He’s agoing out 
with the tide—he’s agoing out with the tide. It’s ebb 
at half arter three, slack-water half an hour. If he 
lives till it turns, he’ll hold his own till past the flood, 
and go out with the next tide’ And after many hours 
1 Tsuspect that the true reason for shronding the looking-glass 
before a funeral is that given me in Warwickshire, that if you look 
into a mirror in the death-chamber, you will see the corpse looking 
over your shoulder. I have heard the same superstition in Devonshire. 
In the West Riding of Yorkshire there is a strong feeling against 
burying a woman with her rings or jewellery, A gentleman told me 
that when his mother died, he was desirous of leaving on her hand her 
wedding-ring, but was reproved for the wish by the women who laid 
her out. “Ye mun no send her to God wi’ her trinkets about her,’ they 
said.—S.B.G. 
 
-P-A-G-E-72
42 LIFE AND DEATH OF MAN. 
watching, ‘it being low-water he went out with the tide.’ 
In some extracts which I have seen of old date, from 
the parish register of Heslidon, near Hartlepool, the 
state of the tide at the time of death is named: ‘The 
xith daye of Maye, A.D. 1595, at vi. of ye clocke in the 
morninge, being full water, Mr. Henrye Mitford, of 
Hoolam, died at. Neweastel, and was buried the xvi. daie, 
being Sondaie, at evening prayer; the hired preacher 
maid ye sermon.’—‘ The xvii. daie of Maie, at xii. of ye 
clock at noon, being lowe water, Mrs. Barbara Mitford 
died, and was buried the xviii. daie of Maie, at ix. of the 
clocke. Mr. Holsworth maid ye sermon.’ Indeed, the 
belief must be of some antiquity, and must have found 
its way inland, since Sir John Falstaff is recorded to 
have ‘parted even just. between twelve and one, e’en at 
turning o’ the tide.” I cannot hear of it on the south 
or west coast of England. A friend suggests to me that 
there may be some slight foundation for this belief in 
the change of temperature, which undoubtedly does 
take place on the change of tide, and which may 
act on the flickering spark of life, extinguishing it as 
the ebbing sea recedes. 
The obtuseness of feeling with regard to death, shown 
in the Border Lykewake, certainly extends southward. 
A friend tells me of two instances in Yorkshire, 
where persons have had their coffins made some years 
before their death, and have used them to keep bread 
and cheese in. Such was certainly the custom of an old 
brother at Sherburn Hospital, who was well known to 
many of the inhabitants of Durham. I myself saw the 
coffin set up against the wall, and witnessed the old man 
opening it to take out a jug of milk, which he offered 
to the young lad who accompanied me. The Master of 
Sherburn Hospital informs me that this old brother was
-P-A-G-E-73
SLAUGHTER OF ANIMALS PASSING OVER THE covrin. 43 
in his way a luxurious man, with a due regard for erea- 
ture comforts; and that, having a decidedly Roman nose, 
he had caused a corresponding cavity to be made in the 
inside of the coffin lid, for fear the projecting member 
should be inconvenienced. An old Yorkshire woman 
was, I am told, very explicit in the directions she gave 
about her coffin. She ordered two holes to be made in 
its lid, that, when the devil came in at one hole to catch 
her, she might slip out at the other! 
A very singular belief prevails along the Borders, of 
which I find no mention in any book of folk lore,. 
though there is this passing allusion to it in ‘ Pennant’s 
Tour in Scotland :’—* All fire is extinguished where a 
corpse is kept, and it is reckoned so ominous for a dog 
or cat to pass over it, that the poor animal is killed 
without mercy.’ Two instances of this slaughter were 
recently related to the Rev. J. F. Bigge, by an old Nor- 
thumbrian hind. In one case, just as a funeral was 
about to leave the house, the cat jumped over the coffin, 
and no one would move till the cat was destroyed. In 
the other, as a funeral party were coming from a lonely 
house on a fell, carrying the coffin, because they could 
not procure a cart, they set it down to reat themselves, 
and a colly dog jumped over it. It was felt by all that 
the dog must be killed, without hesitation, before they 
proceeded farther, and killed it was. 
It is said, in the county of Durham, that the bodies 
of the drowned will float on the ninth day; and again, 
that if a gun be fired over a dead body lying at the 
bottom of the sea or river, the concussion will break the 
gall-bladder, and cause the body to float. A friend 
informs me that he has seen this done twice at Stock~- 
ton, but without success. He also tells me that a loaf 
weighted with quicksilver, if allowed to float on the 
eee prea i rine A a cess eae in a ote ne

44. : LIFE AND DEATH OF MAN, 
water, is said to swim towards and stand over the place 
where the body lies. This is a very widely-spread 
belief. I have heard of it not only in several parts of 
‘England, but in Ireland, and among the North-American’ 
Indians. To its firm hold in the city of Durham I can 
myself bear witness. When a boy, I have seen persons 
endeavouring to discover the corpses of the drowned in 
this manner in the River Wear, near to Stoker’s Wall; 
and ten years ago, the friends of one Christopher Lum- 
‘ley sought for his body in the Smallhope, near Lanches- 
ter, in the county of Durham, by the aid of a loaf of 
bread with a lighted candle in it. Indeed, the same 
means were practiséd in the autumn of the year 1860, 
within two miles of the city of Durham. A little child 
named Charles Colling fell into the Wear at Shincliffe, 
on the 21st of October in that year, and was drowned. 
His friends, after vainly trying the usual methods of 
finding the body, charged a loaf of bread with quick- 
silver, and floated it on the stream. Long and earnestly 
was its course watched, but all in vain; it floated 
onwards without pausing to mark the resting~place of 
the little child, and though the body was ultimately 
recovered it was by other means. Itis remarkable that 
a somewhat similar practice prevails in Ireland, and even 
among the North-American Indians. 
The old superstition that no one can die in a bed 
containing the feathers of pigeons or game-fowl, can 
scarcely be called local, for we hear of it in many differ- 
ent parts of England. Still it does hold its ground in 
the North, and in Yorkshire the same is said of cock’s 
feathers. The Russian peasantry, too, have a strong 
feeling against using pigeon’s feathers in beds. They 
consider it sacrilegious, the dove being the emblem of 
the Holy Spirit. Some Yorkshire people declare that
-P-A-G-E-75
THE DEAD CARRIED WITH THE SUN. 45: 
no one can die easy on any bed, and will lay a dying 
man on the floor, to facilitate the departure of the: 
soul. 
A singular circumstance has been related to me, as 
having occurred a few years ago ata funeral, in the 
village of Stranton, near West Hartlepool. 
The vicar was standing at the churchyard gate’ 
awaiting the arrival of the funeral party, when to his 
surprise the whole group, who had arrived within a 
few yards of him, suddenly wheeled round and made the 
circuit of the churchyard wall, thus traversing its west, 
north, and east boundaries, and making the distance 
some five or six times greater than was necessary. The 
vicar, astonished at the proceeding, asked the sexton 
the reason of so extraordinary a movement. The re- 
ply was as follows, ‘Why, ye wad no hae them carry 
the dead again the sun; the dead maun aye go wi’ 
the sun,’ . 
This custom is doubtless an ancient British or Celtic 
one, and corresponds with the Highland usage of making 
the deazil, or walking three times round a person 
according to the course of the sun. Old Highlanders 
will still make the deazil around those to whom they ~ 
wish well. To go round the person in the opposite: 
direction, or ‘ withershins,’.is an evil incantation, and’ 
brings ill-fortune. 
It is curious to compare this Yorkshire custom of: 
carrying the dead with the living to the Welsh usage, 
mentioned by Pennant.! Speaking of Skir’og, in North. 
Wales, he says: ‘When a corpse is carried to church 
from any part of the town, the bearers take care to 
carry it, so that the corpse may be on the right hand 
through the way, be it nearer, or be it less trouble to

go on the other side, nor will they bring it through 
any other way than the north gate.” 
It is a Northumbrian belief that three funerals con- 
stantly follow one another in quick succession, an 
opinion to which we may find a parallel in Durham, 
where it is a matter of common remark, that if the 
. cathedral bell tolls once it tolls thrice with little inter- 
mission. A Buckinghamshire variation is to this effect: 
if the clock strikes while the bell is tolling, there will 
be another death within the week. A friend from that 
county informs me also, that whereas it was arule in 
her parish that the bell should only be tolled in the day- 
time, it was once heard by the clergyman at five o’clock 
1 This prejudice oxisted very strongly in Iceland in ancient times. 
According to the Vatnsdocla saga, a woman, by going against the sun 
round a house and waving a cloth, brought down a landslip against the 
house (Vatnsdocla, s. c. 363 ; Landnama, iii. and p. 181). The date of this 
event was about 4.p..990. So a magical storm was laid (Vatns. ¢. 47; 
and also Thorfinn’s 8. Karleefris, c. 9, p. 11; Drop lang an Sonar, 8, p. 
10): ‘The hag did not lie down to sleep that night, she was so restless. 
The weather was cold without, a keen frost, and the sky clear. She 
went several times against the sun round the house, set her face in all 
directions, and turned her nose up. And as she thus went about, the 
weather began to change. There rose a dense fog, and after that an icy 
blast, and an avalanche broke off on the mountain-side, and the snow 
shot down on the farm of Berg, and twelve men died of it, The signs 
of the fall are visible now.’ (Gisla 8, Sarssonar, p. 3.) Again: ‘The 
hag took her knife, and eut on the log runes, and smeared them with 
her blood, and chanted charms over them. Then she went many times 
against the sun round the log, and muttered many troll-like say- 
ings. After that she had the log rolled down to the sea, and she said 
that it would be washed to Drangey, where it would work mischief to 
Grettir’ (Gretta, c. 81.) To go against the sun is ‘andsocles’ in Ice- 
Jandic. I have heard in Yorkshire, that if you walk three times round 
the room against the sun at midnight, and in perfect darkness, and then look in the glass, you will see the devil’s face leering out of it-at you. Again, on All Souls’ Day (I believe), if two people walk round the room 
at midnight, and in darkness, going contrary ways, they will never 
meet; one of the two will have been spirited away.—S.B.G.

PRIEST'S VISIT AFTER A DEATH. 47 
on a winter’s morning, and he accordingly sent to the 
church to have it stopped for two hours. The deceased 
person was a wealthy farmer, and his widow complained 
pitterly over the delay in the tolling. ‘It was so cruel 
in Mr. Y.,’ she said, * to keep the poor soul those hours 
a-waiting!’ Now the ‘passing bell’ was supposed in 
former times to serve two purposes: it called on all 
good Christians within hearing to pray for the departing 
spirit, and it scared away the evil spirits, who were 
watching to seize it, or at least to scare and terrify it. 
Evidently the widow thought that for want of these 
helps the progress of her husband’s soul to its rest was’ 
impeded. 
There is, I am informed, among old-fashioned families 
in Northumberland, a feeling that the death of an 
inmate is a token of the Divine wrath, and that this 
wrath rests on the house until after the visit of the 
parish clergyman, which is therefore anxiously looked 
for and much valued. A friend informs me that he well 
remembers, when a curate in Northumberland, some 
twenty-four years ago, being told by a clergyman of 
that county that he had been frequently asked to ‘bless 
the house’ after a death had taken place in it.

Iz we pass on to days and seasons, we shall find them 
marked in the North by time-honoured customs, unob- 
served for the most part elsewhere. Of course we must 
not look in Scotland for any note of Christmas, but in 
the English border-counties there is much to mark this 
blessed season. Yule-cakes are spread on our tables at 
Christmas-tide, and the yule-log lights up our hearths 
as duly as does the ashen faggot in Devonshire.’ In the 
eity of Durham, and in many other northern towns, an 
old woman carries from house to house, on Christmas 
Eve, figures of the Virgin and Child, and shows them to 
the young people while she sings the old carol,— 
God rest you, merry gentlemen, let nothing you dismay, 
Remember Christ our Saviour was born on Christmas Day, 
‘To save our souls from Satan’s fold, which long had gone astray. 
Aud ’tis tidings of comfort and joy ! 
‘We do not come to your house to beg nor to borrow, 
But we do come to your house, to sing all sorrow away ; 
The merry time of Christmas is drawing very near, 
And ’tis tidings of comfort and joy! 
1 A Devonshire friend informs me of the legend connected with this 
west-country observance. It is said that the Divine Infant at Bethle- 
hem was first washed and dressed by a fire of ashwood.
-P-A-G-E-79
CHRISTMAS USAGES. 49 
‘We do not come to your house to beg for bread and cheese, 
But we do come to your house to give us what you please ; 
The merry time of Christmas is drawing very near, 
And ’tis tidings of comfort and joy! 
God bless the master of this house, the mistress also, 
And all the little children, that round the table go, 
And all their kith and kindred, that travel far and near; 
And we wish you a merry Christmas and a happy New Year! 
Children carry about these figures through the West 
Riding of Yorkshire in what they call milly-boxes, a 
corruption of ‘My Lady.’ The boxes are lined with 
spice, oranges, and sugar. They call this ‘going a 
wassailing.’ 
Later in the evening, the streets of many a Northum- 
brian town (I use the word in its fullest meaning) echo 
the same carol, or the yet finer one ‘Christians awake, 
salute the happy morn!’ In the West Riding the singers 
are dressed in the most fanciful attire, and are called 
‘mummers.’ Throughout the district of Cleveland they 
carry about with them. a ‘bessel cup,’ more properly a 
wassail cup, together with figures of the Virgin and- 
Child, placed in a box, and surrounded with such orna- 
ments as they can collect. To send these singers away 
unrequited is to forfeit good luck for the year. No meat 
is eaten there on Christmas Eve, doubtless because it 
is a fast of the Church; the supper there consists of 
frumety, or wheat boiled in milk, with spice and sugar, 
and of fruit-tarts. At its close the yule-cake and cheese 
are cut and partaken of, while the master taps a fresh 
cask of ale. This cake and cheese are offered through 
the season to every visitor who calls. At Horbury, near 
Wakefield, and at Dewsbury, on Christmas Eve is rung 
the ‘ devil’s knell :’ a hundred strokes, then a pause, then 
three strokes, three strokes, and three strokes again.

But to return to Cleveland. The yule-log (or clog) and 
yule-candles are duly burned there on Christmas Eve, 
the carpenter supplying his customers with the former, 
the grocer with the latter. It would be most unlucky 
to light log or candle before the proper time. The 
whole season has a festive character, and visiting and 
card-playing are kept up throughout it. Christmas- 
boxes, however, are not common in Cleveland. New 
Year’s Day is the time there for making presents, as in 
the eastern counties is St. Thomas’ Day. The poor, 
and especially poor widows, go from house to house on 
this last day, asking for Christmas gifts,. This custom 
prevails also in the West Riding of Yorkshire, where 
the widows ask and commonly receive at the farmers’ 
houses a small measure of wheat, and they call it ‘ going 
a Thomasing,’ . 
St. Stephien’s Day in Cleveland is devoted to hunting 
and shooting, it being held that the game-laws are not 
in force on that day ; but Iam not aware that the apple- 
trees are deliberately aimed at, as is the case in Devon- 
shire, with the view of ensuring a good crop of apples. 
The old custom of hanging up a stocking to receive 
Christmas presents, a custom which the pilgrim-fathers 
carried to America and bequeathed, curiously enough, to 
their descendants, has not yet died out in the North of 
England. - If any of my readers are folk lore collectors, 
they will divine my feelings on discovering in one of our 
‘northern capitals, among my own personal friends, a 
family in which, without the excuse of achild to be sur- 
prised and pleased, each member duly and deliberately 
hangs out her stocking on Christmas Eve to receive the 
kindly gifts of mother and sisters. 
But a Christmas in the North would be quite incom- 
plete without a visit from the sword-dancers, and this
-P-A-G-E-81
THE SWORD-DANCERS. 51 
* may yet be looked for in most of our towns from the 
Humber to the Cheviot Hills. There are some trifling 
local variations both in dance and song: the latter has 
altered with the times; the former is plainly a relic of 
the war-dances of our Danish and Saxon ancestors. Thad 
an opportunity last spring of making enquiries into the 
mysteries of sword-dancing from a pitman of Houghton 
Colliery, Houghton-le-Spring, Joseph Brown by name, 
and will simply relate what I heard from him on the 
subject. He was well qualified to speak, having acted 
as sword-dancer during the past twelve years, in com- 
pany with eight other men, nine being the number 
always employed. Five are dancers, one a clothes- 
carrier, two clowns, and one a fiddler. 
There are two sets of verses used near Durham, termed 
the old and new styles. The old verses are certainly 
of the date of a hundred years back; they were always 
used till about ten years ago, and are still sung in turn 
with the modern ones. They are as follows :— 
First Clown: It’s a ramblin’ here I’ve ta’en 
The country for to see, 
Five actors I have brought, 
~ Yet better cannot be. 
Now, my actors they are young, 
And they’ve ne’er been out before, 
But they ’ll do the best they can, 
And the best can do no more. 
Now the first that I call on 
Is George, our noble king ; 
Long time he’s been at wars, 
Good tidings back he ’Il bring. 
One of the sword-dancers here steps from the ring, in 
which all had been standing, and follows the first clown, 
holding his sword upright as he walks round the outside 
of the ring ; and the first clown then sings: 
RQ

carrying with them an image of a white horse. This 
white horse appears at Christmas throughout the North 
of Germany, with the ‘ Hale Christ,’ ‘Knecht Rupert, 
or ‘San Claus,’ who brings the good children presents, 
but punishes the naughty ones. 
In the midland counties, people asking for Christmas- 
boxes on Christmas Eve drag about with them a horse’s 
head and ski. I have seen this myself in the Forest of 
Dean. Mr. Baring Gould writes on the subject: ‘At 
Wakefield and Stanby the mummers enter a house, and 
if it be in a foul state they proceed to sweep the hearth, 
and clean the kitchen-range, humming all the time 
“mum-m-m.” At Horbury they do no sweeping now, 
though I believe in old times they used to practise it. 
As far as I can judge, there is generally one man in 
sailor’s dress, the rest. being women, or rather men in 
women’s dress, but this is not universal. The Christ- 
mas-tup is another amusement. It is distinct from the 
white horse. I believe that the Christmas mummers 
represent the yule host, or wild hunt, and that the man 
of the party is Wodin or Odin. The horse is evidently 
the white steed, Gleipmir, of the ancient god.’ 
New Year’s Eve is one of the nights on which it is 
deemed highly unlucky in the Borders to let the fire 
out, the others being Ali Hallowe’en, Beltane or Mid- 
summer Eve, and Christmas Eve. It is not easy to 
repair the mischief if once committed, for no one is 
willing on the following morning to give his neighbour 
alight, lest he should thus give away all his good luck 
for the season. . And he who should steal. fire unseen 
from his neighbour’s hearth, would fare no better for it, 
since fire thus taken is not counted holy. 
It is curious to compare this statement of Mr. 
Wilkie with that given by Mr. Kelly respecting the
-P-A-G-E-83
NEW. YEAR'S EVE. 55 
© holy fires of the Germanic race,’ in his ‘ Indo-European 
Traditions and Folk Lore’ (page 46). Mr. Kelly enu- 
merates the Easter fires with those on St. John’s Day, 
Michaelmas, Martinmas, and Christmas. It will be 
observed that in Scotland the Easter, Michaelmas, and 
Martinmas fires disappear, while that of All Hallowe’en 
takes their place. And while in Scotland all care is 
taken to preserve the house-fire alight at these hallowed 
seasons, it has been the usage in Germany, and earlier 
still throughout all Christendom, to extinguish it, and 
relight it with holy fire, kindled by the priest with flint 
and steel in the churchyard. 
Empty pockets or an empty cupboard on New Year’s 
Eve portend a year of poverty. The poet Burns makes 
mention of this in an epistle to Colonel de Payster, from 
whom he borrowed a small sum at this season : 
To make the old year go out groaning, 
And keep the new year from coming in moaning. 
Indeed, in the Borders care is taken that no one enters ' 
a house empty-handed on New Year’s Day. A visitor 
will be doubly welcome if he carries in a hot stoup or 
‘plotie” Everybody should wear a new dress on New 
Year’s Day, and if its pockets contain money of every 
description, they will be certain not to be empty 
throughout the year. The last glass of wine or spirits 
drained from the last bottle on New Year's Eve or Day is 
called the ‘lucky glass.” It brings good fortune to who- 
ever comes in for it, and if an unmarried person drinks 
it, be will be the first to marry among the company. 
You must take note what is the Christian name of the 
first person you see of the opposite sex on New Year's 
Day: it will be that of the future husband or wife. 
On New Year’s Day much importance is attached to

the first foot which crosses the threshold. That of a 
fair man is luckier than of a dark one, but (alas for 
the chivalry of the North!) should it be a woman’s, 
some misfortune may certainly be looked for. The 
servant-girls are desirous that their ‘first-foot’ should 
be a lover, and sometimes they ensure it by admitting 
him as soon as the New Year isrungin. “They arrange, 
too, that he should bring something with him into the 
house, for, as the Lincolnshire rhyme runs :— 
Take out, and then take in, 
Bad luck will begin ; 
Take in, then take out, 
Good luck comes about. 
A friend tells me, that in the western part of the 
county of Durham he has known a man to be specially 
retained ag ‘first-foot,’ his guerdon being a glass of 
spirits, but it was not necessary that he should be a 
bachelor. The man took care to be at the house by 
5 o’clock in the morning, which ensured his being the 
earliest visitor. This custom prevails through all our 
northern counties, At Stamfordham, in Northumber- 
land, the first-foot must be a bachelor. He generally 
brings in a shovelful of coals, but, unfortunately, whisky 
is coming into fashion as his offering. One inhabitant 
of the village, I. scarcely know why, was considered a 
lucky ‘first-foot,’ and he always went in that capacity 
to the blacksmith’s house hard by, One year some one 
else was, by accident, first-foot. This was considered 
an ill omen, and accordingly, during the following hay- 
harvest, the house was broken open and haif-a~sove- 
reign stolen.! 
1 This holds good of the West Riding of Yorkshire. Doors are there 
chained up to prevent females from entering. A man in the town comes 
early to —~ Parsonage, and bids the maids unbar and let him in, as he 
brings the new year to them.
-P-A-G-E-85
NEW YEAR’S EVE. - 57 
It is recorded by Hospinian that formerly, in Rome, no 
one would suffer another to take fire out of his house on 
New Year’s Day, or anything made of iron, or indeed 
would lend anything! But I can bear witness that 
this idea has been more thoroughly worked out in the 
farmhouses of this county. It happened that, when a 
boy, I spent Christmas in one of those primitive se- 
cluded spots, which now, alas! have disappeared before 
the collieries which crowd and darken the land. I re- 
member accompanying the mistress of the house to 
her kitchen on New Year’s Eve, when she called 
together all her servants, and warned them, under pain 
of dismissal, not to allow anything to be carried out of 
the house on the following day, though they might 
bring in as much as they pleased. Acting on this 
order, all ashes, dish-wasbings, or potato-parings, and so 
forth, were retained in the house till the next day; 
while coals, potatoes, firewood, and bread were brought 
in as usual, the mistress keeping a sharp look-out on 
the fulfilment of her orders. 
Now, we may see in this practice on the first day of 
the year, a shadow of anxiety that the incomings of 
the ensuing twelvemonth should exceed the outgoings, 
or in other words that the year might be prosperous. 
Much of our folk lore points to this craving for material 
prosperity: ¢g., the keeping the tip of a dried tongue in 
the pocket, that it may never be empty; or turning 
the money in it on the first sight of the New Moon, or 
on first hearing the note of the cuckoo, to ensure there 
being always plenty there—— practices still common 
among us.?

The Cleveland New Year’s greeting is very definite 
on this matter :-—~ 
I wish you a merry Christmas, 
And a happy New Year, 
A pantry full of roast beef, 
And a barrel full of beer. 
You may constantly hear the lads of that district 
calling it through their neighbours’ keyholes early on 
New Year’s morning. It is also recited by the children 
of the West Riding, when they make their rounds 
soliciting New Year’s gifts. ‘ 
Old people are careful to note how the wind blows 
on New Year’s Eve, as they think it significant of the 
weather during the following season, according to the 
old rhymes :— 
If New Year's Eve night wind blow south, 
It betokeneth warmth and growth ; 
If west, much milk, and fish in the sea; 
If north, much cold and storms there will be ; 
If east, the trees will bear much fruit ; 
If north-east, flee it, man and brute. 
Perhaps I may mention here two other weather 
prophecies. It is well known that ‘a green-yule makes 
a fat kirk-yard,’ but the following couplet is of narrower 
circulation. It was communicated to me by a friend, 
who assures me that it is current in Buckinghamshire :— 
If the calends of January be smiling and gay, 
You ’ll have wintry weather till the calends of May. 
It is curious to find that the word ‘calends’ still 
lives on the lips of the English peasantry. What idea 
it conveys to their minds I will not enquire. There 
is an old rhyme yet current which avers: 
If the sun shine out of Candlemas-day, of all days in the year, 
The shepherd had rather see his wife on the bier;
-P-A-G-E-87
NEW YEAR’S DAY. 59 
which corresponds with the Latin proverb— 
Si sol splendescat Maria purificante, 
Major erit glacies post festum quam fuit ante. 
The oak and ash, both sacred trees, and the ash in 
particular, the cloud-tree of the Norsemen, with sacred 
fountains springing from every root, supply a weather 
prophecy to this day. If the oak comes into leaf 
before the ash, expect a fine summer; if the ash is first, 
a wet one; or, as it runs in verse: 
If the oak’s before the ash, 
‘You will only get a splash ; 
If the ash precede the oak, 
‘You will surely have a soak, 
It is customary in Scotland for children to go to the 
neighbouring houses on New Year’s Day, singing this 
verse; 
Rise, good wives, and shake your feathers, 
And dinna think that we are beggars ; 
We’re but bairns come out to play, 
Rise up and gie’s your hogmaney, 
Oat-cakes are given to them, on which they sing: 
We joyful wish you a good day, 
And thank ye for your hogmaney. 
Now here we come upon a custom of great antiquity, 
and very widely spread, if, as Mr. Ingledew informs us 
in his ‘ Ballads and Songs of Yorkshire,” Hagmena 
songs were formerly sung throughout England, Scot- 
land, and France. He gives a fragment of that in use 
at_ Richmond, in Yorkshire: 
Tonight it is the New Year's night, to-morrow is the day, 
And we are come for our right and for our ray, 
As we used to do in old King Henry’s day. 
Sing, fellows, sing Hagman heigh!

If you go to the black ark, bring me ten mark, 
Ten mark, ten pound, throw it down upon the ground, 
That I and my merry men may have some. 
Sing, fellows, sing Hagman heigh! 
The dole of cakes causes New Year’s Day to be 
called ‘cake day’ on the Scottish borders, and the 
following Monday. is known as Hansel Monday, because 
of the presents of money made on that day, and placed 
in the receiver’s hands. It is named in the old formula 
of good wishes, ‘A happy New Year and a merry 
Hansel Monday.’ Scholars commonly give a hansel 
to their master or mistress on this day. The boy who 
gives the largest sum is called the King, and the girl 
the Queen, and the King claims the right of demanding 
at least that day as a holiday. 
Shrove Tuesday, like Lent, passes unnoticed in 
Scotland. In the villages of the West Riding, the 
streets may be seen on this day full of grown-up men 
and women, playing ‘battledore and shuttle feathers.’ 
The use of palms on Palm Sunday has, I fear, 
passed away, except among Roman Catholics. The late 
Mr. Denham, however, in one of his tracts, printed in 
1858, speaks of palm-crosses as relics still often to be 
. Seen in the hands of north-country children on Palm 
Sunday, and on cottage-walls through the rest of the 
year. And he quotes the proverb as still in use, ‘He 
that hath not a palm in his hand on Palm Sunday 
must have his hand cut off.’ The Rev. G. Ornsby also 
tells me that when he was a child palm-crosses were
-P-A-G-E-89

always made for Palm Sunday, by the people in the 
Vale of Lanchester. The substitute for palm was the 
willow with its early catkins, which formed the extremi- 
ties of the arms of the cross; they were tied together 
with blue or pink ribbon, disposed with bows here and 
there, and were often very tasteful and pretty. And I’ 
can myself bear witness to their constant use in the 
city of Durham, about forty years ago. Many a time 
have I, when a boy, walked with my comrades to the 
river-bank, near Kepier Hospital, to gather palms ; and 
many a cross have I made of them for Palm Sunday. 
We formed them like a St. Andrew’s Cross, with a tuft 
of catkins at each point, and bound them up with knots 
and bows of ribbon. In Yorkshire, children mark the 
day differently; they get ‘pawne bottles,’ 4. ¢. bottles 
containing a little sugar, and betake themselves to the 
springs and wells, to fill their bottles, and suck at them 
all the afternoon. . 
To pass on to Good Friday.. The Incumbent of Fish- 
lake, a village in the south-east of Yorkshire, tells me 
that in that place, on Good Friday morning, at eight 
o’clock, instead of the usual bell being rung as on 
Sundays and other holydays, to give notice of Morning 
Services the great bell of the church is solemnly tolled 
as fora death or funeral, This custom is very beautiful 
and suggestive, but I do not remember to have heard 
of it elsewhere. A friend’ who passed his boyhood in 
the north of Durham informs me that no blacksmith 
throughout that district would then drive a nail on that 
day; a remembrance of the awful purpose for which 
hammer and nails were used on the first Good Friday 
doubtless held them back. 
I learn from a clergyman familiar with the North 
Riding of Yorkshire, that great care is there taken not

to disturb the earth in any way; it were impious to 
use spade, plough, or harrow. He remembers, when a 
boy, hearing of a villager, Charlie Marston by name, 
who shocked his neighbours by planting potatoes on 
Good Friday, but they never came up. 
The popular feeling in Devonshire is very different. 
The poor there like to plant crops on Good Friday, 
especially to sow peas, saying they are sure to grow 
‘goody,’ and it is thought a very lucky day for graft- 
- ing. A distinctive observance of Good Friday seems, 
however, to have once prevailed in that county, and so 
singular a one, that I trust its mention may not be 
deemed irrelevant. The rector of a country parish 
about fourteen miles from Exeter was startled one day 
by this enquiry, from a Sunday scholar, ‘ Please, Sir, 
why do people break clomb (4.¢. crockery) on Good 
Friday? The question was rather puzzling to the 
rector, but he was a good deal struck by hearing after- 
wards that it is the custom in the island of Corfu, for 
' the inhabitants on that day to fling potsherds down a 
steep rock, uttering imprécations on the traitor Judas. 
An old woman of the North Riding once asked a 
friend of mine whether it was wrong to wash on Good 
Friday. ‘I used to do so,’ she said, ‘and thonght no 
harm of it, till once, when I was hanging out my clothes, 
a young woman passed by (a dressmaker she was, and a 
Methodist); and she reproved me, and told me this 
story. While our Lord Jesus was being led to Calvary, 
they took him past a woman who was washing, and the 
woman “ blirted” the thing she was washing in His face ; 
on which He said, “Cursed be every one who hereafter 
shall wash on this day!” And never again,’ added the 
old woman, ‘ have I washed on Good Friday.’ 
Now it is said, in Cleveland, that clothes washed and

hung out to dry-on Good Friday will become spotted 
with blood ; but the Methodist girl’s wild legend reminds 
me more of one which a relation of mine elicited from 
a poor Devonshire shoemaker. She-was remonstrating 
with him for bis indolence and want of spirit, when he 
astonished her by replying, ‘Dont’ee be hard on me. 
We shoemakers are a poor slobbering race, and so have 
been ever since the curse that Jesus Christ) laid on us.’ 
«And what was that?’ she asked. ‘Why,’ said he, 
‘when they were carrying Him to the cross, they 
passed a shoemaker’s bench, and the man looked up and 
spat at Him; and the Lord turned and said, “A poor 
slobbering fellow shalt thou be, and all shoemakers after 
thee,! for what thou hast done to Me.”’ 
All England over it is commonly said that one must 
put on something new on Easter Sunday, else the birds 
will spoil one’s clothes, or, as it stands in verse— 
At Easter let your clothes be new, 
Or else, be sure, you will it rue. 
The belief that the sun dances at its rising on Easter 
morning peeps out in many parts of Yorkshire, as well 
as in Durham and Northumberland. Here, again, there 
isa singular correspondence between the folk lore of the 
North and the West. Devonshire maidens get up to see 
the sun rise on Easter morning, as duly as do their 
northern sisters, though what they look for is the Lamb 
and flag in the centre of the sun’s disc. Poor women in 
the neighbourhood of Dartmoor have told me that they 
used, as girls, to go out in parties at sunrise to see the

Jew, Cartaphilus or Ahasuerus, whichever was his name, having been a 
shoemaker, and cursed, it is said, by Our Lord, for refusing to allow Him 
to rest on the doorstep of his shop.—S. B. G. .

Lamb in the sun, and look at it through a darkened 
glass, and some always declared they saw it. . 
As to Easter eggs, they are as duly painted and gilded 
and rolled on the greensward, throughout the North of 
England, as they are in Russia or Germany. I am told, 
however, that the West Riding forms an exception ; pasch 
eggs are unknown there. Another Eastern custom, and 
one, perhaps, better honoured in the breach than the ob- 
servance, came before me this year. In a Sunday- 
school at Durham, a scanty attendance of girls on Eas- 
ter Day, was accounted for by their being ‘terrified’ lest 
the boys should ‘pull off their shoes. ‘To-morrow,’ it 
was added, ‘they may pull off the boys’ caps.’ . This 
frolic, whatever be its origin, seems to have extended 
into Yorkshire. At least, a friend tells me that she re- 
members, when a little girl, having her shoes pulled off 
one Easter on the sands at Redcar; and I have heard 
.of a stout-hearted Yorkshire curate, who used to go 
round his parish on Easter Sunday afternoon, to collect 
the girls, and pioneer them safely to church and school. 
That was the time of danger, for the young men had no 
right to take their shoes till after Morning Service. I 
may add that in the West Riding ‘luking’ (playing 
at knurr and spill) begins at Easter.) . 
* In Lancashire, it is customary for the lasses on Easter Monday to 
‘heave * the lads, i.e, to lift them up from the ground in their arms. On 
Tuesday the lads heave the lasses. 
A friend of mine, a native of Warrington, tells me that Her Majesty's 
Inspector of Schools took it into his head to visit Warrington on Monday 
in Easter week. The lasses, seeing a timorous spectacled parson walking 
down the street, with one accord heaved him, and carried him in their 
arms through the town. My informant declares that the terror and 
agony of the poor Inspector were something awful. The more he strug- 
gled the closer he was hugged, while an occasional smack from the lips 
of a vigorous mill-girl blanched his cheek, and made his rumpled hair 
stand on end. He firmly believed that his character and position were

CHIPPING THE BLOCK. 65. 
Before passing on from Easter observances, let me 
mention one old custom still kept up at University Col- 
lege, Oxford, the most ancient college, I believe, in the 
University. A block, in the form of a long wooden pole 
decorated with flowers and evergreens, is placed outside 
the door of the Hall, leaning against the wall of the 
buttery which is opposite. After dinner on Easter Day, 
the cook and his attendant, dressed in white paper caps 
and white jackets, take their stand on either side of the 
block, each bearing a pewter dish, one supporting a blunt 
chopping-axe from the kitchen, the other in ‘Teadiness 
for the fees expected on the occasion. As the members 
of the college come out of the hall-—first the master, then 
the fellows, and so on—each takes the axe, strikes. the 
block with it, and then places in the proper dish the 
usual fee to the cook. This rite is called ‘chipping the 
block ;’ its origin is unexplained. The tradition among 
the undergraduates is, that anyone who can chip the 
block in two (under the circumstances a physical impos- 
sibility), can lay claim to all the college estates, but the 
master and fellows dispute this. 
Ascension Day appears unmarked in the North by any 
peculiar observances. I only learn that near York it 
was the custom, twenty years ago, for children to lay 
rushés or ‘ seggs’ on their doorsteps to mark the festival. 
The Rev. G. Ornsby suggests that this has probably 
arisen from the streets having been thus strewn before 
the procession on this festival in pre-Reformation times. 
He was once at Cologne on Ascension Day, and witnessed 
irretrievably ruined. On another Easter Monday, one of my friends was. 
lifted and kissed tilihe was black in the face, by a party of leather- 
breeched coalpit women, at, I think, Wednesbury. The same custom 
prevails in the Pyrenees, where I have been lifted by a party of stout 
Basque damsels—8. B. G.

a most imposing procession, and the streets were all 
strewn previously with short twigs of fir-branches and 
other green things. 
But our most characteristic festive rejoicings accom- 
pany the harvest—the mell-supper and the kern-baby, 
usages which are by no means extinct among us. In the 
northern part of Northumberland, the festival takes place 
at the end of the reaping, not of the ingathering; and 
an essay written, about the year 1750, by the unhappy 
Eugene Aram, states that such was also the case in York-~ 
shire. When the sickle is laid down, and the last sheaf 
of golden corn set on end, it is said that they have ‘ got 
the kern.’ The reapers announce the fact by loud shout- 
ing, and an image is at once hoisted ona pole, and given 
into the charge of the tallest and strongest man of the 
party. The image is crowned with wheat ears and 
dressed up in gay finery, a white frock and coloured 
ribbons being its conventional attire.’ The whole group 
circle round this harvest-queen, or kern-baby, curtseying 
to her, and dancing and singing; and thus they proceed 
to the farmer’s barn, where they set the image up on 
high, as the presiding goddess of their revels, and pro- 
eeed to do justice to the harvest-supper. 
_ Nor is this all.’ Each cottage must at harvest-time 
have its own household divinity, and oaten cakes having 
formerly been the staple food of the North, these figures 
are commonly formed of oats. Such have I repeatedly 
seen in cottages on the Tweed side, elaborately decorated 
and enshrined at the top of the bink or dresser, with the 
family stock of big dishes ranged on either side. These, 
too, are kern-babies. There has been some controversy 
as to the derivation of the word‘ kern.’ To me it clearly 
seems to mean corn. I may mention, in support of this 
opinion, that in Cornwall an ill-saved harvest is said to
-P-A-G-E-95
THE MELL-SUPPER. 67 
be ‘ill kerned,’ and that throughout Devonshire the’ 
forming of the grain in the ear is called the ‘ kerning’ 
or ‘corning.’ . 
Themell-supper takes its name from the Norse‘ mele,’ 
corn. In Icelandic, ‘melr’ is the Psamma-arenario, the 
wild corn of the sand-flats: melr also signifies sandy 
land. Both are derived from the same root, which 
means to grind to dust. It has come to be applied to 
corn because it can be made into meal—to sand, because 
it is pounded stone. As kept up till lately in my own 
county, the mell-supper is closely akin to the Northum- 
brian kern-feast. Iam not too old to have taken part 
in more than one of them, and most thoroughly did I 
enjoy them. My recollection of a mell-doll is of a corn- 
sheaf stuck with flowers, and wrapped in such of the 
reapers’ garments as could be spared. This, too, was 
carried to the scene of the harvest-supper amid music 
and dancing, and then master and servants sat down to- 
gether to feast, on terms of perfect equality. 
This feature of harvest festivities is common to all 
the northern districts, and springs from a grateful sensé 
of the reaper’s services at a peculiarly anxious time; 
but one part of the entertainment I connect especially 
with my own county. I well remember, not far from 
its cathedral town, helping to dress some young men 
who were to play the part of ‘ guisers,’ and force their 
entrance into a mell-supper. Disguised they most 
effectually were—covered with masks, or blackened 
with burnt cork past’ all recognition, and their dress 
the gayest motley imaginable. In apprehension of 
such invaders, the doors and windows of the barn or 
dancing-room were barricaded, and the whole building 
placed in a state of defence; but, whether through 
treachery within-doors, or their own unassisted valour, 
FQ

the guisers did at last effect an entrance, and claimed 
the privilege of conquerors. 
Such scenes I often witnessed in my young days, and 
such I believe still to be enacted in many north-country 
farmhouses; but who among the groups that dance be- 
fore the kern-baby, deem that they are treading in the 
-steps of their old British ancestors, as, taught by their 
Roman conquerors, they danced and bowed before the 
goddess Ceres? Or, again, of those who ata later period 
in history paid the same votive honours to the Virgin 
Mary ? Or who, as they sit at the mell-supper, master 
and servant on equal terms, imagine that their festival 
had its origin, it may be, in the Jewish Feast of Taber- 
nacles—it may be, in the Roman Saturnalia? ‘Thou 
shalt observe the feast of tabernacles seven days, after 
that thou hast gathered in thy corn and thy wine: and 
thou shalt rejoice in thy feast, thou, and thy son, and 
thy daughter, and thy manservant, and thy maidser- 
vant, and the Levite, the stranger, and the fatherless, 
and the widow, that are within thy gates.”! 
A friend from Yorkshire tells me that the mell-doll 
is now unknown in the north of that county, but with 
mell-suppers and guisers he is quite familiar. The York- 
shire custom is, that when in any farm the harvest: is 
won, one of the reapers should mount a wall or bank, and 
proclaim as follows: 
Blest be the day when Christ was born, 
We've getten mell of (—’s) corn, 
Weel bun and better shorn. 
Huzza! huzza! huzza! 
—everyone then joining in the general cheer.? 
1 Deut. xvi. 13, 14. 
% Through Devonshire the reapers leave a bunch of corn, which they 
call a neck, to be afterwards tied up with ribbons and flowers, and hung 
in the barn. And they approach it, saying, as they cut each line of corn,

THE MELL-SUPPER. 69 
In Cleveland, the mell-supper is still kept up, though 
with less’ ceremony than formerly. ‘Guising’ was 
practised there thirty years ago, but is now discontinued. 
On forking the last sheaf in the harvest-field they shout 
in chorus: 
Weel bun and better shorn, 
Is Master (—'s) corn ; 
We hev her, we hey her, 
As fast as a feather. 
Hip, hip, hurrah ! 
In the neighbourhood of Fishlake, in the West 
Riding, neither mell-doll nor mell-supper now prevail. 
Among minor festivals, St. Agnes’ Day is marked in 
our northern counties by a superstitious observance of 
its own, called St. Agnes’ Fast, the same which has fur- 
nished Keats with a subject for his little poem, ‘The 
Eve of St. Agnes.’ He recounts, in his own glowing yet 
chastened style, how all the wintry day Madeline’s 
heart had brooded 
On love, and winged St. Agnes’ saintly care, 
As she had heard old dames full many times declare. 
“Wee day, weeday!’ When the neck is cut, there is shouting and halloing, 
and the reapers call out— 
We have ploughed, we have sowed, 
We have reaped, we have mowed, 
We have brought home every load, 
With a Hip, hip, hip, hurrah ! 
Compare with these harvest customs those of Schaumburg-Lippe. 
When barley was cut there a tuft was left called ‘ Waul roggen.’ In this 
was placed a stick adorned with flowers, called the ‘ Waul staff ;’ and then 
the reapers bowed to it with hats off, shouting together thrice, ‘Waul, 
waul, waul!’ Waul is a corruption of waud-wod, that: is to say, Wustan 
or Woden, In like manner is @ changed into Z in the two German 
dialects—as, for instance, melecin for medecin, The Groek Sdxpv=lacrima, 
the Sanskrit madhu, in Latin is mel. Wee-day is also a corruption of 
‘Wustan or Woden.—8. B. G,

They told her how, upon St. Agnes’ Eve, 
Young virgins might have visions of delight, 
And soft advisings from their loves receive, 
Upon the honeyed middle of the night, 
If ceremonies due they did aright; 
As supperless to bed they must retire, 
And couch supine their beauties, lily white ; 
Nor look behind, nor sideways, but require, 
Of Heaven, with upward eyes, for all that they desire. 
St. Agnes’ Fast is thus practised throughout Durham 
and Yorkshire. Two young girls, each desirous to 
dream about their future husbands, must abstain through 
the whole of St. Agnes’ Eve from eating, drinking, or 
speaking, and must avoid even touching their lips with 
their fingers. At night they are to make together their 
‘dumb cake,’ so called from the rigid silence which 
attends its manufacture. Its ingredients (flour, salt, 
water, &e.) must be supplied in equal proportions by 
their friends, who must also take equal shares in the 
baking and turning of the cake, and in drawing it out * 
of the oven. The mystic viand must next be divided 
into two equal portions, and each girl, taking her share, 
is to carry it upstairs, walking backwards all the time, 
and finally eat it and. jump into bed. A damsel who 
duly fulfils all these conditions, and has also kept her 
thoughts all the day fixed on her ideal of a husband, 
may confidently expect to see her future partner in her 
dreams. 
The prescribed formula is somewhat different in 
Northumberland. There a number of girls, after a 
day’s silence and fasting, will boil eggs, one apiece, 
extract the yolk, fill the cavity with salt, and eat the 
egg, shell and all, and then walk backwards, uttering 
this invocation to the saint:
-P-A-G-E-99
ST. AGNES’ FAST. qi 
Sweet St. Agnes, work thy fast, 
If ever J be to marry man, 
Or man be to marry me, 
T hope him this night to see. 
Or, 
Fair St. Agnes, play thy part, 
And send to me my own sweetheart, 
Not in his best or worst array, 
But in the clothes of every day, 
That to-morrow I may him ken, 
From amoug all other men. 
A raw red herring, swallowed bones and all, is said to 
be equally efficacious, and doubtless is very provocative 
of dreams and visions. Northumbrian swains some~ 
times adopt this plan to get a glimpse of their future 
wives. 
A Yorkshire friend mentions another way in which 
St. Agnes’ Fast might be broken, and the success of the 
charm utterly ruined—that is, by a kiss; and it was a 
constant trick of the young wags to come unawares 
upon a girl who was believed to be keeping St. Agnes’ 
Fast, and break her fast by a salute. 
We learn from the Wilkie MS. that the Second of 
April shares on the Borders the character which the 
First bears all England over. There are two April-fool 
days there, or, as they call them, ‘ gowk days.’ Unsus- 
pecting people are then sent on bootless errands, and 
ridiculed for their pains. One such day has, I believe, 
always sufficed us in England. To the full observance 
of this day in my native city, at the time of my boy- 
hood, I can bear witness; having been duly sent, with 
many another urchin, to the chemist for a pennyworth 
of oil of hazel, and received it in another way than I 
looked for, from the stout. hazel-stick hidden behind the 
shopman’s counter. Sometimes the victim is instructed
-P-A-G-E-100

to ask for ‘strap oil.’ This custom extends to Germany : 
in Berlin ‘crab’s blood’ or ‘ gnat’s fat’ are the articles 
sent for. 
But ‘ hunting the gowk’ is more fully carried out by 
sending the victim from place to place with a letter, in 
which the following couplet was written: 
The first and second of Aprile, 
Hound the gowk another mile. 
I need hardly add that gowk is a local name for the 
cuckoo, of which bird our ancestors said : 
In April He opes his bill, 
Now, according to White of Selborne, the 7th of 
April is the earliest day for hearing the cuckoo, the 
26th the latest. Therefore, before the change of style, 
the lst and 2nd of the month, now the 12th and 13th, 
were days on which it would probably be heard for the 
first time. In Sussex, April 14 is called ¢ first cuckoo’ 
day.’ Verses about this bird abound through our whole 
island, and many portents are drawn from it. In many 
places children say: 
Cuckoo, cherry trea, 
Good bird, tell me 
How many years before I dee? 
and listen for an answer in the repetitions of the bird’s 
cry. In Sweden the question is, ‘In how many years 
shall I be married?’ Itis considered lucky in Scotland 
to be walking when one first hears the cuckoo : 
Gang and hear the gowk yell, 
Si and see the swallow flee, 
See the foal before its mother’s ’ee, 
*T will a thriving year wi’ thee. 
But it is unlucky to have no money in your pocket, and
-P-A-G-E-101
ST. VALENTINE’S EVE, 73 
you must without fail turn the money when you hear 
the bird for the first time in the season. 
St. Valentine’s Eve has an observance of its own in 
the South of Scotland. The young people assemble and 
write the names of their acquaintances on slips of paper, 
placing those of the lads and lassies in separate bags 
apart. The maidens draw from the former, the young 
men from the latter, three times in succession, returning 
the names after the first and second times of drawing. 
If one person takes out the same name three times con- 
secutively, it is without fail that of the future husband 
or wife. Thus, in Burns’ song of ‘Tam Glen, the 
maiden sings: 
Yestreen at the Valentine dealing, 
My heart to my mou gi’ed a sten, 
For thrice I drew ane without failing, 
An’ thrice it was written, Tam Glen. 
In a Buckinghamshire village, to the present day, a 
young person will address the .first person he or she 
meets of the opposite sex with these words: 
Good morrow to you, Valentine, 
First ’tis yours and then ’tis mine, 
T'll thank you for a, Valentine. 
Old people presage the weather of the coming season 
by that of the last three days of March, which they call 
the * borrowing days,’ and thus rhyme about: 
March borrowed from April 
Three days, and they were ill; 
The first o’ them war wind an’ weet, 
The next o’ them war snaw an’ slect, 
* The last o’ them war wind an’ rain, 
Which gaed the silly pair ewes come toddling hame,

But lend your first three days to me, 
And [ll be bound to gar them dee.

The next it sall be snaw an’ sleet, 
The third it sall be sic a freeze, 
Sall gar the birds stick to the trees. 
But when the borrowed days were gane, 
‘The three silly hogs came hirplin’ hame. 
It is curious that in the country parts of Devonshire 
the same three days are called’ * blind days, and con- 
sidered unlucky for sowing any kind of seed. And it is 
yet more remarkable that the Highlanders have their 
borrowed or borrowing days, but with them February 
borrows from January, and bribes him with three young 
sheep. These first three days of February, or Faiolteach, 
by Highland reckoning (that is, old style), occur 
between February 11 and 15. And it is accounted 
a most favourable prognostic for the ensuing year 
that they should be stormy and cold.! Can it be 
that this belief has any connection with the three cold 
days in February, mentioned by Humboldt, in his 
* Cosmos,’ as confirmatory of his theory respecting the 
November stream of aérolites ? 
The 29th of May is marked in Fishlake and its 
neighbourhood as the close of the birds’-nesting season. 
The boys think it unlucky to take nests later, and 
religiously abstain from doing so. 
There is an old saying in the North about St. Michael’s 
Day: ‘So many days old the moon is on Michaelmas 
Day, so many floods after.’ I am not aware that the 
Trish custom of abstaining from blackberries after 
this day extends to the North of England, but I have

come across it in Devonshire. The saying in Ireland 
is this: ‘ At Michaelmas the devil puts his foot on the 
blackberries.’ In Yorkshire, this festival is called 
‘hipping day,’ from its connection with a confection of 
hips, the red berries of the wild rose. 
How All-Hallowe’en is kept in Scotland, English 
readers well know from Burns’ poem on the subject. It 
is an evening of mirth and hilarity, and many divina- 
tions into futurity take place during its mystic hours. 
The Wilkie MS. mentions some of these which are not 
named by Burns, but as they may also be practised on 
the eves of Christmas, New Year’s Day, and Midsummer 
Day, they will be more properly ranged under the head 
of ¢ Divinations into Futurity” Ordeal by fire and water 
are, however, peculiarly Hallowe’en sports. The latter 
consists in ducking for an apple in a tub of water with 
the mouth, the hands being clasped behind the back. 
In the former, a small rod of wood is suspended from 
the ceiling, with a lighted candle fixed at one end, and 
an apple at the other. The stick is twirled round, and 
the company in turn try to catch the apple in their 
teeth, at the moment it passes before them. These 
sports are still practised in the neighbourhood of . 
Durham. 
Another fiery ordeal consists in whirling before the 
face a lighted brand, singing the old verse,— 
Dingle, dingle, dowsie, the cat’s in the well ; 
The dog ’s awa’ to Berwick, to buy a new bell. 
They then observe the last sparks of fire, and augur 
from them : many round spots mean money, a quick 
extinction loss of property, and so on.!

St. Clement’s Day was formerly observed, in the North

but they only ask for apples, which are generally given 
them. 
At the risk of being deemed discursive, I cannot 
refrain from mentioning a Buckinghamshire custom, 
communicated to me by a friend. It was once univer- 
sal among the lacemakers of that county, but is fast 
becoming obsolete. St. Andrew is there considered the 
patron saint of lacemaking, possibly because the in- 
tersecting threads in their delicate fabric so frequently 
form his cross; at any rate, his day is kept as a festi- 
val by all who practise that handicraft. The cakes 
made in honour of it are called ‘T’andry cakes,’ a 
curious corruption of St. Andrew. Though this saint 
be the patron of Scotland, his day is now little heeded 
there. It was formerly kept by repasts of sheeps’ heads, 
the old national dish, and the day was called Andermes. 
however, the cake is eaten several days before the 5th, I have no doubt 
it originally formed part of the All-hallows’ feast. The Sunday within 
the octave of All Saints is called Parkin Sunday.—S. B. G.

Tus Borderland is peculiarly rich in ways and means 
for getting a peep into futurity, especially as regards 
the all-important point of the future partner in wedded 
life. Some of these may be practised at any time, but 
most are restricted to All-Hallowe’en, Christmas Eve, 
New Year’s Eve, and Beltane or Midsummer Eve. 
The following rite seems of the former class. Let 
a youth or maiden pull from its stalk the flower of the 
‘horse-knot’ or ‘primula,’ cut the tops of the stamens 
with a pair of scissors, and lay the flower by in a secret 
place, where no human eye can see it. Let him think 
through the day, and dream through the night, of his 
sweetheart, and then, on looking at it the next day, if 
he find the stamens shot out to their former height, 
success will attend him in love; if not, he can only 
expect disappointment.! 
The next rite, however, is restricted to the above- 
named eves. Let a Border maiden take three pails full of -

water, and place them on her bedroom floor; then pin 
to her night-dress, opposite to her heart, three leaves of 
green holly, and so retire to rest. She will be roused 
from her first sleep by three yells, as if from the throats 
of three bears: as these sounds die away, they will be suc- 
ceeded by as many hoarse laughs, after which the form 
of her future husband will appear. If he is deeply 
attached to her, he will change the position of the water- 
pails ; if not, he will pass out of the room without touch- 
ing them. Tradition tells how, on one occasion, the 
lover who had been thus invoked, while moving the 
pails of water, let fall a rope with a noose at the end, 
which the young woman took up the next morning and 
laid in her press. She was married soon afterwards to 
the man whose form she had beheld, but within a fort- 
night of the marriage, he hung himself with that very

The use of holly in this form of divination recalls a 
somewhat different use made of it in Northumberland. 
We hear there of he-holly and she-holly, according as 
it is with or without prickles, and the leaves of the she- 
holly are alone deemed proper for divination. These 
then there will be ‘aye love between them twae.’ The same rite has 
been practised in Northamptonshire. Witness the following lines from 
Clare’s ‘ Shepherd’s Calendar’ :— 
Or, trying simple charms and spells, 
Which rural superstition tells, 
They pull the little blossom threads 
From out the knotwoed’s button heads, 
And put the husk, with many a smile, 
In their white bosoms for a while. 
Then, if they guess aright the swain 
Their love's sweet fancies try to gain, 
’Tis said that ere it lies an hour, 
*Twill blossom with a second flower, 
And from the bosom’s handkerchief 
Bloom, as it ne’er had Jost a leaf.

WASHING THE SARK. . 79 
‘smooth and unarmed’ leaves, as Southey calls them, 
must be plucked, late’on a Friday, by persons careful to 
preserve an unbroken silence from the time they go out 
to the next morning’s dawn. The leaves must be col- 
lected in a three-cornered handkerchief, and on being 
brought home, nine of them must be selected, tied with 
nine knots into’ the handkerchief,and placed beneath 
the pillow. _ Dreams worthy of all credit will attend 
this rite, though, if the old rhyme be trustworthy, so 
would be any dream dreamt on that night and repeated 
the next day; for,— 
A Friday night’s dream on a Saturday told, 
Is sure to come true, if it’s ever so old.* 
On, Hallowe’en or New Year’s Eve a Border maiden 
may wash her sark, and hang it over a chair to dry, 
taking care to tell no one what she is about. If she 
lie awake long enough, she will see the form of her 
future spouse enter the room and turn the sark. We 
are told of one young girl, who, after fulfilling this rite, 
looked out of bed and saw a coffin behind the sark; it 
remained visible for some time, and then disappeared. 
The girl rose up in agony, and told her family what had 
occurred, and the next morning she heard of her lover’s 
death. In another instance the young woman is said 
to have seen her lover at first, but his image quickly 
vanished, and was replaced by a coffin; she was shortly 
afterwards married to the man, but he soon died and 
left her a widow. 
Another mode of divination is by the willow wand. 
Let a maiden take a willow-branch in her left hand, 
and, without being observed, slip out of the house 
and run three times round it, whispering all the time, 
‘ He that’s to be my gude man come and grip the end ot.’

80 SPELLS AND DIVINATIONS. 
During the third run, the likeness of her future: 
hushand will appear and grasp the other end of the 
wand. A sword is sometimes used instead of a wand, 
but, in this case, it must be held in the right hand. 
This spell somewhat resembles one by which Ger- 
man girls ascertain the colour of their future husband’s 
hair. They call it hair-snatching, and practise it 
thus. Between the hours of eleven and twelve at 
night, on St. Andrew’s Eve, a maiden must stand at 
the house door, take hold of the latch, and say three 
times, ‘Gentle love, if thou lovest me, show thy- 
self.” She must then quickly open the door wide enough 
to put out her hand, and make a rapid grasp out in the 
dark, and she will find in her hand a lock of her future 
husband’s bair.!” Belgian girls, who desire to see their 
husbands in a dream, lay their garters crosswise at the 
foot of the bed, and a looking-glass under their pillow ; 
in this glass the image of their future husband will 
appear.? 
A story is told of a young woman, who, on waking 
one New Year’s morning, found a sword lying at her 
bedside. Imagining that it had been used in the divina- 
tions of the previous evening, and carried away from its 
owner by some spirit who had been too rashly invoked, 
she took it up, and locked it in her chest. Those who 
find these swords or divining-rods always do this, lest 
the spirits make them a means of: temptation; at 
the same time, those who lose them are always rest- 
less tillthey can recover them. The young woman was 
afterwards married to a gentleman’s servant, and in 
course of time became a mother. One day, soon after 
her infant’s birth, she gave her husband the key of her 
chest, and begged him to give her some articles of 
1 Thorpe’s Mythology, vol. iii, p. 145. 2 bid. p. 273.

clothing from it: he opened the chest, beheld the sword, © 
recognised it as his own, seized it, and exclaiming, ‘ This 
is my sword which has troubled me so long!’ transfixed 
himself with it on the spot, to the consternation and 
horror of his poor wife. 
A new-laid egg offers another means of diving into 
futurity. On New Year's Eve, perforate with a pin 
the small end of the egg, and let three drops of the 
white fall into a basin of water. They will diffuse 
themselves on the surface into fantastic shapes of trees, 
&c. From these the initiated will angur the fortunes 
of the egg-dropper, the character of his wife, number 
of his children, and so forth. This is still practised in 
Denmark, where also, as a variety, the girls will melt 
lead on New Year’s Eve, and, pouring it into water, 
observe the next morning what form it has assumed. 
If it resembles a pair of scissors, she will inevitably 
marry a tailor; if a hammer, her husband will be a 
smith, and so on. 
The maidens in Durham have their own way of 
testing their lovers’ fidelity. They will take an apple- 
pip, and, naming the lover, put the pip in the fire. If 
it makes a noise as it bursts with the heat, she is 
assured of his affection; if it burns away silently, she 
will be convinced that he has no true regard for her. 
As to wishing, we have wishing-chairs here and there 
through the country. There is one at Finchale Priory, 
near Durham; and he who seats himself in it, breathes 
a wish, and tells no one what it is, will receive it. 
But there is an easier mode of gaining what one desires. 
If you see a horseshoe, or piece of old iron, on your _ 
path, take it up, spit on it, and throw it over your 
shoulder, framing your wish at the same time; keep 
the wish secret, and you will have it in time.

Or portents and auguries we find large mention 
made in the Wilkie MS. The number of trifling cir- 
cumstances held to presage good or evil is really 
astonishing. Thus, it is fortunate for the housewife if 
a brood of chickens turn out all cock-birds; very 
fortunate if her cabbages grow double—.e., with two 
shoots from one root; or ‘lucker,’ that is, with the 
leaves open instead of closing into a ‘stock’ or heart; 
fortunate, too, if she meet with potatoes, gooseberries, 
&c. of an unusual shape, or with peas and beans more 
than the usual number in the pod. A pod containing 
ouly one pea is equally auspicious. A spider descend- 
ing upon you from the roof is a token that you will 
soon have a legacy from a friend. Fuller, in his 
‘ Worthies,’ refers to this belief : ‘When a spider is found 
upon our clothes, we use to say, some money is coming 
towards us. The moral is this. Those who imitate 
the industry of that contemptible creature may, by 
God’s blessing, weave themselves into wealth, and pro- 
cure themselves a plentiful estate.’ 
On the other hand, the sudden loss of hair is a pro- 
gnostic of the loss of children, health, or property. He

who hears a loud stroke upon the table, as if by a wand 
or club, or three successive strokes, or the noise as of a 
bullet dropped upon the table, is a doomed man himself, 
or will soon hear of the death of a friend. Or, again, 
if a man dream that his teeth fall out, he will hear next 
day of the death of a friend, while a dream of fire 
prognosticates sorrow and pain. If you dream of a 
wedding, you will hear of a death; if you dream of 
water, you will hear of sickness. - 
A list of little superstitions of the same kind, still 
extant in the county of Durham, has been supplied to 
me by a careful observer. 
It is counted lucky there to carry in the pocket a 
crooked sixpence, or one with a hole in it, or to puta 
stocking on through inadvertence inside out. People 
with meeting eyebrows are thought fortunate fellows.' 
It is lucky to set a hen on an odd number of eggs; 
set her on even ones, and you will have no chickens. 
Again, if two persons wash their hands together in 
the same basin, they will be sure to fall out before bed- 
time. This is said all England over. If a person's 
hair burn brightly when thrown into the fire, it is a 
sign of longevity; the brighter the flame, the longer the 
life. On the other hand, if it smoulder away, and 
refuse to burn, it is a sign of approaching death.? If the 
1 This is curious, since in Icelandic sagas, a man with meeting eye- 
brows is said to be hamrammr, or a kveldulfr, that is, a werewolf. Thus 
Olaf Toennumbruni is spoken of in the Landnama, V.c. 10 as hamrammr, 
i.e, able to change his shape. His nickname signifies ono with drooping 
brows, but in later Icelandic folk lore, the eyebrows growing over the 
nose is a token of a man being a werewolf, The same idea holds in 
Denmark (Thiele Danmarks Folke Sagn, ii. p. 279), also in Germany 
(Simrock Deutscher Sagen, p. 467), whilst in Greece it is a sign that a 
man is a Brukolak or Vampire.—S. B. G.

down on the forehead, and retreats up the head above the temples.

nose itches, it is a sign that you will be crossed, or 
vexed, or kissed by a fool; if the foot, it foretells that 
you will soon tread on strange ground. Itching of the 
right hand portends receiving money; of the left hand, 
paying money; of the ear, hearing sudden news. If the 
right ear tingles, you are being spoken well of; if the 
left ear, some one is speaking ill of you. If you shiver, 
some one is walking over your future grave. If you 
stumble upstairs (by accident), you will be married the — 
same year; if you snuff out the candle you certainly 
will. If you sing before breakfast you will cry before 
supper. If you put a button or hook into the wrong 
hole while dressing in the morning, some misfortune 
will occur during the day. A mole at the back of the 
neck marks out the bearer of it as in danger of hanging. 
These are Durham sayings, but many of them are 
much wider in their range. The same may be said of 
the following, which were communicated by a friend at 
Leeds :— 
If a snake crosses the path, it will rain. 
If glowworms shine at night, it will soon rain. 
Spring has not arrived till you can set your foot on 
twelve daisies. 
March search, April try, 
May will prove if you live or die. 
If you take violets or primroses to a house in less 
quantity than a handful, all the owner’s young chickens 
or ducks will die. 
Before you kill anything it is necessary to wash your 
face. 
Eat pancakes on Shrove Tuesday, and grey peas on 
Ash-Wednesday, and you will have money in your 
pocket all the year round.

If you want to have extra good luck to your dairy, 
give your bunch of mistletoe to the first cow that calves 
after New Year’s Day. 
Turn the money in your pocket on the first sight of 
‘the New Moon, and you will always have plenty there; 
or, again, look at the first New Moon of the year through 
.a silk handkerchief which has never been washed. As 
many moons as you see through the handkerchief 
(the threads multiplying the vision), so many years will 
pass ere you are married. . 
Mr. Denham tells us that he once saw an old matron 
turn her apron to the New Moon to ensure good luck 
for the ensuing month. I may, perhaps, mention here, 
that apples are said to ‘shrump up’ in Devonshire if 
picked when the-moon is waning. 
To return to the Borders. A maiden can scarcely 
do a worse thing there than boil a dish-clout in her 
crock. She will be sure, in consequence, to lose all her 
lovers; or, in Scotch phrase, she would ‘boil all her 
lads awa.’ : 
If, on leaving your house, you see a black snail, seize 
it boldly by one of its horns and throw it over your left 
shoulder; you may then go on your way prosperously, 
but if you fling it over your right shoulder, you will draw 
down ill luck. This practice extends as far south as 
Lancashire. In Yorkshire it is unlucky to meet a 
white horse on leaving home; you must spit to avert 
“misfortune. 
Skir or kir-handed people, 7. ¢. left-handed ones, are 
not safe for a traveller to meet on a Tuesday morning. 
On other days it is fortunate to meet them. Again, if 
you enter another man’s house, with your ‘skir’ foot 
foremost, you draw down evil on its inhabitants. If, 
therefore, you have carelessly done so, you must avert 
 
-P-A-G-E-115

the mischief by going out, and making your entrance 
a second time with the right foot foremost. I conclude 
that this little superstition once held its ground in the 
South, for Dr. Johnson is said to have entertained it, 
and to have left a house and re-entered it right foot 
foremost, if on the first occasion he had planted his lett 
foot on the threshold. 
If any person deemed auspicious meet a young 
tradesman who has just donned his apron, and say 
to him, ‘Weel may ye brook (or dirty) your apron,’ the 
young man will be sure to do well in life. 
It is unlucky for a traveller on Monday morning to 
meet a man with ‘schloofy or flat feet; but mischief 
may be averted by returning home, eating and drinking, 
and starting afresh on one’s way. . 
If meat shrinks in the pot, it presages a downfall in 
life ; but if it swells to a large size, the master of the 
house will be prosperous in his undertakings. 
To sweep the dust out of your house by the front 
door is to sweep away the good fortune of your family : 
it must be swept inwards, and carried out in a basket 
or shovel, and then no harm will follow. 
It is unlucky, after one has started on a journey, to 
be recalled and told of something previously forgot- 
ten ; but the spell may be broken by asking for meat 
and drink, and partaking of it. This done, the journey 
may be resumed without fear. This little bit of super- 
stition, too, has crept southwards into England. A 
clergyman from Yorkshire tells me that.his grandfather, 
though anything but a weak man, would never turn 
back when he had once started on an expedition: he has 
been known to stand on horseback at the end of his 
grounds, shouting to the house for something that he 
had forgotten, rather than turn back for it.

Many north-country people would not, on any ac- 
count, lend another a pin; They will say, ‘You may 
take one, but, mind, I do not give it.” Akin to this is 
the objection, once universally felt, to giving a knife or 
other sharp implement; it would cut friendship | or love. 
Thus Gay, in his ‘ Shepherd’s Week :’ 
But woe is me! Such presents lnckless prove, 
For knives, they tell me, always sever love. 
“I have heard in Dutham of a schoolmaster who 
wished to reward one of his pupils with a knife, but 
dared not do so without receiving from the boy a pentiy, 
in order that the knifé might be purchased, not given.

séttlers did not bring the belief into England. — 
In the West Riding of Yorkshire it is thought sinful 
to burn evergreens which have been used for decorations; 
‘or, again, to point at the stars, or try to count them.

I believe that this idéa extends to Durham. 
No one in the Borders will put on a new coat or 
dress without placing some money at once in the right- 
hand pocket. This ensures the pocket being always 
fuli; but if, by mistake, it is put in the left-hand 
pocket, you will never have a penny so long as you 
wear the coat,

the former, you will have pleitty of meat to eat during 
the year; ifthe latter, look for nothing beyond milk aiid 
vegetables. As far south 48 Lancashire, it is thought 
lucky to see the first lamb’s head, and unlucky to see its 
tail. 
As to the spilling of salt, it is considered ominous 
in the North as elséwheré; and he whose misplaced 
courtesy should lead him to offer to place salt on the 
plate of a northern, would probably be repelled with 
the words: 
Help me to salt, 
Help me to sorrow! 
The ill luck tiay, however, be averted by a sécond 
help. It is thought unlucky through the North to turn 
a loaf upside down, after helping oneself from it. 
Along the coast, they say, that for every loaf so turned 
a ship will be wrecked. If a loaf parts in the hand 
while you are cutting it, it bodes dissension in the 
family: you part man atid wife. 
In Aberdeenshire it is believed, that whosoever pulls 
the first stone out of a church, although it is for a good 
purpose, and to make way for a new one, will come to 
a violent end. My informant, a clergyman of the 
Church in Scotland, knew a casé in which no work- 
man had courage to begin, although the new place 
of worship had been built, The agent of the estate 
pulled out the first stone, and after that the labourers 
proceeded without further demur. In the same place 
there was great difficulty in bringing the new church- 
yard into use, No one would be the first to bury his 
dead there, for it was believed that the first corpse 
laid there was a teind to the Evil One. At last a poor 
tramp who was found dead in the road was interred, 
and after this there was no further difficulty. Now, I

have never heard of this superstition except in Devon- 
shire, where I know it to exist. The churchyard round 
St. John’s Church in the parish of Bovey Tracey, South 
Devon, was long unused, the countrypeople declaring that 
the devil would seize the first body laid in it. At lasta 
stranger was buried there, the servant of. a visitor in 
the parish, after which interments began at once to 
take place.} 
Birds have always supplied numberless auguries. 
When rooks desert a rookery it foretells the downfall of 
the family on whose property. it is. There is a Nor- 
thumbrian saying, that the rooks deserted the rookery 
at Chipchase, when the family of Reed left that place. 
On the other hand, the Wilkie MS. informs us, that 
when rooks haunt a town or village, mortality is sup- 
posed to await its inhabitants, and if they feed in the 
streets it shows a storm is near at hand. 
The same authority tells us that it isa very good 
omen for swallows to take possession of a place, and 
build their nests around it; while it is unpropitious for 
them to forsake a place which they have once tenanted. 
Now, the swallow, the herald of spring, has been held 
asacred bird by the whole Germanic race: it preserves 
the house on which it builds from fire and storms, and 
protects it from evil; while, in its turn, it is protected 
by the penalties which threaten the sacrilegious hand 
which should destroy it—the loss of dairy-produce, or 
1 Thus, in Germany, it is said that the first person who enters a new 
church becomes the property of the devil. At Aix-la-Chapelle is shown 
a rent in the door, which is thus accounted for. The church was ready 
for consecration, and before anyone entered it a dog was driven in. The 
devil in a rage seized thedog, and flew away with it, shivering the door. 
In various parts of Germany, and in Norway, a dog or a pig was buried 
in the churchyard as an offering to the devil. He is thus outwitted, and 
receives a beast instead of a man as his tribute—S, B. G.

continued rain for four weeks. In Yorkshire the punish- 
ment is not so defined, but itis considered certain to fall 
in one form or other. A farmer’s wife near Hull told 
afriend of mine, Mrs. L., how some young men, sons of 
a banker in that town, had pulled down all the swallows’ 
nests about a little farm which he possessed. ‘The 
bank broke soon after, she went on, ‘and, poor things, 
the family have had nought but trouble since! In 
Perigord the swallow is the ‘messenger of life; in 
some parts of France it shares with the wren the 
title of ‘poule de Dieu; and among our own pea- 
santry, those who say,— 
The robin and the wren, 
Are God Almighty’s cock and hen ; 
Him that harries their nest, 
Never shall his soul have rest, - 
add 
The martin and the swallow, 
Are God Almighty’s bow and arrow; 
or, as it runs in some of our midland counties :— 
The martin and the swallow, 
Are God Almighty’s birds to hollow. 
Archbishop Whately tells us, however, that in Ire- 
Jand the swallow is called the ‘devil’s bird’ by the 
vulgar, who hold that there is a certain hair on every 
one’s head, which if a swallow can pick off, the man 
is doomed to eternal perdition. In Scotland, on the 
other hand, the pretty little Yellow Hammer is called 
the ‘devil’s bird,’ and a superstitious dislike to it ex- 
tends as far south as Northumberland. My friend 
the Vicar of Stamfordham tells me that when the 
boys of his parish find its nest, they destroy it, say- 
ing:—

omens of a visitor. To turn the bee out is a most 
inhospitable action. 
As to the robin redbreast, it is invested with a sacred 
character all Christendom over, though various reasons 
are assigned for it in different countries. In Brittany 
it is reverenced for an act of devotion to the Crucified 
Saviour, in extracting one thorn from His crown, thus 
dyeing its own breast red; in Wales for daily bearing 
in its bill one drop of water to the place of ‘torment, in 
order to extinguish its flames. Boys always respect its 
nest: they say in Cornwall,—~ 
Who hurts the robin or the wren 
‘Will never prosper, sea or land. 
But the penalty attached to such sacrilege in Devon- 
shire is peculiar. A little boy in the neighbourhood of 
Dartmoor once told me that if you took a robin’s nest, 
all the ‘clomb’ (%.¢. crockery) in the house would 
break. 
In Scotland, however, the song of the robin is thought 
to bode ill to the sick person who hears it, and a simi- 
lar belief holds in Northamptonshire; where, indeed, the 
bird is counted a certain prophet of death, and is said 
to tap three times at the window ofa dying person’s 
room. Thus, again, at St. John’s College, Hurstpierpoint, 
the boys maintain that when a death takes place a 
robin will enter the chapel, light upon the altar, and 
begin to sing.

happened to be in the chapel one evening at six o'clock, when a robin

THE ROBIN AND THE WREN. 93 
The wren generally shares in the reverence paid to the 
robin; thus the two birds are named together in the 
Pastorals of George Smith, a.p. 1770 :— 
I found a robin’s nest within our shed, 
And in the barn a wren her young ones bred ; 
T never take away their nest, nor try 
To catch the old ones, lest a friend should die: 
Dick took a wren’s nest from bis cottage side, 
And ere a twelvemonth passed his mother died. 
Nevertheless, at Christmas-tide, boys are accustomed 
in Essex to kill wrens and carry them about in furze- 
bushes, from house to house, asking a present in these 
words :—~ 
The wren, the wren, the king of the birds, 
St. Stephen’s Day was killed in the furze ; 
Although he be little, his honour is great, 
And so, good people, pray give us a treat. 
Tt is remarkable that the custom extends to the Isle 
of Man, where the following verse is used :—~ 
We hunted the wren for Robin the Bobbin, 
We hunted the wren for Jack of the Can; 
We hunted the wren for Robin the Bobbin, 
We hunted the wren for every one. 
And after making a.-circuit, and collecting what money 
they can, the boys lay the wren on a bier and bury it. 
The same usage has prevailed in Ireland and in France; 
it is a singular one, and has been thus explained. The 
bird had a sacred character among our Celtic ancestors, 
as among the Greeks. It was a bearer of celestial fire, 
and disputed with the eagle the kingship of the 
feathered creation. Early Christian teachers opposed 
entered at the open circular east window in the temporary apse, and light- 
ing on the altar began to chirp. A few minutes later, the passing bell

The bawkie-bird, or bat, immortalised by Shakespear 
as ‘ the delicate Ariel’s’ steed, is in Scotland connected 
with witchcraft. ‘If says Mr. Wilkie, ‘the bat is 
observed, while flying, to rise, and then descend again 
earthwards, you may know that the witches’ hour is 
come—the hour in which they have power over every 
human being under the sun who is not specially shielded 
from their influence.’ 
The raven,? crow, and magpie® are ominous birds on

2 In Sweden, the ravens which scream by night in forest-swamps and 
wild moors, are held to be the ghosts of murdered men, whose bodies 
have been hidden in those spots by their undetected murderers, and not 
had Christian burial. In Denmark, the night raven is considered an 
exorcised spirit. There is a hole in its left wing, caused by the stake 
driven into the earth where a spirit has been exorcised. One must take 
care not to look up when the bird is flying overhead, for he who sees 
through the hole in its wing will become a night raven himself, and the 
night raven will be released. It is ever flying towards the east, in hopes 
of reaching the Holy Sepulchre, for when it arrives there it will get rest. 
The following Cornish story, however, presents the raven under another 
aspect, while it exhibits the Cornishman in his least favourable character, 
—that of a wrecker. A quarryman was working undera large block of 
stone which was on the point of falling. He was quite unconscious of 
his danger, but a raven perceived it, and resolved to save him. So the 
bird picked up a pebble, and dropped it on the miner's head. ‘Get 
along, you foul creature,’ cried the man, as he continued his work. No- 
thing daunted, the raven picked up another stone, and dropped it as be- 
fore. The fellow swore, but did not move a step. Then the bird flew 
to the shore, seized a bit of wood from a wreck, and dropped it before the 
quarryman. ‘ Hualloo!’ exclaimed he, ‘where that came from there is 
more to be got!’ and flinging away pick and shovel he rushed off to the 
beach. Down crashed the rock, but, thanks to the raven, the quarryman 
was safe.—S. B. G.

the Border, as elsewhere. A north-country servant thus. 
accounted for the unluckiness of the magpie to her 
master, the Rev. H. Humble. ‘ It was,’ the girl said, 
‘the only bird which did not go into the Ark with 
Noah; it liked better to sit outside, jabbering over the 
drowned world.’ . Yet, uncanny as the creature is, and 
mischievous too, there are parts of the Continent where 
no one dares kill it, An English traveller in Sweden 
once saw a flock of magpies greedily devouring the 
pigs’ food, and, having a gun with him, offered to shoot 
some. He did so, and the farmer thanked him heartily, 
but expressed his hopes that no harm might befal him 
in consequence.! 
I received my first lesson respecting the portents to 
be drawn from magpies very early in life. Well do I 
remember, when a boy of ten or twelve years old, driving 
an old lady in a pony-carriage, to visit a friend in a 
secluded part of the county of Durham. Half our 
journey was made when, without a word of warning, the 
reins were suddenly snatched out of my hand, and the 
pony brought toastand. Full of astonishment, I looked 
to my companion for some explanation of this assault 
on my independence, and saw her gazing with intense 
interest on a magpie then crossing the road. After a 
pause of some seconds she exclaimed, with a sigh, ‘ Oh, 
the nasty bird! Turn back, turn back!’ And back we 
turned, the old lady instructing me on the way honie in 
the following verse, which certainly justified the course 
we had taken: 
on Walpurgis night ride to the Blakulli, they go in the form of mag- 
pies. These birds moult in summer, and become bald about the neck ; 
and then the countrypeople say they have been to the Blakulli and 
helped the Evil Oneto get hishay in, and that the yoke has rubbed their 
feathers off.—(Thorpe’s Mythology, vol. ii. p. 84.)

One is sorrow, two mirth, 
Three a wedding, four a birth, 
Five heaven, six hell, : 
Seven the de’il’s ain sell. 
- The first couplet, with some variations, is in universal 
use; but I think, on the whole, the magpie receives 
more notice in the North of England than elsewhere. 
One clerical friend informs me of a lady in Yorkshire, 
who pleads guilty to making a cross in the air when she 
sees a magpie crossing her path, by way of dispelling 
the ill luck attending the bird; and another tells me 
how he himself invariably takes off his hat on catching 
sight of a single magpie, in the hope that by this polite 
attention he may avert the evil consequences attendant 
on the apparition. I have heard precisely the same 
thing of a man of education and good position in York- 
shire; and a lady of that county, Mrs. L , tells me 
a curious instance of the good effects of attending to 
the magpie’s warning. It relates to a gentleman with 
whom she was well acquainted, a county magistrate, 
and a landowner. One day, in the year 1825, he was 
riding to York with the view of depositing his rents in 
Chaloner’s Bank, when a magpie flew across his path. 
He drew up his horse, paused a moment, and turned 
homewards, resolving to defer his journey till the next 
day. That day, however, the bank failed, and it only 
remained for the gentleman to congratulate himself on 
his prudent attention to the magpie’s warning. 
Now, all this is very curious when viewed in connection 
with ancient pagan mythology. Auguries drawn from 
the flight and actions of birds formed a part of its com- 
plex system, from the days when Themistocles was 
assured of victory at Artemisium by the crowing of a 
cock, or Romulus claimed to be King of Rome from the  
-P-A-G-E-125

appearance of vultures. The Greeks made a science of 
these auguries and their interpretation, and called it 
Ornithomancy. Is it not marvellous to find traces of 
such direct heathenism among even the upper classes of 
a country Christianised so many ages back? Eleven. 
hundred years ago, efforts were made by doctors of the 
Church to root them out, but here they are still. We 
find Alcuin, who was born at York about a.p. 735, the 
friend of Charlemagne, and one of the glories of Anglo- 
Saxon times, writing thus to a bishop, evidently a 
Saxon one: ‘ Prognostics also, and cries of birds, and 
sneezings, are altogether to be shunned, because they 
are of no force except to those who believe in them, so 
that it may happen unto them according to their faith. 
For it is permitted to the evil spirit for the deceiving of 
persons who observe these things, to cause that in some 
degree prognostics should often foretell the truth.’ 
In another place Alcuin defines augurs as ‘those who 
pay attention to prognostics, and to the flight and voice 
of birds.’ : 
But to proceed. We can scarcely be surprised that 
lonely walks among the wild hills and cheerless moors 
of the North should be attended by superstitious fears, 
or that the strange unearthly cries, so like the yelping’ 
of dogs, uttered by wildfowl on their passage south- 
wards, should engender a belief in a pack of spectral 
hounds. Wordsworth speaks of it in a sonnet, evi- 
dently connecting it with the German legend of the 
Wild Huntsman. He tells of a peasant, poor and aged, 
yet endowed 
With ample sovereignty of eye and ear; 
Rich were his walks with supernatural cheer: 
He the seven birds hath seen that never part, 
Seen the seven whistiers on their nightly rounds,

And counted them! And oftentimes will start, 
For overhead are sweeping Gabriel’s hounds, 
Doomed with their impious lord the flying hart 
To chase for ever on aérial grounds. 
In Devonshire the spectral pack is called the ‘ Wisht 
hounds, a name which Mr. Kelly derives from Wodin’s 
name, Wunsch, corrupted into ‘ wisht.’ It has a hunts- 
man there who guides his pack over the wild wastes of 
Dartmoor ; but I cannot hear of such a being in my own 
neighbourhood. The Gabriel hounds, as they call them 
in Durham and some parts of Yorkshire, are described 
as monstrous human-headed dogs, who traverse the air, 
and are often beard though seldom seen. Sometimes 
they appear to hang over a house, and then death or 
calamity are sure to visit it. A Yorkshire friend 
informs me that when a child was burned to death in 
Sheffield, a few years ago, the neighbours immediately 
called to mind how the Gabriel hounds had passed 
above the house not long before. From another quarter 
I hear of a person who was hastily summoned one night 
to the sick-bed of a relative whose illness had suddenly 
assumed an alarming character. As heset out he heard 
the wild sound of the creatures above his head; they 
accompanied him the whole way, about a mile, then 
paused and yelped loudly over the house. He entered 
it, and found that the patient had just breathed her 
last. ~ 
In a letter from the late Mr. Holland, of Sheffield, 
dated March 28, 1861, is the following mention of this 
wild hunt, with a sonnet by him, embodying local feel- 
ings on the subject: ‘I can never forget the impres- 
sion made upon my own mind when once arrested by 
the cry of these Gabriel hounds as I passed the parish 
church of Sheffield, one densely dark and very still
-P-A-G-E-127

night. The sound was exactly like the questing of a 
dozen beagles on the foot of a race, but not so loud, and 
highly suggestive of idéas of the supernatural. 
<Oft have I heard my honoured mother say, 
How she has listened to the Gabriel hounds— 
Those strange unearthly and mysterious sounds, 
Which on the ear through murkiest darlmess fell ; 
And how, entranced by superstitious spell, 
The trembling villager not seldom heard, 
In the quaint notes of the nocturnal bird, 
Of death premonished, some sick neighbour's knell. 
I, too, remember once at midnight dark, 
How these sky-yelpers startled me, and stirred 
My fancy so, I could have then averred 
A mimic pack of beagles low did bark. 
Nor wondered I that rustic fear should trace 
A spectral huntsman doomed to that long moonless chase.’ 
We have the authority of the distinguished ornitho- 
logist, Mr. Yarrell,' for stating the birds in question to 
be bean-geese, coming southwards in large flocks on the 
approach of winter, partly from Scotland and its islands, 
but chiefly from Scandinavia. They choosedarknights for 
their migration, and utter a loud and very peculiar cry. It 
has been observed in every part of England—in Norfolk, 
in Gloucestershire, and as far west as Cornwall. A gentle- 
man was riding alone near the Land’s End on a still dark 
night, when the yelping cry broke out above his head, so 
suddenly, and to all appearance so near, that he instine- 
tively pulled up his horse as if to allow the pack to pass, 
the animal trembling violently at the unexpected sounds. 
Mr. Buckland? has reported portents of a somewhat 
similar character on the English Channel. A rustling 
rushing sound is heard there on the dark still nights of, 
winter, and is called the Herring Spear or Herring

Piece by the fishermen of Dover and Folkestone. This 
is caused by the flight of those pretty little birds the 
redwings, as they cross the Channel on their way to 
warmer regions. The fishermen listen to the sound 
with awe, yet regard it on the whole as an omen of good 
success with their nets. But they deprecate the cry 
of the ‘Seven Whistlers’ (named in the sonnet above 
quoted from Wordsworth), and consider it a death- 
warning. ‘I heard ’em one dark night last winter, said 
an old Folkestone fisherman. ‘They come over our 
heads all of a sudden, singing “ ewe, ewe,” and the men 
in the boat wanted to go back. It came on to rain and 
blow soon afterwards, and wasan awful night, sir; and 
sure enough before morning a boat was upset, and seven 
poor fellows drowned. I know what makes the noise, 
sir; it’s them long-billed curlews, but I never likes to 
hear them.’ 
But to return to the Gabriel hounds. In the neigh- 
bourhood of Leeds the phenomenon assumes another 
name and another character. It is there called ‘Gabble 
retchet,’ and held to be the souls of unbaptised chil- 
dren doomed to flit restlessly around their parents’ 
abode. Now, it is a widespread belief that such 
children have no rest after death. In North Germany 
they are said to be turned into the meteors called 
Will-o’-the-wisp, and so to flit about and hover between 
heaven andearth. In Scotland, unbaptised infants are 
supposed to wander in woods and solitudes lamenting 
their hard fate, and I know that afew years back, at 
Chudleigh, in Devonshire, a servant in the clergyman’s 
family asked her mistress, whether what the people of 
the place said was really true, about the souls of un- 
christened babies wandering in the air till the Judgment 
Day. And it is very remarkable that German folk
-P-A-G-E-129
THE. WILD HUNT. 104 
lore connects unbaptised infants with the’ Furious Host 
or wild hunt, which is evidently the same as the Gabriel 
hounds of the North and the Wisht hounds of the West of 
England. The mysterious lady Frau Bertha is ever 
attended by troops of unbaptised children, and she 
takes them with her when she joins the Wild Hunts- 
man, and sweeps with him and his wild pack across the 
wintry sky. 
Mr. Baring-Gould heard of this hunt in Iceland from his 
guide Jén, under the name of the Yule host; and in his 
‘Iceland, its Scenes and Sagas,’ pp. 199-203, he gives 
so lucid an account of the myth that I am thankful, by 
his kind permission and that of his publishers, Messrs, 
Smith, Elder, and Co., to insert it in these pages. My 
readers will observe that he lays all the rout to the 
charge of the wind, not of the bean-geese; and certainly 
a winter wind would account for any amount of confu- 
sion and turmoil, especially on the wild moors and hills 
of the North. Still Ido think that some of the wild 
stories and superstitions point to the birds in question 
as their originators, at least in part :— 
‘Odin, or Wodin, is the Wild Huntsman who nightly 
tears on his white horse over the German and Nor- 
wegian forests and moor-sweeps, with his legion of 
hellhounds. Some luckless woodcutter, on a still night, 
is returning through the pinewoods; the air is sweet- 
scented with matchless pine fragrance. Overhead the 
sky is covered with grey vapour, but a mist is on all 
the land ; not a sound among the fir-tops ; and the man 
starts at the click of a falling cone. Suddenly his ear 
catches a distant wail: a moan rolls through the inter- 
lacing branches: nearer and nearer comes the sound. 
There is the winding of a long horn waxing louder and
-P-A-G-E-130
102 PORTENTS AND AUGURIES. 
louder, the baying of hounds, the rattle of hoofs and 
paws on the pine-tree tops. A blast of wind rolls along, 
the firs bend as withes, and the woodcutter sees the wild 
huntsman and his rout reeling by in frantic haste. 
‘The Wild Huntsman chases the wood spirits, and he is 
to be seen at cockcrow, returning with the little Dryads 
hanging to his saddlebow by their yellow locks. This 
chase goes by different names. The huntsman in parts 
of Germany is still called Wéde, and the chase after 
him Wiithendes Heer.!. In Danzig the huntsman is 
Dyterbjernat, i.e. Diedrick of Bern, the same as Theo- 
doric the Great. In Schleswig, he is Duke Abel, who 
slew his brother in 1250. In Normandy, in the Pyre- 
nees, and in Scotland, King Arthur rides nightly through 
thé land. In the Franche-Comté, he is Herod in pur- 
suit of the Holy Innocents. In Norway, the hunt is 
called the Aaskarreya, the chase of the inhabitants of 
Asgarth. (Hence perhaps our word skurry.) In Sweden, 
it is Odin’s hunt. This is the Netherland account of it: 
In the neighbourhood of the Castle of Wynedal, there 
dwelt, a long time ago, an aged peasant, who had a son 
that was entirely devoted to the chase. When the old 
peasant lay on his deathbed, he had his son called to 
him, for the purpose of giving him a last Christian ex- 
hortation. He came not, but whistling to his dogs 
went out into the thicket. At this the old man was 
struck with despair, and he cursed his son with the 
appalling words : ‘ Hunt, then, for ever !—ay, for ever |” 
He then turned his head and fell asleep in Christ. 
From that time the unhappy son has wandered restless 
about the woods, and the whole neighbourhood re-echoes 
with the voice of the huntsman and the baying of dogs. 
1 The German word wuth is cognate with the name Odin, Our old 
English word ‘wood,’ equivalent to mad, is similarly related.
-P-A-G-E-131
THE WILD HUNT. 103 
‘In Thuringia and elsewhere, it is Hakelnberg, or 
Hackelnbirend, who thus rides, and this is the reason. 
‘Hakelnberg was a knight, passionately fond of the 
chase. On his deathbed he would not listen to the 
priest, nor hearken to his mention of heaven. “T care 
not for heaven,” growled he, “I care only for the hunt!” 
“Then hunt until the last day!” exclaimed the priest. 
And now, through storm and rain, the wild huntsman 
fleets. A faint barking or yelping in the air announces 
his approach, a screechowl flies before him, called by 
the people Tutésel. Wanderers who fall in his way 
throw themselves on their faces, and let him ride over 
them. 
‘Near Fontainebleau, Hugh Capet is believed to ride, 
at Blois, the hunt is called the Chasse Macabée. 
‘Children who die unbaptised often join the rout. 
Once two children in the Bern Overland were on a 
moor together; one slept, the other was awake; sud- 
denly the wild hunt swept by, a voice called, “Shall we 
walte the child?” “No!” answered a second voice, “ it 
will be with us soon.” The sleeping child died that 
night. Gervaise of Tilbury says, that in the thirteenth 
century, by full-moon towards evening, the wild hunt was 
frequently seen in England traversing forest and down. 
In the twelfth century it was called in England the 
Herlething; it appeared in the reign of Henry IL., and 
was witnessed by many. The banks of the Wye was 
the scene of the most frequent chases; at the head of 
the troop rode the ancient British Herla. 
‘King Herla had once been to the marriage-feast of 
a dwarf who lived in a mountain. Ashe left the bridal 
hall, the host presented him with horses, dogs, and 
hunting gear; also with a bloodhound, which was set 
on the saddlebow before the king, and the troop was

bidden not to get off their horses till the dog leaped 
down. 
‘On returning to his palace, the king learned that 
he had been absent for two hundred years, which had 
passed ag one night, whilst he was in the mountain 
with the dwarf. Some of the retainers jumped off their 
horses and fell to dust, but the king and the rest ride 
on till the bloodhound bounds from the saddle, which 
will be at the last Day. 
‘In many parts of France the huntsman is called 
Harlequin, or Henequin; and I cannot but think that 
the Italian Harlequin on the stage, which has become 
a necessary personage in our Christmas pantomime, is 
the Wild Huntsman. It is worth observing that the 
Yule or Christmas, the season of pantomimes, is the 
time when the wild huntsman rides, and his host is often 
called the Yule troop. 
‘I have said that the Wild Huntsman rides in the 
woods of Fontainebleau. Heis known to have blown 
his horn loudly, and rushed over the palace with’ all 
his hounds, before the assassination of Henry IV. 
“On Dartmoor,in Devonshire, the same chase con- 
tinues; it is called the Wisht hunt, and there are 
people now living who have witnessed it. 
‘Now for the names, Wéd, Herod, Hackelnbirend, 
&e. Perhaps Icelandic will help us to explain the 
myth. Wé6d is evidently Woden; the name is derived 
‘from the preterite of a verb, signifying to rage :—

red Jord. This name is known in the north (Hernath’s 
Saga, Kormuk Saga and Fornmana Sigur, ii. 259). 
But Dr. Mannhardt derives the name from Hrdths, 
rumour, faine. The name of Chasse Macabée is given 
from the allusion to it in the Bible (2 Maccabees 
v. 2-4). “Then it happened, that through all the city, 
for the space almost of forty days, there were seen 
horsemen running in the air, in cloth of gold, and 
armed with lances, like a band of soldiers. And troops 
of horsemen in array, encountering and running one 
against another, with shaking of shields, and multitudes 
of pikes, and drawing of swords, and casting of darts, 
and glittering of golden ornaments, and harness of 
all sorts. Wherefore every man prayed that that appa- 
rition might turn to good.” 
‘When men began to name the different operations 
of nature, they called the storm, from its vehemence, 
its rage, “the raging”—Wuothan, Wéden ; or from its 
coming at regular times, tempestus; or from its out- 
pourings, daira (cogn. Aardlw, Aatdccw, AdTTw); 
or again from its breathing, storm (styrma, Icelandic, 
to puff; sturmen, Teut., to make a noise; thus, Gisah 
trumbaro inti meniga sturmenta, Schilt, Thesaur., sub ~ 
voce—Christ saw the musicians and the multitude 
making a noise); our word gale comes from its whis- 
tling and singing—the root is also preserved in nightin- 
gale, the night-singer (gala, Icel. cogn. yell), and 
from this Odin (the storm) got his name of Galdnir, 
or Géldnir, and Christmastide was hight Yule; or 
from its gushing forth like a flood, we get the word 
gust (Icel. geysa and gjésa); or, once more, from the 
storm cloaking the sky, covering the fair blue with 
a mantle of cloud, it got its name of Procella (cogn. 
celo, rpoxadumrw, I screen with a cloak); and so we

find the Wild Huntsman, who, you see, is the storm, 
called Hackelnbiérend, from Hekluberandi, the cloak- 
bearer. 
‘Now, in the first ages, there was no intention what- 
ever of making the raging storm into a god, nor 
expressing a divine act in saying that the storm chased 
the sere leaves ; yet, by degrees, the epithet Wéden was 
given form and figure, and became personified as a 
deity; then, too, the idea of the storm chasing the 
leaves became perverted into a myth representing 
Wéden as pursuing the yellow-haired wood-nymphs.’ 
But to return to auguries and portents. The men- 
tion of sneezings in the passage quoted in page 97 from 
Alcuin is remarkable, for here again a very early super- 
stition holds its ground in the nineteenth century. 
Nurses in Durham, not to say mothers, still invoke a 
blessing on children when they sneeze; indeed, some 
extend the practice to adults. In Germany such is 
certainly the case. A young cousin of mine, lately at 
school in the Duchy of Wurtemburg, was greatly 
astonished to find that a fit of sneezing in which one 
of the professors indulged, was responded to by a cry 
from all the pupils of ‘Gesundheit,’ or * good health; 
an attention which he seemed to expect as much as the 
Emperor Tiberius, who was extremely particular in 
requiring it from his courtiers. The practice comes 
from early pagan days. The ancient Greeks, in obser- 
ving it, claimed to follow the example of Prometheus, 
who stole celestial fire to animate the beautiful figure 
che had made of clay; as the fire permeated its frame, 
the newly-formed creature sneezed,! and the delighted

vitality by sneezing seven times._S. B. G,
-P-A-G-E-135
SNEEZING. 107 
Prometheus invoked blessings on it. At any rate the 
custom was of long standing in Aristotle’s days. St. 
Chrysostom names sneezing among other things of 
which people made a sign, and St. Eligius warns his 
flock to take no notice of it. It has, however, been 
noticed, and good wishes have been uttered on the 
occasion far and near, in Christendom and heathendom 
alike—in the remotest parts of Africa, and as far east 
as Siam. Clarke in his Travels refers to the usage as 
common in Scandinavia, and in the year 1542, when 
Hernando de Soto, the famous conquestator of Florida, 
had an interview with the Cacique Guachoya, the 
following curious incident occurred. In the midst of 
their conversation, the Cacique happened to sneeze; 
upon this, all his attendants bowed their heads, opened 
and closed their arms, and making their signs of vene- 
ration, saluted their prince with various phrases of the 
same purport: ‘May the sun guard you!’ ‘May the 
sun be with you?’ ‘May the sun shine upon you, defend 
you, prosper you!’ and the like.’ 
I will close this chapter with a verse on sneezing, 
which is current in Buckinghamshire to this day :— 
Sneeze on Monday, sneeze for danger, 
Sneeze on Tuesday, kiss a stranger, 
Sneeze on Wednesday, get a letter, 
Sneeze on Thursday, something better, 
Sneeze on Friday, sneeze for sorrow, 
Saturday, see your true-love to-morrow.

On the, Borderland, as elsewhere, superstition is apt 
boldly to intrude into the physician’s province, and 
proffer relief in every ill that flesh is heir to, by means 
which he does not condescend to recognise—that is, by 
charms and spells. Curiously enough, the Wilkie MS. 
is perfectly silent on this head, but through the kindness 
of my friends, I have been enabled to collect a good deal 
of information respecting these byways to health and 
strength as practised in the northern counties of Eng- 
land. There is scarcely an ailment for which there is 
not some remedy at hand; for some a large variety are 
offered. Thus for warts, a schoolboy’s first trouble, a 
Northumbrian Jad has fhe choice of several modes of 
relief. He may take a large black snail, rub the wart 
well with it, and throw the poor creature against a 
thorn hedge, confident that as it perishes on one of the 
twigs the warts will disappear. This remedy has been 
practised very widely, and still lingers in Hampshire 
and in Devonshire, where the victim slug or snail may

yet be seen impaled on its.thorn-bush. Again, he may 
count the number of warts which torment him, put 
into a small bag an equal number of pebbles, and drop 
the bag where four roads meet. Whoever picks up the 
bag will get the warts. This charm is practised, too, in the 
West of England. It is sometimes varied by the substitu- 
tion of a cinder applied to the warts and then tied up 
in paper. A third plan is to steal a piece of raw meat, 
rub the warts with it, and throw it away. Southey 
mentions this little charm in ‘The Doctor.’ Did he learn 
it among the hills of Westmoreland? A -fourth is to 
make as many knots in a hair as there are warts on the 
hands, and throw it away. A fifth is to apply eel’s 
blood. Again, boys take a new pin, cross the warts with 
it nine times, and fling it over the left shoulder; or they 
cut an apple in two, rub the wart with each part, tie 
the apple together, and bury it, confident that as the 
apple decays the warts will disappear. This, too, is done 
in Devonshire, where they also take a wheat stalk with 
as many knots as there are warts on the hand to be 
dealt with, name over the stalk the person afflicted, and 
then bury it. As it decays the warts will disappear. 
My informant, a clergyman from Devonshire, pleads 
guilty to having used this charm himself, and by means of 
it cured his brother of some stubborn warts. He adds: 
‘Gypsies charm away warts. I have known an instance 
of their curing them in this way. I know, too, a curious 
case of the kind, substantiated by the master and boys of 
Marlborough Grammar School. A boy had his hands 
covered with warts, which disfigured them most ui- 
pleasantly. As the lad passed the window of an old 
woman in the town who dabbled a little in charms and 
spells, she looked out and called to him to count his 
warts. He did so, and told her the exact number.
-P-A-G-E-138

“By such a day,” she said, naming a day within the 
fortnight, “they shall all be gone.”. She shut the 
window, and the boy passed on, but by the day indicated 
every one of the warts, which had troubled him for 
years, was gone.’ 
The vicar of Stamfordham, i in Northumberland, tells 
me of an old man in that village who charmed away 
that obstinate complaint the ringworm. His patients 
were obliged to come to him before sunrise, when he 
used to take some earth from his garden and rub the 
part affected while repeating certain words not re- 
corded. The secret of this charm might be communi- 
cated by a man to a woman or vice versé, but if man 
told it to man or woman to woman the spell would be 
broken. 
Several cures for whooping-cough are practised in 
this village, and doubtless in the whole neighhourhood : 
such as putting a trout’s head into the mouth of the 
sufferer and, as they say, letting the trout breathe into 
the child’s mouth; or making porridge over a stream 
running from north to south. This last rite was per- 
formed not very long ago at a streamlet, near a spring- 
head, which runs for above fifty yards due south, 
through a field called Fool or Foul Hoggers, near West 
Belsay. A girdle was placed over this stream, a fire 
made upon the girdle, and porridge cooked upon it, 
and the number of candidates was so great that each 
patient got but one spoonfulas a dose. This story was 
related to the Rev. J. F. Bigge by one of the recipients ; 
it took place when she was a girl. 
Another plan consists in tying round the child’s neck 
a hairy caterpillar in a small bag. As the insect dies 
the cough vanishes. And-another in carrying the patient 
through the smoke of a limekiln. Children have

CURES FOR WHOOPING-COUGH. lil 
lately been brought from some distance to the lime- 
kilns at Hawkwell near Stamfordham, and passed 
backwards and forwards. A variation of this treatment 
prevails in my native city. Last winter a little girl 
suffering from whooping-cough was taken for several 
days successively to the gasworks, to breathe what her 
mother called ‘the harmonious air’ (I imagine she 
had some notion of ammonia in her head !), and I learnt 
from her that several other children were in atten- 
dance at the time for the same purpose. 
Again, the little sufferer may be passed under the 
belly of an ass or a piebald pony with good hopes of 
a cure in consequence. This is carried out more fully at 
Middlesborough, where a friend of mine lately saw a 
child passed nine times over the back and under the 
belly of a donkey, and was informed by the parents that 
they hoped thus to cure it of whooping-cough. The 
mention of a piebald pony is curious, for Abp. Whately 
observes in his ‘ Miscellaneous Remains’ (p. 273), that 
a man riding on such a horse is supposed, in virtue 
of his steed to have the power of prescribing with suc- 
cess for the whooping-cough, and is promptly obeyed ; 
so that when such a person once said to the enquiring, 
parents, ‘Tie a rope round the child’s neck,’ the rope 
was tied without the least hesitation. 
From the late Dr. Johnson I learnt of another remedy 
current in Sunderland: the crown of the head is shaved 
and the hair hung upon a bush or tree, in firm belief that 
the birds carrying it away to their nests will carry away 
the cough along with it. A somewhat similar notion lies 
at the root of a Devonshire mode of cure. Put a hair 
of the patient’s head between two slices of buttered 
bread and give it toadog. The dog will get the cough 
and the patient lose it. Another Devonian remedy
-P-A-G-E-140

is to place a smooth mullien leaf under the heel of the 
left foot. 
Another mode of cure for this scourge of childhood 
prevails in the North of Ireland. A lady residing in the 
county of Derry, my own near relation, tells me that a 
short time ago her servants summoned her out of doors 
to see a stranger who was peering about in the yard 
but would not speak to any of them. She went, and 
found a respectable middle-aged woman, apparently 
afarmer’s wife, who, seeing her to be the mistress of the 
housé, eagerly went up and prayed her to save her child. 
In answer to the lady’s enquiries the woman said, ‘ My 
child is dying of whooping-cough ; the doctors can do 
nothing more, so I went to a skilled man, and he told 
me to filla small bottle with milk and take it to a house 
IT had never visited before. I must cross the water 
three times to get to it, and must speak no word by 
the way till I see the master or the master’s wife of this 
strange house. Then I must tell my tale and ask 
whether they keep a ferret. If they do I must pour 
the milk in a saucer, see the ferret drink half of it, 
return the other half into the bottle, take it home and 
give it to the child. He will drink it and be cured at 
once. Now I see you have ferrets, let me have one 
at once. I have been out so many days and have 
not been able to find a strange house where they kept 
them.’ My friend, as kindly as she could, endeavoured 
to disabuse the poor woman’s mind of this strange super- 
stition, but a belief in it was deeply rooted in her 
mind. 
Since I received this narration I find that something 
similar holds its ground in my own county. The fol- 
lowing’ instance is communicated to me by the Rev. 
J. W. Hick of Byer’s Green:—‘A boy came into my
-P-A-G-E-141
CURE FOR TOOTHACHE, 113 
kitchen the other day with a basin containing a gill of 
new milk, saying his mother hoped I would let my son’s 
white ferret drink half of it, and then he would take 
the other half home to the bairn to cure its cough. I 
found the boy had been getting milk in the village for 
some days, and thus giving our ferret half of it” 
For toothache there is remedy also. The inhabitants 
of Stamfordham, the Northumbrian village named al- 
ready, have been accustomed to walk to Winter’s 
Gibbet, on Elsdon Moor, some ten or twelve miles off, 
for a splinter of the wood to cure toothache. How the 
wood was to be applied we are not told, but the remedy 
sounds almost as ghastly as that resorted to for the 
same purpose at Tavistock in Devonshire—biting a 
tooth out of a skull in the churchyard, and keeping 
it always in the pocket. 
Nor is weakness of the eyes uncared for. I have 
myself scen and handled a talisman from the Tweed- 
side, which inthe hands of an old witch-woman was 
deemed powerful to heal them. It was called a lammer- 
bead, Jammer being the Scotch for amber, from the 
French ‘Vambre;’ and wondrous were the cures it 
‘wrought, in the witch-woman’s hands, when drawn over 
inflamed eyes or sprained limbs. It is apparently of 
amber, and probably was dug out of an ancient British 
grave or barrow. The old woman has recently died, 
but the bead is cherished in her family as an heir- 
loom.! 
Of epilepsy the Rev. George Ornsby writes: ‘T 
1 Compare this with a Devonshire talisman. In the parish of 
Thurshelton, North Devon, lives an old lady (Miss Soaper), possessed of 
a bluish-green stone called the ‘kenning stone,’ which is much, resorted 
to by people troubled with sore eyes. If the eye be rubbed with the 
stone, the sufferer is cured.—S. B. G.

remember, when a boy, application being made to my 
father for a halfcrown, to be offered by him the next 
time he went to Holy Communion at Lanchester 
Church, and asked for again on behalf of the applicant, 
in order that it might be made into a ring to be worn 
by an epileptic patient” In Yorkshire the charm is 
rather different. The ring must be made of a half- 
crown from the Offertory collection, but thirty pence 
are tendered for it, collected from as many different 
persons. Not ten years ago, the Vicar of Danby, near 
Whitby, was asked for a halfcrown after Holy Com- 
munion, by a farmer, one of his most respectable pa- 
tishioners, the thirty pence being prepared in exchange. 
I may perhaps fitly add here, that a belief in the 
efficacy of the sacred elements in the Eucharist, for the 
cure of bodily disease, is widely spread throughout the. 
North, A clergyman has informed me that he knows 
of one element having been secreted for this purpose, 
and that he has found it necessary to watch persons 
who appeared to have such an intention. 
Certain superstitious beliefs are undoubtedly very 
widely spread. Silver rings made from Offertory money 
are still worn by epileptic patients in the Forest of 
Dean, and, with some variation, the charm is in use in 
Devonshire. A relation of mine in that county writes 
of it thus: ‘ Twenty years ago, soon after we settled in 
this place, we were surprised by a visit from a farmer, 
a respectable-looking man, from Ilsington, a village 
. about six miles off With a little hesitation he intro- 
duced himself, and told us that his son had long been 
a sufferer from the falling-sickness, that medical care 
had utterly failed, and as a last resource he had been 
advised to collect seven sixpences from seven maidens 
in seven different parishes, and have them melted down
-P-A-G-E-143

into aring for the Jad to wear. “I can’t tell you,” 
he went on, “how many miles I have travelled on 
this business, for the villages hereabouts are far apart. 
So hearing a family of ladies had settled here, I 
thought I would come up the hill, to see if one among 
them had a heart kind enough to help my poor Bill.” 
The appeal was irresistible; the sixpence was given, 
and the simple-hearted countryman went away fall of 
gratitude, but not daring to utter it for fear of breaking 
the spell.’ Some such superstition has doubtless pre- 
vailed, more or less, at some period through the length 
and breadth of England. My kind contributor, Mrs. 
L » has forwarded to me the following extract from 
a curious old journal and account-book, kept by a 
Lincolnshire gentleman, the uncle of her grandfather, 
in the year 1754 :—

Very different is the treatment of epilepsy in the 
North of Scotland, as: made known to us by Dr. Mitchell, 
in his deeply interesting paper on the Superstitions of 
the North-west Highlands and Islands of Scotland.' 
For the cure-of this disease, he informs us that a literal 
downright sacrifice to a nameless but secretly acknow- 
Jedged power is practised there: ‘On the spot where 
the epileptic first falls, a black cock? is buried alive, 
} Edinburgh: Mill and Co, (1862). 
? Black cocks have been extensively used in magical incantations and 
in sacrifices to the devil. A French receipt for raising the devil runs 
as follows: Take a black cock under your left arm, and go at midnight 
to where four cross-roads meet. Then cry three times ‘Poule noire!’ or 
*Poule noire 4 vendre!’ or else utter Robert nine times; and the devil will 
appear, take the cock, and leave you a handful of money. The famous 
r2

along with a lock of the patient’s hair and some parings 
of his nails. I have seen at least three epileptic idiots 
for whom this is said to have been done. A woman who 
assisted at such a sacrifice minutely described to me the 
order of procedure. According to Dr. Mitchell, this 
sacrifice dates from remote antiquity, and is very widely 
spread. The cock, a creature consecrated to Apollo, who 
in classic mythology was in some measure connected with 
the healing art, was in Egypt sacrificed to Osiris, whom 
we may regard as the same divinity under another 
title. This bird has, throughout the East, been sacri- 
ficed during the prevalence of infectious disease, and in 
Algeria it is still drowned in a sacred well to cure epi- 
lepsy and madness. 
The purely Celtic superstitions have, indeed, an un- 
mistakably heathen character about them which is 
almost appalling. One author transcribes, from the old 
records of the Presbytery of Dingwall, extracts which 
show that down to .p. 1678, bulls were sacrificed on 
Jewish banker, Samuel Bernard, who died in 1789, leaving an enormous 
property, had a favourite black cock, which was régarded by many a8 
uncanny, and as unpleasantly connected with the amassing of his fortune. 
The bird died a day or two before his master. 
Further, a black cock sings in the Scandinavian Niflheim, or ‘land of 
gloom,’ and the signal of the dawn of Ragnavok, ‘ the great day of arous- 
ing,’ is to be the crowing ‘of a gold-coloured cock. Guibert de Nogent 
writes (De vita sua, 1 r. ¢. 26): ‘A certain clerk lived in the country of 
Beauvais; he was a scribe, and I knew him. Once he had @ conversa- 
tion with another clerk, a sorcerer, in the castle of Breteuil, who said to 
him, “If it were worth my while, I would show you how you might daily 
make money without having to work for it.” The other having asked 
him how this could be accomplished, the sorcerer replied, “You must 
make a sacrifice to the citizen of hell, that is, the devil.” “ What victim 
should I have to offer ?” asked the other. “A cock,” replied the sorcerer, 
“but it must be a cock born of an egg laid of a Monday in the month of 
March. After having roasted the cock at the beginning of night, take 
it with you, still on the spit, and come with me to the nearest fishpond,”’

SACRIFICE AT INNIS MAREE. iW 
August 25 at the little island of Innis Maree, in Loch 
Maree, and milk poured forth upon the hills as a 
libation. Several members of the Mackenzie family 
were cited that year before the Presbytery, ‘for sacri- 
ficing a bull in ane heathenish manner, in the island of 
Saint Rufus, commonly called Ellan Moury in Lochew, 
for the recovery of the health of Cirstane Mackenzie, 
who was formerly sick and valetudinarie,’ and it appears 
that the rite was one frequently performed. The 25th 
of August is the feast-day of St. Malrubius, now called 
Mourie or Maree, the patron saint of the district; but 
the people of the place often call him the God Mourie, 
which plainly shows that the worship formerly paid to 
some local Celtic divinity has been transferred to the 
saint. When it finally disappeared we are not informed, 
put a similar observance has been handed on to our 
own day in the county of Moray. Not fifteen years 
ago, a herd of cattle in that county being attacked with 
maurrain, one of them was sacrificed by burying alive, as 
a propitiatory offering for the rest. Only among the 
Celtic population of Cornwall can we find a parallel to 
this. I have been informed that within the memory 
of man, in a remote village of that county, a calf has 
been sacrificed during a visitation of sickness among 
cattle, but I regret to say that I have been unable to 
verify the statement,! 
The same ferocious character may be traced in the 
remedy for erysipelas, lately practised in the parish of 
1 I have been told that on Midsummer-day, on Buckland-in-the- 
Moor, in Devonshire, a number of people assemble ina field called the 
Ploi-field, in the midst of which is a huge granite block. The young 
men then range the moors in quest of a sheep, which when caught is 
‘prought to the stone and there stabbed to death with their knives, after 
which they sprinkle themselves and others with the blood. The day

Lochearron, in the North-west Highlands: it consists

the blood drop on the part affected. 
Ague is a disease which has always been deemed 
peculiarly open to the influence of charms. It is said 
in Devonshire that you may give it to your neighbour, 
by burying under his threshold a bag containing the 
parings of a dead man’s nails, and some of the hairs of 
his head : your neighbour will be afflicted with ague 
till the bag is removed. In Somersetshire and the 
adjoining counties, the patient shuts a large black 
spider into a box, and leaves it to perish ; in Flanders 
he imprisons it between the two halves of a walnut- 
shell, and wears it round his neck; in Ireland he 
swallows it alive. Flemish folk lore also enjoins any 
one who has the ague to go early in the morning to an 
old willow, make three knots in one of its branches, 
and say, ‘Good morrow, Old One ; I give thee the cold; 
good morrow, Old One.’ Compare with this a mode of 
cure practised in Lincolnshire. It was thus described 
by one gvho had suffered from the disease, and tried the 
remedy in her young days. She was an old woman 
when her clergyman, the Rev. George Ornsby, wrote it 
down in her own words. I may add that she has but 
recently died :—

dinner, I were stood looking at him, and talking ?him, 
and shakking all t’ time. ‘Young woman,” says he, 
“ ye’ve gotten t’ shakking (a name they commonly give 
to the ague) very bad.” “ Ay,” says I, “I have that.” 
“ Wad ye like to be shot on’t?” says he. “ Ay, that 
wud I,” says I. “ Why then,” says he, “thou mun do as 
I tell thee. Dost thou see yon espin-tree fother side 0°

ye believe me I were sorely flayed ; but howsomever

I suppose that the ceaseless trembling of the aspen~ 
leaves, even when all around is still, is suggestive of 
mystery ; for certain it is that this tree comes forward 
a good deal in the folk lore of different nations. The 
Bretons explain the phenomenon by averring that the 
Cross was made from its wood,! and that the trembling 
marks the shuddering of sympathetic horror.? The

of wood: the palm, the cypress, the olive, and the eedar—S. B. G.

Germans have a theory of their own, embodied in ‘a 
little poem, which may be thus translated :— 
Once, as Our Saviour walked with men below, 
His path of mercy through a forest lay; 
And mark how all the drooping branches show, 
What homage best a silent tree may pay! 
Only the aspen stands erect and free, 
Scorning to join that voiceless worship pure ; 
But see! He casts one look upon the tree, 
Struck to the heart she trembles evermore! 
If the Cross was thought to have been made of aspen- 
wood, the Crown of Thorns was in the Middle Ages said 
to have been formed of white-thorn branches, and the 
white-thorn was reverenced accordingly. Mr. Kelly, 
‘however, affirms that this tree possessed a sacred 
character in ancient heathen days, as having sprung 
from the lightning, and being, in consequence, scatheless 
in storms. It was used for marriage torches among the 
‘Romans, and wishing-rods were made from it in 
- Germany.! , 
But to return. The Rev. J. Barnby informs me of 
the following cure for St. Vitus’ Dance, the patient 
having been daughter to his parish clerk, in a Yorkshire 
village. Medical aid having failed, the parents deemed 
the girl bewitched, and would not be dissuaded from 
consulting a wise man, who lived at or near Ripon, thirty 
miles off. The wise man told them that if the disease 
came from an evil eye, an evil wish, or an evil prayer, 
he could remove it, but if by the direct visitation of God 
he could not. Accordingly, he tried the remedy for the 
‘first and second causes, but in vain. He then resorted 
to the proper measures for the third cause, which con- 
Modern Superstition) remarks that it is not simply Welsh but European, 
or, rather, coextensive with Christendom.

sisted chiefly in prayers; and the parents aver that at 
the very time of his praying the girl began to amend, 
she being ignorant meanwhile of what was going on. 
The wise man gave her a charm, to wear as a preserva~ 
tive against the person who had bewitched her, and the 
recovery was perfect. 
The following curious history was communicated to 
me by the Rev. J. F. Bigge. <A farmer’s wife who 
lived at Belsay-dean-home, towards the south-west of 
Northumberland, was suddenly seized with a violent 
bleeding at the nose; and the usual modes of stopping 
it having been tried in vain, one of the neighbours, who 
had clustered round her, said, ‘Gan away to Michael 
W—-, at Black Heddon, and fetch him quick. He'll 
ken o”’ summat to do her good.’ Now, this Michael 
W. was and is esteemed a wizard. The husband 
went off at once for the wizard, who came with him 
homewards across the Belsay burn, but stopped at that 
point, muttered some words, and saying, ‘She'll be well 
now,’ turned and went straight home. However, when 
the farmer got back, he found his wife as bad as ever ; 
so turning round he retraced his steps to Michael’s 
door, and told him the state of affairs. ‘It’s strange 
she’s no better,’ said Michael ; * but, eh! I’ve forgotten; 
there’s another burn which runs under the road near 
the lodge.” Back he went, crossed over that burn, 
repeated his charm, and confidently stated that the 
patient was better. The farmer went home, and found 
that the bleeding had stopped. © 
Goitre, that scourge’ of the Swiss valleys, is some- 
times found in our country, and superstition offers a 
remedy for it, though a revolting one. The Rev. J. W. 
Hick, Incumbent of Byer’s Green, informs me that on 
asking a parishioner thus afflicted whether she had tried  
-P-A-G-E-150
122 CHARMS AND SPELLS. 
any measures for curing it, she answered: ‘No, I have 
not, though I have been a sufferer eleven years. But 
a very respectable man told me to-day, that it would 
pass away if I rubbed a dead child’s hand nine times 
across the lump. I’ve not much faith in it myself, but 
Pve just tried it’ Somewhat similar measures were 
resorted to by another sufferer not many years ago. 
The body of a suicide who had hanged himself in 
Hesilden-dene, not far from Hartlepool, was laid in an 
outhouse, awaiting the coroner’s inquest. The wife of 
a pitman at Castle Eden Colliery, suffering from a wen 
in the neck, according to advice given her by a ‘ wise 
woman,’ went alone, and lay all night in the outhouse, 
with the hand of the corpse on her wen. She had been 
assured that the hand of a suicide was an infallible cure. 
The shock to the nervous system from that terrible 
night was so great that she did not rally for some 
months, and eventually she died from the wen. This 
happened about the year 1853, under the cognisance of 
my informant, the Rev. H. B. Tristram. It may be 
observed that they say in North Germany that tetters 
and warts disappear if touched by the hand of a corpse. 
Another friend, the Rev. J. Cundill, tells me how, 
while he was fishing a short time ago in Stainsby Beck, 
in Cleveland, a peasant came along the stream in 
search of a ‘wick’ (anglice, quick or live) trout, to lay 
on the stomach of one of his children who was much 
troubled with worms, a trout so applied being a certain 
cure for that complaint. A different mode of treatment 
was made known to me, in the autumn of 1863, by the 
fireside of my landlady’s kitchen at Sprouston, by the 
Tweedside, after a long day’s fishing. I was informed 
that water in which earthworms had been boiled was 
an. infallible remedy in such a case. J ventured to

demur to its efficacy, on which the old woman broke 
out, ‘Bless me, Mr. Henderson! will ye no believe that? 
Why, wasn’t Jeanie Wright fair brought back frae the 
grave when she was as gude asdead? A’ the doctors had 
gi’en her up, but there were them about her that wudna 
knuckle down without ane mair attempt. So they 
honkit a pint o’ worms, and biled them in fresh water, 
and gaed her the broo to drink. Frae that hour she 
began to mend, an’ now she’s as stout a woman as ony, 
an’ ye may see for yersell an ye gan to the west end o’ 
the town, for there she’s livin’ yet.’ 
For cramp our Durham remedy is to garter the left 
leg below the knee. An eel’s skin worn about the 
naked leg is deemed a preventive too, especially by 
schoolboys. The eel’s skin comes to light again in 
Northumberland. A sprained limb is bound up with 
it after the ‘stamp-strainer ’ has stamped upon it with 
his foot. This stamp-straining is practised in that 
county, and is said to have great efficacy. When the 
first pang is over, they declare that the operation is 
painless. The Rev. J. F. Bigge has noted down how 
one W. R., of Belsay Lake House, who was skilled in the 
art, stamped for a sprain the arm of J. R., and cured her. 
But to return to, the subject of cramp. Some 
people lay their shoes across to avert it; others wear a 
tortoiseshell ring; others place a piece of brimstone 
in their beds. Coleridge, in his ‘ Table-Talk,’ ! records 
the approved mode of procedure in Christ’s Hos- 
pital, which he believed had been in use in the school 
since its foundation in the reign of Edward VI. A 
boy when attacked by a fit of cramp would get out 
of bed, stand firmly on the leg affected, and make the 
sign of the cross over it, thrice repeating this formula:

a preservative against this complaint.! I learn from 
the Rev. George Ornsby that rings or handles from 
coffins, made up and worn as finger-rings, are deemed 
efficacious in the West Riding. So they are in Cleve- 
Jand. AmM@old watchmaker at Stokesley, Robert Ste- 
venson by name, used to cure ‘scores of people’ that 
way. But he confided to his choice friends that he 
never really made up the coffin-tyre they brought him : 
he took it from them, but it was less trouble to give 
them rings which he had by him. 
This may, perhaps, be a not unsuitable place for 
introducing an instance of Devonshire superstition, so 
peculiar that it seems worthy of record. It was related 
to my fellow-worker by her friend the late Dr. Walker, 
of Teignmouth, a physician of some local celebrity. 
Within the last twenty years he had under his care a 
poor woman of that place, who was suffering from an 
extensive sore on the breast. When he visited her one 
day he was surprised to find the entire surface of the 
wound strewn over with a gritty substance, and a good 
deal of inflammation set up in consequence. In some 
displeasure he asked what they had been putting on, 
but for a long time he could get no answer, beyond ‘ No- 
thing at all, sir’ The people about were sullen, but 
the doctor was peremptory; and at last the woman’s 
husband, rolling a mass of stone from under the bed,

muttered, in genuine Devonshire phrase, ‘ Nothing but 
Peter’s stone, and here he is!’ On further enquiry it 
appeared that, incited by the neighbours, who had de- 
clared his wife was not gétting well as she should, the 
poor fellow had walked by night from Teignmouth to 
Exeter, had flung stones against the figures on the 
west front of the cathedral (which is called St. Peter’s 
by the common people), had succeeded at last in bringing 
down the arm of one of them, and had carried it home 
in triumph. Part of this relic had been pulverised, 
mixed with lard, and applied to the sore. IT have never 
met with another instance of the kind, bu@doubtless 
it ig not a solitary one. If the practice was ever a 
general one, we need not lay to the charge of Oliver 
Cromwell’s army all the dilapidation of the glorious 
west front of Exeter Cathedral. , 
The treatment of surgical cases in the North by no 
means corresponds to that pursued by the Faculty. 
When a Northumbrian reaper is cut by his sickle, it 
is not uncommon to clean and polish the sickle. Lately, 
in the village of Stamfordham, a boy hurt his hand 
with a rusty nail. The nail was immediately taken to 
a blacksmith to file off the rust, and was afterwards 
carefully rubbed every day, before sunrise and after 
sunset, for a certain time; and thus the injured hand 
was perfectly healed. 
How well this mode of treatment corresponds with 
that pursued by the Ladye of Buccleugh towards the 
wounded mosstrooper, William of Deloraine, as re- 
counted by the ‘ Last Minstrel’ :— 
She drew the splinter from the wound, * * * * *

Probably Sir Walter Scott borrowed it as much 
from Border practice as from Border records. It seems 
in early days to have prevailed in many parts of the 
country, and still to linger here and there. Not long 
ago it wampractised on a hayfork in the neighbourhood 
of Winchester, and I lately heard a reference to it in 
Devonshire. A young relation of mine, while riding 
in the green lanes of that county, lamed his pony by 
its treading on a nail. He took the poor creature to 
the village blacksmith, who immediately asked for the 
nail, and finding it had been left in the road, said, as 
he shook his head, ‘Ah, sir, if you had picked it up 
and wiped it, and kept it warm and dry in your pocket, 
there’d have been a better chance for the pony, poor 
thing!’ 
The following communication from Mr. J. M. Twed- 
dle tells of the same belief in Yorkshire:—*Some years 
ago, a relation of mine was crossing the moors from 
Whitby to his home at Stokesley, when he heard a 
woman’s voice calling out loudly, “Canny man, canny 
man, d’ye come frae Stousley?” On his replying that 
he did, she begged him to take a harrow-tooth to the 
wise man of that place, as her husband had been injured 
by it, and she wished the wise man to polish and charm 
it. He took the harrow-tooth and placed it in his 
pocket, but, truth to tell, as soon as she was out of 
sight, he flung it away among the heather. However,
-P-A-G-E-155

when, some time after, he passed that way again, the 
poor woman recognised him and thanked him heartily 
for doing her errand, saying that her husband had 
mended from the day the wise man got the bit of iron.’ 
It is curious to compare with these narrations the 
mode of procedure prescribed in North Germany. Ifa 
person has wounded himself, let him cut, in an upward 
direction, a piece from a branch of a fruit tree, and 
apply it to the recent wound so that the blood may 
adhere to it, and then lay it in some part of the house 
where it is quite dark, when the bleeding will cease. 
Or, when alimb has been amputated, the charmer takes 
a twig from a-broom, and presses the wound together 
with it, wraps it in the bloody linen, and lays it ina 
dry place, saying,— 
The wounds of our Lord Christ 
They are not bound ; 
But these wounds they are bound, 
In the name, &c.! 
The sympathy here assumed between the cause of an 
injury and the victim, is in Durham held strongly to 
exist between anyone bitten by a dog and the animal 
that inflicted the bite. An inhabitant of that city 
recently informed me, that having been bitten in the 
leg by a savage dog about a month before, he took the 
usual precautions to prevent ultimate injury, but with- 
out satisfying his friends, more than twenty of whom 
had seriously remonstrated with him for not having the 
dog killed. This alone, they said, would ensure his 
safety ; otherwise, should the dog hereafter go mad, even 
years hence, he would immediately be attacked with 
hydrophobia. These persons were of the middle class,

The same belief, I find, prevails throughout Yorkshire! 
It is with reluctance that I approach the next anec- 
dote, for, in truth, I can never recall it without pain; it 
tells the sad effects of local treatment of rheumatism. 
About twenty years have passed, since, after a long day’s 
angling in the College (a small river which winds 
round the northern side of Cheviot), I entered the 
thatched cottage of a shepherd, which stood near the 
confluence of that stream with the Bowmont. The 
man and his wife bade me welcome, after the kindly 
hospitable fashion of that district. I grew interested 
in their conversation, and promised to visit them again 
when I came next into their neighbourhood. I did 
so during the following spring, but what was my 
grief at finding the man, who had seemed to me a 
model of strength, now a complete wreck; he was 
lying on a long. settle by the fireside, wrapped in 
blankets. The poor woman, on seeing me, burst into 
tears, and it was some time before her suffering hus- 
‘band could tell me his tale of too-confiding simpli- 
city. 
In the latter part of the preceding autumn, he had 
caught cold while tending his flock on the mountain 
side; acute rheumatism had followed; he suffered a 
good deal, and, being of a sanguine temperament, chafed 
at the slow but safe steps adopted by the surgeon of 
the district. As week after week passed by with little 
amendment, constant pain and impending poverty 
induced him at last, in an evil hour, to give heed to his

a viper, the viper is to be killed, and the fat applied to the wound as an

neighbours’ advice, and resort to ‘the wise man who lived 
far over the hills.” The wise man declared that the case 
was desperate,and demanded desperate remedies, As the 
first step, he directed that the sufferer should be wrapped 
in a blanket and laid in the sharp running stream which 
flowed a few yards from the cottage. This was done with 
full faith, though it was the depth of winter. Never 
shall I forget the poor victim as he turned his dying 
eyes on me and said, ‘Oh, sir, I laid there twenty 
minutes, but could endure it no longer; and I just 
said, “Lift me out—I’m dead.” They took me out, and 
T’ve laid on this settle ever since.’ Afew days more, 
and the poor fellow had passed (as we humbly trust) 
to a better life, a sacrifice to one of the most cruel and 
heartless impostures I ever heard of. Had not death 
intervened, who can tell what further tortures might 
not have been in store for him at the hands of this 
ignorant and presuming monster ? 
The Rev. Henry Humble has communicated to me 
a story respecting the treatment of rheumatism in 
Dundee, widely different in its nature and results. A 
clergyman went to see an old woman of that place, who 
had not moved off her chair for years in consequence 
of severe rheumatism, which had settled in the knee. 
As is common among the poor, she would make the 
minister feel the painful swelling. I should add that 
he is aman of great muscular power, and not always 
aware of the force with which he uses it. He laid his 
hand on the part affected, and soon left the room to visit 
at some other tenements in the same row. Before he 
had gone his rounds in that quarter, he heard some one 
call him, and turning round, beheld his old friend up 
and about, loudly proclaiming that the priest’s touch

had cured her. Certain it is, she has walked ever 
sinee.! 
Passing by, for the present, different modes of cure 
for persons who have been bewitched, we will turn 
to the diseases of animals, for local superstition does 
not deem these beneath her notice. A gentleman 
farmer in the West Riding of Yorkshire, having some 
cattle affected by the foul or fellen (my informant, 
the Rev. George Ornsby, forgets which) and having 
beard that an old man in the neighbourhood, who 
had long practised farriery, was famous for curing 
the disease, went to consult him. The case was duly 
laid before the old man, who replied, with the utmost 
gravity, that he had cured ‘a many,’ and that as 
he had given up practice, he did not mind if he told 
him his secret. His directions were few and simple ; 
the owner of the horse was to go at midnight into 
his orchard and grave a turf at the foot of the largest 
apple-tree therein, and then hang it carefully on the 
topmost bough of the tree, all in silence and alone. 
If this was duly performed, as the turf muddered 
away, so would the disease gradually leave the animal. 
The old farrier added that he had never known this 
mode of cure to fail. : 
This remedy is also mentioned in the late Mr. Den- 
ham’s ‘Folk Lore of the North of England,’ with one 
addition—the turf cut must be one on which the beast 
has trodden with its diseased foot. Many people, he 
Says, use no other remedy for the foul, looking upon 
this as an infallible cure. 
Another tale from Northumberland must be given in

the very words in which I received it from the Rev. 
J.¥F. Bigge, only premising that a poor woman had a cow, 
and that the cow was taken ill. The woman described 
its recovery as follows : ‘I was advised, ye ken, to gan to 
the minister, ye ken, and I thought he might do some- 
thing for her, ye ken; so a gaes.to the minister, ye ken, 
and a sees him about her. “Well, sir,” says I, “the coo’s 
bad; cuddn’t ye come and make a prayer o’er her like ?” 
“ Well, Janet,” says he, “I'll come.” And come he did, 
ye ken, and laid his hand on her shoulder, ye ken, and 
said, “If ye live ye live, and if ye dee ye dee.” Weel, 
ye ken, she mended frathathour. Next year whobut the 
minister should be ta’en ill, and I thought I wud just gan 
and see the auld minister—it was but friendly, ye ken. I 
fund him in bed, and I gans up till him, and lays my hand 
on his shoulder, and I says, “Ifye live ye live, and if ye 
dee ye dee.” So he burst out a-laughing, ye ken, and his 
throat got better fra that moment, ye ken.’ It would 
appear that the poor man was suffering from quinsy, 
which broke from the effort of laughing. 
At Lockerby, in Dumfriesshire, is still preserved.a 
piece of silver called the Lockerby Penny, which is 
thus used against madness in cattle. Itis put in a 
cleft stick, and a well is stirred round with it, after 
which the water is bottled off and given to any animal 
so affected. A few years ago, in a Northumbrian farm, 
a dog bit an ass, and the ass bit a cow; the penny was 
sent for, and a deposit of £50 actually left till it was 
restored. The dog was shot, the cuddy died, but the 
cow was saved through the miraculous virtue of the 
charm. On the death of the man who thus borrowed 
the penny, several bottles of water were found among 
his effects, stored in a cupboard, and labelled “Lockerby 
Water’ 
K2

132 CHARMS AND SPELLS. 
The Lockerby Penny is not, however, without a rival 
on the Borders. From time out of mind, the family of 
T., of Hume-byers, have possessed a charm called the 
‘Black Penny;’ it is said to be somewhat larger than 
a penny, and is probably a Roman coin or medal. When 
any cattle are afflicted with madness, the Black Penny 
is dipped in a well the water of which runs towards 
the south (this is indispensable) ; sufficient water is then 
drawn and given to the animals affected. Popular belief 
still formally upholds the value of this remedy. 
The waters of Loch Monar, a secluded lake near the 
Strath in the Highlands, claim to have a healing power 
of a somewhat similar character. Tradition avers that 
a woman who came from Ross-shire to live at Strath- 
naver, possessed certain holy or charmed pebbles, which 
when put into water imparted to it the power of curing 
disease. One day, when she was walking out, a man 
assaulted her, and tried to rob her of the stones; but she 
escaped from his hands, ran towards the lake, and 
exclaiming, in Gaelic, ‘Mo nar shaine,’ flung the pebbles 
into the water; the lake was forthwith endowed with 
marvellous powers of healing, put forth especially on 
the. first Mondays in February, May, August, and 
November. During February and November, however, 
it remains unvisited, probably on account of the severity, 
of the season ; but the Rev. D. Mackenzie, minister of 
Farr, attests that in May and August multitudes of 
people make pilgrimages to the Loch from Sutherland, 
Jaithness, Ross-shire, and even from Inverness and the 
Orkneys. The votaries must be on the banks of the 
Loch at midnight, plunge thrice into the waters, drink 
a small quantity, and throw a coin into the lake as 
a tribute to its presiding genius. They sedulously 
get out of sight of the Loch before sunrise, else they

consider that their labour will all have been in 
vain.! : 
Dr. Mitchell states, in the pamphlet already quoted, 
that in Lewis the diseases of cattle are attributed to the 
bite of serpents, and that the suffering animals are 
made to drink water into which charm-stenes are put. 
He does not describe these stones, but says that he has 
presented two, recently in use, to the Museum of Anti- 
quities ; they have been more resorted to for the disease 
of cattle than of men. ‘Burbeck’s Bone,’ however—a 
tablet of ivory, long preserved in the family of Campbell 
of Burbeck—was esteemed a sovereign cure for lunacy ; 
when borrowed, a deposit of £100 was exacted, in order 
to secure its safe return. 
In the neighbourhood of Stamfordham, Irish stones - 
are the favourite charms. The Rev. J. F. Bigge informs 
me that he knows of three, all in high estimation. A 
servant of Mrs.——, of Kyloe House, related to him how 
he was once sent to the house of a neighbouring lady to 
borrow such a stone. It had been brought from Ireland, 
and was never permitted to touch English soil. The 
stone was placed in a basket, carried to a patient with a 
sore leg, the leg rubbed with it, and the wound healed. 
People came many miles to be touched with these 
stones, but they were considered more efficacious in the 
hands of an Irish person. We learn from Mr. Denham’s 
Notes that Irish stones were at one time common in the 
Northumbrian dales, and in high repute as a charm to 
keep frogs, snakes, and other vermin from entering the 
possessor’s house. Evidently the blessing bestowed by 
St. Patrick upon the Emerald Isle was supposed to dwell 
in its very stones. Mr. Denham describes one of these 
stones, which belonged to Mr. Thomas Hedley, son to a

gentleman of the same name, at Woolaw, in Redesdale. 
It was of a pale-blue colour, three-and-a-quarter inches 
in diameter, and three-quarters of an inch thick. It is 
not perforated, and therein differs from the holy or self- 
bored stones of the North.! 
A curious aid to the rearing of cattle came lately to 
the knowledge of Mr. G. W , a gentleman of the city 
of Durham. During an excursion of a few miles into 
the country, he observed a sort of rigging attached to 
the chimney of a farmhouse well known to him, and 
asked what it meant. The good wife told him that they 
had experienced great difficulty that year in rearing 
their calves ; the poor little creatures all died off, so 
that they had taken the leg and thigh of one of the dead 
calves, and hung it in a chimney by a rope, since which 
they had not lost another calf.? 
It is strange to find the custom of lighting ‘ need-   
1 As to this later description of stone, however, we often come across 
it in the folk lore of the whole of England. Self-bored stones are con- 
sidered charms against witcheraft, and they keep away nightmare both 
from man and beast. They are therefore suspended at the head of the 
bed as well as in stables. I have heard of this belief in the North of 
England, and also in Suffolk and in Cornwall, 
2 J have often observed in the Weald of Sussex dead horses or calves 
hung up by the four legs to the horizontal branch of a tree. . It is a 
sufficiently ghastly sight. A magnificent elm in Westmeston, just 
under the Ditchling Beacon, was constantly loaded with dead animals: 
one spring I saw two horses and three calves. .I never could ascertain 
the reason of this strange custom, further than that it was thought lucky 
for the cattle. I have no doubt myself that they were a sacrifice to Odin, 
hanging being the manner in which offerings were made to him. Odin 
himself on one occasion is said to have hung between heaven and earth. 
It was customary for the ancient Germanic tribes to hang upon trees the 
heads of the horses which had been killed in battle, as offerings to. the 
god. When Cxcina visited the scene of Varian’s overthrow (4.p. 15), he 
saw horses’ heads hanging to the trees in the neighbourhood of the altars, 
where the Roman tribunes and centurions had been slaughtered.—

fires,’ on the occasion of epidemics among cattle, still 
lingering among us, but so it is. The Vicar of Stam- 
fordham writes thus respecting it: ‘ When the murrain 
broke out among the cattle about eighteen years ago, 
this fire was produced by rubbing two pieces of dry 
wood together, and was carried from place to place all 
through this district, as a charm against cattle taking 
the disease. Bonfires were kindled with it, and the 
cattle driven into the smoke, where they were kept for 
some time. Many farmers hereabouts, I am informed, 
had the need-fire” And Mr. Denham relates that his 
father, who died a.p. 1843, in his 79th year, perfectly 
remembered a great number of persons, belonging to the 
upper and middle classes, from his native parish of 
Bowes, assembling on the banks of the River Greta to 
work for need-fire, a murrain among cattle being then 
prevalent in that part of Yorkshire. The fire was pro- 
duced by the violent and continuous friction of two 
pieces of wood; and if cattle passed through the smoke 
‘thus raised, their cure was looked upon as certain. 
‘The north-country proverb, ‘to work as if working for 
need-fire,’ shows how prevalent this custom has been in 
the Border counties, as in Scotland. That it is of very 
ancient origin, and widely spread, Mr. Kelly shows.! 
Originally, the mystic fire was originated by the friction 
of a wooden axle in the nave of a waggon-wheel, all 
the fires in the adjacent houses having been previously 
extinguished. Every household furnished its quota 
of straw, heath, and brushwood for fuel, laying it 
down altogether in some part of a narrow lane. When 
the fire thus made was burned down sufficiently, 
the cattle were all forcibly driven through it, two 
or three times, in order, beginning with the swine,

and eénding with the horses, or vice vers Then 
each householder took home an extinguished brand, 
which, in some districts, was placed in the manger; 
and, finally, the ashes: were scattered to the winds, 
that their health-giving influence might be spread 
far and near. It is on record also that a heifer has 
been sacrificed on this occasion. 
In the fire-giving wheel Mr. Kelly sees an emblem 
of the sun, and in the whole ceremonies of the need-fire 
the remains of an ancient and solemn religious rite, 
handed down from early pagan times. 
Some of the above narrations make mention of 
charms uttered over a wounded or diseased part of the 
body, but I have not been able to learn the words 
spoken. Two charms have, however, been sent me from 
the neighbourhood of Dartmoor, in Devonshire, where 
they are held in high esteem. The first was repeated 
over the upper nurse in the family of the then Vicar of 
North Bovey, after a hurt by a fish-bone, in September 
1860, and has the credit of curing her: 
*When our Lord Jesus Christ was upon earth, He 
pricked himself with a [here name the cause of the 
injury], and the blood sprang up to heaven. Yet His 
flesh did neither canker, mould, rot, nor corrupt; no 
more shall thine. I put my trust in God. In the

old copy of Gould’s Poems, but I do not know to what county it belongs: 
‘When Jesus went up to the Cross to be crucified, the Jews asked Him,

reticent, We may mention here that this sort of charm 
is much used in Prussia by persons of a higher station 
in life than those who resort to them in any part of 
England. A friend informs me that in a family at 
Berlin, of more than average education and cultivation 
of mind, she has heard a lady blamed for persisting in 
consulting the doctor for chronic rheumatism in the 
arm, instead of having the limb ‘ besprochen.’ 
In the North of England, at any rate, charms and 
spells are not, however, all spent upon the sick and 
wounded. Witness the following dialogue between two 
servant-girls in the city of Durham, communicated to 
me by the Rev. James Raine. One of them, it seems, 
peeped out of curiosity into the box of her fellow- 
servant, and was astonished to find there the end of a

recited the following verse :—   
It’s not this candle alone I stick, 
But A. B.’s heart I mean to prick ; 
‘Whether he be asleep or awake, 
Y'd have him come to me and speak. 
By the time the candle burned down to the pins and 
went out, the lover would be certain to present himself. 
The nurse declared that she knew three instances in 
which this spell had been practised, and that success- 
fully, so far as the appearance of the lover was concerned; 
but only one of the girls was married to the man in ques- 
tion, and her after-life was most unhappy. Of the other 
two, one lost her sweetheart immediately. He came to 
her that evening because he could not help himself, but 
he came in a very ill-humour, declaring that he knew 
the girl ‘had been about some devilment or other.’ 
‘No tongue,’ he said, ‘could tell what she had made him 
suffer, and he never would have another word to say 
to her from that hour. 
It is interesting to compare this history with the 
following, from the neighbourhood of the Hartz Moun-: 
tains. In that district girls obtain a glimpse of their 
future husbands in the following manner. At nightfall 
a maiden must shut herself up in her sleeping-room, 
take off all her clothes, and place upon a table, covered 
with a white cloth, two beakers, the one filled with wine,
-P-A-G-E-168

the other with pure water. She must then repeat the 
following words :— 
My dear St. Andrew, 
Let now appear before me 
My heart’s beloved ; 
If he shall be rich, 
He will pour a cup of wine; 
If he shall be poor, 
Let him pour a cup of water. 
This done, the form of the future husband will appear, 
and drink from one of the cups. If poor he will sip 
the water, if rich the wine. 
An over-curious maiden once summoned her future . 
husband in this manner. Precisely as the clock struck 
twelve he appeared, drank from the wine-cup, laid a 
three-edged dagger on the table, and vanished. The 
girl put the dagger in her trunk. Some years after- 
wards a man arrived in that place from a distant part 
~ of the country, bought property there, saw the girl, and 
married her. It was the same whose form had appeared 
to her that night. After a time he chanced to open 
his wife’s trunk, and there beheld the dagger. At the 
sight of it he became furious. ‘Thou, then, art the 
woman,’ he exclaimed, ‘ who, years ago, forced me to 
come hither from afar in the night, and it was no 
dream! Die, therefore!’ and with these words he. 
thrust the dagger in her heart. 
A variation of this spell extends into Yorkshire, and 
was thus practised by a young woman at Wakefield, not 
long ago. She obtained the bladebone of a shoulder of 
mutton, and into its thinnest part drove a new pen- 
knife; then'she went secretly into the garden, and buried 
knife and bone together, firmly believing that so long

as they were in the ground her betrothed would be in 
a state of uneasiness, which would gradually increase 
till he would be compelled to visit her. In this case his 
powers of endurance were not very great, for he arrived 
the next day, saying how wretched and miserable he 
had been ever since yesterday. The girl was thus 
firmly convinced of the potency of the spell, but, at the 
same time, she had been so uncomfortable while practis- 
ing it, and her conscience pricked her so sharply for the 
sufferings she had inflicted on her lover, that she deter- 
mined never to-have recourse to it again. 
- But this is not all. Local superstition interferes in 
a yet more delicate matter—the quarrels of husband 
and wife—as the following narration shows, which was 
communicated to me by my kind neighbour and 
friend, Mrs. W. :— 
About the year 1825, there lived at Bothal, in Cum- 
berland, a farmer named Billy Briscoe, who had married 
a widow, and a wealthy one for that part of the country, 
since her fortune was £60 a year. But, unfortunately, 
she had also a strong will and high temper; and as his 
were -of the same character, the match did not prove 
a happy one. The ill-assorted couple were always quar- 
relling. If anything went amiss in the house or the 
farm, the husband at once threw the blame on his wife, 
who for her part was never at a loss for an angry retort. 
Things had gone on for some time in this wretched way, 
when in despair the husband applied to a wise woman 
for a charm, to protect him from his wife’s evil eye; and 
on receipt of a guinea she gave him two pieces of paper, 
each about three inches square, closely covered with 
writing, directing that one piece should be sewn inside 
his waistcoat, and the other fastened within the cup- 
board door. This was done, and the change that ensued

was wonderful. All was peace and goodwill. The cat 
and dog were transformed into a pair of turtledoves. 
But the harmony was, unhappily, of no long duration. 
After a-few months the waistcoat was thoughtlessly 
popped into the washtub, and the charm disappeared 
among the suds, while about the same time its counter- 
part was swept off the cupboard door during a grand 
house-cleaning. The spell was broken ; peace was over, 
and the home more miserable than ever. The unhappy 
wife told all this to my informant, who, as a last re- 
source, asked her why she did not go back to her own 
friends, since she could not make her husband happy. 
“T’ve thought of that,’ she replied; ‘but my money’s 
here, and how could I go away and leave other people 
to eat my meat?”

Wrircucrart undoubtedly lies at the root of many of 
the practices recorded in the last chapter, but we must 
now deal with it more directly, The belief in this 
evil power, once universal throughout Christendom, 
took deep hold of the Borderland, especially of the 
Scottish portion of it. It is curious to observe how Mr. 
Wilkie speaks of witches, as though they were recog- 
nised members of society, to be met and spoken with 
every day. Thus, he begins abruptly: ‘There is some 
difficulty in knowing how to act when a witch offers to 
shake hands with us. No doubt there is some risk in 
accepting the courtesy, since the action entails on us all 
the ill she may wish us. Still it, ensures us equally all 
the good she may wish us, and therefore it seems a pity 
to refuse one’s hand. It is, however, unlucky to be 
praised by a witch, or indeed to hold any conversation 
with her, and our only safety against sudden death soon 
after consists in having the last word. Hence the old 
phrase, “Some witch or other has shaken hands wi’ 
him, and gotten the last word.” Should you receive
-P-A-G-E-172
144 WITCHCRAFT. 
money from a witch, put it at once into your mouth, 
for fear the donor should spirit it away, and supply its 
place with a round stone or slate, which otherwise she 
might do at pleasure. Accordingly, it may be observed 
that old people constantly put into their mouths the 
money which is paid them.’ 
To draw blood above the mouth from the person who 
has caused any witchery is the accredited mode of break- 
ing the spell. The Rev. J. F. Bigge has recorded the 
following instance: A tenant of Sir Charles Monck, 
living at Belsay-bankfoot, had so many mischances that 
he felt no doubt his stock was bewitched. A cow 
broke her leg, a calf died, a horse got: stuck, and so on. 
Who was his enemy? At last he settled that it must 
be a new servant of his own, quite a young lad, and by 
the advice of a skilled person he determined to break 
the spell, by drawing blood above the wizard’s mouth. 
So at foddering-time the farmer purposely quarrelled 
with the poor lad about some trifle, and flying upon 
him, scratched his face and made his nose bleed. The 
plan was considered quite a success, for no further mis- 
fortune happened to the stock. 
A story which has been communicated to me from 
Cheriton Bishop, a village ten miles from Exeter, cor- 
responds singularly with this Northumbrian tale. A 
belief in witchcraft still holds its ground in that part of 
Devonshire. Not many years ago a young girl in deli- 
cate health was thought to have been bewitched by an 
old woman of the place, and all declared that the only 
eure for her would be an application of the witch’s blood. 
The girl’s friends, therefore, laid wait for the poor old 
woman, seized her when she was alone and unprotected, 
scratched her with a nail till the blood flowed, and col- 
lected the blood. They carried it home, and smeared the

sick girl with it, and therecovery, which took place in 
course of time, was attributed to this application.! 
There are still plenty of white witches in Devonshire, 
but one died a few years ago in the village of Bovey 
Tracey, who, unless she were greatly maligned, by no 
means deserved so favourable a designation. She was 
accused of ‘ overlooking’ her neighbours’ pigs, so that 
her son, if ever betrayed into a quarrel with her, used 
always to say before they parted, ‘ Mother, mother, spare 
my pigs.’ This son, a farm-labourer living in the ad- 
joining parish of Hennock, came to avery remarkable 
end. While leading a cart through the River Teign, he 
stopped to rest his horse; and while arranging some- 
thing about the cart, it turned over upon him, so that he 
was imprisoned in the water and drowned. Neighbours 
remembered that he had ‘had words’ with his mother, 
when last they met, and were not slow in laying his 
death to her charge. But the most awful story about 
her is as follows. A man went to her asking for help, to 
get rid of an enemy. The witch gave him a candle, and 
told him to take it into a secret place, light it, and 
watch it while it was burning. So long as it burned, 
his enemy would be in flames; when it expired he would 
die, which, said my informant, came to pass.” 
1 Note that this is the case with werewolves also. In Brittany, if the 
lycanthropist be scratched above the nose, so that three blood drops are 
extracted, the charm is broken. In Germany the werewolf has to be 
stabbed with knife or pitchfork thrice on the brows before it can be dis- 
enchanted.—S, B. G. 
2 At Hurstpierpoint there is a cottage in which lived a witch, of 
whom it was said she could not die till she had sold her secret, Her end 
was dreadful. She was dying for weeks. At last an old man from 
Cuckfield Workhouse paid a halfpenny for the secret, and she died with 
the money in her hand, A blue flame appeared on the roof as she 
breathed her last. | 
‘The mother of a man whom I know was struck dumb by this. witch, 
L

- “One of the most common misdeeds of witches is to 
hinder the dairymaid in butter-making. When the 
butter fails to come in the churn as usual, it is at. once 
set down as bewitched, and, curiously enough, this belief 
extends to Devonshire, though butter is there made 
without churning. A gentleman of that county in- 
forms me that he perfectly remembers how, when he 
was a child, the dairymaid would run to his mother 
and say, ‘ Please, ma’am, to send somebody else to make 
the butter; [ve been stirring the cream ever so long, 
and the butter won’t come, and I know it’s bewitched.’ 
In Lancashire the witch is driven away by putting a 
hot iron into the churn, in Northumberland by popping 
in a crooked sixpence. In Cleveland they keep her 
off thus. Before churning take a pinch of salt, and 
throw it into the churn; then a second pinch, and throw 
it into the fire, and so on, nine times each way. Your 
butter will then come without fail. 
The following story was told to the Rev. George 
Ornsby, by an old man who used to work in the vicarage 
garden at Fishlake. A few years ago the old man was 
applied to by the tailor of the neighbouring village for 
two small branches from a mountain ash, which grew in 
his garden. Enquiry being made why they were wanted, 
the applicant stated that his wife had been churning 
for hours, and yet no butter would come; that they 
believed the cream was bewitched; and that they had. 
The hag was wont to mumble as she walked along, and this. woman 
asked her one day what curses she was muttering, whereupon she was 
struck dumb. At the end of three months the relations interfered, and 
~ persuaded the old woman to take off the charm. So she told her victim 
to walk to Sevenoaks, in Kent, where at the park-gate she would meet a 
man in black, and then and there recover her speech, which accordingly 
came to pass. I have heard this story corroborated by several persons, 
—SBLG
-P-A-G-E-175
WITCHCRAFT IN THE DAIRY. 147 
heard say, that if the cream were stirred with one twig 
of mountain ash, and the cow beaten with the other, 
the charm would be broken, and the butter come 
without delay. 
On the Borders, if you suspect a woman of bewitching 
your cow and hindering the butter from coming, order 
the dairymaid to press down the churn-staff to the 
bottom of the churn, and keep it there. The witch 
will be drawn to your house, enter it, and sit down 
without power to rise. Now you are mistress of the 
occasion. Tax her with her guilt, and make her pro+ 
mise to let your butter come. This done, you may 
permit her to rise and go away, which she will do at 
once, making many protestations of innocence. -In, 
North Germany, too, they believe that if the butter does 
not come the dairy is bewitched, but the remedy there 
is to smoke the cows, churns, and pails, in secret and at 
nightfall. This will bring the witch to the door, 
asking admittance, but she must on no account be let 
in? 
1 Sec Thorpe's Mythology, vol. iti. p. 64.—At Bratton-Clovelly, in 
Devonshire, a farmer's cows were charmed, so that his milk yielded 
neither cream nor butter. He declared on oath that he had put whole 
faggots on the fire, but the milk would not boil, a proof that it was 
bewitched. He therefore resorted to the white witch at Exeter, who 
advised him to make a fire with sticks gathered out of four parishes, and 
set the milk upon them. The witch would thereupon look in at the 
door or window, and the charm would be broken, The man did as 
ordered, collecting wood from the parishes of Lewtrenchard, Germans- 
week, Broadwood Wigger, and Thurshelton. As soon as the milk was 
placed on the fire thus made, it boiled over; the witch peeped in at 
the window and muttered something, then went away, and the charm 
was broken.— 8. B. G. 
It is curious to trace something analogous in Swedish folk-lore. If on 
Midsummer Eve nine kinds of wood are collected, and formed into a pile 
and kindled, and some witch’s butter cast upon it, or if the fire be only 
beaten with nine kinds of wood, witches are foreed to come forward and’ 
discover themselves—(Thorpe’s Mythology, vol, ii. p, 106.)

148 WITCHCRAFT. 
The difficulty in churning milk, however, proceeds 
most commonly from the cow having been struck by an 
elf-stone, while grazing in the field. However much 
the poor creature may suffer from the wound, no 
human eye will see it till she has been rubbed all over 
with the blue bonnet belonging to the chief of the 
family, or to some very aged man. The wound, or its 
scar, if the mischief be of old date, will then be plainly 
seen. 
The elf-stone is described as sharp, and with 
many corners and points, so that whichever way it 
falls, it inflicts a wound on the animal it touches. 
Popular belief maintains that the elves received these 
stones from old fairies, who wore them as breastpins at 
the fairy court, and that the old fairies received them 
in turn from mermaidens. Such is Mr. Wilkie’s ac- 
count of the matter. Doubtless they are really the 
flint arrow-heads of our ancestors. Mr. Denham main- 
tains this, and describes them as formed of flint about 
an inch long and half an inch broad. Irish peasants 
wear them about their necks, set in silver, as an amulet 
against elf-shooting. He adds that the disease, said to 
be produced by an elf-shot, consists really in an over- 
distension of the cow’s first stomach, from eating to 
excess clover and grass with the morning dew upon it. 
Mention is made of elf-stones in the confession of 
Isabel Gowdie, who was tried for witchcraft in April 
1662, and afterwards executed. She declared that the 
elves formed them from the rough flint, the archfiend 
himself perfecting or ‘dighting’ them; and she gave 
the names of many persons, whom she and her comrades 
had slain with them, stating that whoever failed to 
bless himself when the little whirlwind passed which
-P-A-G-E-177
BLF-SHOOTING. 149 
accompanied their locomotion, fell under their power, 
and they had the right of shooting at him.! 
Mr. Wilkie records that a few years ago a plough- 
man in Ettrick Forest was said to have obtained an elf- 
stone thus. While ploughing a field, he heard a whiz- 
zing sound in the air, and looking up perceived a stone 
aimed at one of his horses. He drove on, and it fell by 
the animal’s side. He stopped and picked up the stone, 
but found its angles so sharp that they cut his hand as 
it lay there, though the weight of the stone was only 
one ounce troy. - 
The belief in elf-shooting extends, or has extended, 
from the Shetland Islands to Cornwall.2 In the Shet- 
Jand Islands a charm is repeated over the wounded 
creature, while a sewing needle, wrapped in a leaf of the 
Psalter, is fastened into some part of her hair. Else- 
where the cow was made to drink water in which an 
elf-stone had been washed. Another mode of relief, 
called the ‘ordeal of blood,’ is prescribed in Scotland. 
Take some of the injured animal’s blood, mix with it a 
1 Scott's Demonology, Letter V. 
2 Elf-shooting is, in fact, an ancient Scandinavian superstition. In 
the ‘Bandamanna Saga,’ an Icelandic account of a law-feud. in the lith 
contury, oceurs the following passage: ‘That same autumn, Hermund 
gathered a party and went along the Hvrammstrack on his way to Borg, 
intending to burn down the house with Egil in it. Now, as they came 
out under Volfell, they heard the chime of a bowstring up in the fell; 
and at the moment Hermund felt ill, and a sharp pain under his arms, 
s0 that they had to turn about, and the sickness gained on him. When 
they reached Thorgautsstede, they had to lift him down from his horse, 
and they sent after the priest at Sidumuli. When he arrived, Hermund 
could not speak, and the priest remained with him. After awhile his 
lips moved, and the priest bending over him heard him say, ‘T'wo hun- 
dred in the gill! Two hundred in the gill!’ and so muttering he died, 
(Bandamanna Saga, p. 41). This is one of the earliest accounts of an 
elf-shot I know. In the old Norse ballad of Sir Olaf, the Emaid strikes 
the hunter on the heart and he dies.—S, B, G.
-P-A-G-E-178

quantity of pins, and boil it, taking care to stir it as 
soon as it begins to boil. The door must be carefully 
locked, and everyone kept out of the secret, except the 
members of the family. Presently the witch who has 
done the evil will come to the house-door, and ask to be 
let in; but you must take care not to admit her, for if 
she enters she will murder everyone concerned in the 
ordeal. Instead of opening the door, you must insist 
on her promising to take off the spell, after which you 
may admit her freely. 
The following account of elf-shooting in County Derry 
is furnished by my Irish correspondent. The elves, she 
says, are considered bad jealous sprites, who envy the pea~ 
sants all their little comforts, and especially their rough 
mountain cows, with the milk and butter they yield. 
Therefore the elves delight to injure the milch-cows. 
At dead of night, it is firmly believed, will an elf often 
enter the byre, and shoot a small sharp Stone, rather 
bigger than a pea, under and behind the left shoulder of 
the cow.. Next morning the owner finds his cow lying 
down, breathing heavily, with the sweat running down 
its eyes and nose from pain, and he knows she has been 
elf-shot. So off he goes for the old man of the county 
who is skilled in healing cows. The old man comes 
‘travelling’ (4.¢. on foot), it may be, many miles, and all 
are awed: in his presence. He clears the room and 
makes his preparations. In a new clean pot he boils a 
pound of gunpowder and a crooked sixpence in a pint 
of water, and then carries the mixture to the byre and 
places it before the cow. She drinks it at once, well 
knowing it is her only hope of cure. The gunpowder 
immediately blows the elf-stone out again through the 
hole under the ‘shoulder, and the sixpence, fitting on the 
heart, covers the wound made there by the stone. The

i doctor returns into the house with the stone in his hand, 
to be well praised and well paid. ‘Should anyone pre- 
sent indulge in impertinent dot he will take care 
to keep them to bimself, for fear Wis cows should be 
blinked’ by the skilled man, and everybody believes in 
blinking. This is casting an evil eye on a cow, a less 
evil certainly than elf-shooting, because itis a human, not 
a spirit curse, but still troublesome, since the old man 
must be summoned'and paid. When a cow has been 
blinked, the old man cures her by muttering a charm 
over her, making the sign of the cross over her back and 
down each leg, and pouring down her throat a compound 
of epsom-salts, castor-oil, saltpetre, and sulphur. It 
is useless, to argue against these superstitions. If after 
the skilled man’s treatment for elf-shooting the cow 
will not recover, she dies because God chooses it, and 
not from the elf-shot. 
When a child pines or wastes away, the cause is com- 
monly looked for in witchcraft or the ‘evil eye. At 
Stamfordham a sickly puny child is set down as ‘ heart- 
grown’ or bewitched, and is treated as follows. Before 
sunrise it is brought to a blacksmith of the seventh 
generation, and laid naked on the anvil. The smith 
raises his hammer, as if he were about to strike hot iron, 
but brings it down gently on the child’s body. This is 
done three times, and the child is sure to thrive from 
that day. 
In the North-west of Scotland, according to Dr. 
Mitchell, the ‘gold and silver water’ is the accredited 
cure for a child suffering from an evil eye. A shilling 
and a sovereign are put into water, which is then 
sprinkled over the patient in the name of the Trinity. 
An eminent physician of Sunderland, the late Dr. 
Johnson, wrote to-me thus respecting a little sufferer
-P-A-G-E-180
152 , > WITCHORAFT; 
” of that town, only four days before his own death: A 
case of necromancy occurred in this town some months 
ago. A child se eighteen months old, belonging to 
a working-man at\ Southwick, was suffering from the 
wasting which accompanies scrofulous disease of the 
bowels, and presented the withered, haggard, weird 
appearance attributed to those smitten by the witch’s 
evil eye, or to the fairies’ changelings. The parents 
firmly believed the former to be the case, and sought 
counsel of a reputed charmer (Irish, I think) yet living 
in this town. He told them to come at midnight with 
the child to a room occupied by himself; and there a 
magic circle was drawn, lighted by candles placed round 
the circumference, and ornamented by chalk drawings, 
supposed by the people to be representations of planets. 
He took the naked child in his arms, stepped within 
the circle, repeated something (alleged to be the Lord’s 
Prayer backwards) three times over, anointed the breast 
and forehead of the child with some mysterious unguent, 
waved a magic wand over its head, addressed a sort of 
patron angel or imp in its behalf, and then pronounced 
the child whole and taken from under the evil spell. 
I find that a part of this superstition refers to a belief 
that the parents of sick children employ the “evil eye” 
to transfer the disease from their own to other children, 
as well as. to gratify malice or revenge. Within the 
last month a charge was seriously preferred against an 
elderly female for bewitching a child, about whom I was 
consulted ; and there seemed to bea floating belief in 
the minds of the parents that the “evil eye” had been 
cast upon it, not only because the witch had quarrelled 
with the father, but because, her own pigs being un- 
healthy, she had sought to transfer the sickness from her’ 
own stye to her neighbour’s nursery.’
-P-A-G-E-181
(CHANGELINGS. 153 
Even in our own country, it appears that the fairies 
share with the witches the odium of molesting our 
nurseries. In the Western Islands idiots are believed to 
be without doubt changelings of the fairies. Dr. Mitchell 
knew of three such cases, and he records the only means 
of redress there open to the parents. If they place the 
changeling on the beach, below highwater-mark, when 
the tide is out, and pay no heed to its screams, the 
fairies, rather than suffer their offspring to be drowned 
by the rising waters, will convey it away and restore the 
child they bad stolen. The sign that this has been 
effected is the cessation of the child’s crying. 
Danish folk-lore speaks much of these changelings, 
which the underground folk substitute for human children 
before their baptism, if the lights are extinguished in the 
lying-in chamber. Once, the room being darkened to 
give the mother sleep, and the baby considered safe in 
its father’s arms, he dozed off for a few minutes, and 
awoke with a child in each arm and a tall woman 
standing before him. The woman vanished, and he 
was left in terrible perplexity as to which was his own 
child. By the advice of the priest, the two infants were 
laid upon the ground, and a wild stallion colt led up to 
them. The creature licked the one but snorted at the 
other, and strove to kick it, on which a tall woman 
appeared, caught up the false child, and ran away with it. 
Two methods of getting rid of such changelings are 
recorded. One mother, who was greatly distressed at 
the loss of her own child and the substitution of a puny 
wretched creature, at length heated her oven very hot, 
and having instructed her servant-maid to ask, in a very 
loud voice, ‘ Why do you heat the oven so hot, mistress?” 
replied, ‘I am going to burn my child.’ The question 
was asked and answered three times; then she took the
-P-A-G-E-182
154 WITCHCRAFT. 
changeling and put it on the peel, as if to thrust it in 
the oven. At this moment the underground woman 
rushed in, took her child from the peel, and returned 
the other, saying, ‘ There is your child! I have done 
by it better than you have by mine.’ And, in fact, the 
baby was thriving and strong. In the other case a 
pudding was made of pork, with skin, hair, and all mixed 
up in it. When this was placed before the changeling 
he exclaimed, as he eyed it for some time, ‘Pudding 
with hide and pudding with hair, pudding with eyes and 
pudding with bones in it. Thrice have I seen a young 
wood spring up on Tiis lake, but never before did I see 
such a pudding! The fiend wili stay here no longer? 
So saying, he turned and went away. In each instance 
it is specified that the change of children was effected 
because the parents had been negligent in bringing the 
infants to be christened.! 
But to return to witchcraft proper. The Wilkie MS. 
is rich in stories on this subject. Witches and warlocks, 
it seems, are wont to kindle their fires in deep glens, on

dance or sit in a ring, and hold converse while they 
devour the plunder of rifled graves with the choicest 
wines from their neighbours’ cellars. Now, some years 
back, the blacksmith of Yarrowfoot had for apprentices 
two brothers, both steady lads,and, when bound to him, 
fine healthy fellows. After a few months, however, the 
younger of the two began to grow pale and lean, lose 
his appetite, and show other marks of declining health, 
His brother, much concerned, often questioned him as 
to what ailed him, but to no purpose. At last, how- 
ever, the poor lad burst into an agony of tears, and con- 
fessed that he was quite worn-out, and should soon be

brought to the grave through the illusage of his mis+ 
tress, who was in truth a witch, though none suspected 
it. ‘Every night” he sobbed out, ‘she comes to my 
bedside, puts a magic bridle on me, and changes me 
into a horse. Then, seated on my back, she urges me on 
for many a mile to the wild moors, where she and I 
know not what other vile creatures hold their hideous 
feasts. There she keeps me all night, and at. early 
morning I carry her home. She takes off my bridle, 
and there I am, but so weary I can ill stand. And thus 
I pass my nights while you are soundly sleeping.’ 
The elder brother at once declared he would take 
his chance of a night among the witches, so he put the 
younger one in his own place next the wall, and lay 
awake himself till the usual time of the witch-woman’s 
arrival. She came, bridle in hand, and flinging it over 
the elder brother’s head, up sprang a fine hunting 
horse. The lady leaped on his back, and started for 
the trysting-place, which on this occasion, as it chanced, 
was the cellar of a neighbouring laird. 
While she and the rest of the vile crew were regaling 
themselves with claret and sack, the hunter, who was 
left in a spare stall of the stable, rubbed and rubbed his 
head against the wall till he loosened the bridle, and 
finally got it off, on which he recovered his human 
form. Holding the bridle firmly in his hand he con- 
cealed himself at the back of the stall till his mistress 
came within reach, when in an instant he flung the 
mnagic bridle over her head, and, behold, a fine grey mare ! 
He mounted her and dashed off, riding through 
hedge and ditch, till, looking down, he perceived she 
had lost a shoe from one of her forefeet, He took her 
to the first smithy that was open, had the shoe replaced, 
and a new one put on the other forefoot, and then rode

her up and down a ploughed field till she was nearly 
worn-out, At last he took her home, and pulled the 
bridle off just in time for her to creep into bed before 
her husband awoke, and got up for his day’s.work. 
The honest blacksmith arose, little thinking what had. 
been going on all night; but his wife complained of 
being very ill, almost dying, and begged him to send 
for a doctor. He accordingly aroused his apprentices ; 
the elder one went out, and soon returned with one 
whom he had chanced to meet already abroad. The 
doctor wished to feel his patient’s pulse, but she reso- 
lutely hid her hands, and refused to show them. The 
village Esculapius was perplexed ; but the husband, 
impatient at her obstinacy, pulled off the bed-clothes, 
and found, to his horror, that horseshoes were tightly 
nailed to both hands! On further examination, her 
sides appeared galled with kicks, the same that the ap- 
prentice had given her during his ride up and down the 
ploughed field. 
The brothers now came forward, and related all that 
had passed. On the following day the witch was tried 
by the magistrates of Selkirk, and condemned to be 
burned to death on a stone at the Bullsheugh, a sentence 
which was promptly carried into effect.. It isadded that 
the younger apprentice was at last restored to health by 
eating butter made from the milk of cows fed in kirk- 
yards, a sovereign remedy for consumption brought on 
through being witch-ridden. 
A similar story is told in Iceland, and is translated in 
Poweli’s ‘ Legends of Iceland,’ p. 85. It appears again 
in Belgium in the following form :— 
At a large farm at Bollebeck dwelt a serving-man, 
who, though well-fed by the farmer’s wife, grew thinner 
every day. His fellow-servants questioned him as to

the cause of this, but to no purpose, till at length the 
shepherd, who was his best friend, drew the following 
history from him. His mistress was a witch, and used 
to come at night to his bedside, throw a bridle over his 
head, turn him into a horse, and ride him about all 
night. ‘This seems to me incredible,’ said the shep- 
herd; ‘but let me lie in thy bed to-night. I should 
like to try the thing for once.’ The man agreed, and 
the shepherd took his place in bed, 
About ten o'clock the farmer’s wife came in, and would 
have thrown the bridle over him, but the shepherd was 
too quick for her. He snatched it out of her hand 
and threw it over her, on which she was instantly 
changed into a mare. He rode her about the fields all 
night,then brought her home and led her to the farmer, 
saying,‘ Master, there is a horsedealer in the village who 
wishes to dispose of this mare, and asks five hundred 
francs for her,” ‘She is sold,’ said the farmer ; ‘come 
in, and I will give thee the money.’ ‘ But it’s without 
the bridle,’ said the shepherd ; ‘he requires to have 
that back.’ ‘ Be it so,’ said the farmer, laughing ; ‘ the 
bargain stands,’ He counted out the money, the shep- 
herd pocketed it, then took off the bridle, and, behold! 
the woman stood before them. Shedding bitter tears, 
she fell at her husband’s feet, promising never again 
to do the like, on which he forgave her, and the 
shepherd was bound over to secrecy.! 
The Danish version of the story is slightly different. 
In it the victim is unconscious of the cause of his 
declining health and strength, till he learns it from a 
wise man. The wise man gave him an ointment to 
apply to his head at night. The tingling it produced 
awoke him, and, lo! he was standing outside Tron

Church in Norway, with a bridle in his hand. He had 
torn it off in scratching his head. He flung the bridle 
over his mistress, transformed her into a handsome 
mare, rode her home, had four new shoes fastened on 
her, sold her to her husband; and taking off the bridle, 
there she stood, with horseshoes nailed to her hands 
and feet.. The indignant husband turned her out-of- 
doors, and she never was able to free herself from the 
iron shoes.! 
The next story relates how the miller of Holdean 
Mill, Berwickshire, received some uncannie visitants, of 
what precise nature it does not specify. It is to this 
effect. While the miller was drying a melder of oats, 
belonging to a neighbouring farmer, tired with the 
fatigues of the day, he threw himself down upon some 
straw in the kiln-barn, and soon fell fast asleep. After a 
time he was awakened by a confused noise, as if the 
killogee were full of people, all speaking together; on 
which he pulled aside the straw from the banks of the 
kiln, and, looking down, observed a number of feet and 
legs paddling among the ashes, as if enjoying the warmth 
from the searcely extinguished fires, As he listened, 
he distinctly heard the words, ‘What think ye o’ my 
feeties ?—a second voice answering, ‘ An’ what think ye 
o’ mine?’ Nothing daunted, though much astonished, the 
stout-hearted miller took uphis ‘beer mell,’ alarge wooden 
hammer, and threw it down among them, so that the 
ashes flew about; while he cried out with a loud voice, 
‘ What think ye o’ my meikle mell amang a’ thae legs 0’ 
yourn ?’ A hideous rout at once emerged from the kiln 
amid yells and cries, which passed into wild laughter ; 
and finally these words reached the miller’s ears, sung 
in a mocking tone:

A man named Ronaldson, who lived at the village of 
Bowden, is reported to have had frequent encounters 
with the witches of that place. Among these we find the 
following. One morning at sunrise, while he was tying 
his garter with one foot against a low dyke, he was 
startled at feeling something like a rope of straw passed 
between his legs, and himself borne swiftly away upon. 
it to a small brook at the foot of the southernmost hill 
of Eildon. Hearing a hoarse smothered laugh, he per- 
ceived he was in the power of witches or sprites; and 
when he came to a ford called the Brig-o’-stanes, 
feeling his foot touch a large stone, he exclaimed, ‘I’ the 
name o’ the Lord, ye’se get me no farther! At that 
moment the rope broke, the air rang as with the laugh- 
ter of a thousand voices; and as he kept his footing on 
the stone, he heard a muttered cry, ‘Ah, we've lost 
the eoof? 
This adventure reminds us how the ancestor of the 
Duffus family was spirited away from his paternal 
fields, and found the next day at Paris, in the royal 
cellars, with a silvercup in his hand. In that case, how- - 
ever, the victim provoked his destiny by echoing the 
ery of ‘ Horse and hattock,’ the elfin signal for mount- 
ing and riding off. ‘

secluded districts, for tailors to leave their workshops 
and go into the farmhouses of the neighbourhood to 
work by the day. The farmer’s wife of Deloraine thus 
engaged a tailor with his workmen and apprentices for 
the day, begging them to come in good time in the 
morning. They did so, and partook of the family break- 
fast of porridge and milk. During the meal, one of 
the apprentices observed that the milk-jug was almost 
empty, on which the mistress slipt out of the back-door 
with a basin in her hand to get a fresh supply. The 
lad’s curiosity was roused, for he had heard there was 
no more milk in the house; so he crept after her, bid 
himself behind the door, and saw her turn a pin in the 
wall, on which a stream of pure milk flowed into the 
basin. She twirled the pin, and the milk stopped. 
Coming back, she presented the tailors with the bowl of 
milk, and they gladly washed down the rest of their 
porridge with it. 
About noon, while our tailors were busily engaged 
with the gudeman’s wardrobe, one of them complained 
of thirst, and wished for a bowl of milk like the morn- 
ing’s. ‘Is thata’?’ said the apprentice ; * ye’se get that’ 
The mistress was out of the way, so he left his work, 
found his way to the spot he had marked in the morn- 
ing, twirled the pin, and quickly filled a basin. But, 
alas! he could not then stay the stream. Twist the 
pin as he would, the milk still continued to flow. He 
called the other lads, and implored them to come and 
help him; but they could only bring such tubs and 
buckets as they found in the kitchen, and these were 
soon filled. When the confusion was at its height, the 
mistress appeared among them, looking as black as 
thunder ; while she called out, in a mocking voice, ‘ A’ye 
loons! ye hae drawn a’ the milk fra every coo between

the head o’ Yarrow an’ the foot o’t. This day ne’er a 
coo will gie her maister a drop 0’ milk, though he war 
gawing to starve.” The tailors slunk away abashed, 
and from that day forward the wives of Deloraine have 
fed their tailors on nothing but chappit ’taties and 
kale.! 
Now it is clear from Kelly’s Indo-European Tra- 
ditions (p. 229), that witchcraft has always been potent 
in the dairy, and he accounts for it thus. ‘The Aryan 
idea that the rain-clouds were the cows of heaven has 
been well preserved among the Northern nations. As 
Indra used to milk the cloud cows, and churn the milk 
lakes and fountains with his thunderbolt, so did Thor 
with his axe, Our ancestors’ mythology has passed 
into our own superstitions, and so witches of modern 
days draw milk from the handle of an axe stuck in a 
doorpost. We find a close parallel to the history of 
the wife of Deloraine at Caseburg, in North Germany, 
where a farmer who got no milk from his dairy, put the 
affair in the hands of a wise man, and the wise man 
detected the culprit in the person of a neighbour’s wife. 
This woman had stuck a broom-handle into the wall of 
her own cow-house which was nearest to the farmer's 
dairy. ‘To the handle she had hung a bucket, and was 
milking the broom-stick, which under her hands yielded - 
a plentiful flow of milk.? 
1 In the curious old volume of sermons in German, by Dr. Johann 
Geyler von Keysersperg, entitled ‘DieEmeis, preached in Strasbourg a.p. © 
1508, and published in 1517, is a quaint woodcut of witches smilking 
pump-handles, and a sermon on the iniquity of those old hags who thus 
drain their neighbours’ cows of milk. That portion of the wife of Delo- 
raine’s story, concerning the inability of the apprentice to stop the milk, 
closely resembles the German tale of the magician and his pupil, which 
Giéthe has versified in his ‘ Zauberlehriing. —S. B. G.

The rich dairies of Holland and Belgium are not 
proof against such evil practices, but the means of 
redress are well known. They are as follows: ‘ When 
a sorceress has by her arts milked all the milk from a 
cow, the cow must soon afterwards be milked again. 
Let the milk thus obtained be set on the fire and made 
warm, and then beat with a stick till not a drop 
remains in the vessel. Any milk that flows over on the 
ground may also be beaten, for the more beating there 
is the better, since every stroke given to the milk is 
received by the sorceress on her back from the devil. 
It has often happened here (at Laeken) that sorceresses 
have been confined to their beds, for a week or more, 
from having been thus beaten.” One Dutch farmer, 
however, preferred actually administering the blows 
himself; so, observing one day an old witch go with a 
knife outside his dairy, turn to the moon, and repeat 
these words— 
Here cut I a chip 
In the dairy’s wall, 
And another thereto, 
So take I the milk from this cow, 
he took a thick rope, ran up to the sorceress and beat 
her well, exclaiming : 
Here strike I a stroke, 
And another as I may, 
And a third thereto, 
So keep I the milk with the cow. 
And this, it is quaintly said, was the best method he 
could adopt.! 
In Motherwell’s preface to Henderson’s Proverbs is 
a narration which bears on this part of our subject.

MAY DEW. 163 
The author says, that the ancestor of one of his neigh- 
bours in a Scottish village, going out early with his 
gun one May-day or Beltane morning, found two 
carlines long suspected of witchcraft, but never yet 
caught in the fact, brushing the May dew off the 
pasture-fields with a long hair tether. They fled at 
his approach, leaving behind them the instrument of 
their incantations, which he gathered up, carried home, 
and placed above the cow-house door. The consequence 
was that the next milking-time the dairymaids could 
not find pails to hold the supply of milk which the cows 
yielded, till the old gentleman took down and burnt 
the tether, after which things went on again in the 
usual way. There were a number of knots in the rope, 
every one of which went off like a pistol-shot when it 
was burnt. Mr. Kelly tells of a hair rope too, which 
in the hands of a witch would yield milk, adding that 
it must be made from the hair of different cows with a 
knot for each cow. The following verse was sung by 
way of incantation on such occasions: 
Meare’s milk, and deer’s milk, 
And every beast that bears milk, 
Between St. Johnston and Dundee, 
Come a’ to me, come a’ to me | 
As to May dew, the belief in its virtue extends to 
Germany, or rather seems to have originated there, 
since the Germans have an appellation for a witch 
derived from her connection with it. They call her 
Daustriker (Thaustreicher), dew-striker or scraper. 
When the dew falls on May-morning, they say, it will 
be a good butter year. On such a morning a witch 
went out before sunrise into her neighbour’s fields, took 
up the dew with large linen cloths, then wrung them 
out, and so collected the dew in a vessel. Afterwards, 
M2

every time she wished to make butter, she took a 
spoonful of it and poured it into the churn, saying 
at the same time, ‘From every bouse a spoonful.’ 
” By this process she took on each occasion so much 
butter from every one of the owners of the fields she 
had swept of dew. Once, however, she left her man to 
churn, but not rightly understanding the matter, he 
blundered out, while taking the dew, ‘From every 
‘house a bushelful ;’ so when he churned there came so 
much butter that it spread out over the whole house, 
and people were at a loss what to do with it.’ 
The German witches seem, indeed, to have been unre- 
mitting in their attacks on the dairy. ‘There was a 
time when they were particularly mischievous. It was 
then indispensable for every housewife to have a 
handle made of the wood of the service (quicken) tree 
to her churn, else she could never be sure of getting 
butter. A man one morning early, on. his way from 
Jagerup to Hadersleben, heard, as he passed by Woiens- 
gaard, that they were churning in the yard; but at the 
same time he observed that a woman whom he knew 
was standing by the side of a running brook, and churn- 
ing with a stick in the water. On that same day he 
saw her again selling a large lump of butter in Haders- 
leben. In the evening, as he again passed by Woiens, 
they were still churning; whereupon he went to the 
house, and assured them that their labour was all in 
vain, for the butter was already sold at Hadersleben.’* 
According to Mr. Kelly, the proper antidote for witch- 
craft in the dairy is a twig of rowan-tree, bound with 
scarlet thread, or a stalk of clover with four leaves, 
laid in the byre. To discover the witch, the gudeman’

breeks must be put upon the horns of the cow, one leg 
upon each horn, when she, being let loose, will for 
certain run straight to the door of the guilty person. 
He also mentions a Scottish witch having been seen 
milking the cows in the shape of a hare, a creature 
closely connected with witchcraft since the memorable 
day when the prince of necromancers, Sir Michael 
Scott, was turned into a hare by the witch of Falsehope, 
and hunted by his own hounds, till, jaded and dis- 
comfited, he was fain to take refuge in his own jaw- 
hole (anglic2, common sewer). In fact, the cat and the 
hare are the two creatures into which the witch of modern 
days transforms herself when in extremity. Stories of 
cunning hares, defying all hounds and hunters, are to 
be found in every part of the country. That recorded 
by Mr. Wilkie is as follows :— 
‘The Laird (Harry Gilles) of Littledean was extremely 
fond of hunting. One day, as his dogs were chasing a 
hare, they suddenly stopped, and gave up the pursuit, 
which enraged him so much that he swore the animal 
they had been hunting must be one of the witches of 
Maxton. No sooner had he uttered the word than 
hares appeared all round him, so close that they even 
sprang over the saddle before his eyes, but still none of 
his hounds would give them chase. In a fit of anger, 
he jumped off his horse and killed the dogs on the spot, 
all but one large black hound, who at that moment 
turned to pursue the largést hare. Remounting his 
horse, he followed the chase, and saw the black hound 
turn the hare and drive it directly towards him. The 
hare made a spring as if to clear his horse’s neck, but 
the laird dexterously caught hold of one of her fore- 
paws, drew out his hunting-knife, and cut it off; after 
which the hares, which bad been so numerous, all
-P-A-G-E-194
166 WITCHCRAFT, 
disappeared. Next morning Laird Harry heard that a 
woman of Maxton had lost her arm in some unaccount- 
able manner; so he went straight to her house, pulled 
out the hare’s foot (which had changed in his pocket to 
a woman’s hand and arm), and applied it to the stump. 
It fitted exactly. She confessed her crime, and was 
drowned for witchcraft the same day in the well, by 
the young men of Maxton.’! 
Mrs. Bray, Southey’s correspondent, tells of a similar 
legend in Devonshire. The grandson of a witch at 
Tavistock was accustomed to get sixpences from a neigh- 
bouring huntsman by pointing out where he would find 
a hare, which hare was never caught. At last, measures 
were taken for a very vigorous chase; the hare was hard- 
pressed, and the boy was heard crying out, ‘Run, 
granny—run for your life!’ She did so, and just gained 
her cottage, where her pursuers found her panting and 
bleeding. The culprits were let off for that time with a 
whipping, but the old woman is said to have ended her 
days at the stake, a convicted witch.? 
Through the Dales of Yorkshire we find hares still in 
the same mysterious relationship with witches. The 
Rev. J. C. Atkinson informs me that a new plantation 
having been made near Eskdale, great havoc was com- 
mitted among the freshly-planted trees by hares. Many 
of these depredators were shot, but one hare seemed to 
bid defiance to shot and snare alike, and returned to 
the charge night after night. By the advice of a wise 
+ Nyauld (De la Lycanthropie, Paris, 1615) relates (p. 52), that in a 
village of Switzerland, near Lucerne, a peasant was once attacked by a 
wolf while he was hewing timber. - He defended himself, and smote off 
the foreleg of the beast. The moment that the blood began to flow, the 
creature’s foot changed, and he recognised in his enemy a woman of his 
acquaintance without her arm. She was burnt alive—S. B. G.

ESKDALE WITCHES. 167 
man (I believe of the wise man of Stokesley, of whom 
more will be said by-and-by), recourse was had to 
silver shot, which was obtained by cutting up some 
small silver coin. The hare came again as usual, and 
was shot with the silver charge. At that moment an 
old lady who lived at some distance, but had always 
been considered somewhat uncannie, was busy tamming, 
4, é. roughly carding wool for her spinning. She sud- 
denly flung up both hands, gave a wild shriek, and 
crying out, ‘They have shot my familiar spirit, fell 
down and died, 
In another dale, he adds, higher up the course of the 
Esk, was a hare which baffled all the greyhounds that 
were slipped at her. They seemed to have no more 
chance with her than if they were coursing the wind. 
There was at the time a noted witch residing near, and 
her advice was asked about this wonderful hare. She 
seemed to have little to say about it, however, only she 
thought they had better let it be, and above all they must 
takecare how they slipped a black dog at it. Nevertheless, 
either from recklessness or from distrust of their adviser, 
the party did go out coursing soon after with a black dog. 
The dog was slipped, and they perceived at once that 
the hare was at a disadvantage. She made as soon as 
possible for a stone wall, and attempted to escape- 
through a ‘smout’ or sheephole at the bottom. Just 
as she reached it, the hound threw himself upon her 
and caught her in the haunch, but was unable to hold 
her. She got through, and was seen no more. The 
sportsmen, either in bravado or from terror of the con- 
sequences, went straight to the house of the witch to 
say what had happened. They found her in bed, hurt, 
she said, by a fall; but the wound looked very much as 
if it had been produced by the-teeth of a dog, and: it 
was on a part of the person corresponding to that by
-P-A-G-E-196

which the hare had been seized before their eyes by the 
black hound. Whether this wise woman recovered from 
the effects of the accident, I do not know; but the Guis- 
borough witch, who died within the memory of man, was 
lame for several years, in consequence, it was said, of a 
bite she received from a dog while slipping through the 
keyhole of her own door in the shape of a hare. 
“The witch of Hawkwell, in Northumberland, trans- 
formed herself into a hare, and the trap-hole in a door 
through which she used to bolt in when hard-pressed 
is still pointed out. A whin-stone on the roadside 
is also shown, melted down from her sitting on it. This 
witch used to show her spite by disabling the young 
horses that fed behind her cottage. . In Sir W. Scott's 
«Demonology and Witchcraft’ (Letter [X.)we find the dis- 
enchanting rhyme, by virtue of which disguised witches 
could recover their own shape, if only they gained time 
to repeat it: 
Hare, hare, God send thee care ! 
Tam in a hare’s likeness now, 
But I shall be a woman even now. 
Hare, hare, God send thee care ! 
In fact, the hare is the most common disguise of a 
witch in all the northern countries of Europe. Thorpe’s 
Mythology! contains many instances, and there is one 
in which, by astrange caprice, the sorceress assumed the 
form of a toad. About the end of the sixteenth century, 
in West Flanders, a peasant had a quarrel with the land- 
lady of the alehouse in which he had been drinking, and 
at last she uttered this threat: ‘ For this thou shalt not 
reach home to-night, or I’ll never come back.’ Accord- 
ingly, when he went down to the canal and got into his 
boat, he could not, with all his exertions, move it from the 
shore. In his distress, seeing some soldiers pass by, he 
1 Vol. iii. p. 278.
-P-A-G-E-197
TOADS AND WITCHES. 169 
asked them to come and help him. They did so, but allin 
vain, till one of them proposed to throw out some things 
which were lying at the bottom of the boat; When 
these things were moved the men discovered beneath 
them an enormous toad, with eyes like glowing coals. 
One of the soldiers stabbed the reptile through the 
body and flung it into the water, and the others gave it 
several wounds in the belly as it floated by the boat 
upon its back. They tried again to move the boat, and 
now it glided off without any further trouble, which 
so pleased the peasant that he took the soldiers back to 
the alehouse for some refreshment. Asking for the 
landlady, they were told she was at the point of death, 
from wounds which could not be accounted for, since she 
had not left the house. On enquiry the wounds exactly 
corresponded with those inflicted on the reptile. 
I do not know any other instance in which the witch 
assumes this loathsome shape, but the toad has ever 
figured largely in the records of superstition. It stands 
first in the horrible list of ingredients which the witches

toad, dried, placed in a silk bag, and worn round the 
neck, is in Devonshire the common charm for the king’s- 
evil. White witches and wise men supply these charms 
for a fee of five shillings, Sometimes they eut from the 
living reptile the part analogous to that in which the 
patient is suffering, bury the rest of the creature, wrap 
that part in parchment, and tie it round the patient’s 
neck, A cure for rheumatism in the same county runs 
thus: burn a toad to powder, tie the dust in silk, and 
wear it round the throat. / 
In my next story the cat is the creature simulated by 
the witch. Like the hare, the cat mixes largely in the 
mythology of all the Indo-European nations. If the 
goddess Freya was attended by hares as her train- 
bearers and light-bearers, her chariot was drawn by cats. 
Perhaps these cats were originally tigers; perhaps 
Pussy’s gleaming eyes and weatherwise propensities 
procured her the distinction, by inspiring belief in her 
supernatural powers. In the present instance, an honest 
Yorkshireman, who bred pigs, often lost his young ones. 
He therefore applied to the wise man of Stokesley, who 
told him they were bewitched by an old woman who 
lived near, and to whom my informant had long paid 
parochial relief. The owner of the pigs called to mind 
that he had often seen a cat, a suspicious-looking crea~ 
ture, prowling about his yard, and he jumped to the 
conclusion that this was the old woman in disguise. 
He watched for her, armed with a poker, and when she 
made her appearance flung it at her with all his force.. 
The cat disappeared, and, curiously enough, the poor old 
woman in question, while getting up that same night, 
fell and broke her leg. This of course was conclusive ; 
the man was fully assured that the poker he had hurled 
at the cat had broken the witch’s leg, and that the witch
-P-A-G-E-199
CATS AND WITCHES. 17t 
was no other than the old woman lying lamed in her 
bed.} 
The connection between cats and witches is notorious 
enough, dating at least from the classic story of Galin- 
thea being turned into a cat, and becoming, through the 
compassion of Hecate, her priestess. The picture of a 
witch is incomplete without her cat, by rights a black 
one. It is curious that at Scarborough, a few years 
back, sailors’ wives liked to keep black cats in their 
homes, to ensure the safety of their husbands at sea. 
This gave black cats such a value that no one else could 
keep them; they were always stolen. Mr. Denham 
has recorded some curious old north-country rhymies 
on the subject : : 
‘Whenever the cat 0’ the house is black, 
‘The lasses o’ lovers will have no lack. 
Kiss the black cat, 
An’ ’twill make ye fat; 
Kiss the white ane, 
’T will make ye lean. 
We find witches and cats constantly together in the 
folk-lore of the northern countries of Europe. Thus in 
Eiderstedt, in North Germany, there was a miller who 
1 Spranger relates that 4 labourer was attacked by three young ladies 
in the form of cats, and that they were wounded by him. They were found 
pleeding in their beds next morning. Bodin says that in Vernon, about 
the year 1566, the witches and warlocks gathered in great multitudes 
under the shape of cats, Four or five men were attacked in a lone place 
by a number of these beasts. The men stood their ground with the ut- 
most bravery, succeeded in slaying one puss, and wounded many others, 
Next: day a number of wounded women were found in the town, and 
they gave the judge an accurate account of all the circumstances con- 
nected with their wounding. (The Book of Werewolves, by the Rey. S. 
Baring Gould, pp. 64, 65.) 
Note that in England the extirpation of werewolves, under the Anglo- 
Saxon kings, hag altered the ancient legends of lycanthropy into stories 
of transformation into hares and cate.—S. B. G. 
 
-P-A-G-E-200

was unfortunate enough to have his mill burned down 
every Christmas Eve. At last a courageous servant 
undertook to keep watch in the mill on the fatal night. 
The fellow kindled a fire and made himself a good kettle- 
ful of porridge, which he stirred with a large ladle, while 
an old sabre lay beside him. Erelong a troop of cats 
entered the mill, and he heard one say in a low tone to 
another, ‘ Moasekin ! go and sit by Hanskin !’—on which 
a beautiful milkwhite cat came creeping softly to him, 
and placed herself by his side. In a moment, taking a 
ladleful of the scalding porridge, he dashed it in her 
face, then seizing the sabre cut off one of her paws. On 
this the cats all disappeared, and instead of the paw 
appeared a delicate woman’s hand, with a gold ring’ on 
one of the fingers bearing his master’s cypher. Next 
morning the miller’s wife lay in bed and would not rise. 
‘Give me thy hand, wife,’ quoth the miller. She re- 
fused, but she could not long conceal the mutilated arm, 
and at last was burnt for a witch.! 
There is a Norwegian tradition to the same effect, in 
which a courageous tailor discovers the witchery. Again, 
in the Netherlands, one bold Jan undertakes to lodge for 
a night in the haunted castle of Erendegen, provided only 
he is supplied with everything requisite for frying pan- 
cakes. He makes a fire and begins his work, when a black 
cat walks in, sits down before the fire, and asks Jan what 
he is about. ‘I am making pancakes, my little friend,’ 
answered the hero. Seven more cats entered, put the 
same question, and are answered as before. Then, taking 
each other’s paws, they danced round and round, on 
which Jan flings over them the scalding batter from his 
fryingpan, and they all vanish. The next day it was 
reported in the village that the shoemaker’s wife was

-P-A-G-E-201
DUCKS AND WITCHES. 173 
burnt all over the body. Bold Jan showed no surprise 
at the news ; he simply said that the castle would not be 
haunted any longer, which proved to be the case. 
Cats and witches appear together in the following 
Flemish story, from Thorpe’s Mythology (vol. iii. p. 237): 
An inhabitant of Stockbam, on the birth of a child, goes 
to acquaint his mother, and is astonished to find her al- 
ready informed of the event, though she lived half an 
hour’s walk from the village, and no communication had 
taken place to his knowledge. On his way home the good 
man was molested by a perpetually increasing swarm of 
cats, who crowded about him and obstructed his way. 
He struck at them with his stick, but to no purpose; 
they tore away his silver shoe-buckles, and pushed him 
into the brook which ran by the wayside. On return- 
ing home, wet and tired, the man sent for the priest and 
related his adventure. ‘ Ah,’ said the priest, ‘I see what 
itallis! Now, if youdesire your wife and child todo well, 
take care you give nothing out of your house to anyone 
who may beg at the door.’ The man promised to follow 
the advice, and for three weeks he did so, though the 
door was besieged by beggars of every age and condition. 
At last an old woman came and begged for a crust of 
bread so piteously that the wife, who was sitting up with 
the child in her lap, entreated her husband to give it, 
Against his better judgment, he did so. Instantly the 
infant was torn from its mother’s arms by invisible 
hands and dashed against the ceiling, while the mother 
received a shock which threw her into a corner. The 
priest was summoned, but could do nothing: he pro- 
nounced mother and child past human help, and, in fact, 
both died within a week. 
Danish witches transform themselves also into ducks. 
A buntsman who used to pass the farm of Baller, near
-P-A-G-E-202
174 ‘WITCHCRAFT. 
Ostrel, observed constantly in its neighbourhood a hare 
or a wild duck, neither of which could he ever hit. At 
last he shot at the duck with a silver button from his 
jacket, and wounded it, but it fluttered away into the 
poultry-house, Going into the farm-kitchen to ask for 
the duck, he saw by the chimney an ugly old woman, 
with one shoe off, and blood streaming from her leg. 
She said she had fallen down and hurt herself, but the 
huntsman felt convinced he saw before him the witch 
he had shot, and hurried away with the utmost speed.' 
But to return to our own country. The Rev. J. C. 
Atkinson has communicated to me some particulars re- 
specting a noted, Yorkshire witch, Nan Hardwick by 
name, which were communicated to him by an inhabi- 
tant of Danby. This old woman lived,in one of the two 
lonely old-fashioned huts known as the Spital Houses; 
and her habit was to go every evening, a little before 
dark, and squat among the whins on a bank at Oenthorpe, 
about a mile from her dwelling, for what purpose or 
in what form the narrator sayeth not. This being her 
custom, the young men of the neighbourhood took up 
the practice of collecting the five or six hounds kept in 
that part of the parish, with any other dogs they could 
get hold of, to bunt, as they said, ‘Auld Nan Hardwick.’ 
When they found her, as they usually did, a loud clatter 
was heard along the ‘causey’ or ancient horse-road 
leading to Oenthorpe in the direction of the witch’s resi- 
dence, all the dogs following in full ery.?

AULD NAN HARDWICK. “195 
One evening, a little before the usual hour of the 
hunt, a young man, who was generally foremost in the 
sport, happened to be on the ‘causey’ in question, and 
to see Nan Hardwick on the way to her place of evening 
resort. ‘She wasall black that night,’ said the narrator 
(one William Agur, a parishioner of Danby), ‘ for ye ken 
she wur not alla’s the same to look at;’ and the young 
man (T. P. by name) determined that she should not 
pass him on the ‘causey.’ So he drew himself up, set 
his legs close together, and squared himself so as to en- 
gross the entire width of the narrow gangway. The 
witch neither paused nor turned aside ; she came straight 
on, and in a minute was in the rear of him who would 
have arrested her. How she went by him T. P. could 
never tell; he was still occupying the whole space, his 
legs were still close to each other, but, as far as he could 
pronounce upon any part of the transaction, he felt con- 
vinced she had passed between them. . 
The young man’s father, himself a T. P. too, was 
about this time Overseer of the Poor, and, witch though 
she was, ¢ Au’d Nan Hardwick’ applied for parish relief.

T. P. stoutly refused her, though he knew well that he 
thus exposed himself to her illwill. One day, as he was 
leaving Castleton, he met her coming in the other direc- 
tion. Between them ran the small stream which drains 
Danby Dale, now crossed by a ‘draught bridge,’ then 
merely bya single stone, just wide enough to let one 
person pass at a time, with a ‘hemmel’ or -handrail on 
either side. TT. P. reached the bridge first. No feel- 
ing of courtesy prompted him to stand back till Auld Nan 
had crossed, so he marched sturdily on to the middle of 
the bridge, but no farther. There her power fell upon 
him, and he stood like a statue, unable to move hand or 
foot, till she was pleased to set him free—which was not 
at once. 
This anecdote is curious as an instance of a spell un- 
_ destroyed by the power of running water, and I believe 
a solitary one. The law is all but absolute, that every 
species of magic and witchcraft was annihilated by the 
force of a running stream. The Goblin Page might 
counterfeit the heir of Buccleugh : 
But as a shallow brook they crossed, 
The elf, amid the running stream, 
His figure changed, like form in dream, 
And fled, and shouted, ‘Lost! lost! lost!

Auld Nan Hardwick possessed, it would seem, 
a power beyond that of the mighty masters of the 
Black Art, in old days. By the kindness of the late
-P-A-G-E-205
NANNIE SCOTT. 177 
Dr. Johnson, of Sunderland, we may compare this Cleve- 
Jand witch with her Northumbrian sister, Nannie Scott. 
He wrote thus to me respecting her :-—-* We find in this 
locality many relics of the Scandinavian superstitions, 
varied and mixed up with modern customs and 
phraseology. The old keelmen (once numbering some 
hundreds) on the Wear were brimful of superstitious 
stories and legends, and their nightly rambles on shore 
and river, to seek their vessels and bring them in with 
the tide, are very amusing. I remember, when a boy, 
a witch who resided in a little hovel near us, in Sunder- 
land, and with whom I was on most friendly terms, 
much to the disgust of my nurse. She told fortunes by 
the stars, practised the black art, and sold a compound 
of treacle, &e., called by us “claggum.” Her hatred 
was considered certain death; and children once under 
her protection were sure to be lucky in life. She hada 
black cat and a black dog, both unmitigated savages 
and thieves (the poor animals, being deemed familiars, 
were pelted and persecuted into ferocity), and few 
women were more coaxed and toadied than was Nannie 
Scott. She prayed for fair winds for sailors’ wives ; she 
sold love-charms to bring together sulking sweethearts ; 
and she did all with an air of solemn strong-mindedness 
that bore down any approach to discredit. She lived 
to a very great age, and died about twenty years ago.’ 
Auld Nan Hardwick and Nannie Scott, however, 
sink into insignificance before the wise man of Stokesley, 
jong the oracle of South Durham, as well as of Cleve- 
land. The name of this personage was Wrightson. He 
flourished at Stokesley above fifty years ago; and such 
ascendancy did he obtain in the neighbourhood, that he 
was at once resorted to in cases of sickness, distress, or 
loss of property, and this not by the lower orders alone. 
N
-P-A-G-E-206
    178 WITCHCRAFT. 
His private character appears to have been very bad ; 
still his influence in Stokesley was so great that he was 
constantly in request as godfather to the children of 
the place; and on these occasions he used to attend 
church in a scarlet coat, a long white waistcoat and 
full-starched shirt-frill, crimson knee-breeches, and 
white stockings. . Several stories of his craft have come 
tome from an eyewitness, having been repeated to the 
Rev. J. C. Atkinson by an old man turned eighty-two, 
but in- possession of his faculties, and of entire respecta- 
bility of character. Wrightson used always to say that 
he had no power or knowledge beyond other men except 
when fasting, that he owed his powers to his being the 
seventh son of a seventh daughter, and that he was 
quite unable to transmit them to his own son. The 
following stories, if true, go towards proving him to have 
been a natural clairvoyant :— 
Years ago, when the old man at Danby was young, a 
relation of his had a cow, which fell ill of a disease which 
baffled the skill of every cow-leech in the neighbourhood. 
Our informant was therefore mounted on a horse belong- 
ing to his relative, and despatched to Stokesley to con- 
sult the wiseman. On opening his door—before he had 
time to explain his errand—the wizard said, ‘I know 
what has brought you here; you have come about a 
cow, and if I cannot tell you as much about the creature 
as you can tell me, it is not likely I can help you.’ 
He then proceeded to describe the cow, her colour and 
appearance, her symptoms-—constant restlessness, and 
uneasy movements, and a peculiar sound she uttered ; 
also her position in the cow-house. ‘The door opened,’ 
he said, ‘right upon her ramp.’ The wise man went 
on to specify her disease, and added that nothing could 
save her. . She died accordingly, and a post-mortem
-P-A-G-E-207
THE WISE MAN OF STOKESLEY. 179 
examination verified all that ‘auld Wrightson’ had 
said. But what seems to have struck our informant 
most was the wizard’s remark on the careful way in 
which he had ridden the horse which brought him to 
Stokesley—the sender had no son who would have been 
so careful with the beast. 
Another instance of the wise man’s strange foreknow- 
ledge was as follows, Some pitmen were working to- 
gether at the Try-up-Trough pits, and left their clothes 
above, as usual, on descending to their work. In the 
afternoon, when work was over, one of them missed his 
shirt, and could not find it anywhere. Borrowing one 
from a friend, the man started straight from the pits to 
Stokesley to consult ‘auld Wrightson,’ taking with him 
a comrade whose Christian name was Elijah. . They 
passed a place called West House, and there Elijah 
deposited his overcoat, which was hot and heavy, ob- 
serving to his friend that they should be able to trust 
the wise man in the matter of the shirt by seeing 
whether he knew where the coat was. 
Here, too, the wizard forestalled all enquiries by an- 
nouncing to the men what they had come about; and 
turning to the comrade, addressed him thus by his 
Christian name, ‘What hast’ee deean wi’ thy coat, 
Elijah? I think thee’st left it a? West House, 
Thinkst’ee t? wise man knaws aught about t’ shart ?’ 
As these were the very words the man had used, he was 
struck dumb with astonishment. The wizard then 
described the shirt, saying it had been made by a left- 
handed person (which was true), and finally said its 
owner would find it at home on his return. He added 
a warning on giving salt out of the house, a most dan- 
gerous thing, and one which the pitman’s mother had 
done that day. 
N2
-P-A-G-E-208
  180 WITCHCRAFT. 
Returning home, they found the shirt had been left 
there by a fellow-workman, who had carried it away in 
mistake, and the house-mother had been guilty of the 
«dangerous act’ of giving salt away. This danger is 
thus explained :—If the salt passes into the hands of any 
person who has the power of wishing, 7.¢. of bringing 
down harm on another by uttering an ill wish, the 
possession of the salt places the giver entirely within 
the power of the wish, It is curious that in Spain 
precisely the same belief holds with regard to leaven. 
The next Stokesley story is as follows. A miller, 
named W. , lost a set of new weights very mysteri- 
ously, and all his searchings and enquiries ended in dis- 
appointment ; he could make out nothing about them. 
So he applied to thé wise man. The miller seems to 
have been allowed the unusual privilege of stating his 
case, and the wizard, after consulting his books, an- 
nounced that he knew about the weights; they should be 
restored; at present they were concealed in an ‘ass- 
midden.’ Accordingly, in the course of a night or two, 
the weights appeared as mysteriously as they had 
vanished, being placed at the miller’s door, and ‘all 
clamed wi’ ass,’ which, of course, was satisfactory. 
Again, a young bull belonging to an inhabitant of 
the district was attacked by sickness, and in spite of all 
remedies was soon at what appeared the point of death 
—too weak to stand, and slung up by ropes to keep it 
from falling. The wise man was sent for, and in due 
time arrived at the house, but declined to speak of the 
animal; saying, in his usual way, that unless he could 
tell them all they could tell him, and a little more, it 
was not likely he could be of much use. At last he 
condescended to light his pipe, and stroll out to the 
*beast-house.’ After a little time, curiosity prompted one  
-P-A-G-E-209
WILLIAM DAWSON. 181 
or two men who were standing about to follow him, 
and approaching the byre, they were surprised to see 
the bull apparently as well as ever, standing without 
any aid from slings, and eating his provender with a 
very hearty appetite. The mode of cure remained a 
secret. 
The concluding anecdote respecting ¢ auld Wrightson,’ 
like that of Nan Hardwick fixing the relentless overseer 
on the bridge, suggests a notion that, consciously or 
unconsciously, these worthies practised something like 
electro-biology. Two men, one of them bearing the 
name of Bob Bennison, and brother to a person still 
living at Danby, were on their way to Stokesley Fair, 
when one of them proposed to turn aside in order to 
‘see auld Wrightson, and have a bit o’ sport wi’ him.’ 
On reaching the wise man’s house, he gave them an 
apparently cordial welcome, seated them in front of the 
fire, and proceeded to mend it by heaping on fuel. 
Fiercer and fiercer it blazed up, and Wrightson’s 
guests, feeling somewhat too warm, tried to edge their 
chairs backwards, but their efforts were vain; they 
found themselves immovably fixed in their seats, and 
the seats immovably fixed in front of the fire, which 
all the time was burning hotter and hotter. After 
giving the men such a roasting as he deemed sufficient, 
the wizard at length set them free, scornfully bidding 
them go on to the fair, and there tell their friends ‘the 
sport they had had wi’ auld Wrightson.’ 
Though the wizard doctor of Stokesley professed him- 
self unable to transmit his mysterious powers to his son, 
one William Dawson pretended to have inherited his 
books and some of his gifts, and he too was consulted 
by persons of. a respectable position in life. A sub- 
stantial Yorkshire farmer, having sustained heavy and
-P-A-G-E-210
182 WITCHCRAFT. 
continuous losses among his stock, consulted this William 
Dawson, and was instructed by him how to find out 
whether witchcraft was really the cause of the mischief. 
The farmer was to take six knots of bottree (bore-tree 
or elder) wood, and placing them in orderly arrange~ 
ment beneath a new ashen bow! or platter, was so to 
leave them. If, on looking at them some little time 
afterwards, they were found in confusion, ‘all squandered 
about,’ as he phrased it, there could be no doubt the 
beasts were perishing from the effects of witchcraft. 
This was done, and on inspection the knots were found 
in utter confusion. So the farmer was directed to take 
the heart of one of the dead beasts, and stick in it nine 
new nails, nine new pins, and as many new needles. 
The heart thus prepared was to be burnt on a fire made 
and fed with witchwood (rowan-tree) a little before 
midnight, at which hour a certain verse of the Bible 
was to be read over the flames, and the spell would be 
broken. All was made ready, and the’ doors of the 
farmhouse secured with bolt and bar, to say nothing of 
tables and chairs heaped against them for additional 
security. The heart lay on the mystic fire; as mid- 
night approached, the operator touched it with the 
poker, and it burst asunder into many pieces. Gather- 
ing them together upon the hot embers, that they might 
be thoroughly consumed, he read the appointed verse, 
and at the same moment a rushing and clattering was 
heard down the paved causey which led from the house- 
door to the turnpike (the highroad) in front, as if a 
carriage-and-four were driven down it furiously. Next 
began a terrible knocking and hammering, first at the 
front door, then at the back; but as the embers of the 
heart wasted in the fire, the sounds without grew 
weaker and fainter, till, as the last spark disappeared,
-P-A-G-E-211
THE ELDER-TREE. 183° 
the noise céased; and from that night no’ further harm 
befell the stock. : 
The mention of the six knots of elderwood is curious, - 
for that tree mixes largely in folk lore. Some say the. 
cross was made from its wood; others, that on it Judas 
hanged himself. Mr. Wilkie observes that the tree is 
obnoxious to witches, because their enemies use the 
green juice of its inner bark for anointing the eyes. 
Any baptised person whose eyes are touched with it can 
see what the witches are about in any part of the world. 
Compare with this the Danish belief, that he who stands 
under an elder-bush at twelve o’clock on Midsummer 
Eve, will see Tolv, the king of the elves, go by with all 
his train. A Danish remedy for toothache is to take ap 
elder twig, put it into the mouth, then stick it in the 
wall, saying, ‘Depart, thou evil spirit!’ As appears by 
Hans Andersen’s stories, it is thought in Denmark that 
there dwells in the-elder-tree a being called Hyldemoer, 
or elder-mother, who avenges all injuries done to the 
tree: hence it is not advisable to have moveables of 
elderwood. The elder-mother once pulled a baby by 
the legs, and molested it till it was taken out of an 
elderwood cradle! Danish peasants will not. cut this 
tree without asking permission, thus, —‘ Hyldemoer, 
Hyldemoer, permit me to cut thy branches.’! In Lower 
Saxony, the formula is as follows, to be repeated three 
times, with bended knees and folded hands :— 
Lady Elder, 
Give me some of thy wood, 
Then will I give thee some of mine, 
When it grows in the forest.” 
But to return to Willie Dawson, All his powers, 
such as they were, failed to help him in the battle of

life, for, from being a farmer at Quaker’s Grove, near 
Stokesley, he sank into poverty, and ended his days, in 
very reduced circumstances, in South Durham. I have 
received another account of his magical incantations 
from a correspondent, who himself witnessed them when 
aboy. The object of them was to restore to health a 
young man said to be bewitched. A fire was made by 
midnight, as before, and the doors and windows closed. 
Clippings from every finger and toe-nail of the patient, 
with hair from each temple and the crown of his head, 
were stuffed into the throat of a pigeon which had pre- 
viously been placed between the patient’s feet, and there 
had died at once, thus attesting the witchery from which 
he was suffering. The bird’s bill was riveted with three 
pins, and then the wise man thrust a pin into its breast, 
to reach the heart, everybody else in the room in turn 
following his example. An opening was then made in 
the fire, and the pigeon dropped into it, The wise man 
began to read aloud Psalms from the Prayer Book, and 
a loud scratching and whining began outside. Allin the 
house, save my informant, were satisfied that the young 
man’s enemy had appeared outside, perhaps in the 
form of a dog; he alone attributed the sounds to the 
wizard’s own dog, which had not been allowed to enter 
the house. His scepticism, however, annoyed the wizard 
and his dupes so much that the lad was fain to keep it 
to. himself. . 
A parallel history to William Dawson’s wild incanta- 
tions has been communicated to me by the Rev J. F. 
Bigge. Not many years ago, there lived at Newcastle a 
wizard named Black Jock, who was much consulted by the 
neighbouring people in all cases of doubt and difficulty. 
On one occasion, a farmer named William P. , who   
was tenant of Richmond Hill, lost a valuable horse by 
 
-P-A-G-E-213
BLACK JOCK OF NEWCASTLE. 185 
a sudden attack of disease so peculiar that it suggested 
the idea of unhallowed charm and evil eye, or at least 
of some strange injury inflicted by a spiteful neighbour. 
So to Black Jock went Farmer P. , and told his tale. 
The wizard listened, and then announced that the horse. 
had been killed by poison administered to it in brewers’ 
grains; and on payment of one pound, he gave the 
following directions for discovering the poisoner. ‘The 
farmer and one chosen friend were secretly to cut up 
the horse and take out its heart, which they were to 
stick full of pins and roast before the fire between eleven 
and twelve o’clock at night, having previously closed 
carefully every aperture communicating with the outer 
air, whether door, window, or other opening, and stuffed 
every interstice with tow or some such material. When 
the clock struck the midnight hour, they might open 
the door, and, looking out, they would assuredly see 
passing by the form of him who had done the injury. 
The wizard’s injunctions were obeyed with right good 
will by the farmer and his trusty servant, Forster Charl- 
ton; but when they looked out, they saw with astonish- 
ment no faint and flitting shadow of a suspicious-looking 
form, but, as it chanced, one of the most respectable 
and kindly-disposed among their neighbours, passing 
by in the flesh, on his way to his own home. To accuse 
such a man of being privy to the poor horse’s death was 
plainly impossible, yet what were they to think? So, 
after much consultation, the watchers went to bed in a 
very perturbed state of mind, determined only on one 
point, the calling the wizard into council again. Sum- 
moned, accordingly, to the spot the very next day, Black 
Jock carefully inspected the premises, and having dis- 
covered a certain round hole on the stairs which opened 
into the outer air, and which they had overlooked and  
-P-A-G-E-214
186 WITCHCRAFT. 
omitted to stuff up, he proclaimed with an oracular and 
impressive demeanour, from which there was no appeal, 
that such carelessness and disregard of his injunctions 
could have ended in no other way; that of course the 
person who had passed by was not the delinquent, but 
that it was owing to the nonfulfilment of the conditions 
imposed that they had not seen him; and, what was 
more, see him now they never would. 
These grisly incantations appear to have taken deep 
root in our ‘north countrie.’? A farmer near Durham, 
on the death of a horse, has lately pursued exactly the 
same plan prescribed by Black Jock, but with better 
snecess than attended the Northumbrian farmer; for 
after the poor steed’s heart had been -pierced and 
roasted, the watchers distinctly heard the howling of 
spirits round the house, and thus satisfied themselves 
that evil spirits had done the horse to death! The 
owner of the animal narrated this himself to my in- 
formant, who exclaimed, in astonishment, ‘ Why, surely 
you don’t believe that?’ ‘But I do,’ rejoined the 
farmer stoutly, ‘for I heard them myself,’ 
A somewhat similar instance transpired at Durham 
about four years ago. A poor woman, the wife of a 
pitman, was brought before the bench of magistrates on 
the charge of stealing a fowl. She made no attempt to 
deny the fact; indeed, she had previously admitted it to 
the policeman who apprehended her, saying that she 
had committed the theft for the purpose of working out 
a charm which was to restore her sick child to health. 
The child, it appeared, had long been ailing, and was 
now fast pining away, when its mother, full of uneasi- 
ness about it, consulted a witch who lived near. The 
witch solemnly charged her to steal a hen, take out the 
heart, stick it full of pins, and roast it at midnight over 
 
-P-A-G-E-215
BLACK WILLIE OF HARTLEPOOL. 187 
a slow fire, first closing up every communication with 
the outer air. If this were duly done, the hag promised 
that, as the heart was gradually consumed, health would 
return to the suffering child. The magistrates, consi- 
dering the delusion under which the woman had acted, 
dismissed the case. 
The Rev. H. B. Tristram has communicated to me 
another case from the south of the county of Durham: 
«In November of this year (1861) I was sent for by a 
parishioner, the wife of a small farmer, who complained 
that: she had been scandalised by her neighbours op- 
posite, who accused her of witchcraft. These neigh- 
hours had lost two horses during the last year, and 
therefore consulted “ Black Willie ” at Hartlepool, who 
assured them that they had been bewitched. Acting on 
his advice, they adopted the following means for dis- 
covering the witch. Having procured a pigeon, and tied 
its wings, every aperture to the house, even to the key- 
holes, was carefully stopped, and pins were run into the 
pigeon whilst alive by each member of the family, so as 
to pierce the poor bird’s heart. The pigeon was then 
roasted, and a watch kept at the window during the 
operation, for the first person who passed the door 
would, of course, be the guilty party. The good woman 
who appealed to me had the misfortune to be the first 
passer-by, and the family were firmly convinced she had 
exercised the “evil eye” upon the dead horses, though 
she was a comely matron, not yet fifty years of age. 
This happened in a village close to the River Tees.’ 
The last instance I shall record took place at Whitby 
in the year 1827. A woman residing in that town was 
suffering from fever, attended with soreness and swelling 
of the throat. Among other remedies, camphorated 
spirits of wine were applied externally to the part 
 
-P-A-G-E-216
188 WITCHCRAFT. 
affected ; but the patient growing worse, her mother took 
_ up a notion that she was bewitched, and that the spell 
had been fixed by the spirits of wine. The old woman 
therefore determined to resort to what she called the 
ancient ordeal. She procured a sheep’s heart, stuck it 
full of new pins, and placed it on the fire to be burnt, 
watching anxiously all the time for the appearance of 
the witch who had troubled her daughter. She looked 
in vain, however, for no one appeared. 
There are two or three points worth notice in these 
grisly rites for the discovery and baffling of witchcraft. 
First, the employment of mountain-ashwood for the 
roasting of the heart. Now the rowan, or mountain- 
ash, is ever the dread of witches, as we see by the old 
rhyme— - 
Black luggie, lammer bead, 
Rowan-tree and red thread, 
Put the witches to their speed. 
Mr. Wilkie alleges the following very good reason for 
their apprehensions. The witch who is touched with a 
branch of this tree by a christened man will be the 
victim carried off by the devil when he comes next to 
claim his tribute. This tribute is alluded to in the 
ballad of young Tamlane— 
O pleasant is the fairyland, 
And happy there to dwell, 
But aye, at every seven years’ end, 
We pay a teind to hell. 
Mr. Kelly considers the mountain-ash to be the 
European representative of the Indian palasa, which it 
resembles in its light luxuriant foliage and red berries, 
or of the mimosa, a tree of the very same genus as well 
as general character. These Indian trees are in as high 
repute in Hindostan as preservatives against magic as 
is the rowan in Scotland, in Cornwall, or in Yorkshire. 
In Cornwall it is called ‘ care,’ and if there is a suspicion

THE ROWAN-TREEF. 189 
of a cow being ‘ overlooked, the herdsman will suspend 
it over her stall, or wreath it round her horns. That it 
is still in repute in Yorkshire let this little anecdote 
witness. I give it in the words of the narrator, as he 
told it to the Rev. J. C. Atkinson :— 
«A woman was lately in my shop, and in pulling out 
her purse brought out also a piece of stick a few inches 
long, I asked her why she carried that in her pocket. 
« Oh,” she replied, “I must not lose that, or I shall be 
done for.” “Why so?” I enquired. ‘ Well,” she an- 
swered, “I carry that to keep off the witches; while I 
have that about me, they cannot hurt me.” On my 
observing that Tthought there were no witches nowa- 
days, she observed quickly, “Oh yes; there are thirteen 
at this very time in the town, but so long as I have my 
rowan-tree safe in my pocket, they cannot hurt me.”” 
This good dame evidently agreed with the old 
rhymer, who said— 
If your whipstick ’s made of row’n, 
‘You may ride your nag through any town; 
but, on the contrary— 
Woe to the lad. 
Without a rowan-tree gad! 
A bunch of ash-keys is thought as efficacious as the 
rowan-stick. An incident mentioned to me by the Rev. 
George Ornsby may be introduced here: ‘The other 
day I cut down a mountain-ash (or wiggan-tree, as it is 
called here) in my carriage-road. The old man who gar- 
dens for me came a day or two after, and was strangely 
disconcerted on seeing what -“ master” had done in his 
absence ; “ for,” said he, “ wherever a wiggan-tree grows 
near a house, t’witches canna come.” He was comforted, 
however, by finding, on closer investigation, that a sucker 
from the tree had escaped destruction.’ 
Mr. Wilkie assures us that, like the mountain-ash, the
-P-A-G-E-218
190 WITCHCRAFT. 
yew is a very upas-tree to the witches, possibly because 
of this constant proximity to churches. They hate the 
holly too, and with good reason: its name is but 
another form of the word holy, and its thorny foliage 
and blood-red berries are suggestive of the most sacred 
Christian associations. The bracken also they detest, 
because it bears on its root the letter C, the ‘initial of 
the holy name Christ, which (says Mr. Wilkie) may 
plainly be seen on cutting the root horizontally. A 
friend suggests, however, that the letter intended is not 
the English C, but the Greek -y, the initial letter of the 
word yptoros, which really resembles very closely the 
marks in the root of the bracken, or Pteris aquilina. 
These marks have, however, been interpreted in many 
ways. Some say they resemble the Austrian double- 
headed eagle, and derive from hence the Latin name 
forthe plant; others see in them Adam and Eve stand- 
ing on either side ef the tree of knowledge, or King 
Charles in the oak; or, again, they try to discover the 
initials of their future husband or wife. 
But witches have their favourite plants as well. They 
love the breom and the thorn, as well as the ragwort, 
which is called in Ireland the fairies’ horse, and use them 
all as means for riding about at midnight. They are 
also fond of hemlock, nightshade, St. John’s-wort, and 
vervain, and infuse their juices into the baleful draughts 
prepared for their enemies. This statement, however, 
contradicts that in St. Colne’s charm, as sung by Meg 
Merrilies at the birth of Harry Bertram— + 
Trefoil, vervain, John’s-wort, dill, 
Hinder witches of their will. 
It contradicts, also, the old rhyme given in the notes to 
the Demon Lover, in the ‘ Minstrelsy of the Scottish 
Border’ + —

ST. JOHN’S-WORT. 191 
Gin ye wud be leman mine, 
_ Lay aside the St. John’s-wort and the verveine, 
For here these platits appear as countercharms, pro- 
tecting a maiden from the approach of a very uncannie 
sprite in the form of a lover. 
Of the St. John’s-wort the following little notice has 
reached me from the Isle of Wight. Peasants there 
say (or did say, before the incursion of visitors drove 
away all the individuality of the place) that, if you tread 
on the St. John’s-wort after sunset, a fairy horse will 
rise from the earth and carry you about all night, 
leaving you in the morning wherever you may chance 
to be at sunrise. 
Mr. Wilkie maintains that the Digitalis purpurea 
was in high favour with the witches, who used to 
decorate their fingers with its largest bells, thence called 
‘witches’ thimbles.’ Hartley Coleridge has more pleasing 
associations with this gay wild flower. He writes of 
‘the fays,-— 
That sweetly nestle in the foxglove bells,’ 
and adds in a note: ‘Popular fancy has generally con- 
ceived a connection between the foxglove and the good 
people. In Ireland, where it is called lusmore, or the 
great herb, and also fairy-cap, the bending of its tall 
stalks is believed to denote the unseen presence of 
- supernatural beings. The Shefro, or ‘gregarious fairy, is 
represented as wearing the corolla of the foxglove on 
his head, and no unbecoming headdress either. Is not the 
proper etymology “ folks’ (7.¢. fairies’) glove?” Surely 
Reynard does not wear gloves in popular tradition ?” 
But to return to the incantations of Black Jock and his 
brotherhood. The horse’s heart, pigeon, fowl, or whatever 
else was consumed upon the rowan-tree fire, was pierced 
through with pins. Now, it is remarkable how often we
-P-A-G-E-220
192 WITCHCRAFT. 
come across pins in the records of superstition. Mary 
de Medicis and her favourite, Leonora Concini, were sus- 
pected of practising against the life of Louis XIII. of 
France, by making a waxen image of him, and impal- 
ing it with pins; and the Duchess of Gloucester, in the 
reign of our Henry VI., was imprisoned on the charge. 
of similar practices. Such sorceries appear to have pre- 
vailed extensively in the northern countries of Europe. 
Thus at Amreem, in North Germany, a man lay for a 
long time sick in bed, and nothing afforded him relief. 
Meanwhile a miller observed from his mill that a 
woman was in the daily habit of going to the Donk- 
k4m. One day he followed her footsteps, and on dig- 
ging in the sand found a little waxen image of a man, 
with a pin stuck through the heart. He drew the pin 
out, took the image home, and burned it; from that 
hour the patient recovered.! 
Again, if a person is robbed, he goes to a so-called 
‘cunning man,’ who engages to.strike out the eye of the 
thief. The following is the process:—The troll-man 
1 Thorpe’s Mythology, vol. iii, page 24, In Devonshire, witches 
and malevolent people still make clay images of those whom they 
jntend to hurt, baptise the image with the name of the person 
whom it is meant to represent, and then stick it full of pins or 
‘burn it, In the former case that person is racked with rheumatism 
in all his limbs; in the second he is smitten with raging fever.. Nider, 
in his ‘Hierarchy of Blessed Angels,’ speaks of a witch named AEni- 
ponte, who, by making an effigy of wax, pricking it with needles in 
divers parts, and then burying it under the threshold of a neighbour's 
house whom she much hated, brought upon that neighbour insufferable 
torments and prickings in the flesh, till the image was found and de- 
stroyed, upon which those evils passed away. King James I. in his 
‘Demonology,’ speaks of the practice as very common, and attributes its 
efficacy to the devil. In Adam Davies’ ‘Gest, or Romance of Aloxander,’ 
Nectabanus, a magician, discovers the machinations of his enemies by 
embattling them in wax figures. So, too, he bewitches a queen by making 
a wax puppet of her, and spreading over it herbs of power.—S. B. G.
-P-A-G-E-221
PINS. 193. 
puts a human figure on a young tree, mutters certain dire 
spells by the devil’s aid, and then drives a sharp instru~ 
ment into the eye of the figure, thus blinding its repre- 
sentative. Or he will shoot with an arrow or bullet at one 
of the members of the figure, thus entailing wounds and 
sores on the corresponding limbs of the living person.’ 
The Flemish countercharm is as follows: Let a sorceress 
melt lead and pour it into water, where it will assume 
a human form, She must then ask the person bewitched 
whereabouts in the body of him who caused the evil it 
shall be sent. The part is named ; the sorceress makes 
a cut or prick in the corresponding limb of the leaden 
image, saying where the person is who inflicted the evil, 
but not naming any name. The evil will leave the - 
victim, and alight upon the perpetrator.? 
It is strange to meet with the same kind of supersti- 
tion in India also, yet such is the case; witness the follow- 
ing extract from a paper by the Rev. George Pettit, of the 
Tinnevelly Mission of the Church Missionary Soeiety: ‘A 
man recently under instruction at Pakunari, now a cate~ 
chist, brought me an ugly wooden image, about six inches 
Jong, with nails driven into it in several places, indicat- 
ing the parts of his body to be attacked with disease. 
He had found it buried near his door, and brought it 
thirty miles to show me, trembling through every 
limb.’ 
Again, witch-finders used to torment their victims by 
thrusting pins into them, with the view of discovering 
upon them the devil’s stigma, or mark, a spot which 
was supposed insensible to pain; and bewitched persons 
were said to vomit pins in large quantities. Throughout 
the North of England we have wishing-wells, where the

passer-by may breathe his wish, and may rest assured of 
its fulfilment, if only he drop a crooked pin into the 
water. The Worm Well at Lambton is one of these; 
there is another in Westmoreland, and another at 
Wooller, in Northumberland. Certainly at St. Helen’s 
Well, near Thorp Arch, in Yorkshire, the offering was a 
scrap of cloth fastened to an adjoining thorn, which 
presented a strange appearance under its burden of 
rags; and at the Cheese Well, on Minchmuir, in Peebles- 
shire, it was a piece of cheese flung into the well, but 
the pin is used as a rule. The country-girls imagine 
that the well is in charge of a fairy or spirit, who must 
be propitiated by some offering; the pin presents itself 
as the most ready and convenient, besides having a 
special suitableness as being made of metal. 
Metallic substances are held throughout the North to 
counteract the influence of witchcraft and every kind of 
evil spirit. Thus, a knife or other utensil of steel is placed 
in the cradle of an unbaptised child in Sweden, to protect 
it from all such dangers; and, again, bathers there will 
throw a bit of steel into the water before they plunge 
into it, saying to the spirit of the stream, ‘ Neck, neck, 
steel in strand; thy father was a steel thief, thy mother 
was a needle thief; so far shalt thou be hence as this cry 
is heard—Ho, hagler!’ Those, too, who visit the holy 
wells of that country cast into them a piece of money, or 
a bit of iron or some other metal.! 
As to the crookedness of the pins dropped into our 
north-country wells, it would seem that, in folk lore, 
crooked things are lucky things; witness the high 
repute of crooked sixpences. Wells reputed sacred, 
under the tutelage, sometimes of saint, sometimes of 
fairy, still exist in many parts of our island and in the

Hebrides. As late as the year 1740, sickly children 
were dipped in St. Bede’s Well, near Jarrow, and a 
crooked pin dropped into it; and the same was done 
when weak eyes were bathed in the well at Whitford, in 
Flintshire, and when water was drawn from Locksaint 
Well, in Skye, and drank as a specific for certain com- 
plaints, 
We pass now to some Tweedside stories of recovery of 
property by the aid of local superstition. The follow- 
ing anecdote is recorded by the Rev. R. O. Bromfield, of 
Sprouston, and I am glad to give it in his own words :— 
‘Some time since, when calling at the house of 
one of my oldest parishioners, who had been a hand- 
loom weaver, he fell to speak of other days; and, 
amongst other things, he told me of the disappearance, , 
some years back, on a fine summer’s evening, of a web, 
of linen which had been laid to bleach by the riverside 
at the foot of the glebe. The fishermen, it seems, were 
burning the water in the Skerry, and the man who had 
charge of the web went off to see the salmon “ leistered,” 
and on his return the web was gone. Of course there 
was a sensation. The story was soon in everybody’s 
mouth, with abundant suspicions of as many persons as 
there were yards in the web of linen. 
‘The web belonged to a very important personage, no 
less than the howdie, or old village midwife, who was 
not disposed to sit down quietly under her loss. So she 
called in the aid of a wise man from Leetholm, and 
next day told her friend the weaver, my informant, 
that she bad found the thief, for the wise man had 
turned the key. The weaver being anxious to’ seé 
something of diablerie, the howdie brought the wise 
man to his house; and the door being locked on all 
within (four in number), the magician proceeded as 
“o2

follows. He took a small key, and attached it to a 
string, which he tied into the family Bible at'a par- 
ticular place, leaving the key hanging out. Next he 
read two chapters from the Bible, one of which’ was the 
history of Saul and the witch of Endor; he then 
directed the howdie and another person to support the 
key between them, on the tips of their forefingers, and 
in that attitude the former was told to repeat'the names 
of all the suspected parties. 
‘Many persons were named, but the key still hung 
between the fingers, when the wise man cried out, “Why 
don’t you say Jock Wilson?” ‘This was accordingly 
done, and immediately the key dropped, i.e. turned off 
the finger-ends. So the news spread far and wide that the 
thief was discovered, for the key had been turned, and 
Jock Wilson was the man! He proved, however, not to 
be the man to stand such imputations, and being with- 
out doubt an honest fellow, he declared “he wud’na be 
made a-thief by the deevil.” So he went to consult a 
lawyer, but after many long discussions the matter died 
away; and my authority, the weaver, says it was believed 
that the lawyer was bribed ; “for he aye likit a dram.”’ 
Now here we have something very like an old super- 
stition, which dates at least from the time of Theocritus 
(3.c. 282). Potter, in his ‘Grecian Antiquities’! says 
that the Greeks called it coskiomancy, and ‘prac- 
tised it for the discovery of thieves and other sus- 
pected persons. They tied a thread to the sieve, by 
which it was upheld, or else placed under it a pair of 
shears, which they held. up by two fingers; then they 
prayed to the gods for assistance, after which they 
repeated the names of the persons under suspicion; and 
he or she at whose name the sieve moved, was thought to

THE SIEVE: AND SHEARS. 197 
have committed the offence. Such was the rite resorted. 
to in pagan Greece. Mr. Kelly finds the key to it in 
the marvellous powers with which the sieve was invested 
in days of yore through its connection with rainclouds. 
Throughout the Greek and Teutonic mythology the 
sieve may be seen in the hand of cloud-gods and cloud- 
goddesses, who employed it in watering the earth. 
Hence it became a sacred implement, and the Greeks, 
Romans, Germans, and Slaves used it alike in divinations 
and solemn ordeals. Cornelius Agrippa speaks of it-as 
thus employed, and in ‘ Hudibras’ we find mention of— 
The oracle of sieve and shears, 
That turns as certain as the spheres. 
The practice has descended in Germany almost to our 
own day. It is thus carried on in Mecklenburg. ‘They 
take a sieve that has been inherited from relations, 
lay it on the rim, open a pair of inherited scissors, and 
stick the points so deep into the rim of the sieve, that 
it may be supported by them. Two persons then, of 
opposite sexes, go with the sieve into a perfectly dark 
place, hold the middle finger of the right hand under 
the ring of the scissors, and so raise up the sieve. One 
then enquires, ‘In the name, &c., I ask of thee; tell me 
truly, has Hans, Fritz, Peter, done it:?? On naming the 
guilty one, the ririg slides off, the sieve falls to the 
ground, and the thief is detected.! 
In the passage above cited, from Potter's ‘ Grecian 
Antiquities,” he says that the vulgar, in many parts of 
England, have an abominable practice of using a riddle 
and a pair of shears in divination. A book, however, 
appears commonly to have superseded the key in this 
country. When Reginald Scott speaks of this species of

divination, (in his ‘Discovery of Witchcraft,’ a.p. 1599), 
itis with a Psalter and key; and in a case brought 
before the Thames Police, in 1832, the Bible was used. 
One Mr. White, it seems, had lost some property, and 
agreed with the neighbours to resort to the Bible and 
key in discovery of the thief. They placed the street- 
door key on the Fiftieth Psalm, closed the volume, and 
fastened it tightly with a string. The Bible and key 
were then suspended to a nail, and the name of Mrs. 
Blucher (the person on whom suspicion had fallen) 
was repeated three times by one of the women, while 
another recited these lines :— 
If it turn to thee, 
Thou art the thief, and we all are free. 
The key then turned, or was thought to do so, and 
Mrs. Blucher was proclaimed to be the thief; on which 
she went into Mrs. White’s house and beat her, and was 
finally brought before the police-court on a charge of 
assault. 
A book and key are used, I believe, in a somewhat 
similar way, by modern mesmerisers, to test the strength 
of will. If two persons thus hold them on a string, the 
key will turn, they say, to the one who possesses the 
strongest will. 
But to return to the Tweedside. .I am indebted to 
the Rev. R. O. Bromfield for the history of another 
web of linen stolen a few years back from the banks of 
the same river. In this instance the owner was one 
Tam Aldren, an elder in the Kirk, and he resorted to 
a wise woman at Berwick-upon-Tweed. She told him at 
once that the cloth was then hidden under a certain 
tree, which she described, and offered to evoke the forms 
of the thieves, and make them pass before him at that
-P-A-G-E-227
RECOVERY OF STOLEN PROPERTY. 199 
very moment. But honest Tam‘ demurred: he said, 
he didna want to ken wha had stolen the claith, but 
where the claith was put, that he might get it back; 
and no doubt he entertained, too, a lurking fear of being 
brought too near the de’il. So away he went in all haste 
to the tree indicated, to search for his cloth below it, but, 
alas! he found it not. Seeing however, or fancying he 
saw, some traces there of the bleaching composition, 
he maintained ever after that, without any doubt, the 
cloth had once been on that spot.! 
In cases like these, it may be remarked that Devon- 
shire superstition points more to the punishment of the 
thief, than to the recovery of the stolen property. Ifa 
robbery has been committed, it enjoins you to pluck six 
blades of grass from the spot, and take them to a white 
witch ; as many scratches as she makes with a pin in the 
1 It is curious to remark the different forms which superstition as- 
swmes in different grades of society.. While our peasants resort to the 
wizard or wise woman, our gentlemen, it seems, actually have recourse 
to the spirit-rapper. Witness the following anecdote :— 
In the early part of the year 1861, a robbery took place near S—, 
in the county of Durham ; the sum taken was large, and the attendant 
circumstances mysterious. Great efforts were made by the polico to 
discover the thieves, but to no purpose; so the gentleman whose pro-

rapper to aid in the search. The spirit having been evoked, it was an- 
nounced that the lost treasuro was deposited in a certain garden; and 
there, at midnight, the party set to work to recover it, While thus em- 
ployed, they perceived that they were watched, and, secrecy being re- 
quisite for such investigations, they hastily decamped. But what was 
the horror-of the gentleman and his friends when a policeman calied the 
next morning, and announced that he had got on the scent; for he had 
seen the thieves digging in a garden at midnight, and had heard them 
speak of the money they expected to find thore! Little were they pre- 
pared for such a way of ‘turning the tables.’ What makes this incident 
the more singular is, that the gentleman who thus sought for the aid of 
spiritual agency was in the prime of life, and was a person of wealth and 
good position in the county.

Wild and varied as I know the superstitions of my 
native county to be, I must plead guilty to some aston- 
ishment at discovering among them what Brand’ calls 
‘the foreign superstition of the Hand of Glory, once 
firmly believed in many parts of France, Germany, and 
Spain.’ Sir Walter Scott brings it forward as a foreign 
charm. It is the German adventurer, Dousterswivel, 
who is conversant with it, and who (in the ‘ Antiquary’) 
describes it thus racily to the assembled party among 
the ruins at St. Ruth’s :—* Why, my goot master Olden- 
buck, you will only laugh at me. But de Hand of Glory 
is very well known in de countries where your worthy. 
progenitors did live; and it is a hand cut off from a 
dead man as has been hanged for murder, and dried 
very nice in de shmoke of juniper-wood; andif you put 
a little of what you call yew wid your juniper, it will not 
be any better—that is, it will not be no worse; then 
you do take something of de fatsh of de bear, and of de 
badger, and of de great eber (as you do call de grand 
boar), and of de little sucking child as has not been 
christened (for dat is very essentials); and you do make 
a candle, and put into de Hand of Glory at de proper 
hour and minute, with de proper ceremonish; and he 
who seeksh for treasuresh shall never find none at all.’! 
1 The Hand of Glory is the hand of a man who has-been hung, and is 
prepared in the following manner. Wrap the hand in a piece of winding- 
sheet, drawing it tight so as to squeeze out the little blood which may 
remain ; then placo it in an edrthenware vessel with saltpetre, salt, and 
long pepper, all carefully and thoroughly powdered. Let it remain a 
fortnight in this pickle till it is well dried, then expose it to the sun in 
the dog-days till it is completely parched, or, if the sun be not powerful 
enough, dry it in an oven heated with vervain and fern. Next make a 
candle with the fat of a hung man, virgin wax, and Lapland sesame. The

Dousterswivel asserts that the monks used thé Hand 
of Glory as a spell to conceal treasures. Southey places 
_ it in the hands of the enchapter-king Mohareb, when 
he would lull to sleep Yohak, the giant keeper of the 
caves of Babylon— 
Thus he said, 
And from his wallet drew a human hand, 
Shrivelled, and dry, and black. 
And fitting, as he spake 
A taper in his hold, 
Pursued: ‘A murderer on the stake had died ; 
I drove the vulture from his limbs, and lopt 
The hand that did the murder, and drew up 
The tendon-strings to close its grasp. 
And in the sun and wind 
Parched it, nine weeks exposed. 
The taper . . . . but not here the place to impart 
Nor hast thou undergone the rites, 
That fit thee to partake the mystery. 
Look! it burns clear, but with the air around, 
Its dead ingredients mingle deathiness. 
This when the keeper of the cave shall feel, 
Maugre the doom of heaven, 
The salutary spell 
Shall lull his penal agony to sleep, 
And leave the passage free.’ ! 
While Grose gives a full account of it, as used by French 
housebreakers, in a translation from the French of ‘ Les 
Secrets du Petit Albert’ (a.p. 1750), alleging that its use 
was to stupefy those to whom it was presented, and to 
render them motionless, so that they could not stir any 
more than if they were dead. There is one instance on 
record of its use in Ireland: ‘On the night of the 3rd 
Hand of Glory is used to hold this candle when it is lighted, Wherever 
one goes with this contrivance, those it approaches are rendered inca- 
pable of motion as though they were dead. (Colin de Planey, Diction- 
naire Infernal, 1818).—S, B. G.

202 WITCHCRAFT. 
instant (January 1831), some Irish thieves attempted 
to commit a robbery on the estate of Mr. Naper, of 
Loughcrew, county Meath. They entered the house, 
armed with a dead man’s hand with a lighted candle in 
it, believing in the superstitious notion that a candle 
placed in a dead man’s hand will not be seen by any but, 
those by whom it is used; and also that if a candle in a 
dead hand be introduced into a house it will prevent 
those who may be asleep from awaking. The inmates, 
however, were alarmed, and the robbers fled, leaving 
the hand behind them.’ 
The Stainmore story, however, which has with diffi- 
culty been rescued from oblivion by the persevering 
kindness of friends, is much richer in detail. It is as 
follows:—One evening, between the years 1790 and 
1800, a traveller, dressed in woman’s clothes, arrived at 
the Old Spital Inn, the place where the mailcoach 
changed horses, in High Spital, on Bowes Moor. The 
traveller begged to stay all night, but had to go away 
so early in the morning, that if a mouthful of food were 
set ready for breakfast, there was no need the family 
should be disturbed by her departure. The people of 
the house, however, arranged that a servant-maid should 
sit up till the stranger was out of the premises, and 
then went to bed themselves. The girl lay down for a 
nap on the long settle by the fire, but before she shut 
her eyes she took a good look at the traveller, who was 
sitting on the opposite side of the hearth, and espied a 
pair of man’s trousers peeping out from under the gown. 
All inclination for sleep was now gone; however, with 
great self-command, she feigned it, closed her eyes, and 
even began to snore. On this the traveller got up, 
pulled out of his pocket a dead man’s hand, fitted a 
candle to it, lighted the candle, and passed hand and

" THE STAINMORE STORY. 203 
candle several times before the servant-girl’s face, say- 
ing as he did so, ‘Let those who are asleep be asleep, 
and let those who are awake be awake.’ This done, he 
placed the light on the table, opened the outer door, 
went down two or three of the steps which led from the 
house to the road, and began to whistle for his com- 
panions. The girl (who had hitherto had presence of 
mind enough to remain perfectly quiet) now jumped 
up, rushed behind the ruffian, and pushed him down 
the steps. She then shut the door, locked it, and ran 
upstairs to try and wake the family, but without success: 
calling, shouting, and shaking were alike in vain, 
The poor girl was in despair, for she heard the traveller 
and his comrades outside the house. So she ran down 
again, seized a bowl of blue (4.e. skimmed milk), 
and threw it over the hand and candle; after which she 
went upstairs again, and awoke the sleepers without any 
difficulty. The landlord’s son went to the window, and 
asked the men outside what they wanted. They 
answered that if the dead man’s hand were but given 
them, they would go away quietly, and do no harm to 
anyone. This he refused, and fired among them, and 
the shot must have taken effect, for in the morning 
stains of blood were traced to a considerable distance. 
These circumstances were related to my informant, 
Mr. Charles Wastell, in the spring of 1861, by an old 
woman named Bella Parkin, who resided close to High 
Spital, and was actually the daughter of the courageous 
servant-girl. 
It is interesting to compare them with the following 
narrations, communicated to me by the Rev. 8. Baring 
Gould :—‘ Two magicians having come to lodge in a 
publichouse with aview to robbing it, asked permission 
to pass the night by the fire, and obtained it.. When
-P-A-G-E-232
204 WITCHCRAFT. 
the house was.quiet, the servant-girl, ‘suspecting mis- 
chief, crept downstairs and looked through the keyhole. 
She saw the men open a sack, and take out a dry 
withered hand. They anointed the fingers with some 
unguent, and lighted them. Each finger flamed, but the 
thumb they could not light; that was because one of 
the household was not asleep. The girl hastened to her 
master, but, found it.impossible to arouse him. She tried. 
every other sleeper, but could not break the charmed 
sleep. At last, stealing down into the kitchen, while 
the thieves were busy over her master’s strongbox, she 
secured the hand, blew out the flames, and at. once the 
whole household was aroused.”! 
But the next story bears a closer resemblance to the 
Stainmore narrative. One dark night, when all was shut 
up, there came a tap at the door of a lone inn-in the 
middle of. a barren moor. The door was opened, and 
there stood without, shivering and shaking, a poor beggar, 
his rags soaked with rain, and his hands white with cold. 
He asked piteously for a lodging, and it was cheerfully 
granted him ; there was not a spare bed in the house, 
but he could lie on the mat before the kitchen-fire, and 
welcome. 
So this was settled, and everyone in the house went 
to bed except ‘the cook, who from the back kitchen 
could see into the large room through a. pane of glass 
let into the door. She watched the beggar, and saw 
him, as soon as he was left alone, draw himself up from 
the floor, seat himself at the table, extract from his 
pocket a brown withered human hand, and set it upright 
in the candlestick. He then anointed the fingers, and 
applying a match to them, they began to flame. Filled 
with horror, the cook rushed up the backstairs, and

THE THIEF'’S ‘FINGER. / 205 
endeavoured to arouse her master and the men of the 
house. But all was in vain—they slept a charmed sleep ; 
so in despair she hastened down again, and placed her- 
self at her post of observation. 
She saw the fingers of the hand flaming, but the 
thumb remained unlighted, because one inmate of the 
house was awake. The beggar was busy collecting the 
valuables around him into a large sack, and having 
taken all he cared for in the large room, he entered 
another. On this the woman ran in, and, seizing the 
light, tried to extinguish the flames. But this was not 
so easy. She blew at them, but they burnt on as 
before. She poured the dregs of a beer-jug over them, 
but they blazed up the brighter. As a last resource, she 
caught up ajug of milk, and dashed it over the four lam- 
bent flames, and they died out at once. Uttering a loud 
ery, she rushed to the door of the apartment the beggar 
had entered, and locked it. The whole family was 
roused, and the thief easily secured and hanged. This 
tale is told in Northumberland. 
A variation of the same belief prevailed in Belgium. 
Not far from Bailleul, in West Flanders, a thief was 
taken, on whom was found the foot of a man who had 
been hanged, which he used for the purpose of putting 
people to sleep. Again, in the village of Alveringen, 
there formerly lived a sorceress who had a thief’s finger 
over which nine masses had been said; for, being 
acquainted with the sacristan, she had wrapped it in a 
cloth and laid it on the altar, telling him it was a relic, 
With this finger she performed wonderful things. When 
she had lighted it—for such fingers burn like a candle 
—everyone in the house where she might be was put 
to sleep. She would then steal money and everything

else she fancied, till at last she was detected, and the 
stolen property found in her possession.! 
In a note to the passage quoted above from Southey’s 
‘Thalaba,’ it is mentioned that a somewhat similar prac- 
tice is recorded by Torquemada of Mexican thieves. 
They used to carry with them the left hand and arm 
of a-woman who had died in her first childbed; with 
this they twice struck the ground before the house ‘which 
they designed to rob, and the door twice, and the 
threshold twice : the inhabitants, if asleep, were hindered 
from waking by this charm, and if awake, were stupefied 
and ‘deprived of speech and motion while the fatal arm 
was in the house. 
But I have wandered a little from the subject of 
witchcraft proper. Let me return to it, and conclude 
with an incident more recent than the other illustrations 
Ihave adduced. I received it from a clerical friend, 
whose informant was a pupil in the house of the clergy- 
man referred to. 
In the autumn of the year 1851, a clergyman living 
in Rutlandshire gave a small party, to which a neigh- 
bour, also a country clergyman, brought his family and 
one young lady-visitor. During the evening, this young 
lady went upstairs into the bedroom of one of her host’s 
family, saw a gold watch hanging up on a nail, took it 
down, concealed it in her dress, joined the party again, 
and entered into the amusements of the evening. They 
dispersed in due time, and the young lady carried away 
the watch. When its owner retired to her room she at 
once missed it; enquiries were made, and even the 
police called in, but to no purpose. Suspicion fell, how- 
ever, upon a poor woman and her daughter, who had 
come in as helpers from the village, and this in spite of 
1 Thorpe’s Mythology, vol. iii. pp. 274, 275.
-P-A-G-E-235
THE WISE WOMAN OF LEICESTER. 207 © 
the excellent character they had always borne. These 
persons were much hurt at the accusation, and annoyed 
at the visits and searchings of the police; so after a few 
days they called in’ a wise woman from Leicester, who 
was famous for aiding to recover lost property. This wise 
woman was thrown into a mesmeric state byher husband. 
At first she was violent, but she gradually calmed down, 
and when they questioned her spoke as follows :— 
‘IT am going over hill and valley, and at length 
arrive ata village. I come to a gate, go through it into 
a yard, enter the house, and ascend the stairs.’ (She 
then described accurately the house and the room.) ‘I 
see a watch hanging on a nail. A short young lady ina 
pink dress, with dark hair, comes in, takes it, and puts 
it in her bosom. She goes away two miles. She is at 
this moment walking in a meadow with some children. 
The watch is in her bosom, and you will find it there; 
but you must be very quiet about it, for she is full of 
apprehension, and has been trying to get rid of the 
watch.’ : 
This history was brought to the family where the 
young lady was staying. The master of the house was 
not at all disposed to believe the circumstances, but 
seeing the poor people persuaded of their truth, he felt 
himself obliged to order an investigation, The young 
lady’s boxes were searched in vain, but on proceeding 
to a personal examination, the watch was found in the 
place specified. The wise woman had stated that this 
was not the first instance of appropriation on the young 
lady’s part, and here too she proved correct.

their way across the Cheviots, while the North of Eng- 
jand has unearthly denizens peculiarly its own. The 
Scotch peasant Barnaby, in the Ettrick Shepherd’s tale 
of the ‘ Woolgatherer’, speaks thus of the sprites of his 
country, and the popular belief in them of his day :— 
© Ye had need to tak care how ye dispute the existence 
of fairies, brownies, and apparitions: ye may as weel 
dispute the Gospel of Saint Matthew. We dunna 
believe in a’ the gomral fantastic bogles an’ spirits 
that fly light-headed folk up an’ down the countree ; 
but we believe in a’ the apparitions that warn o’ death, 
that save life, and that discover guilt. Ill tell you what 
we believe ye see. The deil and his adjents, they fash 
none butthe gude folk—the Cameronians and the prayin’ 
ministers an’sic-like. Then the bogles, they are a better 
kind o’ spirits; they meddle wi’ nane but the guilty; the 
murderer, an’ the mansworn, an’ the cheaters o’ the widow 
an’ fatherless, they do for them. Then the brownie, he’s

a kind of half-spirit, half-man; he’ll drudge, and do a’ 
the wark about the town for his meat, but then he'll 
do no wark but when he likes for a’ the king’s do- 
minions. That’s what we a’ believe here awa’ auld and 
young.’ 
Of the good old Brownie, however, that faithful ally 
of the Scottish household, I have little new to tell. 
He seems a denizen of the Shetland Islands, the High- 
jJands of Scotland, and the Western Isles, as well as of 
the Borderland. I must warn you, however, not to con~ 
found him with the Dobie, a creature of far less sense 
and activity. In fact, the Dobie was what I have heard 
& poor woman call her husband’s ghost, ‘a mortal heavy 
sprite? and hence the common Border phrases, ‘ Oh ye 
stupid Dobie!’ or ‘She’s but a senseless Dobie. The 
Brownie was therefore preferred as a guardian of hidden 
treasure, and to him did the Borderers commit their 
money or gouds, when, according to the custom prevalent 
in wild insecure countries, they concealed them in the 
earth. Some form of incantation was practised on the 
occasion, of which I can only learn one part-—the 
dropping upon the treasure the blood of a slaughtered 
animal, or burying the slain animal with it. 
The Brownie is believed in Berwickshire to be the 
ordained helper of mankind in the drudgery entailed 
by sin: hence he is forbidden to receive wages.2 He 
1 Sir Walter Scott seems unaware of this peculiar character of the 
Dobie. He considers it merely another name for the Barguest, of whom 
more hereafter; and metitions that he has been informed of some 
families of the name of Dobie, who carried in their armorial bearings a 
phantom or spectre passant. (Demonology and Witcheraft, Letter iii.) 
In a note to Canto 2 of Rokeby, he tolls of the Dobie of Mortham, who 
haunts Greta Dell; but calls it a female spectre, the ghost of a lady 
formerly murdered in the wood. 
2 Danish tradition goes so far back as to state the origin of the

is allowed his little treats, however, and the chief of 
these are knuckled cakes, made of meal warm from 
the mill, toasted over the embers and spread with honey. 
The housewife will prepare these, and lay them care- 
fully where he may find them by chance. When a tit- 
bit is given to a child, parents will still say to him, 
*There’s a piece wad please a Brownie.’ A bowl of 
cream was also a favourite dish. If a family desired to 
get rid of their inmate, they had only to lay out for him 
a new hood, and he would take leave of them, singing— 
‘A new mantle and a new hood 
Poor Brownie ! ye’ll ne’er do mair good.’ 
Thus, the goodman of the parish of Glendevon left 
out some clothes one night for the Brownie, and heard 
him take his departure during the night, saying, in a 
highly offended tone— 
~ *Gie Brownie coat, gie Brownie sark, 
Ye’se get nae mair o’ Brownie’s wark.’ 
A lady of Scottish extraction, Mrs. M. , Writes thus 
to me: ‘It is curious what dislike Brownies have to   
different kinds of sprites. It is said in Jutland, that when Our Lord 
cast the fullen angels out of heaven, some of them fell down on the 
mounds.or barrows, and becamo Barrow-folk, or (as they are also called) 
Mount-folk, or Hill-folk; others fell into the Elf-moors, and became the 
progenitors of the Elf-folk; while others fell into dwellings, from whom 
descend the domestic sprites or Nissir—the Brownies, in fact, Another 
Danish legend is as follows, While Eve was one day washing her 
children by a spring, Our Lord unexpectedly appeared before her; she 
was terrified, and concealed those of her children which were not yet. 
washed. Our Lord asked her if all her children were there, and to 
avoid His anger, in case He should see that all her children were not 
washed, she answered ‘Yes.’ Then Our Lord declared that what she 
had concealed from Him should thenceforth be concealed from mankind, 
and at the same moment the unclean children disappeared and were 
buried under the hills. Irom these descend all the underground folk— 
Trolls, Elfs, &e.—(Thorpe’s Mythology, vol. ii. p.115).

clothing. There was one in the old Peclhouse where I 
was born. The servants, out of gratitude for his assist- 
ance, gave him what they deemed an indispensable 
portion of man’s attire. Unfortunately it was part of 
a suit of livery, and he vanished, crying— 
“ Bed breeks and a ruffled sark ! 
Ye’ll no get me to do yer wark.” 
The story dates from my great-grandfather’s time; but 
the old dark closet where Brownie dwelt still exists, 
though dark no longer.’ 
But not the Brownie alone, with his kindred Northern 
sprites, is driven away by gifts of clothing. Devonshire 
Pixies are equally sensitive on this point. It is recorded 
that one of them on receiving a new suit vanished, 
exclaiming— 
‘Pixy fine, Pixy gay, 
Pixy now will run away.’ 
The little Swedish Tomtar too, though he will receive 
donations of bread, cheese, and even tobacco, is spoiled 
for work by new clothes; and when a housewife, in 
gratitude for the meal he sifted in her meal-tub, placed 
a suit for him on the edge of the tub, he did nothing 
more for her. He found that the meal damaged his © 
new kirtle, so he cast the sieve away and repeated— 
‘The young spark is fine, 
He dusts himself! 
Never more will he sift.’! 
And the Dutch Kaboutermannekin, or Redeap, on re- 
ceiving new clothes vanishes never to return. A miller 
in Kempnerland thus rewarded his Redcap, for a good 
deal of hard work expeditiously got through; but the

goblin, having put on the clothes and strutted about 
proudly in them, disappeared. The miller, missing his 
drudge, laid wait for him on a little bridge over a brook, 
which the Kaboutermannekin used to cross every even- 
ing. He watched the sprites as they passed, some 
clothed, some naked, and last of all came his household 
sprite in his new suit. ‘Haha! said the ‘miller, ‘have 
I got thee ?’ and was about to seize little Redcap, when 
a voice like that of his wife was heard from the rivulet, 
erying for help. The miller turned and jumped into the 
water, and in a moment all the mannekins were gone." 
Cranshaws, in Berwickshire, was once the abode of an 
industrious Brownie, who both saved the corn and 
thrashed it for several seasons. At length, after one 
harvest, some person thoughtlessly remarked, that the 
corn was not well mowed or piled up in the barn. The 
sprite took offence at this, and the next night threw the 
whole of the corn over the Raven Crag, a precipice 
about two miles off, muttering— 
‘It’s no weel mowed! It’s no weel mowed! 
Then it’s ne’er be mowed by me again; 
Tl scatter it owre the raven stane, 
And they'll hae some wark ere it’s mowed again.’ 
This little story is taken from Mr. George Hender- 
son’s ‘ Popular Rhymes of Berwickshire.’ It reminds us 
of the Manx Phynnoderee, who, when the farmer 
complained of his not cutting the grass sufficiently close 
to the ground, left the grumbler to cut it himself next 
year, but went after him stubbing up the roots so fast 
as almost to cut off the man’s legs. The Phynnoderee 
liked clothing as little as the Brownie, and once, when 
rewarded for special service by the present of a few

articles of dress, he lifted them up one by one, exclaim- 
ing,— . 
* Cap for the head! alas, poor head ! 
Coat for the back ! alas, poor back !” 
and so on, till, with a melancholy wail, he departed, 
never to return. Both sprites, like Milton’s ‘ drudging 
goblin,’ delighted in the ‘ cream-bow! duly set,’ but the 
Brownie at least would have resented the charge of 
labouring to ‘earn’ it. Sir Walter Scott relates how 
the last Brownie in Ettrick Forest, the Brownie of 
Bodsbeck, vanished when the mistress of the house 
placed a porringer of milk and a piece of money in his 
haunts. He was heard to howl, and cry all night ¢ Fare- 
well bonnie Bodsbeck !’ and in the morning disappeared 
for ever.''| The Ettrick Shepherd has given the title of 
the ‘ Brownie of Bodsbeck’ to a tale, in which an exiled 
Cameronian assumes the character of this mysterious 
being, and thereby gains shelter and support. 
If the Scottish homesteads have their attendant sprites, 
the wild moorlands are not without their mysterious 
denizens, In a letter from Mr. Surtees to Sir W. Scott, 
given in the memoir prefixed to vol. iv. of Surtees’ 
‘ History of Durham,’ we read, on the authority of an old 
dame, named Elizabeth Cockburn, how inthe year before 
the Great Rebellion, two young men from Newcastle 
were sporting on the high moors above Elsdon, and at 
last sat down to refresh themselves in a green glen near 
a mountain stream. The younger lad went to drink at 
the brook, and raising his head again saw the ‘Brown 
man‘ of the Muirs,’ a dwarf very strong and stoutly 
built, his dress brown like withered bracken, his head 
covered with frizzled red hair, his countenance ferocious, 
and his eyes glowing like those of a bull.. After some

parley, in which the stranger reproved the hunter for 
trespassing on his demesnes and slaying the creatures 
who were his subjects, and informed him how he him- 
self lived only on whortleberries, nuts, and apples, he 
invited him home, The youth was on the point of 
accepting the invitation and springing across the brook, 
when he was arrested by the voice of his companion, 
who thought he had tarried long, and looking round 
again ‘the wee Brown man was fied.’ It was thought 
that had the young man crossed the water the dwarf 
would have torn him to pieces. As it was he died 
within the year, in consequence, it was supposed, of-his 
slighting the dwarf’s admonition, and continuing his 
sport on the way home. 
Killmoulis is a peculiar species of Brownie, who haunts 
the mill, and resides in the killogee, or space before the 
fireplace in the kiln. One would suppose that he took 
his name from the kiln, but Mr. Wilkie considers ‘kill? 
to be a corruption of ¢ gill,’ and ‘ killmoulis’ to mean the 
miller’s servant. This sprite is a singular creature, for 
he appears to have no mouth; yet the following rhymes 
testify to his taste for swine’s-flesh :— 
Auld Killmoulis wanting the mow, 
Come to me now, come to me now! 
Where war ye yestreen when I killed the-sow ? 
Had ye come ye’d hae gotten yer belly fou. 
Killmoulis takes the liveliest interest in the miller and 
his mill, Should any misfortune threaten them he will 
wail piteously. At the same time he often torments the 
goodman sorely by throwing ‘isles’ or ashes out when 
sheelin or shelled oats are spread out to dry; nor will 
he leave off his mischievous tricks till the miller calls out, 
‘Auld Killmoulis wanting the mow, 
Come to me now,’
-P-A-G-E-243
KILLMOULIS. 215 
on which he appears, puffing and blowing, in the shape 
of an old man, the mouth wanting, but with an enor- 
mous nose. 
Killmoulis will never quit the ‘ogee,’ his favourite 
corner, except to thrash the corn in great emergency, 
or to ride for the Howdie, when the miller’s wife needs 
her services—an errand he will fulfil expeditiously 
enough, though with some rough usage of the horse. 
It appears from ‘Thorpe’s Mythology’ (vol. iii. p. 187), 
that the mills of Holland are haunted too, but by 
sprites of a more friendly character, bearing the un- 
wieldy name of Kaboutermannekins. In the village 
of Gelrode, when the millstone was worn, the miller had 
only to lay it before his mill at night, together with a 
slice of bread and butter and a glass of beer, and he was 
sure to find it in the morning beautifully set. 
Every mill was haunted by its own Killmoulis; hence 
the number of wild stories which linger round these 
secluded spots. In Roxburghshire Killmoulis is thus 
drawn into the spell of the ‘blue clue,’ a divination prac- 
tised on A}l-hallowe’en and at other times. You must 
throw the clue into a pot alone in the gloaming, and 
wind the worsted on a new clue. Towards the end of 
the winding Killmoulis will hold the thread. You 
must ask ‘Wha holds?’ and he will snort out the name ~ 
of your future spouse. 
Redcap, Redcomb, or Bloody Cap, is a sprite of 
another sort from the friendly Brownie. He is cruel 
and malignant of mood, and resides in spots which were 
once the scene of tyranny—such as Border castles, towers, 
and Peelhouses. He is depicted as a short thickset 
old man, with long prominent teeth, skinny fingers 
armed with talons like eagles, large eyes of a fiery-red 
colour, grisly hair streaming down his shoulders, iron

boots, a pikestaff in his left hand, and a red cap on his 
head. When benighted or shelterless travellers take 
refuge in his haunts, he flings huge stones at them; nay, 
unless he is much maligned, he murders them outright, 
and catches their blood in his cap, which thus acquires 
its crimson hue. 
This ill-conditioned goblin may, however, be driven 
away by repeating Scripture words, or holding up the 
_ Cross; he will then yell dismally, or vanish in a flame 
of fire, leaving behind him a large tooth on the spot 
where he was last seen. 
Now here we plainly have the ‘ Redcap sly’ who sat 
in Hermitage Castle with the evil Lord Soulis, sorcerer 
and tyrant alike, and Warden of the South and West 
Marshes. To him Redcap said: 
‘While thou shalt bear a charmed life, 
And hold that life of me, 
*Gainst lance and arrow, sword and kmife, 
I shall thy warrant be. 
‘Nor forged steel, nor hempen band 
Shall e’er thy limbs confine ; 
Till threefold ropes of sifted sand 
Around thy body twine.’ 
And when the evil lord was taken, and by the aid of 
Michael Scott’s book ‘true Thomas’ shaped the ropes 
‘sae curiously,’ we are told that— 
Redcap sly unseen was hy, 
And the ropes would neither twist nor turn, 
It was, however, beyond Redcap’s power to save his 
Jord from his final doom, and, as the spae-book directed, 
Lord Soulis was boiled to death in a brazen cauldron, 
on the Nine-stane Rig. 
I find this goblin referred to in an old proverb given
-P-A-G-E-245
REDCAP. 217 
in the Denham Tracts: ‘He caps Bogie, Bogie capt Red- 
cap, and Redcap capt Old Nick.’ And Sir Walter Scott 
says of him: ‘Redcap is a popular appellation of that 
class of spirits which haunt old castles. Every ruined 
tower in the South of Scotland is supposed to have an 
inhabitant of this species.”! 
Mr. Wilkie has recorded the following lines, which he 
calls a common song about Redcap :— 
Now Redcap he was there, 
And he was there indeed ; 
And grimly he gimed and glowed, 
Wi’ his red cowl on his head. 
Then Redcap gave a yell, 
It was a yell indeed ; 
That the flesh neath my oxter grew cauld, 
It grew as cauld as lead. 
Auld Bluidie cow] ga’ed a girn 
It was a girn indeed ; 
Syne my flesh it grew mizzled for fear, 
And I stood like a thing that is dead. 
Last Redcowl gave a laugh, 
It was a laugh indeed ; 
"Twas mair like a hoarse, hoarse scrough, 
Syne a tooth fell out o’ his head. 
There are Redcaps in Holland too, but they have 
little in common with the Scottish Redcap, except the 
name. They are nearer akin to the Brownie, whom 
they resemble in their attachment to certain homesteads, 
in the diligence with which they perform manual labour, 
and in their abrupt departure on receiving a guerdon in 
the form of clothing. The Dutch Redcaps light fires 
during the night, which are invisible save to themselves, 
but warm the house; and the few sticks they leave of the 
Hausfrau’s stock of brushwood, serve her as long as a great 
) Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border, vol. iv. p. 248.

bundle, and give double the warmth. They are clad in 
red from head to foot, and have green hands and faces. 
A Redeap once made the fortune of a poor man by 
doing all the work of his little farm, and especially by 
churning at night more butter than anyone else could 
get from the milk. The man became possessor of a 
whole herd of cows, and laid up a stocking-full of shining 
dollars. But, prosperity corrupting him, he grew idle 
and dissolute, and finally abused Redcap, and threw the 
bundle of firewood prepared for him by the gudewife 
into the well. On this the sprite disappeared; the wife 
was seized with illness, the stocking was only filled with 
coals, the cows died, and all went to ruin. The peasant 
begged and prayed that Redcap would return, but to no 
purpose; he was only answered by the laughs and jeers 
of the goblin outside the cottage. 
Powries, or Dunters, are also sprites who inhabit forts, 
old castles, peel-towers, or dungeons ; and they constantly 
make a noise there as of beating flax, or bruising barley 
in the hollow of a stone. If this sound is. longer or 
louder than usual, it portends a death or misfortune. 
Popular tradition reports that the foundation-stones of 
“these old Border castles were bathed with human blood 
by their builders the Picts; no wonder then that they 
were haunted in some way or other! - 
Wag-at-the-wa’, another Border sprite, is mentioned 
in the following verses, which Mr. Wilkie took down 
from the recitation of an old lady in the village of 
Bowden, Roxburghshire :— 
Wag-at-the-wa’ went out i’ the night, 
To see that the moon was shining bricht, 
The moon she was at the latter fa,’ i 
“Gang hame to yere beds!’ cried Wag-at-the-wa’. 
1 Thorpe’s Mythology, vol. iii. p. 181.
-P-A-G-E-247
WAG-AT-THE-WA’, 219 
‘Why d’ye wag, the witch nickit crook, 
‘When the pyet’s asleep where the corbies they rook, 
Hell’s e’en shimmert on ye i’ the moon’s latter fa’, 
And ruins fell cooter will harrie ye a’, 
I maun gae fra’ ye, tak tent what I say, 
Gae tear frae the sowie an armfu’ o’ hay, 
Filing wisps i’ the fire till it mak’ a red low, 
Frae the eizels will rise up a dead man’s pow. 
‘The pow will stare ugsome, but dinna heed that, 
Thud fast o’ the wisps, and beware o’ the cat, 
For she will yer fae be, wi’ teeth and wi’ claw, 
An’ her mewing will soon warn auld Wag-at-the-wa.’ 
‘Whenever the e’en holes wi’ low sall be fou, 
Then is the time that we maun dread the pow, 
For Hell’s e’en are firelike and fearfu’ to view, 
And they oft change their colour fra’ dark red to blue. 
They pierce like an elf, prick ilk ane that they see, 
Then beware o’ their shimmer, if yer seen ye will dee, 
Your heart’s pulse will riot, your flesh will grow cauld, 
Oh, how happy the wight that draws breath till he’s auld! 
Then fly frae the house, to the green quick repair, 
And Wag-at-the-wa’ will full soon meet ye there, 
As ye kneel ‘neath the Rood and mutter yer prayer... 
These obscure lines do not give us much information 
respecting Wag-at-the-wa’. We are told elsewhere, how- 
ever, that he is a sort of Brownie, who presided over 
the Border kitchen, where he acted family monitor, but 
was a torment to the servants, especially to the kitchen- 
maid. His seat was by the hearth, or on the crook ot 
bar of iron, terminating in alarge hook, which may be 
seen in old houses hanging by a swivel from a beam in 
the chimney to hold pots and kettles. Whenever the 
crook was empty, Wag-at-the-wa’ would take possession 
of it, and swing there with great complacency, only 
absenting himself when there was a death in the family:
-P-A-G-E-248
220 LOCAL SPRITES. 
He was fond of children and of household mirth, and 
hence his attachment to the ingle. When droll stories 
were told his laugh might be heard distinctly; but if he 
heard of any liquor being drunk, except home-brewed 
ale, he would cough and be displeased. 
His general appearance was that of a grisly old map, 
with short crooked legs, while a long tail assisted him 
in keeping his seat on the crook. Sometimes he 
appeared in a grey mantle, with the remains of an old 
* pirnicap’ on his head, drawn down over that side -of 
the face which was troubled with toothache, a constant 
grievance of his; but he commonly worea red coat and 
blue breeches, both garments being made of ‘ familie 
woo.’ 
Altogether there is something uncannie about this 
ancient sprite, and the mode of his disappearance (for 
he has passed away from the Scottish ingle) does not 
speak well for him. A deep cut is now invariably made 
in the iron of the crook in the form of a cross, and is 
called the witches’ mark, because it warns witches from 
the fire. This sign also scares away auld Wag-at-the- 
wa’, and keeps him from touching the crook. Still it 
is deemed wrong and foolish ever to wag the crook, 
since it is a sort of invitation to the sprite to return. 
Mr. Wilkie says that he has seen a visitor rise up and 
leave the house, because one of the boys of the family 
idly swung the crook: she was so horrified at this 
‘invokerie ’ that she declared ‘she wad na abide in the 
house where it was practised.’ 
Mr. Wilkie says that the sign of the Cross was in like 
manner marked on many tools and utensils, down to the 
“torwoodie’ of the harrow, as a protection against sprites 
of doubtful character-—a singular preservative in Presby- 
terian Scotland! In many parts of England, however,
-P-A-G-E-249
RABETROT. 221 
we find an analogous use of this sign. The Durham 
butchers mark it on the shoulder of a sheep or lamb 
after taking off the skin, the housewives on their loaves 
of bread before placing them in the oven. In the West 
of England, I believe, the Cross is more commonly made 
on the dough when set to rise. 
In the old days, when spinning was the constant 
employment of women, the spinning-wheel had its pre- 
siding genius or fairy. Her Border name was Habetrot, 
and Mr. Wilkie tells the following legend about her :— 
A Selkirkshire matron had one fair daughter, who 
loved play better than work, wandering in the meadows 
and lanes better than the spinning-wheel and distaff. 
The mother was heartily vexed at this taste, for in those 
days no Jassie had any chance of a good husband unless 
she was an industrious spinster. So she cajoled, 
threatened, even beat her daughter, but all to no 
purpose ; the girl remained what her mother called her, 
“an idle cutie” 
At last, one spring morning, the gudewife gave her 
seven heads of lint, saying she would take no excuse; 
they must be returned in three days spun into yarn. 
The girl saw her mother was in earnest, so she plied 
her distaff as well as she could ; but her little hands were 
all untaught, and by the evening of the second day a very 
small part of her task was accomplished. She cried 
herself to sleep that night, and in the morning, throwing 
aside her work in despair, she strolled out into the fields, 
all sparkling with dew. At last she reached a flowery 
knoll, at whose feet ran a little burn, shaded with 
woodbine and wild roses; and there she sat down, burying 
her face in her hands. When she looked up, she was 
surprised to see by the margin of the stream an old 
woman, quite unknown to her, ‘drawing out the thread’
-P-A-G-E-250

as she basked in the sun. There was nothing very re~ 
markable in her appearance, except the length and 
thickness of her lips, only she was seated on a self- 
bored stone. The girl rose, went to the good dame,and 
gave her a friendly greeting, but could not help en- 
quiring what made her so ‘long lipit” ‘Spinning 
thread, ma hinnie, said the old woman, pleased with 
her friendliness, and by no means resenting the personal 
remark. It must be noticed that spinners used con- 
stantly to wet their fingers with their lips, as they drew 
the thread from the rock or distaff. ‘Ah!’ said the girl, 
“I should be spinning too, but it’s a’ to no purpose, I 
sall ne’er do my task ;’ on which the old woman pro- 
posed to do it for her. Overjoyed, the maiden ran to 
fetch her lint, and placed it in her new friend’s hand, 
asking her name, and where she should call for the yarn 
in the evening; but she received no reply; the old 
woman’s form passed away from her among the trees 
and bushes, and disappeared. The girl, much bewildered, 
wandered about a little, sat down to rest, and finally 
fell asleep by the little kaoll. : 
When she awoke she was surprised to find that it was 
evening. The glories of the western sky were passing 
into twilight grey. Causleen, or the evening star, was 
beaming with silvery light, soon to be lost in the moon’s 
increasing splendour. While watching these changes, 
the maiden was startled by the sound of au uncouth 
voice, which seemed to issue from below a self-bored 
stone, close beside her. She laid her ear to the stone, 
and distinctly heard these words: ‘ Little kens the wee 
lassie on the brae-head that ma name’s Habetrot.’ Then 
looking down the hole she saw her friend, the old dame, 
walking backwards and forwards in a deep cavern 
among a group of spinsters all seated on colludie stones
-P-A-G-E-251
_ RABETROT. 223 
(a kind of white pebble found in rivers), and busy with 
distaff and spindle. An unsightly company they were, 
with lips more or less disfigured by their employment, 
as were old Habetrot’s. The same peculiarity extended 
to another of the sisterhood, who sat in a distant corner 
reeling the yarn; and she was marked, in addition, by 
grey eyes, which seemed starting from her head, and a 
long hooked nose. . 
While the girl was still watching, she heard Habetrot 
address this singular being by the name of Scantlie Mab, 
and tell her to bundle up the yarn, for it was time the 
young lassie should give it to her mother. Delighted 
to hear this, our listener got up and turned homewards, 
nor was she long kept in suspense. Habetrot soon over- 
took her, and placed the yarn in her hands. * Oh, what 
can I do for ye in return?’ exclaimed she, in delight. 
“Naething —naething,’ replied the dame; ‘ but dinna tell 
yer mither whae spun the yarn,’ 
Scarcely crediting her good fortune, our heroine went 
home, where she found her mother had been busy 
making sausters, or black puddings, and hanging them 
up in the lum to dry, and then, tired out, had retired 
to rest. Finding herself very hungry after her long day 
on the knoll, the girl took down pudding after pudding, 
fried and ate them, and at last went.to bed too. The 
mother was up first the next morning, and when she 
came into the kitchen and found her sausters all gone, 
and the seven hanks of yarn lying beautifully smooth 
and bright upon the table, her mingled feelings of vexa- 
tion and delight were too much for her. She ran out o! 
the house wildly, crying out— 
‘Ma daughter's spun se’en, se’en, se’en, 
Ma daughter's eaten se’en, se’en, se’en, 
And all before daylight!”
-P-A-G-E-252
    224 LOCAL SPRITES, 
A lard, who chanced to be riding by, heard the excla~ 
mation, but could not understand it; so he rode up and 
asked the gudewife what was the matter, on which she 
broke out again— 
‘Ma daughter's spun se’en, se’en, se’en, 
Ma daughter’s eaten se’en, ae’en, se’en 
before daylight ; and if ye dinna believe me, why come 
in and see it’ The laird’s curiosity was roused; he 
alighted and went into the cottage, where he saw the 
yarn, and admired it so much, he begged to see the 
spinner. 
The mother dragged in the blushing girl. Her rustic 
_ grace soon won his heart, and he avowed he was lonely 
without a wife, and had long been in search of one who 
was a good spinner. So their troth was plighted, and 
the wedding took place soon afterwards, the bride stifling 
her apprehensions that she should not prove so deft at 
her spinning-wheel as her lover expected. And once 
more old Habetrot came to her aid. Whether the good 
dame, herself so notable, was as indulgent to all idle 
_ damsels does not appear—certainly she did not fail this 
little pet of hers. ‘ Bring your bonnie bridegroom to 
my cell,” said she to the young bride soon after her 
marriage; ‘he shall see what comes o’ spinning, and 
never will he tie you to the spinning-wheel.’ 
Accordingly the bride led her husband the next day 
to the flowery knoll, and bade him look through the self- 
bored stone. Great was his surprise to behold Habetrot 
dancing and jumping over her rock, singing all the time 
this ditty to her sisterhood, while they kept time with 
their spindles :— 
We who live in dreary den, 
' Are both rank and foul to see;
-P-A-G-E-253
HABETROT. 225: 
Hidden frae the glorious sun,. 
That teems the fair earth’s canopie : 
Ever must our evenings lone 
Be spent on the colludie stone. 
.Cheerless is the evening grey, 
‘When. Causleen hath died away, 
But ever bright and ever fair, 
Are they who breathe this evening air ; 
And lean upon the self-bored. stone 
Unseen by all but me alone. 
The song ended, Scantlie Mab asked Habetrot what 
she meant by her last line, ‘Unseen by all but me 
alone.’ ‘There is ane,’ replied Habetrot, ‘ whom I bid 
to come here at this hour, and he has heard my song 
through the self-bored stone.” So saying she rose, 
opened another door, which was concealed by the roots 
of an old tree, and invited the bridal pair to come in 
and see her family. 
The laird was astonished at the weird-looking com- 
pany, as he well might be, and enquired of one after 
another the cause of the strange distortion of their lips. 
In a different tone of voice, and with a different twist of 
the mouth, each answered that it was occasioned by 
spinning. At least they tried to say so, but one grunted 
out * Nakasind,’ and another ‘ Owkasaiind,’ while a third 
murmured ‘Q-a-a-send.’ All, however, conveyed the 
fact to the bridegroom’s understanding; while Habe 
trot slily hinted that if his wife were allowed to spin, 
her pretty lips would grow out of shape too, and her 
pretty face get an ugsome look. So before he left the 
cave he protested his little wife should never touch a 
spinning-wheel, and he kept his word. She used to 
wander in the meadows by his side, or ride behind him

over the hills, and all the flax grown on his land was 
sent to old Habetrot to be converted into yarn.! 
Such are the tales of Border sprites which Mr, Wilkte 
has collected. He adds that the villages of Bowden and 
Gateside had a strange belief that on a certain night in 
the year (thence. called ‘Cowlug e’en’) a number of 
sprites were abroad with ears resembling those of cows 5 
but he could not discover the origin of the belief, nor 
which night was thus distinguished. . 
He mentions also that in the South of Scotland, every 
person was supposed to be attended by a sprite, who had 
the power of taking away his life—a strange perversion 
of the doctrine of Guardian Angels. This is called by 
the old name of ‘Thrumpin, and is mentioned in these 
obscure verses :— 
When the hullers o’ night are loosin’, 
“When the quakers are crumplin eerie; 
‘When the moon is in the latter fa’, 
When the owlets are scraughin drearie ; 
When the elleried are clumperin, 
‘When the toweries hard are thrumpin, 
‘When the bawkie bird he kisses the yud, 
Then, then’s the time for thrumpin. 
1 This story, though not without variations, is radically the same as 
the three spinners of German household tales—-Grimm, K.M. 14; 
Pretorius Gluckstopf, 404; Peschock Nachrichten, i. 355; Mullen- 
hoff, No. 8. In Sweden we find the samo story (see ‘Cavaliers,’ p. 214) ; 
also in Norway (Asbgérnsen, p. 69); and again in the collection of 
Neapolitan Household Tales, made by Basile, in the seventeenth century : 
we meet with it too in Lithuania (Schleicher, p. 12). The outline of the 
plot in all is as follows. A poor woman beats her daughter for idle- 
ness, and tells a merchant who is passing that she does it to compel her 
daughter to spin six hanks of yarn. The merchant at once proposes for 
the daughter, marries her, and then sets her to spin a large quantity of 
yarn during his absence on a journey. She is assisted by a fairy, who 
deceives the husband into forbidding his wife to spin any more.—S. B.G.

THE DUNNIE. 227 
And gif ye miss the mystic hour, 
‘When vengeful sprites are granted power, 
To thrump ilk faithless wight ; 
The heayens will gloom like a wizard smile 
An’ the foremost will dim his carcase vile 
Fra’ all uncannie sight. 
For man and beast by the three stones light, 
Hae little chance to thrive ; 
Till the sixty are past, and not till the last, 
Can man and beast survive. 
T have lately heard, from a clerical friend, of a strange 
Northumbrian sprite, who had been entirely passed over 
in any accounts of Northern folk-lore to which I have had 
access. This sprite is called the Dunnie; he appears to 
be of the Brownie type, and is located at Haselrigg, in - 
the parish of Chatton, in Northumberland. Like others 
of his race, he is much addicted to mischievous, trouble- 
some tricks, such as the following, in which he frequently 
indulges. 
When the midwife is wanted in a farmer’s family, 
and the master goes out to saddle his horse that he may 
fetch her, the Dunnie will take-its form. The false 
creature carries him safely, receives the midwife also on 
his back behind the farmer ; but on their return, in the 
muddiest part of the road, he will suddenly vanish, and 
leave the unhappy pair floundering in the mud. Or, 
again, when the ploughman has (as he believes) caught 
his horse in the field, brought him home, and harnessed 
him, he will, to his dismay, see the harness come ‘slap 
to the ground,’ while the steed kicks up his heels and 
starts across the country like the wind. 
Some years ago, the Dunnie was often seen wander- 
ing among the crags of the Cheviots, and heard repeat- 
ing the following verse again and again, in a melancholy 
voice :— 
a2
-P-A-G-E-256

Cocken heugh there’s gear enough, 
" Collier heugh there’s mair, ~ 
For I’ve lost the key o’ the Bounders, 
An’ I’m ruined for evermair. 
Hence it has been thought that the Dunnie is really 
the ghost of a ‘reiver,’ who had hoarded his ill-gotten 
pelf in those crags, and therefore haunts them constantly. 
In Mr. James Hardy’s paper on ‘Legends respecting: 
Huge Stones’, the third line runs, ‘ I’ve lost the key 0” 
the Bowden-door,’ which corresponds still better with 
this legend. 
In my own county we have a sprite of a more benign 
character. He bears the homely name of Hob, and 
resides in Hobhole, a natural cavern in Runswick Bay, 
which is formed, like the fairy caves near Hartlepool 
and the recesses near Sunderland, by the. action of the 
tides. He was supposed to cure the whooping-cough, 
so parents would take children suffering from that com- 
plaint into the cave, and in a low voice invoke him 
thus: 
Hobhole Hob! 
Ma’ bairn’s gotten ’t kink cough, 
Tak’t off! tak’t off! 
Another sprite, called Hob Headless, infested the road. 
between Hurworth and Neasham, but could not cross 
the Kent, a little stream flowing into the Tées at the 
latter place. He has been exorcised, however, and laid 
under a large stone, formerly on the roadside, for ninety- 
nine years and a day. Should any luckless person sit 
on that stone, he would be unable to quit it for ever. 
There is yet a third Hob at Coniscliffe, near Darling- 
ton, but I have not been able to gain any information 
about him. 
The River Tees has its sprite, called Peg Powler, a  
-P-A-G-E-257
THE CAULP LAD OF HILTON. 229 
sort of Lorelei, with green tresses, and an insatiable de- 
sire for human life. She is said to lure people to her 
subaqueous haunts, and then drown or devour them. 
The foam or froth, which is often seen floating on the 
higher portion of the river in large masses, is called ‘Peg 
Powler’s suds ;’ the finer less sponge-like froth is called 
“Peg Powler’s cream.’ Mr. Denham tells us that children 
are still warned from playing on the banks of the Tees, 
especially on Sundays, by threats that Peg Powler will 
drag them into the water; and he pleads guilty to having 
experienced great terror whenever, as a boy, he found 
himself alone by the haunted stream. The River Skerne 
too has a goblin or sprite, but of what character I have 
not learned. 
The counties of Northumberland 4nd Durham are 
certainly peculiarly rich in tricksy spirits. There is 
the Cauld Lad of Hilton, who haunted Hilton Castle in 
the Valley of the Wear. Seldom seen, he was heard 
night after night by the servants. If they left the 
kitchen in order, he would amuse himself by hurling 
everything wildly about; if they left it in confusion, he 
would arrange everything with the greatest care. 
Harmless as he seemed, the servants got tired of him; 
so they laid agreen cloak and hood before the kitchen- 
fire, and set themselves to watch the result. At mid- 
night the ‘Cauld Lad’ glided in, surveyed the garments, 
put them on, frisked about, and when the cock crew, 
disappeared, saying : 
‘ Tere’s a cloak, and there’s a hood, 
The Cauld Lad of Hilton will do no more good.’ 
All this bespeaks him a sprite of the Brownie type; still 
he is, in the neighbourhood, deemed the ghost of a ser- 
vant-boy, slain by an old baron of Hilton, in a moment

of passion, The baron, it is said, ordered his horse to 
be ready at a particular time, waited for it in vain, went 
to the stable, found the lad asleep, and struck him a 
blow with a hayfork, which killed him. The baron, it 
is added, covered the victim with straw till night, and. 
then threw him into a pond, where indeed the skeleton 
of a boy was discovered years afterwards. Some verses, 
said to be sung by the Cauld Lad at dead of night, cer- 
tainly accord well with the notion of his being a ghost: 
‘Wae’s me, wac’s me, 
The acorn’s not yet 
Fallen from the tree, 
That’s to grow the wood ; 
That's to make the cradle, 
Phat’s to rock the bain, 
That’s to grow to a man, 
That’s to lay me! 
A friend of mine, born and brought up in the Borders, 
tells me of another Cauld Lad, of whom she heard in her 
childhood, during a visit to Gilsland, in Cumberland. 
He perished from cold, at the behest of some cruel 
uncle or stepdame ; and ever after his ghost haunted the 
family, coming shivering to their bedsides before any 
one was stricken by illness, his teeth audibly chattering; 
or, if it were to be fatal, laying his icy hand upon the 
part which would be the seat of disease, saying, 
 Cauld, cauld, aye cauld, 
An’ ye’se be cauld for evermair !’ 
About eighty or ninety years ago, the quiet village of 
Black Heddon, near Stamfordham, in Northumberland, 
was greatly disturbed by a supernatural being, popularly 
called Silky, from the nature of her robes. She was 
remarkable for the suddenness with which she would

appear to benighted travellers, breaking forth upon thém, 
in dazzling splendour, in the darkest and most lonely 
parts of the road. If he were on horseback, she would 
seat herself behind him, ‘ rustling in her silks,’ accom- 
pany him a certain distance, and then as suddenly dis- 
appear, leaving the bewildered countryman in blank 
amazement. 
Silky had a favourite resort at Belsay, two or three 
miles from Black Heddon, on a romantic crag beauti- 
fully studded with trees, under whose shadow she would 
wander all night. The bottom of this crag is washed 
by a picturesque little lake, at whose outlet is a water- 
fall, over which a fine old tree spreads its waving 
branches, forming by their intersection a sort of ‘chair. 
In this Silky loved to sit, rocked to repose by the wild 
winds, and it is still called Silky’s Chair; Sir Charles 
M. L, Monck, the present proprietor of the place, pre- 
serving the tree carefully, on account of the legend. 
This sprite exercised a marvellous power over the 
brute creation, arresting horses in their daily work, and 
keeping them still as long as she was so minded. Once 
she waylaid a waggon bringing coals to a farm near 
Black Heddon, and fixed the team upon a bridge, since 
called, after her, ‘Silky’s Brig” . Do what he would, the 
driver could not make the horses move a step, and there 
they would have stood all night had not another farm- 
servant fortunately come up with some ‘witchwood ’ 
(mountain-ash) about him. He went to the horses, and 
they moved on at once, but never did their driver dare 
to go abroad again without being well armed with witch- 
wood, 
In some respects Silky showed a family likeness to 
the Brownies. Like them she would, during the night, 
tidy a disorderly house; but if cannie decent people had

cleaned their rooms, and arranged them neatly, especially 
on a Saturday afternoon, the wayward sprite would dis- 
arrange everything as soon as they were gone to bed, 
so that on Sunday morning all would be in the wildest 
confusion. : 
Silky disappeared from her haunts very suddenly. 
One day a female servant, ‘being alone in one of the 
rooms of a house at Black Heddon, was terribly fright- 
ened by the ceiling above suddenly giving way, and a black 
mass falling through it with a crash upon the floor. She 
instantly fled out of the room, screaming at the pitch of 
her voice, ‘The devil’s in the house !—-the devil’s in the 
house! He’s come through the ceiling!’ The family 
collected around her in some alarm, and at first no one 
dared enter the room; when the mistress at last ven- 
tured to go in, she found on the floor a large rough skin 
filled with gold. From this time Silky was never more 
heard or seen, so it was believed that she was the 
troubled phantom of some person who had died mise- 
rable because she owned treasure, and was overtaken by 
her mortal agony before she had disclosed its hiding- 
place. The Rev. J. F. Bigge relates, however, that an 
old woman named Pearson, of Welton Mill, whom he 
visited on her deathbed, told him, a few days before her 
death, that she had seen Silky the night before, sitting 
at the bottom of her bed, all dressed in silk. 
Mr. James. Hardy, Silky’s historian, to whom I am 
indebted for these particulars respecting the wayward 
sprite, tells me of three sister spirits, also clad in silk 
attire. One is the family apparition of the mansion of 
Houndwood, in Berwickshire, and bears the quaint name 
of ‘Chappie.’ A knocking was repeatedly heard at the 
front-door of this house, but only on one occasion was 
anyone seen. Then a grand lady swept in, and went
-P-A-G-E-261
THE PICKTREE BRAG. 233 
up the staircase, but was never seen again in or out of 
the house. Denton Hall, near Newcastle, was also 
haunted by a female form, clad in rustling silks, and 
so was a shady avenue near North Shields. This last 
Silky was thought to be the ghost of a lady who was 
mistress to the profligate Duke of Argyle in the reign 
of William JIL, and died suddenly, not without sus- 
picions of murder, at Chirton, near Shields, one of his 
residences. The Banshee of Loch Nigdal, too, was 
arrayed in a silk dress, green in colour. All these 
traditions date from a period when silk was not in com- 
mon use, and therefore attracted notice in country 
places. 
Sir Cuthbert Sharpe, in his ‘Bishoprick Garland,’ 
tells us of the Picktree Brag, a spirit as mischievous 
and uncannie as the Dunnie, who appeared in widely 
different shapes on different occasions. Sometimes it 
was like a calf, with a white handkerchief round its 
neck, and a bushy tail; sometimes, in form of a coach- 
horse, it trotted ‘along the lonin afore folks, settin’ up 
a great nicker and a whinny now and then.’ Again it 
appeared as a ‘dick-ass,’ as four men holding up a white 
sheet, or as a naked man without a head. Sir Cuth- 
bert’s informant, an ancient dame, told him how her 
uncle had a white suit of clothes, and the first time he 
ever put them on he met the Brag, and never did he put 
them on again but some misfortune befel him. Once, 
in that very suit, returning from a christening, he en- 
countered the Brag, and being a bold man, he leapt 
upon its back; ‘but when he came to the four lonin 
ends, the Brag joggled him so sore, that he could hardly 
keep his seat; and at last it threw him into the middle 
o’ the pond, and ran away, setting up a great nicker and 
laugh, just for all the world like a Christian.’

The Hedley Kow was a bogie, mischjevous rather 
than malignant, which haunted the village of Hedley, 
near Ebchester. His appearance was never very alarm- 
ing, and he used to end his frolics with a horselaugh at 
the expense of his victims. He would present himself 
to some old dame gathering sticks, in the form of a 
truss of straw, which she would be sure to take up and 
carry away. ‘Then it would become so heavy she would 
have to lay her burden down, on which the straw would. 
become ‘quick,’ rise upright, and shuffle away before 
her, till at last it vanished from her sight with a laugh 
and shout. Again, in the shape of a favourite cow, the 
sprite would lead the milkmaid a long chase round the 
field, and after kicking and routing during milking- 
time would upset the pail, slip clear of the tie, and 
vanish with a loud laugh. Indeed, the ‘ Kow’ must 
have been a great nuisance in a farmhouse, for it 
is said to have constantly imitated the voice of the 
servant-girl’s lovers, overturned the kail-pot, given the 
cream to the cats, unravelled the knitting, or put the 
spinning-wheel out of ordér. But the sprite made 
himself most obnoxious at the birth of a child. He 
would torment the man who rode for the howdie, 
frightening the horse, and often making him upset both 
messenger and howdie, and leave them in the road. 
Then he would mock the gudewife, and when her angry 
husband rushed out with a stick to drive away the 
‘Kow’ from door or window, the stick would be snatched 
from him, and lustily applied to his own shoulders. 
Two adventures with the Hedley Kow are thus re- 
lated. A farmer named Forster, who lived near Hedley, 
went out into the field one morning, and caught, as he 
believed, his own grey horse. After putting the harness 
on, and yoking him to the cart, Forster was about to
-P-A-G-E-263
THE HEDLEY kKow. 235 
drive off, when the creature slipped away from the lim- 
mers ‘like a knotless thread, and set up a great nicker 
as he flung up his heels and scoured away, revealing 
himself clearly as the Hedley Kow. Again, two young 
men of Newlands, near Ebchester, went out one evening 
to meet their sweethearts: and arriving at the trysting- 
place, saw them, as it appeared, a short distance before 
them. , The girls walked on for two or three miles; the 
lads followed, quite unable to overtake them, till at last 
they found themselves up to the knees in a bog, and 
their beguilers vanished, with a loud Ha! ha! The 
young men got clear of the mire and ran homewards, 
as fast as they could, the bogie at their heels, hoofing 
and mocking them. In crossing the Derwent they fell 
into the water, mistook each other for the sprite, and 
finally reached home separately, each telling a fearful 
tale of having been chased by the Hedley Kow, and 
nearly drowned in the Derwent. 
Surely this Northern sprite is closely akin to Robin 
Goodfellow, whom Ben Jonson introduced to us as 
speaking thus :— 
Sometimes I meete them like a man, 
Sometimes an ox, sometimes a hound, 
And to a horse, I turn me can, 
To trip and trot about them round. 
But if to ride, 
My backe they stride, 
More swift than wind away I go: 
Over edge and lands, - 
Through pools and ponds, 
I whirry laughing, Ho! ho! ho!? 
? The Dunnie, Brag, and Hedley Kow are probably the same as the 
Nick or Nippen. The Irish Phooka takes the shape of a horse, and in- 
duces children to mount him, then plunges with them over a precipice. 
The Scotch Water Kelpie (Sir W. Scott's ‘ Minstrelsy of Scottish Border, 
p. 3) performs the same pranks, (Motherwell’s ‘ Minstreley,’ p. 935

The Kludde of Brabant and Flanders, an evil spirit 
of a Proteus-like character, a good deal resembles the 
Hedley Kow, though, perhaps, he is of a yet more 
alarming and dreadful character. In fact, he inspires 
such fear among the peasants, that they will on no ac- 
count venture into a forest, field, or road which is 
haunted by him. 
Kludde often transforms himself into a tree, small 
and delicate at first, but rapidly shooting into the 
clouds, while everything it shadows is thrown into con- 
fusion. Again he presents himself as a black dog, 
running on its hind-legs, with a chain round its throat ; 
and will spring at the throat of the first person he 
meets, fling him to the ground, and vanish. Occasion- 
ally Kludde will assume the form of a cat, frog, or bat, 
Buchan’s ‘ Ancient Ballads,’ vol. i. p. 214.) The Icelanders have a lay to 
this effect. A damsel (Elen) goes to the waterside, and is carried off on 
the grey Nykkur-horse, which she foolishly mounts. The Nykk claims 
her as his bride, but she escapes by saying she will marry Nobody; and 
as nobody is the Nykk’s name, the spell is broken and she escapes. 
This is a widespread legend. It exists as a ballad in Faroese, as

KLUDDE—OSCHAERT—PADFOOT. 237 
in which disguises he may always be known by two 
little blue flames flattering or dancing before him; but 
most commonly he appears as an old half-starved horse, 
and so presents himself to stable-boys and grooms, who 
mount on it by mistake, instead of on their own horse 
or mare. Kludde sets off at full speed, the frightened 
lad clinging on as best he may, till they reach water, 
into which he rushes and laughs wildly, till his victim, 
sullen and angry, has worked his way to dry land again, 
Oschaert, a sprite which haunted the town of Hamme, 
near Dendermonde, was of much the same character. 
On one occasion it appeared to a young man who went 
out courting—first as an enormous horse, then like a 
huge dog, then as a rabbit springing backward and 
forwards before his path ; and finally like a gigantic ass, 
with fiery eyes as large as plates. It does not appear 
that Oschaert ever received travellers on his back; but 
he used sometimes to leap on theirs, and cling on with 
outspread claws, till the poor victim came either to a 
cross-road or to an image of the Virgin, when his bur- 
den would fall off. On those who were troubled in 
conscience, Oschaert used to press very heavily, striking 
his claws deep into their flesh, and scorching their 
necks with his breath. But all is past now. A good 
priest has exorcised the sprite, and banished him to the 
seashore for ninety-nine years, and there he wanders 
now. 
Then, in Yorkshire, the villages around Leeds have 
a nocturnal terror called the Padfoot. He is described 
as about the size of a small donkey, black, with shaggy 
hair and large eyes like saucers; and it follows people 
by night, or waylays them in the road which they have 
to pass, 
A certain Yorkshire woman, called Old Sally Drans-

field, the carrier from Leeds to Swillington, is a firm 
believer in the Padfoot. She declares that she has 
often seen it—sometimes rolling along the ground before 
her, like a woolpack—sometimes vanishing suddenly 
through a hedge. My friend, the Rev. J. C. Atkinson, 
of Danby, speaks of the Padfoot as a precursor of 
death; as sometimes visible, sometimes invisible, but 
ever and anon padding lightly in the rear of people, 
then again before them or at their side, and uttering 
a roar totally unlike the voice of any known animal. 
Sometimes the trail of a chain would be heard, 
accompanying the light quick pad of the feet.. In size 
it was somewhat larger than a sheep, with long smooth 
hair. It was certainly safer to leave the creature alone, 
for a word or a blow gave it power over you; and a 
story is told of a man, whose way being obstructed. 
again and again by the Padfoot, kicked the thing, 
and was forthwith dragged along through hedge and 
ditch to his home, and left under his own window.! 
These creations of Northern fancy have, together with 
1 A man in Horbury has lately seen ‘the Padfooit” He was going 
home by Jenkin, and he saw a white dog in the hedge. He struck at it, 
and the stick passed through it, Then the white dog looked at him, 
and it had ‘great saucer e’en ;’ and he was so ‘flayed’ that he ran home 
trembling and went to bed, when he fell ill and died. ‘The Padfooit,” 
in this neighbourhood is a white dog like a ‘flay-craw.’ It goes some- 
times on two legs, sometimes it runs on three. To see it is a prognosti- 
cation of death. I have no doubt that ‘the Padfooit is’ akin to the two 
white sows yoked together with a silver chain, which ran down the 
chareh-lane in Lewtrenchard, Devon. It was the custom in ancient 
times to bury a dog or a boar alive under the cornerstone of a’ church, 
that its ghost might haunt the churchyard, and drive off any who 
would profane it—i, ¢., witches or warlocks. 
In Sweden the beast which haunts churchyards is called the Kyrko- 
gtim, It is there said that the first founders of Christian churches used 
to bury a lamb under the altar. Whon anyone enters a church out of 
seryice-time he may chance to see a little lamb spring across the quire,

THE BARGUEST. 239 
some individualisms, a good many attributes in com- 
' mon. I imagine that the Padfoot is the same with the 
Barguest, Babrgeist, or Boguest of Northumberland, 
Durham, and Yorkshire. The proverbial expression, 
*To roar like a Barguest,’ attests to the hold he has had 
on the popular mind. His vocation appears to have 
been that of a presage of death; and bearing this in 
mind, Sir Walter Scott’s derivation of his name from 
the German ‘ bahrgeist,’ spirit of the bier, seems the 
most probable among the many suggested. A friend 
informs me that Glassensikes, near Darlington, is 
haunted by a Barguest, which assumes at will the form 
of a headless man (who disappears in flame), a headless 
lady, a white cat, rabbit, or dog, or a black dog. There 
is a Barguest, too, in a most uncannie-looking glen, 
between Darlington and Houghton, near Throstlenest. 
Remarkable as are the points of resemblance between 
the folk-lore of the North and the West of England, 
the dissimilarity on certain subjects is equally remark~ 
able. How widely do these grotesque and churlish gob- 
lins differ from the light and frolicsome Devonshire pixy! 
The pixy is mischievous too, but graceful and gay in 
his mischief. I have received from Mr. Baring Gould 
a very interesting description of a curious oil-painting 
preserved at. Lewtrenchard House, Devon, representing 
the merrymaking of pixies or elves, which may perhaps 
be inserted here:— 
and vanish. Thatis the church lamb. Its appearance in the grave- 
yard, especially to the gravedigger, is held to betoken the death of a 
child, In Denmark the animal is called the Kirkegrim. 
A grave sow is often seen in the streets. of Kroskjoberg. This is 
said to be the apparition of a sow once buried alive, and to forebode 
death. In building a new bridge at Halle, which was completed in,

secure its stability —S, B. G.

In the background is an elfin city, illumined by the 
moon. Before the gates is a ring of tiny beings dancing 
merrily around what is probably a corpse-candle: it is 
a candle-stump, standing on the ground, and the flame 
diffuses a pallid white light. 
‘In the foreground is water, on which floats a pump— 
kin, with a quarter cut out of it, so as to turn it into a 
poat with a hood. In this the pixy king and his consort 
are enthroned, while round the sides of the boat sit the 
court, dressed in the costume of the period of William of 
Orange, which is the probable date of the painting. On the 
hood sits a little elf, with a red toadstool as an umbrella 
over the head of king and queen. In the bow sits Jack- 
o’-lanthorn, with a cresset in his hands, dressed in a red 
jacket. - Beside him-is an elf playing on a jew’s-harp, 
which is as large as himself; and another mischievous 
red-coated sprite is touching the vibrating tongue of the 
harp with a large extinguisher, so as to stop the music. 
‘The water all round the royal barge is full of little 
old women and red-jacketed hobgoblins, in egg-shells 
and crab-shells; whilst some of the imps, who have been 
making a ladder of an iron boat-chain, have missed 
their footing, and are splashing about in the water. In 
another part of the picture the sprites appear to be illu- 
minating the window of a crumbling tower.’ 
Respecting the Evil Spirit, the veritable Satan, I 
have collected but a few notices, though it must have 
struck my readers that Redcap and Wag-at-the-wa’ were 
suspiciously like him. Border tradition maintains that 
he has been known to assume the form of a black ram 
with fiery eyes and long horns, or of a sow, a bull, a 
goat or horse, a very large dog, or a brindled cat. It is 
impossible for him to take that of the lamb. Of birds he 
can only simulate the crow and the drake. The farmyard

cock and hen, and the pigeon, are too pure for him to 
have anything to do with—the former from their watch- 
fulness, the latter because it has no gall-bladder. It is 
curious to compare this piece of Border folk-lore with 
that of Devonshire, where it is said that the devil can 
assume all shapes except those of the lamb and the dove. 
A little girl, on the borders of Dartmoor, told this to 
one of my relations, adding, ‘He can’t make himself look 
like they, because of Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit.’! 
Mr. G. Henderson’s ‘Popular Rhymes of Berwick- 
shire’ tells us of a remarkable piece of service formerly 
done to the Evil One. ‘ Cloutie’s croft,’ he says, ‘or the 
gudeman’s field, consisted of a small portion of the best 
land, set apart by the inhabitants of most Scottish 
villages as a propitiatory gift to the devil, on which 
property they never ventured to intrude. It was dedi- 
cated to the devil’s service alone, being left untilled 
and uncropped, and it was reckoned highly dangerous 
to break up by tillage such pieces of ground.’? 
A little anecdote has been related to me by the minister 
of , on the Tweedside, which shows that the 
Evil Spirit is held to have power of molesting good: 
Christians in wild, lonely places. A country minister,-’ 
after attending a meeting of his presbytery, had to 
return home alone, and very late, on a dark evening.   
1 A Sussex boy once told me, that if a letter were placed under the 
pillow at night offering to the devil to sell one’s soul, the letter would 
be gone in the morning, and half-a-crown found in its place.—S. B, G. 
2 In several parishes in Devonshire is a patch of land hedged in, 
which is called Gullitrap, and considered uncannie. There is such a piece 
in the parish of Lewtrenchard. The superstition connected. with it is that 
itis a gallow’s trap, for if anyone ‘ feyed’ to be hung enters the field, he 
cannot leave it again, but must wander round and round it, without 
power to find the gato, or climb the fence, till the parson and the magis- 
trate are sent for; the first to take the spell off him, the second to see to 
his being hung—8. B, G.

While riding in a gloomy part of the road, his horse 
stumbled, and the good man was suddenly flung to 
the ground. A loud laugh followed, so scornful and 
so weird, that the minister felt no doubt of the quarter 
whence it proceeded. However, with a stout heart, he 
remounted without delay, and continued his journey, 
erying out, ‘Ay, Satan, ye may laugh ; but when I fall, 
I can get up again; when ye fell, ye never rose ’— 
on which a deep groan was heard. This was firmly be- 
lieved to have been an encounter with the Evil Spirit, 
and a great triumph for the dauntless minister. 
A strange story is told by Scottish firesides, how the 
devil desired to learn one trade after another, but failed 
in all. First, he would be a weaver, but he pricked his 
fingers with the pins of the temples, and threw up 
that occupation. A scrap of an old song speaks of his 
weaving days— 
The weaver de’il gaed out at night 
To see the new, new moon, 
‘Wi’ a’ the traddles at his back, 
An’ the sowin’ bag aboon. 
Next he tried his fortune as a tailor, but first he sewed 
his fingers to the cloth, and then spoiled the sleeve of 
the coat he was making by cutting the curve of the 
elbow wrong; on which his master, out of all patience, 
ran the bodkin into his side, and knocked him over the 
board with the goose. After this he took service with a 
blacksmith, and attempted to shoe a horse, but he only 
pricked the horse, and drove the nails into his own 
finger. As a farrier he maltreated the horse; as a 
tinker he split the caldrons he should have mended ; 
as a carpenter he wounded himself with the chopper, 
bruised bis hands with the plane, fell over the logs of 
wood he should have sawn, and got the toothache from

the noise produced by filing the tools. Lastly, as a 
shoemaker, he took wrong measures, and lost the. rub- 
sticks which were under his care, till his master gave 
him a severe ‘ yocking,’ and disgusted him for ever with 
the awl and the last. Nothing remained to him but to

CHAPTER VIII. 
WORMS OR DRAGONS. 
Probable Origin of these Legends—Worm of Sockburn—The Pollard 
Worm—The Lambton Worm—The Laidley Worm of Spindleston 
Heugh—The Linton Worm—The Dragon of Strathmartin. 
Among the rich and varied folk-lore of the North ox 
England and the Scottish Lowlands, it is impossible not 
to remark how numerous and characteristic are the 
legends respecting dragons or, as we locally call them, 
worms. These tales are sometimes enshrined in ballads, 
sometimes bound up with the tenure of property, some— 
times sculptured as part of church decorations; but all 
live yet upon the lips of the people, though of course 
we cannot presume to guess how long they will main- 
tain their ground against the combined forces of rail- 
roads and collieries. 
Sir Walter Scott, in his ‘Minstrelsy of the Scottish 
Border, accounts for these legends by suggesting that 
in bygone days, before our country was drained and 
cleared of wood, large serpents may have infested 
British woods or moragses, and taxed the prowess 
of British champions. I believe that Mr. Surtees 
held the same opinion, and Lord Lindsay, in his 
‘Sketches of Christian Art,’ writes as follows: ‘The 
dragons of early tradition, whether aquatic or terrestrial, 
are not perhaps wholly to be regarded as fabulous. In 
the case of the former, the race may be supposed to have 
been perpetuated till the marshes or inland seas left by

of the Lernzean hydra, &e. As respects their terrestrial

army of Regulus for three days near the River Bagradus 
in Numidia, will be remembered), their existence, testi- 
fied as it is by the universal credence of antiquity, is not 
absolutely incredible. ‘Lines of descent’ are constantly 
becoming extinct in animal genealogy.’ But be this as 
it may, the creatures still survive in Northern folk-lore, 
and accordingly it is with a peculiar fitness that the 
author of the ‘Dragon of Wantley’ places the den of 
monster ‘in Yorkshire, near fair Rotherham. 
‘Whether the dragon of Wantley was a fair type of the 
Northern worm I can scarcely say : 
This dragon had two furious wings 
Each one upon each shoulder ; 
With a sting in his tayl, as long as a flayl, 
Which made him bolder and bolder. 
He had long claws, and in his jaws, 
Four-and-forty teeth of iron ; 
With a hide as tough, as any buff, 
Which did him round environ. 
Certainly, in some cases, our worms or dragons possess 
four legs, and ¢ the scaly horror of a folded tail; but Mr. 
Surtees, the historian of the Palatinate, vindicates his 
countrymen from all charge of inaccuracy in calling 
such creatures worms, by reminding us that ‘Dante 
calls that venerable quadruped, Cerberus, IL gran vermo 
inferno. 
Let us begin with the Worm of Sockburn, whose story 
is interesting from its extreme antiquity, and its con- 
nection with an old tenure of land. The manor of 
Sockburn was for generations held by the presentation 
of a falchion to the Bishop of Durham on his first
-P-A-G-E-274
  246 WORMS OR DRAGONS. 
entrance into his diocese. This service is said to date 
from the time of Bishop Pudsey, who purchased from 
Richard I., for himself and his successors, the title of 
Earl of Sadberge. And from the time of this ‘jolye Bishop 
of Durham’ (as Hugh Pudsey is called in an old record ) 
to that of Van Mildert, the last of her Palatines, each 
bishop, as he entered his diocese, was met on Croft 
Bridge, or in the middle of the River Tees, by the lord 
of the manor of Sockburn, who, after hailing him Count 
Palatine and Earl of Sadberge, presented him with the 
falchion, and said these words: 
° My Lord Bishop, I here present you with the falchion 
wherewith the champion Conyers slew the worm, dragon, 
or fiery flying serpent, which destroyed man, woman, and. 
child ; in memory of which the king then reigning gave 
him the manor of Sockburn, to hold by this tenure, 
that upon the first entrance of every bishop into the 
county this falchion should be presented.’ 
The Bishop then took the falchion into his hand, and 
immediately returning it, wished the lord of Sockburn 
health and a long enjoyment of the manor. 
There is mention made of this tenure in the inquest 
held on the death of Sir John Conyers, in a.p. 1396. The 
falchion also appears in painted glass in a window of 
Sockburn Church, and together with the worm is sculp- 
tured in marble on the tomb of the ancestor of the 
Conyers family. In April 1826, the steward of Sir 
Edward Blackett, then lord of Sockburn manor, pre- 
sented the falchion on Croft Bridge to Dr. Van Mildert, 
the last Prince-Bishop of Durham. . Whether the 
Palatinate Act provided for the extinction of the service, 
or it lapsed to the Crown, I am not informed. 
Tradition is not very consistent with regard to the 
Pollard Worm. Sometimes she pictures it as a venomous
-P-A-G-E-275
THE POLLARD WORM. 247 
serpent, sometimes as a wild boar or brawn; but with- 
out doubt its local habitation was Bishop’s Auckland, 
the bishop’s land of oaks, and there it was slain by the 
champion knight Pollard, of Pollard Hall, who received 
as his guerdon as much land as he could ride round while 
the Bishop dined. This estate, called Pollard’s Dene, 
in the parish of Bishop’s Auckland, was held by a tenure 
similar to that of the lordship of Sockburn, and the 
presentation speech ran as follows: 
* My Lord, I, in behalf of myself, as well as several 
others, possessors of the Pollard’s lands, do humbly pre- 
sent your lordship with this falchion at your first coming 
here, wherewith, as the tradition goeth, he slew of old 
a venomous serpent, which did much harm to man and 
beast; and by performing this service we hold our 
jands.’ : 
It may be added that the family of Pollard is a very 
ancient one, and its crest, an arm holding a falchion. 
Of the Lambton Worm far more is known. Partly 
from the romantic character of its history, partly because 
it relates to a family of note in the county, it seems to 
have taken deep hold of the popular mind in Durham, 
and it is also fortunate in a chronicler. About thirty 
years ago, Sir Cuthbert Sharpe, the friend of Mr. Sur- 
tees, and his assistant in the History of the Palatinate, 
collected every particular respecting this worm from old 
residents in the neighbourhood of Lambton, and 
placed the whole in the ‘Bishoprick Garland,’ a collection 
of legends, songs, ballads, &c., relating to the county of 
Durham. As only one hundred and fifty copies of this 
little work were printed, and it is now extremely scarce, 
free use has been made of it in the following account of 
the Worm of Lambton :— 
The park and manor-house of Lambton, belonging
-P-A-G-E-276
248 WORMS OR DRAGONS. 
to a family of the same name, lig on the banks of the 
Wear, to the north of Lumley. The family is a very an- 
cient one, much oldet, it is believed, than the twelfth 
century, to which date its pedigree extends. The old 
castle was dismantled in 1797, when the present mansion 
was built on the north bank of the swiftly-flowing Wear, 
in a situation of exceeding beauty. The park also con- 
tains the ruins of a chapel, called Brugeford or Bridge- 
ford, close to one of the bridges which span the Wear. 
Long, long ago, some say about the fourteenth cen- 
tury, the young heir of Lambton led a careless, profane 
life, regardless alike of his duties to God and man, and 
in particular neglecting to attend mass, that he might 
spend his Sunday mornings in fishing. One Sunday, 
while thus engaged, having cast his line into the Wear 
many times without success, he vented his disappoint- 
ment in curses loud and deep, to the great scandal of 
the servants and tenantry as they passed by to the chapel 
at Brugeford. 
Soon afterwards, he felt something tugging at his 
line, and trusting he had at last secured a fine fish, he 
exerted all his skill and strength to bring his prey to 
Jand. But what were his horror and dismay on finding 
that, instead of a fish, he had only caught a worm of 
most unsightly appearance! He hastily tore the thing 
from his hook, and flung it into a well close by, which 
is still known by the name of the Worm Well. 
The young heir had scarcely thrown his line again 
into the stream, when a stranger of venerable appear- 
ance, passing by, asked him what sport he had met with. 
To which he replied, ‘ Why, truly, I think I have caught 
the devil himself. Look in and judge.” The stranger 
looked, and remarked that he bad never seen the like 
of it before; that it resembled an eft, only it had nine
-P-A-G-E-277
THE LAMBTON WORM. 249 . 
holes on each side of its mouth; and, finally, that he 
thought it boded no good. 
Meanwhile the worm remained in the well till it 
outgrew so confined a dwelling-place. It then emerged, 
and betook itself by day to the river, where it lay coiled 
round a rock in the middle of the stream, and by night 
to a neighbouring hill, round whose base it would 
twine itself; while it continued to grow so fast, that it 
soon could encircle the hill three times. This eminence 
is still called the Worm Hill. It is oval in shape, on 
the north side of the Wear, and about a mile and a half 
from Lambton Hall. 
The monster now became the terror of the whole 
country side. It sucked the cows’ milk, worried the 
cattle, devoured the lambs, and committed every sort of 
depredation on the helpless peasantry. Having laid waste 
the district on the north side of the river, it crossed the 
stream and approached Lambton Hall, where the old 
lord was living alone and desolate. His son had repented 
of his evil life, and had gone to the wars in a distant 
country. Some authorities tell us he had embarked as 
a crusader for the Holy Land. 
On hearing of their enemy’s approach, the terrified 
household assembled in council. Much was said, but 
to little purpose, till the steward, a man of age and 
experience, advised that the large trough which stood 
in the courtyard should immediately be filled with milk. 
This was done without delay ; the monster approached, 
drank the milk, and, without doing further harm, re- 
turned across the Wear to wrap his giant form around 
his favourite hill. The next day he was seen recross- 
ing the river; the trough was hastily filled again, and 
with the same results. It was found that the milk of 
‘nine kye’ was needed to fill the trough; and if this
-P-A-G-E-278
  250 WORMS OR DRAGONS. 
quantity was not placed there every day, regularly and. 
in full measure, the worm would break out into a violent 
rage, lashing its tail round the trees in the park, and 
tearing them up by the roots. 
The Lambton Worm was now, in fact, the terror of the 
North Country. It had not been left altogether unop- 
posed. Many a gallant knight had come out to fight 
with the monster, but all to no purpose; for it possessed 
the marvellous power of reuniting itself after being cut 
asunder, and thus was more than a match for the chivalry 
of the North. So, after many conflicts, and much loss 
of life and limb, the creature was left in possession of 
its favourite hill. 
After seven long years, however, the heir of Lambton. 
returned home, a sadder and a wiser man: returned to 
find the broad lands of his ancestors waste and desolate, 
his people oppressed and wellnigh exterminated, his 
father sinking into the grave overwhelmed with care 
and anxiety. He took no rest, we are told,.till he had 
crossed the river and surveyed the worm as it lay coiled 
round the foot of the hill; then, hearing how its former 
opponents had failed, he took counsel in the matter from 
a sybil or wise woman. 
At first the sybil did nothing but upbraid him for 
having brought this scourge upon his house and neigh- 
bourhood; but when she perceived that he was indeed 
penitent, and desirous at any cost to remove the evil he 
had caused, she gave him her advice and instructions. 
He was to get his best suit of mail studded thickly with 
spear-heads, to put it on, and thus armed to take his 
stand on the rock in the middle of the river, there to 
meet his enemy, trusting the issue to Providence and his 
good sword. But she charged him before going to the 
encounter to take a vow, that, if successful, he would
-P-A-G-E-279
THE LAMBTON WORM. 251 
slay the first living thing that met him on his way 
homewards, Should he fail to fulfil this vow, she 
warned him that for nine generations no lord of Lamb- 
ton would die in his bed. 
The heir, now a belted knight, made the vow in 
Brugeford Chapel; he studded his armour with the 
sharpest spear-heads, and unsheathing his trusty sword, 
took his stand on the rock in the middle of the Wear. 
At the accustomed hour the worm uncoiled its ‘snaky 
twine,’ and wound its way towards the hall, crossing the 
river close by the rock on which the knight was stand- 
ing, eager for the combat. He struck a violent blow 
upon the monster’s head as it passed, on which the 
creature, ‘irritated and vexed,’ though apparently not 
injured, flung its tail round him, as if to strangle him 
in its coils, 
Now was seen the value of the sybil’s advice. The 
closer the worm wrapped him in its folds, the more 
deadly were its self-inflicted wounds, till at last the river 
ran crimson with its gore. Its strength thus diminish- 
ing, the knight was able at last with his good sword to 
cut the serpent in two; the severed part was imme- 
diately borne away by the swiftness of the current, 
and the worm, unable to reunite itself, was utterly 
destroyed. 
During this long and desperate conflict, the household 
of Lambton had shut themselves within-doors to pray 
for their young lord, he having promised that when 
it was over, he would, if conqueror, blow a blast 
on his bugle. This would assure his father of his 
safety, and warn them to let louse the favourite hound, 
which they had destined as the sacrifice on the occasion, 
according to the sybil’s requirements and the young 
lord’s vow. When, however, the bugle-notes were heard
-P-A-G-E-280
252 WORMS OR DRAGONS. 
within the hall, the old man forgot everything but his 
son’s safety, and rushing out of doors, ran to meet the 
hero and embrace him. 
The heir of Lambton was thunderstruck ; what could 
he do? It was impossible to lift his hand against his 
father; yet how else to fulfil his vow? In his per- 
plexity he blew another blast; the hound was let loose, 
it bounded to its master; the sword, yet reeking with 
the monster’s gore, was plunged into its heart ; but all 
in vain. The vow was broken, the sybil’s prediction 
fulfilled, and the curse lay upon the house of Lambton 
for nine generations. 
The exact. date of the story is of course uncertain. 
Sir Cuthbert Sharpe appends to it the following entry 
from an old manuscript pedigree, lately in the possession 
of the family of Middleton, of Offerton :—‘ John Lamb- 
ton, that slewe ye worme, was knight of Rhodes and 
lord of Lambton, after ye dethe of fower brothers— 
“sans eschew malle.”’ Now nine ascending genera- 
tions, from a certain Henry Lambton, Esq., M.P., would 
exactly reach to Sir John Lambton, knight of Rhodes; 
and it was to that Henry Lambton that the old people 
of the neighbourhood used to look with great anxiety, 
marvelling whether the curse would ‘hold good to the 
end.’ He died in his carriage, crossing the new bridge 
at Lambton, on the 26th of June, 1761; and popular 
tradition is clear and unanimous in maintaining that, 
during the period of the curse, no lord of Lambton 
ever died in his bed. The violent deaths of some among 
them are recorded in history. Sir William Lambton, a 
colonel of a regiment of foot, in the service of Charles I., 
was slain at Marston Moor; and his son William, as 
gallant a Royalist as his father, received his death-wound 
at Wakefield, at the head of a troop of dragoons,
-P-A-G-E-281
THE WORM OF SPINDLESTON HEUGH. 253 
A.D. 1643. Surely such deaths as these show how a 
curse may pass into a blessing! 
It may be added that two stone figures of some 
antiquity and: tolerable workmanship existed lately 
- at Lambton Castle. One of these was apparently an 
effigy of our hero—studded armour, sword, and van- 
guished monster, all as described in the legend, except 
that the worm is endowed with ears, legs, and even a 
pair of wings. The other figure was a female one, and 
marked by no very characteristic features. It might, 
however, have been meant for the sybil. The trough 
from which the worm took its daily tribute of milk is 
still to be seen at Lambton Hall; and Mr. Surtees 
mentions that, in his young days, he saw there a piece 
of some tough substance, resembling bull’s hide, which 
was shown him as part of the worm’s skin. 
From the green banks of the Wear we must pass to the 
_ stern and rock-bound coast of Northumberland, if we 
would make acquaintance with the Laidley (4. loathly, 
or loathsome) Worm of Spindleston Heugh. Its history 
is exceedingly popular on the Borders, as Sir Walter 
Scott remarks in his ‘ Minstrelsy of the Scottish Bor- 
der,’ though he refrains from transeribing it on account 
of its resemblance to ‘Kempion.’ The legend was put 
into verse-—very unequal, however, in character—by a 
former vicar of Norham. 
It opens with a parting between a king and his 
daughter. He goes out to win a second bride, and 
leaves his child, the Lady Margaret, in charge of Bam- 
borough Castle. We see her, during her father’s 
absence, arranging everything against his return, trip- 
ping out and tripping in, with the keys hanging over 
her left shoulder. At last the day arrives; the chief- 
tains of the Border are all assembled to receive the king
-P-A-G-E-282
    254 WORMS OR DRAGONS. 
and queen. They come; the Lady Margaret welcomes 
them to hall and bower, and then, turning sweetly to 
her stepmother, reminds her that everything now is hers. 
One of the chieftains, struck by the young girl’s beauty 
and simplicity, praises her loudly in the queen’s hear- 
ing, as 
Excelling all of woman kind 
In beauty and in worth. 
The jealous queen mutters, ‘You might have excepted 
me;’ and from that hour Margaret’s fate was sealed. 
The next morning the maiden was standing at her bower- 
door, laughing for joy of heart; but before nightfall 
her stepdame had witched her to a loathsome worm, so 
to abide till her brother, the Childe of Wynde, should 
come to her rescue from beyond seas. The cave is still 
shown at Spindleston Heugh where the worm hid itself 
by day; during the night it would wander on the coast. 
We do not hear of any depredations it committed, 
beyond the exaction of a tribute of milk (that favourite 
beverage of Northern worms !); but so poisonous was the 
creature, that for seven long miles in every direction the 
country was laid waste ; no green thing would grow. 
At last, word-went over the sea, to the Childe of Wynde, 
that his native land was desolated by a Laidley Worm 
on Spindleston Heugh ; and, fearing lest any harm should 
befall his sister, he summoned his merry men, thirty- 
and-three in number: 
They built a ship without delay, 
With masts oF the rowan-tree, 
With fluttering sails of silk so fine, 
And set her on the sea. 
They went on board, the wind with speed 
Blew them along the deep ; 
At length they spied a huge square tower 
On a rock so high and steep.
-P-A-G-E-283
THE WORM OF SPINDLESTON HEUGH. 255 
The sailors recognised the Northumbrian coast and 
King Ida’s Castle, and made towards shore. 
Meanwhile, the queen looked out of her bower- 
window, and spying the gallant ship with its silken sails, 
sent out her evil companions, the“ witch wives,’ to sink 
it in the waters; but they returned baffled and sullen, 
murmuring that there must be rowan-wood about the 
ship, for all their spells were powerless. Next she dis- 
patched a boat with armed men to withstand the landing 
of the vessel ; but the gallant Childe speedily put them 
to the rout. Lastly, it would seem that the worm itself 
withstood its deliverer, for we are told that 
The worme lept up, the worme lept down, 
She plaited round the stone, 
And aye, as the ship came close to Jand, 
She banged it off again. 
However, the Childe of Wynde steered the ship out 
of her reach, ran ashore on the sands of Budle, a 
small village near Bamborough, and, drawing his sword, 
went boldly towards the monster, as if to do battle at 
once. But the creature submitted, exclaiming,— 
*O quit thy sword, and bend thy bow, 
And give me kisses three ; 
For though I be a poisonous worme, 
No hurt I'll do to thee. 
O quit thy sword, and bend thy bow, 
And give me kisses three ; 
If I’m not won ere set of sun, 
‘Won shall I never be.’ 
He quitted his sword, and bent his bow, 
He gave hor kisses three ; 
She crept into her hole @ worme, 
But out stept a ladye.
-P-A-G-E-284
256 , WORMS OR DRAGONS. 
Our hero folded his recovered sister in his mantle, 
and bore her with him to Bamborough Castle, where he 
found his father inconsolable for her loss, though, 
through the queen’s witcheries, he had tamely submitted. 
to it. However, the queen’s power was over now, and. 
the Childe pronounced her unalterable doom. Changed 
into a toad, she was to wander till doomsday round 
Bamborough Castle, and the fair maidens of that neigh- 
bourhood believe that she still vents her malice against 
them by spitting venom at them. 
Crossing the Border into Roxburghshire, we approach 
the haunts of the Worme of Linton, and very romantic 
they are. There is the mountain stream of the Kail, 
bursting in brightness from the Cheviot Hills, and 
hurrying into the plain below, where it pauses, ere 
it wends its way to join the Tweed; there is the 
low irregular mound, marking where stood the Tower 
of Linton, the stronghold of the Somervilles; there is 
the old village church, standing on its remarkable knoll 
of sand; there are the stately woods of Clifton, and, 
above all, the lofty heights of Cheviot crowning the 
distance. 
Such is the fair scene which tradition avers was once 
laid waste by a fierce and voracious monster. His den, 
still named the ‘ Worm’s Hole,’ lay in a hollow to the 
east of the Hill of Linton; and small need had he to 
leave it, for from this retreat he could with his sweep- 
ing and venomous breath draw the neighbouring flocks 
and herds within reach of his fangs. Still he did occa~ 
sionally emerge and coil himself round an eminence of 
some height, at no great distance, still bearing the name 
of Wormington or Wormistonne. Liberal guerdons were 
offered to any champion who would rid the country of 
_ such a scourge, but in vain—such was the dread inspired
-P-A-G-E-285
THE LINTON WORM. - O57 
by the monster’s poisonous breath. Not only were the 
neighbouring villagers beside themselves with terror, 
but the inhabitants of Jedburgh, full ten miles off, were 
struck with such a panic, that they were ready to desert 
their town. . 
At last, however, the Laird of Lariston, a man of 
reckless bravery, came forward to the rescue of this dis- 
tressed district; and, as the Linton cottagers testify to 
this day, having once failed in an attack with ordinary 
weapons, he resorted to the expedient of thrusting down 
its throat a peat dipped in scalding pitch and fixed on 
his lance, The device proved perfectly successful. The 
aromatic quality of the burning pitch, while it suffocated 
and choked the monster, preserved the champion from | 
the effects of its poison-laden breath. While dying, 
the worm is said to have contracted its folds with such 
violent muscular energy, that the sides of Wormington 
Hill are still marked with their spiral impressions. In 
requital of his service, the Laird of Lariston received 
the gift of extensive lands in the neighbourhood. 
The Somerville family (for nearly four hundred years 
Lords of Linton) claim the merit of this exploit for the 
John Somerville who received the Barony of Lynton in 
1174, and built its tower. They maintain that it was 
conferred on him by William the Lion as a reward for 
slaying the worm, and they bear a dragon for their crest 
in memorial of it, Unfortunately, however, in their 
hands the worm loses much of its grandeur and impor- 
tance. The monster encircling the hillock with its 
snaky coils, becomes ‘in length three Scots’ yards, and 
somewhat bigger than an ordinary man’s leg, with a 
head more proportionable to its length than greatness, | 
in form and colour like to our common muir-edders.’ 
In this disparaging way at least is the Linton Worm‘ 
§
-P-A-G-E-286
  258 WORMS OR DRAGONS. 
described by the author of ‘ The Memoirs of the Somer— 
villes,’ a.v. 1680. 
The sculptured effigy of the monster, which may still 
be seen with the champion who slew it, at the south— 
western extremity of Linton Church, differs from both 
accounts. A stone, evidently of great antiquity, is there 
built into the wall. It is covered with sculpture in low 
relief, and bears figures which, though defaced by time, 
can yet be made out pretty clearly. A knight on horse- 
back, clad in a tunic or hauberk, with a round helmet, 
urges his horse against two large animals, the foreparts 
of which only are visible, and plunges his lance into the 
throat of one. Behind him is the outline of another 
creature, apparently of a lamb. The heads of the mon- 
sters are strong and powerful, but more like those of 
quadrupeds than of serpents. It is perplexing also to 
see two of them, but not the less does popular tradition 
connect the representation with the Linton Worm, and 
aver that the inscription below it, now quite defaced, 
ran thus: 
The wode Laird of Larristone 
Slew the Worme of Wormestone, 
And wan a’ Linton parochine, 
It should be added, that though the present church 
appears to have been rebuilt at no very distant date, it 
stands on the site of the former one, and is formed from 
its materials; this sculptured stone having stood, it is 
said, above the door of the old church. Whether it 
really represents some doughty deed by which the first, 
Somerville won the favour of William the Lion, or 
visibly embodies the great conflict between Christianity 
and Paganism, has been much disputed by antiquarians. 
The figure, resembling a lamb behind. the vietorious 
knight, is certainly suggestive of a mythical interpreta-
-P-A-G-E-287
LEGEND OF LINTON CHURCH. 259 
tion, and reminds us of the banner of St. Erie, so trea- 
sured by the ancient Swedes, and stored in the cathedral 
at Upsala, which bore on one side, in gold embroidery, a 
Jamb and a dragon, 
There is another legend connected with Linton, of 
exceeding interest. It is sometimes interwoven with 
that of the Worm, and, though I am informed that in its 
more correct form it stands alone, I may perhaps be 
pardoned for a little discursiveness if I pause to relate 
it. The church is built on a little knoll of fine compact 
sand, without any admixture of stone, or even pebbles, 
and widely differing from the soil of the neighbouring 
heights. The sand has nowhere hardened into stone, 
yet the particles are so coherent, that the sides of newly~ 
opened graves appear smooth as a wall, and this to the 
depth of fifteen feet. This singular phenomenon is thus 
accounted for on the spot: 
Many ages ago a young man killed a priest in this 
place, and was condemned to suffer death for murder 
and sacrilege. His doom seemed inevitable, but power- 
ful intercession was made for him, especially by his two 
sisters, who were fondly attached to their brother. At 
last his ‘life was granted him, on condition that the 
sisters should sift as much sand as would form a mound 
on which to build a church. The maidens joyfully under- 
took the task, and their patience did not fail. They 
completed it, and the church was built, though it is 
added that one of the sisters died immediately after her 
brother’s liberation, either from the effects of past 
fatigue or overpowering joy. Such is the version of the 
legend, deemed the correct one at Linton. The vil- 
lagers point to the sandy knoll in confirmation of its 
truth, and show a hollow place a short distance to the 
westward as that from which the sand was taken.

  260 WORMS OR DRAGONS. 
Whether dragon-stories extend further into Scotlan: 
I cannot say, further than that one is current at Strath 
martin, in Forfar. There stands in that village a large 
stone, called Martin’s Stone; and it is said to commemo— 
tate the victory of a champion named Martin over a 
dragon which had devoured nine maidens successively, 
as they went out one after another on a Sunday evening 
to fetch water for their father from the spring. Cer- 
tainly these tales appear circumscribed within a narrow 
district. I cannot hear of anything analogous to them: 
in the South of England, and the dragon-stories of 
Sweden and Norway are of a somewhat different 
character. There we find these monsters inhabiting 
dens and holes in the earth, where they brood over the 
treasures they have collected from the bottom of the 
sea. Such a monster dwells under the foundations of 
Ayers Church, gloating over his stores of precious things. 
Others have issued forth occasionally from Dragon’s 
Hole on Storoe in Aadal, from the Dragon’s Hill on 
Rasvog, and other places; but we hear nothing of 
champions combating with them. There is a tradition, 
however, that a priest named Anders Madsen, who lived 
about the year 1631, shot the dragon which brooded 
over a hoard of silver in the so-called Dragon Mount 
near the Tvedevaud.! 
From our point of view, in the nineteenth century, 
it is perhaps impossible to discover what local cireum- 
stances fixed the idea of dragon-foe and conquering 
champion so strongly in the popular mind of one 
especial district. It is, of course, one which meets us 
again and again in almost every form of belief which 
has prevailed in the world. Classic mythology tells us 
of Cadmus and the Dragon, Apollo and Python, Her-

cules and the Hydra, with many more. Brahminism 
hands down from its earliest days the wonderful picture 
of Krishna suffering and Krishna triumphant—a two- 
fold representation, wherein the hero is first bound in 
the serpent’s coils, and wounded by it in the heel, and 
then stands forth its conqueror with his foot set upon 
its head. And the mythology of our own Teuton fore- 
fathers shows us the heroic Sigurd and the fiery dragon 
Fafner. Surely, in these and a thousand more such 
instances, the ceaseless universal strife between good 
and evil, once shown to human eyes in its intensity 
upon Mount Calvary, is faintly shadowed forth with 
more or less of truth and clearness!

CHAPTER IX. 
OCCULT POWERS AND SYMPATHIES, 
Seventh Sons or ‘ Marcoux ’—Twins—Aérial Appearances—The School- 
boy and Neville’s Cross—Sympathy between Bees and their Owners 
—The Old Woman and Spider. 
Amone occult powers exercised, or thought to be exer- 
cised, by certain members of the ‘human race, none have 
been more widely credited than those supposed to re- 
side in seventh sons. The seventh of a family of sons, 
no daughters intervening, has the reputation of healing 
scrofula and other kindred complaints with the touch. 
This belief has been universal in Great Britain as well 
as in France, and it still crops out here and there. In 
the village of Ideford, in South Devon, lived (perhaps 
still lives) a respectable farmer, who claimed to heal asa 
seventh son, and patients resorted to him from Exeter, 
Torquay, and other places at some little distance. The 
French name for such a person is a ‘marcou,’ and the 
Orléannais is the district where the belief in their powers 
is the strongest. ‘Ifa man is the seventh son of his 
father, no female intervening, he is a marcou; he has 
on some part of his body the mark of a fleur-de-lis, and, 
like the}King of France, he has the power of curing the 
king’s-evil. All that is necessary to effect a cure is, 
that the marcow should breathe upon the part affected, 
or that the sufferer should touch the mark of the fleur- 
de-lis.’ Of all the marcous of the Orléannais, he of Ormes 
 
-P-A-G-E-291
SEVENTH SONS. 263 
is the best known and most celebrated. Every year, 
from twenty, thirty, forty leagues around, crowds of 
patients come to visit him. ..... The marcow of 
Ormes is a cooper in easy circumstances, being the pos- 
sessor of a horse and carriage. His name isFoulon, and in 
this country he is known by the appellation of ¢ Le beaw 
marcou.’ He has the fleur-de-lis on his left side.’ On 
the Borders the sign of the seven stars marks the seventh 
son to be a channel of healing. If seventh sons thus 
marked are brought up as doctors, they are in great 
requisition; in any case, people resort to them to be 
touched for the king’s-evil. The belief in their powers 
holds its ground firmly in the Western Highlands. 
There the seventh son lays his hand on the party affected, 
commonly, but not always, uttering an invocation to the 
Trinity. In the island of Lewes he gives the patient a 
sixpenny-piece with a hole in it, through which a string 
is passed to wear round the neck. Should this be taken 
off, a return of the malady may be looked for. Dr. 
Mitchell adds, that when seven sons are born in suc- 
cession, the parents consider themselves bound, if 
possible, to bring up the seventh for adoctor. Seventh 
sons are also seers, and have the privilege, if such it be, 
of second-sight. Their healing powers are, on the Bor- 
ders, shared with twins and children born with cauls; 
but, in all these cases, the virtue is held to be so much 
subtracted from their own vital energy, and, if much 
drawn upon, they pine away and die of exhaustion. As to 
twins, a strong sympathy is believed to exist between 
them, so that what gives pain or pleasure to the one, is 
suffered or enjoyed by the other as well, Should one 
die however, the other, though weakly before, will at

once improve in health and strength, the life and vital 
.energy of his fellow being added to his own. 
This curious belief recalls to the memory how, in 
Spenser’s ‘Faerie Queene,’ Agapé, the mother of three 
brave knights, 
Borne of one mother in one happie mold, 
Borne at one burden in one happie morne, 
visits the three Fates, that she may learn the length of 
her sons’ lives; and finding the thread of their existence 
‘So thin as spiders’ frame, . 
And eke so short that seemed their ends out shortly came,’ 
finding also that no prayer of hers could avail to 
lengthen their allotted span, she asked: and obtained 
the following request : : 
‘ Then since,’ quoth she, the ‘ terme of each man’s life, 
For nought may lessened nor enlarged be ; 
Grant this: that when ye shred with fatall knife 
His life, which is the eldest of the three, 
Which is of them the shortest, as I see, 
Eft soones his life may pass into the next ; 
And when the next shall likewise ended bee, 
That both their lives may likewise be annext 
Unto the third, that his may so be trebly wext.’! 
There is a strong tendency in the ‘North Countrie’ 
to connect the past and the present external nature, 
and the history and destiny of man. Thus the aurora 
borealis is still well known there as ‘the Derwentwater 
Lights,’ in consequence of having been particularly red 
and vivid at the time of that unfortunate nobleman’s 
execution. The death of Louis XVI. was foreshadowed, 
too, by the aurora borealis; and myriads of fighting 
men were seen in the sky night after night, all through 
1 Book iv. Canto 2.

LEGEND AT NEVILLE’S CROSS. 265 
the county of Durham, before the French Revolution. © 
The Rev. Henry Humble informs me that he has heard’ 
people declare that they had distinctly heard the cries of 
the combatants and groans of the wounded. Again, Iam 
told that, a little before the rising of either 1715 or 1745, 
there were seen appearances in the sky as of encountering 
armies; which were, however, subsequently explained by 
a refraction in the atmosphere, causing something like 
the Fata Morgana. A few Jacobite gentlemen raised 
certain troops of horse, and exercised them on some of 
the high ground in Lancashire, and these being seen re- 
flected in the clouds, formed the apparition. Still, with- 
out doubt, wars have been ushered in by such aérial 
appearances. Armies were seen contending in the clouds 
before the destruction of Jerusalem, as well as before 
the Battle of Ivry, and the persecutions of the Walden- 
ses in the seventeenth century. 
But further: our great battles leave an abiding im 
press on the imagination and heart of the Northern, 
Witness the following incident, which occurred to my 
fellow-worker herself. She was teaching in a Sunday- 
school in the city of Durham, and the chapter (from the 
First Book of Samuel) having being duly read in class, 
one of the pupils observed that he did not like that 
chapter as well as last Sunday’s, because there were no 
battles in it. On this the teacher thought fit to dilate 
on the blessings of peace and the horrors of war; to all 
which, like a truculent young Northern as he was, the 
boy turned a deaf ear, only observing that there had 
been a great battle close to Durham once. ‘ And where 
was it fought?’ asked she. ‘At Neville’s Cross,’ an- 
swered the lad, promptly. ‘I go there very often of an 
evening to see the place; and if you walk nine times 
round the Cross, and then stoop down and lay your head
-P-A-G-E-294
266 OCCULT POWERS AND SYMPATHIES. 
, to the turf, you'll hear the noise of the battle and the 
clash of the armour.’ These were the young fellow’s 
exact words. The walking round the Cross I believe to 
be purely local; but the sites of other great battles of 
the world are in like manner haunted by echoes of the 
fight; and the Northamptonshire peasants on Naseby 
field, and the Greek shepherd on the plains of Marathon, 
alike listen for them with thrilling heart. 
I may, perhaps, allude here to the sympathy supposed. 
to exist between bees and their owners, a belief in which 
seems to have extended over every part of our island. 
It is said here and there that bees will not thrive in a 
quarrelsome family; that if a swarm alight on a dead 
tree there will be a death in the owner’s house within a 
year; that stolen bees never thrive; and, above all, that 
on the death of the master, or indeed of any member of 
his family, the bees will desert their hives, unless some 
one takes the house-key, raps with it three times on the 
‘board that supports the hives, informs the bees what has 
taken place, and fastens a bit of black crape to the hive. 
In ‘ Choice Notes—Foux-Lors,”! we read of this belief in 
Lincolnshire, Oxford, Surrey, and Sussex, as well as in 
other parts of England. I know it is in full force in 
Devonshire, and a Yorkshiré lady writes thus: ‘When 
I came to F , in 1847, everything was much as it 
had been when my husband’s mother was living. She 
had not then been dead a year. Inthe garden I noticed 
a row of bee skeps, to which were attached one or two 
pieces of black crape. The hives were empty. On inquiry, 
one of the servants said, “Ah! the bees are all flown, 
ma’am ; they are offended because none of the family 
went to tell them of the mistress’s death. I suppose the   
1 Pages 208-214, 
 
-P-A-G-E-295
THE OLD WOMAN AND SPIDER. 267 
young ladies did not think of such things, and though I 
put the bits of mourning on them, they all went away.”’ 
Precisely the same belief holds in North Germany, 
where they also maintain, that when the master of the 
house dies, some one must go into the garden and shake 
the trees, saying, ‘The master is dead,—the master is 
dead,’ else they will all decay. 
One or two instances, in which popular belief glorifies 
the world around us with light borrowed from the days 
when Our Saviour walked on earth, have been given 
already. One of exceeding beauty has recently come be- 
fore me. In the little town of Malton, in Yorkshire, about 
nine years ago, my friend the Rev. J. B. Dykes, now vicar 
of St. Oswald’s, Durham, while visiting an old woman 
during her last illness, observed a spider near her bed, 
and attempted to destroy it. She at once interfered, 
and told him with much earnestness that spiders ought 
not to be killed; for we should remember how, when 
our Blessed Lord lay in the manger at Bethlehem, the 
spider came and spun a beautiful web, which protected 
the innocent Babe from all the dangers which surrounded 
Him. The old woman was about ninety years of age. 
I have never met with the legend elsewhere.

TuE universal voice of mankind has ever pointed out 
certain places as the borderland between the material 
and the spiritual world—has, truly or falsely, indicated. 
deserted houses, marshy wastes, lonely roads, spots where 
enormous crimes have been perpetrated, and so forth, as 
haunted. In general, places which once were closely 
connected with man, but are now deserted by him, are 
thus distinguished in the popular mind, rather than 
those which have always been barren and desolate. It 
is natural, then, that with a past rich in historic inci- 
dents of the wildest kind, we have many haunted spots 
in the North. Mr. J. M. Tweddell writes to me, re- 
specting Cleveland, that every old castle and ruined. 
monastery there has its legend of a subterranean pas~ 
sage leading therefrom, which some one has penetrated. 
to a certain distance, and has seen an iron chest, sup- 
posed to be full of gold, on which was perched a raven. 
This raven points out, he considers, the Scandinavian 
origin of the legend. Lexhoe, near Stokesley, was 
haunted. The history of the place is thus re¢orded by 
the same hand :— 
 
-P-A-G-E-297
THE FARMER AND OLD NANNIE. 269 
An old woman of Lexhoe appeared after her death to 
a farmer of the place, and informed him that, beneath a 
certain tree in his apple orchard, he would find a hoard 
of gold and silver which she had buried there. He was 
to take a spade and dig it up, keep the silver for his 
trouble, but give the gold to a niece of hers who was then 
living in great poverty, and whose place of abode she 
pointed out. At daybreak, after his dream or vision, 
the farmer went to the spot indicated, dug, and found 
the treasure, but kept it all to himself, though the sum 
allotted to him was considerable, and might have satis- 
fied him. From that day, however, he never knew rest 
or happiness. Though a sober man before, he took to 
drinking, ‘but all in vain—his conscience gave him no 
rest. Every night, at home or abroad, old Nanny’s 
ghost failed not to dog his steps, and reproach him with 
his faithlessness. At last, one Saturday evening, the 
neighbours heard him returning from Stokesley Market 
very late; his horse was galloping furiously, and as he 
left the high road to go into the lane which led to bis own 
house, he never stopped to open the gate at the entrance 
of the lane, but cleared it with a bound. As he passeda 
neighbour's house, its inmates heard him screaming out, 
‘I will—I will—I will!’ and looking out, they saw a little 
old woman in black, with a large straw hat on her head, 
whom they recognised as old Nannie, seated behind the 
terrified man on the runaway nag, and clinging to him 
closely. The farmer’s hat was off, his hair stood on end, 
as he fled past them, uttering his fearful ery, ‘I will—I 
will—I will!’ But when the horse reached the farm all 
was still, for the rider was a corpse ! 
Mines have ever been supposed to be haunted; nor can 
we wonder at it, considering the many unearthly sounds | 
constantly to be heard there—‘the dripping of water

down the shafis, the tunnelling of distant passages, the 
rumbling of trains from some freshly~explored lode,’ and. 
all received upon the ear in gloom and often in solitude. 
The following instance, told by a miner on his sick-bed 
to his clergyman, is recorded in ‘ Communications with 
the Unseen World’ (page 121): ‘The overseer of the 
mine he had been used to work in (at Whitehaven) for 
many years, was a Cumberland man; but being found 
guilty of some unfair proceedings, he was dismissed 
by the proprietors from his post, though employed in 
an inferior situation. The new overseer was a Northum- 
berland man, who had the burr that distinguishes that 
county very strongly. To this person the degraded 
overseer bore the strongest hatred, and was heard to say 
that some day he would be his ruin. He lived, how- 
ever, in apparent friendship with him; but one day they 
were both destroyed together by the firedamp. It was 
believed in the mine that, preferring revenge to life, the 
ex-overseer had taken his successor, less acquainted than 
himself with the localities of the mine, into a place where 
he knew the firedamp to exist, and that without a 
safety-lamp; and had thus contrived bis destruction. 
But ever after that time, in the place where the two 
men perished, their voices might be heard high in dis~ 
pute, the Northumbrian burr being distinctly audible, 
and so also the well-known pronunciation of the trea~ 
cherous murderer.’ Compare with this incident the fol~ 
lowing communication from the Rev. 8. Baring-Gould : 
‘I know a man who is haunted by two spectres. He 
has shaking fits, during which his eyes wander about the 
room ; then he sees the ghosts. He was a miner, and 
is said to have half-cut through the rope when some 
men against whom he bore a grudge were going down 
the pit; the rope broke, and they were dashed to pieces,

THE LADY OF LITTLEDEAN. 271 
Their ghosts haunt him night and day, and he can never 
remain long in one house, or endure to be alone night 
or day.’ 
Mr. Wilkie relates a story somewhat similar to that 
given above from Cleveland, but with a happier termi- 
nation. It runs as follows: ‘The old tower of Little- 
dean, on the Tweed side, had long been haunted by the 
spirit of an old lady, once its mistress, who had been a 
covetous, grasping woman, and oppressive to the poor. 
Tradition averred that she had amassed a large sum of 
money by thrift or extortion, and now could not rest in 
her grave because of it. Spite of its ghost, however, 
Littledean Tower was inhabited by a laird and his family, 
who found no fault with their place of abode, and were 
not much troubled by thoughts of the supernatural 
world, One Saturday evening, however, a servant-girl, 
who was cleaning shoes in the kitchen by herself, sud- 
denly observed an elf-light shining on the floor. While’ 
she gazed on it, it disappeared, and in its place stood an 
old woman wrapped in a brown cloak, who muttered 
something about being cold, and asked to warm herself 
at the fire. The girl readily consented, and seeing that 
her visitor’s shoes were wet, and her toes peeping out 
blue and cold from their tips, she good-naturedly offered 
to dry and clean the shoes, and did so. The old lady, 
touched by this attention, confessed herself frankly to 
be the apparition that haunted the house. ‘My gold 
wud na let me rest,” said she, “but I'll tell ye where it 
lies ; "tis ‘neath the lowest step o’ the Tower stairs. Take 
the laird there, an’ tell him what I now tell ye; then 
dig up the treasure, and put it in his hands, An’ tell him 
to part it in two shares: one share let him keep, for 
he’s master here now; the other share he maun part 
again, and gie half to you, for ye are a kind Jassie and

a true, and half he maun gie to the poor o’ Maxton, the 
auld folk and the fatherless bairns, and them that need. 
it most Do this an’ I sall rest in my grave, where I’ve 
no rested yet, and never will I trouble the house mair 
till the day 0’ doom.” The girl rubbed her eyes, looked 
again, and behold the old woman was gone! 
«Next morning the young servant took her master to 
the spot which had been indicated to her, and told him 
what had taken place. The stone was removed, and 
the treasure discovered, and divided according to the in- 
structions given. The laird, being blessed with a goodly 
family of sturdy lads and smiling maidens, found no 
difficulty in disposing of his share. The servant-girl, so 
richly dowered, found a good husband ere the year had 
passed. The poor of Maxton, for the first time in their 
lives, blessed the old lady of Littledean ; and never was 
the ancient tower troubled again by ghost or apparition.’ 
The same locality supplies us with another legend. 
About half-a-mile to the east of Maxton, a small rivulet 
runs across the turnpike road, at a spot called Bow- 
brig-syke. Near this bridge lies a triangular field, in 
which, for nearly a century, it was averred that the 
forms of two ladies, dressed in white, might be seen 
pacing up and down. Night after night the people 
of the neighbourhood used to come and watch them, 
and curiosity brought many from a great distance. The 
figures were always to be seen at dusk; they walked 
arm-in-arm over precisely the same spot of ground till 
morning light. Mr. Wilkie adds that, about twelve years 
before the time of his noting down the story, while some 
workmen were repairing the road, they took up the large 
flat stones upon which foot-passengers crossed the burn, 
and found beneath them the skeletons of two women 
lying side by side. After this discovery, the Bow-brig
-P-A-G-E-301
DURHAM GHOST STORIES, © 273 
ladies were never again seen to walk in the Three-corner- 
field. 
Mr. Wilkie says further, that he received this account 
from a gentleman who saw and examined the skeletons, 
and who added that they were believed to be those of 
two ladies, sisters to a former Laird of Littledean. Their 
brother is said to have killed them in a fit of passion, 
because they interfered to protect from illusage a young 
lady whom he had met at Bow-brig-syke. He placed 
their bodies upon the bridge, and lowered the flat stones 
upon them to prevent discovery. Some years later he 
met with his own death near the same fatal spot. While 
riding with his dogs he fell over the brae opposite to 
the bridge, and was found lying dead by the Tweed 
side. Tradition identifies him with the Laird Harry 
Gilles, whose adventure in hunting has already been 
related. 
I believe that there is firm faith in ghosts, and their 
power of revisiting the earth, throughout the entire 
county of Durham; and it is thought that a Romish 
priest is the proper person to lay them. The great 
season for their appearance is St. Thomas's eve and day, 
and they haunt the earth till Christmas eve, when the 
approaching festival, of course, puts them to fight. It 
was on one of these unlucky days, which happened also 
to be a Friday, that one of the waits disappeared at the 
foot of Elvet Bridge, Durham, not to be seen again ; 
since which event the waits have never played in that 
city on Friday nights. On St. Thomas’s eve and day, too, 
have carriers and waggoriers been most alarmed by the 
ghost of the murdered woman, who was wont to haunt 
the path or lane between the Cradle Well and Neville’s 
Cross. With her child dangling at her side, she used 
to join parties coming in or going out of Durham in
-P-A-G-E-302
  274 HAUNTED SPOTS. 
carriers’ carts or waggons, would enter the vehicles and 
there seat herself; hut always disappeared when they 
reached the limits of her hopeless pilgrimage. 
Night after night, too, when it is sufficiently dark, 
the Headless Coach whirls along the rough approach to 
_ Langley Hall, near Durham, drawn by black and fiery 
steeds. We hear of this apparition, too, in Northum— 
berland. ‘When the death-hearse, drawn by headless 
horses, and driven by a headless driver, is seen about mid— 
night, proceeding rapidly, but without noise, towards the 
cburehyard, the death of some considerable person in the 
parish is sure to happen at no distant period.’! And it is 
recorded in Rees’ Diary, that the death of one John Bor- 
row, of Durham, was presaged by a vision of a coach 
drawn by six black swine, and driven by a black driver. 
And for Yorkshire, the Rev..J. Barmby assures me 
that there were plenty of ghosts or bogles about the vil- 
lage of Melsonby, a district with which he used to be 
well acquainted. A well there, called the Lady Well, 
was haunted by a lady without a head, and Berry Well 
by a. bogle in the form of a white goose. Not far off 
was a conical hill, called Diddersley Hill, on Gatherley 
Moor, where an old farmer declares the fairies used to 
dance in his young days, And near this hill an arch 
spanned the road, not of any great antiquity, certainly ; 
still a mounted horseman was to be seen there in the 
early morning light, to the great terror of the farmers’ 
lads who had to pass. beneath, starting before dawn with 
carts for coals into ‘Bishoprig,’ ¢.e. the county of Durham. 
_ The village of Calverley, near Bradford, in. Yorkshire, 
has been haunted since the time of Queen Elizabeth by 
the apparition of Master Walter Calverley, now popu- 
larly called Sir Walter. It is averred that this man 
1 Rambles in Northumberland.
-P-A-G-E-303

murdered his wife and children, and, refusing to plead, 
was subjected to the ‘peine forte ef dure.’ In his last 
agony he is said to have exclaimed, ‘Them that. love 
Sir Walter, loup on, loup on!’ which accordingly be- 
came the watchword of the apparition, which frequented 
a lane near the village of Calverley. There is no fear, 
however, of meeting it at present; the ghost has been 
laid, and cannot reappear as long as green holly grows 
on the manor. My friend the Rev. J. Barmby, how- 
ever, informs me that his grandfather, when a child, 
and riding behind his father on horseback, saw the ap- 
parition, and was terrified by it; while the father, to 
allay his boy’s fears, said, ‘It’s only Sir Walter.’ This 
Master Walter Calverley is the hero of ‘The Yorkshire 
Tragedy,’ one of the plays attributed by some to Shake- 
speare. 
Of haunted houses we have one at Wellington Dene, 
another at North Shields, and a third at Chester-le-street. 
Crook Hall, near Durham, has its ghost, called the White 
Lady, and South Biddick Hall its ideal tenant, one Ma- 
dame Lambton. The Rev. Henry Humble informs me 
that a house at Perth, let in tenements, was considered 
haunted on account of the strange and unaccountable 
sounds heard there. Sometimes music was heard, pro- 
ceeding apparently from a fixed spot in the wall. It was 
always heard in the same place and at the same time, i.e 
between seven and eight in the evening and one and two 
in the early morning, but sometimes for a longer, some~ 
times for a shorter, period of time. Again, there were 
unaccountable rappings and knockings by unknown 
hands. The only thing alleged in explanation was, that 
a former proprietor and inhabitant of the house was a 
very wicked man. 
From the Rev. J. F. Bigge I learn a few particulars 
T2
-P-A-G-E-304
    276 HAUNTED SPOTS. 
respecting another haunted house—Dalton Hill Head, 
once belonging to the family of Hedley, of Newcastle, 
but purchased from them by Mr. Collingwood, of Dis— 
sington. Some years ago a woman, named Mary 
Henderson (a connexion, it appears, of George Stephen — 
son the engineer), had sole charge of the house; but 
the gardener lived closed by, and kept a mastiff, called. 
‘Ball.’ Against the advice of the gardener, she pried into 
a hidden closet, and discovered in it a quantity of chil— 
dren’s bones, some in hat-boxes, some wrapped in articles 
of clothing. She begged for the dog as a companion 
through the night, closed the house, and went to bed, but. 
was soon awoke by strange sounds of dancing and singing: 
upstairs. Being a bold woman, she got up to investigate 
into the matter, but the dog was terrified, and unwilling 
to accompany her. She took him in her arms, and went 
round the house. All was still and empty, but an attic 
window stood open. We are not informed whether the 
disturbances continued after this investigation. 
One of my clerical friends, an incumbent in York 
shire, has been good enough to communicate to me 
a family legend of an apparition witnessed by one of 
his aunts, and often told by her. This lady used, when 
a girl, to visit at the house of a gentleman near Ripon, 
and on one oceasion, when about thirteen or fourteen 
years old, was spending the afternoon there. She was 
playing in the garden with his children, young people 
of about ber own age, when one of them exclaimed, 
_ *Why, there is brother. walking at the bottom of 
the garden,’ She looked up, and recognised the form 
and features of the young man, who was then in India. 
His figure appeared with perfect distinctness upon a 
gravel path which Jed round the garden, but not to any 
other place. One of the children, a young girl, ran into  
-P-A-G-E-305

the house and told her father what they had seen. He 
bade her run away and go on playing—it must be a 
mistake. However, he took out his watch, noted the 
time, and wrote down the day and hour. When the 
next Indian mail arrived, it brought intelligence of his 
son’s death, at the very time when the children had 
seen his ‘ eidolon’ in the garden. 
Through the kindness of the Rev. S. Baring-Gould, 
I am enabled to conclude my series of apparitions and 
haunted houses with the account of one which though 
from another part of England,is of such exceeding interest 
that I am much gratified with the permission to record, 
it in these pages as I received it from his pen :— : 
‘Lewtrenchard House is haunted by a White Lady, 
who goes by the name of Madame Gould, and is sup- 
posed to be the spirit of a lady who died there—like 
Queen Elizabeth, seated in her chair—in the middle of 
the last century. Her maiden name was Belfield, and 
she married William Drake Gould, son of Henry Gould 
and Elizabeth, only child of a Drake of Littleham. 
‘ Before the late alterations in Lew House, there was 
a corridor extending the whole length of the upper story 
of the house; along this the lady was supposed to walk 
at night, and her step was frequently heard. 
‘My mother has often told me how she has heard the 
step at night, as though proceeding from high-heeled 
shoes, walking slowly up the corridor, and thinking it 
might be my father coming to bed, she has opened the 
door to admit him; but on looking out, she has seen the 
moon streaming in through the windows on an empty. 
passage, down which she stil] heard the measured tread. 
My sister often expressed her desire to hear the steps of 
the spectral lady, but was still disappointed, though she 
sat up on purpose.
-P-A-G-E-306

* One summer night, however, she was sitting in her 
room, with window and door open, writing a letter, and 
thinking of anything but the old Madame, when she 
heard steps along the corridor. At the moment she 
thought it might be my father, and she rose, took up 
her candle, and went to the door to speak tohim. To 
her surprise she saw no one, but the steps passed her, 
and went on into the lumber-room at the end of the 
passage. Being a resolute and courageous young lady, 
she followed the sound into the room, but could see no 
one. She also opened the only other door beyond her 
own, and which gave admittance to one of the servants’ 
rooms, to, ascertain whether the noise could have pro- 
ceeded thence, but she found the two maids fast asleep. 
* At the end of the house is a long oak-tree avenue 3 
the White Lady is said to have been seen pacing up 
and down this, gleaming in and out among the gnarled 
tree-trunks, as she passed into the moonlight or dis- 
appeared in the shade. 
" ‘About three miles off is a quaint old granite mansion, 
half pulled down by my grandfather, and turned into a - 
substantial farmhouse. The old hall, now converted 
into a granary, and reduced half its original height, 
contains still a seven-light window, and three granite 
fireplaces. This ancient house belonged originally to 
the Woods, and there was a standing feud between that 
family and my own, till they were ruined, and Madame 
Gould bought the land and house from them; after 
which she declared she should die happy. 
© On the confines of this property, called Orchard, is a 
deep gloomy valley, through which trickles a rill of 
dark water, under the shadow of the thick fir planta~ 
tions which clothe the sides of the glen, It goes by the 
name of the Black Valley, and the Bratton-Clovelly road
-P-A-G-E-307

plunges down into it, crosses a little bridge, and scrambles: 
up the opposite side through the gloom of the odver- 
hanging trees. On the side of the road is an old mine- 
shaft, long abandoned. It is confidently asserted by 
Lew and Bratton people that, on dark nights, Madame 
Gould is to be seen, dressed all in white, standing by 
the side of the stream, with a phosphorescent light 
strearning from her face and her clothes; and that she 
stoops and takes up handfuls of water, which she allows 
to trickle down in sparkling drops through her fingers. 
Sometimes she combs her long brown floating hair with 
a silver comb; and many a Bratton man, returning 
from market, has seen her and been nearly frightened - 
out of his wits. Not many years ago,a man of that 
village had his leg broken by falling over a hedge, in 
his attempt to escape from the apparition, as it issued 
from the old mining-shaft and made towards him. 
‘A young man, named Symmonds, living at Holdstrong, 
a farm in the parish, left home for America during the 
old Madame’s lifetime. After some years he returned, 
and hiring a horse at Tavistock, he rode home, a dis- 
tance of twelve miles. It was a clear moonlight night, 
and as he passed through the Lew Valley, with the white 
yime lying thick on the grass, he noticed a newly- 
ploughed field, in which the plough had been left. On 
this was seated a lady in white satin, with long brown 
hair floating down her shoulders. Her face was up- 
lifted, and her eyes directed towards the moon, so that 
Mr. Symmonds had a full view of it. He recognised her 
at once, and taking off his hat, he called out, “I wish 
you a very good night, Madame.” She bowed in return, 
and waved her hand, the man noticing the sparkle of her 
diamond rings as she did so. On reaching home, after 
the first greetings and congratulations, he said to his

aged parents, “What do you think now? I haveseen that 
. strange Madame Gould sitting on a plough, this time ©” 
night, and with frost on the ground, looking at the 
moon.” All who heard him started, and a blank ex— 
pression passed over their countenances. The young™ 
man, seeing that he had surprised them more than 
he anticipated, asked what was the matte. The 
reply was, “‘ Madame was buried three days ago in Lew 
Church.” ” 
It must be noticed that a belief connected with the 
appearance of spirits, up to the third day after death or 
burial, is very ancient. S. Macarius the Younger, of 
Alexandria (a.p. 373), thus speaks: ‘On the third day, 
the oblation having been made in the church, the alle~ 
viation of its pain, which it underwent through separa— 
tion from the body, the departed soul... . . receives 
good hope. For two days it was permitted to the soul 
to wander about on the earth at its wil. Wherefore 
the soul, enthralled with love to its body, sometimes 
haunts the mansion wherein it had dwelt, sometimes 
the sepulchre in which its body is laid, and thus for 
two days it seeks, as it were, its part, in seeking its 
corpse.’ © 
But to return to the subject under consideration. 
‘An old woman once entered the orchard near Lew 
Church, and seeing the trees laden with apples, she 
shook some down and filled her pockets, keeping one in 
her hand to eat. She then turned to the gate into the 
road, but suddenly there flashed before her in the way 
the figure of the old Madame in white, pointing to the 
apple. The poor woman in an agony of terror cast it 
away, and fled across the orchard to a gap in the hedge on the opposite side; but at the moment she reached it, 
the figure of the White Lady appeared standing in the
-P-A-G-E-309
THE WHITE LADY OF LEWIRENCHARD. 281 
gap, looking at her sternly, and pointing to ber pocket. 
It was not till the old goody had emptied it of the stolen 
apples that the spectre vanished. 
‘Old Lewtrenchard Church was handsomely furnished 
with a carved oak screen and bench-ends. Six of these 
ends alone remain. They are of excellent workmanship: 
one representing St. Michael weighing souls, one a lady’s 
portrait in a medallion, with a jester in cap and bells 
in a niche beneath it, another a gentleman’s portrait 
with an old battlemented gateway beneath it. The 
other bench-ends bear shields with the emblems of the 
Passion upon them. My grandfather, with intent to 
‘beautify’ the church, removed all the benches, cut 
down the screen and burnt it for firewood, and filled 
the church with neat deal pews of various shapes and 
Sizes. 
“*The carpenter who was employed to effect these 
changes, before leaving his work one evening, out of 
curiosity, opened the vault in which lay William Drake 
Gould and his lady. Finding the lady’s coffin-lid loose, 
he proceeded to raise it, that he might take a look at 
the redoubted Madame. Immediately she opened her 
eyes, sat up, and rose to her feet. The carpenter, who 
was an elderly man, frightened out of bis senses, rushed 
from the church, which was filled with light from the 
body of the risen lady. As the man dashed down the 
churchyard avenue he turned his head back, and saw 
her over his shoulder gleaming in the porch, and pre- 
paring to sail down the path after him. 
‘From the church to his house was a good mile and a 
quarter, and the road passes nearly all the way through 
woods. He ran as he never ran before, and as he ran 
his shadow went before him, cast by the light which 
shone from the spectral Jady who followed him. On
-P-A-G-E-310
  282 : HAUNTED SPOTS. 
reaching his house he burst the door open, and dashed 
into bed beside his wife, who was infirm and bedridden. 
Both then saw the figure standing in the doorway, and. 
the light from it was so intense that, to use the old 
woman’s words, she could see by it a pin lying on the 
floor. 
‘There is a stone shown on the “ramps” of Lew Slate 
Quarry, where seven parsons met to lay the old Madame. 
Opinions differ as to what took place—whether she was 
laid in part or not at all. Some say that the white ow], 
which nightly flits to and fro in front of Lew House, is 
the spirit of the lady conjured by the parsons into a 
bird; others doubt this; but I believe all agree that 
the parsons failed because one of the number was “a bit 
fresh ” when he came, and had forgotten the right words 
to be used. 
‘I have not the smallest doubt in my own mind that 
this history is in its essentials of very great antiquity ; 
that the apparition is really an ancient white lady, who 
has suffered anthropomorphosis, and become Madame 
Gould; the same stories and the same superstitions 
having been rife ages before the birth of the lady to 
whom they have now been applied. . 
‘In many pvints Madame Gould strongly resembles 
the German Dame Holle: such as her connexion with 
water and her silver comb, as well as the appearance 
to the apple-picker. Holle or Holdar, in Germany, is a 
very beautiful white lady with long flowing hair of a 
golden hue; she haunts fountains and streams, and is 
often engaged in washing. She is well disposed, and 
rebukes bad children, punishing theft and other faults. 
Her dress is white with a golden girdle, and she ig 
radiant with light. She is an ancient Teutonic goddess. Curiously enough, also, she lives in mountains, and

issues luminous from the mouth of caves, just as Ma- 
dame Gould appeared to the man from the old mine- 
shaft. In one account of the apparition which I obtained, 
Madame Gould was expressly said to have appeared 
with golden hair; whereas her portrait represents her 
as avery beautiful woman, with long brown hair floating 
down her back. 
‘I have given these stories of the old Madame with 
some fulness, because I believe her to be unquestion- 
ably an ancient Saxon goddess, who has fallen from her 
pedestal, and undergone anthropomorphosis and Socali- 
zation; and such instances, though not uncommon in 
Norway or Germany, are rare in England.’ 
Devonshire is no doubt a land of ghost stories. I 
remember how racily some of them were told by an 
old clergyman of that county with whose family my 
own is connected. One was of a young lady in North 
Devon, whose father had been carried off by smugglers, 
kept a prisoner for a ‘year and a day,’ and only released 
on payment of a large sum of money. He did not long 
survive his restoration to his home, and his daughter, 
an only child and motherless, soon followed him to the 
grave, worn out by that year of loneliness and suspense. 
But she did not rest there; her spirit haunted the 
neighbouring. town, a straggling fishing-place, whose 
inhabitants were supposed to be implicated in the ab- 
duction of her father. Her mode of punishing them 
was peculiar. She would flit from house to house on 
Sunday morning, while the dinners were cooking, and, 
laying her cold hand on the meat, would taint it, so that 
it became absolutely uneatable. Another story was re- 
lated, to account for the peculiar shape of the dining~ 
room in a certain Dartmoor vicarage, and was to this 
effect :—
-P-A-G-E-312
284 HAUNTED SPOTS. 
Some years back a clergyman, on taking possession. 
of a living on the confines of Dartmoor, found it neces— 
sary to enlarge the house, which was really little better 
than the peasants’ cottages around it. He lengthened the 
one sitting-room, and made it into a tolerable dining- 
room, and added a drawing-room and two or three 
bedrooms. These improvements satisfied his wife and 
children ; but there was one interested party whom he had. 
left out of consideration—the spirit of his predecessor, 
an old gentleman who had outlived all his family, 
and passed many solitary years in the remote par— 
sonage. 
And soon the consequences of this neglect appeared. 
Sounds were soon heard of an evening, as though a figure 
ina dressing-gown were sweeping in and out of the rooms, 
and treading with a soft yet heavy tread, and this par- 
ticularly,in the dining-room, where the old vicar had. 
spent the last years of his life, sitting over the fire, or 
pacing up and down in his dressing-gown and slippers. 
The eerie sounds began at nightfall and continued at 
intervals till morning. Uneasiness pervaded the house- 
hold. Servants gave warning and went away ; no one ap- 
plied for their vacant places. The daughters fell ill, and 
were sent away for change of air; then their mother 
was anxious about them, and went to see how they were 
going on; and so the Vicar was left alone, at the mercy 
of his predecessor’s ghost. At first he bore up bravely, 
but one Saturday night, while he was sitting up late, 
and ‘wearily going over his Sunday sermons, the ‘ pad, 
pad ’ of the measured tread struck so painfully upon his 
nerves, that he could bear it no longer. He started up, 
opened the window, jumped out, and made the best of 
his way to the nearest farm, where lived his church- 
warden, an honest Dartmoor farmer.
-P-A-G-E-313
THE DARTMOOR VICARAGE. 285 
There the Vicar found a kind welcome; and when he 
told his tale, in a hesitating sort of way, owning his dis- 
like to solitude, and apologising for the weakness of nerves 
which made him fancy he heard the sounds so often de- 
scribed to him, his host broke in with a declaration of 
his belief that the old Vicar was at the bottom of it, just 
because of the alterations in the house he had lived in 
so many years. ‘ He never could abide changes,’ pur- 
sued the farmer, ‘but he’s had his day, and you should 
have yours now. He must be laid, that’s certain; and 
if you'll go away next week, and see your missis and the 
young ladies, I'll see to it.’ 
And see to it he did. A jury of seven parsons was 
convoked, and each sat for half-an-hour with a candle in © 
his hand, and it burned out its time with each, showing 
plainly that none of them could lay the ghost. Nor was 
this any wonder, for were they not all old acquaintances 
of his, so that he knew all their tricks? The spirit could 
afford to defy them ; it was not worth his while to blow 
their candles out. But the'seventh parson was a stran~ 
ger, and a scholar fresh from Oxford. In his hand the 
light went out at once. He was clearly the man to lay 
the ghost, and he did not shrink from his task; he laid 
it at once, and in a beer-barrel. 
But now a fresh difficulty arose. What was to be 
done with the beer-barrel and its mysterious tenant? 
Where could it be placed secure from the touch of any 
curjous hand, which might be tempted to broach the 
barrel, and set free the ghost? Nothing occurred to the 
assembled company but to roll the beer-barrel into one 
corner, and send for the mason to enclose it with stones 
and mortar. This done, the room looked very odd with 
one comer cut off. Uniformity would be attained if 
the other three corners were filled up as well; and besides,
-P-A-G-E-314
286 . HAUNTED SPOTS. 
the ghost would be safer if no one knew the very corner 
in which he was reposing. So the other corners were 
blocked ‘up, and with success. What matters it if the 
room be smaller !—the parsonage has never been haunted 
since.

DREAMS. 287 
CHAPTER XI. 
DREAMS. 
Dreams presaging Death—Dead Bodies Discovered through Dreams— 
Visions—-The Bodach Glas—Second-sight. 
Or dreams which convey an intimation either of 
what is actually taking place at a great distance, or of 
future events, many instances have been recorded, and 
many are treasured in the memory of different families 
through this as well as other countries. Where such 
dreams and their fulfilment are well accredited we can- 
not disbelieve them; nor do I know why we should be 
desirous to do so, since we know from Scripture that 
dreams have been used as the vehicle of intercourse be- 
tween the visible and the invisible worlds. Some dreams 
worthy of note are scattered through these pages; a few 
others, chiefly warnings of death, remain to be recorded. 
The first was related’ to me by a clerical friend, who 
knew the persons concerned in it and heard it from them. 
Three brothers, whom we will call Charles, James, and 
Edward, lived in different parts of one of the northern 
counties of England. Edward, on awaking one morning, 
was surprised to find his wife still in bed; and asked why 
she was not getting up as usual. | She said that she was 
quite unnerved by a terrible dream, and must wait a little 
to recover herself. At first he laughed at her fears, but 
seeing that she was really in distress, inquired what the 
dream had been. His wife told him that she had seer
-P-A-G-E-316
288 DREAMS, * 
him with his two brothers, Charles and James, standin & 
in earnest conversation on a grass-plot. Meanwhile, a 
young man then dead, but formerly in the employment 
of Edward, came towards them with a paper inhishand, 
rauch crossed and blotted over. The ground suddenly 
opened, James fell into the chasm and disappeared. 
«You and Charles,’ said the poor wife, ‘would press to 
the margin of the dangerous pit to see what had become 
of him, and I was endeavouring to keep you back.” 
While she was uttering these words the soundofahorse 
galloping into the courtyard roused her husband. He 
went to the window, threw it up, and asked what was the 
matter. The reply was ‘Come over directly to - 
Your brother, Mr. James B——, is just dead” It ap— 
peared afterwards that Mr. James B had been iz 
his usual health till about three o’clock that morning, 
when he was seized with violent internal pains and died 
in a few minutes, 
The wife, who related this to my informant, dwelt a 
good deal on the appearance in her dream of the young 
man lately in her husband’s employ, saying he had once 
before appeared to her in a dream which had been duly 
fulfilled. During an absence of her husband, she had 
- been much alarmed by a report that the vessel by which 
he had sailed for London was lost, but she had been re— 
assured by a dream in which this young man had told 
her he was safe and would write to her within three 
days, which came to pass accordingly. 
A very touching dream, also a portent of death, hag 
been thus reported to me on credible authority. It ig 
said to have occurred some years ago in the family of an, 
Irish Bishop. A little boy came downstairs one morn— 
ing, saying, ‘Oh, mamma, I have had such anice dream : 
somebody gave me such a pretty box, and I am sure it   
 
-P-A-G-E-317
DREAM OF THE REY. J. DUCHE. 289 
was for me, for there was my name on it. Look, it was 
just like this,’ and taking up a slate and pencil the child 
drew the shape of a coffin. The parents gazed at one 
another in alarm, not lessened by the gambols of the 
child, who frolicked about in high health and spirits. 
The father was obliged to go out that morning, but be 
begged the mother to keep the child in hersight through 
the day. She did so, till on dressing to go out in her 
carriage, the little boy slipped away to the stables, where - 
he begged the coachman to take him by his side while 
he drove to the house-door, a thing he had often done 
before. On this occasion, however, the horses were res- 
tive, the driver lost control over them, and the child was 
flung off and killed on the spot. 
- Another dream, which has always appeared to me very 
remarkable, I give in the words of the late Rev. Daw- 
son Warren, vicar of Edmonton, a clergyman with whose 
family I am closely connected. He recorded it on the 
authority of his mother, a lady of considerable sense and 
talents, who had seen the documents upon which its 
truth was substantiated, and who fully believed it. The 
dreamer, the Rev. Jacob Duché, a chaplain in America 
at the time of the Revolutionary War, was compelled to 
take refuge in England, but returned to his home and 
family on the re-establishment of peace. When Mr. 
Duché was returning to America to rejoin his family, 
and was about halfway across the Atlantic, he dreamed 
one night that he had landed, arrived in Philadelphia, 
and was hastening to his home. His honse-door 
appeared to be open; he thought that he ran into 
his study, and that he found sitting in his own chair his 
wife, wringing her hands and lamenting the death of 
their favourite son. She seemed to tell him the painful 
uU
-P-A-G-E-318

particulars, and then his grief awakened him. I: 
his dream to his fellow-passengers and to the « 
the ship, and was so deeply impressed by the 
stance, that he wrote out a full account of it, 
attested by their signatures. On his arrival 
delphia, he hastened to his house; he found 
open, he flew to his study, he found his wife : 
his chair, and in an agony of grief she told h 
death of their beloved son, which had taken place 2 0..~ 
very time of the dream. 
A remarkable discovery of a dead body b 
took place in our own country in the year 181 
narrated in the papers of the day. Mr. Smith 
to Sir Clifford Constable, was supposed to havi 
to the Tees, his hat and stick having been four | 
waterside, and the river was dragged for. sow. 
without success. A person named Awde, fi | 
Newsham, a small village four miles from Wy 
dreamt that poor Smith was lying under the 
certain rock about 300 yards below Whorlt: 
and that his right arm was broken. The 
affected this man, that he got up early and set ov+ ~* - 
to search the river. He went to the boat-house 
story to the person in charge there, and aske 
boat. He rowed to the spot he had seen in hi 
and on the first trial he made with the boat-] 
drew up the body of the drowned man, and found the 
right arm actually broken. 
The Rev. Henry Humble parallels this history with 
one from Cornwall which came to his own knowledge. 
A lady of Truro dreamed the night before a boating- 
party that the boat was upset, and she herself drowned. 
She therefore determined not to join it, and sent an 
excuse. The partyreturned safely, however, and the lady,
-P-A-G-E-319
VISIONS. 291 
after telling a friend what had passed, and describing - 
where she had dreamt that the body would be found, 
ceased to think of the matter. A month or two later 
the lady had occasion to cross the Truro river at King 
Harry’s Passage—the boat was upset—she was drowned, 
and they sought for the body in vain. Then the friend 
to whom she had told her dream came forward and 
pointed out the spot marked out in that dream as the 
body’s resting-place, and there it was found. — 
Of visions or waking-dreams, two very interesting ones 
have been communicated to me by the gentleman to 
whom these pages are so largely indebted, the Rev. 8. 
Baring-Gould. I give them in his own words :—‘ An old 
woman, Widow Freeman, lived at Horbury some years 
ago, and is there buried. She was a most devout and 
. earnest churchwoman, a frequent communicant, and re- 
gular at daily matins. She often had visions, one of 
which was as follows: The old woman was sitting in 
her cottage, reading her Bible or Prayer Book, when a 
sudden blaze of light filled the room, and on looking up 
the whole chamber was illumined with dazzling white 
glory. Numerous white doves were flitting about, 
flashing in the light, winnowing the air with their wings, 
and encircling the widow. She observed that their 
beaks (nibbs she called them) were steeped in blood, and 
they dropped the blood upon her. In another moment 
they vanished, but the light became painfully dazzling, 
and in the midst of it stood Our Lord displaying His five 
wounds. She was left in a state of overwhelming joy, 
and could not restrain herself from relating what she had 
seen to some of her neighbours and to the parish priest ; 
but she had a strong aversion to relating it to anyone who 
did not believe in the supernatural, lest, as she termed 
v2
-P-A-G-E-320
292 DREAMS. 
it, she should be “giving that which is holy unto dogs, 
and casting pearls before swine.” 
* Another Horbury woman, of a different character 
from Widow Freeman, and by no means 80 attentive to 
her religious duties, had a vision whilst engaged in her 
work this month (November, 1865). She saw suddenly 
before her amonstrous and very terrible beast “summat 
like a padfoit,” and she was “right fleyed to see’t; ”? it 
had great goggle e’en and a mouth ravening for blood. 
It seemed about to rush upon her and rend her in pieces, 
when a hand appeared marked with blood, and this 
hand smote the beast, and it fled with a bellow that 
shook the house.’ 
The following dream recorded by the same hand is 
very remarkable: ‘A man at » in Lincolnshire, 
known for his drunken and disorderly life, had a dream, 
He thought that he was driving down a winding Jane on 
‘a dark ‘night. He heard footsteps behind him and 
turned to look, but could only discern a dark figure ap- 
proaching, without being able to see the face. The 
stranger came up with the cart, and the driver saw that 
he was dressed in a long dark cloak. Suddenly the 
foot-traveller threw open the cloak, and asked to be re- 
ceived into the cart, and by the wounds in His hands 
the poor man recognised “his dear Saviour.” Before 
he answered the man awoke. For some time he lived 
a better life, but gradually relapsed, and before the 
year was out had become worse than ever. Then he 
dreamt again. He was driving down the same dark 
lane, but no footsteps sounded behind him. He looked 
round. At that moment the cart was upset, he fell 
into a ditch full of fire, and awoke with a scream, waft- 
ing the flames from his mouth. A few nights after the 
wretched man left a publichouse drunk in his cart, and  
-P-A-G-E-321
DEATH-OMENS. 293 
was found next morning lying under his upset cart with 
his neck broken.’ 
The belief in death-omens peculiar to certain families 
is purely Celtic, and does not, therefore, fall within the 
province of Border folk-lore. Mr. Wilkie indeed men- 
tions the Maug or May Moulach, but. calls it a spirit 
akin to the Killmoulis, whereas it is the girl with the 
hairy left-hand which haunts Tulloch Gorms, and gives 
warning of a death in the Grant family, like the Banshee 
in many old houses in Ireland, the Bodca~an-Dun in the 
family of Rothmurchas, or the spectre of the bloody 
hand in that of Kinchardines. Such a prophet of death 
was the Bodach Glas, or dark grey man, of which Sir 
Walter Scott makes such effective use in Waverley to- 
wards the end of Fergus Mac Ivor’s history. Its appear- 
ance foretold death in the clan of , and I have 
been informed on the most credible testimony of its 
appearance in our own day. The Earl of E——~, a 
nobleman alike beloved and respected in Scotland, and 
whose death was truly felt as a national loss, was play- 
ing on the day of his decease on the links of St. An- 
drews at the national game of golf. Suddenly he 
stopped in the middle of a game, saying, ‘I can play no 
longer, there is the Bodach Glas. I have seen it for 
the third time; something fearful is going to befall 
me. He died that night at M.-M » as he was 
banding a candlestick to a lady who was retiring to her 
room. The clergyman from whom I receive this story 
endorses it as authentic, and names the gentleman to 
whom Lord E spoke. 
I learn from another friend that, this was not the first 
presage of impending doom vouchsafed to this noble- 
man. A warning of his wife’s death was also granted 
him, and in this manner. Shortly after her confinement,   
  
 
-P-A-G-E-322

which she had passed through safely, he went from 
home to attend a wedding, and during his absence 
dreamt that he read in The Times newspaper an an-— 
nouncement of Lady E ’s death on a day not far 
distant. The dream affected him a good deal, and his 
dejection the next day was apparent to every one. He 
returned home, found the countess doing well, but soon 
after she caught cold from being moved into 4a damp 
room; illness came on, and her husband was roused up 
one night with tidings of her being in a dangerous 
state. It was the morning indicated by the dream. 
The earl remembered it, and rose up (as he afterwards 
expressed it) with a yell of agony. Before nightfall she 
had expired. 
Second-sight, again, belongs properly to the High- 
lands, and accordingly lies beyond the limits I have laid. 
down for myself in this work. Mr. Wilkie says little 
respecting it, except that the seventh son of seventh 
sons are persons marked out to be the possessors of the 
mysterious gift. He calls the seer an Elleree, a name I 
have never met elsewhere, and says that if he sees 
sparks of fire falling on a person, that person’s death is 
near at hand. But the more common presage of death 
is for the Elleree to see the man wrapped in his shroud, 
and, according as the shroud covers more or less of the 
figure, will the death be near or remote. Again, should. 
the Elleree see a funeral, and distinguish the persons of 
any of the attendants, those men are marked for an 
early grave. 
It is to be regretted that this subject of second-sight 
—which, as Sir Walter Scott asserts, is attested by evi- 
dence which neither Bacon, Boyle, nor Johnson were 
able to resist,—has not arrested the attention of some 
philosophical thinker qualified toinquire into the matter,  
-P-A-G-E-323
SECOND-SIGHT. 295 
and give what explanation may be possible. For my- 
self, I will only relate one incident which has always 
appeared to me very remarkable; and professing myself 
wholly unable to offer any explanation, I will simply 
detail the circumstances, which for five-and-twenty years 
have been clearly imprinted on my memory. 
About a quarter of a century has passed away since I 
started from D. to join a party of. tourists near 
Glasgow. We met, and determined that the gentlemen 
should take a walking and fishing ramble through Ross- 
shire and Inverness-shire, while the ladies should remain 
at the country-house of a friend, who had already ga- 
thered round her a merry group of young people, lately 
set free from the restraints of school, and bent on enjoy- 
ing the beauty and freedom of the Western Highlands. 
The walking tour over, all were to spend a few days 
there together before the party broke up. 
Our kind hostess was the widow of a Highland chief, 
and was descended from a family loug celebrated for 
possessing a more than usual portion of second-sight. 
She firmly believed that the prophetic mantle had 
fallen upon her, but her disposition was cheerful and 
lively, and being herself still young, she had a decided 
preference for the society of young people. 
Her residence was situated on the slope of a steep 
hill, about half a mile from the side of a beautiful lake, 
which it overlooked. The lake was at this point a mile 
at least in breadth, and on its opposite shore stood a 
small farmhouse, with a few enclosed fields around it. 
The lake was several miles long, and had its egress into 
a river, which in winter, or when swollen by the heavy 
rains which are common in hilly countries, was of con- 
siderable size, The only means of crossing this river 
was by a stone bridge about half a mile from the end  
-P-A-G-E-324
296 DREAMS. 
of the lake. : When I have added, that in the garden of 
our friend. was an inclosure which had for centuries 
been the burying-place of her husband’s clan, and im 
which ‘his remains were laid, I shall have given every 
particular necessary for the elucidation of the rest of 
the tale. 
A month quickly passed among the rivers and lakes 
of Scotland, and we found ourselves at the widow’s 
hospitable residence. Our welcome there was kind 5; 
but before an hour had passed, we could not help 
noticing that a gloom hung over the party lately so 
merry. The conversation was evidently forced. The 
younger ladies looked anxious and distressed; their 
hostess sad, almost stern, as they sat apart, speaking: 
little, and evidently wrapped in thought. Something 
unusual had plainly occurred, and we eagerly sought 
an evening walk with some of the younger ladies, that 
we might learn what had so completely transformed our 
hitherto cheerful hostess, 
The tale we were told was, in brief, as follows. 
About a week previously, Mrs, F (as we will de- 
signate the widow) had appeared at the breakfast-table 
deadly pale, and with bloodshot eyes. She was reluc-— 
tant to speak, and would not allow that anything was 
‘the matter, till towards evening a flood of tears relieved 
her, and she owned that she was distressed by a dream 
of thé night before, so remarkable and so vivid, that, 
she felt convinced it would be realised. She described 
it thus :— 
Looking from the windows of her house, she had 
seen a long funeral procession come up the opposite 
side of the lake, from the direction of the river-bridge. 
When they reached the small farmhouse, the horses 
were taken out of the carriages and turned into an  
-P-A-G-E-325
SECOND-SIGHT, 297, 
inclosure to graze; the coffin was brought down to the 
lake-side and placed in one of the boats, while the 
funeral party crossed in the large ferry-boat, commonly 
used for conveying cattle. On reaching the shore in front 
of Mrs. F—~’s house, the procession again formed, 
and proceeded to the graveyard, where the funeral took 
place; the earth was heaped on the grave, and the 
mourners departed. Without calling at the house, they 
recrossed the lake, harnessed their animals, and dis- 
appeared by the same road by which they had come. 
On hearing this narration, the young people had 
ridiculed the notion of attending to the fancies of a 
dream, and by their bright cheerful conversation had 
succeeded at last in restoring Mrs. F to something 
like cheerfulness, But towards evening on the following 
day, a horseman rode up to the door, and delivered a 
note from the undertaker of an adjacent town. This 
note announced that Mrs. F——’s mother-in-law had 
died suddenly at her residence, twenty miles off, and 
requested that a grave should be prepared for her in 
the family burying-ground. On inquiry, the messenger 
stated that the old lady had died at an hour coincident 
with the remarkable dream of her daughter-in-law, 
after a very slight indisposition, of which, in consequence 
of a family disagreement, Mrs. F had not heard. 
The whole party was struck with awe. The widow 
quietly observed, ‘ You see it is true,’ and retired to 
her own room for the rest of the day. On the fifth 
day the funeral took place, actually fulfilling, contrary 
to all likelihood, every circumstance connected with 
the dream. The old Jady had died at her residence, 
the road from which ran by the same side of the river 
and lake with Mrs. F——’s house; it was therefore 
most improbable that the funeral procession should   
 
-P-A-G-E-326
298 DREAMS. 
cross the lake. But all was to be accomplished. Om 
the night. preceding the burial a dreadful thunderstorm 
swept away the stone bridge, which spanned one of the 
mountain streams that flowed into the lake about a mile 
from Mrs. F——’s house. The result was, that the 
funeral party was unable to proceed by the road. They 
could not pass the stream, now a raging torrent, so they 
retraced their steps, and crossing the river, continued 
their journey on the opposite side of the lake. The 
lady of the house saw all from her windows—the horses 
turned loose to graze, the boats occupied exactly as 
foretold, the funeral completed, the last sod heaped om 
the grave, and the party turning to depart without even 
calling at the house of the nearest connection of the 
deceased. For the second time she saw it all; but with 
what feelings, who shall dare to say?

HOUSEHOLD TALES. 
INTRODUCTORY. 
Ir is only of late years that household tales have been 
regarded as of interest by men of learning. For long they 
were thought to be ‘milk for babes,’ but to have nothing 
in them which could repay a moment’s study by one who 
had emerged from childhood. But the great Grimm saw 
that in these stories for children lay fragments of ancient 
mythology, and he learned to trace them from land to land, 
and thus to prove them to be precious heirlooms, derived 
from our primeval ancestors before they parted into separate 
nationalities. The mine was discovered by Grimm, others 
have gathered ore from it, but none have thoroughly 
worked it out, tracing its veins, and exhausting its stores 
of mythologic wealth. 
The following tales are but few; they are the specimens 
merely, collected by one who has not the time to become a 
miner, but who delights occasionally in exploring the little- 
sought-after treasures which lie deep below the surface 
of society. 
A word first on the formation of household tales. 
Every language has its primary roots, and these roots 
united together, expanded, somewhat altered with wear- 
and-tear, become words. The number of radices is fixed. It 
is small; the words formed from them are innumerable and 
continually changing. 
There was a root in primeval Aryan languages which had 
the signification of enclosing, it was probably g (vowel) rd.
-P-A-G-E-328
300 APPENDIX. 
From this root we have a garden, a garth, a yard; to gird, 
a girdle; a ward, either one kept enclosed or an enclosure, 
of which the keeper is a warden; and a» measure of 
ldnd to be enclosed is a yard. So much for the crop 
sprung up in England from one root. In Russian, it has 
produced gorod, ari enclosed town, and goroditj, to enclose = 
the German garten, giirtel, &c.; the French jardin, the 
Latin hortus, the Greek xcproc, the Persian gird, a circum 
ference ; the Hindustanee girdd, a ring ; the Sanskrit grra, 
house—all spring from the same root. 
In all cognate languages we find the same roots which, 
however much altered, can be identified and reduced to 
their primitive form. : 
Much the same may be said of household tales. In all 
nations belonging to the same stock there exist stories re~ 
sembling each other in many particulars, and differing from 
each other in others; yet with an unmistakable radical 
unity about them, which makes it easy to reduce them to a 
primeval root. Who can doubt that jardin and garden 
are identical in signification, though they differ somewhat 
in spelling and in pronunciation? Sometimes in the same 
nation -one radical has developed into several distinct 
ideas ; as garden and warden : so with stories, they may not 
resemble each other in much that is superficial, yet a criti- 
cal eye can often perceive their radical identity.

have obtained two versions in Yorkshire (No. VII.) :— 
A boy ran away from home, and went into service; at the end of a year he received as wage an ass which dropped gold; this 
he lost through the treachery of a publican. He went into ser- 
vice a second year, and obtained in return for his services a table, 
which at his bidding covered itself with a profusion of dainties; 
this he lost ina similar manner. A third year’s service was 
rewarded with the gift of a stick, which at his command would 
knock aman down. By means of this stick the lad recovered 
his ass and table, and obtained a fortune and a wife. 
Now this is a version of a widespread story. Grimm, in 
his German Household Tales, tells it as follows:— 
A tailor had three sons, whom he drove away from home 
because a goat told stories about them. : 
The eldest son served a cabinetmaker, and at the end of a ye 
his master gave him a table which, when he bade it, was covered. 
with all he desired; an innkeeper steals it, supplying its place 
with an imitation. The lad goes home and calls all his relations 
together to dinner, then orders the table to deck itself, and because 
it remains unchanged, the relations are indignant, and think that 
they have been mocked. 
The second son served a miller, who gave him a gold-dropping 
ass; he had but to say ‘Bricklebrit!’ and the ass discharged a lot 
of gold pieces. This ass he lost much in the same way as his 
brother had lost his table, and it came into the possession of the 
same publican. 
The third son served a turner, who gave him a sack witha 
stick in it, and he had but to say, ‘Stick! ont of the sack,’ and 
it jumped out and laid about lustily ; by means of this stick the 
boy recovered from the innkeeper his brothers’ table and ass. 
There are several variations of this story in different 
parts of Germany. It is told by Bechstein in his Marchen- 
buch, p. 156; Zingerle picked it up at Meran in the Tyrol 
(Zingerle, pp. 84 and 185). Jt has been found in Swabia
-P-A-G-E-340
312 APPENDIX. 
(Meier, Schwibische Marchen, No. 22.); it has been met 
with in the Netherlands as well. The story is also common 
to Norway and Denmark (Asbjérnsen, p. 48; Etlar, p. 150) - 
It is told in the first edition of Steer’s Hungarian Tales ; it 
is found among the Polish Household Stories of Levestam. 
(p. 105), and among the Wallachian Tales of Schott (p. 20). 
The following is a Russian version of the same tale :—— 
There was once a peasant who had a terrible shrew for his wife, 
and they were both miserably poor. One day the peasant went to the 
mill to get some corn ground, and he put the flour into an open 
vessel which he carried on his head as he returned; the wind. 
was high, and it blew the flour away. When the peasant reached 
home, is wife beat him and scolded him for having lost the flour, 
and sent him to the wind to demand payment for the flour it had 
carried off 
He meets the mother of the winds, who brings him to her cave, 
and hides him in her oven, having first ascertained from him that 
the south wind was the thief. 
The winds come blustering into the cave, and the old woman 
demands of the south wind payment for the stolen flour. The 
guilty zephyr pays the peasant a basket, which becomes full of all 
‘ood things as soon as the owner says to it, ‘Basket, be filled !” 
Feving received this gift, the poor man goes home well satisfied. 
The wife, elated at having become possessed of such a treasure, 
invites a nobleman to supper; and this gentleman, discovering the 
properties of the basket, makes away with it. The peasant is sent 
y his wife once riore to the winds, and obtains from the south 
wind a jar, to which he says, ‘Five out of the jar, thrash her well !” 
and then, ‘Five into the jar!’ The peasant goes home, and is well 
scolded by his wife for having brought ajar; she takes up a 
pitchfork to beat him, when he exclaims, ‘Five out of the jar, 
thrash her well!’ and five men with flails leap forth, and give 
the shrew a good dressing. By the same means he recovers from 
the nobleman his miraculous basket. ‘ 
From that time forward he lives happily, his wife keeps a civil 
tongue in her head, and he eats and drinks what he desires. 
(Dietrich, No. 8,) 
The same story is related by Von Hahn in his ‘Modern 
Greek Household Tales ;’ but this is a variation again, and of 
a peculiar character, containing matter of mythological 
interest :— 
Aman and awoman had no children; the woman prayed that she 
might be granted one, even though it were a serpent; and in due
-P-A-G-E-341
APPENDIX. 313 
course of time she brought forth a serpent, which left the house, 
and took up its abode in a hole. 
The woman is a terrible shrew, and a bad woman to boot; she- 
brings the house to poverty, and then goes to the serpent to ask for 
relief. The serpent gives his mother a gold-dropping ass, warning’ 
her never to let it touch water. The couple live on the gold for 
some while, but at last the woman leads the ass to water, and it 
runs away and is lost. She goes once more to her child, who’ 
gives ber a pitcher, which does all that she wants; she sells this 
to the king, and is reduced to poverty. The old man now goes to 
the serpents lair, and obtains a stick, to which he says, ‘Up stick 
and do your duty!’ whereupon it knocks the woman on the head 
and kills her; so the man lives in happiness ever after. 
The same story, but varied again, occurs in the Penta- 
merone of Basile, a collection of Neapolitan Household Tales, 
told in the dialect of the people about Naples, made by 
Giambattista Basile, and published in 1637. It is as 
follows : 
There was once in Maregliano a good woman of the name of 
Maselle, who, besides six unmarried daughters, as tall as hoy 28, 
had a goose of a.son, to whom the snow was too hard for him to 
venture on making snowballs. - : 
Such a fool was Anthony, that the mother could endure 
him no longer in the house, s0 she took a stick to his back, and 
packed him off with a flea in his ear. He ran, and he ran, till he 
could run no further, and then he stood panting before a cave, in 
which he beheld a wild man,—and such aman! He was no taller 
than a dwarf, but had a huge head, brows which met, squinting 
eyes, a flat nose, and nostrils like the famous cloaca of Tarquinius 
Priscus, ‘The blessing of Heaven upon you, sit!’ said Anthony, 
making a profound bow. ‘The same to you, and lots of them,’ 
replied the wild man; ‘now, my boy, if you want service, enter 
into mine, and you shall receive good wages.’ 
So Anthony agreed, and remained servant to the ogre for two 
years, at the expiration of which time he asked for his wages, 
that he might be off to his mother. 
The wild man made no demur in paying him, but readily gave him 
a donkey as his hire. ‘But mind,’ said the ogre in parting with him, 
‘whatever you do, on no account utter the words, “Arre cacaurre,” 
for, by the soul of my grandfather, it will fare badly with you if 
ou do! : 
y Anthony mounted,the donkey and rode off; but he had not gone 
far before he desired to know what the effect would be which 
the mysterious words would produce. So he jumped off Neddy, 
and pronounced ‘Arre cacaurre’ at the top of his voice. At once, 
long-ear opened her mouth and dropped from it pearls, rubies,
-P-A-G-E-342
314 APPENDIX. 
emeralds, sapphires and diamonds, all as big as walnuts. Here 
was a catch! He pocketed the jewels and rode off to an inn, 
where he delivered Neddy to the care of the publican, enjoining 
him on no account to say ‘Arrecacaurre.’ Of course the imkeeper 
discovers the worth of the donkey, and robs the lad of her; so 
that the boy has to return to the ogre without his wage. 
‘At the end of a year Anthony received from the wild man a 
napkin, which he had only to spread, and then to say, ‘Napkin be 
covered,’ and it would be covered at once with a sumptuous 
repast. Anthony lost the napkin as he had lost the donkey, and 
‘was compelled to return to the ogre for another three years; at 
the end of which period his master gave him a stick, cautioning 
him not to say, ‘Up with you, stick,’ or ‘Down with you, stick,’ 
or by the soul of his grandfather it would fare ill with him. 
By means of this stick, as in the former versions of the story,Anthony 
recovers the napkin and the donkey, and besides repays his old 
mother the thrashing she had given him six years before. 
That these stories rest upon a common mythological 
foundation, there is strong evidence to prove. The gold- 
dropping animal, the magic table or napkin, the self-acting 
cudgel, appear in some of the tales of ancient India, and. 
their original signification is made apparent. : 
The Master, who gives the three precious gifts, is the All 
Father, the Supreme Spirit. The gold and jewel-dropping 
ass is the spring-cloud hanging in the sky and shedding the 
bright productive vernal showers. The table which covers 
itself. is the earth becoming covered with flower and fruit 
at the bidding of the New Year. But there is a check; 
rain is withheld, the process of vegetation is stayed, by 
some evil influence. Then comes the thunder-clond, out 
of which leaps the bolt; the rains pour down, the earth 
receives them, and is covered with abundance—all that 
was lost is restored. 
  
1, THE ROSE-TREE. (Devonshire.) 
There was once upon atime a good man who had two children : 
a girl by a first wife, and a boy by the second. The girl was as 
white as milk, and her lips were like cherries. Her hair was like 
golden silk, and it hung to the ground. Her brother loved her
-P-A-G-E-343
APPENDIX. : 315 
dearly, but her wicked stepmother hated her. ‘Child,’ said the stepmother one day, ‘go to the grocer’s shop and buy me a pound of candles,’ She gave her the money ; and the little girl went, bought the candles, and started on her return. There was a stile to cross. She put down the candles whilst she got over the stile. Up came a dog and ran off with the candles. She went back to the grocer’s, and she got a second bunch. She came to the stile, set down the candles, and proceeded to climb 
over. Up came the dog and ran ‘off with the candles. She went again to the grocer’s, and she got a third bunch ; and just the same event happened. Then she came to her stepmother crying, for she had spent all the money and had lost three bunches of candles. 
The stepmother was angry, but she pretended not to mind the loss. She said to the child: ‘Come, lay thy head on my lap that I may comb thy hair.’ So the little one Jaid her head in the woman's lap, who proceeded to comb the yellow silken hair. And when she combed, the hair fell over her knees, and rolled right down to the ground. 
Then the stepmother hated her more for the beauty of her hair; 80 she said to her, ‘I cannot part thy hair on my knee, fetch a billet of wood.’ So she fetched it. Then said the stepmother, ‘T cannot part thy hair with a comb, fetch me an axe.’ So she fetched it. 
. ‘Now,’ said the wicked woman, ‘lay thy head down on the billet whilst I part thy hair.’ 
‘Well! she laid down her little golden head without fear; and whist ! down came the axe, and it was off. So the mother wiped 
the axe and laughed. 
Then she took the heart and liver of the little girl, and she 
stewed them and brought them into the house for aupper. The 
husband tasted them and shook his head. He said they tasted 
very strangely. She gave some to the little boy, but he would 
not eat, She tried to force him, but he refused, and ran out into 
the garden, and took up his little sister, and put her in a box, and 
buried the box under a rose-tree; and every day he went to the 
tree and wept, till his tears ran down on the box. 
One day the rose-tree flowered. It was spring, and there among 
the flowers was a white bird ; and it sang, and sang, and sang like 
an angel out of heaven. Away it flew, and it went to a cobbler’s 
shop, and perched itself on a tree hard by ; and thus it sang: 
My wicked mother slew me, 
My dear father ate me, 
My little brother whom I love 
Sits below, and I sing above 
Stick, stock, stone dead.* 
* J think that these lines are not quite correct, @ line seems to be wanting.
-P-A-G-E-344
316 APPENDIX. 
‘ Sing again that beautiful song,’ asked the shoemaker. ‘If you 
will first give me those little red shoes you are making.’ The 
cobbler gave the shoes, and the bird sang the song; then flew to a 
tree in front of a watchmaker’s, and sang: 
my wicked mother slew me, 
y dear father ate me, 
My little brother whom I love 
Sits below, and I sing above 
Stick, stock, stone dead. 
‘Oh, the beautiful song! sing it again, sweet bird,’ asked the 
watchmaker, ‘If you will give me first that gold watch and chain 
in your hand.’ The jeweller gave the watch and chain. The bird 
tock it in one foot, the shoes in the other, and flew away, after 
having repeated the song, to where three millers were picking a 
millstone. The bird perched on a tree and sang: 
My wicked mother slew me, 
My dear father ate me, 
My little brother whom I love 
Sits below, and I sing above 
Stick! 
Then one of the men put down his tool and looked up from his 
work, 
Stock! 
Then the second miller’s man laid aside his tool and looked up, 
Stone! 
Then the third miller’s man laid down his tool and looked up, 
Dead! 
Then all three cried out with one voice: ‘Oh, what a beautiful 
song! Sing it, sweet bird, again.’ ‘Ifyou will put the millstone 
round my neck,’ said the bird. The men complied with the bird’s 
request, and away to the tree it flew with the millstone round its 
neck, the red shoes in the grasp of one foot, and the gold watch 
and chain in the grasp of the other. It sang the song and then 
flew home. It rattled the millstone against the eaves of the house, 
and the stepmother said, ‘It thunders.’ Then the little boy ran out to see the thunder, and down dropped the red shoes at his feet. It rattled the millstone against the eaves of the house once more, and the stepmother said again, ‘It thunders’ Then the 
father ran out and down fell the chain about his neck. 
In ran father and son, laughing and saying, ‘See, the thunder has brought us these fine things!” Then the Gina rattled the mill- 
stone against the eaves of the house a third time; and the step- mothersaid, ‘It thunders again, perhaps the thunder has brought 
something for me,’ and she ran out; but the moment she stepped
-P-A-G-E-345
APPENDIX. 317 
outside the door, down fell the millstone on her head; and so 
she died. 
This is the same story as’ the German talo of ‘The 
Juniper Tree,’ but it differs from it in many particulars. 
In the German story, the boy is killed, not the girl ; and he 
is killed by the shutting down of a lid of a box on his neck 
as he islooking at some apples. ‘The father is not made to 
eat of the flesh either ; though in the corresponding Greek 
tale of Asterinos and the Pulja, the bad woman tries to 
make the sister eat of it. In the Greek story, an apple-tree 
grows out of the grave, and bears a golden talking apple, 
not a bird. 
The same story is found in Scotland * ‘The Milkwhite 
Doo.’ In Languedoc, again, the same is told, the rhyme 
running thus: 
Ma maratre 
Pique patre 
Ma fait bouillir, 
Mon pére 
Le laboureur 
M’a mangé. 
Ma jeune sceur 
La Lisette 
M’a pleuré 
Et soupiré, 
Sous un arbre 
M’a enterré. 
tsion! tsion! 
Je suis encore en vie! 
A similar story, again, is told by the Bechuana, in South 
Africa. 
In the Hungarian tale (Erdélyi Nepmesck, 5) ‘A mosoly 
go alma,’ the life of two princes is bound up with golden 
pear-trees, which a stepmother hews down. From them 
goes forth a bird which lays two golden eggs, and out of 
these eggs come forth the princes unhurt. 
The millstone occurs in many household tales as thunder. 
T have no doubt that there is a mythological root to this 
curious story,

2, THE RIDDLE. (Devonshire) 
There was once a lady, very beautiful, and wellborn. For some 
Teason or other she was condemned to die a cruel death. 
She pleaded her case, and her beauty and her great goodnesa 
touched the judges, till they so far relaxed their severity, as to 
promise that she should save her neck if she could propose a riddle 
which they could not answer in three days. 
She was given a day to prepare. ‘They came to her in her cell 
to know the riddle. She said: . 
Love I sit, 
Love I stand; 
Love I hold 
Fast in hand. 
I see Love, 
Love sees not me, 
‘ Riddle me that, 
Or hanged I'll be. 
The judges could not guess, sd she was acquitted. Then she 
pave them the explanation. She had a dog called ‘Love.’ She 
ad killed it, and with its skin had made socks for her shoes—-on. 
these she stood ; gloves for her hands—and these she held; a seat 
for her chair—on that she sat; she looked at her gloves and she 
saw Love ; but Love saw her no more. . 
The following is the Yorkshire version of the Riddle 
story : : 
There was a man sentenced to death, but he pleaded hard 
to be spared, and the judge consented to set him free if he could 
propound a riddle which he could not solve, The next day the 
man offered the following for solution : 
Under the earth I go, 
Upon oak-leaves I stand ; 
T ride on a filly that never was foaled, 
And carry the mare’s skin in my hand. 
The explanation was that he had put earth in his cap, oak- 
leaves in his shoes, cut open a pregnant mare to obtain the foal, 
and made a whip of the mare’s ane

8. JACK HANNAFORD. (Devonshire.) 
There was an old soldier who had been long in the wars—so long, that he was quite out-at-elbows, and he did not know where to go to find a living. So he walked up moors, down glens, till at last 
he came to a farm, from which the good man had gone away to 
market. The wife of the farmer was a very foolish woman; the farmer 
was foolish enough, too, and it is hard to say which of the two was 
the most foolish. When you've heard my tale you may decide. 
Now before the farmer goes to market says he to his wife 
‘Here is ten pounds all in gold, take care of it till I come home.’ If the man had not heen a fool he would never have given the money to his wife to keep. Well, off he went in his cart to market, and the wife said to herself, ‘I will keep the ten pounds quite safe from thieves ;’ so she tied it up in a rag, and she put the rag 
up the parlour chimney. 
‘ There’, said she, ‘no thieves will ever find it now, that is quite sure.’ 
Jack Hannaford, the old soldier, came and rapped at the door. 
‘ Who is there P’ asked the wife. 
‘Jack Hannaford.’ 
‘Where do you come from ?” ‘ 
§ Paradise,’ 
‘Lord a’ mercy! and maybe you’ve seen my old man there,’ alluding to her former husband. 
‘Yes, I have.’ 
‘And how was he adoing ?’ asked the goody. 
‘But middling; he cobbles old shoes, and he has nothing but 
cabbage for victuals.’ 
‘Deary me!’ exclaimed the woman. ‘ Didn’the send a message 
to me?” 
‘Yes, he did,’ replied Jack Hannaford. ‘He said that he was 
out of leather, and his pockets were empty, so you were to send 
him. a few shillings to buy a fresh stock of leather.’ 
‘He shall have them, bless his poor soul! And away went the 
wife to the parlour chimney, and she pulled the rag with the 
ten pounds in it fron the chimney, and she gave the whole sum to 
the soldier, telling him that her old man was to use as much as he 
wanted, and to send back the rest. . 
It was not long that Jack waited after receiving the money; 
he went off as fast as he could walk. 
Presently the farmer came home and asked for his money. The 
wife told him that she had sent it by a soldier to her former 
husband in Paradise, to buy him leather for cobbling the shoes of 
the saints and angels of Heaven. The farmer was very angry, and he 
swore that he had never met with such a fool as his wife. But
-P-A-G-E-348
320 _ APPENDIX. 
the wife ssid that her husband was a greater fool for letting hex have the money. 
There was no time to waste words; so the farmer mounted his 
horse and rode off after Jack Hannaford. The old soldier heara@ 
the horse’s hoofs clattering on the road behind him, so he knew it must be the farmer pursuing him. He lay down on the ground, 
and shading his eyes with one hand, looked up into the sky, and pointed heavenwards with the other hand. : 
“What are you about there ?’ asked the farmer, pulling up. 
‘Lord save you!’ exclaimed Jack, ‘I’ve seen a rare sight !’ 
“What was that?’ 
‘ A man going straight up into the sky, asif he were walking on 
a road. 
‘Can you see him still 
‘Yes, I can.’ 
‘Where ?” 
* Get off your horse and lie down.” 
‘Tf you will hold the horse.’ 
Jack did so readily. 
‘I cannot see him,’ said the farmer. 
‘Shade your eyes with your hand, and you'll soon see a man 
flying away from you.’ 
Sure enough he did so, for Jack leaped on the horse, and rode 
away with it. The farmer walked home without his horse. 
“You are a bigger fool than I am,’ said the wife; ‘for I did 
only one foolish thing, and you have done two.’ 
This is undoubtedly the same story as ‘Not a pin to 
choose between them,’ in Norse Tales. A similar story is 
found, with variations, in collections of German household 
tales, It is told also in Wenzig’s West Slavonic Marchen— 
schatz, p. 41. It gives a glimpse of the curious semi-~ 
pagan ideas of Heaven which reign among the peasantry. 
4, SIR FRANCIS DRAKE AND THE DEVILS. 
Sir Francis Drake, the great navigator, determined to build a 
large mansion for himself at Buckland Monachorum. He brought 
masons and builders from Plymouth, Exeter, and Tavistock ; and 
they worked hard, squaring stones and setting them-in mortar ; so 
that the walls rose in one day six feet from the foundation. 
Next moming every stone was removed from its place and 
carried to a great distance.
-P-A-G-E-349
APPENDIX. 321 
The great Sir Francis Drake was very angry, but he could not tell who had done the mischief; so he ordered the builders to re- 
commence their work, and they built till they had raised the walls to the same level. Next morning every stone was removed. So then Sir Francis determined to find out who had done this. The builders worked as before, and at night Sir Francis hid himself in a tree and watched. 
At midnight the earth opened, and out came a multitude of little devils, chattering and laughing. They set to work at the stones of Buckland Monachorum House, and carried them away with the greatest ease, so that all the walls were demolished hefore cock-crow. 
Next day the workmen builded as before, and raised the walls for the fourth time. In the evening Sir Francis dressed himself all in white, and climbed into a tree. Presently the earth opened, ~ and out came the black little devils, chattering and laughing. 
Sir Francis let them come with a load of stones under the tree, 
and then he flapped his arms and cried out very loud, ‘ Kikkeriki?’ And the devils looked up, and saw the great white bird (as they 
thought him) sitting crowing in the tree; and they dropped all the 
stones and ran away, screaming with fright, thinking the end of 
the world would come. 
This story seems to be a fragment of an old household 
tale, which has suffered anthropomorphosis. It was pro- 
bably told of some fearless Jack long before Sir Francis 
Drake was born. The little devils are undoubtedly trolls 
or dwarfs. Iam not sure that I have got a correct or a 
complete version of the story, as it was obtained from a 
half-witted fellow, who told it me one day near Buckland, 
whilst I was engaged in opening a tumulus. 
5. THE THREE COWS. (Devonshire.) 
There was a farmer, and he had three cows; fine fat beauties 
they were. One was called Facey, the other Diamond, and the 
third Beauty. One morning he went into his cowshed, and 
there he found Facey so thin that the wind would have blown her 
away. Her skin hung loose about her, all her flesh was gone, and 
she stared out of her great eyes as though she’d seen a ghost ; and 
what was more, the fireplace in the kitchen was one great pile of 
wood-ash. Well, he was bothered with it; he could not see how 
all this had come about. . 
Next morning his wife went out to the shed, and see ! Diamond 
was for all the world as wisht a looking creature as Facey—nothing

‘Take care,’ cried one, who seemed to be the king, ‘let no bon

‘Well, when they had all eaten, and had de

tossing them one to another. One little ‘feg-be

The cock crew, 
Away they flew,   
and the farmer crept trembling to bed. 
This story is widespread. Vobun relates the following 
tale, picked up in the Vorarlberg: The night-folk came 
into a house, took the cow out of the stall, slaughtered it, 
and, along with the children of the house, ate it whilst the 
parents were at mass. One of the children broke a leg- 
‘bone. The night-follc collected the bones, wrapped. them 
in the skin, saying, ‘ There is no help for it, the beast must
-P-A-G-E-351
APPENDIX. | ‘ 323 
be lame ;’ and the cow rose up alive, but halting on one 
foot.* 
Similar stories are told in Switzerland, Canton Bern, 
Aargau, and in the Tyrol.t The same myth comes to us 
from Italy.t 
In the ‘ Legenda Aurea,’ the story is told of St. Germanns, 
The host slaughtered his calf for the saint, who arrived as 
a traveller; and after the meal the saint collected the bones, 
wrapped them up in the skin, prayed, and up rose the calf 
alive. Nennius relates a similar miracle of St. Garmon, so 
that the myth must be Keltic as well as German. Another 
Keltic saint, Mochua, performed the same miracle on a stag. 
Abbot William, at Villiers, performed it on an ox. § 
An Trish legend relates as follows: ‘Servan was a saint 
of approved prowess, and great good-nature. Once, when a 
hospitable poor man killed his only pig to entertain him 
and his religious companions, he supped upon the pork, and 
restored the pig to life next morning.’ | 
The same tale is told in Schleswig, with variations. J 
Now this story originates, among German and Scandi- 
navian peoples, from the Hddaic legend of Thor. One day 
the god Thor set out in his car, drawn by two he-goats. 
Spending the night at a peasant’s cottage, Thor killed the 
goats, and having flayed them, boiled and ate the flesh.

One day the knight came riding alc

the knight jestingly said he would sez. 
who should be her husband. He did so, and found, to his terror, 
that this girl was the same whom he had flung over the bridge and 
believed to be dead long ago. So, leaving his comrades, he rode 
back to the cottage and asked the fisherman to allow his daughter 
to take a letter for him to his brother, a noble knight, at Sear- 
borough. Then he wrote a letter to this effect :-— 
‘Dean Brorner,— Take the bearer and put her to death 
immediately. Yours affectionately.’
-P-A-G-E-353
APPENDIX _ 325 
_ Sealing this, he gave it to the girl, and she started on her journey. On the way she slept a night in a little inn. Now it fell out that a thief broke into the inn that night and entered the maiden’s room, where he found the letter, and opening it he read it, Then turning his dark lanthorn on the face of the slee ing girl, he thought, ‘How sad that this beautiful damsel should be the bearer of her own sentence of death! Surely she deserves a better fate.’ Then, taking a pen, he wrote on paper a note, as though from the lmight, telling the brother to marry the girl to his son. Having done this, he sealed the letter and’ placed it in the girl’s purse, whence he had abstracted the real letter. She, waking the next morning, and knowing nothing of what had taken place during the night, hastened to Scarhorough, where she was well received by the kmight’s brother. “He read the letter, and gave immediate orders for the celebration of her nuptials with the knight’s son, who was then staying at his castle. 
Some days after, the knight arrived at his brother’s mansion, 
and was much astonished and perplexed to see the course which 
affairs had taken, and to find that all his attempts to frustrate the purposes of fate had been in vain, However, he was not a bit” 
more disposed than before to take matters quietly, so dragging the 
poor girl to the shore by her hair, he drew his dagger to stab her. 
She fell on her knees and implored him to spare her life, on which 
he so far relented that he plucked a golden ring from his finger and 
cast it as far as he could into the tumbling waves, saying to her, 
‘Swear to me that you will not come within my si ‘bt till that 
ring is on your finger, and I will spare your life. he took the. 
requisite oath and fled the place. . Far and wide did she wander, begging from door to door, till at 
last she found a situation as cook in a nobleman’s house. One day, 
when guests were arriving, she looked from the window and saw 
the knight, her cruel father-in-law, and his son, her husband. 
Trembling, she hid herself in the kitchen, and her tears were 
mingled with the food she dressed. Just before dinner a fisher- 
man came to the door with a magnificent fish for sale. She took it 
in and began to clean it. Scarcely had she opened it when she saw 
something glittering in its stomach. She examined the shining 
substance—and, lo! it was the knight’s ring! Her heart was 
now full of joy, and her tears were lost in smiles. She cooked the 
dinner so well that the knight, her father-in-law, asked his host 
who was his cook. . 
‘A strange girl,’ replied he, ‘who came begging to my door, and 
whom I seceived into my house from charity. Ho! some of you 
servants, bid her come up into the dining-hall.’” . 
The girl, receiving this command, washed her face, braided her 
hair, and put on her best array; then, with the ring on her finger, 
she entered the hall where all were feasting.
-P-A-G-E-354
326 APPENDIX. 
The revellers turned to look at her, for she seemed as fair as the 
moon, as lovely as a rose, With an exclamation of rage and dis— 
may, the knight rose to his feet. He recognised her at once, and, 
drawing his sword, rushed forward to cut her down; but she held 
up her hand with a smile, and there he saw the ring he had cast 
into the sea. Now, at jength he acknowledged that he was 
owerless to resist fate, and suffered her to remain in peace with 
fie son, who loved her dearly, and she became famous through the 
land for her beauty, her courtesy, and her goodness, 
This story is made up of two story-radicals : 
A. The first as far as to the marriage ; 
B. The second from the marriage to the end. 
The first part of the story closely resembles ‘The Devil 
with the Three Golden Hairs,’ in Grimm’s Kinder-Mahr- 
chen, No. 29; to which aro also related a Swiss story of 
Vogel Greet (K. M. No. 165), a Swedish tale (Afzelius 2, 
161-167), a Norwegian (Asbjérnsen, No. 5),a Wendish tale 
(Haupt u. Schmaler, No. 17), a Hungarian (Mailan, No. 8), 
and a Mongolian tale in Gesser Khan, p. 142. In the 
German story a king takes the place of the knight, and the 
babe ‘is a boy born with a caul, and therefore fated to 
marry his daughter. He takes the boy and casts him into 
the water, and it is saved by a miller. The incident of the 
change of letters by the thief is the same. After this the 
German tale branches off in another direction altogether. 
A modern Greek household tale (Von Hahn, No. 20) is to 
this effect : It is prophesied that a babe will cause the death 
of a merchant; the merchant takes the child, as in the 
Yorkshire and German story, and casts it into the river, 
when it is saved by a shepherd. Then follows the recog- 
nition of the boy, when grown up, by the merchant, and 
the incident of the letter; after which the story goes off on 
another track. The same story exists in the ‘Gesta 
Romanorum.’* I+ is impossible not to recognise in the 
myth of Romulus and Remus an Italic form of the same 
widespread household tale localised. 
The second part of the same Yorkshire story is founded 
ona different root, and one which reappears in numerous 
tales. For instance, in ‘ Herodotus,’ it is told of Polycrates ; 
* Ed. Swan, vol. i. Tale 20.
-P-A-G-E-355
APPENDIX, 327 
in the old Provengal romance of ‘ Magelone’ it more closely 
resembles the form in the Yorkshire tale. If I remember 
aright, it occurs in one of the‘ Arabian Nights’ Entertain. 
ments ;’ and if so, it was a relic of Persian romance, and 
would, in all probability, be found in India as well. Iam 
not sure that it has not a mythical signification, and that 
the ring apparently lost in the sea, and recovered from it 
again, does not portray the sun cast, as it wero, by the 
power of darkness into the deep, and recovered again by 
the virgin Aurora or the dawn. The’ instances of the re- 
appearance of this root in household tales are too numerous 
to be specified. I may mention that it occurs in the 
familiar French ‘tale of ‘The Fair One with Golden Locks,’ 
and that we find it in all the kindred tales of the Aryan 
family. 
7, THE ASS, THE TABLE, AND THE STICK. 
(Yorkshire, West Riding.) 
A lad was once so unhappy at home through his father’s ill- 
treatment, that he made up his mind to run away and seek his for~ 
tune in the wide world. 
He ran, and he ran, till he could run no longer, and then he ran 
tight up against a little old woman who was gathering sticks. He 
was too much out of breath to beg pardon, but the woman was 
good-natured, and she said he seemed to be a likely lad, so she 
would take him to be her servant, and would pay him well. He 
agreed, for he twas very hungry, and she brought him to her house 
in the wood, where he served her for a year and a day. When 
the twelvemonth had passed, she called him to her, and said she 
had good wages for him. So she presented him with an ass out of 
the stable, and he had but to pull Neddy’s ears to make him begi: 
at once to ee—aw! And when he brayed there dropped from his 
mouth silver sixpences, halfcrowns, and golden guineas. 
The lad was well pleased with the wage he had + 
away he rode till he reached an inn. There he ordere 
everything, and when the innkeeper refused to provide 
out some assurance of being paid, the boy hied him t 
pulled the ass’s ears, and obtained his pocket full of m ost had watched the proceedings through a crack in t: when night came on he substituted an ass of his own 
cious Neddy of the poor youth, who, unconscious of 
having been made, fode away next morning to his fatt
-P-A-G-E-356
328 , APPENDIX. 
Now I must tell you that near the paternal cottage dwelt a 
Poor widow with an only daughter. The lad and the maiden were 
‘ast friends and trueloves; but when Jack asked his father’s 
leave to marry the girl, ‘Never, till you have the. money to keep 
her,’ was the reply. ‘T have that, father,’ said the lad, and going 
to the'ass he pulled its long ears. Well, he pulled and he pulled, 
till one of them came off in his hands; but Neddy, though he 
brayed lustily, let fall no halfcrowns or guineas. The father 
Picked up a hayfork and beat his son out of the house. I pro- 
mise you he ran. Ah! he ran and ran till he came bang against 
the door; and burst it open, and there he was in a joiner’s shop. 
‘You're a likely lad,’ said the joiner; ‘serve me for a twelvemonth, 
and I will pay you well.’ So he agreed and served the carpenter 
for a year and a day. ‘Now,’ said the master, ‘I will give you 
our wage ;’ and he presented him with a table, telling him he had 
ut to say, ‘ Table, fo covered,’ and at once it would be spread 
with an abundant feast. 
Jack hitched the table on his back, and away he went with it till 
he came to the inn. ‘Well, host,’ shouted he, ‘ my dinner to-day, 
and that of the best.’ 
‘Very sorry, but there is nothing in the house but ham and 
eggs.’ 
or Ham and eggs for me !’ exclaimed Jack. ‘I can do better than 
that.—Come, my table, be covered !’ 
At once the table was spread with turkey and sausages, roast 
mutton, potatoes, and greens, The publican opened his eyes, but 
said nothing. 
That night he fetched down from his attic a table very similar 
to that of Jack, and exchanged the two. Jack, none the wiser, 
next morning hitched the worthless table on his back and carried. 
it home. ‘Now, father, may I marry my lass?’ he asked. 
‘Not unless you can keep her,’ replied the father. 
‘Look here!’ exclaimed Jack. ‘Father, I have'a table which 
does all my bidding.’ 
«Let me see it,’ said the old man. 
The lad set it in the middle of the room, and bade it be covered ; 
but all in vain, the table remained bare. In a rage, the father 
caught the warming-pan down from the wall and warmed his son’s 
back pretty effectually with it, so that the boy fled howling 
from the house, and ran and ran till he came to a river and tum- 
bled in. A man picked him out and bade him assist him in making 
a bridge over the river; and how do you think he was effecting 
this? Why, by casting a tree across; so Jack climbed up to the 
top of the tree and threw his weight on it, so that when the man 
had rooted the tree up, Jack and the tree-head dropped on the 
farther bank. 
‘Thank you,’ said the man, ‘and now for what you have done T 
‘will pay you;’ sosaying, he tore a branch from the tree, and fettled
-P-A-G-E-357
APPENDIX, 329 
it up into a club with his knife. ‘There, exclaimed he; ‘take this stick, and when you say to it, “Up stick and fell him,” it will Imock anyone down who angers you.’ 
‘The lad was overjoyed to get this stick—so away he went with it to the inn, and as soon as the publican appeared, ‘Up stick and fell him!’ was his cry. At the word the cudgel flew from his hand and battered the old publican on the back, rapped his head, bruised his arms, tickled his ribs, till he fell groaning on the floor; still the stick belaboured the prostrate man, nor would Jack call it off till he had recovered the stolen ass and table. Then he galloped home on the ass, with the table on his shoulders, and the stick in his hand, When he arrived there his father was dead, so he brought his ass into the stable, and pulled its ears-till he had filled the manger with money. 
Tt was soon known through the town that Jack had returned rolling in wealth, and accordingly all the girls in the place set 
their caps at him. ‘Now,’ said Tak, ‘T shall marry the richest lass in the place; so to-morrow do you all come in front of my house with your money in your aprons.’ 
Next moming the street was of girls with aprons held ont, and gold and silver in them ; but Jack’s own sweetheart was among 
them, and she had neither gold nor silver, naught but two copper pennies, that was all she had. 
‘Stand aside, lass,’ said Jack to her, speaking roughly. ‘Thou hast no silver nor gold—stand off from the rest.’ She obeyed, and the 
tears ran down her cheeks, and filled her apron with diamonds, 
‘Up stick and fell them,’ exclaimed Jack; whereupon the 
cudgel leaped up, and running along the line of expectant damsels, 
Imocked them all on the heads ‘and deft them senseless on the pave- 
ment. Jack took all their money and poured it into his truelove’s 
lap. ‘Now, lass, he exclaimed, ‘thou art the richest, and I shall 
marry thee. 
Another version obtained in the East Riding: 
There was once a poor woodeutter who bed three sons, They. 
lived in a great forest and worked hard all day making fagots. The 
eldest of the three one day declared he was tired of his work, and 
should go and seek his fortune. He flung down his axe and started 
at once; he walked on and on till he was tired, and then sat down . 
on a hillside to rest. Just as he was falling asleep, a little man, 
not so high as his knee, stood before him, and asked where he waa 
going. ‘To seek my fortune, said the lad, ‘Well’, said the little 
man, ‘go on over yon hills, and you will come to a white house. 
Say Harry-cap has sent you, and you will be admitted.’ The boy 
got up and travelled on till he came to the white house. He said 
what the little man had bade him, and was at once told to enter. 
He slept well, and on the. morrow, when about to come away, 
the people of the house brought him asa present a purse, which had,
-P-A-G-E-358
330 APPENDIX. 
and always would have, one piece of money in it—no matter what 
piece was required, it was always there—never more than needed, 
never less. Delighted with his acquisition, the boy instantly set 
off homewards. He saw no more of Harry-cap, but thanks to 
the purse he Jacked nothing on the road. 
One evening when drawing homewards he stayed at an inn. 
The landlord’s daughter, who brought him refreshments, noticed 
his purse, and being a witch knew its powers and value. She in- 
structed her mother to make one exactly like it, and in the dead 
of night, while the lad was fast asleep, she stole into his room, and 
exchanged the purses. 
The counterfeit purse had one piece in it, just what she took 
care to charge him for breakfast, so that the defrauded lad did not 
discover his loss. On his arrival at home, he told the household 
the good news, and they called in the neighbours to hear it too. 
The neighbours did not know how to praise him enough, and at 
last, in a fit of generosity, he said he would give a piece of money 
to each. This, of course, he was unable to do. ‘Finding out the 
miserable cheat, the neighbours loaded him with abuse, and, had. 
not his own folk stood up for him, would have maltreated him in 
other ways. For what is so despicable as an empty purse ? 
The poor lad had to take to the woods again, but his example 
stirred up the second son to seek his fortune also, He set out, met 
Harry-cap in the same place, was directed to the same white 
house, and received as a parting gift from its inhabitants a round. 
table, which at his bidding would immediately be covered with all 
manner of dainty food. Overjoyed with his treasure, heset off home- 
wards, but staying at the same inn where his brother had tarried, he was in a similar way cheated by the witch-daughter. 
The neighbours were called in as before, and when disappointed of a promised feast, they cudgelled the poor lad unmercifully. 
Now the third son was a silent, thinking lad. He mused over 
the stories of his two brothers, and resolved to profit by their 
experience; he set off, met Harry-cap, went to the white house, 
and when coming avay received a stick which, when bidden by 
its owner, would thrash his enemies, and which was also a great 
help to him when journeying. Bearing in mind how his brothers 
had stopped at the same inn on the way home, and had missed 
their treasures soon afterwards, he resolved to be on the look-out. 
In the dead of the night he spied the witch-daughter creep into 
the room, and lay her hand on the stick. ‘Stick, bang her!’ he 
cried, and the cudgel (as if possessed by the whole Irish nation) 
began immediately to thrash the witch all round the room. In 
vain she begged for mercy till she offered him a purse always con- 
taining one piece of money, and a table that would always supply 
a dinner on demand. He took the treasures and set off homewards 
cheerily enough, stick in hand, purse in pocket, table over shoulder ; 
and so he entered the house. Summoning the neighbours as
-P-A-G-E-359
APPENDIX. 331 
before, they were” sumptuously regaled, and after dinner he i 
sented each with the piece of money promised them before. Then 
he said to them: ‘ When my brothers returned and could not enter~ 
tain you as they anticipated, you took no heed of their goodwill 
in offering you a share of their good fortune, but abused them 
instead of sharing their sorrow,’ and, turning to the stick, he ex- 
claimed ‘Bang’em !’ So out of the house it drove them, through 
the streets, and over the bridge; till the bridge bended, and my 
tale’s ended. 
8 THE PARROT. (Yorkshire.) 
There was once a grocer who had a beautiful parrot with green feathers, and it hung in a cage at his shop-door; it was a very shrewd sensible bird, and very observing; but it was a female, and as such could not hold its tongue, but proclaimed aloud all that it knew, announcing to everyone who entered the shop the little circumstances which had fallen under its observation. One day the parrot observed its master sanding the sugar; presently in came a woman and asked for some brown sugar. ‘Sand in the sugar!—Sand in the sugar !—Sand in the sugar!’ vociferated the bird, and the customer pocketed her money and rushed out of the shop. 
The indignant grocer rushed to the cago and shook it well. ‘You abominable bird, if you tell tales again, I will wring your 
neck!’ and again he shook the cage till the poor creature was 
all ruffled, and a cloud of its feathers was flying about the 
shop. 
Next day it saw its master mixing cocoa-powder with brick- 
dust; presently in came a customer for cocoa-powder. ‘Brick- dust in the cocoa!’ cried the parrot, eagerly and repeatedly, 
till the astonished customer believed it, and went away without 
his cocoa, A repetition of the shaking of the cage ensued, 
with a warning that such another instance of tale-telling should 
certainly be punished with death, The parrot made internal 
resolutions never to speak again. . 
Presently, however, it observed its master making shop-butter of 
Jard coloured with a little turmeric. In came a lady and asked 
for butter. 
‘Nice fresh butter, ma’am, fresh from the dairy,’ said the shop- 
man, 
‘Lard in the butter—lard in the butter!’ said the parrot. 
You scoundrel, you!’ exclaimed the shopman, rushing at the 
cage ; opening it, drawing forth the luckless bird, and wringing its 
neck, he cast it into the ashpit. But Polly was not quite dead, 
and after lying quiet for a few minutes, she lifted up her head and 
saw a dead cat in the pit.

pa tialloo? called. the parrot, ‘what is the matter with you, ‘om ?. 
No answer, for the vital spark of heavenly flame had quitted 
the mortal frame of the poor cat. ‘Dead!’ sighed the parrot. 
‘Poor Tom! he too must have been afilicted with the love of 
truth. Ah me!’ She sat up and tried her wings, ‘They are 
sound, Great-is truth in my own country, but in this dingy - 
land it is at a discount, and lies are at a premium.’ Then spread— 
ing her wings, Polly flew away ; but whether she ever reached her 
own land, where truth was regarded with veneration, I have not 
heard. No; she flew twice round the world in search of it, and 
could not find it. JI wonder whether she has found it now! 
9, THE HAND OF GLORY. (Vorkshire.) 
One dark night, after the house had been closed, there came 
a tap at the door of a lone inn, in the midst of a barren moor. 
The door was opened, and there stood without, shivering and 
shaking, a poor beggar, his rags soaked with rain and his hands 
white with cold. He asked piteously for a lodging, and it 
was cheerfully granted him; though there was not a spare bed 
in the house, he could lie along on the mat before the kitchen- 
fire, and welcome. 
All in the house went to bed except the cook, who from 
her kitchen could see into the large room through a small pane 
of glass let into the door, When every one save the beggar was 
out of the room, she observed the man draw himself up from 
the floor, seat himself at the table, extract a brown withered 
human hand from his pocket, and set it upright in the candle- 
stick, He then anointed the fingers, and applying a match to 
them, they began to flame. Filled with horror, the cook rushed. 
up the backstairs, and endeavoured to arouse her master and 
the men of the house; but all in vain—they slept a charmed 
sleep ; and finding all her efforts ineffectual, she hastened down- 
stairs again. Looking again through the small window, she 
observed the fingers of the hand flaming, but the thumb gave 
no light—this was because one of the inmates of the house was 
not asleep. 
The beggar began collecting all the valuables of the house 
into a large sack, and having taken all that was worth taking 
in the large room, he entered another. The moment he was 
gone, the cook rushed in, and seizing the candle, attempted to 
extinguish the flames. She blew at them in vain; she poured some 
drops from 4 beer-jug over them, and that made the fingers 
burn the brighter; she cast some water upon them, but still 
without putting out the light; as a last resource, she caught up 
.
-P-A-G-E-361
APPENDIX. : 333 
a jug of milk, and dashing it over the four lambent flames, they 
were extinguished immediately. 
Uttering a loud ery, she "rushed to the door of the apartment 
the beggar had’ entered, and locked it. The whole house was 
aroused, and the thief secured and hung. 
This is the same story which is told in Northumberland 
and elsewhere. 
10, THE GOLDEN BALL. ( Yorkshire.) 
There were two lasses, daughters of one mother, and as they came home from t' fair, they saw a right bonny young man stand it house-door before them. They niver seed such > bonny man afore, He had gold on t’ cap, gold on +’ finger, gold on ? neck, @ red gold watch-chain—eh! but he had brass. He had a golden ball in each hand. THe gave a ball to each lass, and she was to keep it, and if she lost it, she was to be hanged. One o’ the lasses, ’t was t’ youngest, lost her ball. (I'll tell thee how. She was by a park-paling, and she was tossing her ball, and it went up, and up, and up, till it went fair over ¢’ paling; and when che climbed up to look, t? ball ran along preen grass, and it went raite forward to t’ door of t’ house, and t’ ball went in and she saw ’t no more. ] 
So she was taken away to be hanged by t’ neck till she were dead, a cause she’d lost her ball. 
[But she had a sweetheart, and he said he would get ball. So he went tu’t park-gate, but ’t was shut; so he climbed hedge, and when he got tut top of hedge, an old woman rose up out of t dyke afore him, and said, if he would get ball, he must sleep three nights in t’ house. He said he would. 
Then he went into t’ house, and looked for ball, but could na find it. Night came on and he heard spirits move it courtyard; 
so he looked out 0’ t? window, and t’ yard was full of them, like 
maggots in rotten meat. . . . 
Presently he heard steps coming upstairs. He hid behind 
door, and was as still as a mouse. Then in came a big giant 
five times as tall as he were, and giant looked round but did not 
seo t’ Jad, so he went tut window and bowed to look out; and as 
he bowed on his elbows to see spirits it yard, t lad stepped behind 
him, and wi’ one blow of his sword he cut him in twain, so that 
the top part of him fell in the yard, and ’ bottom part stood looking 
out of t’ window. . 
There was a great cry from ¢’ spirits when they saw half, the 
giant come tumbling down to them, and they called out, ‘There 
comes half our master, give us ¢’ other half.”
-P-A-G-E-362
334 APPENDIX. 
So the lad said, ‘It's no use of thee, thou pair of legs, standin 
aloan at window, as thou hast no een to see with, so go join thx 
brother;’ and he cast the bottom part of t’ giant after top part. 
Now when the spirrits had gotten all t’ giant they were quiet. 
Next night tad was at the house again, and now a secon 
giant came in at door, and as he came in ¢’ lad cut him i: 
twain, but the legs walked on tut chimney and went up them 
‘Go, get thee after thy legs,’ said t’ lad tut head, and he cas 
’ head up chimney too. 
The third night +’ lad got into bed, and he heard spirits striving 
under the bed, and they had t’ ball there, and they was casting 
it to and fro. 
Now one of them has his Jeg thrussen out from under bed, 
so t' lad brings his sword down and cuts it off. Then another 
thrusts his arm out at other side of the bed, and t’ lad cuts 
that off. So at last he had maimed them ail, and they all went 
crying and wailing off, and forgot t’ ball, but he took it from 
under t’ bed, and went to seek his truelove. | 
Now t’ lass was taken to York to be hanged; she was brought 
out on t’ scaffold, and t’ hangman said, ‘Now, lass, tha’ must 
hang by ? neck till tha be’st dead.’ But she cried out; 
Stop, stop, I think I see my mother coming ! 
Oh mother, hast brought my golden ball

‘The portions of this curious tale which are enclosed within 
brackets were obtained from a different informant. It seems 
to be a Yorkshire version of Grimm’s ‘ Fearless John’ 
(Kinder-Mahrchen, 4). In both these is the giant cut in 
half, and the incident of the chimney, and also the wonder- 
ful bed. 
In one of Grimm’s versions of the tale, the lad is able to 
overcome the spirits by means of a stick which he obtained 
from a dead man on the gallows, the man having been hung 
for a theft which he had not committed. The boy brings 
him to Christian burial, and in reward obtains the stick. 
In the Yorkshire story, the lad saves a girl from the 
gallows by means of a golden ball he had recovered from 
the spirits. There is a family likenoss in the tales. 
The other portion of the story resembles the popular 
Essex game of ‘Mary Brown,’ which is thus played : 
The children form a ring, one girl kneeling in the centre; 
those in the ring sing out: 
Here we all stand round the ring, 
And now we shut poor Mary in. 
Rise up, rise up, poor Mary Brown 
And see your poor mother go through the town. 
To this she answers : 
I will not rise upon my feet 
To see my poor mother go through the street. 
The children bid her rise to see her poor father, then her 
brother, her sister, the poor beggars go through the street, 
and lastly, her poor sweetheart, whereupon she rises to her 
feet. 
The Swedish ‘Fair Gundela’ also resembles it.

Fair Gundela ! 
GUNDELA. 
What matters my father? My mother lives still. 
Thank Heaven for that! 
She is then informed that her mother, brother, sister, 
é&c., are all dead, and she invariably has some consolation 
to offer to herself; but when she is told that her truelove 
is dead she is inconsolable.

Well, he had a son, and he was flayed lest what she said

So he built a tower all round, and there was no door, no but a 
window high up. And he put bairn in there. And he put an old 
man it tower to fend for bairn, and he sent him food and clothes and. 
all he wanted by a rope up intut chamber. Well, when t’ lad was 
one and twenty, ont’ very day, it was cold, and t’ lad was 
right starved, so he said tut old man that he’d fain have a 
fire, and they let down rope and they pulled up a bundle of wood.

18, THE RAVEN. (Cornwall) 
A quarryman was working under a large block of stone, which was ready to fall. Of this he was not aware; but a raven saw his peril and determined to save the man. So the bird picked up a 
pebble and dropped it on the miner's head. 
‘ Nao along, thou foul bird,’ cried the man, and continued wor! Se 
' Theraven picked up another stone, and dropped it on the man’s 
head. The fellow swore and went on with his work, 
‘Then the bird flew to the shore and picked up a bit of wood from a wreck, and this he let fall at the man’s feet. 
‘Halloo ’ exclaimed he, ‘ Where that comes from there is more to he got!’ and flinging down pick and shovel, he ran to the 
beach. Down crashed the rock, but the man was safe, rescued by 
the kindly raven. . , 
Now, this story is told in ‘Taylor’s Remarkable Provi- 
dences’ as a fact, in these words :— 
EXTRAORDINARY INTERPOSITION OF PROVIDENCE. 
The following account was contained in a letter from Newcastle, 
dated January 18, 1766: ‘Not Iong ago, a countryman, making 
up a hedge near an old stone quarry in the neighbourhood of Sun- 
derland, went to eat his dinner (which he had with him) ina 
deep cavity or hollow place, to be sheltered from the weather ; and 
as he went along pulled off his hedging gloves or mittens, and 
threw them down at some distance from one another. While at his 
Z

repast, he observed a raven take up one of them, with which it fle 
away; and very soon afterwards the raven returned, lighted upo: 
the ground, took up the other mitten, and went off with that 
before. Being surprised, he arose to see if he could find out th 
reason of so odd an accident, and to observe what had 
his mittens. He hed hardly got clear of the quarry 
saw a large quantity of ground, full of loose pieces of rc 
down into the. very place where he had heen seated, an 
he had continued a minute longer, he must inevitably 
crushed to pieces,’ 
Here we have the tale christianised, and toned down td 
serve a pious purpose. The raven, inst 
Cornish tale seems to suggest, a guar: 
acting under the direction of Providence 
istic allusion to the wrecking propensituco vs use Uusuisi- 
man is swept away in the Northumbrian tale. 
14. THE GOLDEN ARM. 
There was once a man who travelled the land all ove 
of awife. He saw young and old, rich and poor, prett; 
and could not meet with one to bis mind. At last’! woman young, fair and rich, who possessed the sup.uwe, vuc crowning glory, of having a right arm of solid gold. He married her at once, and thought no man so fortunate as he was. ahey lived happily together, but, though he wished people to think otherwise, he was fonder of the golden arm than of all his 
witfe’s gifts besides. 
At last she died. The husband appeared inconsolable. He put 
on the blackest black, and pulled the longest face at the funeral ; 
but for all that he got up in the middle of the night, dug up the 
body, and cut off the golden arm. He hurried home to secrete 
his recovered treasure, and thought no one would know. 
The following night he put the golden arm under his pillow, 
and was just falling asleep, when the ghost of his dead wife glided 
into the room. Stalking up to the bedside it drew the curtain, 
and looked at him reproachfully. Pretending not to be afraid, he 
spoke to the ghost, and said, ‘What hast thou done with thy 
eeks so red?’. ‘All withered and wasted away,’ replied the 
ghost, in a hollow tone. . . 
«What hast thou done with thy red rosy lips ?’ ~‘ All withered 
and wasted away.’
-P-A-G-E-367
APPENDIX, 339 
‘What hast thou done with thy golden hair? —‘ All withered and wasted away.’ 
‘What hast thou done with thy Golden Arm?’— Thou 
hast it!’ 
N.B—The dialogue progresses in horror, till at the 
close, the ghost’s exclamation is shrieked out at the top of 
the narrator’s voice, the candle extinguished, and the young 
auditors duly panic-stricken. No one desires to know 
what became of the avaricious husband. 
15, THE FAITHFUL DAUGHTER. 
There was a wealthy gentleman 
‘Who did most wickedly 
‘With many more conspire against 
The king’s high majesty ; 
For which he was in prison cast, 
And bound with iron strong, 
And there he was condemn’d to fast 
Until his life were gone. 
This cruel sentence was pronoune’d, 
That till his dying day 
He should not have one bit of food 
His hunger to allay. 
And that if any one should dare 
To assist him night or day, 
A solemn oath the monarch sware, 
To take their lives away. 
Within this dismal horrid place, 
And chained to the wall, 
Fast down his aged wrinkled face,’ 
The scalding tears did fall. 
Most grievously be languished 
And bitterly did ery, ‘For want of bread, one bit of bread, 
T famish, starve, and die! 
*O that I had one crust to eat, 
My hunger to control! 
How precious is one grain of wheat Unto a hungry soul !

I freely would it give, 
All for'a little loaf of bread,

Or trodden in the mire, 
It would be pleasing to my taste, 
And sweet to my desire.

Or were I iad within the grave,

The richest in the town, 
Yet none durst come to succour him, 
Dreading the monarch’s frown. 
All but the youngest, and to her 
He had behaved unkind, 
Because that she had married 
Contrary to his mind. 
The youngest to her sisters went, 
| ladies, high and great, 
And there did bitterly lament 
Their father’s cruel fate. 
‘0 sisters dear, contrive some way, 
His life still to preserve ; 
He ina dungeon pines away, 
Condemned there to starve.’

“We can do him no good,

That we should ruin’d be oe , 
Therefore we think it is as good 
That he should die as we. 
His youngest daughter’s heart did ache, 
ost bitter did she cry, 
‘Shall we our father dear forsake In his extremity! 
Although he spurn’d me from his door, Because a poor man’s wife, 
Yet would I freely shed my blood To save my father’s life’

Unto the petace then she hies, 
And falling on her knee, , 
‘With wringing hands and bitter cries, 
These words pronounced she :— 
‘My helpless father, sovereign liege, 
fending of your grace, 
Is judg’d unto a pining death,* 
Wi in a dismal place, 
‘ Which I confess he has deserved— 
Yet, mighty prince,’ said she, 
‘Vouchsafe in gracious sort to grant 
One simple boon to me. 
It chanced so I match’d myself 
Against my father’s mind, 
Whereby I did procure his wrath, 
As fortune had assign’d. 
“And seeing now the time is come 
He must resign his breath, 
Vouchsafe that { may speak to him, 
Before the hour of death; 
And reconcile myself to him, 
His blessing to obtain, 
That when he dies, I may not then 
Beneath his curse remain.’ 
The monarch ted her request, Conditionally that she” Each day unto her father went, 
Should strictly searched be. 
Meat nor drink she could not bring, 
To help him there distress’d, 
But every day she nourish’d him 
With milk from her own breast. 
Thus by her milk he was preserv’d 
A twelvemonth and a day, 
And grew both fat and fair to see, 
‘Yet none could tell which way. 
The monarch, musing much thereat, 
At length did understand 
How he was fed—and yet the law 
Not broke on any hand.

And her great virtues shown, 
He ’d him, and honour’d her 
ith great preferments known. 
Her father ever after that 
Did love her as his life; 
And blest the day that she was made 
A virtuous loving wife. 
This ballad is framed upon the story of Anthony Molina, 
but it bears strong traces of having been moulded in the 
household laboratory. The three daughters and the old 
man, the two eldest married well, the youngest mated to a 
poor man, and therefore rejected by the father, the father 
falling into want, and the proud daughters refusing help, 
whilst the youngest, whose love he had despised, proving 
alone true, is the root of popular tales throughout the Aryan. 
race. We have the Keltic tale preserved by Geoffrey of Mon- 
mouth, in the history of King Lear and his daughters ; the 
German version is to be found in Von der Hagen, ‘Gesammt- 
abenteuer,’ li, 59 and 63; and the ancient Sanscrit tale is 
in the Pantschatantra, iii. 10, part of which runs as 
follows :— 
Tn a certain town lived a king called Bali, who had two 
marriageable daughters. These came day by day at sun- 
rise to their father and greeted him. The eldest said, 
“Mayest thou be ever victorious, O great king, through 
whose favour all men rejoice!’ but the younger only said, 
‘ Mayest thou, O king, enjoy what is ordained to thee!’ The 
King, exasperated at this, exclaimed, ‘Hey, my minister! 
Give this woman, who speaks thus rudely, to wife to the first 
stranger at the door, that she may enjoy what is ordained 
to her.’ She was then given to a miserable beggar who 
turned out to be a king’s son, and who in the end was able 
to do him a great favour.

16. THE MASTER AND HIS PUPIL. 
There was once a very learned man in the north-country who knew all the languages under the sun, and who was acquainted 
with all the mysteries of creation, He had one big book bound in black calf and clasped with iron, and with iron corners, and chained to a table which was made fast to the floor; and when he read out of this book, he unlocked it with an iron key, and none but he read from it, for it contained all the secrets of the spiritual world. It told how many angels there were in heaven, and how they marched in their ranks, and sang in their quires, and what were their several functions, and what was the name of each great angel of might. 
And it told of the devils of hell, how many of them there were, and what were their several powers, and their labours, and their 
names, and how they might Be summoned, and how tasks might be imposed on them, and how they might he chained to be as slaves to man. 
Now the master had a pupil who was but a foolish lad, and he acted as servant to the great master, but never was he suffered to 
look into the black book, hardly to enter the private room. 
One day the master was out, and then the lad, impelled by cu- riosity, hurried to the chamber where his master kept his wondrous 
apparatus for changing copper into gold, and Jead into silver, and where was his mirror in ‘hited he could see all that was passing in 
the world, and where was the shell which when held to the ear 
whispered all the words that were being spoken by anyone the 
master desired to know about. The lad tried in vain with the crucibles to turn copper and lead into gold and silver—he looked 
long and vainly into the mirror; smoke and clouds fleeted over it, 
but he saw nothing plain, and the shell to his ear produced only 
indistinct mutterings, like the breaking of distant seas on an un~ 
known shore. ‘I can do nothing,’ he said; ‘as I know not the 
- Tight words to utter, and they are locked up in yon book.’ He 
looked round, and, see! the book was unfastened; the master had 
forgotten to lock it before he went out. The boy rushed to it, and 
unclosed the volume. It was written with red and black ink, and 
much therein he could not understand ; but he put his finger on a 
line, and spelled it through. 
At once the room was darkened, and the house trembled; a clap 
of thunder rolled through the passage of the old mansion, and there 
stood before the terrified youth a horrible form, breathing fire, and 
with eyes like burning lamps. It was the Evil One, Beelzebub, 
whom he had ealled up to serve him. | 
‘Set me’a task!’ said a voice, like the roaring of an iron furnace. 
The boy only trembled, and his hair stood up. 
‘Set me a task, or I shall strangle thee!’
-P-A-G-E-372
344 APPENDIX. 
But the lad could not speak. Then the evil spirit stepp: 
Wards him, and putting forth his hands touched his throat. 
fingers burned his flesh. ‘Set me a task.’ . wos 
"Water yon flower,’ cried the boy in despair, pointing to a 
8erenium which stood in a pot on the floor. . 
Instantly the spirit left the room, but in another instant he re~ 
turned with a barrel on his back, and poured its contents over the 
flower ; and again and again he went and came, and poured more 
and more water, till the floor of the room was ankle-deep. . 
‘Enough, enough!’ gasped the lad ; but the Evil One heeded hina 
not; the lad knew not the words by which to dismiss him, and. 
still he fetched water. 
It rose to the boy’s knees, and still more water was poured. It 
mounted to his waist, and Beelzebub ceased not bringing barrels 
full, Jt rose to his armpits, and he scrambled to the table-top. 
And now the water stood up to the window and washed against 
the glass, and swirled around his feet on the table. It still rose ; 
it reached his breast. In vain he cried; the evil spirit would not 
be dismissed, and to this day he would have been pouring water, 
and would have drowned all Yorkshire, had not the master remem — 
bered on his journey that he had not locked his book, and had 
therefore returned, and at the moment when the water was bub- 
bling about the pupil’s chin, spoken the words which cast Beelze— 
bub back into his fiery home. 
This a popular tale all over Europe, and has been turned. 
into a ballad by Géthe. It is to be found in various parts of 
Germany, under a form much resembling that given above. 
Té is connected in all probability with the story of the 
quern which ground salt in the Norse tales,and ground 
and ground till it sank the ship, and is grinding still at the 
bottom of the sea, all because those who had stolen the mill 
did not know how to stop it, The Norse quern is found 
spoken of in Snorro’s Edda, but I hardly think it to be- 
Jong properly to Scandinavian mythology, but rather to be 
an importation from that of the Finns; for the salt and meal- 
producing quern is a great feature in the Suomi poems, and 
the Kalewala relates the story of its being stolen from 
Pohjola by the heroes of Kalewa.

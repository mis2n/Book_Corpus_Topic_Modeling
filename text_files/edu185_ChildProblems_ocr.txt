   CHILD PROBLEMS    
     INTRODUCTION 
   
  Socrmry is slowly beginning to realize that Child Prob- 
lems are the greatest problems of our time. This growing 
consciousness is a direct outgrowth of the increasing fore- 
sightedness of philanthropic workers and their continuous 
agitation in favor of preventive methods of social better- 
ment. The superiority of the ‘‘ounce of prevention” has 
long since been admitted, but the practical application of the 
principle has been inexcusably retarded. In recent years 
only have our sociological students emphasized the supreme 
importance of building our social structure on the child. 
“The child is father to the man” has become the motto of 
intelligent social work. It is slowly dawning upon the 
discerning philanthropist that the child is a bundle of 
miscellaneous potentialities and is portentous of good or 
evil almost exactly in proportion to the training and op- 
portunities which he receives during the plastic period of 
his childhood. Therefore the greater need of enthusiastic 
effort to mold the child into the symmetrically developed 
adult. If society would concentrate more of its now dis- 
sipated energies upon the problems of the child, it could 
with an equal expenditure of effort accomplish more good 
than can be realized from any other form of philanthropic 
endeavor. The problems themselves are, however, most 
varied and their solution must be the result of the most 
painstaking effort.

  2 INTRODUCTION 
1. Cuttp ProsiEems AND Herepirty. 
The task of relating the problems of childhood to hered- 
ity depends upon the work of biologists whose investiga- 
tions are continually adding to our knowledge of the subject. 
This knowledge will throw light on the degree of training 
of which children are susceptible. Certain facts have 
been so definitely established that the sociologist can use 
them as fundamental propositions upon which to build his 
system of preventive work. In many cases the child is 
_already doomed at birth, and no subsequent training can 
give to him a normal social life. Defective heredity is 
annually responsible for a large number of children who 
are condemned to lifelong handicaps, such as idiocy, 
imbecility, backwardness, deaf-mutism, blindness, pre- 
disposition to criminality, or certain forms of constitutional 
disease. As a result of such heredity these defects may 
be expected to reappear in the offspring of each subsequent 
generation. The problem of the defective child, however, 
oceupies a separate field and is necessarily excluded from 
discussion in this book. We can only allude to the guiding 
principle that the child be well born; that is, that he be 
endowed at birth with capacity for development into a 
perfectly normal individual. The accomplishment of this . 
result requires good parentage and depends upon work 
among adults rather than among children. 
2. Crinp ProBLems AND ENVIRONMENT. 
It is now clear that the development of the child is 
largely determined by his environmental conditions, both 
prenatal and postnatal. In the study of the influence 
of environment the opinion of the expert sociologist should 
carry weight, and his investigations are establishing certain 
conclusions upon which definite rules of action can now 
be based. The knowledge that a bad environment is 
 
-P-A-G-E-9
INTRODUCTION 5 
responsible for the seriousness of many of our child prob- 
lems paves the way for a more comprehensive and feasible 
treatment of the subject than could be given if bad hered- 
ity were the root of the difficulties. Much has already 
been accomplished by carrying into effect the suggestions 
of sociologists holding this point of view. Furthermore, pre- 
natal causes of defects in children must increasingly receive 
the attention of biologists in order that society may de- 
mand proper attention for the mother during the gestational 
period. To what extent a special psychical bent can thus 
be deliberately imparted to the child is not yet known. 
At present, comparatively little importance is attached 
to this idea, but the belief that causal relationships exist 
has considerable support. The more important question, 
however, is, What influence does the physical condition of 
the expectant mother have upon the physique of the child ? 
That the child may suffer constitutionally if subjected 
to abnormal conditions during the prenatal period is un- 
questionable. The foetus, if insufficiently nourished, may 
be retarded in its development, or defects in physical 
structure ensue, and the child may always remain a de- 
fective. The character of nutrition before and immediately 
after birth is one of the most important manageable factors 
in the physical development of the child. These phases 
of the subject should be studied in greater detail by the 
specialist. 
As has been shown by John Fiske, the absolute helpless- 
ness of the newly born babe and the prolongation of the 
period of childhood furnish the human being with untold 
possibilities of development. The comparative unim- 
portance of instinct and the supreme plasticity of the 
child allow the marvelous development of reason that 
man has enjoyed. The impressionable child easily yields 
to the influence of contact with the remaining members of 
the family. In early life certain characteristics and psy- 
; ‘- 
 
-P-A-G-E-10
  4 INTRODUCTION 
chical traits become relatively fixed owing to the constant 
association with special mental types. That part of the 
child’s psychical nature which is clearly and absolutely 
individual and unique is relatively small. The greater 
portion of his characteristic mental endowment is gained 
from the interaction of his own small mental nucleus with 
the minds of his parents and of the other members of the 
family. The fixation of traits in the human being should 
be a paramount consideration in the training and develop- 
ment of the child during the entire adolescent period of 
his life. It is well known how ardently adults cling to the 
beliefs and traditions acquired during childhood. Right 
training from the earliest self-conscious moments of the 
child’s life is, therefore, a matter of great sociological im- 
portance. Social heredity within the family — that is, 
the transmission of ancestral ideas, traditions, prejudices, 
and knowledge — is a powerful factor in the life of every 
normal individual. ‘Like father, like son,” is often largely 
the result of this species of communication and influence. 
The general tendency of the children to follow the religious 
and political inclination of their parents illustrates the 
power of social heredity, which is in actual fact a condition 
of environment. 
Most important among the conditions of environment 
are the home surroundings of the child. His home environ- 
ment continues comparatively unchanged for a longer 
period of time than do external conditions. Home life 
and adequate home training are, therefore, vital in the 
development of the child. Unless prevented, the boy, . 
particularly, soon becomes partially subject to influences 
emanating from without the home, and these in turn tend 
to mold his character as well as to affect his physical well- 
being. His associates, the manner of his life, the sani- 
tary conditions of school, street, alley, or workshop — all 
of these considerations directly affect. hoth his physique 
   
-P-A-G-E-11
  INTRODUCTION 5 
and character. Attention to the environment of the child 
both within and without the home is accordingly the sine 
qua non of the solution of our child problems. 
8. SocraL OBLIGATIONS TO CHILDHOOD. 
Nowhere does history indicate that so many rights 
( were accorded to childhood as are conceded to it to-day. 
Men have been accustomed to life in the present, taking 
but little thought of the morrow. They have considered 
but slightly the influence of the existing condition of society 
on the character of the society of the future. As thought 
for the morrow has increased, society has become more 
unselfish and has begun to build for the interests of the 
coming generations. This has frequently involved a rela- 
tive subordination of immediate interests and has been 
accompanied by considerable cost. The self-abnegation 
of society consists usually of the sacrifice of present pleas- 
ures for the future advantage of the race. Carried out 
consistently, such a policy eventually results in the de- 
velopment of certain rights of childhood. Some of these 
expanding rights are not yet adequately recognized by 
society. As the existence of abstract rights may be ques- 
tioned, it will be less confusing to consider these claims 
upon the present generation as obligations to childhood. 
a. The Preservation of Life. 
The first claim of the child upon society is that of proper 
care while a helpless babe so that he may retain the inde- 
pendent life given to him at birth. He was not consulted 
in regard to the desirability of coming into existence and 
had no power to will or forbid this event. The individuals 
who are responsible for his birth have therefore incurred 
new responsibilities and obligations. The child has a right 
to a fair chance for life. If parents are delinquent in fur- 
nishing their children with this opportunity, it is the clear 
duty of the state to interfere in behalf of defrauded child- 
 
-P-A-G-E-12
  6 INTRODUCTION 
hood. The duty of society to the child must be gradually 
extended because parental neglect imposes a relatively 
greater social loss and cost as civilization advances and 
becomes more complex. Society should determine what 
class of children shall be allowed to come into existence, 
but, once born, all normal children have the unequivocal 
right to be saved from all forms of preventable death. 
The right to life is indicated in the penalty for the pre- 
meditated destruction of foetal life. Primitive society, 
however, seldom recognized this obligation, and many 
tribes even claimed the right to sacrifice all children who 
were not desired. Infanticide has been a common prac- 
tice among nearly all savage peoples and was not unknown 
among semicivilized tribes. The Africa and Asia of to- 
day still furnish numerous examples of this practice. Not 
only has it been customary to slay the weak, crippled, and 
defective, but the life of all, especially that of female chil- 
dren, depended upon the caprice of the parents. ‘For- 
tunately, civilized nations with higher ideals have con- .« 
trolling power among these barbarous peoples, and the 
crime of infanticide has been almost abolished. 
Among the poor in our own country and also in other 
civilized lands a situation has arisen which in general 
results does not differ materially from the infanticide of old. 
This statement may be illustrated by many authenticated 
cases of which the following is an ordinary example: In 
one of our large cities a mother has given birth to eleven 
children, all of whom, with two exceptions, are now dead. 
Ignorance and lack of care have been the predominant 
causes of this heavy mortality. The last two children were 
twins, and owing to absolute inability and ignorance on the 
part of the mother they became badly diseased. The 
physician recommended that they be sent to the hospital, 
but the mother at first refused to allow them to go. When 
finally taken they died within a few days. Society has 
ili as  
-P-A-G-E-13
ee ee ee 
INTRODUCTION 7 
still to learn the vital truths that its own interests are para- 
mount, that mothers have a right to knowledge and oppor- 
tunity, and that such instances of cruelty must not be 
tolerated. In sheer self-defense, society must develop 
the principles of justifiable interference with the species 
of neglect illustrated above. Our obligations to extend 
to infants the right to life demand this development. 
b. The Preservation of Health. 
Nothing militates against future industrial and social 
efficiency so much as does the absence of health. Without 
health, education and training are almost impossible and 
the physical and mental faculties are permanently impaired. 
Boys need to be given the opportunity to grow up into 
robust men, and in the case of the girls, physical training 
and muscular exercise are even more necessary, especially 
since the tendency of civilization has been to retard that 
symmetrical development which our future mothers need. 
The keen competition of to-day and the new demands of 
social and industrial life are so important that the growing 
child must demand that he be physically prepared to meet | 
the exigencies of anew era. Otherwise he will soon join the 
ranks of the great and constantly increasing army of the 
unfit’ and unemployable. A changing social attitude 
toward the problem of the child’s health is a natural con- 
sequence of this danger. The recent movement in favor 
of medical inspection of school children is a case in point. 
Society must. care for the diseased and disabled. But 
much more important is the task of insisting upon repair- 
ing the palpable physical defects of our children so that the 
age of incapacity may be indefinitely postponed. The 
realization of such a program demands extension of public 
authority which may at present appear almost entirely 
unwarranted, yet the course of civilization is inexorably 
carrying us in this direction. 
| The legitimacy of the prohibition of child labor is in part 
ek ie a ae ae  
-P-A-G-E-14
OC << 
8 INTRODUCTION 
based upon the physical injury which such work entails. 
The danger is accentuated by the double source from which 
it emanates — the pernicious influence of factory life upon 
the immature and undeveloped body, and the inability of 
the plastic and growing body to withstand the arduous 
task of continued manual labor. That the child must not | 
be compelled or allowed to sacrifice his health for the mere 
pittance which he earns is now generally accepted ; “Al- 
though not more than seventy-five years ago reputable 
economists opposed interference by the state in behalf 
of the little ten-year-old child working underground in the 
coal mines of England! The social obligation to child- 
hood in this respect has developed with a fair degree of 
rapidity, and the near future will witness the emergence 
of this obligation into a definite right, which cannot be 
gainsaid nor overthrown. 
c. The Right to Play. 
vAll animals play. Play is likewise one of the funda- 
mental instincts of the child. If there are any inherent 
rights of childhood, the right to play must be considered 
one of them. It carries with it immeasurable benefits, but 
the exact results still remain comparatively uncertain. 
It is unquestionable, however, that play promotes the 
physical and mental development of the child and that it 
is no mean factor in his social and moral elevation. “In 
fact the social value of play is one of the incontrovertible 
reasons for the furtherance of the playground movement. 
| VThe democratic impulses which well-regulated play fosters 
| are an urgent need of the present era. 
The ancient attitude toward play was that of toleration 
of the ebullient spirits of the growing boy. It was a ram- 
pant impulse which could not be checked, so parents sub- 
mitted from necessity. The utilitarian function of play 
was undreamed of. The physical weakness of the child 
and his incapacity for concentrated thought and endeavor

saved to him the enjoyment of play until his parents could 
use his services in some gainful occupation. Work was 
substituted for play as soon as the most limited degree. of 
success offered some justification for such action. Play — 
the most enjoyable right of childhood — was unduly cur- 
tailed, and even at the present day its value is minimized 
by many who do not recognize its varied functions. Dis- 
regarding the different theories respecting the. origin of 
play either in animals or in man, the present social value 
of play can not be denied. Play involves freedom from 
work and adequate leisure from the duties of the school- 
room. Nor can it be socially successful without sufficient 
space or playground facilities. Consequently a new duty 
of society has arisen — that of providing the child with 
ample field for the enjoyment of the opportunity to play. 
d. The Right to Freedom from Work. 
Prominent among the rights of the child must be the 
right to abstain from the task of @ ming money either 
for his own support or to increase the family income. 
Premature child labor is an absolute evil and is wholly 
without justification. Employment of children under a 
certain age in factories, mills, workshops, mercantile estab- 
lishments, and in the street trades inflicts irremediable 
consequences. Among the principal results of such prema- 
ture child labor are: the danger to health and physical 
development ; the handicap in the acquisition of a trade ; 
the mental retardation involved; the real loss of oppor- 
tunity for self-deyelopment ; the bar to future social and 
industrial efficiency; the incentive to criminality afforded, 
and the consequent moral degradation. The question 
of child labor is therefore fraught with deep meaning for 
future generations, and has become an important social 
problem. 
The enlightened view of to-day refuses to regard the 
child as a mere commercial asset of the parent. On the 
   
-P-A-G-E-16
eee 
10 INTRODUCTION 
contrary the relation of the two is exactly reversed. Until 
children reach a certain age it is absolutely necessary that 
they be supported by their parents, and society must en- 
force this obligation. “The child as interest-bearing capital 
has no place in the enlightened civilization of our present 
industrial age. The right of society to restrict labor in 
factories and establishments of all kinds, while now gen- 
erally recognized, does not include the right to restrain 
parents from using their children for gainful purposes. 
Until the community recognizes the social interests in- 
volved in such interference, it will be necessary for private 
agencies to use their influence in behalf of the child. 
Freedom from work does not legitimize idleness. Y‘The 
idle child soon becomes the victim of its wayward impulses, 
or of incorrigible companions, and rapidly degenerates. 
| The evils of idleness are perhaps more serious than those of 
work, but this fact in no way justifies premature child 
labor. Childhood isg@period of training when preparation 
for the duties of life is being made and while society must 
demand rigid requirements of the growing child, these 
requirements are entirely consistent with his general wel- 
fare. The adjustment of the individual in our industrial 
and social relations is so delicate that nothing can be over- 
looked to make that adjustment perfect. The more dif- 
ficult the adaptation, the greater the need of previous 
training and of preparation for the individual’s life work. 
Accordingly an adequate program for the development of 
the child must be adopted. 
e. The Right to Education. 
The educational advantages which society must grant to 
the child are at least threefold: literary and industrial 
training; moral education; and a knowledge of the ele- 
ments of sex physiology,) Without extensive development 
along each of these very important lines, many social evils 
will remain to retard the progress of mankind. In our   
 
-P-A-G-E-17
  INTRODUCTION i 
complex social life of to-day, education has assumed star- 
tling importance. Comparatively illiterate men have 
until recently been able to acquire a considerable compe- 
tence and even to amass a large fortune. This is no longer 
possible, and without training few men can hope to suc- 
ceed. A large percentage of our recent immigrants are 
illiterate; but illiteracy abroad, owing to relatively simple 
conditions, does not constitute the handicap that it does 
in the United States. If the injury resulting from ignorance 
were confined to the individual affected, the community 
would hardly be justified in interfering; but an entire group 
may suffer because of the ignorance of one of its members, 
. and may therefore be forced to lower their standard of life. 
VCompulsory education is a justifiable measure of coercing 
the negligent. 
The training required must meet the direct occupational 
need of the child. Otherwise it is only a halfway meas- 
ure, and society has not fully disqrged its obligations. 
Machine production and the consequent extensive divi- 
sion of labor necessitate some preparation for trade life. 
The growing problem of unemployment cannot be solved 
unless greater attention is paid to the untrained child. 
VLow wages and shameful conditions of living are partly due 
to defective education. Society must furnish the individual 
with the initial equipment necessary for a life of usefulness 
and profit. The most important step in the direction of 
equalization of opportunity is training for industrial effi- 
ciency. But the other interests of the child should also 
receive due recognition, therefore literary training cannot 
be neglected. 
Recent developments also demand a revision of the 
methods pursued in providing our youth with a moral 
education. The child is the unshaped marble out of which 
is hewn the virtuous ‘han or thé“ criminal.” Shall no one 
superintend the sculptor’s work? The results of improper 
 
-P-A-G-E-18
    12 INTRODUCTION 
and insufficient moral training are already too evident. 
By providing effective moral training for the child, society 
can prevent such criminality as is due to wrong methods 
of training ; and so much at least the present owes to the 
future. 
A form of education which is now demanding increased 
attention is discreet education along the lines of sex physi- 
ology. So direful have been the consequences, especially 
to the female sex, of the absence of needed knowledge that 
advanced thinkers are justly demanding reform. The 
adolescent youth of to-day should be protected from the 
bitter results of an ignorance which depends upon the mis- 
taken ideals of parents and upon the failure of the schools 
to appreciate the problem. The physical welfare of society, 
the happiness of the home, and the social emancipation of 
woman, depend in large part upon sufficient, rational, and 
timely instruction in this subject. Wt is a child problem, 
because the instruct. cannot be delayed until the young 
mind is blackened by the evil teaching of the vicious. 
The duty of society to care for the dependent and neg- 
lected child admits of no controversy. Such children are 
not responsible for their misfortunes, and society is pledged 
to grant them opportunities for a useful life. This general 
duty of society, coupled with the expanding rights of child- 
hood as outlined above, gives rise to the series of child 
problems discussed in this book under the following heads :

CHAPTER I 
INFANT AND CHILD MORTALITY. ‘iISTORICAL* 
1. InrRopucrory. 
The abstract right of the child to life has slowly received 
concrete expression in measures designed to reduce infant 
and child mortality. Happily the history of the world 
demonstrates the possibility of almost unlimited progress. 
The gradual decrease in mortality during the centuries 
indicates that ameliorative forces have been constantly 
in operation. Mortality rates both for infants and adults 
depend upon many complex considerations, and society is 
learning the social, economic, and physiological factors 
which determine the fluctuations, gains, and losses. “The 
economic conditions, the social environment, the moral 
and intellectual standards, and the advance in medical 
science of any community are reflected in the vitality of 
its children, In fact, the infant and child mortality of a 
people is a barometer of their social progress. 
1 The subject of vital statistics has become increasingly important in 
the United States and will, we hope, ere long faithfully reflect our general 
mortality rates and enable us to reason concerning our social and eco- 
nomic defects, and to point out the improvements possible‘ along other 
scientific lines, including, of course, the medical. We are far behind 
other countries in this respect. Especially is this true of the older Euro- 
pean countries, which have all given considerable attention to the careful 
collaboration of statistics on these vital matters. They are, therefore, 
able to follow more closely and with greater accuracy the exact tendencies 
which are evident. About one third of our states (Maine, New Hamp-

  16 CHILD PROBLEMS 
The problem of infant mortality formerly received but 
little attention apart from occasional references to the sub- 
ject by physicians. When birth rates were high, the social 
consequences of a large annual loss were hardly apparent, 
and the matter received ttle consideration. In recent 
years loss of life has become « very serious problem and the 
individual has become relatively more valuable.. Moral 
obligations now compel us to save life whenever possible. 
The history of, and present facts relating to, infant mortality 
therefore clearly indicate the nature of the problem, the 
duties of society, and the methods necessary to secure 
lower death rates. 
2. Decurne 1n THE Deatu Rates oF CHILDREN. 
In investigating the present waste of child life we must 
‘not overlook the progress of the last two centuries. We 
cannot deny our immeasurable superiority over the civiliza- 
tion of two hundred years ago. Then a large majority of 
the children born in London perished before they reached 
the fifth year of life. What a brutal waste of energy and 
life blood such a record of mortality shows! Yet the be- 
ginnings of national life throughout Europe were accom- 
shire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, 
New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, District of Columbia, Wisconsin, 
Michigan, Indiana, California, Colorado, and South Dakota) collect 
their vital statistics in sufficient detail to justify the Bureau of the Cen- 
sus in including them in its list of registration states. A large number 
of cities in other states also cover this ground so well as to be included 
in the list of registration cities. The entire registration area at present 
comprises more than one half of our total population. The facts in 
regard to birth rates are not treated adequately and have a limited value 
only. Likewise, the records of infant death rates are not precise and do 
not reveal the exact situation, but are more nearly correct than the 
statistics relating to birth. Therefore the computation of the rate of 
infant mortality on the basis of the recorded number of births will lead 
to a small percentage of error. On the whole, however, tendencies are 
certainly indicated and comparisons can be made between different cities, 
states, and localities. Sufficient accuracy has been attained to enable 
the sociologist to use the statistics for practical purposes.

   panied by a similar waste of child life. A 
population of nearly every European count: 
but slowly until about 1750. The infant mortal} 
London was little higher than that of other English cities, 
and all England as well as the continent lived beneath the 
pall of the blighting destroyer of little children. Even as 
late as 1761, 50 per cent of the English population died 
before reaching the age of twenty. The enormous gain 
of to-day is not appreciated until one realizes that at 
present one half of the people of England live until the 
fifty-fourth year has been reached-<It will occasion no 
surprise to learn that in Prussia during the decade 1751- 
1760, only 312 out of every 1000 children survived to the 
age of ten.!) In other words, two thirds of the entire popu- 
lation failed to reach an age of social usefulness, and per- 
ished while still a burden to parents and a cost to society. 
Russia likewise has been a laggard in its attention to the 
moral and social conditions which result in a low infantile 
death rate. It has been estimated that at the beginning 
of the nineteenth century only one third of the children of 
Russian peasants grew to maturity and that not more than 
36 per cent of the entire population of Russia reached the 
age of twenty years! Not so many years ago many scien- 
tists believed that a city population left to its own repro- 
ductive powers would gradually die out. Luckily this 
dismal philosophy has been dissipated by the humanitarian 
and scientific progress of our recent civilization. Cities 
actually do maintain themselves by means of a birth 
rate larger than their death rate. Although they draw 
heavily upon the rural districts, they would still in- 
crease in size were they to rely entirely upon their own 
native vitality.

tics, as well as most figures for the eighteenth century and before, prob- 
ably contain a considerable percentage of error.

  CHILD PROBLEMS 
ICAL STAGES. 
ral irst Period. 
The history of infant mortality is roughly divided into 
three separate stages or periods, each characterized by its 
own distinctive features and results. No date can be 
given for the beginning of the first stage, which represents 
the period during which the costly inactivity of society 
was slowly succeeded by increased attention to the lot of 
the newly born and helpless child. Only the most patent 
and active causes of mortality were removed, however. 
During this period began the triumph of man’s power over 
disease. The absence of preventive medicine and in- 
capacity to cure disease were serious handicaps, and prob- 
ably the history of the Caucasian race furnishes no more 
striking example of the power and havoc of scourge than 
that of smallpox. Formerly it was the most frightful 
of contagious diseases, and very few individuals — prob- 
ably not more than 4 per cent of all persons reaching the 
age of thirty — escaped all attacks of this ever present: 
plague. Two thirds of the entire infant population are 
said to have been attacked, and a large mortality resulted. 
Westergaarde points out that in Sweden during the decade 
1751-1760, 13 per cent of all deaths were due to smallpox 
—a proportion far in excess of that caused by the ‘‘ White 
Plague” of to-day. Owing to the high rates of mortality 
which then prevailed, the absolute death rates from small- 
pox were enormous. During certain years the proportion 
in France rose to 10 per cent, while that in Liverpool has 
been as high as 20 per cent. Toward the close of the 
eighteenth century, the remarkable discoveries of Jenner 
finally brought smallpox into subjection. A very rapid 
decline of the mortality from this disease has taken place, 
and now deaths from smallpox’ are almost a negligible 
factor in the records of vital statistics. The pitted faces 
   
-P-A-G-E-25

INFANT AND CHILD MORTALITY 19 
once so prevalent are seldom seen to-day, and because of the 
comparative elimination of this disease, the average dura- 
tion of life has been increased three and one half years. 
On account of its frequency, smallpox was formerly a 
children’s disease ; to-day in the United States the average 
age of persons dying from it is about twenty-seven years. 
Vaccination has saved the adult as well as the child. 
The progress which was made during this period isfurther _ 
illustrated by the decreased variations in the general death 
rates of London.t. The death rates during certain years 
in the decade 1740-1750 was 60 per cent higher than that 
occurring in other years of the same decade. During the 
following half century, fluctuations of 3314 per cent were 
common, but in the decade 1820-1830 the variations did 
not exceed 20 per cent. Even such a percentage would 
furnish occasion for alarm at the present day. 
Among the important reforms inaugurated during the 
first period were better housing, more effective sanitation, 
and the conquest of famine. Furthermore, notable con- 
tributions to medical science, improvement in the quantity 
and quality of food, the general introduction of sanitary 
measures, and the promotion of better hygiene, finally 
mark the culmination of this period, which came to a close 
about 1840. The former waste of child life had by that 
time been reduced to rates of mortality but little above 
those prevailing at the present time. 
b. Second Period. Stationary. 
The second period lasted until the very recent past, and 
many localities still retain the characteristics of this stage. 
Extensive reforms had been accomplished in the former 
period, therefore society settled down to a time of com- 
parative indifference and neglect, of which little children 
were the unhappy victims. Accordingly, during the last 
fifty years the death rate in England for children under 
1 Roscher, William, Political Economy, Vol. II, p. 308.   
 
-P-A-G-E-26
   
  20 CHILD PROBLEMS 
one year of age has remained practically unchanged, 
although the general death rate has decreased 18 per cent. . 
This fact indicates indifference to the causes of infant 
mortality. France actually showed an increase in infant 
death rates between 1840 and 1880, and in many German 
localities alarming rates still prevail. In Massachusetts 
the mortality of children under the age of one increased 
slightly between 1856 and 1895, but meanwhile the death 
rates of children under five slowly declined. These facts 
indicate that the needs of infants were not understood, nor 
were the means of meeting such needs known. The pe- 
culiar susceptibility of the babe to the smallest environ- 
mental change, whether in external conditions or in char- 
acter of food given, was not appreciated. Furthermore, 
infants suffered from the comparatively low value at which 
they were rated. 
Perhaps the all-absorbing growth of industrialism de- 
flected attention from many of the serious social problems 
of the day. Interference with individuals to save them 
from the consequences of their own ignorance was prac- 
ticed in part only. Laws affecting child labor and the 
employment of women had indeed been passed and put 
into operation. To carry the work of social education to 
the parents’ homes was still unthought of, and the ameli- 
orative program of the philanthropy of that day had not 
been succeeded by the recent insistence on preventive 
methods. 
c. Third Period. Preventive Methods. 
The third period has only recently been inaugurated. It 
is characterized by intensive methods of saving human 
life. Precedents are being broken as new policies are 
adopted. Old principles are being discarded as new ones 
are accepted. Problems of human betterment are being 
solved. The social importance of the birth of a child and 
the duty of society to grant that child an opportunity for
-P-A-G-E-27
  INFANT AND CHILD MORTALITY 21 
life and health are facts that are rapidly being recognized. 
We are living in the sunshine, not in the shadow, of a former 
age, and our present watchword is the future, not the past. 
Examples of energetic application to the task of reducing 
infant mortality are found in the recent work of Hudders- 
field, England, and Rochester, New York. About 1885 
Paris likewise began a crusade against the high death rates 
among its children. The recent rapid growth of knowledge 
about the micro-organisms that attack the human body is 
proving a tremendous aid in the solution of the question. 
The most dangerous and destructive children’s diseases 
can be almost entirely eliminated by the recently discovered 
methods of attacking germ diseases, and of all the possible 
attempts to lessen the average death rates of to-day, efforts 
directed toward the diminution of infant and child mor- 
tality promise to be rewarded with the most immediate 
and abundant success. 
It is the purpose of Book I to call attention to this serious 
problem, to point out present difficulties in the way of its 
solution, and to suggest such methods of amelioration 
as would probably prove successful. Our brief historical 
review of the progress which society has already achieved 
indicates that bed rock has not yet been reached; that 
thousands of child lives are still wantonly wasted, and that 
an efficient method of reducing infant mortality is one of 
the most urgent needs of the day.

CHAPTER II 
GENERAL ASPECTS OF THE PROBLEM 
1. Toe Waste or Lire. 
The law of natural selection has undoubtedly been a 
tremendous factor in fixing the physical and physiological 
traits of human kind. From the infancy of human exist- 
ence up to the present time it has been ceaseless in its 
operation, diminishing in intensity, however, with the 
gradually increasing control by man of the natural environ- 
ment. The waste which natural selection incurs among 
animal life is stupendous. But for the rigorous processes 
and destructiveness of nature, even the most’ slowly repro- 
ducing animals would soon overstock the earth. The 
early life of man is replete with the conditions of struggle 
and contest. The primitive races have always suffered 
from an enormous waste of lives. Every advance in civ- 
ilization, however, means a saving of human lives. Each 
- successively higher stage of human society has instituted 
additional saving processes and has witnessed a more 
economical use of nature’s bounties. Civilization implies 
an increasing utilization of our powers and of our mental 
and physical equipment as well as the most efficient use 
of the many intricate forces of nature. The more primitive 
a society, the more absolute is its subjection to the con- 
ditions of environment and the more helpless are its mem- 
bers in the face of disease and death. 
Probably in no other field of human activity has man’s 
former ignorance been more lamentable in its consequences 
22

GENERAL ASPECTS OF THE PROBLEM 23 
than in that of rearing children — the future parents of . 
the race. Even the slow increase of savage tribes is pur- 
chased at a tremendous expenditure of energy, and the 
number of infants and little children whose physical and 
economic cost is never compensated for by useful and pro- 
ductive lives has been appalling. Although decreasing 
costs of progress characterize an advancing civilization, 
nations have not until recently even begun to realize the 
costs involved in the loss of infant and child lives. 
Industrial progress has far outstripped our advance in 
standards of life and other social conditions. The utiliza- 
tion of material formerly wasted has been developed into 
a science, and in some cases the difference between profit 
and loss has been measured by this saving. The continued 
decrease of necessary cost and labor is one of the aims of 
industry. Apply this principle to the cost of propagating 
the human race, and we find that society has hardly begun 
to conserve its physical powers in economical ways. Thou- 
sands of lives are still needlessly sacrificed because of 
failure to appreciate the loss. The darkness and austerity 
-of a civilization finds no mean measure in its infant death 
rate. In this respect great progress has indeed been made, 
but it is an advance far outstripped by the progress of in- 
dustry. Much still remains to be done. Problems of 
vitality and of disease should be studied from every avail- 
able point of view, in order to determine the fundamental 
causes of conditions and to effect such changes as may be 
necessary. In Europe the subject of infant mortality is 
regarded as a social problem. Books, although written 
by physicians, have emphasized its social nature. It is 
well, therefore, for the American people to recognize every | 
phase of the question and to hold to strict accountability 
the physician who treats the disease, the economist who | 
investigates the material conditions of society, the moralist 
who studies the influence of ethics, and the sociologist who 
 
-P-A-G-E-30

24 CHILD PROBLEMS 
_ is interested in the social conditions which make for health 
and vitality. The susceptibility of the child to the handi- 
caps of his environment intensifies the social nature of the 
problem of infant mortality. 
2. Economic Cost or Cum~p Morratiry. 
Every child born into this world represents an invest- 
ment, the value of which is measured by his expectation ; 
of life at birth. MIf his expectation is low, society cannot 
hope for a heavy realization upon its outlay/ +The economic 
gain derived from his services will be smdll, and will corre- 
spond to a low rate of interest on an investment. Pro- 
ductive human lives are the assets of society, and the divi- 
dends of progress depend upon the sum total of years spent 
in useful service. The heavy economic loss resulting from 
a high infant mortality can be but vaguely expressed in 
~ figures of mortality or longevity. Nor is it possible to 
approximate the probable cost incurred in rearing the 
children who die before the age of fifteen has been reached. 
In most cases the child before this age is not a producer, 
but a consumer only, and remains an economic cost to 
society. Vast sums are expended to augment the future 
efficiency of such children. Hundreds of dollars are lav- 
ished on them, and society naturally expects some reim- 
bursement for its expenditure. Former rates of mortality 
were too excessive to make a long course of educational 
training profitable. If we pause to consider that every 
death of a child below the age of puberty means an absolute 
loss of potential capital and productive power, our imagi- 
nation slowly begins to appreciate the appalling loss to 
society that high death rates among children involve. 
The older the child, the greater the cost which he. has en- 
tailed, and the greater the loss in case of death. It has 
been estimated that among the Bontoe Igorotte of the 
Philippines, 60 per cent of all persons die before the age 
   
-P-A-G-E-31
  
GENERAL ASPECTS OF THE-PROBLEM 25 
of puberty is reached! Is it any wonder that these people 
have progressed so little? Much of their energy has been 
entirely wasted. 
Western civilization has suffered severely from its former 
inattention to problems of health and vitality. Estimates 
based on records for Geneva, Switzerland, indicate that 
the expectation of life at birth rose from twenty-one and 
one sixth years in the last half of the sixteenth century to 
forty and two thirds years in the first quarter of the nine- 
teenth. Considered from the economic point of view, the 
productivity per equal amounts of population in the latter 
period is more than four times that of the former. In the 
first period the duration of life after the beginning of the 
productive period (say fifteen years) was a little more than 
six years; in the second it had risen to twenty-five. In 
the older days, however, a much larger proportion of in- 
dividuals died in the earlier age groups; accordingly, the 
proportions just given are too harsh, and fail to do com- 
plete justice to the sixteenth century. Undoubtedly a 
comparison between the two periods as to the expectation 
of life at the age of fifteen would show a much smaller dis- 
crepancy. Nevertheless, the tremendous cost of rearing 
a productive population in the sixteenth century is only 
too evident. England, France, Germany, and the minor 
European countries all testify to the gradually increasing 
expectation of life of their inhabitants. The tables com- 
puted for Netherlands show a most remarkable degree of 
progress: In the period 1811-1825 one half of the males 
died before reaching the age of twenty-five. During the 
decade 1860-1869 forty years represented a probable life- 
time. The table by Van Pesch for 1890-1899 shows that 
the fifty-sixth year is now passed before one half of the 
males perish, although one fourth only were left at that 
age in the period 1816-1827. 
American records indicate the heavy economic loss due
-P-A-G-E-32
26 CHILD PROBLEMS 
  to unreasonable rates of mortality. In 1900 the average 
expectation of life in Massachusetts was forty-six years. 
That for the entire United States probably did not differ 
much from this. In the same year the death rates in the 
registration area of the United States indicated that 30 
per cent of all children die before reaching the age of fifteen. 
Combining these two sets of figures, we ascertain that 
nearly one third of the total number of American children 
fail to reach the third part of their expected lifetime. 
Only 70 per cent reach the productive period of life and 
begin to yield returns upon the social investment. Risk- 
ingsthe possibility of a future advantage from their ser- 
vices, society has, through their parents, provided the 
children with food, clothing, shelter, and other necessary 
means of subsistence. It has given the older children 
educational advantages and, through the agency of the 
community, has offered moral and religious instruction. 
Fortunately, five eighths of the total mortality of the chil- 
dren under fifteen falls within the first five years of life, 
when the economic cost of the child has not assumed ex- 
tensive proportions. The importance and significance of 
this economic problem has not received due recognition. 
3. PxHystotoeicaL Cost. 
Graver and more serious than the economic aspect of the 
question is the physical and physiological cost involved 
in any useless waste of life. From the economic point 
of view the investment in growing children has justified 
itself by returns more than adequate to cover the losses 
incurred by the death of the unproductive, but no one can 
measure the physical loss resulting from an unnecessary 
rate of infant mortality. The burden of motherhood is 
not lightly borne. The civilization of to-day has, in fact, 
aggravated the pain and suffering of parturition, and one of 
the problems of our current civilization is the restoration
-P-A-G-E-33
  GENERAL ASPECTS OF THE PROBLEM 27 
of our women to a physiological condition which, like that 
of the European peasant, allows comparatively easy con- 
finements. The physical life of society must be renewed 
at a constantly decreasing cost. Otherwise civilization 
is stationary. The strain upon the life-giving powers 
and vital energies must be made to yield the maximum of 
returns. In lower animal life reproduction means a decline 
in vigor, or is possibly followed by death. Reproduction 
is the Alpha and Omega of individual life, which is subor- 
dinated in importance to the life of the species. This is 
Nature’s law, not the result of conscious planning. In 
higher animal life a tax on strength and vitality continues. 
Among human beings enlightened civilization ee, 
that the rights no less than the duties of a parent generation 
must receive due consideration. The perpetuation of the 
race is not the sole task of our species. Consequently the 
load borne by mothers needs to be viewed from two stand- 
points, that of society and that of the individual, and the 
necessary course of action must be fair to both. 
An excess of births over deaths is necessary for the growth 
of society. The loss of a large percentage of children in- 
dicates an enormous and unjustifiable physiological waste. 
A lower death rate produces at a reduced cost the same 
effect as a greater fecundity. The duty of motherhood, 
on the other hand, should not be evaded, and must remain 
for all time. The necessary hardships involved must be 
borne, as all necessary pain and suffering is borne by men 
and women, who are nowhere free from physical pain. To- 
day, however, the importance of quality in human beings 
is being increasingly recognized, and the unnecessary tax 
upon our mothers resulting from an extravagant birth rate 
is a sin against which the voice of the sociologist should 
be raised. ‘ 
To the individual mother the physical cost of rearing a 
family is twofold: first, the vital energy expended in bear- 
 
-P-A-G-E-34
  28 CHILD PROBLEMS 
ing and nursing the child; and second, the “wear and tear” 
upon mothers in the care of their children. The first cost 
continues until nearly a year after the birth of the child, 
although the greatest expenditure occurs during the pre- 
natal period. While the economic cost of children increases 
with their age, this portion of the physical cost is all under- 
gone during the first year of life, and therefore an excessive 
infant mortality results in almost a complete loss of vital 
energy. The magnitude of this loss is appalling when we 
realize that out of every five or six children one dies in the 
first year of life! Has not the woman who has been the 
mother of six children, of whom only three survive to adult 
life, undergone a greater physical loss than the mother of 
three who loses none of her children? Yet the contribu- 
tion to the race is the same for each. Furthermore, the 
latter mother has been able to use the saved energy in being 
a better wife and mother and a more efficient member of 
society. Are not such birth rates as those prevailing in 
certain parts of Europe and among many classes in our own 
country brutal in their pressure upon people already loaded 
down with innumerable troubles? Without doubt the 
physical life of society can be maintained and expanded at 
a greatly reduced cost and with much better results. 
The second item of physical cost — the constant strain 
upon mothers in the care of their children — can never be 
replaced, aftd we have no right to permit its wanton waste. 
When concentrated upon a few healthy children, it is 
charged with power for their future welfare, but when this 
energy is freely dissipated among sickly, short-lived chil- 
dren, the social consequences can not be hopeful, and the 
next generation has reason to fear the effects. To guide 
and train children aright is not mere recreation, and efforts 
in this direction can not be too wisely expended. A reason- 
able increase in population is a goal of all thinkers on social 
subjects, and the small families of children that fail to re-

    GENERAL ASPECTS OF THE PROBLEM 29 
place their parents numerically and that threaten extinction 
of the race can not be condoned. On the other hand, the 
imprudent, inconsiderate, and machine-like regularity of 
increase as effected among certain classes of people, finds 
no rational justification. And if a large proportion of the 
infants are doomed to early death, an irreparable loss to 
motherhood has been incurred. 
4. Socrat Costs. 
From the social, moral, and intellectual point of view, 
the infant mortality of the ages has been a constant re- 
proach to men. Is it not true that, two centuries ago, hap- 
less mothers, full of grief and anguish at the sight of life- 
less babes, believed implicitly in a Providence whose decree 
was inexorable, who gave and who took away the tiny 
flower of love at the first sign of blossom, to test a mother’s 
faith and piety? Social neglect fettered the souls and 
minds of thousands and inflicted upon them a fatalism 
whose consequences were submissiveness and unconscious 
brutality. What an exquisite touch of love and human 
sympathy from the impassioned religionists of a former 
time who protested against the administration of an 
anesthetic to an expectant mother, because, they alleged, 
woman was irrevocably cursed to suffer, and in pain and 
sorrow to bring forth her offspring ; therefore, man had no 
right to interfere with this divine decree ! ily, such 
a morbid and barbarous fatalism has been dissipated by 
the medical advance of a hundred years and by the achieve- 
ments of men with active, throbbing human sympathies 
who have applied themselves to problems of social better- 
ment. However, the gloomy philosophy of a former day 
has not been entirely relegated to the category of aban- 
doned beliefs. It is no difficult task to-day to find the 
crushed mother of a family of eight or ten, the majority of 
whom have become the victims of social and individual

neglect, consoling herself with the thought that it is God’s 
will and she must submit. Were her knowledge wider, 
how could she explain the discriminations against her class, 
her portion of the city, or her particular locality? No 
evil can be greater than that which prevents the emanci- 
pation of the human mind. For example, a mother of 
eight children, a number of whom are physically and men- 
tally deformed, in recent conversation indicated with phil- 
osophical equanimity her intention to bear the inflictions 
which a Higher Power had placed upon her! Would that 
our own depravity and waywardness were assigned its 
proper place, and not ascribed to Him to whom we must 
answer for our shortcomings! That the moral effect of 
the social neglect of the needy can be uplifting is not con- 
ceivable. Furthermore, the social efficiency of the parents 
of dying infants has been greatly diminished, and many 
of the active, inspiriting impulses which might be contrib- 
uted have been lost. 
5. Tue Decune iw Birta Rares. 
The vital statistics of the last century present two strik- 
ing phenomena: a decreased birth rate and a decreased 
death rate. It is not certain that birth rates were high 
in the infancy of human society. On the contrary, the 
works of practically all students of primitive races indicate 
that a cl ratively low birth rate obtained among sav- 
age peoples. Evidently exorbitant birth rates belong to 
later stages — to the civilization of the present Chinese and 
to that of Europeans until within the last fifty years. The 
changing social and economic conditions of the European 
people during recent centuries have had a marked effect 
upon birth rates and upon the growth of population. As 
the power and ability of men to control the conditions of 
their environment was increasingly realized, birth rates 
lost their stability and began to decline. Coincident 
 
-P-A-G-E-37
  GENERAL ASPECTS OF THE PROBLEM 31 
with this decline there has occurred a rapid increase in 
population. An observing demographer in the early part 
of the last century summed up the situation in the follow- 
ing words: “ Population does not so much increase because 
more are born but because fewer die.’”’ Conscious efforts 
by statesmen to enhance a nation’s growth have not largely 
influenced that nation’s birth rate. Undoubtedly the 
diminished mortality of children due to increased knowl- 
edge and better methods of arresting disease has been the 
dominant factor in the rapid increase of the population 
of the world in the last one hundred and fifty years. Mer- 
ciless birth rates and abnormal death rates are being suc- 
ceeded by humane birth rates and a greatly decreased 
infant mortality. 
The records of European vital statistics tell a very sig- 
nificant story. During the decade 1831-1840, birth rates 
in Sweden, Finland, Austria, Prussia, Belgium, and France 
were higher than they were in the same countries during 
the last decade of the nineteenth century. Between these 
two periods death rates declined very largely in each one of 
the countries mentioned. The reduction has been due 
to various causes, less in general, however, to the mortality 
of small infants than to the decrease in deaths of children 
under five years of age. In both of the periods mentioned 
the birth rate in each country exceeds its death rate, but 
(the countries with the highest birth rates al ve the 
highest mortality Fyrthermore, in every case except that 
of France the nét excess of births over deaths has increased 
considerably, despite the universally lower birth rate. It 
is clear, therefore, that under ordinary conditions these 
countries are arriving at the same destination, but by means 
of “a more humane method than formerly — by paying 
increased attention to, and removing, the causes that oper- 
ate to destroy human life. 
An increase in the birth rate has not shown itself neces- 
 
-P-A-G-E-38
32 CHILD PROBLEMS 
sary for the realization of the dream of those statesmen 
who believe that national strength lies in a large aggre- 
gate of population. For example, birth rates in England, 
Sweden, and Belgium are as low as death rates in Hungary, 
Spain, and Russia. -Accordingly, if the mortality rates of 
the latter countries existed in the former, birth rates re- 
maining the same, the growth of population would defi- 
nitely cease. A stationary population in the North Euro- 
pean countries is avoided, however, by the low infantile 
mortality. Exorbitant birth rates are necessary in the 
countries of eastern Europe to overcome their enormous 
mortality and provide for an increase of population equal 
to that of the other countries mentioned. In fact, Eng- 
land’s net percentage of increase in population, measured 
by excess of births over deaths, was higher during the 
decade 1891-1900 than that of Hungary during the same 
period, although the respective birth rates were 29.9 and 
40.6 per one thousand population! There can be no ques- 
tion but that lower infantile mortality is superior to high 
birth rates as a method of national growth. 
6. PuystcaL DrGcENERACY. 
A final consideration worthy of notice is the relation of 
infant and child mortality to physical deterioration and 
to our standards of physique. To this question no definite 
answer @: yet been given, and data upon the subject 
are too inadequate for broad and definite generalizations. 
The author, however, views with impatience the callous- 
ness of men who regard with favor a considerable wastage 
of child life because it accords with their theory of the im- 
provement of the human race through the operation of the 
law of natural selection. Beneficent as results may be for 
the race of the future, this law, unmitigated and untem- 
pered by human hands and hearts, is harsh and cruel, and 
| its operation tends to debase the sensibilities of men and to  
-P-A-G-E-39
  GENERAL ASPECTS OF THE PROBLEM 33 
retard progress. Race improvement cannot be left to the 
whims of unconscious nature, and man can act less harshly 
and with equal effect by means of a process of social selec- 
tion. Instead of permitting the unfit to die, the more 
humane and economical method is that of refusing to per- 
mit the unfit to come into the world. This avoids the 
brutality of natural selection and accomplishes the same 
result. Standards of fitness must eventually be created. 
These must be positive in character and independent of 
the caprices of environment. Accordingly they can not be 
secured through the operation of natural selection. Mind, 
not matter, and reason, not instinct, must hereafter direct 
our line of progress. 
In former days absence of the physician’s command over 
life and death gave disease and contagion full sway. Man- 
kind, therefore, suffered from a long category of children’s 
diseases. Certain races and peoples have in this way pur- 
chased considerable immunity from various diseases. The 
individuals most unfit to withstand some particular disease 
were swept aside, and this long-continued process of elimi- 
nation resulted in strengthening such a people against 
further attacks of this disease. A selection of this kind 
protects against certain forms of attack only and does not 
immunize a people from other diseases. It is not clear 
that in this way a race is provided with the physical stand- 
ards best adapted to the conditions of modern life. For 
example, the susceptibility of the Negro to yellow fever 
is unquestionably less than that of the white man. This 
comparative immunity, however, does not extend to all 
diseases, and in other respects the white man enjoys a sim- 
ilar superiority. Consequently selection by disease is not 
an important cause of race vigor in this case. That is, 
immunity from disease is not the chief or only basis 
from which to judge physical standards. . Actual physical 
strength, productive capacity, and expectation of life are 
D

the criteria of fitness, but the advantages enjoyed by any 
single race are insufficient to enable it to gain a superiority 
in all these respects. 
Smallpox serves as an eloquent illustration of the fact 
that we have little to fear from the elimination of such 
diseases. How brutally selective this malignant scourge 
has been can be read in the history of its ravages among 
the savage tribes to which civilization has introduced it. 
Their proneness to the disease is due in part to their former 
isolation from the smallpox germs. The determining 
question, however, is, Has the elimination of the children 
vulnerable to this disease improved the race or people 
long subject to smallpox? It has undoubtedly lessened 
the intensity of future attacks upon the Caucasian race. 
For example, an athletic Indian of splendid physique may 
succumb, while a diminutive Englishman or American may 
escape with a slight attack only. Who then can measure 
the actual physical gain from the decimating effects of 
smallpox? There is no certainty that it has accomplished 
anything in that direction which other forces would not 
have done with equal efficiency. So with the entire army 
of germ diseases. They have been selecting for survival 
those most capable of resisting the germ, but here their 
labors cease. Being proof against germs is not an inherent 
characteristic of good physique. The two, on the contrary, 
have very loose connections! The future will endeavor 
to destroy the germ as well as to discover antidotes for the 
disease. If any deterioration should accompany these 
scientific triumphs, the remedy will consist of positive 
measures to rear a more vigorous progeny, not to eliminate 
weaklings. The most that we can hope to gain from im- 
munity against some particular germ is the strengthening 
of physique in a single particular only. Physical strength 
and bodily vigor will undergo little change. 
Although death rates may represent certain forms of 
 
-P-A-G-E-41
ee ee pe 
GENERAL ASPECTS OF THE PROBLEM 385 
physiological selection, infant mortality is hardly a method 
of such selection. It is really a measure of the depths of 
the ignorance and backwardness of a civilization. If the 
reduction in infant mortality which will follow aggressive 
social reform should occasion a positive loss in physique 
and strength, then only will it become necessary to utilize 
positive methods of selection. Meanwhile the problem 
of physical degeneracy need cause little worry. The in- 
difference and moral obtuseness consequent upon a mis- 
understood infant mortality should have no place in the 
lives of men and women. Education and opportunity 
should be provided for all. Then only have we instituted 
a proper system of social economy. 
 
-P-A-G-E-42
CHAPTER III 
MORTALITY RATES IN THE UNITED STATES 
GENERAL conditions in the United States vary widely 
from those prevailing in Western Europe, and therefore the 
problem of infantand child mortality is somewhat different. 
Until recently our population has been largely rural, but 
with the development of urban and industrial centers and 
the increase of a wage-earning class, new conditions have 
been thrust upon us. These conditions are reflected in 
the varied rates of infant mortality. 
1. Rurat vs. UrBAN Mortatiry. 
The first characteristic variation in infant death rates 
is the difference between the mortality of rural and urban 
districts. This difference, although not necessarily inhe- 
rent, will tend to persist for an indefinite length of time. 
The growth of our cities has been so rapid that they now 
contain more than one third of our entire population. A 
steadily increasing percentage of children are thus becom- 
ing subject to the higher death rates of the cities. City 
life suffers from a number of very grave and almost in- 
superable disadvantages. Unless the cities advance very 
rapidly in the reduction of their infant mortality, they 
will hardly be able to attain the low level of the rural rates. 
For a long time to come children in the city must suffer 
from a congestion of population. A pall of smoke or dust 
continually hovers over some cities and contaminates the 
air. The atmosphere is always more or less vitiated by 
impurities, and billions of injurious germs are ever ready 
to destroy human life. The city children must also endure 
the handicap of insufficient light and sunshine. The salu- 
36
-P-A-G-E-43
    MORTALITY RATES IN THE UNITED STATES 387 
brious effects of nature’s vitalizing agencies are well known, 
but the country child is their chief beneficiary. 
Danger from contagion is much more common in the 
city than in the country districts. Even the most pains- 
taking measures of quarantine and isolation will not ob- 
viate the differences. The ebb and flow of city popula- 
tions tends to perpetuate disease and to carry it from place 
to place. From these dangers the rural districts are 
almost immune. The cities likewise offer the lurking 
germs a better opportunity to hide themselves, and the 
squalor and poverty of the “other half” renders them easy 
victims of disease. Federal statistics indicate that such 
children’s diseases as diphtheria, measles, scarlet fever, 
and the diarrheal diseases are much more frequent in the 
cities than elsewhere. It has been shown that in Massa- 
chusetts measles and scarlet fever are three times as fre- 
quent in the city as in the country districts, and that in the 
United States smallpox and diphtheria are twice as prev- 
alent in urban communities. 
Another handicap which the city child must suffer is 
dependence upon an imported food supply which is subject 
to deterioration while en route to the city. Especially is 
this true of milk, from the bad effects of which thousands 
of children die every year, the immediate cause usually 
being some form of diarrheal disease. Various contagious 
diseases are sometimes traceable to an infected milk supply. 
Bad city water is a source of danger to thousands, whereas 
a single well or even a number of wells in the country will 
affect comparatively few people. Urban. life, therefore, 
is inferior to rural life in three important respects: first, 
there is an insufficiency of fresh air, of sunlight, and of 
healthful outdoor life; second, contagious diseases are 
more common and less easily suppressed ; third, the food 
and drink consumed in the city have a relatively greater 
deleterious effect.

38 CHILD PROBLEMS 
The statistical results of the differences that exist are | 
briefly indicated in the following table of mortality. The 
rates for the diseases specified show the proportion of 
deaths among 100,000 children of the two age groups — 
under one and under five.!

The above-mentioned diseases are classed as children’s 
diseases. In addition to these causes of a relatively high 
urban infant mortality may be mentioned. deaths from 
premature births, congenital debility, and similar weak- 
nesses, which in the cities exceed the rural rate by 60 per 
cent ; while deaths from convulsions are 50 per cent higher. 
The figures presenting the general death rate of children 
show that the urban mortality is more than 50 per cent 
higher for each of the two age periods than is the rural 
death rate. Our cities destroy three children for every 
two who die in the country! 
2. Necro vs. Wurre Deatu Rates. 
A second variation of rates is the difference between 
the death rates of negro and of white children. This 
1Census of 1900, Vital Statistics, Part I, pp. Ixxxiii and ff.
-P-A-G-E-45
ae eee 
MORTALITY RATES IN THE UNITED STATES 39 
difference is so wide as to make it a problem of the utmost 
gravity for the negro race. The negro possesses certain 
constitutional disqualifications on account of which he 
suffers from a uniformly high death rate in every age period 
of life. Other considerations, however, affect his vitality. 
Among.these are his poverty, ignorance, bad housing con- 
ditions, sexual excesses, and the disadvantages of city life. 
The mortality of negro infants is more than twice as high 
as that of whites, the rate for the former in 1900 having 
been 371.5 per 1000 children under one year of age. Al- 
most three eighths of all colored children of this age group 
are the victims of disease and death. In the country dis- 
tricts, however, the rate had fallen in 1900 to the more ac- 
ceptable level of 218.9 per 1000 as compared with 116 for 
the whites. Furthermore, this rate is but little higher than 
was the total infant death rate of all races in 1890. Progress 
for the negro, as he increases in intelligence, may therefore 
be confidently expected. The wide disparity between the 
urban and rural rates is evidence that his high mortality 
is not entirely dependent upon heredity, but is attributable 
in large measure to other causes. Certain Southern cities 
still show exorbitant rates of mortality for both colgred 
and white children, but invariably the former suffer more. 
Savannah in 1900 reported a death rate of 409.3 per 1000 
births of negro children, and other cities have closely 
followed this unenviable lead. 
The mortality of colored children under five is likewise 
enormous, the rate in 1900 having been 118.5 per 1000 
of population of corresponding age compared with a rate 
of 49.7 for whites. Scarlet fever and diphtheria have been 
less severe in their attacks upon the negro child than on the 
native white, but the relative fatalities from the diarrheal 
diseases have been distressingly larger, being almost double 
the already excessively high white death rate. A lower 
death rate from certain diseases clearly indicates the com- 
 
-P-A-G-E-46
i a a a a 
40 : CHILD PROBLEMS 
parative immunity of the negro race from those diseases ; 
on the other hand, higher rates do not in themselves prove 
a greater susceptibility to other diseases, because the pre- 
cise influence of inferior social conditions can not be deter- 
mined. The latter seldom favor the negro child, who, if 
he refuses to sucéumb to disease, clearly demon§tfates 
superior resisting power. 
3. DrrreReNcys AMONG CITIES. 
Our cities differ widely among themselves in regard to 
the relative healthfulness of their children. This disparity 
is only in part due to the inherent advantages of one city 
over another. Natural climatic conditions, however, lie 
at the base of the intrinsic differences that exist. A first 
group of cities, including especially those located in the 
Northwest, have an infant mortality of about 100 per 1000 
of population under one year of age —a rate which for a 
considerable time to come cannot be approximated by the 
majority of American cities. Good climate as well as a 
ine slum population partly account for this advan- 
agg Another group of cities suffers from a rate ranging 
from 150 to 180. This includes a.majority of the large 
cities of the East. But many cities in the South and 
Southwest fall within this group. A third class consists 
of the distinctively unhealthful cities, which have an infant 
death rate in excess of 200 and therefore present the most 
serious problem in respect to the saving of child lives. 
Excessive heat in summer, malarial conditions, and diffi- 
culty in obtaining good water are the chief causes of this 
excessive rate of mortality. Controllable causes, such as 
bad housing conditions, ignorance, and poor food, are ad- 
ditional causes which these cities must first overcome 
before their child mortality can be lessened. These wide 
variations in cities are brought about largely by environ- 
 
-P-A-G-E-47
    MORTALITY RATES IN THE UNITED STATES 41 
mental differences, and therefore the establishment of reme- 
dial agencies will tend to cause a convergence of rates, 
the lower limit of which will be measured by the healthful 
cities. In the majority of all instances present mortality 
rates can still be reduced to much lower figures. 
\ a 
4, DIFFERENCES BASED UPON SocrIAL AND INDUSTRIAL 
ConpiTIOoNs. . 
The difference between good and bad social and indus- 
trial conditions is roughly measured by the difference be- 
tween intelligent care and neglect of children. The infant 
mortality in our slum sections and industrial centers is 
almost invariably larger than that in the other parts of our 
cities, the conspicuous exception to this rule being the low 
mortality of Jewish children, in spite of their life in the 
slums and among almost intolerable conditions. Indus- 
trial cities are prone to develop conditions inimical to child 
life. Frequently the number of married women employed 
is so large as to affect vitally the degree of care which can 
be bestowed upon the child. The large factory towns of 
New England are conspicuous examples. A considerable 
foreign population has entered the manufacturing establish- 
ments there, women are employed in large numbers in the 
mills, and consequently many children are neglected. In 
Massachusetts the infant mortality of the industrial cen- 
ters where tenement houses are common, as in Fall River, 
is more than twice as large as that of the residential towns. 
Cities in which mixed conditions prevail show a propor- 
tionate mortality, the rates declining as residential features 
gain in comparative importance. Cholera infantum has 
been shown to have a direct relation to the number of 
married women employed away from home. The number 
of deaths from the diarrheal diseases in the industrial sec- 
tions is appalling and must be definitely attributed to the
-P-A-G-E-48
  42 CHILD PROBLEMS 
gross neglect of the children by their hard-working parents. 
The misery of the slum is a well-known fact. The poor 
districts of a city suffer from the excessive infant mortality 
imposed upon them by their surroundings. In Chicago, 
for instance, the Stockyards section is hopelessly inferior 
to a residence section such as Hyde Park. Milwaukee 
also clearly illustrates this aspect of the problem. Two 
specified wards of the city each contain a characteristic 
population, the one is a slum, the other an aristocratic 
section. The total population of the two is almost equal, 
but in the one the birth rate is 59 per cent higher than in 
the other. When relative death rates among infants are 
compared, the first ward exceeds the other by nearly 250 
per cent! The disproportion for children between one and 
five years of age is still greater. The slum ward, therefore, 
in spite of its high birth rate, is unable to increase its popu- 
lation as rapidly as does the aristocratic ward. 
The laboring classes suffer from a much higher infant 
mortality than do the salaried and professional classes.’ 
Some years ago Wolf presented statistics for Erfurt, Ger- 
many, which indicated that 505 out of every 1000 infants 
died among the working classes; that the relative mor- 
tality among the middle classes was 173; that among the 
rich it was only 89. The principal cause of this lower rate 
among the wealthy was their greater capacity to care for 
their children in the right way. In the United States, how- 
ever, differences are less accentuated. Nevertheless the 
conditions of environment can be made uniformly superior 
for the child of wealthy parents; the housing is better, the 
food is more adaptable, a physician is always procurable, 
detailed care can be given, and disease can be more suc- 
cessfully combated. The proportion of wealthy children 
dying from measles and summer complaint is comparatively 
small. The higher mortality among the children of the 
1See Spargo, The Bitter Cry of the Children, p. 7.
-P-A-G-E-49
ae 
MORTALITY RATES IN THE UNITED STATES 43 
working classes is due to the absence of these advantages. 
Even where women are not compelled to work away from 
home, other handicaps often exist. But when the mother 
must enter the gainful occupations, the situation is well- 
nigh hopeless. In several European countries the agricul- 
tural districts suffer from very high infant death rates, 
which are mainly due to the enforced absence of the mother 
from the home. Home conditions must suffer when the 
mother is compelled to spend her-time in the fields. 
5. ReasonaBie Rates or Morratiry. 
The gravity of the problem in the United States is meas- 
ured by the difference between the actual and a reasonable 
infant mortality. Social progress demands that the rate be 
reduced to the lowest minimum consistent with the physi- 
cal welfare of the people. There is a limit below which 
the reduction of infant mortality would only result in an 
increase of the death rate throughout the childhood period, 
or in the preservation to adult years of men and women 
doomed to early death on account of constitutional weak- 
nesses. The saving of weaklings may be of doubtful bene- 
fit to society, yet social progress should be possible without 
the sacrifice of child lives. The present problem consists 
in reducing the infant mortality to the lowest point which 
enlightened civilization can accomplish. The reasonable 
bed rock is far from present attainment. Experiments in 
limited areas where exceptional care could be given to chil- 
dren have resulted in remarkable reductions of the infant 
mortality. Because such experiments are necessarily local, 
the death rates which are attained represent a figure lower 
than the average to which general rates can be reduced for 
a considerable time to come. A mortality of 100 per 1000 
under one year is, however, a goal which all large cities 
should set for themselves, and the better situated cities of 
 
-P-A-G-E-50
III ED LEE 
44 CHILD PROBLEMS 
the West should establish a still lower level as a standard. 
Conditions should not require the loss of more than one 
out of every ten infants during the first year of life. A 
mortality of 10 per cent may be regarded as reasonable 
for the larger cities of to-day. In the smaller towns and 
in the rural districts, where there is less poverty and where 
a greater salubrity prevails, infant death rates ought to be 
less than 8 per cent. These limits should not be considered 
as permanent ones, as a much lower rate can be realized 
before society will suffer physically from this cause. When 
the rates mentioned have been reached, enough general 
progress will have been made to justify the establishment 
of still lower limits. The gradual change in the environ- 
ment and the better care of infants are important factors, 
the influence of which will then determine the newly attain- 
able level of infant mortality. 
6. Generat Rates IN THE Unitep Srartus.! 
In order to show how far the United States falls short 
of reasonable rates of infant and child mortality the follow- 
ing statistics are presented : * — 
1 The infant and child mortality of any district may be indicated in 
two ways:— 
First, the total mortality per 1000 children of a given age may be 
specified. This method of comparison permits an exact determination of 
the proportion of loss, provided that accurate birth statistics are at hand. 
The aggregate shrinkage is the more important question, and therefore 
this method is the correct one to use in comparing the net gain and loss 
to child life both as to time and to space. Standard death rates are 
important as an index to general social conditions. 
Second, the relation of infant mortality to total mortality may be 
considered. The smaller the proportion of the former the more favor- 
able are the conditions of environment. As child life is more susceptible 
to disease than is the adult, a relative decline in infant mortality is a 
favorable indication. This method of computation, however, only re- 
lates the comparative death rate of one period to that of another and 
does not show the changes in the level of the death rates themselves.

A most significant change has occurred since 1890. In 
that year the mortality of infants was 205.8. During the 
following decade there occurred a decline of about 20 per 
cent. The rates for children under five fell from 66.8 in 
1890 to 52.1 in 1900, and, while in the former year 389 out 
of every 1000 children died before reaching the fifteenth 
year of life, in 1900 the number had fallen to 303, thus 
insuring a noteworthy increase in the number of persons 
surviving to an age of economic usefulness. This decline 
has not been general, and many localities have failed to 
participate in the gain. Massachusetts reported a higher 
infant mortality in 1900 than during the decade which 
included the Civil War, but its rates for children under 
five had slightly decreased. Since 1900 considerable prog- 
ress has been made. The development of urban and in- 
dustrial conditions, however, has been a prime factor in the 
failure of many cities to lower their rates. Providence, 
Rhode Island, increased its infant mortality from 122 per 
1000 births in the period 1856-1860 to 158 in the period 
1901-1905, and this has occurred in spite of many efforts 
to check the increasing death rate.

This table indicates that a substantial reduction in the 
proportion of child mortality has taken place even in the 
large cities, but it is also apparent that the decrease is more 
marked for children under five than for infants —a fact 
which proves that the health problems of the latter have 
not yet received sufficient attention, for we now know that 
this mortality can be decreased. Throughout the period 
covered in the above table general death rates have de- 
creased; accordingly any decline in the proportionate mor- 
tality of children represents a considerable gain. The 
most remarkable instance of American success in reducing 
infant mortality rates is furnished by the city of Rochester, 
New York. An account of this work is given in a subse- 
quent chapter. 
7. ESTIMATE OF PREVENTABLE DEATHS. 
‘In 1900 the number of deaths of children under five years 
of age in the United States was 317,532, or 30.5 per cent
-P-A-G-E-53
Te ee ee ee Ce ee 
MORTALITY RATES IN THE UNITED STATES 47 
of all deaths. The total deaths under one were 199,325, 
or 19 per cent of the mortality at all ages. In 1905 the 
registration area showed an aggregate of deaths almost 
identical with its record of 1900. The more satisfactory 
records of 1908 show that 189,865 children under five years 
of age died in that year in the registration area. If similar 
proportions were maintained throughout the United States, 
the loss to the country must have been more than 366,000 
children, of whom over 100,000 were above one year but 
less than five. These children were therefore beyond the 
age when constitutional diseases destroy them, and had 
successfully passed through the period when the weak 
and unfit are eliminated. The death of these children is 
an evidence of the gravest social neglect.’ 
If the rate of infant mortality in the rural districts of the 
registration area in 1900 had been general throughout this 
area, the number of deaths would have fallen from 102,220 
to about 72,300, or a gain of nearly 30,000 infants, while 
the gain for the entire United States would have reached 
a total of 59,000. For children under five the rural rate 
was one third less than the general rate, and its application 
to the entire country would result in a constructive saving 
of 105,000 lives to the United States every year. The 
births during the census year of 1900 were 2,063,386 infants, 
1 Professor Irving Fisher of Yale University has computed the fol- 
lowing ratio of preventability of deaths from certain diseases in which 
the median age at death is under five. Premature birth, 40 per cent; 
congenital debility, 40; diarrhea and enteritis, 60; measles, 40; broncho- 
pneumonia, 50; whooping cough, 40; meningitis, 70; diphtheria, 70; 
croup, 75. He concludes that of all diseases in which the median age 
is one year the percentage of preventability is 47 and of other diseases 
of childhood is 67. Applied to our present infant and child mortality 
these percentages would result in a saving of about 200,000 children 
to the United States every year. 
See Bulletin of the Committee of One Hundred on National Health. 
Report on National Vitality, its Waste and Conservation, by Professor 
Irving Fisher.

  48 CHILD PROBLEMS 
and the saving would be equivalent to a change of 5 per 
cent in the birth rate. Even the rural death rates are un- 
reasonably high, so the total saving of lives measured by 
a fair standard should be considerably more. At least 
40 per cent of the infant mortality, and a still larger pro- 
portion of the deaths under five years of age should be re- 
garded as unnecessary and therefore strictly preventable. 
Positive means should immediately be enacted to eliminate 
this useless and costly waste of human life and of physical 
and social energy. The net saving which would result 
from such a decrease of mortality would approximate 
150,000 child lives annually. Surely this constitutes one 
of the gravest child problems of the day.

CHILDREN’S DISEASES 
1. Sprcrric Diszaszs. 
Children are particularly susceptible to certain diseases, 
and therefore the average age at death of persons dying 
from these diseases is comparatively low. The term 
“children’s diseases” may therefore be properly applied 
to a number of such affections, of which the following are 
the principal ones : —

Smallpox, as the table shows, is no longer a.disease of 
childhood, but has been included because it formerly ranked 
assuch. The change is not due to the nature of the disease 
but to the splendid achievements of medical science, which 
EB 49

has almost exterminated it. Vaccination has rendered 
the child comparatively immune, and adults now suffer as 
frequently as do the children. Medicine will, it is hoped, 
accomplish equally successful results for the other diseases 
of childhood. 
a. Diphtheria. 
This disease has been the terror of childhood since the 
virtual elimination of smallpox. It is an extremely 
malignant disease, and the case fatality has reflected its 
persistent virulence. The remarkable change, however, 
which medicine has accomplished since 1890 is shown by 
the following table of case fatalities,

In every large city significant changes in favor of lower 
rates have occurred since 1895, when the use of antitoxin 
was introduced. Formerly the case fatality from diph- 
»\ theria was uniformly high, having reached a maximum 
of 74 per cent in Baltimore in 1894. The change since 
1895 has been permanent and decisive, and has robbed the 
disease of its ancient terrors. During the decade 1897- 
1906 the case fatality in Chicago from cases treated with 
antitoxin by the bureau of health was only 6.5 per cent.

CHILDREN’S DISEASES 51 
The experience of this city also illustrates the advantage 
of early treatment of the disease. The results from the 
treatment of 8372 cases during the period given above 
show that if the administration of antitoxin occurred on 
the first day of the disease the rate of mortality was .32 
per cent; if on the second day, 1.51 per cent; if on the 
third day, 3.38 per cent ; if on the fourth, 11.15 per cent ; 
but if antitoxin was not used until a later day, the rate rose 
to 22.01 per cent.!. Furthermore, during this period more 
than 9000 persons who had been exposed to the disease 
were treated with immunizing doses of antitoxin, and of 
these persons only 51 afterwards contracted the disease, 
all of whom subsequently recovered. The scourge of 
diphtheria now rests lightly upon the child. 
The steps taken to save the children from this disease 
are the following : — 
First, the establishment of a rigid quarantine, and in 
the larger cities of medical inspection in the scjggels by 
means of which many incipient cases of diphtheria’ dis- 
covered. The rates of morbidity are therefore consid- 
erably decreased. 
Second, a bacteriological diagnosis of the case. New 
York City began this in the year 1892, and accomplished 
good results through the exercise of this precaution. 
Third, the extensive use of antitoxin. This has saved 
thousands of lives. The effectiveness of the virus is evi- 
dent from the work done in the tenement house districts 
of New York City, where the case fatality in 1903 among 
the poor who were treated free of charge by the health 
officials was only 5.7 per cent, as compared with an average 
of 10.5 per cent for the entire city. The existence of this 
remedy has lessened the tendency of many parents to con- 
ceal the fact that some of their children were suffering from 
the disease. The serum is still rather costly, and the poor 
1 Report of the Department of Health, Chicago, 1906, p. 129. 
 
-P-A-G-E-58
  52 CHILD PROBLEMS 
are unable to pay for its use, but all of the large cities have 
liberally provided for the free distribution of antitoxin 
to those unable to engage theservices of a physician directly, 
and private charity has provided adequate hospital room. 
Accordingly no one need forego the enlightened treatment 
which present day advancement affords. Undue caution, 
however, frequently results in a tardy diagnosis, with con- 
sequent disaster to the child. 
Fourth, the tracing of the contagion to the place of origin 
and ascertaining its communicating medium. Bad milk, 
sweat-shop goods, unclean food, and other agencies which 
earry the disease are being more carefully inspected than 
formerly. In many cities pasteurization has acted as a 
deterrent. In the city of Washington, the prevalence of 
diphtheria has declined, owing largely to this method of 
caring for milk. Pure food laws and inspection of goods 
made in tenements have also attacked the disease at its 
sourcegsgand decreased the danger of contagion. 
Cl ‘ic and racial conditions influence the prevalence 
of diphtheria. It is a winter disease, and comparatively 
low rates of mortality prevail during the summer months. 
The negro child enjoys a somewhat greater immunity from 
the disease than does the white child. Owing to these 
differences, the children of the South suffer less from this 
ailment than do children in the remainder of the United 
States. In European countries rates do not differ mate- 
rially from the ones prevailing here, and the use of anti- 
toxin is working similar results. 
b. Measles and Scarlet Fever. 
Although less dangerous than diphtheria, measles and 
scarlet fever are extremely contagious. . Science has as yet 
discovered no specific for them, and victims must rely upon 
the_old methods of treatment. The case fatality is less, 
but the net mortality greater, from measles than from 
scarlet fever. The former is especially fatal during the  
-P-A-G-E-59
  CHILDREN’S DISEASES 53 
second year of life, while a greater percentage of fatalities 
occurs from scarlet fever during the third and fourth years. 
The first.four months of the year are most fatal for this 
disease, while the greatest mortality from measles occurs 
from February to May. The number of cases of the latter 
disease fluctuates widely from year to year, with a general 
downward tendency. In New York City waves of inci- 
dence seem to appear every second year. Since the disease 
has been quarantined and the use of fumigation employed, 
a favorable decline has occurred. Cities still suffer dis- 
proportionately, and far exceed the rural districts in their 
fatalities. The disease could be more effectively checked 
but for the attitude of many mothers, who regard measles 
as an unavoidable disease and who permit their children 
to be exposed to it. Wage-carning mothers frequently hide 
the fact from the health officials, and so evade quarantine. 
Scarlet fever is practically unknown in those countries, 
such as Japan, that do not use cow’s milk as fogal; it is 
therefore probable that a’ close relation exists bet’ the 
use of the milk and the disease. The elimination of the 
disease consequently depends largely upon the purification 
of the milk supply. An epidemic has on several occasions 
been traced to a dairy farm where victims of the fever 
have infected the milk. Buffalo, Chicago, and other cities 
have endeavored to prevent the disease by attempting to 
discover its source. The scarlet fever germ will lie dor- 
mant for years and then infect through contact with the 
individual. More easily than any other malignant disease 
can it be carried about by old or exposed clothes, and pre- 
cautionary methods are therefore very necessary. The 
poor and constitutionally weak are more prone to succumb 
to this disease than the strong and well-fed, since the former 
have less vital power of resistance. Better nutrition, 
sufficient food, and more adequate care of the young are 
needed to resist attacks of the fever.

54 CHILD PROBLEMS 
c. Whooping Cough and Bronchitis. . 
Whooping cough is decidedly a disease of infancy. More 
than one half of the deaths from this disease occur during 
the first year of life, and very few after the fifth year. The 
rural rates are but little lower than those of the cities, but 
the American mortality from this cause is hardly one half 
that of England or Germany. Epidemics in our cities, 
however, sometimes continue for several years and occasion 
a heavy mortality, although the disease is not commonly 
considered dangerous. Whooping cough is most common 
during the summer and autumn months. 
Bronchitis is a disease of childhood as well as of old age. 
About one third of all deaths from this cause occur during 
the first year of life; one half take place in the first five- 
year period, and nearly all of the remainder occur after the 
forty-fifth year. Here again the rural districts show 
lower rates than do the cities, but the difference is not a 
mae The total death rates from either bronchitis 
or pn onia are much higher than the rates for measles, 
scarlet fever, or whooping cough. The winter months 
are especially favorable to a high mortality from these 
respiratory diseases. Ignorance, exposure, and lack of 
care are fruitful causes of the heavy death rate which 
they occasion. 
d. Diseases of the Digestive System. 
The most deadly of all diseases of infancy and childhood 
are the various forms of acute intestinal diseases, including 
diarrhea and enteritis, cholera infantum being classed under 
enteritis. The problem of infant mortality has received 
but little attention in those cities in which no decline in 
the death rates from these diseases has been recorded. 
Effective work in saving child lives is largely measured by 
the success attained in decreasing the mortality from the 
diseases of the digestive system. Success in this respect 
indicates a high-water mark in the history of preventive

More than 40,000 children die annually in the registra- 
tion area from these diseases, and the aggregate mortality 
for the United States approximates about twice this num- 
ber, or three times the number of deaths from diphtheria 
and croup. About four fifths of these deaths, however, 
occur during the first year of life. The urban rate ranges 
from 334 to 50 per cent higher than the rural rate, and the 
industrial cities show a distinctively heavy mortality. In 
recent years the rate throughout the registration area has 
fluctuated but slightly, the year 1905 marking a high point, 
and 1908 showing asmall decline. Many individual cities 
have, on the other hand, successfully reduced their mor- 
tality from the intestinal diseases. Among cities having 
a population of more than 100,000, Fall River, Massachu- 
setts, reported the highest rate in 1908, its mortality being 
880.1 per 100,000 of population, or nearly three times the 
1U.S. Bureau of Census. Mortality Statistics, 1900-1904, 1905, 1908. 
Although the above table represents death rates on the basis of the 
population at all ages, 85 per cent of the deaths occur among children 
under two years of age.

average rate for the registration cities. 
industrial conditions are largely responsible for this fact. 
In manufacturing cities the rates tend to remain stationary, 
although several exceptions occur. Local social and 
Several large cities 
have, however, in spite of the difficulties attending the 
work, succeeded in reducing the mortality from the diar- 
New York City (old) annually contributes 
between three and four thousand children under five years 
of age to the mortality from this group of diseases. Still 
the absolute number of deaths has remained almost sta- 
tionary, and the rate has decreased considerably since 1895, 
when a decided fall in the mortality from this source took 
place. Chicago has shown a decline in the following re- 
spects: the rate of mortality from these diseases, the total 
number of such deaths, and the proportion of all mortality 
due to these causes. 
The distribution of these diseases throughout the differ- 
ent months of the year is most significant. In no other case 
does th@ death rate vary so heavily from season to season. 
The predominating influence of weather conditions as a 
cause of the violent fluctuations in rates is therefore at

based on the mortality in the registration area of the United 
States during the years 1900-1904." 
This table shows that during the winter and spring 
months the mortality is very low, and that few or no epi- 
demics of these diseases exist. On the other hand, the three 
months of July, August, and September witness more than 
three fifths of the entire number of deaths. The first two 
are the hottest months of the year, and a clear relation 
between heat and the prevalence of the diarrheal diseases 
is thus indicated. The heat, however, acts indirectly by 
hastening the growth of harmful bacteria in the milk, and 
these in turn cause disease. No other phase of infant mor- 
tality offers so large a field for the work of the physician 
and the philanthropist. 
e. Prematurity. 
A large group of children die annually from the diseases 
of early infancy. Premature birth and congenital debility 
fall within this group. Thirty-two thousand two hundred 
and seventy-four infants died from this class of diseases 
in the registration area in 1908. If the same rate of mor- 
tality prevailed throughout the United States, the total 
deaths would exceed 62,000. That this large mortality 
does not entirely depend on purely hereditary causes is 
proven by the wide differences existing between urban and 
rural rates, the latter being only 73 per cent of the former. 
The death rate in the United States is a fluctuating one, 
and shows no pronounced tendency either upward or down- 
ward. In England, on the other hand, the death rate from 
this source is not only higher than here, but the rate has 
been increasing and is a cause of grave concern to the Eng- 
lish people. 
f. Convulsions and Meningitis. 
Convulsions are specially fatal toinfants and are annually 
responsible for about 7000 to 8000 deaths in the registra- 
1U.S. Bureau of Census, Mortality Statistics, 1900-1904.

tion area, and of probably 15,000 throughout the entire 
country. Although classified among the diseases of the 
nervous system, ‘‘convulsions” is a loose and indefinite 
term. The symptoms are often remotely connected with 
the diseases of the digestive system. Another ailment 
which is especially fatal to children is meningitis. This 
disease destroys nearly as many persons under five years 
of age as do convulsions. Unlike the latter, meningitis 
shows a fluctuating rate, and science has not yet been able 
to strike at the root of the disease. (

  CHILDREN’S DISEASES 59 
for about two thirds of the deaths of children under five. 
The first group includes most of the cases of children 
afflicted with constitutional weaknesses or with acquired 
atrophied conditions. The prevention of this mortality 
is most difficult, and will require extensive social changes. 
The diarrheal diseases cause about one fourth of the mor- 
tality of infants and small children in the United States. 
The figures for England do not include gastritis, which, 
if added, as in the American tables, would raise the mor- 
tality from this group of diseases to about 20 per cent. 
This heavy mortality is largely preventable, and practi- 
cable measures for solving the problem have been adopted 
in a number of cities. Convulsions are twice as common 
in England as they are in the United States. The chief 
respiratory diseases claim from one seventh to one sixth 
of the infant mortality. Exposure is the principal cause of 
this high rate. It will be noticed that the contagious dis- 
eases form a comparatively inconspicuous part of the 
infant mortality of to-day. The entire group of such 
diseases, as well as all others, are classed under “all other 
causes,”’ yet this entire group contributes only one fourth 
of the total death rate and little more than the American 
death rate for diseases of the digestive system. Both in- 
dividual and social conditions are at fault, and a marked 
reduction of the mortality of children can not occur with- 
out considerable reform. Increased interference with the 
parental control of children and with the social causes of 
disease is necessary.

CHAPTER V 
ULTIMATE CAUSES OF INFANT MORTALITY 
1. Principat CavszEs. 
More fundamental than the immediate causes of the 
death rate quoted in the foregoing chapter are the ultimate 
factors which are responsible for the fatal diseases of child- 
hood. The art of medicine deals with specific diseases, 
but social workers are more directly concerned with the 
prevention of the particular ailments than with their medi- 
cal treatment. Dr. Farr, the eminent English vital statis- 
tician, concluded that the conditions in respect to food, 
water, cleanliness, malnutrition, and midwifery were the 
principal causes of the unnecessary infant mortality in 
England. This was fifty years ago, however. Arthur 
Newsholme in 1899 gave the following classification of 
causes : — 
1. Premature Birth and Congenital Defects. 
2. Hereditary Tendencies. (Inheritance of  siphilis, 
drunkenness, etc.) 
3. Inexperience and Neglect of Mothers. 
4. Industrial Conditions. (Women working during and 
after pregnancy.) 
5. Social Conditions. 
6. Improper Food. 5 
7. Deaths from Accidental or Homicidal Violence. 
George Newman regards the ante-natal influence as a 
most prominent cause of infant mortality in England. 
Among the important factors he includes the ili effects of 
60 
 
-P-A-G-E-67
  ULTIMATE CAUSES OF INFANT MORTALITY 61 
poisoning caused by the work of mothers in certain dan- 
gerous trades, the action of alcohol upon fcetal life, poor 
_ physiqueand ill health in the mother, previous miscarriages, 
poverty and insufficiency of food, and overwork by the 
mother. Among the post-natal causes are: the occupa- 
tion of mothers who leave their children at home without 
providing them with proper care; the prevalence of city 
life; poor housing ; bad social conditions ; artificial feed- 
“ing of infants; the use of contaminated milk; and igno- 
rance and carelessness on the part of mothers. This 
ignorance manifests itself in the methods of feeding, in 
uncleanliness, in exposure, in drunkenness, and in indif- 
ference to parental obligations. To poverty as a cause 
Newman does not attach much weight. 
2. CLASSIFICATION OF CAUSES. 
The underlying’ causes with special reference to the 
TJnited States may be conveniently classified as follows : — 
I. Improper Feeding : 
1. Artificial feeding. 
2. Use of indigestible foods. 
3. Use of bad milk. 
II. Underfeeding. 
1. Caused by ignorance of mother. 
2. Caused by failure of natural food supply. 
3. Caused by poverty of parents. - 
III. Unsanitary Conditions. 
1. Bad housing conditions, such as insufficient light 
: and air. 
2. Overcrowding. 
3. Filthy homes. 
4. Absence of needed sanitary arrangements, e.g., 
sewage systems. 
5. Germ-laden water. 
6. Lack of park area.

The exact weight of each of these causes cannot be de- 
termined, nor is it possible to isolate any of the factors, but 
the comparative importance of some of them can at least 
be approximated. Among the most important causes are : 
improper feeding, ignorance of parents, and insanitary 
conditions. 
3. Usn or Arrirician Foops. 
Naturv has provided a most satisfactory way of feeding 
the infant, but civilization has recently begun to substitute 
other methods. So far the substitutions have not been 
 
-P-A-G-E-69
    ULTIMATE CAUSES OF INFANT MORTALITY 6: 
generally successful, although there is no inherent reason 
why they may not be eventually so perfected that efficient 
results will follow. Many mothers now feed their babies 
on cow’s milk, and have discontinued breast feeding. This 
is probably true of a majority of the wealthy classes and 
of a large minority of the poor. If ordinary raw dairy 
milk is used, the result is frequently disastrous to the child. 
The effects of milk substitutes are on the other hand still 
more fatal, and both classes of food may be heavily laden 
with disease and death. Tests made in European coun- 
tries have revealed the fact that breast feeding yields the 
lowest infant mortality, that the use of animal milk causes 
a larger death rate, and that the milk substitutes are re- 
sponsible for the highest rates. 
Animal milk, in order to become an adequate substitute 
for the natural milk of the babe, must be modified, because 
the normal ingredients of the two differ in their proportions, 
and the animal milk is not naturally adapted to the infant, 
If therefore the use of such milk is to increase, its modifica- _ 
tion will be necessary in the case of thousands of infants 
in order to prevent their becoming victims of disease. 
Many children are able to thrive on undiluted cow’s milk, 
but it is precisely because large numbers are incapable of 
adapting themselves to this unnatural diet that diseases 
of the digestive system attack and destroy them. Breast 
milk changes in constituency, varying with the age of the 
child — an accommodation which has been worked out 
by nature for the advantage of the babe. Animal milk 
does not vary in its constituency to meet the changing 
needs of the infant, and consequently is an inferior and un- 
satisfactory food. The proper modification of animal 
food requires various mixtures, each adapted to a specific 
age period of the infant. At least three or four different 
modifications are needed during the first six months of life.

of New York City to test the relative merits of the different 
kinds of milk used for infants resulted in the following 
statistics. The tests covered four kinds of milk, families 
using such milk being selected for observation. A study 
was made of 400 families divided into four equal groups, 
each of which used a different grade of milk. The results 
secured are given in the subjoined table.

The store milk was sold from the open cans, and was 
therefore subject to rapid deterioration and multiplication 
of bacteria. It yielded the worst results, with the ex- 
ception of the condensed milk, which is not adapted to the 
small child and which can not, from its very nature, be 
expected to be successful. Bottled milk proved slightly 
more favorable, but the pasteurized and specially prepared 
milk alone showed a high percentage of good results. The 
difference between the last grade and the rest is sufficiently 
striking to illustrate the necessity of constant attention 
to the character of food given to the infant. 
The investigation made in 1907 by the summer corps 
of inspectors and nurses of the New York City Department 
of Health yielded the following very interesting conclusions 
in relation to the results of feeding children with various 
kinds of milk: of the total number of children under nine 
months of age, 81.15 per cent were being breast-fed, and 
only 18.85 per cent received cow’s milk or other forms of
-P-A-G-E-71
ULTIMATE CAUSES OF INFANT MORTALITY 65 
artificial food. The latter group of children, however, 
furnished 57.53 per cent of all cases of diarrhea, while the 
former group, comprising more than four fifths of all the 
children investigated, supplied less than one half (42.47 
per cent, of the cases. Of the children under nine months 
of age who died of diarrheal diseases, 25.04 per cent had 
been breast-fed, while 74.96 per cent had been artificially 
fed. The proportions for children over nine months were 
almost similar, being 23.72 and 76.28 per cent respectively. 
Accordingly, three fourths of the deaths from these dis- 
eases were furnished by a group containing less than one 
fifth of the total number of children. The superiority of 
mother’s milk and the bad effects under ordinary conditions 
of the various forms of artificial foods are thus clearly 
demonstrated.’ 
The first step advocated by many physicians is the re- 
turn to breast feeding wherever that is possible, because 
a pure clean food is thereby assured. In an increasing 
number of cases, however, this seems impossible, and the 
market supply of milk must be improved in order to insure 
the health of the babies and small children. The milk 
supply of our cities, however, receives but little attention 
because its importance has not yet been appreciated. 
4. Heat anp Necuect as ContrisutTory CausEs. 
The principal specific result of the use of bad milk is the 
occurrence of diseases of the digestive system, and these, 
as has already been shown, are the most important group 
of causes of infant and child mortality. The special in- 
cidence of a high death rate during the hot summer months 
depends partly upon the effect of the heat upon the milk, 
which deteriorates and develops harmful bacteria in a very 
short time. Accordingly, the child suffers relatively more 
in summer from the use of milk originally as good and as

carefully handled as the milk which is supplied during the 
winter months. The effect of heat, it must be observed, 
is indirect ; bad milk is the immediate cause of the intes- 
tinal disorders. The heat, however, aggravates these 
diseases, and the ignorance of parents in regard to the 
proper care of children under these conditions contributes 
further to the gravity of the problem. Ignorance and 
neglect are believed to be three times as fatal as the hot 
weather ! 
5. Bap Hovustna ConpiTIons. 
Coupled with the questions of bad milk, ignorance of 
parents, and neglect of children, are the frequent disrepu- 
table housing conditions of the poor, whereby insuffi- 
cient light, fresh air, sunshine, and good water are procured. 
The probability of a sick child’s survival is thus greatly 
lessened. 
Remedial measures must be applied to the entire gamut 
of social causes of child mortality, although the factors 
which have just been indicated should receive the most 
attention.

  CHAPTER VI 
THE MILK PROBLEM 
1. Tae Mix Factor. 
The importance of the milk question is evident from the 
attitude of the health boards of the various cities. The 
New York City Health Department has given the follow- 
ing reasons for the decrease of 62 per cent in infant mor- 
tality from 1881 to 1903 : — 
a. Purer milk secured through increased official watch- . 
fulness. 
b. Pasteurization of milk by private philanthropies. 
c. Education of mothers and nurses in regard to food, 
especially to milk. 
d. The opening of small parks. 
e. Cleaner streets. 
f. The floating hospital of St. John’s Guild. 
Three of these measures of relief are connected with the 
problem of good milk, and special emphasis is placed upon 
them by the department because they have been the chief 
factors in causing the reduction of the mortality. Health 
boards everywhere are beginning to solve the question 
by undertaking to supply either pure or pasteurized 
milk for the small children. The nature of the prob- 
lem varies from city to city, and therefore the methods 
used can not be identical. Local conditions determine 
whether a city shall demand pure milk or be content 
with pasteurization.

2. Requisirgs or Goop Minx. 
Specialists now demand that all milk meet two require- 
ments: cleanliness and proper temperature.!' The former 
is the supreme need, as without cleanliness the develop- 
ment of bacteria can not be prevented. The principal 
considerations upon which clean milk depends are the fol- 
lowing: cows must be in good condition and incapable of 
responding to the tuberculin test; dairymen and all per- 
sons handling the milk must be free from contagious dis- 
eases and must carry on their work with sufficient care to 
reduce to a minimum the amount of dirt and foreign par- 
ticles in the milk; the premises as well as the cows must 
be kept clean to protect the milk from contamination ; 
cans, bottles, and all vessels containing milk need adequate 
sterilization because dirty utensils are a source of danger, 
as the bacteria lodge in the uneven surfaces of the vessels 
and speedily multiply in the milk; depots must maintain 
sanitary conditions to prevent the infection of milk; 
finally, the consumer must know the essential conditions 
under which milk will deteriorate and become dangerous 
food for small children. 
Proper temperature is the next essential, because it is 
only by rapid cooling that the deterioration of milk can be 
retarded. There are three stages in the handling of milk : 
first, it is cooled at the dairy, where its temperature should 
be immediately reduced to not more than 50 degrees 
Fahrenheit and then kept at or below this figure ; second, 
it is subject to the churning process of transportation, at 
first by wagon, then by rail, and finally by wagon delivery 
again; third, it is kept and sold by the retailer. During 
the second stage it must be kept at a temperature not ex- 
ceeding 45 degrees. The influence of changing temperature

upon the quality of milk is demonstrated by experiments 
conducted in the city of Chicago. A sample of fresh milk, 
containing 11,500 bacteria per cubic centimeter, was 
divided into two equal parts labeled “A” and “B.” “A” 
was cooled at the dairy, but only after being loaded for 
shipment. ‘“B” was immediately cooled, then iced and 
in a condition of refrigeration was sent to the city. Both 
samples were delivered to dealers, and the milk was twenty- 
four hours old when it reached the customer. The ex- 
aminations showed the following results :1—

The first set of results clearly shows that reasonably clean 
milk, if properly iced at once, then kept cool while in transit 
and in the dealer’s hands, will yield a sufficiently low 
bacterial count to render its use entirely innocuous, while 
a failure to observe these precautions, especially if imme- 
diate cooling is neglected, will occasion a rapid multiplica- 
tion of bacteria and render the milk unwholesome. Bulk 
and bottled milk as sold in this city was found to contain 
as many as 18,000,000 bacteria per cubic centimeter. The 
second experiment, the results of which are given in the 
1 Report of Department of Health of Chicago, 1906, p. 15.
-P-A-G-E-76
  70 CHILD PROBLEMS 
last column of the table, represents the average of five 
tests of milk properly handled and kept. It is clearly 
demonstrated that clean production and proper handling 
will prevent the rapid growth of bacteria and lessen the 
danger of disease resulting from the presence and develop- 
ment of bad germs in the milk. Both cleanliness and a low 
temperature including immediate cooling are, however, 
shown to be absolutely necessary to secure suitable mil 
for babies. i 
3. PASTEURIZATION vs. STERILIZATION. 
The relative merits of these two methods of providing 
the child with suitable milk depend largely upon the local 
problem in each city. Both methods have earnest de- 
fenders as well as capable enemies. Theoretically, sterili- 
zation of utensils and insistence upon cleanly conditions 
represent the correct solution of the milk problem because 
these measures do not involve any chemical change in the 
milk, and prevent as far as possible the introduction of 
germs. If the vessels are thoroughly clean and the dairy- 
man careful, the milk will contain but few germs. Bac- 
teria multiply so rapidly that when they are once introduced 
the milk soon becomes unfit for consumption. Therefore 
as a preventive measure, sterilization is entirely effective, 
and the milk suffers no injury. The practical difficulty 
which the advocates of this measure encounter is a feasible 
method of enforcing their requirements. Who will inspect 
the 35,000 dairies and the production of the 1,750,000 
quarts of milk which are consumed by New York City 
daily and the vast quantities consumed by every large 
city? This is the problem of the adherent of sterilization, 
and practicable methods of realizing his plans in full have 
not yet been devised. For many years to come, inspec- 
tion will not be adequate, yet clean milk is the goal of every
-P-A-G-E-77
  
THE MILK PROBLEM 71 
hygienist. It is not clear, however, that the program of 
reform should be limited at this time to efforts to secure 
such milk. 
The advocates of pasteurization insist that their method 
of treating milk will kill the bacteria and provide the infant 
with a wholesome food. A proper system of pasteurization, 
involving the heating of milk to 167 degrees Fahrenheit 
for a period of twenty minutes, or to 155 degrees for thirty 
minutes, kills nearly all of the harmful bacteria without 
resulting in serious injury to the milk. The chief single 
source of children’s diseases is thereby removed. The 
method, however, does not remove the dirt from the milk 
and has been opposed on the ground that “milk cooked 
with the dirt in it is not so good as pure milk.’”” This ob- 
jection to pasteurization cannot be gainsaid. Besides, 
some mischievous germs often escape death and continue 
to threaten the health of the child. This is especially 
true of the scarlet fever germs. The most convincing 
argument for pasteurization is the absence of other prac- 
ticable means for providing the infant with a reasonably 
good milk supply. The chief hope for decreasing infant 
mortality lies in the use of pasteurized milk. Either 
municipal activity or the work of private philanthropies, 
or both, is necessary to carry out a program of pasteuri- 
zation. An element of danger in this method of securing 
good milk lies in the tendency to regard pasteurization 
as a solution of the milk question rather than as a tem- 
porary expedient. The ultimate goal must always be the 
production of good milk. 
A combination of the two methods of solution is un- 
doubtedly the most feasible plan of operation. If carried 
out, such a'plan would not only save countless infant lives, 
but would also prepare the way for a clean milk supply. 
The New York Milk Conference of 1906 decided that pas- 
teurization is not necessary if the milk is absolutely clean,
-P-A-G-E-78
TT Ee Ee Oe ee a ee Pee ee en ee Te ee ee ey 
72 CHILD PROBLEMS 
and opposed a system of compulsory pasteurization, but 
recommended that infant milk depots supply both raw 
and pasteurized milk. The rapidity and facility with which 
germs multiply when they are reintroduced into pasteur- 
ized milk was urged as a serious objection to compulsory 
methods, and therefore special stress was laid on the 
necessity of procuring clean milk. 
4. Tae Exprrmence or Rocusster, New York. 
The wonderful success of the city of Rochester in lessen- 
ing its child mortality has already been mentioned, and- 
the methods used to bring about this change require fur- 
ther notice. The former excessive death rate among 
children under five years of age called for an explanation, 
and unclean milk was eventually charged with responsi- 
bility for this heavy mortality. Accordingly, under the 
very able direction of Dr. George W. Goler, health officer 
of the city, notable experiments were inaugurated. The 
crusade was carried on in spite of opposition from certain 
private interests that were affected. Political opposition 
was also encountered, but on account of the results that 
were obtained, there remains at present no formal objection 
to the campaign for good milk. The work of reform com- 
prised a twofold activity: first, the realization of a purer 
milk supply ; second, education of mothers in infant care 
and management and in the proper use of food. The in- 
vestigation of dairies revealed almost inconceivable con- 
ditions. Dr. Goler found that “the stables were dirty, 
festooned with cobwebs and badly drained ; the surround- 
ings, sinks of mud and cow manure; the utensils dirty, 
often containing layers of sour milk with an admixture of 
countless millions of bacteria; and the milk itself so im- 
perfectly cared for and badly cooled that it often soured 
before reaching the consumer.” To revolutionize these
-P-A-G-E-79
    
THE MILK PROBLEM is 
conditions seemed almost impossible, especially without 
raising the price of milk, and in the early stages of 
the propaganda this appeared undesirable. The first 
step taken was the pasteurization of milk — the most 
feasible method at the time. During the summer of 
1897 two [milk stations were established, each with a 
trained nurse in charge. The stations were humble 
estalishments provided with very simple furniture but 
with the needed equipment. The best milk obtainable 
was sécured and was then pasteurized at 180 degrees 
Fahrenheit for twenty minutes, after modification to 
-suit four different age periods of the baby. The milk 
was placed in bottles of four different sizes, to corres- 
pond to the ages of the children. It was then retailed 
at cost to the mothers, 
An initial step in the successful organization of the work 
was the conference with the mother, who was often ignorant 
of the proper methods of caring for her children. At the 
time of her first purchase of milk the mother was required 
to appear at the station and to bring her baby with her 
for examination. A milk combination suited to the needs 
of the child was prescribed by the physician or nurse, the 
baby was weighed, and the mother was instructed in regard 
to the changing needs of the child. A pamphlet containing 
advice on the care of babies was printed in various lan- 
guages so as to meet the lingual conditions of the city, and 
was distributed among mothers. 
For two years the work was carried on as described above, 
but the number of stations was increased to four. The 
results were apparent in a reduced death rate for children 
under five and in better care of the surviving ones. The 
pasteurization of impure milk was, however, unsatisfactory 
to the authorities, and it was therefore abandoned for the 
better policy of striving to secure milk originally pure and 
wholesome and consequently fit food for babies. This
-P-A-G-E-80
  
74 CHILD PROBLEMS 
reform required the sterilization of all the utensils in which 
the milk was placed, and the use of clean milk. In 1899 
a central milk station was established on a dairy farm. 
Owing to the precautions taken by the farmer, and the 
complete sterilization of all milk utensils, pasteurization 
was then abandoned and the raw milk was apportioned 
to the stations located in the city. In order to educate 
producers the central station was located on a different 
farm each succeeding year. The influence of this rotation 
extended far beyond the dairy directly affected. This 
aggressive method for providing the poor with good milk 
was supplemented by vigorous inspection of all dairies . 
contributing to the city milk supply. A well-developed 
system of marking and grading dairy conditions, as well 
as the milk placed upon the market, has raised the standards 
of dairymen, and has resulted in a lower rate of infant 
mortality. 
The essential features of the Rochester experiment are 
the following : — : 
1. Sterilization of utensils instead of pasteurization of 
milk. 
2. Rigid inspection of dairies. 
3. Inspection of cows and tests for tuberculosis. 
4. Periodical bacteriological examinations of the milk 
used in the city. 
5. Milk stations for the dispensation of good milk. 
6. Education of mothers in regard to infant care and 
management. 
7. The use of modified milk suited to the needs of babies 
at different ages. The general results of this work can 
be shown in figures of unmistakable meaning. Although 
Rochester has grown considerably during the last decade, 
the following achievement is indicated : —

This table clearly indicates that a tremendous reduc- 
in the death rate of children has occurred. Particularly 
gratifying is the result for the summer months, when the 
death rate is usually enormous. Not only has the aggre- 
gate number of deaths been reduced one half during these 
months, but the former disproportion between the summer 
rates and those for the rest of the year has been substan- 
tially modified. Good milk and better care of children 
produce definite consequences, in spite of warm weather 
and its tendency to aggravate the diarrheal diseases. 
Rochester was the pioneer in the campaign for good milk, 
and no other city can as yet boast of such successful results 
from the control of the milk supply. 
  5. Mitx Depots IN OTHER CITIES.   
The Straus milk depots of New York originated in 1893, 
when the philanthropist Straus donated a considerable 
sum of money for the establishment of depots in various 
parts of the city. These depots sell both modified and 
pasteurized milk at less than the cost price, and are there- 
fore a form of charitable endeavor. An immense patronage 
- has been developed, and the use of this milk undoubtedly 
accounts for a large part of the significant reduction in the

76 CHILD PROBLEMS 
infant mortality of New York City within the last few 
years. - 
Milk depots are becoming popular and have been intro- 
duced into a number of the large cities. They are operated 
by private philanthropy, however, and are not municipal 
depots such as one may find in Europe. In some cases a 
sufficient number have been scattered throughout a city 
to enable most persons desiring to use them to do so. The 
service of a majority of these stations, however, is still 
inadequate to meet the needs of the people. Furthermore, 
a campaign of education is necessary to arouse the poor 
to the advantage of good milk. As yet the true function 
of the depots is hardly understood by the mothers who 
should patronize them, and therefore their fullest usefulness 
has not yet been achieved. 
6. Cuxrnics ror Basizs. 
An auxiliary feature of some of the milk depots is the 
babies’ clinic. Here infants are examined by the physi- 
cian in charge, or, in his absence, by a trained nurse. As 
already explained in connection with the experience of 
Rochester, the baby is weighed, his case is carefully diag- 
nosed, milk of the proper modification is prescribed, the 
mother is instructed as to the best methods of feeding, 
and is ordered to bring the child to the depot whenever 
the physician finds this necessary. The condition of the 
mother and her ability to care for the child are noted, and 
in numerous cases the trained nurse is detailed to visit the 
homes of the babies to supplement the work of the mother. 
Such efforts have a cumulative effect, since mothers com- 
municate their experience to other women, who profit from 
the knowledge obtained. This form of education is defi- 
nitely bound up with the milk depot, but other methods of 
instruction are also employed. - These will be considered 
later. 
 
-P-A-G-E-83
  THE MILK PROBLEM 77 
7. Datry INspECTION. 
Recently a standard grade of milk known as “certified 
milk” has been introduced. This milk is produced under 
such sanitary conditions as to warrant its cleanliness and 
a low bacterial count. The milk must reach a certain 
fixed standard in order to gain the privilege of using the 
label. The clientéle of this grade of milk, on account of 
its prohibitive price, is largely confined to the well-to-do. 
The number of dairies meeting the requirements of certi- 
fied milk is comparatively small, and many difficulties must 
be overcome before the bulk of the milk produced will be 
raised to this standard. 
The chief efforts of municipalities in their campaigns 
for good milk are at present directed* toward the better 
inspection of dairies. New York City procures milk from 
six or more states, but inspectors from New York have no 
power to coerce dairymen from other states, yet some form 
of coercion is necessary. This is secured by dividing the 
inspection force into two separate groups; the one engages 
in the work of inspecting the dairies themselves, the other 
inspects milk after it is brought to the city and decides 
upon its quality and cleanliness. If found unfit for food, 
the milk is rejected and the dairyman who produced it 
is no longer permitted to ship his milk to the city. An 
effective check upon insanitary methods of production 
can thus be exercised by the inspectors who perform their 
work within the city itself. The traveling inspectors, 
although without direct power, can threaten to direct the 
city authorities td prohibit a recalcitrant dairyman from 
sending his disqualified milk to the city, and can thus 
compel him to improve the conditions under which his 
milk is produced. By means of an elaborate system of 
grgding, the comparative standing of each dairyman 
vfted can be placed on record, and doubtful producers

can be more carefully followed, aud if necessary their prod- 
uct can be rejected. The chief obstacle to adequate in- 
spection is the physical impossibility of supervising the 
dairies and of visiting them with sufficient frequency to 
ascertain whether standards are being maintained. Polit- 
ical interference usually operates to prevent the estab- 
lishment of an adequate force of inspectors, and at pres- 
ent the health departments are badly handicapped in their 
work. 
A very wholesome effect of persistent inspection of the 
milk supply is the detection of contagious diseases along 
the route, and the immediate stoppage of the milk sent 
from the sources of contamination. By means of a tell- 
tale register the infected milk is discovered. Whenever 
a case of contagious disease is reported, it is charged to 
the particular dairy of which the diseased person is a 
patron. If other cases can be similarly charged, an in- 
vestigation is instituted, and whenever the source of con- 
tagion can be definitely traced to an offending dairy, it 
is closed until the danger is passed. Epidemics of scarlet 
fever, measles, typhoid fever, diphtheria, and even of 
smallpox have been effectually checked in this way. The 
danger from scarlet fever can thus be largely minimized. 
An epidemic of this disease in Chicago was recently traced 
. toa single dairy in the state of Wisconsin. 
8. Summary. 
The methods employed in the United States to meet the 
» problem of a good milk supply are briefly the following : — 
1. Infant milk depots where modified and pasteurized 
milk may be secured at or below cost. 
2. The gradual evolution of a grade of superior milk 
known as “certified milk.” 
3. Increased inspection of dairies contributing to jhe 
milk supply. 1sj 
   
-P-A-G-E-85
  THE MILK PROBLEM : 79 
4. Bacteriological tests of the milk received within a 
city. 
5. Commercial pasteurization, which consists in heating 
milk to 167 degrees Fahrenheit for about twenty seconds. 
This has little value, however. 
6. Rejection of infected milk. 
7. The introduction of the tuberculin test for cows and 
the elimination of those which are diseased. 
8. Complete pasteurization of practically all milk until 
the efforts to secure pure raw milk have become measurably 
successful. 
Nors. Walker-Gordon laboratories have been established in a num- 
ber of the larger cities of the United States. These laboratories prepare 
modified milk suited to the needs of each individual child. The milk is 
sold on a commercial basis, and costs four or five times the price of ordinary 
milk. It is not therefore within the reach of the poorer classes, but its 
use is increasing among the wealthy. The cost of producing an indefi-- 
nite number of modifications is so great that the availability of this kind 
of milk for the children of the poor is quite remote.

  CHAPTER VII 
SUPPLEMENTARY METHODS OF DECREASING MORTALITY 
1. Avomance or ArtiriciaL Foops. 
Closely related to the problem of a pure milk supply 
is the question, to what extent should artificial food be 
substituted for nature’s method of providing for the wants 
of the child. If cow’s milk were to be generally used, then 
our problem could be concentrated; but other foods are 
substituted for milk. These cause a higher mortality than 
does cow’s milk, and therefore their general use by ignorant 
mothers should be discouraged. Many of the infant milk 
depots have adopted the policy of advocating the return 
to nature’s method wherever possible, and mothers are 
instructed to nurse the child themselves if they are physi- 
cally capable of doing so. The child is then provided with 
a food adapted to its needs. The extended endorsement 
of this policy abroad has resulted, especially in France, 
in a widespread return to the old and venerable method 
of feeding infants on breast milk. In our large cities the 
instruction given by the nurses attending the milk depots 
has also produced similar results. 
Many infants fed upon mother’s milk suffer and waste 
away. Consequences of this sort are an indication that 
the mother is physically unfit to nurse her child. Under 
these conditions breast feeding should be abandoned unless 
the mother is able to recuperate so that the child will begin 
to thrive and become a healthy, vigorous infant. Many 
instances plainly justify the use of cow’s milk. In France 
80

METHODS OF DECREASING MORTALITY 81 
again a part of the remedial work consists in providing the 
mother with food, and in restoring her health and vigor. 
Unquestionably the interests of the child will be better 
conserved if the mother is able to feed the child directly. 
In the United States, however, this method of solving the 
problem is only a remote contingency. Efforts to instruct 
and strengthen the mother will accomplish something, 
but the line of least resistance will be the use of cow’s milk. 
It will be difficult to change this practice. 
2. ParentTaL Epucation. 
Apart from the question of a puremilk supply, parental 
ignorance is the chief problem to which society must ad- 
dress itself in order to decrease infant mortality. This 
ignorance is so widespread that hundreds of thousands 
of children are annually paying the penalty. The problem 
is the more serious because no adequate system of pro- 
viding the mother with the needed information has as yet 
been devised. How to reach her is the question. Can it 
be done without overstepping the individualistic limits 
with which we have circumscribed ourselves? Or will it 
be necessary to act definitely for the social interest in spite 
of any paternalism that may be involved? 
As suggested in the forégoing chapter, infant milk de- 
pots have attempted reform by providing some informa- 
tion for the mothers. A number of the more progressive 
cities send a circular of information to all mothers of infants 
whose births are officially registered, and most cities have 
now made the registration of births compulsory. The 
efficacy of this method of instruction is doubtful because |‘ 
very little attention is ordinarily paid to freely distributed 
circulars. Unless the facts so conveyed can be vividly 
impressed on the minds of the mothers, little good is aeeom- 
plished. If the instruction is understood and heeded, 
splendid results may follow.

  82 CHILD PROBLEMS 
The experience of the little town of Huddersfield, Eng- 
land, will illustrate the effects of knowledge in the art of 
infant care and management.! In order to decrease the 
infant mortality of one of the bad districts of the town, 
the mayor in 1904 offered a small premium for every child 
who should reach the twelfth month of life. The promise 
was issued on a small card bearing the baby’s name and 
date of birth and the address of the parents. In addition 
the card contained rules of advice, most prominent of 
which was the appeal in favor of the use of mother’s milk. 
This appeal was fortified by the statement that infant 
mortality is fifteen times greater when other means of 
feeding are employed. Visits were as frequent as necessary, 
and special efforts were made to render service to mothers 
at the beginning of both the hot and the cold seasons, when 
disease is most frequent and the mortality from certain 
complaints is aggravated. This combination of methods 
gave remarkable results. During this trial year the infant 
mortality of the district fell from 134 per 1000 births to 
54 — a decline of approximately 60 per cent. The value 
of the plan can not be doubted, in spite of the small area 
covered and the temporary nature of the experiment. 
A remarkable instance of ignorance among mothers in 
New York City was unearthed by the New York Society 
for Improving the Conditions of the Poor. During the 
summer of 1906 the society carried on a campaign of edu- 
cation at its camp located at Sixty-Fourth Street and the 
East River. Mothers were addressed twice a week on 
topics of value in connection with the care of children. 
Among the statistical discoveries made were the following : 
out of 108 mothers, 79 had never heard how to feed babies ; 
95 knew nothing about the importance of the use of proper 
clothing for children ; 65 had no idea of the curative prop-

METHODS OF DECREASING MORTALITY 83 
erties of fresh air.1 These facts show an appalling lack 
of knowledge on these vital subjects. Coming from a 
different climate and guided by foreign methods, immi- 
grant mothers often fail utterly to realize the need of ade- 
quate clothing for their children during the cold seasons 
of the year. The author has seen small children indecently 
clad even for summer time playing on the open streets on 
cold February days. Such ignorance necessarily increases 
infant and child mortality. 
8. Tue Visitina Nurse. 
The duties of the.visiting nurse will eventually be so 
extended as to include the personal care of infants and 
the instruction of mothers in the principles of baby manage- 
ment. A visit to the family to nurse the young infant has 
value as training for the mother and the older children, 
and the knowledge thus disseminated is in no way measured 
by the number of infants visited. In Boston many small 
children have been saved in the homes of consumptives 
because the treatment of the latter has been accompanied 
by examinations of the children. The work of the nurse 
has heretofore been so strenuous that the cases visited 
have not usually included small babies, although young 
mothers have frequently become the objects of such visits. 
Special attention to the problem of infant mortality from 
the standpoint of the usefulness of the trained nurse as 
guide and teacher will be necessary before the problem 
can be satisfactorily solved. Nurses available for this 
purpose can be recruited from the various organizations 
which at present employ such service. The departments 
of health in some of our cities have nurses attached to their 
staff of officials; some cities have visiting nurse associa- 
1 Report of New York Association for Improving the Condition of 
the Poor, 1906, p. 76. 
 
-P-A-G-E-90
84 CHILD PROBLEMS 
tions maintained by private charity ; some charity organi- 
zation societies employ nurses directly ; some settlements 
also maintain one or more nurses, and many dispensaries 
command the services of the trained nurse. Some or all 
of these agencies will have to be used in the near future. 
The work must be done by employing these nurses as agents 
consciously bent upon the removal of the ignorance and 
carelessness of parents in respect to infant care and man- 
agement. To be successful permanently, instruction must 
also be furnished to prospective as well as to actual mothers. 
The general level of knowledge can only be raised through 
the use of rigid educational measures. As the social ser- 
vice work of our more progressive hospitals expands in 
volume, direct attention will be paid not only to the sick 
child, but also to the proper methods of prevention of 
disease. The school nurse whose field of employment is 
not limited to the school will also become a factor in trans- 
forming the conditions of the home, where she will be sent 
to follow up cases and to give instruction. 
4. Tue Day Nursery. 
The day nursery has a limited value in educating mothers, 
but the total number of children cared for at the nurseries 
is insignificant compared with the absolute number of 
children who are in need of more intelligent care. The 
nursery is patronized almost exclusively by women who 
work away from home, yet thousands of mothers do not 
enter the gainful occupations, and the influence of the nur- 
sery does not reach them. This influence usually operates 
through the children who are daily fed and cared for and 
who reflect at home the conditions and high standards 
of the nursery. Indirectly therefore the nursery trans- 
forms the life and ideals of a limited number of homes, 
but its work as a child-saving agency has not yet reached 
 
-P-A-G-E-91
    
METHODS OF DECREASING MORTALITY 85 
its full development. Its direct beneficiaries are, however, 
limited to small children, and the infant gains only indi- 
rectly from the new ideals established in the homes. 
5. Epucation or GIRLs. 
Our educational system needs revision, and the curricu- 
lum of the school must be made to conform more nearly to 
the actual requirements of our complex life of to-day. Our 
emphasis upon literary education is gradually being dis- 
placed by an insistence upon training which will equip 
the growing boy and girl for industrial and trade oppor- 
tunities. The economic needs are being supplied, but the 
social aspects of education have not received sufficient 
encouragement. It is important to train children for the 
varied duties of life, and our young men and young women 
must learn more about the requirements and needs of the 
home and of home life. Domestic science, the art of house- 
keeping, proper uses of food, the importance of cleanliness, 
hygiene, and sanitation, and other items of value should 
become part of the instruction of every young woman. 
Such instruction is so fundamental that it should rank 
as a most important preventive measure. 
Domestic science must soon form part of the curriculum 
in every elementary school. It should be made compul- 
sory for every girl in the seventh and eighth grades, and 
the amount of ground covered during these two grades 
ought to be sufficient to enable a young woman to learn 
all the rudiments necessary to begin a home on an intelli- 
gent basis. A very large percentage of public school pupils 
leave school before they reach these grades, many leaving 
at the end of the fifth year. The loss during the sixth year 
is also very heavy. Provision of some kind for these chil- 
dren is imperative, for it is precisely this class that swells 
the aggregate of undesirable elements in our large cities. 
Compulsory education will reach all who are not over-aged,
-P-A-G-E-92
  86 CHILD PROBLEMS 
but the latter form a special problem and can not be neg- 
lected. Either they must be given the training in special 
classes, or they must be held at school until they have had 
the needed training. The group of girls most in need of 
the training afforded by domestic science and household 
economy are least liable to be reached by the present 
halting methods of instruction. The majority of cities 
have done little for the cause of domestic science, and 
therefore the fundamental cause of parental ignorance still 
remains. Domestic science in the high school should be 
encouraged, and it will bea source of pleasure and also of 
profit to the high school girl. Instruction in this branch, 
however, does not benefit the children of the poor, because 
they do not reach the high school ; and effective preventive 
work for the child of the coming generation can be per- 
formed only by educating the girl and boy who are most 
in need of the training which these branches will yield. 
The introduction of such courses into the secondary schools 
is only a palliative, and can in no way be regarded as a cure. 
Our schools are strangely lacking in their provisions for 
instruction in household economy, and the need of reform 
is urgent and immediate. 
6. Trarnine or Boys. 
Boys likewise need additional training, especially in 
hygienic methods and sanitation. The value of nature’s 
curative forces and regenerative agencies must be taught 
in order to give the boy a proper appreciation of the danger 
and injury incident to insanitary housing conditions. The 
uses of fresh air, the germ-destroying power of sunlight, 
the effects of contamination of air, the influence of gases, 
standards in regard to sufficient air space, and other neces- 
sary knowledge relating to proper housing conditions must 
be effectually taught to all young boys. The meager 
knowledge gained at present in the study of physiology
-P-A-G-E-93
  
METHODS OF DECREASING MORTALITY 87 
is entirely insufficient, and an extension of this study, by 
taking up the lines indicated, is necessary ; otherwise the 
instruction must be given as a separate branch of the work 
of the school. Whatever be the course followed, it must be 
judged from the standpoint of efficiency. The knowledge 
which makes for better homes and more sanitary houses, 
and which will accordingly save the lives of thousands of 
babies, must be acquired before the homes are formed and 
before babies are born. If this is not done, children will 
always be the victims of parental ignorance and neglect. 
The evening school, with its classes in appropriate subjects 
for both young men and young women, and the classes 
formed in settlements and other institutions which strive 
to meet this deficiency in the education of the child, reach 
a small number of persons only and can not adequateld 
meet the situation. Furthermore, this work is, or shouly 
be, considered a mere temporary expedient, to be aban- 
doned when the elementary schools expand their functions 
so as to include home science among the subjects taught. 
However, a temporary expansion of the work of these 
classes should be cordially welcomed, because the public 
school does not now meet the needs of a large bulk of our 
growing youth, and many anticipated reforms are not yet 
being realized. 2 
7. Municrpa, Campaicns acarinst Inrant Mora ity. 
Special campaigns of education in our large cities can 
do something to mitigate the evil of infant mortality. The 
boards of health, through the physicians whom they detail 
for work in the slums, can educate parents, or the boards 
can teach the latter directly in appropriate ways. Cam- 
paigns of this sort should be carried on during the hot 
weather especially, but should not be confined to the summer 
months, because the problem of care in the winter season 
and of protection from exposure also demands attention.
-P-A-G-E-94

88 CHILD PROBLEMS 
Private agencies should introduce effective methods of 
propaganda ; but the cities should so enlarge the scope of 
their work as to spread effectually the desired information 
among the poor. 
8. PREVENTION OF OVERCROWDING. 
Fatalities among children depend in part on the bad 
housing conditions of a city. The nature of overcrowding 
which is most dangerous to the susceptible child is the 
crowding of a large number of persons into a single flat 
or group of rooms. The density per acre may be very 
heavy, yet the conditions under which the individual fam- 
ilies live accord with all the demands of sanitation and 
cleanliness. Tenement houses well cared for and well 
inspected by the city authorities may house a dense popu- 
lation without special injury or excessive suffering to the 
indwellers. This is particularly true if houses are built 
according to the best modern models. In actual practice, 
however, a heavy per acre density is usually associated 
with tenement house conditions of the worst type, the size 
of the families of the better classes being uniformly smaller 
and the families themselves refusing to submit to such 
crowding. Congestion invariably means poor conditions 
and inadequate equipment. 
Investigations have made quite plain the following 
propositions in regard to the effects of crowding: first, the _ 
mortality of a population increases as the density per acre 
is increased, and is considerably higher when a very heavy _ 
density obtains. Second, mortality is much less if single 
tenement houses only are built upon the lots than if front 
and rear tenements exist. Statistics for New York City 
(old) show that the mortality of children under five was 
nearly twice as high in the latter type of buildings. Third, 
mortality varies inversely according to the number of rooms
-P-A-G-E-95
METHODS OF DECREASING MORTALITY 89 
per apartment. English figures have shown that the one- 
room apartment is nearly twice as fatal as the four-room 
dpartment. This form of overcrowding is by far the most 
dangerous to life and health, as it is directly related to the 
problem of adequate air space, especially for sleeping pur- 
poses. It also prevents the enjoyment of sufficient sun- 
light and ventilation. It is especially under such con- 
ditions that a large infant mortality ensues. It becomes 
impossible to provide the child with a sufficient amount of 
nature’s curative forces and properties. It has been shown 
that in Vienna, Austria, when 8 per cent of the population 
was overcrowded the mortality increased more than 100 
per cent above the normal and that all overcrowding was 
accompanied by a high rate of mortality.!. The noxious 
influence of overcrowding upon the life and health of the 
young child is well known. There remains only the prob- 
lem of ascertaining the precise influence of this factor in 
order that our cities may become more resolute in providing 
and demanding sufficient air and room. Reform in housing 
conditions, including the building of wholesome tenements 
and the proper inspection of all tenements, is urgently 
needed, as well as insistence upon better conditions in 
and about the two-family houses, especially in regard to 
plumbing, sewage, garbage disposal, closets, ete. 
9. PREVENTION OF EMPLOYMENT oF Marrrep WoMEN. 
An additional method of lessening our infant mortality 
consists in reducing the number of married women em- 
ployed in factories, offices, and mercantile establishments. 
In 1900 the total number of married women in the United 
States engaged in the gainful occupations was 769,477, or 
5.6 per cent of the entire number of married women. Al- 
though a small number, it represents an increase of one per 
1 Bailey, W. B., Modern Social Conditions, p. 323.  
-P-A-G-E-96
  90 ’ CHILD PROBLEMS 
cent in the proportion of married women at work when 
compared with the census of 1890. We must assume there- 
fore that the tendency is in favor of the increased use of 
married women in industry. Sour heavy recent immi- 
gration from Europe has increased this proportion, although 
statistics to that effect have not yet been gathered. Many 
Italian, Polish, Bohemian, and French Canadian mothers 
are at present employed in our factories and workshops, 
and therefore are compelled to neglect their children:¥ In 
Boston recently a young child was regularly brought to 
one of the factories of the city at noon to be nursed by the 
mother during her intermission from work. In Fall River 
a large percentage of the married women are at work in 
the cotton mills; the infant mortality in this city is not 
only very high, but it exceeds that of every American city 
having a population of 100,000 or more. The rates for 
diarrhea and enteritis are also disproportionately high. 
There can be no doubt of the causal relation between this 
high mortality and the presence of mothers in the factories. 
10. SuppREssION oF OTHER CausEs or Morrtatity. 
The immorality of many men and the consequent in- 
fliction of disease upon their offspfimg is responsible for a 
growing proportion of infant and child deaths. Innocent 
women are frequent victims of such men, but the peril to 
children is perhaps the graver, because deformity or death 
is the frequent penalty. 
Poverty and mal-feeding are causes of atrophy, and 
many underfed and emaciated children can be daily seen in 
our large hospitals. The chief blame for this suffering, 
however, rests with the parents. Their ignorance is often 
responsible for the method of feeding which entails such 
serious consequences upon the child. Absolute poverty 
is less often the cause of death than is malnutrition.
-P-A-G-E-97
  
METHODS OF DECREASING MORTALITY 91 
11. Summary. 
In addition to the improvement of the milk supply, the 
chief remedies for our excessive infant and child mortality 
may be summarized as follows: the education of mothers 
as to the superiority of breast feeding; instruction of 
parents, especially mothers, concerning the value of good 
food, fresh air, sunlight, clean water, ventilation, and out- 
door exercise ; instruction of young women in the art of 
domestic economy and personal hygiene and of young men 
in hygiene and proper sanitation ; diffusion of knowledge 
relative to malnutrition and improper feeding ; increased 
caution against exposure of young children ; improvement 
of the housing conditions of the poor; day nurseries for 
the children of women who must work, though efforts 
should be made to diminish the number of married women 
in industry ; and higher ideals of personal purity, especially 
among boys and men.

PLAY 
1. IntTRopucTION. 
All of our four-footed friends of the higher orders indulge 
in play while young, and to them it is a most valuable ex- 
perience in their training for life. Whatever be the correct 
theory of play — that it is practice in the line of future 
methods of conduct, that it is simply the discharge of the 
surplus energy of the young, or that it is for the purpose 
of relaxation and recreation only — whatever theory be 
adopted, the inestimable value of play to the child and to 
the nation can not be gainsaid. | Play is an irrepressible 
method of self-expression. Fortunately the absolute pre- 
vention of play is impossible. It is one of nature’s gifts, 
and needs only to be utilized aright and so directed as to. 
become of the maximum service to the growing boy and 
girl. 
2. Puysican Errects or Puay. 
Play touches every phase of the development of youth. 
The effects are not only physical, but mental, moral, and 
‘, social as well. As all children play somewhere, the physical 
‘effect of ordinary play need not be discussed, but that of 
the supervised playground is an important object of in- 
quiry. Well-organized play results in a symmetrical de- 
velopment of the body through the use of such games and 
modes of exercise as will bring into activity the largest 
possible variety of Ynuscles. No single game exercises 
95 
 
-P-A-G-E-102
  96 CHILD PROBLEMS 
and develops all the muscles of the body, therefore a vari- 
ety alone will afford the opportunity of complete develop- 
ment. Furthermore the use of the same game becomes 
monotonous and repels the player. The total disuse of 
an organ tends to atrophy it, and a reasonable exercise of 
all organs is necessary to promote the symmetrical develop- 
ment of the young child. 
The child of the slum suffers from the disadvantage of 
insanitary surroundings, and is dwarfed and stunted by 
their effects upon his plastic body and mind.’ Without 
facilities for play on open areas where reasonably fresh air 
can be secured, he can not develop properly.’ Accordingly 
the people of the poorer sections of the cities are smaller 
in stature and physically weaker than those living in the 
better sections. For example, a difference of three inches 
in height between the wealthy and the East End Jew of Lon- 
don illustrates the consequences of a bad environment... 
In Glasgow the slum population, although composed of 
similar racial elements, is about four inches shorter than the 
people of the surrounding country regions — an eloquent 
commentary upon the physique-destroying powers of the 
slums. Organized play on ample playgrounds furnished 
by our cities will militate against this insidious enemy of 
mankind. The physical organ in need of special care can 
thus be developed, normal stature and strength be acquired, 
and a greater capacity for survival be evolved. 
4 
3..Puay AND TUBERCULOSIS. - 
One of the diseases against which special inroads can 
be made by the establishment of organized play is’ tuber- 
culosis. A disease of filth, it will long remain with us, and 
a development of resisting power in the individual is ab- 
solutely necessary. fhe play of growing children under 
good surroundings will, more than any other agency, pre- 
 
-P-A-G-E-103
  PLAY oF 
pare the child for the struggle with this disease. Although 
the greatest prevalence of tuberculosis is during the adult 
period of life, notably between the thirtieth and fortieth 
years, the time for preparation against the disease is during . 
childhood. Proper development of the appropriate organs 
forms a splendid asset for the individual when he is later 
dangerously exposed to the tubercular germ. Play as a 
precautionary measure cannot be urged too strongly, es- 
pecially for weakly and subnormal children. 
4. Tue Socta, VaLugs or Puay. 
The social and moral influences of play produce indelible 
effects upon the child mind. All play is didactic, and 
leaves its traces for good or bad as the case may be. Un- 
organized and spontaneous play often develops the bully 
and the coward; systematic play minimizes these defects 
and impresses the ideals taught by organization and co- 
operation, ~The recognition of mutual rights is one of its - 
initial values. These rights are but little understood by ° 
the unthinking child and, when brute force permits, are 
often entirely overthrown or perverted into a mere tolera- 
tion of privileges. Few children are spontaneously gen- 
erous; the majority are selfish and require companionship 
to soften their egoism. On'the supervised playground, 
a new régime is put into operation. The right to the use 
of the sand pile can not be monopolized by any ambitious 
player. *All things are held in common, and every child 
must be granted an equal opportunity. So with the use 
of swings, of ladders, and of every device for-the child’s 
enjoyment. In the games no group of children can usurp 
all the privileges. Each individual learns that others 
have rights that must be respected, and that these in turn 
must have due consideration for his own rights. 
The development of the idea of mutual rights possesses 
a profound significance for the growth of a healthy citizen-

ship. Our rapidly increasing density of population and 
the increasing number of contacts which it involves dée- 
mand new limitations of rights and a more ample recog- 
nition of the exact boundaries of the rights of the indi- 
vidual. Failure in municipal government and failure in 
other public activities can in part be remedied by Ie-— 
ing both the extent of, and the limitation of, indivic 
rights. Play therefore becomes a most important school 
of citizenship, and supplies the child with one of his most 
urgent needs. Allied to the development of mutual rights 
is the growth of self-control, which is a natural consequence 
of the former. ‘The social results which follow are expressed 
in such ethical values as order, obedience, self-denial, and 
discipline. Coérdination, or the spirit of teamwork, also 
develops. Unless the child observes proper restraint, he 
can not succeed as a member of a baseball nine or a foot- 
ball eleven or of any other group of which the individual 
forms a necessary part. The teamwork which enables a 
body of school children to outwit. a fire in the building 
is fostered by well-conducted play. The soldier boy can 
be almost instantly detected by his carriage: The team 
work of play develops a characteristic most necessary for 
the success of our democratic experiment. 
(The self-repression, not self-effacement, which. develops 
from the influence of play, makes obedience something 
more than unwilling subordination. It becomes_respect 
for authority as well as deference for the welfare of the 
group.) A sense of the value and of the uses of order is 
accordingly developed, and this becomes the mainstay 
of social stability. Order in government and in society 
has its counterpart in the harmonious organization of play. 
Whether or not men shall be successful in the control of 
government, depends upon their training, and the values 
which play inculcates will form no mean part in the solu- 
tion of this question. :

*Play also emphasizes the importance of the group as 
contrasted with the worth of the individual. The latter 
soon learns that group life is more desirable than isolation} 
Consequently his activities must make the codperation 
of others attractive. The group becomes predominant 
for two reasons: first, it is necessary to interest the indi- 
vidual and supply him with the desired pleasures ; second, 
the group must be preferred in order that the individual 
pleasures may not perish. The success of the team is more 
important than the brilliant achievements of a single player. 
Accordingly the necessary concessions to the interests of 
the group demand certain sacrifices of the individual. 
An ethical quality of unmistakable value is thus developed. . . 
This use of play is in direct harmony with the present social 
needs, which emphasize the group at the apparent but not 
real cost of the individual. 
The growth of the instinct of codperation is perhaps 
’ the-most.valuable-result of play. Codperation is the ideal 
of the democratic movement, and capacity in this direction 
needs further enlargement. Ability to codperate spells 
ability to excel. Absence of this power means ultimate 
disorganization and disorder. Practice in accomplishing 
a given task together impresses boys or girls with the im- 
mense value of concerted action. Things must be done 
in unison. Every person takes part, no one can be omitted. 
The individual begins to learn that he is necessary for 
pleasure, and also that without his sane codperation neither 
he nor his associates will be able to enjoy themselves. 
Thus through practice and sheer necessity capacity for 
coéperation develops. The citizen will not govern wisely 
until he learns the value of codperation and until he feels 
himself a part of the government. If government is only 
moderately successful, he must feel the disparagement ; if 
it fails, he must participate in the disgrace ; if it succeeds, 
he may rejoice in the accomplishment as he would if it were
-P-A-G-E-106
    100 CHILD PROBLEMS 
entirely his own. Good government depends upon a coép- 
eration so intense that each accomplishment will inevi- 
tably reflect itself in the attitude of the individual. (The 
successful adjustment of the individual characteristics to 
those of a group so as to make interrelations possible is 
a prime task of the playground and can nowhere else re- 
ceive equal encouragement and development. Play will 
improve the good citizenship of a nation, and therefore 
becomes a wise and safe form of social insurance and 4 
guarantee of better government. 
One possible influence of play is less reassuring ; unless 
it is carefully carried on, an unhealthful development of 
the gang spirit may result. The absence of complete de- 
mocracy tends to segregate the children into antagonistic 
groups among whom a spirit of intolerance may arise. 
Base leaders appear, and these dominate the actions of the 
gang, which panders to the baser instincts that are present 
on the playground. The heterogeneous elements will, 
if amalgamating influences are absent, form numerous 
gangs in which the spirit of true codperation will fail and 
intrigue as well as enmity will control action. The prin- 
ciple of complete self-government can not be successfully 
applied to immature minds, and play, in order to conserve 
its good effects and to eliminate its evil propensities, must 
be properly supervised. 
5. Menrat Vauur or Ptay. 
The child can not play without receiving mental influ- 
ences of various kinds. Play is not only educational, but 
stimulates the capacity for mental growth. The backward 
child through the influence of judiciously prescribed play 
accelerates his feeble intellectual development and becomes 
capable of better work. The normal child adds new 
mental qualities, such as initiative, alertness, mental ability, 
and foresight. The need of alertness stimulates the child    
-P-A-G-E-107
RAY 101 
to activity, and the task of solving the problems which 
every play presents requires a fresh display of initiative 
for each added instance. “The quality of leadership devel- 
ops, and this involves the use of the calculating faculties 
and requires constant planning and the use of judgment. 
Play does not imply complete mental relaxation ; the men- 
tal development which it occasions is merely hidden be- 
hind a mass of pleasurable sensations. The advantages 
of properly conducted play have a value far in excess of 
the energy and cost required for adequate supervision. 
Therefore the ethical values of play must be carefully 
guarded, and its consequences must receive the attention + 
of every student of society. The playground movement 
is alive with tremendous social possibilities. 
6. Recent APPRECIATION OF Pay. 
Until recent years the value of play has not received due 
consideration. The majority of parents, and of teachers 
as well, have regarded the play of the child as a natural 
but somewhat useless activity. Parents often prevent 
their children, especially the older ones, from indulging in 
play because they do not understand its character-building 
qualities and believe it a mere waste of time. As a needed 
relief from the confinement and concentration of the school- 
room, its usefulness has, however, been generally accepted. 
The physical effects of play received the first recognition, 
and its social and moral effects were unobserved until 
some of their necessary consequences became too patent 
to remain hidden from the view of the sociologist and the 
moralist. That some of the world’s great teachers have 
long since recognized the uses of play is true, but the popu- 
lar mind has not followed them, and the discovery had 
to be made anew. 
The present attitude toward play is a mark of the chang- 
ing tendency in regard to our many social problems. The 
mt
-P-A-G-E-108
  
_ CHILD geen 
  social reformer finds that play and the playground are 
powerful agencies which, if carefully used, will accomplish 
much good. ‘he potential criminal of the slums must be 
transformed into a law-abiding citizen, and the indifferent 
must become zealous in the cause of reform. The depleted 
physique of the children of the poor must be renewed, and 
their intellectual and moral improvement be required. 
The riotous child of the street and the gang of the dismal 
alley must be reclaimed and their energies directed toward 
nobler standards of living. The accomplishment of these 
results is the aim and hope.of the advocates of the play- 
ground movement. The results of the meager efforts made 
to promote play have partially justified this optimism. 
The social attitude toward play is now a healthful and 
hopeful one, but the problem is serious, owing to the diffi- 
culties which are naturally involved in the realization of 
comprehensive plans.
-P-A-G-E-109
CHAPTER II 
THE PLAYGROUND MOVEMENT 
1. Tae Pray Prose. 
Play is an easy problem after the facilities for play are 
provided. Boys and girls can always be discovered in 
sufficient numbers to use the grounds, but the practical 
difficulty lies in capacity to acquire adequate playgrounds 
and equipment. In some cities the need of room for the 
school child was hardly considered until recently. Ac- 
cordingly many school buildings are entirely without 
attached playgrounds for children, who must either re- 
frain from play or indulge their recreational instincts in 
the streets. The schoolhouses of the slum districts have 
been the chief sufferers, although these localities are pre- 
cisely the ones in which the needs are greatest. New 
York City has school buildings for which no provision 
whatever has been made for surface playgrounds. In 
Philadelphia the recent facilities for a certain school con- 
sisted of a little slope used by the boys as an incline on 
which they slid down upon the street-car track. In nu- 
merous instances in the large cities the entire space available 
for play purposes consists of a few square feet of ground 
directly in front of the school building. This is often 
very scrupulously paved over with brick, which makes 
play unattractive and leaves the children without oppor- 
tunity to enjoy themselves except upon the street. 
In New York City, owing to the character of both the 
tenement houses and the school buildings, much progress 
103
-P-A-G-E-110
  104 CHILD PROBLEMS 
has recently been made in transforming the roofs of the 
latter into suitable playgrounds. A number of distinct 
advantages arise from this solution of the problem. The 
streets are so narrow and the amount of space that could 
be procured is so small and inadequate that the roof play- 
ground affords more real space than could otherwise be 
obtained. In this way the children avoid the demoralizing 
influences and the contaminated air of the streets, and enjoy 
an abundance of health-giving sunlight. The roof of the 
building is covered with wire netting so as to make acci- 
dents impossible. The playground is sometimes accom- 
panied by a small roof garden. This is used for ex- 
periments in the cultivation of flowers and vegetables. 
Several other cities have begun to copy this plan of provid- 
ing playgrounds and recreation. 
In the foreign sections of the large cities, where over- 
crowding is common, the streets are in actual practice 
used to a considerable extent by both boys and girls for 
purposes of play. Some of the asphalt-covered streets 
on the lower East Side in New York City are very useful 
to the small children who have inadequate facilities for 
play elsewhere. The authorities are generous to the child, 
and do not drive every fun-loving urchin from the street ; 
accordingly the streets little used for wagon traffic become 
the favorite resort not only of children but of persons of 
all ages. An attempt is likewise made to limit the traffic 
as much as possible to certain streets, and this precaution- 
ary measure increases the breathing space of the inhabitant 
of the slums. The indifference with which both sidewalks 
and streets are used by pedestrians illustrates the indul- 
gence of the city authorities. The condition of the streets 
in the slum districts of other large cities is such that the 
child can not use them so readily and successfully as in 
New York. Unless streets are better paved and cared 
for than they are in the typical slum, they give the children 
| 
 
-P-A-G-E-111
THE PLAYGROUND MOVEMENT 105 
very inferior service. Furthermore, the associations fre- 
quently demoralize and corrupt the players. 
The numerous vacant lots in many cities are temporarily 
turned into playgrounds by the boys of the neighborhood. 
In some cases the permission of the authorities is necessary 
before these places can be used for play purposes. This 
is quite readily secured, however, and thus the playground 
room of a city can be enormously extended beyond the 
meager facilities directly under municipal and _philan- 
thropic control. Play on these lots is not supervised, and 
is conducted by the boys according to their own plans and 
methods, and therefore the good results expected from 
play are not always realized. It relieves the congestion 
of the streets, however, and has a limited value. 
The fundamental question for every city which intends 
to inaugurate a system of playgrounds is-that of securing 
funds for the purchase of the grounds. The needed recrea- 
tion centers, if established at all, must be created in the 
localities where children can use them. In the crowded 
quarters of the city the cost of real estate is high, and very 
little vacant space can be found. The cost of acquiring 
a small plot of ground in such a district is almost pro- 
hibitive, so less expensive centers are sometimes secured. 
No city can establish a system of playgrounds except at 
a considerable cost, but the benefits of the enterprise 
measured in the gain from investment in character, morals, 
and social spirit, are well worth the financial expenditure 
which is involved. 
2. OricIN or THE MovEMENT. 
The playground movement in the United States is a 
recent development. The idea seems to have been bor- 
rowed from the city of Berlin, where small sand piles had 
been scattered through the public parks for the purpose 
of giving the children an opportunity to play. Boston
-P-A-G-E-112
  a ee ee Rianne ee 
AGO" 5 4] CHILD PROBLEMS 
heard about this innovation, and in 1886 two religious 
societies of that city followed the Berlin plan. Since then 
the number of playgrounds in Boston has been greatly in- 
creased. Philadelphia and New York next introduced 
playgrounds of various kinds. Nearly all of the large 
cities now give some attention to the problem and are 
providing a limited number of such recreation centers. 
The most rapid strides have occurred since 1900, and in 
the last decade the greatest single impetus given to the 
movement was the convention of the National Playground 
Association at Chicago in the summer of 1907. A second 
convention was held in New York City the following year, 
when twenty-nine states were represented, thus indicating 
the momentum which the movement had acquired. These 
two congresses resulted in the formation of definite organi- 
zation to carry.on the work of providing children with 
the necessary recreational facilities. Systematic agitation 
through the instrumentality of a special magazine and of 
pamphlet literature has become a prominent factor in the 
campaign. Even the small cities are now beginning to 
realize their shortcomings, and are interested in the move- 
ment. & 
3. Types or PLAYGROUNDS. 
Various types of playgrounds are in use, and some of the 
recreation centers are intended for the younger as well as 
for the older children. The type of playground and the 
method of its control vary with the age group which is to 
be accommodated. The park for small children as found 
in many cities is a distinct type. Some parks are divided 
into two parts, one for boys and the other for girls ; often 
an entire playground is limited to the use of a single sex. 
Special provision is sometimes made for the little children, 
who are given a small inclosed space into which the others 
may not come. Usually these playgrounds contain sand 
 
-P-A-G-E-113
THE PLAYGROUND MOVEMENT 107 
gardens, swings, teeterboards, and some additional appa- 
ratus, besides space for games of various kinds. In the 
middle of the sand garden is a covered inclosure contain- 
ing the sand. The level of the sand pile is about two feet 
above that of the adjacent ground, and the sand is accessi- 
ble from all sides. The pile is perhaps twenty feet long, 
and about half as wide. Small children are allowed to dig 
in this sand pile, and are carefully watched by an attendant 
so that no accidents may occur and that trouble among 
the children may be avoided. Some opportunity is also 
given for digging in the sand and in the garden around the 
inclosed sand pile. Here the older children may enjoy 
themselves. The swings and teeter boards may be out 
in the open air or under a protecting roof. Some of the 
parks are provided with equipment of both kinds. In 
certain parts of the park seats are provided for the child 
mother, who may rest there with her smaller brothers and 
sisters. These parks usually open at nine o’clock in the 
morning and close about sunset, and are in use through 
the warmer months of the year only. Formerly many 
of them were mere vacation schools operating for ten or 
twelve weeks during the summer, but now a general exten- 
sion of the time has been granted. 
A second type of playground accommodates children of 
all ages, and therefore contains a greater measure of pro- 
vision for the older boy, who does not dig in the sand nor 
play baby games. In addition to provision for the small 
child, opportunities for physical exercise are given to both 
boys and girls, and appropriate machinery for this purpose 
is furnished. The grounds contain poles, ladders, horizon- 
tal and parallel bars, play-horses, small merry-go-rounds, 
and other apparatus. The boys are usually better provided 
with the means of enjoyment than are the girls, but the 
latter are gradually being recognized. This type of play- 
ground is not usually inclosed, and may be used whenever 
ae
-P-A-G-E-114
  108 CHILD PROBLEMS 
the condition of the weather allows. Accordingly on a 
bright winter day and frequently in the early spring these 
grounds may be seen covered with boys eager to use such 
playground apparatus as may be allowed to remain all 
winter. In the summer months they are covered far into 
the night with enthusiastic children. 
The ordinary city park is of limited service to the child. 
The inhabitants of the slums can draw but little comfort 
from a park several miles away. Fairmount Park in 
Philadelphia, with its 3000 acres of land, is hardly used by 
the poor child. It is too far away. Only the well-to-do 
can afford the necessary car fares. The thousands of little 
children seen there are not the children of the poorer sec- 
tions of the city; hence the park has a limited usefulness 
only. Even Central Park, on the narrow island of Man- 
hattan, is but meager relief to the child of the East Side, 
and it can attract no children at all from the more distant 
slum sections. Playgrounds and parks for small children 
must be located within one fourth mile, and for large 
children within one half mile of the home of the child. In 
spite of their many prohibitions parks offer a large oppor- 
tunity for play and sport. Games of many kinds can be 
played, but the chief advantage is for the larger boy and 
girl rather than for the small child. The larger and better 
equipped park is seldom visited by the poor except on those 
rare occasions which form distinct events in the life of these 
people. 
In New York and in a few additional cities recreation 
piers have been established, but these again cater to the 
older children and are not serviceable for the smaller ones. 
The chief source of enjoyment here consists of music, which 
is furnished free of charge by the cities, as is often done 
during the summer months in many of the parks. The 
evening recreation centers and the evening roof playgrounds 
of New York City are additional methods of providing 
recreation for children.
-P-A-G-E-115

THE PLAYGROUND MOVEMENT 109 
Progress in the socialization of public school property 
has resulted in the increased use of the playground at- 
tached to the school, and boards of education are beginning 
to realize the importance of this step. These grounds are 
now in some cities open to children after school hours, 
instead of being closed immediately at the end of the ses- 
sions of the day. Children may therefore remain on the 
grounds instead of being compelled to seek the doubtful 
opportunities of the street. Owing to the absence of suit- 
able supervisors, success in these experiments has unfor- 
tunately not been sufficiently marked. Accordingly dis- 
order has been common, and the presence of the rowdy 
element and of the bully has often culminated in the with- 
drawal of the self-respecting child from the yards. In 
some cities, notably in New York, many public school 
buildings are open in the evenings, and boys and girls 
enjoy the opportunities afforded by the recreational facil- 
ities that are provided. The evening use of public school 
property is not only desirable, but in the near future will 
be required in the interests of social welfare. 
4. Tum Crvic Centers or CuHicaco. 
The most notable recreation center in the United States 
is the civic center of Chicago, which comprises a small 
park containing a finely equipped field house. The idea 
took form in 1903, when the South Park Commission of 
Chicago decided to establish a number of such centers 
on the south side of that city, and within four years ten 
civic centers were erected. A typical center is estab- 
lished at a cost of about $220,000, and the yearly cost of 
maintenance amounts to approximately $30,000. These 
centers comprise an area in some cases of ten acres each, 
and are therefore much larger than the ordinary play- 
ground for children. However, they do not confine their 
activities to the needs of children, and many adults par-
-P-A-G-E-116
  110 CHILD PROBLEMS 
ticipate in the advantages. They are located in regions 
badly in need of play facilities, and are therefore, with some 
exceptions, found in the poorer and more disagreeable 
parts of the South Side. 
The grounds were secured by direct purchase of the 
land ; buildings were removed and the parks and centers 
created. The grounds are inclosed, and contain various 
buildings and an exceedingly good equipment. A typical 
field house consists of a large assembly hall where enter- 
tainments of various kinds are continually held, and where 
dancing parties frequently convene; a boys’ gymnasium 
equipped for games, especially for basketball and for 
physical exercises; and a girls’ gymnasium in another 
part of the building, where the equipment is equally ade- 
quate. The building shelters one of the branches of the 
public library, and contains many clubrooms used by adult 
persons as well as by boys and girls. An indoor swimming 
pool is a valuable feature of the equipment, and a large 
pool is found just outside the building. This is used by 
males five days of the week, while on two days its use is 
limited to females. During the winter months facilities 
are provided for indoor play, but when good weather ap- 
proaches, the outdoor equipment is more generally utilized. 
The outdoor facilities consist of provisions for the little 
children, for a boys’ ground, and for a girls’ field. The 
portion allotted to the small child contains a wading pool 
absolutely safe, swings, teeter boards, and similar appa- 
ratus, as well as sand bins. Only children under ten years 
of age are allowed to use these grounds. Provision is made 
for the caretakers, who are supplied with ample shade 
while they watch the little ones. Mothers may come with 
their children and remain to see them play. The boys’ 
field is the largest area of the three divisions, but the patron- 
age is also the largest ; the field contains tennis grounds, 
a baseball diamond, an outdoor handball court, and 
 
-P-A-G-E-117
THE PLAYGROUND MOVEMENT 111 
apparatus adapted to the larger boy. A running track is 
usually included, and contests are a part of the regular 
program. In a few instances small ball grounds have 
been set apart for little boys, but the general rule is to 
admit all classes to the larger ball field. 
The girls’ field has the usual outdoor equipment, with 
opportunity for play and exercise. Even athletic contests 
for the girls and women have been inaugurated, and among 
the events are the running high jump, vertical ladder climb, 
and fifty-yard dash. Hundreds of girls participate in 
these contests—a fact which attests their popularity. 
When false modesty has subsided, their utility will also be 
generally recognized. 
A portion of the grounds is used in common, or for certain 
definite purposes. In winter part of the field is flooded 
and converted into a skating pond. A little dressing 
room is provided in a corner of the park, and serves as a 
starting point for the skaters. A number of tennis courts 
are located on this common field where the sexes may 
mingle in their play. A variety of sports are allowed, but 
baseball often preémpts this section of the grounds. The 
outdoor fields are open from May to November, but the 
indoor gymnasia are open throughout the year. 
5. PRoGRESS OF THE PLayarounD Movement. 
The rapid extension of playground facilities is being 
recognized as the most important phase of the playground 
problem. Types of playgrounds are of secondary value. 
Playgrounds may be both public and private. A large 
number are in fact being conducted by private societies, 
and it is the initiative of the latter which is responsible 
for much of the impetus given to the demands for play- 
grounds everywhere. The earlier playgrounds were almost 
entirely provided for by charitable and philanthropic 
societies. Social settlements started the movement in
-P-A-G-E-118
112 CHILD PROBLEMS 
  Chicago and in New York, but in all cases the interest 
of the municipalities was soon aroused and assistance was 
given to the movement. 
The city of Chicago excels at present in its playground 
facilities, and its ten recreation centers alone showed a 
record of attendance in 1907 of more than 5,000,000 persons. 
Adults, however, are included in this enumeration. The 
city has appropriated an additional $3,000,000 for the 
extension of its field houses to every part of the city in 
special need of such institutions. New York plans an 
extensive deyelopment of facilities, and in 1908 operated 
about 125 vacation playgrounds, 36 vacation schools, and 
81 evening recreation centers. The expenditure for the 
music furnished at the recreation piers exceeds $50,000 
for a season. In addition nearly $25,000 is spent for 
entertainment at the evening roof playgrounds. The ad- 
vantages thus furnished, however, accrue almost exclusively 
to adults. In 1907 only 66 cities had joined the play- 
ground movement, but in 1908 this number had grown to 
185, and an additional 118 other cities were contemplating 
the establishment of facilities for play. In 1909, 339 cities 
operated playgrounds. Thus a very rapid advance in the 
movement has occurred, and all of the larger cities are 
enlisted in the cause. In Missouri, the State University 
has carried on a propaganda through one of its departments 
and has succeeded in establishing playgrounds in more than 
30 cities in the state. Although no statistics are available 
showing the total number of playgrounds in the American 
cities, hundreds of them are now in existence. Several 
cities, notably Washington, Newark, and Rochester, have 
recently purchased considerable ground for the purpose 
of providing play facilities, and propose to establish an 
elaborate system of playgrounds. New Jersey, through 
state law, has authorized a playground commission for each 
one of its larger cities. The commission selects a site:for a
-P-A-G-E-119
      
   
     
   
           
   
    
   
      THE PLAYGROUND MOVEMENT 113 
playground, purchases the land, and organizes the work 
as fast as it is possible to secure appropriations for this 
purpose. Boston has also developed an extensive system, 
and has placed it in the hands of a school committee. In 
the South, Atlanta has responded to the need, and has 
appropriated a small sum to carry on a number of play- 
grounds. 
The success of the Chicago system of small parks and 
field houses has profoundly impressed students of the 
problem, and workers as well, and a tendency to imitate 
this plan is apparent. The systematic organization of the 
Chicago civic centers has also excited a wide-spread inter- 
est. There is still, however, a general belief in the ser- 
viceability of small playgrounds as found in the majority 
of cities. Social conditions must eventually determine 
which system is to be adopted by each particular city. 
6. Merruop or ADMINISTRATION. 
The importance of play, not as mere recreation, but as 
having a vigorous formative influence on the character 
and ideals of the child, has been recognized, and so the 
question how to make this influence most effective natu- 
rally arises. Shall play be supervised, or not? Wherever 
the park ideal of playground prevails, very little super- 
vision is possible. In the large park there is none, but in 
the small parks a system of limited supervision may exist. 
The results of the operation of the unsupervised playground 
have not been sufficiently encouraging to gain much sup- 
port for this method. In fact, the experience of the school 
playground, as well as the results in at least one city — 
Buffalo — contain a note of warning against this system. 
Consequently the recent tendency has been toward the 
ideal of the supervised playground. In the latter the 
bully and the gang can not rule and can not destroy the 
ethical values of play, nor can the larger boys monopolize 
I      
   
                 
     
-P-A-G-E-120
   
     
   114 CHILD PROBLEMS 
opportunity to the detriment of the smaller child. Un- 
questionably the supervised playground is superior in its 
capacity to develop the character and the social ideals of 
the child. The quality of the supervision is likewise a 
matter of utmost importance, especially to the boys. 
The success of supervision depends largely upon the 
efficiency of playground directors. These should be trained 
either in courses offered in connection with the department 
of physical education in our colleges or normal schools, or 
they should receive separate training in schools of social 
work. The public school teacher likewise should have 
a wider knowledge of the social aspects of play and educa- 
tion, so as to enable her to direct more efficiently the play 
of the children under her charge. 
Under an ideal arrangement playground facilities should 
be accessible throughout the year, but inclemency of 
weather makes outdoor sport in the small playgrounds 
and in the parks impossible during the winter months. 
The grounds, however, should be in use as long as the con- 
ditions of the weather allow. In the majority of Ameri- 
can cities this is about seven months. Indoor equipment 
is important, and this problem is partially met by the 
Chicago recreation centers, which make provision during 
the winter for all classes except the small children. Every- 
where the vacation playground must have its functions 
enlarged and the time of operation extended so that the 
child may continually be provided with the opportunity 
to play. 
Shall small parks, playgrounds, and recreation centers 
be controlled by the board of education or by some other 
department of the city government? This question re- 
ceives various answers, but the concensus of opinion is 
slowly crystallizing in favor of control by some special 
bureau or department. According to this arrangement, 
parks, all forms of recreation centers, swimming pools, 
 
-P-A-G-E-121
THE PLAYGROUND MOVEMENT 115 
and public baths are placed under the charge of the same 
branch of the municipal government. In favor of this 
plan it is argued that the facilities for (play are not con- 
fined to school children and that the functions of the parks 
are much broader, granting privileges and opportunities 
as they do to many classes, and permitting enjoyment 
to all through the variety of activities allowefl. Accord- 
ingly this work is outside the scope of the duties of a board 
of education. Furthermore the latter does not have charge 
of all matters affecting children, but of a few of their prob- 
lems only. If everything relating to childhood were 
brought under the jurisdiction of the school authorities, 
the supervision of playgrounds might also be included. 
But this is far from the actual condition. Again, the close 
relation to each other of the members of this group of 
activities naturally suggests their inclusion under a single 
administrator. 
On the other hand, it is claimed that the board of edu- 
cation is the proper authority under which all playgrounds 
should be placed, because play is essentially educational 
and social in its nature. Although the playground move- 
ment began apart from the public school, there is an iden- 
tity of interest which justifies the control of play facilities 
by the educational authorities. The control of this ac- 
tivity should not be divided between two departments, 
as it would be if the board of education retained control 
of the school playgrounds and all other playgrounds were 
subjected to some alien authority. Therefore an extension 
of the administrative functions of the board seems ad- 
visable. Furthermore, a propaganda supported by the 
combined influence of the educational forces of a city is 
more likely to secure the facilities for which the public 
contends. It has been the policy of the American boards 
to extend their functions and enlarge their duties as need 
for these changes has developed. -. ‘

  116 CHILD PROBLEMS 
In actual practice a diversity of method still prevails. 
The vacation schools, playgrounds, and recreation centers 
of New York City are directly under the control of its 
board of education. In Boston, likewise, the school board 
has charge of all playgrounds, both those in the parks and 
in the school yards. This city may, however, soon create 
a new municipal department which will have charge of the 
playgrounds as well as of other activities. The fine recrea- 
tion centers of Chicago are under the supervision of a park 
commission, and in St. Louis the control is vested in a 
similar municipal body. The divergent methods of con: 
trol which characterize the large cities is equally reflected 
among the smaller ones. Opinion and method, however, 
is nearly unanimous in favor of the continued control of 
the school playground by the board of education. As the 
ideals of our people develop and the urgency of recreation 
centers for all classes is generally accepted, playgrounds 
for children will be regarded as a mere ramification of a 
fixed social program. It is likely that our cities, when 
dominated by this point of view, will gradually subject 
the public playground facilities to the control of some 
appropriate municipal body other than the school board. 
This seems to be the logical development.

  CHAPTER III 
THE MEDICAL INSPECTION OF SCHOOLS 
1. Turory or INSPECTION. 
The right of the child to health must hereafter be re- 
. garded as a fundamental claim upon society. This claim 
depends upon two important considerations: first, the 
inability of the child to realize the permanent disadvan- 
tage which ill health may entail upon him; second, the 
failure of ignorant parents to care for their children in a 
proper manner. The health interests of the child have 
received due recognition only since children~have_ been 
congregated in our schoolrooms. Accordingly the medi- 
cal inspection of children has taken the form of inspection 
of school children. The scope of inspection naturally 
depends upon the purpose of the work, and will vary in 
extensiveness according to the theory held in regard to the 
basic grounds for inspection of the schools. 
The earlier theory advanced in justification of the medi- 
cal inspection of school children was that such inspection 
falls within the police power of the state. The right of the 
government to safeguard public health by suppressing 
contagion warrants, not only the enactment of quarantine 
laws and the establishment of pesthouses, but also the 
creation of medical inspectors for the public schools; for 
the schoolroom is the ideal place for the rapid diffusion 
of epidemics — the clearing-house for all the contagious 
diseases of the community. To this theory the first medi- 
eal inspection of the schools is to be credited. Europe 
117

   CHILD PROBLEMS 
he way, several German cities adopting a system of 
yection in 1867. The movement began in Austria in 
8, in Belgium in 1874, and in France in 1884.1 This 
early inspection was practically restricted, of course, to the 
detection of contagious diseases. The beginning of the sys- 
tem in the United States was characterized by similar 
limitations. In New York City, inspection was at first 
confined to sixteen different diseases; the number was 
later reduced to seven of the most malignant of these dis- 
eases. ‘ 
The second theory of the right of inspection is the one 
upon which the most modern methods of social and philan- . 
thropic work are based. According ¢o this theory, society 
is bound not only to employ measures for its own defense, 
but also to initiate constructive methods for the purpose 
of ameliorating conditions for the coming generation. 
The new theory is, in short, an outlook into the future. 
The motto of the present-day social worker is that no con- 
dition which imperils the welfare of the individual is to be 
ignored unless the disadvantages of interference outweigh 
the value of remedial service. Hence the examination of 
school children for contagious:diseases is but part of the 
work, and medical inspection is extended to the detection 
of mental and physical defects and the minor diseases of 
the child. Philanthropic workers have not until recently 
begun to appreciate the importance of a complete system 
of inspection. This seemed to call for an unjustifiable 
interference with the personal liberty of the American — 
people. Happily, silly sentiment regarding this liberty 
is rapidly giving way to wholesome policies of social reform 
which are destined to remove the causes of individual 
inefficiency and to increase the ability of the poor to become 
self-supporting.

2. Nature or INSPECTION. 
Tn the inspection of children, the following points should 
be considered : — 
a.- Disease® of every description, especially. contagious 
and infectious cases. 
b. Mental defects. Backward children need most care- 
ful diagnosis in order to effect such segregation as may be 
necessary for their educational interests, as well as to as- 
certain the precise nature of their defects, which may often 
be remediable. 
c. Defective sense organs. A very large group of chil- 
dren is suffering from ‘defective eyesight, of which the prin- 
cipal forms are shortsightedness and focal inequalities. 
The pupils should have their attention called to these 
defects, and the parents should be requested to remedy 
them. Delay may lead to such defective vision as would 
handicap in a most serious manner the industrial efficiency 
of the child. Again, deafness is often the cause of the 
teacher’s failure to understand the child. Backwardness 
is often occasioned by the absence of methods which will 
give the child the greatest measure of opportunity possible. 
d. Other physical defects. Stammering requires atten- 
tion, and rules for its treatment should be given. Defects 
of the teeth are more common than any other physical 
jsubnormalities of the child. Such defects, although slight 
in their incipient stages, need attention not only on ac- 
count of the subsequent results, but also because of the 
tendency of the child to neglect the care of the teeth. 
Adenoids and affections of the throat afflict large numbers 
of children, and are therefore an important item in the work 
of the inspector. Adenoids may be relieved by an opera- 
tion that can be performed by the school physician. Medi- 
cal inspection will bring to light a multitude of other com- 
, plaints, ailments, and physical deformities. The nervous,
-P-A-G-E-126
ee pe * 
120 CHILD PROBLEMS 
respiratory, and circulatory systems all stand in need 
of careful examination. The defects and diseases sepa- 
rately named above are, however, of prime importance, and 
should be given precedence in the work of inspection. 
3. OrganizaTION oF ScHooL INSPECTION. - 
The organization of the work requires the active co- 
operation of several classes of officials, chief among which 
are the school nurses and the physicians or medical inspec- 
tors. The teacher and the parents are also very necessary 
adjuncts. To secure adequate relief it is necessary in the 
large cities to obtain the codperation of family physicians, 
and, in some cases, of suitable dispensaries. Whether 
medical inspection of the schools should be a function of 
the board of health or of the board of education is a mooted 
question. The health departments wish to obtain juris- 
diction over the health of the school children, while boards 
of education claim that the work is only a special applica- 
tion of their own powers. The detection of contagious 
diseases is a necessary part of the work of the health depart- 
ment, and the danger of epidemics makes watchfulness on 
its part absolutely necessary. Compulsory vaccination, 
effectual quarantine, and other precautionary measures 
have been established by this department, and the logical 
development of its work carries it into the school to detect 
evidences of contagion there. The work has simply be- 
come positive instead of remaining negative as it formerly 
was. The bar to contagion is easy if access to the probable 
agents of an epidemic can be gained in time. It would 
seem, therefore, that the health bureau has a claim to the 
right to superintend the work of medical inspection of the 
schools. 
The board of education, on the other hand, contends 
that the Geplth, cleanliness, and physical condition of the 
   
-P-A-G-E-127

child are, apart from the presence of contagious disease, 
closely bound up with his school work, and that therefore 
the best results can be achieved only by placing the medical 
inspectors under_its direction, (Che chief demands made 
upon the school physician are the adaptation of the pupil 
to the conditions of the school and the removal of minor 
defects) _The achievement of these results means increased 
capacity of the child to accomplish the work of the school- 
room. The great proportion of the inspector’s work is 
more closely allied to the natural functions of the teacher 
than to those of the representative of the bureau of health. 
fective vision, deafness, backwardness, and subnormal 
physical development directly affect capacity for education 
and determine the methods of instruction that should be 
applied. Accordingly the board of education considers 
medical inspection a mere extension of the work of its 
hygiene and physical exercise departments. s 
In actual practice nearly all of the large cities of the 
United States are doing the work under the supervision 
of their health departments. Boards of health acted be- 
fore the educational departments began the work; hence 
medical inspection is almost entirely in the hands of the 
former wherever very active care of the conditions of 
public health has been necessary. These boards are 
naturally loath to relinquish the work which they have 
undertaken, and thus occasion jealousy if not animosity 
on the part of the boards of education. New Orleans 
and St. Louis are the only large cities in which educa- 
tional authorities control the work of inspection. The 
tendency, however, is toward the increased power of the 
boards of education and the surrender to them of at least 
a portion of these duties. 
In a few cities the work is done conjointly by the two 
boards, but this system tends to create confusion and 
endangers the efficiency of the inspection, and especially 
 
-P-A-G-E-128
Te ee 
122 CHILD PROBLEMS 
of the remedial work which follows and which gives value 
to the examination of the child. Joint responsibility is 
not proving successful because of the friction which it 
engenders and the consequent impossibility of securing 
the best results. Most of the remedial work and the 
statistical tabulations, including the keeping of records, 
will in either case remain a part of the task of the school 
authorities. Therefore it seems clear that the interests 
of the child will be better subserved by placing the in- 
spectors under the control of the board of education. 
Regular reports, however, must be made to the board of 
health to enable the latter to perform its legitimate duties 
and safeguard the public health. The handling of the 
problem of contagious diseases must remain with the 
board of health. 
4. Tue Menicat Inspector. 
Gach inspector should have assigned to him about four 
schools, all of which should be visited in the routine of his 
work) At stated intervals(it should be the duty of the 
inspector to examine every child in each school) Such 
examination should be thorough, according to the method 
of several German cities. \[t should in the first place cover 
all minor defects, then the general physical constitution, 
chest measurement, weight, height, condition of the skin, 
spine, eyelids, sense organs, etc., should be carefully noted 
and recorded\, The information thus obtained would be 
useful for both immediate and comparative purposes, and 
should furnish the basis for a constructive program of 
physical development. The daily visit to a school should 
be for the purpose of understanding the graver ailments 
of the child. A clinic or examination room should be pro- 
vided, and only such children should be sent to the inspec- 
tor as require examination. The principal matters of 
interest should be: the detection of contagious diseases
-P-A-G-E-129
THE MEDICAL INSPECTION OF SCHOOLS 123 
and the exclusion from school of the affected children ; 
the inspection of children who have returned to school after 
exclusion on account of disease or other cause; also the 
examination of those who have been recently treated and 
of those who are plainly in need of treatment. Suspicious 
cases should always be referred to the inspector by the 
teacher or by the trained nurse. Parents should be noti- 
fied or children be referred to appropriate places for treat- 
ment. 
In some instances it will be necessary for the physician 
to follow the child into the home, but this task should 
usually belong to the school nurse. Treatment by the 
physician in the home will not be welcomed by the medi- 
eal fraternity, which depends for its subsistence upon the 
fees received from private practice. It is well at the present 
time not to interfere too seriously with the work of the 
practicing physician, although means must be provided 
for those who are unable to command the private ser- 
vices of a physician. 
5. Tue Scuoot Nurss. 
The great burden of the remedial work required in our 
schools rests upon the school nurse. Her duties should 
consist briefly of the following tasks : — 
a. The treatment of the minor cased which the medical 
inspector orders sent to her. These linclude numerous 
skin diseases, some of which may be contagious; cuts, 
sprains ; certain affections of the eye, ate. 
b. Instruction in regard to pediculosis and the nature 
of the home treatment required. 
c. The detection of minor_cases of disease among the 
pupils and the summary exclusion of cases showing symp- 
toms of a serious contagious diseas¢. 
d. Visits to the home to advise parents as to methods 
of treatment and when necessary to impress upon them 
mA 
 
-P-A-G-E-130
  124 CHILD PROBLEMS 
the need of medical attention) In some cities the nurses 
frequently attend the child to the hospital or dispensary. 
e. fhe keeping of records showing the physical con- 
dition ‘of the child) Besides these general duties, sub- 
sidiary ones are common. In Philadelphia, for example, 
the nurses have excluded a large number of children on 
account of unsatisfactory vaccination. Underfed and 
dirty children also receive the nurses’ attention. 
The school nurse handles about five schools and visits 
each one every day, but can not make detailed examinations 
on each visit. The treatment of cases requires much time, 
and an enormous amount of work must be done. A single 
nurse in Philadelphia during one year treated 8600 cases, 
cured 993, made 884 visits to homes and 212 visits to 
dispensaries. The work of the nurses in that city within 
a short time reduced pediculosis 73 per cent and provided 
many children with eyeglasses who would otherwise have 
ruined their eyes. The principal ailments with which the 
school nurse has to deal in the large cities are, in the order 
of their importance: pediculosis, eye disease, and ring- 
worm. A large group of other defects must before long 
be given the careful attention of the school nurse; the 
most important of these is defective vision, then follow 
bad teeth, imperfect hearing, and various other defects. 
The function of the school nurse is a most important 
one. She is more valuable to the child than any other 
part of the system of medical inspection. She prepares 
the pupil for a more intelligent care of himself, interests 
him in hygienic methods and cleanliness, and teaches his 
parents both how to care for their child and the need of 
giving him their attention. By her promptness she saves 
much valuable time to the school child, who can not well 
afford to be excluded from school for any length of time. 
She must havea strong but gentle personality, as her success 
depends not upon her powers of compulsion but upon her 
persuasive influence.
-P-A-G-E-131
  
  THE MEDICAL INSPECTION OF SCHOOLS 125 
6. Tue TEACHER. 
The teacher forms an essential part of the system of 
medical inspection. Her alert eye must be ever ready to 
distinguish the suspicious case. She must codperate with 
the nurse ,and inspector and put their suggestions into 
practice. (Tests of vision and hearing are in some states 
made by the teachers themselves) and in Massachusetts 
such tests are made when recommended by specialists. 
The teacher is in close touch with the pupil, the tests are 
comparatively simple, competency to conduct them is 
soon acquired, and the resulting disclosures make the 
teacher more diligent in her attention to defects in the 
physical equipment of the school. On the other hand, 
examination of the children by a specialist carries more 
weight with the parents upon whom falls the final duty 
of supplying the children’s needs. In those states and 
cities in which no comprehensive medical inspection as 
yet obtains, (the duty of the teacher to make these tests, 
inform the parents, and, remedy the defects as best she 
can is absolutely clear. hen medical inspection has been 
officially introduced, it may not be necessary for the teacher 
to attend to the work herself’) 
7.. Tae Scuoot CHIL. 
In any large city the danger from contagion is consid- 
erable. Children who have been infected with disease 
infect others, and, unless strict precautions are = 
epidemics may follow. Serious epidemics, howev: 
are less common than the minor ailments and defects of 
children. From twelve to sixteen contagious diseases 
usually comprise the list of diseases for which children 
are excluded. The defects which come under the care of 
the nurse are much more numerous, and it is the inclusion 
of these which swells the total number of defective children. 
 
-P-A-G-E-132
  126 CHILD PROBLEMS 
There are very few perfect children, and in some schools 
the thorough physician will find that every child suffers 
from some defect, trivial though it may be. The number 
of defective school children in the United States has been 
estimated as comprising from about two thirds to three 
fourths of the entire number of school children, but these 
estimates include all those afflicted with minor defects, 
such as bad teeth, etc. It is not likely that each one of these 
deficiencies would seriously handicap the child, although 
treatment would be an advantage. The advisability of 
removing all defects in our school children is entirely clear, 
but no occasion for serious alarm has as yet presented 
itself. The proportion of defectiveness is greatly reduced 
when the minor defects are excluded. 
8. Lacat Proviston ror Mepicat INsPEcTIoN. 
Once begun, the movement in the United States in favor 
of medical inspection has advanced very rapidly. A 
large number of our cities have provided for inspection 
in some form. Boston was the first large city to adopt 
it officially. The work began there in 1894 and is under 
the control of the board of health. Chicago followed the 
next year, the bureau of health providing for a limited 
inspection. Later the work there was practically aban- 
doned for ten years, and only recommenced in 1906. Phil- 
adelphia began the work with an insufficient corps of 
physicians and a nurse borrowed from the Visiting Nurse 
Association of the city. The latter city now has five nurses, 
but more are needed to meet the demands of the city. New 
York City has 166 physicians and 50 nurses at the present 
time, yet the combined efforts of so many physicians and 
nurses have been unable to cover adequately all the schools 
of the city. The example of these large cities operates to 
create general sentiment in favor of the movement, and 
many smaller cities have begun to make provision for
-P-A-G-E-133
  THE MEDICAL INSPECTION OF SCHOOLS 127 
eee 
medical inspection by appointing physicians to take charge* 
of the examinations. Nor has the movement been con- 
fined to the cities. Several states have passed laws on the 
subject. Connecticut enjoys the priority by having 
passed its laws in 1899, but these laws provide only for 
eye tests. Vermont and Massachusetts have followed, 
and include among their requirements inspection for both 
contagious and non-contagious diseases. New Jersey has 
authorized medical inspection, but as the law is not manda- 
tory, good results must await the development of public 
opinion. In many of the states the growing demand for 
attention to the defects of the children has caused the state 
board of health to advise or require that inspection for 
certain defects be made. In many places the subject is 
under discussion, and several states will beyond doubt add 
provisions in the near future for the inspection of all 
school children within their respective borders.

  CHAPTER IV 
THE EDUCATION OF BACKWARD CHILDREN 
1. Inrropvuction. 
In recent years we have begun to realize that a consid- 
erable number of our children, notably the dull and back- 
ward pupils, are not receiving justice at the hands of our 
public schools. By “backward child” is meant neither 
the idiot nor the imbecile, but the child who is slightly 
deficient mentally. He who is behind his classes because 
illness or absence from school is not properly included. 
he backward child is one who can not keep up with the 
normal pupil, who is not sufficiently defective to belong 
in an institution, but who requires special care and atten- 
tion) He is educable to a greater or less degree, and re- 
sponds favorably to the right kind of training, but is com- 
monly from two to five years below grade. The child 
slightly defective physically has received more attention in 
the public school than the mentally slow or dull one. In 
modern schools the pupil with _poor-eyesight is given a 
front-seat, the one with defective hearing is brought within 
range of the teacher’s voice, the one with-weak-heart or 
lungs is given concessions_in regard -to-marehing, climbing 
stairs, etc., and is exempt from difficult-gymnasium—work. 
But it is only in recent years and in a few places that the 
dull child has been segregated under special training, that 
is, in special classes doing the regular grade work but in 
smaller quantities and with longer periods of time. 
128
-P-A-G-E-135
   EDUCATION OF BACKWARD CHILDREN 129 
2. Numper or BackwarD CHILDREN. 
In 1906, in the annual report of the Superintendent of 
Schools of New York City, more than 30 per cent of the 
children were reported above normal age. This, however, 
has little significance for the country in general when one 
considers the number of immigrant children-in New York 
handicapped by lack of knowledge of the English language. 
Professor Monroe of Stanford University gathered par- 
ticulars of 10,000 children in the public schools of Cali- 
fornia, and claims to have found about 10 per cent dull or 
backward, and about 3 per cent feeble-minded. Dr. Fran- 
cis Warner, member of the Royal Commission of Blind, 
Deaf, etc., having investigated 100,000 English school chil- 
dren, found 7 per cent dull and 1.6 per cent feeble-minded. 
‘In London alone there are 8000 deficient children... These 
figures indicate rates much higher than those discovered 
by most investigators of the subject in the United States. 
The Committee on Backward Children of Philadelphia 
estimates the number of these children at 1 per cent of 
the school population. This seems somewhat lower than 
the general average, but is, at least, a very conservative 
estimate. 
The Census of 1900 reported that 13,178,900 children 
between the ages of five and twenty years were attending 
school! By taking 1 per cent of this number we have 
131,789 “backward children” in schools in the United 
States in 1900. In 1908 this number has no doubt in- 
creased to approximately 200,000. Many backward chil- 
dren drop out. of school;. therefore the aggregate number 
must be considerably larger than the figures just given. 
The question of proper instruction, then, is of sufficient 
importance to merit agitation and action.

3. Causes or Menta DULLNESS. 
(re most commonly admitted causes of mental dullness 
are defective eyesight and hearing, adenoids, and_ throat 
disorders.) The investigation of the special sense organs 
of childrén was begun years ago, but has only recently been 
practically applied.. In Germany, Dr. Cohn found that 
in the lower grades 22 per cent had defective eyesight ; 
in the upper grades 58 per cent; in Sweden, Axel Key 
found only 6 per cent at eleven years of age, but 37 per cent 
at twenty years. In the United States defective eyesight 
affects about 20 per cent of the school children. Defects 
in hearing are somewhat less common. The percentages 
range about as follows: Germany, 30 per cent; France, 
17 per cent; England, 27 per cent; Russia, 21 per cent ; 
United States, 5 to 6 per cent. It is well understood that 
the visual and auditory sensations are closely related to 
the activities of the mind; furthermore, that eye strain 
and overtaxed attention act directly upon the nervous 
system, exhausting it and making the child irritable as 
well as incapable of normal mental activity. Mr. Dawson! 
says that no type of the commoner physical defects of 
childhood has quite so stupefying an effect upon the men- 
tal life as have the nose and throat affections. Out of 
99,240 children examined in New York City in 1905, 
18,131, or 18 per cent, had enlarged tonsils; and- 10 per 
cent had adenoid growths, many of them with accompany- 
ing affections of ears, nose, lungs, and impairment of health 
and. mental vigor. 
/ Another great cause of slow mentality is the low con- 
dition of the nervous system This is again correlated 
with arrested physical growth, deformities, ete.’ Dr. 
Francis Warner studied 50,000 London school children, 
1 Dawson, George, Physical Study of the Child, National Conference of 
Charities and Correction, 1907.

and found that 9 per cent of them showed abnormal nerve 
conditions. These were usually associated with physical 
defects, with low nutrition and mental dullness. It is now 
generally conceded that the latest acquired characteristics 
are the most unstable ; consequently the first to be affected 
by poor physical conditions. Very naturally, then, the 
cerebrum, and the mind as well as the entire nervous 
system, are early affected by arrested physical develop- 
ment. Spargo claims that “low nutrition is the prime 
and most fruitful cause of mental dullness.” However, 
this is an ultimate rather than an immediate cause. Mal- 
nutrition is often a cause of poor physical condition or 
arrested development, which in turn is a cause of low 
mentality. 
Gulick and Ayres have brought out some evidence show- 
ing that while physical defects are “a cause they are not 
the cause of retardation,” and that possibly this side of 
the question had been overestimated in recent years.! In 
May and June, 1908, these two authors made an investi- 
gation of children from fifteen schools of New York City. 
Seven thousand six hundred and eight pupils were exam- 
ined physically. Nearly 80 per cent of the normal age 
children had physical defects, while only 75 per cent of 
the over-age children were physically defective! It is 
shown, however, that children outgrow their defects and 
that the percentages given merely indicate, as is self-evi- 
dent, that those above normal age are older than the other 
children in their grade and so naturally have fewer defects. 
But for the backward children the presence of physical 
defects is a more serious matter. In all, 1012 atypical 
children, four fifths of whom were ten years of age or over, 
were examined. Of this number, 60 per cent were suffer- 
ing from malnutrition, 78 per cent from nervous disorders,

tardation and Physical Defects.

56 per cent from adenoid growths, 60 per cent from hyper- 
trophied tonsils, 69 per cent from defective vision, 30 per 
cent from defective hearing, and 80 per cent from defective 
teeth. A majority of these children had numerous defects, 
and malnutrition was plainly one of the important causes 
of their mental retardation. 
cause of continued defect is the discouragement that 
comes when slightly deficient, children try to keep up with 
brighter schoolmates and fail.) Since they can not receive 
special attention, they lose courage and fall farther behind. 
Absence from school for whatever reason is probably the 
most common cause of retardation. While this is not 
strictly backwardness, it often appears so, and when suffi- 
ciently pronounced amounts to the same thing, because the 
child lacking early training is not so apt and active in 
mind as is the normal child. 
4. OricIn AND Resutts or THE Work ABRoap. 
In the establishment of special classes for mentally 
deficient children, Germany was the pioneer, and began 
the work in 1867. Norway followed in 1874, and England, 
Switzerland, and Austria in 1892. In Prussia since 1880 
special schools or classes for defectives have been required 
in all cities having a population of 20,000 or more. In 
some cases Germany has special schools, in others, special 
classes for these children. In 1901 at the Congress on the 
Education of Feeble-Minded Children at Augsburg, 98 
day schools — in all 326 classes — were reported. This 
meant 7013 children in attendance. All were not provided 
for, however, and had the provision been adequate, 60,000 
“special class” children should have been reported. Ger- 
man experience has shown that about 83 per cent of these 
children are able at the end of school age to secure employ- 
ment requiring little skill, and can in time support them- '

selves wholly or in part. The care of the remaining 17 
per cent is more of a problem, and without doubt the ma- 
jority should be transferred to institutions before the end 
of their school age. 
England opened her first special class in 1892. In 1907 
London had 60 schools accommodating 3000 pupils. Eng- 
land estimates the cost of training in special classes as 
twice that in the ordinary grades. In Birmingham, where 
an after-care committee has kept careful record of pupils 
of special classes, 26 out of the 83 cases followed have been 
“ reported as wage-earners, but only a small percentage of 
these were self-supporting. About 38 per cent seemed 
“to require permanent protection and at least partial sup- 
port. In England, however, a lower grade of children 
_ than those accepted in the United States has been included 
in the category of backward children. 
5. Work IN THE UNITED Sratzs. 
In the United States, Providence, Rhode Island, first 
took up this work. In 1893 three schools for special dis- 
cipline and instruction were “organized and made a part 
of the public school system.” Backward children were 
tried in these disciplinary schools, but it was soon dis- 
covered that treatment suited to “active mischievous boys” 
was not suited to “feeble plodding children.’ Accord- 
ingly in 1896 a special class for the latter was opened. A 
second was added in 1897, and a third in 1898. Out of 
eighty-two children in these classes, between 1896 and 
1900, five were returned to regular schools, seven were 
sent to the disciplinary schools, and sixteen over fifteen 
years of age were earning part or all of their living. 
With five exceptions, all had improved, some of them 
to a marked degree. The first class in Boston began 
work in 1899. In 1907 seven special classes containing
-P-A-G-E-140

134 CHILD PROBLEMS 
95 children were reported. This was out of a school 
population of 82,378. The Boston Committee on the 
Health of Children in their report for the same year 
recommended more special classes, especially in the first 
three grades. 
In 1899 the Public Education Association and the Civic 
Club of Philadelphia first agitated for that city the ques- 
tion of special provision for defective children. The same 
year the Philadelphia School for Backward Children was 
organized. After two years the work was taken over by 
the Board of Education. In 1906 there were nine classes 
for boys and one for girls. Although in separate classes, 
the backward children were in the same building with the _ 
classes for truants and incorrigibles. In New York more 
ample provision is made for dull and backward children, and 
special classes have been instituted for over-aged, non- 
English speaking, and below-grade pupils. The atypical 
or mentally backward children are placed in “ungraded 
classes.””! In 1908, 61 such classes were in operation, with a 
total registration of 1012 pupils. During the yearmorethan 
2000 children were specially examined for the purpose of 
ascertaining the grade of their mental defectiveness and the 
desirability of assigning them to these classes, Of this 
number, 1084 were recommended for the ungraded work. 
In St. Louis there are at present seven special schools, 
each having two classes of about fifteen pupils per class. 
The great difficulty here is the presence in the same class of 
mental defectives, moral defectives, slow pupils, and nor- 
mal children handicapped by lack of language, etc. The 
work is so new in St. Louis that much remains to be done 
in the way of classifying and segregating as well as of pro- 
viding more classes. The schools, as far as situation, en- 
vironment, condition of buildings, etc., are concerned, are

City, p. 112.

excellent. In a number of other cities special work for 
backward children has been introduced, but the examples 
given illustrate the nature and trend of the work in the 
United States. 
6. Nereps or BACKWARD CHILDREN. 
The presence of the backward child in the ordinary 
schoolroom is a distinct disadvantage to every one in the 
room. The teacher is not so much concerned over spend- 
ing some of her valuable time with the slow pupils as she 
is with the problem of what is to be done with the 30 or 40 
normal children meanwhile. There is an inevitable inter- 
ruption, school discipline suffers, interest wavers, and 
work drags every time these backward children try to 
recite. The ordinary grade teacher is kept busy with 
the regular work. The consequence is that, because the 
greatest good to the greatest number must be chosen when 
time is limited, the backward child does not receive the 
help he needs. The work goes too fast for his slower 
mind to follow, he becomes confused and disheartened, and 
loses all interest in school. Very probably he grows to 
hate the work he can never succeed in doing as other chil- 
dren do. Then follows the discouragement of parents, 
the removal from school, and the child is permanently 
deprived of the education he so sorely needs. To become 
self-supporting, or even to become able to contribute toward 
that end, requires that such a child be patiently and care- 
fully trained. If this is not done, a tendency to drift into 
crime and to swell our prison and reformatory population 
is inevitable. ) In nearly all institutions of this kind there 
is a large percentage whom those in charge recognize as 
mentally deficient, yet they have been tried and sentenced 
in exactly the same way as though they had been nor- 
mally responsible. If they could have been taken in the 
“hopeful years of three to thirteen” and helped and taught  
-P-A-G-E-142
-136 CHILD PROBLEMS 
in special classes, they might have become at least partially 
self-supporting ; or even if their support must have de- 
volved upon the state, they might have been placed in 
institutions before they turned to evil and to crime. 
One of the most pressing needs of backward children 
is medical attention.) If the physical defects which are so 
ofteh the cause of their dullness were removed or treated, 
the backwardness itself would often vanish) However, 
public opinion has as yet failed to demand nfedical atten- 
tion in most schools, and in some instances wrong ways of 
agitating the question have prejudiced people against the 
movement. (Classes of backward children should have 
nurses assigned.to them so that hygienic and medical needs 
~ may be carefully attended to) The physique of each child 
must be carefully built up. Defects should be removed or 
remedied and wholesome nutrition provided. Experience 
in New York City has demonstrated that when properly 
fed, backward children have achieved wonderful progress. 
Another great need of successful work in thiseline is a 
better method of transferal from the ordinary grades and 
the removal of very deficient pupils. Both improvements 
require the advice of a medical inspector. The removal 
of the child from his grade should follow one or two failures, 
provided, of course, that there has not been some valid 
reason for his defection. Germany has a wise system of 
admission to special classes. If after several trials children 
fail to advance with the regular grades, they are visited 
in their homes and then sent to the special classes on trial. 
After a few weeks a committee, consisting of inspector, 
school doctor, and teacher, pass upon their fitness to 
reyhain. 
f, after a fair chance, backward children fail to respond 
to special class instruction, \they should be placed in insti- 
tutions ir_places given to others who might profit 
by the opportunity, In order to make a success of special 
 
-P-A-G-E-143
ne 
EDUCATION OF BACKWARD CHILDREN 137 
classes, there must be room enough in institutions to ac- 
commodate those who can not be kept in the classes. Just 
as the dull child must be taken from the regular grades, 
so the feeble-minded child must be taken from the special 
classes. He is the same menace there that the backward 
child is in the ordinary schoolroom. 
ost especially do these children need kindly, patient, 
whble-hearted women as teachers) The German system, 
while excellent in many ways, endseaaed by its choice 
of teachers. These are men, and they are usually without 
special training, being chosen on the basis of aptitude for 
the work. It seems that here if anywhere is woman’s 
field. Besides, training of teachers is absolutely essen- 
tial! As Dr. Johnstofe says, “What we need is forward 
teachers for backward pupils.” ‘‘ After-care Committees,” 
such as have been organized in England and elsewhere, 
are extremely important. They aim to keep a friendly 
eye on defective children who have left the special classes, 
and to ffde them across from school to life. 
7. ORGANIZATION OF SPECIAL CLASSES. 
Most large cities have decided that classes need to be 
situated in separate buildings so as to remove them from 
all association, on the playground and elsewhere, with 
ordinary pupils, and so shield them not only from ridicule 
but also from the worry and strain likely to result from 
such association. These severely handicapped children 
will do better if associated only with their teachers and with 
other pupils whose powers are more nearly like their own. 
The environment of these schools should be cheerful, sani- 
tary, and helpful at all times. Sufficient yard space, as 
well as a well-appointed interior, should be secured. There 
1 A few institutions, such nat the New Jersey Training School for Feeble- 
Minded Boys and Girls, have been giving short summer courses for 
teachers who intend to take charge of special classes.
-P-A-G-E-144
EE 
138 CHILD PROBLEMS 
should be a supervisor of special class work, who should 
have general supervision and assist teachers in arranging 
courses: and planning the work and in settling special 
problems. In number the class should not exceed fifteen, 
as each pupil needs individual attention and care, and 
such classes can not be well graded. The best plan in 
large cities would be to have three or more classes in one 
center. This would allow a saving in material equipment, 
as well as make a slight gradation possible. 
the work done in the classes should be a combination 
of mental, moral, and physical training.) Most. classes 
base their teaching on the theory that physiological train- 
ing of the hand arouses action in the brain; hence the 
emphasis put upon manual training, such as sloyd, clay 
modeling, basket-weaving, sewing, raffia work, etc., and 
cooking, laundrying, and general housework for the girls. 
Another aim of manual training is to create a love of work 
and so give an ambition to be self-supporting rather than 
dependent.' In many schools special emphasis is laid on 
1 Miss Chase gives an interesting account of the manual work done 
by the somewhat noted class of Miss Elizabeth Farrell on the lower East 
Side in New York City. This class consisted usually of from 18 to 20 
boys, ranging in age from six and one half to seventeen years. Miss 
Chase says, “They always have some subject as a center ; at present it is 
the farm. In wood-work they are making a house and a barn, fences, fur- 
niture, and flower-boxes. They are weaving the rugs for the floor, doing 
raffia work and basketry. They went to the country for the soil to plant 
their miniature fields, and sent to Washington forthe seeds. In painting, 
their subjects have been apple-blossoms and violets with an illustrated 
trip to Bronx Park. In picture study, they have taken ‘Oxen Plowing,’ 
“The Angelus,’ etc. In arithmetic, the older boys measure, in a concrete 
way, the rooms of the house and the fields. In their written work in 
English, they are having stories of farm life, and reports of personal ob- 
servation; in reading, stories of dogs, horses, making hay, and so on; 
in spelling, words relating to manual occupations, e.g., soil, seed, leaves, 
barn. In nature work, they are studying soils, the earthworm, buds, 
and seeds. This is simply suggestive of the excellent work that the boys 
are taking up at present. The subjects are chosen and the different 
studies related to the center with the purpose of developing the social

games, and the children ere tecnts how to play. Instruc- 
tion in the usual school branches is quite elementary, and 
is sometimes a form of kindergarten instruction. Super- 
intendent Soldan of St. Louis, who was intensely inter- 
ested in this subject, and who gave his last living thoughts 
to the question, said that much should be made of singing, 
that music possessed a great power over the mental defec- 
tive, and that the learning and memorizing of good songs 
would be beneficial. He thought much attention should 
be given to the spoken language ; to memorizing; to read- 
ing and spelling; to writing by muscular movement; to 
the manual activities; and that general information in 
science, geography, and history should be regularly given as 
it proved serviceable. The children should he interested in 
plants and animals and gather knowledge about them. A 
measure of advancement can in this way be accomplished. 
Everywhere it should be borne in mind that much 
mental achievement must not be expected of these chil- 
dren. ti they can be made self-supporting and self-con- 
trolling, very much has been done to lighten the burden 
of society and to ease the social conscience in regard to its 
duty to these handicapped children) Furthermgre the

CHAPTER V 
THE NEW EDUCATION 
1. Lrrerary Epucation. 
Education has long since been recognized as an indis- 
pensable accompaniment of effective citizenship. Accord- 
ingly very few children escape an elementary education 
of some kind. The public school is such a fundamental 
American institution that it has reached out and com- 
prehended almost the entire school population. As a 
factor in the training of the youth of our land for the duties 
of life, it has no equal, and whatever may be its shortcom- 
ings, its future will be more and more important. 
2. Inirreracy. 
The real test of our educational system depends upon 
the percentage of illiterates among our native white popu- 
lation under twenty-five years of age. Our statistics show 
that among the native white male population of the United 
States from 21 ‘to 24 years of age, the amount of illiteracy 
is only 3.8 per cent. The principal European countries 
excelling us in respect to literacy are Germany, Sweden, 
Norway, Finland, Denmark, Switzerland, and Scotland. 
The first three have an almost negligible quantity of illit- 
eracy, while Netherlands, England, and France have only 
a slightly higher rate than ours. In Massachusetts, 
Connecticut, and nearly all of the Northern states west of 
the Mississippi River, the rate is less than one per cent, 
but none of these states can compare with Germany, which 
140
-P-A-G-E-147
ET ay ee en EN ee ee Rs ee Ce Fee te ee eT, ee pe ee 
THE NEW EDUCATION 141 
claims an illiteracy among its army recruits of only eleven 
hundredths of one per cent. Owing to the great illiteracy 
among our foreign born, the rate for our entire white male 
population 21 to 24 years of age is 5 per cent. Many of 
the immigrants have arrived here too late to receive the 
benefit of our public schools and have come from coun- 
tries in which education is but slightly appreciated. The 
illiteracy of the females of the same age is somewhat in 
excess of that of the males. This is especially true of the 
foreign born. Of our entire population 10 years of age 
and over, 10.7 per cent were illiterate in 1900 —a con 
siderable decrease, however, from the rates of the preceding 
decade. Although the negroes form but 11 per cent of the 
entire population, they furnish nearly 47 per cent of the 
illiteracy. In 1900, 44.5 per cent were classed as illiterate 
compared with 6.2 per cent for the white population. 
In 1890 more than half of the negroes were illiterate, there- 
fore some progress at least is indicated. 
The rates of illiteracy among native whites are only 
about one third of those of the foreign born, but native 
whites of native parentage have three times the illiteracy 
of native whites of foreign parentage. This latter fact is 
due not to any special desire on the part of foreign-born 
parents to educate their children, but to two other impor- 
tant considerations: first, the great majority of the chil- 
dren of immigrants live in the large cities where education 
is compulsory; second, absence of educational oppor- 
tunities and inferior economic conditions are responsible 
for a large illiteracy among the white children of the South, 
who are almost exclusively of native extraction. In the 
medium-sized cities, on the other hand, where laws are 
less stringent and where there are few foreign born, the 
native American children show less illiteracy than those 
of foreign parentage. Out of 160 cities having 25,000 
inhabitants or more, 99 have a greater proportion of illit-
-P-A-G-E-148
a eT Le ee ee Te ee ee RP TE ey Pe Nee) AEE 
142 CHILD PROBLEMS 
eracy among the children of foreign-born parents. In 53, 
the children of native parents have the larger proportion, 
and in 8 cities the rates are equal. 
The efficiency of our educational systems is largely in- 
dicated by the amount of illiteracy in the age group 10 to 
14 years. In 1900, this percentage for all races was 7.1 
per cent, but the aggregate number of white illiterates was 
less than that of the colored, in spite of the discrepancies 
in relative population. The lowest rates were found in 
Nebraska, Iowa, Oregon, the eastern North Central states, 
and in Connecticut, Utah, and Massachusetts. Child 
illiteracy is very high in the Southern states. This is due 
to high rates among both negroes and whites.!_ The cities 
enjoy an advantage over the country districts. A better 
educational system, better teachers, and compulsory school 
attendance — all tend to reduce the proportion of illiteracy 
in the cities to a lower level than that attained in rural 
sections. The aggregate number of illiterate children 
in 1900 was 577,649. Including adults, the total number 
of illiterates in the United States is more than six million 
persons. 
3. THE-ADAPTATION OF EpuUCcATION. 
The purpose of education should be to fit the child for 
life. } To accomplish this purpose the child must become 
endble of adapting himself to the conditions of his environ- 
ment, of enjoying the higher pleasures, and of taking his 
rightful place in society. It is obvious at once that no 
school can give the child a complete education, and that 
this is obtained slowly, if at all, through the lessons learned 
from activity in the world as well as through those taught 
1In the South Atlantic states in 1900 the illiteracy of colored children 
from 10 to 14 years of age was computed at 31.3 per cent, in the South 
Central states at 32.9 per cent. The illiteracy of white children for the 
corresponding sections was 9.4 and 9.8 per cent respectively. 
 
-P-A-G-E-149
  THE NEW EDUCATION 143 
in the classroom. The predominant interests of society 
vary from time to time, therefore the most important ele- 
ments in education will also vary. Literary education 
formerly received a very proper emphasis, and met popular 
needs quite effectually. It no longer does so, and industrial 
education must be added in order to adapt the child more 
fully to the requirements of modern industry. It is now 
generally admitted that the present literary education 
is inadequate, since it does not train the hand, although 
the vast majority of all persons become manual laborers. 
Both brain and hand should be educated, and each in pro- 
portion to the use which will be made of it in later life. 
4. Present Lrurtations or Epucation. 
The most successful education accomplishes two im- 
portant results : G prepares the child for life, and it sustains 
his interest until the essentials have been gainéd. In an 
industrial era book learning is plainly inadequate. Many 
practical-minded children lose interest in their work and 
drop out of school. One of two possible consequences 
may then occur: the child may become a truant and even- 
tually a delinquent, or he may enter some gainful occu- 
pation and swell the ranks of child laborers. In actual 
practice a tremendous decline in school attendance occurs 
after children leave the fifth grade. This is true not only 
where no compulsory education laws exist, but also in the 
large cities with their exceptional laws and advanced 
curricula. In New York City, for example, the sixth- 
grade classes show a decline of nearly 15 per cent in number 
from the preceding year. Eighth-grade students are less 
than one half as numerous as are those of the fifth year. 
Forty per cent of the children in the fifth year are above 
the normal age. Owing to the large number who drop out 
of school from this grade, the percentage of over-aged chil- 
dren in the higher grades decreases with each successive
-P-A-G-E-150
  144 CHILD PROBLEMS 
year. Other cities suffer a similar experience in regard to 
the disappearance of their school population. It is there- 
fore apparent that a large group of children leave the pub- 
lic school with a-very meager and inefficient educational 
equipment. This applies with equal force to the parochial 
schools, which are conducted in large numbers by the Cath- 
olic and Lutheran churches. 
5. Computsory Epucation. 
The movement in favor of compulsory education laws has 
made rapid strides within the last two decades. Twenty- . 
six states have such laws applying to children under 14 
years of age, but in many cases the necessary annual atten- 
dance is limited to 12 weeks. If children over 14 remain 
unemployed, many states require their school attendande 
until the age of 16. The New York law, for exampley—~ 
requires attendance for the entire school year of all children 
under the age of 14, and for the entire school year of un- 
employed children between 14 and 16. New Jersey re- 
cently passed a law requiring all children to remain in school 
until they finish the elementary grades or reach the fifteenth 
year of age. Under certain conditions, children not fin- 
ishing then are required to attend a day school until they 
become 17. The South has been tardy in the enactment 
of compulsory education laws, but in several Southern 
states such laws apply to particular cities or counties. 
Kentucky and Oklahoma have enacted state-wide laws, 
and in South Carolina, Texas, and Arkansas some restric- 
tions have been placed upon the employment of illiterate 
children. Such restrictions tend to keep children in school. 
Compulsory education is the proper complement of child 
labor laws, and should be required for the entire school 
year of all children who have not reached the working 
age specified in the laws. Twenty-three states now have 
provisions of this sort. The remainder of the states, by
-P-A-G-E-151
PL Noe he Te ES! eg RE MET Re te ee TS Ly ae ee ee ee 
THE NEW EDUCATION 145 
requiring a short attendance only or by allowing specific 
exemptions from the operation of the laws, fail to protect 
fully the educational interests of the children. Unless 
pupils attend regularly throughout the year, they will not 
obtain sufficient advantages from their education. Pov- 
erty exemptions for children under 14 can have no justi- 
fication. Philanthropy should intervene to provide the 
child with such aid as will make possible his continuation 
in school. 
The non-enforcement of compulsory education laws 
renders the advancement which has been made less than 
it appears. Attendance and truant officers, unless pro- 
vided in sufficient numbers, can not cope adequately with 
the problem. Efficiency of service is also needed. The 
poor change residence so frequently that children often 
can not be traced. In New York the migrating children 
who work in canning factories during the summer months 
receive but little education. In many country districts 
throughout the United States compulsory education laws 
do not actually increase school attendance. Irregularity, 
exemptions, and non-enforcement of law, therefore, ac- 
count partly for over-aged children and for the small num- 
ber who actually graduate from the grammar schools. 
Many children also leave school at the first opportunity 
and enter some gainful occupation, because restless and 
anxious for a chance to earn money, however little that 
may be. 
6. UNTRAINED CHILDREN IN INDUSTRY. 
Thousands of children enter industry without having 
finished their primary education or having obtained any 
industrial training. No children who drop out of school 
at the end of the fifth or sixth grade can hope to have 
acquired direct training for any occupation which they 
may enter, but the seventh and eighth-grade children do 
i 
 
-P-A-G-E-152
146 CHILD PROBLEMS 
acquire a little manual dexterity. The consequence of this 
exodus from the schools is an army of untrained workers. 
Cie child who drops out of school enters the first avail- 
able occupation.) This is almost uniformly some undesir- 
able trade which affords but little compensation. Boys 
enter the messenger service, run errands, become delivery 
boys for the large stores or the small groceries, or enter 
factories and become general utility boys with little pros- 
pect of training for permanent occupation. Some, it is 
true, are more fortunate and are able at once to begin the 
work of preparation for a coveted trade. When a boy is 
made an apprentice, it too frequently happens that instead 
of being taught a trade he is merely utilized as a handy 
boy, and learns his trade, if at all, by absorption. No 
special effort is made to instruct him, and unless he is 
ambitious and aggressive he will be retarded in his efforts 
to acquire definite trade knowledge. 
The great majority of children who inopportunely leave 
the public school for the gainful occupations necessarily 
lack in stability of mind and persistence in work. They, 
therefore, have no definite aims, have no particular trade 
in view, are willing to experiment with many forms of 
occupation, and bei without proper guidance are not 
taught the need of, c .t concentration of energy; as a 
result they quickly rift, om one occupation to another, 
d in many different employments     
    
    
    
       
   
      
    within a single year. Such a Bohemian industrial career 
prevents the a i in any trade and a desirable 
degree of spe the occupations entered 
are usually very rent ( erience of the child has 
no cumulative value. At the e1 1 of several years he is 
but little better pre ife t the beginning of 
his industrial career. ease in wages de- 
pends on the develop finite directions. 
This skill is not acquired es occupations,

THE NEW EDUCATION 147 
but remains at a comparatively stationary wage. After 
spending several years in almost useless and wasted labor 
at a very low wage, he joins the permanent ranks of un- 
skilled workers, and his wages soon reach a rigid limit at a 
point below the level of present standards of living. 
Our éducational system, which allows children who are 
almost illiterate to leave the schools and to enter industry 
is sadly at fault. A compulsory education law which ap- 
plies only to children below a certain age establishes arti- 
ficial and illogical boundary lines. If at 14 the boy happens 
to be behind his proper grade in school, the state is not 
justified in allowing him to begin wasting several years of 
time in unskilled occupations. If at 14 he is not pre- 
pared for life, but is mentally and physically capable of 
adequate preparation, he should be required to continue 
his school training. The fixing of arbitrary ages for com- 
pulsory attendance overlooks the entire problem of indus- 
trial efficiency, and emphasizes time instead of accom- 
plishment. Child labor laws should so supplement our 
educational requirements as to prevent the employment of 
all children not properly trained in the schools. Com- 
plete codperation between the two interests is necessary 
for the adequate equipment of our youth. 
7. INDUSTRIAL TRAINING. 
The industrial training of all prospective workers is de- 
sirable for two reasons : first, and most important, because 
it will enhance the skill of the worker, increase his wages, 
raise his standard of life, give him greater economic inde- 
pendence, and add to his general resourcefulness in in- 
dustry; second, because it will increase the productivity of 
society, stimulate inventions, and benefit consumers by 
fixing lower prices for goods. 
Two methods of training are possible:\ the apprentice- 
ship system, and trade instruction in thé schoeye The

former is rapidly declining, and will shortly be unavailable. 
The following reasons for its decline are given by the United 
States Bureau of Labor.t 
1. The decline of personal relations between master and 
apprentice. 
2. The extensive use of machinery and the subdivision 
of labor. 
3. The disinclination of employers to use apprentices. 
4. The unwillingness of journeymen to instruct appren- 
tices. 
5. The unwillingness of boys to become apprentices. 
Manufacturers are somewhat loath to grant apprentices 
the broad training necessary for their permanent welfare. 
The speed required in modern industry, and the extreme 
subdivision of labor, often induce the employer to attempt 
to limit the work of apprentices to some particular occu- 
pation in order that they may speedily acquire skill therein. 
This unsocial attitude is opposed by both the apprentice 
and the labor unions. The latter demand an extensive 
training of apprentices, and also frequently insist upon 
a limitation of their numbers. Another objection to the 
present method of employing apprentices is based on the 
practice of using them in the more unskilled forms of labor 
at lower rates of compensation than those paid to journey- 
men. They can be supervised by a competent journey- 
man, will do fairly satisfactory work, and will lessen the 
cost of production for the employer. The restrictions by 
trade unions, however, hardly affect the problem, and the 
larger industrial developments furnish the chief reasons 
for the decline of the apprenticeship system. 
The problem of industrial training must be solved by 
our educational system. Methods of instruction must be

Ralph Albertson. 
 
-P-A-G-E-155
THE NEW EDUCATION 149 
so revised as to meet the new needs of our industrial classes. 
The purpose of such training is not to satisfy narrow- 
minded manufacturers who are seeking for skilled labor . 
and who in some instances have advocated trade instruc- 
tion at an incredibly early age, but to equip individuals 
for their life work and make them capable and useful mem- 
bers of society. Not the advantage of some class interest, 
but the good of the social whole, is the goal of the movement. 
Industrial training in order to become an efficient service 
must touch the great bulk of workers. This can be ac- 
' complished in one of two ways, or by a combination of the 
two. All children must be compelled to remain in school 
until they have passed through the grades in which trade 
instrdction is now being taught, or such instruction must 
descend into the grades until it affects the great mass of 
children. Perhaps a compromise will yield the best results. 
a. Public Instruction. 
Our schools have begun to grapple with the question of 
trade training, and are now beginning with a plan of in- 
struction for the older and better trained children. Ac- 
cordingly in some cities trade schools which rank with 
high schools have been established. In these schools trade 
instruction may occupy only part of the time of the pupil, 
or the curriculum may be limited to practical training and 
such studies as bear directly on the trades taught. The 
former plan enjoys popular favor. Employers of labor 
have, however, availed themselves but little of the skilled 
workers trained in these schools. Pupils also have fre- 
quently elected these courses because of their desire for 
manual dexterity, although they have no intention of enter- 
ing the trades. The class of students in the trade school 
of high school grade does not largely supply the ranks of 
labor in the common acceptation of the term, and, there- 
fore, these schools fail to meet the immediate needs of the 
majority of prospective workers. The proportion of chil-
-P-A-G-E-156
ee ee OE ee eee TSE a See ee ee ON tg 
150 CHILD PROBLEMS 
dren graduating from the grammar school and entering 
upon a secondary education is so small that the limitation 
of trade instruction to this class prevents the achievement 
of considerable results. Although trade schools of high 
school rank have their place, the solution of the problem 
requires an extension of facilities for industrial training. 
The report of its special Committee on Trade Schools to 
the New York Board of Education illustrates the move- 
ment. Among the recommendations made were the fol- 
lowing : — 
1. ! That shop work be introduced into all schoolsin which 
there are boys in the seventh and eighth years. 
2. That as far as possible the practical use of tools em- 
ployed in the wood-working and metal-working trades be 
taught in those years. 
8. That the workshops be equipped, as far as possible, 
with the necessary tools. 
4, That shop work be required of boys who reach their 
twelfth year. 
5. That the additional time needed for the extension of 
work in the shop be fixed as between three and five in the 
afternoon, on Saturday morinngs, or, if necessary, in the 
evenings. 
6. That a separate vocational school for boys between 
fourteen and sixteen be established, and another for girls 
of the same ages. 
The two salient features of this program are the recom- 
mendations in favor of vocational schools for children be- 
tween the ages of fourteen and sixteen, and for more effec- 
tive manual training. Many children have not finished 
the grades, but would not therefore be barred from trade 
instruction, It is likewise considered important to “im- 
prove the efficiency of the present shop system in our ele-. 
1 Annual Report of Superintendent of Schools to Board of Educa- 
tion, 1908, p. 125.
-P-A-G-E-157
  THE NEW EDUCATION 151 
mentary schools by organizing the manual training from 
a vocational point of view so that it may bear direct and 
immediate relation to the industrial efficiency of the chil- 
dren when they leave school.” 
The vocational school which permits all graduates of 
the grammar schools to enter and all persons fourteen 
years of age who are sufficiently prepared for trade training, 
will reach a large group of children. The boy of fourteen 
who is still in the sixth grade probably needs precisely the 
character of work provided in a vocational school. Back- 
wardness is often the result of inadaptability to the lit- 
erary work of the elementary school. If the boy can be 
provided with purposeful manual training his real needs 
will have been more successfully met. Although manual 
training is gradually filtering down through the grades and 
reaching the younger children, it has not been sufficiently 
directed toward immediately useful ends. Shop work for 
all boys twelve years of age or over, and cooking, sewing, 
and household economy for all girls in the seventh and 
eighth grades are necessary to reach the great majority 
of children. So many leave school at the end of the fifth 
grade that a large number of girls would still escape the 
needed courses in domestic science. Literary instruction, 
however, can not be displaced, and the new adaptations 
must consider the entire gamut of individual interests, the 
social and cultural group as well as the industrial. The 
introduction of useful manual training in the seventh and 
eighth grades is proceeding rapidly among the schools in 
our larger cities, and the reorganization of the work will 
prove of immense value to our prospective working popu- 
lation. 
The original purpose of manual training is being diverted 
from that of making the hands skillful to that of training 
them for skill in the accomplishment of some useful purpose. 
The severe conditions of modern industry require men  
-P-A-G-E-158
152 CHILD PROBLEMS 
armed with manual skill and trade training, and the workers 
who are not properly equipped can not hope to maintain 
reasonable or progressive standards of life. The older 
methods of training provided a broad education, and the 
departure therefrom results in a loss in the sweep of knowl- 
edge, but a gain in specialization and equipment for a par- 
ticular service. The tendency is to narrow education, 
but the welfare of the masses requires this concession to 
utilitarianism. The movement must be regarded as a 
means to an end, and not as a desirable goal. Industrial 
education represents the immediate adaptation to the cur- 
rent needs of the present transition stage. In a future 
society education may be compelled to adapt itself to new 
needs, always with the distinct hope of bringing to all the 
greatest possible breadth and depth of education and 
culture. 
Evening trade schools have met with less resistance than 
day trade schools. Several of the large cities have estab- 
lished such schools for boys and girls who work during the 
day and who desire to increase their efficiency by enjoying 
the advantages of these schools. Unfortunately the tax 
on the workers is too great to justify such a combination 
of work and study, and means should be provided to make 
possible the use of part of the working day for school pur- 
poses, for children under a certain age. The system of 
compelling such young people who work throughout the 
day to attend night trade or immigrant schools:can only 
be justified as a temporary measure. For older persons 
the evening school is more appropriate, and rest from the 
work of the day less necessary for physical growth and 
development. 
Opinion is rapidly crystallizing in favor of public in- 
struction in industrial training. The subject is agitated 
by employers of labor, by philanthropic workers, and 
boards of education. The labor unions which had long 
 
-P-A-G-E-159
  THE NEW EDUCATION 153 
held a dubious attitude, at the Convention of the American 
Federation of Labor at Toronto, Canada, October, 1909, 
declared themselves in favor of trade schools for children 
between fourteen and sixteen years of age. They de- 
manded, however, that other subjects be taught in addition 
to industrial training. Such subjects were to include the 
sciences that are related to the trades chosen, mathematics, 
certain English courses, and special phases of economic 
theory. That the public school system should provide 
elementary industrial training is now generally admitted. 
Vocational schools should provide courses of at least two 
years’ duration. But how to reach the children who would 
commonly limit themselves to a grammar school is the 
greatest difficulty with which the advocates of industrial 
training have to contend. Abundant facilities are pro- 
vided for those who can afford a secondary or college 
education. Our state and private institutions, technical 
schools, and specialized institutions grant sufficient oppor- 
tunity for advanced training. 
b. Private Trade Training. 
Apart from technical schools for advanced students, 
several private schools adapted to the needs of persons 
sixteen years of age or over, have been established and are 
leading the way for our public school system. Among 
typical schools of this class are the New York Trade School, 
the Williamson Free Trade School in Pennsylvania, and 
the Ranken Trade School of St. Louis. The New York 
school provides a short-term training, the other two in- 
clude courses covering three and two years respectively. 
In the New York school are taught : plumbing, carpentry, 
electrical work, brick laying, sign painting, house and 
fresco painting, sheet-metal and cornice work, plastering, 
steam and hot water fitting, blacksmithing, printing, and 
drawing. The Williamson Free School, as an example 
of the type with a longer curriculum, covers such trades as :
-P-A-G-E-160
154 CHILD PROBLEMS 
carpentry, brick laying, — including range, furnace, and 
boiler setting, — pattern and cabinet making, machine 
trade with its many details, steam and electrical engineer- 
ing, steam fitting, etc. Each pupil is required to take a 
preliminary course in wood carving and mechanical draw- 
ing, and a well-developed academic department supple- 
ments the industrial training with courses in science and 
literature. 
Among the hundreds of private schools which equip 
boys and girls for some particular trade or occupation, 
such as stenography and typewriting, bookkeeping, sew- 
ing, millinery, plumbing, etc., are many which maintain 
such low standards that the graduate is ill equipped 
to perform his work efficiently. Literary requirements are 
often too low, and insufficient time is allowed for a proper 
completion of the course. Very incompetent individuals 
are thus frequently graduated and allowed to begin their 
industrial career. It behooves our educational system 
to organize its industrial and commercial instruction so 
effectively that our boys and girls can acquire the needed 
training in the public schools and be compelled to carry 
sufficient literary work to make them thoroughly com- 
petent to fill their position in industry. In this way the 
slipshod and inefficient methods of many private schools 
can be eliminated and real industrial efficiency be pro- 
cured. 
8. Instruction tn Sex PuysroLoey. 
Boys and girls need instruction in the fundamental 
facts of sex physiology. The fact that one fourth or more 
of all blind children become so because of the immorality 
of parents, that sterility is largely traceable to vice, that 
thousands of women are brought to the operating table 
because of the immorality of men — these and other as- 
tounding facts of present civilization indicate that in some 
 
-P-A-G-E-161
         THE NEW EDUCATION 155 
Te 
way society must pay attention to our youth so that the 
elimination of these demoralizing results can be effected. 
The girl suffers chiefly through ignorance. The boy, on 
the other hand, needs not only knowledge but a develop- 
ment of moral fiber, and both sexes need to view the subject 
in a more complacent and less sentimental manner. In- 
struction is certainly needed. Who shall provide it is a 
mooted question. Shall it be the parents or the teacher? 
The question must receive the most delicate treatment. 
Unless the present attitude of the child can be completely 
changed and a feeling of reverence substituted, instruction 
may become absolutely harmful. Parents find it difficult 
to discuss this subject with their children and to make 
them realize the noble plane on which reflections on these 
facts must rest. Children learn from evil sources, and are 
debased thereby. If the knowledge gained from parents 
or teachers does not dignify the subject, it only keeps 
alive evil thoughts and impulses. It would be hard, how- 
ever, to imagine a system of instruction that would be worse 
in its results than the present negligence. If the subject 
is to be handled by the teacher, it should not be delayed 
until the high school age, for few will reap the advantage. 
A number of classes in physiology have successfully in- 
cluded a discussion of the facts of sex, but this method 
will hardly be possible for young children. In Germany, 
especially, progress has been made by leading children 
through the natural steps of plant life to the animal and 
human facts of sex. American societies for the promotion 
of social hygiene are now devising methods of education.

CHAPTER I 
CAUSES OF CHILD LABOR 
Tue causes of child labor may be summarized under 
several heads, but the precise influence of each cause can not 
be weighed. The different contributing factors are so 
interdependent that if one of the causes should suddenly 
fail the others would become largely inactive; at least 
much of their coercive power would have disappeared. 
Nor do the factors work with equal force in different local- 
ities. In some regions a certain cause will be much more 
powerful than any other. In other localities the remaining 
causes will be by far the most potent forces responsible 
for the evil. 
1. Avarice or PaRENrTs. 
That the greed of parents is often the chief cause of 
the employment of children is an undeniable fact. Many 
parents, both those engaged in farming and those employed 
in other industry, regard their growing children as capital 
or economic assets on which they hope to realize as soon 
as dividends can be declared. Thousands of rural children 
are recorded as engaged in gainful occupations. Work- 
ing with their parents upon the home farm, they do not 
usually suffer from exploitation, and the profits gained 
will ultimately be shared by the children. Consequently 
such child labor has extenuating features. Too often, 
however, the farmer compels his small son who ought to be 
159 
 
-P-A-G-E-166
} 160 CHILD PROBLEMS 
in the village school to assist in the farm work, and inthis 
way the boy is deprived of a sufficient education to become 
efficient in any occupation other than that of farming. 
The small boy compelled to hire out to another farmer 
suffers more from the evils of child labor, and his lot is 
not enviable. 
Parental greed presents its darkest aspects in the attitude 
of the ignorant classes of native Americans and of a large 
proportion of the newly arrived immigrant population. 
In fact, the child labor question is in some sections closely 
allied to the problem of immigration. Children are ex- 
ploited for two principal reasons: first, in order to in- 
crease the family income; second, to enable parents to 
withdraw from work and live upon the earnings which 
the children provide. Fall River, Massachusetts, furnishes 
a good example of the tendency to use the entire family 
as an income-gaining agency. In addition to husband 
and wife, the children of the foreign born enter the mills 
as soon as the laws of the state permit. Investigation has 
amply shown that parents often send their children to 
work as soon as the fourteenth birthday has been reached, 
despite the deficiency in education which may exist. Hun- 
dreds of children drop out of school in the midst of their 
school year, and are expected to become wholly, or at 
least partly,- self-supporting. Factory inspectors fre- 
quently find that children do not give their age correctly 
and claim to be above the required working age, no matter 
how small or under-aged they may appear. Furthermore, 
parents are often guilty of perjury in regard to the ages 
of their children. In the anthracite regions of Pennsyl- 
vania the extensive violations of. the law are in part 
attributable to the dishonesty and false ideals of 
parents. 
The second cause of exploitation finds a less common 
expression, but is not absent. The child labor problem
-P-A-G-E-167
  CAUSES OF CHILD LABOR 161 
in New England before 1820 was somewhat intensified 
by the desire of parents to retire as soon as their children 
were able to obtain sufficient wages to maintain the entire 
family. In more recent years indolent and shiftless parents 
have allowed their children as soon as possible to bear the 
entire burden of family support. An extreme case of this 
kind has recently been noted. A young foreigner not many 
years in the United States, having married early, found that 
when he had reached the age of thirty-four his children 
were able to support him, and that the family could be 
maintained without his aid. He therefore retired, and 
began to spend his days in idleness and pleasure. Cases 
have been cited of fathers in the cotton mill district of 
the South whose chief occupation was that of car- 
rying lunches and dinners to their children in the fac- 
tories ! 
2. Dustre or THE CHILD To Work. 
The desire of the child to work is a more important fac- 
tor than public opinion has been accustomed to believe. 
The young child does not understand the full value of the 
education which he is receiving, and longs to leave the con- 
finement of the schoolroom and try his fortunes in gainful 
employment. This fecling is aggravated by the fact that 
education is not fully adapted to the child’s needs. { Re- 
cent investigations have shown that a considerable’ per- 
centage of working children deliberately leave school 
before their education in the grades is completed because 
they are anxious to avoid the burden and drudgery of the 
schoolroom. They observe that their friends and other 
children are earning some wages, even though the sums 
be small, and they are eager therefore to vie with them 
in the distinction of being in part self-supporting and of 
enjoying spending money of their own. In fact, the child, 
instead of being driven to work, often takes this step volun- 
M
-P-A-G-E-168
162 CHILD PROBLEMS 
tarily. Worse than that, parents are frequently unable 
to compel the child to remain at school. Such children, 
although eager to work, are totally unfitted to enter any 
occupation. 
3. GREED oF EMPLOYERS. 
The attitude of employers of labor is responsible for a 
large proportion of the child labor of the United States. 
The culpability of the employer in this respect is twofold : 
first, he makes the entrance of the child into industry 
possible by employing children who are pressed into ser- 
vice by their parents or who deliberately decide to enter 
on their own initiative. By accepting children he en- 
courages the tendency of parents and: child workers to 
continue the evil of child labor. In the second place, 
many employers directly encourage and demand child 
labor in order to enhance their profits. The pressure of 
parents would be of no avail if employers did not offer 
inducements to children. Wages indeed are poor, but 
other considerations play a part. When the child, dis- 
couraged on account of unsatisfactory school work, turns 
to the factory or mill, he often finds a cordial welcome in 
industry instead of finding the doors resolutely closed 
against him. An increasing number of employers, in- 
fluenced by both human kindness and longsighted busi- 
ness considerations, have reduced the quantity of child 
labor in their employ, but a large contingent still favor 
the employment of children and do not consider the in- 
fluence of such employment upon the future prospects 
of the child. Progressive employers have sometimes 
voluntarily refused to encourage child labor. In the South 
this attitude has taken the form of temporary agreements 
not to employ children below a certain age. Competitive 
conditions, however, usually prevent such agreements from 
becoming permanent. 
 
-P-A-G-E-169
  CAUSES OF CHILD LABOR 163 
The attitude of the dominating faction in industry is 
indicated by the character of the laws in those states in 
which certain industries are largely localized. In’ spite 
of protestations to the contrary, the canning and preserv- 
ing industry has endeavored to prevent wholesome child 
labor legislation. In nearly every state in which this in- 
dustry is economically important it is wholly or partially 
exempt from the operation of child labor laws. The ex- 
emption is based on the supposed necessity of working 
long and irregular hours in order to save perishable prod- 
ucts. Long hours, however, are not limited to the period 
when additional work is necessary to save the product, but 
occur at other intervals, and thus represent a real abuse. 
Among many instances personally known to the writer 
is that of a cannery which operated at night, presumably 
. to save the unusually large crop, although at that time 
receipts were actually below the normal expectation for 
the year. The crops were suffering from a drought, the 
output was necessarily small, yet the night work continued. 
It thus appeared that the capacity of the plant was hardly 
sufficient for normal years, and that systematic overtime 
was practiced. Another illustration of the power as well 
as the attitude of some employers is found in the state of 
Delaware, which exempts the manufacture of fruit and 
berry baskets from the operation of the child labor law, 
although there is no question concerning the perishability 
of the product. The employers who did not want the law 
to apply to their industry were sufficiently powerful to 
prevent its extension. 
The failure of Pennsylvania to prohibit the night work 
of boys in the glasshouses of that state illustrates the power 
of the glass manufacturers. At present boys of fourteen 
and over may work in the glass mills on all-night shifts. 
In no other state in which the glass industry is important 
is night work of children allowed, but in New Jersey it has
-P-A-G-E-170
  164 CHILD PROBLEMS 
only recently been abandoned. The argument that the 
products manufactured are perishable goods can hardly be 
made to apply to glass, although the exemption has been 
made on this theory. A conspicuous illustration of oppo- 
sition by many manufacturers to child labor reform is 
furnished by the cotton mill industry of the South. Out- 
side of agriculture this is the most important child-employ- 
ing industry of this section. The South is rapidly sur- 
passing the New England states in the cotton industry, 
and will soon manufacture the major portion of the cotton 
goods made in the United States, although at present it 
excels only in making the cheaper products. The most 
determined efforts of reformers in North and South Caro- 
lina, Georgia, and Alabama — the principal cotton manu- 
facturing states of the South — have so far failed to secure 
the enactment of adequate child labor laws. In each of 
these states the laws fall far short of the standards estab- 
lished by social reformers. Failure to restrict night work, 
the low minimum age limit, and the absence of efficient 
systems of inspection and enforcement — all indicate that 
economic conditions and the influence of mill owners are 
too powerful to permit reasonable child labor legislation. 
It must not be forgotten that many Southern mill owners 
are strong supporters of moderate child labor laws, and that 
manufacturers frequently maintain schools for the mill 
children who in their old homes received no education 
whatsoever. Quite singularly also some of the strongest 
opponents of progressive legislation are Northern men who 
have invested in Southern cotton mills and who are credited 
with willing conformity to the more advanced laws of New 
England. 
The newsboy has enjoyed greater immunity from the law 
than any other class of working children. Many news- 
papers, although they advocate suitable child labor laws 
for other industries, are opposed to legislation which will
-P-A-G-E-171
  CAUSES OF CHILD LABOR 165 
curtail the operations of the vendor of their own wares. 
This opposition arises from two causes: the belief that 
the newsboy conduces to a larger circulation of the paper, 
and sympathy for the boy in his present desires rather 
than in his future needs. Attachment to the boy, com- 
mendable at the right time but not appropriate in this 
connection, aids him in the continuation of his own un- 
doing. Other industries which use their influence to 
weaken or prevent child labor legislation could be men- 
tioned, but those discussed illustrate an important cause 
of child labor. 
4. Moprern InpustriAL ConpITIons. 
Modern industrial conditions have made room for both 
woman and child labor in two ways: first, by the use of 
improved machinery, and second, by such a minute sub- 
division of labor as to separate lighter forms of work from 
the more difficult occupations. Children are in many 
cases able to operate a machine because modern improve- 
ments have made it so nearly automatic. The machinist 
must be continued, but the adult operators can be dismissed 
in favor of the young boy or girl. When the work does 
not require special skill or strength, the tendency to use 
the child is especially marked. The chief advantage which 
accrues to the employer from this substitution is the use of 
poorly paid child labor instead of adult labor. Nor is out- 
put decreased by this change, as the worn-out boy can soon 
be displaced by another eager to obtain his paltry earnings. 
In certain factories young girls from fourteen to sixteen 
years of age are taking the place of men in-the operation 
of machines, but are receiving wages no higher than those 
usually paid to girls of that age. The writer recently 
saw a machine operated by a girl of this description. The 
machine was comparatively new, and had displaced one 
which had always been controlled by men. The new 
&
-P-A-G-E-172
166 CHILD PROBLEMS 
machine, owing to the simplifications which had been made, 
was not only operated by the girl, but was capable of a 
much larger output than was its predecessor. The girl, 
however, received the regular wages paid to children. 
Modern machinery is able to utilize the child as a helper. 
Much work which requires time and running to and fro 
is apportioned to the little boy or girl. In the cotton mills 
the children are very largely used for this kind of work ; 
for example, the doffers, bobbin boys, and spool boys. In 
fact, a large proportion of the older boys drop out of the 
cotton mills because they have outgrown their work. The 
glasshouses use boys in similar ways; and elsewhere in 
industry niches for the employment of the child have been 
made by the convenience afforded by the helper and the 
apprentice. The extreme subdivision of modern labor 
accentuates the problem of child labor. A particular 
occupation may thus be isolated from the series of processes 
necessary to complete an article; and if only a single act 
of skill is required, a child can become proficient in a short 
time. In the clothing trade such minor occupations 
become a department in which children are frequently 
employed. The tasks allotted to small girls in the manu- 
facture of artificial flowers require little skill ; all processes 
requiring much care and attention are performed by skilled 
hands, but much can be left to the work of the untried 
employee. The comparative facility with which a large 
proportion of the occupations in many mills can be per- 
formed tends directly toward the use of the child wherever 
he can be secured for the carrying on of these occupations. 
Modern competition is an additional factor which often 
paralyzes the efforts of progressive manufacturers. The 
margin of profit is frequently so narrow that legislation 
may become a menace. Natural advantages and child 
labor in some states also operate to encourage the use of 
child labor in other states. The competitive conditions 
 
-P-A-G-E-173
  CAUSES OF CHILD LABOR 167 
over which employers have no immediate control are often 
responsible for the antagonistic attitude of employers 
toward the abolition of child labor. 
5. INDIFFERENCE OF THE PUBLIC. 
The public can eliminate much child labor by seriously 
opposing the practice. The culpability of the public takes 
several forms: direct preference for the goods or wares made 
or peddled by the child ; a willingness to allow child labor 
for'purposes of self-support or support of dependent par- 
ents; inability to recognize the ultimate results of prema- 
ture child labor ; the desire to purchase goods at the lowest 
possible cost regardless of the child labor which may be 
involved; and finally, utter indifference to the social 
problem itself. The public encourages child labor by its 
willful patronage of the small boy. The tiny newsboy 
seated.on the doorstep of a public building gets the major 
portion of the business without exertion on his part, while 
the larger boy strives in vain to secure his share of the sales. 
The same principle obtains with the child selling wares 
on the streets. Sympathy for the child blinds reason and 
foresight, and thus the child is allowed to continue his 
work. The public must learn that it is not efficient kind- 
ness to buy from the small boy, but that such a policy is 
demoralizing to the child. 
In some of our states children are exempt from the 
application of the laws if their work is necessary to main- 
tain dependent members of the family. A social attitude 
which allows a child under fourteen to bear the economic 
burdens of a family is responsible for much of this evil. 
In some states the laws contain a poverty exemption clause. 
Children of tender years can thus be exploited and com- 
pelled to labor for hire. Even our relief societies, which 
supposedly are actuated by the most prudential and far- 
sighted motives, will, on occasion, endanger the prospects
-P-A-G-E-174
  168 CHILD PROBLEMS 
of the child by insisting that upon his arriving at the age 
when he may legally be employed he shall immediately 
enter some gainful occupation in order to relieve the public 
of the support of dependent parents. This has been done 
in spite of the child’s immaturity and lack of preparation 
for industry. Such societies are grossly neglectful of their 
duty and short-sighted in their methods when they force 
the child prematurely into industry to relieve themselves 
of a burden. 
Many men of prominence fail to realize that the new 
industrial conditions require special preparation on the 
child’s part. Because many men began work as mere boys 
and succeeded, is no argument against wholesome legis- 
lation at the present time. Yet recently United States 
senators in opposing appropriate legislation pointed to 
their own cases as sufficient proof of the harmlessness of 
child labor. Successful men frequently oppose good laws 
because they themselves have not failed and have withstood 
the disadvantages of premature toil. They have thus 
become blinded to the evil effects of child labor, and are 
often bitter enemies of the real interests of the child of 
to-day. The farming class likewise fails to understand 
the dangers of child labor in the cities and in industrial 
centers, because farmers are prone to judge the results of 
all forms of labor by the effects of labor on the farm. In our 
legislatures such men are easily influenced to oppose needed 
legislation. 
It thus appears that while the specific causes of child 
labor are numerous, the chief factors are reducible to five 
heads: the attitude of the parents, the ambition of the 
child, the greed of employers, modern industrial conditions, 
and the indifference of the public. The relative importance 
of each of these factors can not even be approximated, and 
in most instances they codperate closely to produce the 
evil in question, but the absence of any one of these causes
-P-A-G-E-175
I _  OOm— 
CAUSES OF CHILD LABOR 169 
materially diminishes the amount of child labor. As a 
preventive of progressive legislation the opposition of the 
employer undoubtedly stands foremost, but the non- 
enforcement of law depends upon every one of the above 
causes. 
 
-P-A-G-E-176
CHAPTER II 
CONDITIONS OF CHILD LABOR 
1. OccupationaL DistTRIBUTION. 
The menace of child labor lies to a large extent in the 
character of work demanded of the growing child. Health 
depends partly upon the opportunity for outdoor work 
or the necessity of indoor work. Industrial opportunity 
may be enhanced or retarded by the specific employment in 
which the child engages. Morals likewise are contingent 
upon the nature of the employment. Therefore the occu- 
pational distribution of child labor throws light upon the 
gravity of our problem, as does also the aggregate number 
of children engaged in industry. Thesocial attitude toward 
the child labor problem should be that of exclusion of all 
children from all occupations unless it is clear that the 
employment of the child would not retard his development 
but would increase his opportunities and capacity for 
usefulness. 
According to the Census of 1900 the amount and dis- 
tribution of child labor in the United States in that year is 
represented in the statistical table on page 171. 
These statistics illustrate the distribution of child labor 
among the five large occupational groups, as well as among 
certain subsidiary occupations. It will be noticed that 
more than one million of the workers are engaged in agri- 
culture, which is less objectionable as a field of employ- 
ment than any other occupation. Fifty-three per cent of 
this group are native whites of native parents, and 38 per

cent are negro children. It is significant that only a small 
percentage — about 8 per cent — are foreign born or the 
children of foreign parents. More than 800,000 of these 
children were members of the farmers’ families, and were 
simply assisting their parents. The chief danger for a 
majority of these children is the probability of their receiv- 
ing an insufficient education to meet the strenuous de- 
mands of modern business, both in the country and in the 
city. 
For obvious reasons professional service is not an im- 
portant occupation of the child, and therefore needs no 
further discussion. Domestic and personal service, how- 
ever, claims the employment of a large group of children, 
and with these begins a more serious aspect of child labor. 
Children of native parentage form only 38 per cent of the 
total, negroes constitute one third, and the children of
-P-A-G-E-178
Re Re ry ae ee eer MM eR TS ee rime 
| 172 CHILD PROBLEMS 
foreign parents the remainder, or 28 per cent. The nature 
of the problem differs from that of agriculture, in that 
purely business, and not blood, ties obtain in the relation- 
ship of employer and employee. The character of the 
occupations falling within this group is such that it fails 
to give the independence. and opportunities needed by the 
children. About one half of the entire number are em- 
ployed as servants and waiters, and thus begin at an early 
age in an occupation for which they are not fitted and which 
promises much menial work as well as moral temptation. 
Owing to the number of young girls in this group of occu- 
pations, the moral effects are especially serious. 
Trade and transportation, and manufacturing and me- 
chanical pursuits, together, employ more than 400,000 
boys and girls, and the problem of child labor applies with 
special force to the great majority of children in these 
groups. The more noteworthy occupations are those 
connected with the cotton and the textile mills, the mes- 
senger service, mines, and mercantile establishments. In 
trade and transportation, 52 per cent of the children 
employed are of foreign parentage, nearly all of the re- 
mainder being native born of native parents; the number 
of negroes in this group is comparatively small. In manu- 
facturing, children of foreign parents form a still larger 
proportion and constitute 56 per cent, and children of 
( native white parentage form 40.5 per cent. In the cotton 
mills, however, the native element predominates; this 
fact is due to the prevalence of child labor in the Southern 
cotton mills, in which, owing to the absence of an immi- 
grant population, the children employed are almost ex- 
clusively of native parentage. In the North, where a fair 
comparison of the relative tendencies of the native and the 
foreign-born child to engage prematurely in the gainful 
occupations can be made, the children of native parents 
form only about one eighth of the total number of children
-P-A-G-E-179
  ee ee ee ee 
CONDITIONS OF CHILD LABOR 173 
employed in the cotton mills. The foreign born consti- 
tute one half, and the remaining three eighths consist of 
the children of foreigners, thus indicating thatin the North- 
ern states the problem is closely allied to that of the immi- 
grant. 
The textile workers furnish another interesting illus- 
tration of the predominance of the foreign element in child 
labor. Among the girls who comprise the great propor- 
tion of the children in this group of occupations only 26 
per cent are of native parentage, 46 per cent are natives 
of foreign parentage, and more than one fourth are them- 
selves foreign born. In the messenger service more than 
55 per cent of the boys are of foreign parentage, but, since 
this occupation is largely limited to the large cities where 
persons of foreign parentage form a majority, this propor- 
tion is not excessive. A considerable number of children 
are found in our coal mines and in quarries. Of,the total 
number so employed about 60 per cent are the children 
of foreign-born parents. In the silk mills in the United 
States in 1900 only 57 per cent of the white children em- 
ployed were of foreign parentage, although in New York 
and New Jersey the percentage rose to 75. In Penn- 
sylvania, on the other hand, children of native parentage 
actually formed a majority. In thetobacco and cigar mak- 
ing trades the native element is in the minority, but in the 
glasshouses they constitute a majority, one reason for this 
fact being the establishment of the glassworks in the 
smaller towns, where the children of foreign parents are 
less numerous. 
Omitting the children engaged in agriculture and those 
engaged in several minor and perhaps harmless occupa- 
tions, it appears that in 1900 about 600,000 children were 
employed in industries and trades in which their employ- 
ment constitutes a serious problem. Tendencies are, how- 
ever, as important as aggregate numbers, and the serious- 
 
-P-A-G-E-180
a 
174 CHILD PROBLEMS 
ness of the question depends largely upon the changing pro- 
portions of children at work. In 1880, of all children from 
ten to fifteen years of age, 16.8 per cent were engaged in 
gainful occupations, but by 1900 the percentage had risen 
to 18.2. Boys and girls alike shared in this increase. The 
groups of occupations which were particularly affected indi- 
cate more clearly the nature of the change. A small in- 
crease occurred in agriculture, but this will occasion but 
little harm. The percentage engaged in domestic service 
has declined, but in trade’ and transportation a heavy 
increase has taken place. The most serious change has 
been the tremendous addition to the number of children 
engaged in manufacturing—the group of occupations 
which furnish the greatest problem of child labor. Chil- 
dren have likewise encroached upon the adult working popu- 
lation, and in 1900 were forming a larger percentage of the 
entire labor force, thus indicating that they have in part 
been substituted for adults. It is evident that women 
are frequently displaced by girls and that to some extent 
boys take the place of men. New industries have grown 
up, and children are peed in large numbers to do the lighter 
forms of work. 
The enactment of drastic child labor laws in a number of 
states has materially decreased the number of small chil- 
dren at work and made it more difficult for the larger ones 
to enter industry. The changing attitude in many locali- 
ties of employers of labor toward the child has also as- 
sisted in lessening the number of opportunities for child 
labor. On the other hand, in some states the number 
of children at work is perceptibly increasing. While the 
number of children in the cotton mills of the North has 
decreased since 1900, the opposite is true for the mills of 
the South. The amount of such labor in the Southern mills 
is unknown, but probably the estimate of 60,000 made by 
a representative of the National Child Labor Committee 
     
-P-A-G-E-181
  CONDITIONS OF CHILD LABOR 175 
is not too large, although this number is more than twice 
the total number of children employed in these mills in 
1900. A large percentage of these children are under 
fifteen years of age. In the Pennsylvania mine regions 
the number of boys at work has also increased very rapidly, 
owing to lax enforcement of law and the incursion of for- 
eigners who look with disfavor on the attempts to prevent 
their children from working. The recent exodus of silk 
mills from New Jersey to the anthracite regions of Penn- 
sylvania is partly due to the readiness of foreign girls to 
enter the mills. The fathers and sons are in the mines or 
breakers, and in order to give work to the daughters appro- 
priate mills must be built! This achievement is accom- 
plished by bringing the mills from another state where child 
labor is less popular. 
2. Turriror1aL DISTRIBUTION. 
The percentage of negro children at work is much larger 
than that of the whites, and since they live largely in the 
South the proportion of child labor in that locality is con- 
siderably augmented. Negroes, old and young, however, 
are found chiefly in the rural districts, and of the negro 
working children, 80 per cent are engaged in agriculture. 
Including all children in agricultural. occupations, the 
South furnishes 60 per cent of the total child labor of this 
country. If agriculture is excluded, the chief incidence 
of child labor falls upon the North Atlantic states and the 
principal manufacturing states of the Middle West. Al- 
though Alabama has the largest number of children at 
work, the’ great majority of these are engaged in agricul- 
ture. Qn the other hand, Pennsylvania has considerably 
more than 100,000 children engaged in other than agricul- 
tural pursuits, and is followed by New York, Illinois, and 
Ohio, in the order given. In the North Atlantic states 
68 per cent of the total child labor is in manufacturing,
-P-A-G-E-182
  176 CHILD PROBLEMS 
and trade and transportation, and 70 per cent of the female 
child labor is engaged in these occupations. In the South- 
ern states more than 80 per cent of the male, and nearly 
70 per cent of the female child labor is in agriculture, but 
the amount of labor in manufacturing has rapidly increased 
since 1900. 
As certain child-employing industries are partly localized, 
the states in which these industries are located gain an 
unenviable reputation. Pennsylvania and New Jersey 
lead in the manufacture of silk, and the former state em- 
ploys more than one half of the children working in the silk 
mills of the United States. The coal industry of Penn- 
sylvania also employs about 60 per cent of the entire force 
of boys working in the coal mines of the country, and 
nearly one third of the child glassworkers belong to the 
same state. Many children are employed in the canning 
and preserving industry. Maryland and New York lead 
in this industry and employ large groups of children in the 
work of preparing the material for canning and preserving. 
3. AcE anp Lirmracy. 
The one and three quarter millions of child laborers 
include all the workers between the ages of ten and sixteen 
years. Naturally the greatest concentration would be in 
the fourteenth and fifteenth years. 62 per cent of the 
entire number fall within these years ; thus leaving nearly 
800,000 who are from ten to thirteen years of age. More 
than one half of the child workers on the farm are less 
than fourteen years of age, but the majority are merely 
assisting their parents. Negro children begin to work at 
an earlier age than do white children, nearly 60 per cent 
of them being less than fourteen. The great majority of all 
foreign-born children fifteen years of age are engaged in 
some gainful occupation. Of the children at work during 
the early years of life, native whites of native parents have
-P-A-G-E-183
  DE, a ee ee ee ee eee eS eS ee Ss ee ee 
CONDITIONS OF CHILD LABOR 177 
a larger proportion than have other whites. On the other 
hand, they have a smaller proportion of child workers in 
the fourteenth and fifteenth years. These facts indicate 
that the (children of American parentage have a greater 
desire for training than do the foreign born or their chil- 
dren.) The age distribution of child workers in the various 
industries, excluding agriculture, is, according to the census 
of 1900, represented by the following table : —

More than 300,000 of the entire group of children are fif- 
teen years of age, and only 27 per cent are less than four- 
teen years old. If the fifteenth birthday, however, is 
made the dividing line, it will be seen that 52 per cent of 
the total number are below this age. As many reformers 
advocate the establishment of fifteen as the minimum 
age limit, the importance of these numbers becomes 
apparent. 
In the industries other than agriculture we find several 
occupations in which a large percentage of children are 
employed who are only ten or eleven years of age. Among 
these, servants and waiters head the list, and workers in 
the cotton mills follow. Local investigations recently 
made into the ages of boys in the coal districts of Penn- 
sylvania have revealed the fact that a considerable num- 
ber of boys nine years of age and over were employed in 
and about the mines. In the South likewise many children 
under ten years of age have until recently been allowed to 
work in factories, and, owing to inadequate enforcement 
N
-P-A-G-E-184
a ey Te ee pe ee eT eee ee ee ee eS ee 
178 CHILD PROBLEMS 
of the law, the percentage of children under twelve years 
is very large, but no accurate estimates of the total num- 
ber can be made. Investigations in the mill districts of 
the South show that many children now ten or twelve 
years of age began to work at seven. Small children not 
over six or seven years of age stay at the mills during the 
day and perhaps “help” a little, but are not regular workers. 
Exemptions for orphans and children of dependent parents 
allow such children to work regardless of age, and many 
begin work in the factories while very young. In some 
states during the summer vacation the laws do not apply 
to all industries, and small children therefore engage in 
the exempted occupations. 
Little is known of the educational qualifications of the 
child who is at work, as no general investigation of this 
subject has as yet been made. About 30 per cent of all 
negro children from ten to fourteen years of age, however, 
are illiterate, and no doubt the ratio for those engaged in 
gainful occupations is still higher. In the Northern states 
the amount of illiteracy is small, but in the South nearly 
10 per cent of all white children of the above ages are illit- 
erate. The proportion of illiteracy among the children 
in the cotton mills is undoubtedly much larger, since the 
major portion of the workers are secured from that class 
of the population which has not yet learned the value of 
education. A census of one mill showed that twenty- 
eight out of forty-one children were illiterate. The eager- 
ness of the foreign-born children throughout the entire 
United States to enter industry results in a low level of 
learning for this class, although the absolute illiteracy is 
small. 
4. Nigar Work oF CHILDREN. 
One of the greatest abuses of child labor is night work. 
This, however, is rapidly diminishing. Overtime, which
-P-A-G-E-185
  CONDITIONS OF CHILD LABOR 179 
is often required of employees in factories and mercantile 
establishments, although much of it occurs at night, is some- 
what different in its essential characteristics. Overtime 
means a long day; night work in its strict sense consists 
of a separate shift operating part or all of the night and 
leaving the individual free the remainder of the time. In 
some cases a part day and part night shift is operated. 
Night shifts in manufacturing establishments do not 
usually include children, but in at least two industries 
exceptions occur. In some of the glasshouses of Penn- 
sylvania boys work on a shift lasting ~éight~and three 
quarters or nine hours and operating from about five in 
the afternoon until after two in the early morning. The 
usual plan is to require the boys to alternate between day 
and night shifts. During one week a set of boys work 
on the day shift; during the next week they are required to 
engage in night work. The cotton industry has also re- 
quired regular night work of children. In nearly all North- 
ern states such work isnow forbidden, but in the South until 
very recently many of the cotton mills operated night 
shifts for children. Temporarily, and it will be hoped 
permanently, such night shifts have been abandoned in 
every Southern state except North Carolina, where a num- 
ber of mills still employ children at night. In the cotton 
mills, unfortunately, very small children have been used 
at night, whereas in the Pennsylvania glasshouses few 
boys under fourteen years are actually employed during 
the midnight hours. 
Another group of occupations in which injurious night 
work is carried on is the street_trades. The principal 
occupations are those of the newsboy and the messenger 
service. Both groups often carry on their work far into 
the night, and the newsboy is often on duty very early on 
Sunday mornings. Selling flowers and other small trinkets 
represents a minor form of the street trades.

180 CHILD PROBLEMS 
5. OVERTIME. 
Overtime employment, even in the states where fairly 
acceptable child labor laws are in operation, still continues. 
The principal occupations in which overtime for children 
is required are the seasonal trades. On account of the 
necessity of doing the major portion of the year’s work 
within a comparatively short time, these industries engage 
in overtime during a part of the year and operate on short 
time during the remainder. Among the trades in which 
children are largely represented and compelled to work 
overtime are: the paper-box industry, the confectionery 
trade, the canning and preserving of fruits and vegetables, 
artificial flower making, toy making, and, to a limited 
extent, the making of cotton and woolen goods. 
The period of overtime extends from a few days, as in 
some of the mercantile establishments, to three months, as 
in many candy factories. The amount of overtime is 
often excessive, and frequently children are employed 
thirteen or fourteen hours per day for three or four days 
per week. The majority of factories engaging in overtime 
limit themselves to not more than four nights per week. 
Although factories sometimes operate until ten o’clock, 
and in some instances on Sundays as well, the usual closing 
hour for overtime work is at or before nine p.m. In the 
cheaper stores in some cities the doors are not closed in the 
pre-Christmas season until very late in the evening —a 
limit of eleven-thirty p.m. having been recently reached 
in one large city ! 
6. Home Work. 
Child labor in the home is one of the most injurious forms 
in which the evil manifests itself. It usually degenerates 
into labor in the poorest tenements and under the worst 
housing conditions. The practice is usually confined to 
 
-P-A-G-E-187
De 
CONDITIONS OF CHILD LABOR 181 
the children of foreigners, especially Bohemians and Italians. 
The chief industries subject to this form of child labor 
are: artificial flower making, the making of white goods 
of various kinds, the clothing trade, and cigar and cigarette 
making. The chief evils of and difficulties in meeting 
this form of child labor are the following: — 
1. Hours are almost invariably excessive, and the wages 
of the children are absurdly low. 
2. Children of all ages from three to sixteen years have 
been found at work in these homes. 
3. Manufacturing is carried on in unlicensed homes 
because inspection can never be adequate and therefore 
homes escape investigation.
-P-A-G-E-188
CHAPTER III 
PHYSIOLOGICAL ASPECTS OF CHILD LABOR 
1. Importance or PuysicaAL DEvELOPMENT. 
The bad effect upon bodily growth and physiological 
development is one of the most important objections to 
child labor. Society must attempt to make the individual 
capable of self-support, and can not afford to incapacitate 
him by forcing him into premature employment. Death 
does not remove him as soon as he becomes a public charge, 
and the state must expend its energies to maintain him. 
The interests of society demand men and women of phys- 
ical vigor, therefore every effort should be made to develop 
the child into a strong, healthy person. 
In childhood the foundation is laid for strength, vigor, 
and general healthfulness. Activity is the keynote of 
this development, but this does not imply that the work 
of the factory will furnish the needed exercise. On the 
contrary, this is exactly what the factory fails to accom- 
plish. The vigorous man requires a symmetrical develop- 
ment, and this can be secured only by combining the use of 
all the five hundred muscles of the body. The self-chosen 
activities of the child are a better means of providing the 
necessary exercise than are the monotonous operations 
of the factory, and whatever interferes with his needed 
playtime, be it work, school, or sickness, handicaps him in 
his proper development. By means of play, exercise, out- 
door sports, and other similar activities, the child develops 
brain, nerves, and muscles, promotes a good circulation 
182

ERP Pe eh, Oey eee ATE ea ee eee ee

of the blood, and compels nature to provide a strong and 
adequate physical structure. Industrial capacity depends 
upon this development. 
2. Present PuysicaL REQUIREMENTS. 
The need of strong men and women in industry is greater 
than ever before. The domestic system did not sap the 
energies of men as does the strain of modern labor. Cer- 
tain diseases, such as apoplexy, heart disease, and Bright’s 
disease, are increasing their proportion of fatalities, and 
extreme longevity is becoming less common. Further- 
more, the stress of the factory and workshop shortens the 
trade life of thousands of laborers, and provision must be 
made for them in their old age. After the age of forty- 
five the individual who has not established himself or who 
loses his position has extreme difficulty in again adjusting 
himself favorably in the industrial system. Some firms 
will not engage the services of any new man who has at- 
tained this age, although they will retain their own em- 
ployees. Voluntary pension systems are springing up to 
care for many in their old age, but in not a few cases the 
aged are asked to resign. A significant movement has 
recently taken place in teaching circles, and one large 
university has made sixty-five the age limit for its pro- 
fessors. Upon reaching this age they are expected to 
resign. The trade life of the ordinary worker, is, however, 
much shorter than that of those engaged in professional 
‘work, and the average child worker may be expected to 
join the former class of laborers. There is a large group 
of confessedly dangerous trades, besides many others, 
which slowly undermine the strength and vitality of the 
worker. The average physical requirements of to-day 
are therefore much higher in all industries than they for- 
merly were. The comparative inefficiency of the foreigner 
unaccustomed to the muscle-producing American foods 
emphasizes the need of physical vigor.

3. Errecr or PREMATURE EMPLOYMENT. 
During the period of its growth the body of the child 
is more or less plastic. This susceptibility to external 
impressions, and the long years of plasticity, make the 
highest development possible, or under untoward circum- 
stances may cause the individual’s ruin. At the age of 
puberty the body undergoes a considerable transformation, 
and injuries often leave permanent effects. The boy is 
harmed by improper development, but the girl suffers 
more severely from the effects of unnatural activities at 
this period, and overstrain is especially dangerous. The 
muscles are easily affected at about the thirteenth year, 
as it is the period of their hardening, and excessive strain 
may produce a. tension which will prove permanently 
injurious. The child may also become dwarfed or stunted ; 
if so, almost unlimited effort will be required to induce 
development in later years. The physical decline of the 
English people, which resulted in lower requirements for 
enlistment in the British army during the Boer War, is in 
large measure attributed to the former presence of child 
labor and to inferior housing conditions of large numbers 
of the English people. The seeds of child labor yield a 
harvest of physical degenerates. The working child tends. 
to become anemic, and the various organs of his body 
receive insufficient nourishment. Muscles in certain 
parts of the body are over-developed ; while others, owing 
to their weakness and lack of exercise, fail to develop, and 
the child becomes deformed. Work, as carried on in mod- 
ern industry, can not perform the beneficent function of 
play. 
4. IncipenTaL Resuits or Camp Lazor. 
Certain specific conditions of child labor are specially 
harmful. The constant standing to which many children 
 
-P-A-G-E-191

are subjected is often the cause of very injurious results. 
And in some industries girls are often compelled to stand 
for hours at a time —a tension which frequently is the 
cause of much harm. Besides acquiring flatfoot and 
placing excessive strain upon certain muscles, the girl 
frequently suffers from internal derangements. In the 
candy and paper-box factories, as well as in many textile 
mills, standing is common, while in stores small girls are 
almost invariably on their feet, although moving to and 
fro. The bundle wrappers often stand in one spot all day. 
Rest while at work depends upon a change in position 
and in the use of a new set of muscles so as to allow the 
wearied ones to recover from their fatigue. For this 
reason constant sitting is nearly as laborious and tiresome 
as the standing posture, and frequently involves a cramped 
position which injures the lungs and prevents the full and 
free development of the chest. The workers subjected to 
these conditions are very susceptible to the various lung 
diseases. The cramped position which constant sitting 
necessitates also tends to deform the growing child. 
5. UNHEALTHFUL OccUPATIONS. 
Certain industries are by nature injurious to the worker 
and especially to the plastic child. Among these are cer- 
tain industries in which a large amount of dust is formed. 
The boys working in the breakers of our coal mines are 
continually compelled to breathe the black dust in which 
they are enveloped. In a short time their lungs are so 
filled with dust that they turn completely black, and the 
constant presence of this foreign substance undoubtedly 
interferes with the free function of the lungs and retards 
the full development of the child. Many stunted and 
unreasonably small boys are found at work in the coal 
regions of Pennsylvania. 
In the textile mills the lint and dust are noticeably
-P-A-G-E-192
  186 CHILD PROBLEMS 
injurious, and the best of mills can not entirely escape the 
presence of these substances. Artificial methods of allay- 
ing the dust and of minimizing the diffusion of lint through- 
out the air have accomplished much toward the creation 
of an unpolluted atmosphere, but mills should likewise 
refuse to employ small and young children. The cotton 
lint may be undiscernible in the air, but its presence is 
indicated by a deposit of the substance upon stationary 
objects. The air is breathed by the children, the lint pene- 
trates to the lungs, and can with difficulty be thrown off 
by them. Therefore the child is bound to suffer physically 
from this admittedly injurious substance. The initial 
processes in the manufacture of goods from flax and hemp 
occasion a vast quantity of dust, and much of the pre- 
liminary work is done by children. Often the workers are 
surrounded by a cloud of dust which irritates the throat 
and bronchial tubes. The wool dust is especially harmful, 
but recent industrial improvements have greatly dimin- 
ished its deleterious consequences in the better grade of 
mills. The dust of the tobacco leaf is injurious, because 
it contains a poisonous substance. A large number of 
children are found in tobacco factories in the North and 
the South, and the occupations pursued require the con- 
stant breathing of this poisonous fume. The principal 
effects of the dust on the child are the development of 
nervous affections and of nausea, the latter condition re- 
sulting more frequently among girls than among boys. 
A predisposition to disease is also developed, and even 
adults suffer from the effects of work, in tobacco factories, 
many of which are most unsanitary. This is especially 
true of the smaller shops where the under-aged child is 
so frequently found. Injurious dusts are common in mills 
. of various kinds, and in all cases the child suffers more 
severely than the adult worker because of physical im- 
maturity.
-P-A-G-E-193
PHYSIOLOGICAL ASPECTS OF CHILD LABOR 187 
  Rapid variations in temperature produce baneful con- 
sequences. Such changes are common in the glasshouses, 
in which boys are frequently employed. Some of the boys 
work close by the furnaces, and are continually subjected 
to the fierce heat, while others run to and fro and thus 
alternate between currents of hot and moderate air. The 
excessive heat, the cooler air, and the drafts, combine to 
undermine the health of the boys. In some factories, such 
as confectionery establishments, certain rooms are heated 
or cooled to specifically required temperatures and the 
child does his work at that constant temperature. The 
cool rooms are the more unhealthful, as the girl employed 
does not usually exercise the necessary precautions re- 
quired to protect her against the cold; and the change 
from one level of temperature to another is likewise fraught 
with dangers. Many textile mills are overheated and pro- 
duce debilitating effects, and the majority of laundries 
are necessarily warmer than the outside air. Children 
can not escape the heat of the laundry, and the dislike of 
many employees to allow the drafts to handicap them in 
their work often results in insufficient ventilation. In the 
summer months frequent faintings occur on account of the 
heat, both children and young women suffering from this 
misfortune. Fans and ventilators in the better class of 
laundries now diminish the harmful effects of excessive 
heat. Over-exertion in the heat of glasshouses or laun- 
dries is an especial danger of the summer months, and 
many laundries operate a longer day during the summer 
than during the cooler months. 
Moisture is another cause of physical discomfort. Dr. 
Sewall, in her investigations, found barefooted girls in 
some of the flax-spinning rooms, while in others the girls 
wore rubbers to protect themselves from the wet floors.! In

No. 52.

  188 CHILD PROBLEMS 
bleacheries, half-naked boys were trampling cloth in deep 
vats, and in the bottling department of one brewery the 
boys wore rubber boots. In another, wooden shoes were 
used. In some laundries the moisture is drawn off by 
means of hoods, and thus the bad effect of steam is miti- 
gated. 
Aside from the tobacco industry, few children are en- 
gaged in occupations bringing them in contact with very 
poisonous substances. The extreme susceptibility of the 
child to such substances has generally kept child labor from 
these industries. In dye-houses or in establishments where 
dyeing forms one of the occupations boys are occasionally 
found. Here they are required to use coloring matter 
of various kinds for artificial flowers, and for certain pro- 
cesses in textile mills. In some enameling works the use 
of lead is an unhealthful element. Varnish and paint also 
injure the young child. In many trades children suffer 
severely from accidents resulting from their natural care- 
lessness. It is true that many times children do not appear 
to be injured from factory life, but are nevertheless physi- 
cally affected and later reap the results. 
6. Errecr or Niaur Work. 
The physiological. disadvantage of night work is far 
greater than that of employment during the day. This 
applies especially to indoor work, although night work 
in the street trades is also a cause of physical depletion. 
The night work which takes the form of overtime is harm- 
ful because of the long hours which are usually involved. 
Tn this case the injurious effects are serious because recoy- 
ery from extreme exhaustion is proportionally more diffi- 
cult than from ordinary weariness. The bad effect of long 
hours is cumulative. The first obstacle which the night 
worker encounters is the difficulty of habituating himself 
to the unnatural change. Night work is not in accordance
-P-A-G-E-195
PE ee ee Re ee a ae ee 
PHYSIOLOGICAL ASPECTS OF CHILD LABOR 189 
with the wish of nature, and the individual profits best by 
using the night for purposes of sleep. Daylight does not 
lend itself to efficient rest. The air is full of noises, and 
boys can not entirely isolate themselves from all disturbing 
factors. Because they can not sleep they are out again by 
noon engaged in play or sport. Some time must elapse 
Nig cfore the child can train himself to sleep sufficiently during 
the day to meet his needs. Where the same child alter- 
nates weekly between day and night shifts, as he does in 
some Pennsylvania glasshouses, time is not given to adjust 
himself to the ever-changing conditions. Therefore his 
physical energy is slowly sapped, and injurious results follow. 
Night work also invariably involves the use of artificial 
light, and confinement to its use is measurably harmful. 
The custom in some factories of operating only part of the 
night results in turning the factory hands out in the very 
middle of the night, and the change for the young boys is 
often distinctly unfavorable. The child who works at 
night is generally less efficient than the child who works 
an equal number of hours during the daytime. This 
inefficiency is a sign of physical injury. The abandon- 
ment of night work by many manufacturing establishments 
is in part due to the recognition of its inherent disadvan- 
tages, and the enactment of laws forbidding child labor in 
the factories at night is a further indication of this point 
of view.   7. Risums. 
The emphasis which is being increasingly piaced upon 
good physique, and the growing need of this qualification, 
demonstrates the importance of the consideration of the 
physiological effects of child labor. For in this phase of 
the problem lies much of the rationale of stringent child 
labor laws. Premature employment during the day or 
employment at night paves the way for those physical 
.

disabilities which result in an early incapacity for self- 
support, or in excesses of divers kinds which hasten the 
breakdown of the individual. The conservation of energy 
and the production of the best types of physical vigor are 
inexorably necessary in the complicated civilization of to- 
day. Both economic and social conditions require high 
standards of physique, and the following summary of the, 
physiological effects of child labor will indicate the various 
results which must be prevented if we are to retain a vig- 
orous manhood and womanhood. 
1. Physical development is retarded or entirely stopped. 
2. The muscles remain weak, anemic conditions ensue, 
and nervous excitability results. 
8. Cramping leads to tuberculosis or insufficient chest 
development. 
4. Certain postures produce lateral curvature of the 
spine. 
5. Pelvic disorders occur among the girls who are sub- 
jected to constant standing. : 
6. Slow devitalization follows the inhalation of poisonous * 
substances. 
7. The child does not develop symmetrically, and de- 
formities follow. 
8. In night work all the bad conditions of the day are 
aggravated.

       CHAPTER IV 
GENERAL EFFECTS OF CHILD LABOR 
1. Inrropuction. 
The original opposition to child labor was largely based 
on humanitarian motives. The horrible conditions which 
formerly prevailed finally determined sympathetic men 
to abolish the atrocious system. The economists at first 
opposed its abolition on account of the reputed detriment 
to the industries affected, but later they discovered an 
economic justification for such legislation. This evolution 
first took place in England, but in the United States an 
almost similar development occurred. Here the original 
attitude toward child labor was the exact opposite of the 
one held to-day. When our manufacturing enterprises 
began to spring up in the Eastern states, it was generally 
believed that industry could be made more productive 
and children more useful by their employment in gainful 
occupations, especially in the manufacture of textiles. 
The cotton and woolen mills therefore soon began to swarm 
with little children called from the farms and small towns 
of New England. The wages received were absurdly low, 
but this agreeable desideratum made the business more 
profitable to the capitalist! In 1812 many children were 
employed at less than a half dollar per week, but by 1832 
boys in the cotton mills commonly received $1.75 for a 
week’s work. Our legislators were more interested in 
the needs of industry than in those of the child; there- 
fore they directly encouraged child labor. 
191
-P-A-G-E-198
192 CHILD PROBLEMS 
The labor of the child under the domestic system differed 
essentially from present labor in the factory or in the tene- 
ments, but this contrast was not appreciated by the early 
economists or the American statesmen of the beginning 
of the nineteenth century. The requisites for economic 
survival were likewise different then from the requisites 
of to-day and child labor was less detrimental in its social 
effects. A strong impetus was therefore given to the em- 
ployment of children wherever they could be used. Com- 
pulsory education had not yet dawned, and women were 
denied the opportunity of acquiring any considerable de- * 
gree of learning. Consequently no impelling motive existed 
to prevent the child from entering some gainful occupation. 
Changing social standards have now awakened the Amer- 
ican people to the seriousness of the child labor problem. 
2. Economic Cost or Cuinp Lasor. 
The economic disadvantage of child labor is self-evident, 
consequently the subject only needs elaboration along 
certain lines. One of the direct economic effects of child 
labor is a shortening of the period of trade life, owing to the 
physical depletion which results from premature labor 
in factories and insanitary workshops. As has been shown 
in another chapter, the present conditions of industry are 
such that the boy who begins to work at an early age will 
be unable to endure the strain of industry as long as the 
child not subjected to premature toil. It is important, 
therefore, that such precautionary measures be taken as 
will offer the greatest opportunity for an extension by 
every individual of his industrial career. Child labor draws 
prematurely upon our economic assets, and thus diminishes 
the amount of available labor power. By employing the 
labor before it is mature an earlier yield upon the investment 
will be realized, but the human being will be exhausted so 
much sooner that great harm will have been done and the 
 
-P-A-G-E-199
OO _ U’“B 
GENERAL EFFECTS OF CHILD LABOR 193 
total trade life will be actually shorter. The economic 
loss caused by this handicap depends upon two results : 
the death of the child or of the worker in middle life, or 
the disablement of the child through accident, which may 
cause partial or total incapacity for work. The mortality 
of children in a number of industries, such as cotton and 
glass manufacture, is too high, and obviously is caused in 
part by their employment, although precise statistics on 
the subject have not yet been collaborated. The economic 
loss due to a higher mortality can not be replaced. 
Accident asan economic cost is receiving greater attention 
as the appalling loss of human life in industry is becoming 
better known. The child is more prone to accidents than 
the adult, and will suffer even in industries regarded as 
comparatively safe. Young boys and girls are naturally 
careless, and are frequently the victims of accidents which 
maim them for life and lessen their economic capacity. 
The accident rate for girls has been shown to be especially 
high. Children are allowed or compelled to tend machines 
requiring the utmost care of the adult operator, and serious 
injury becomes almost inevitable. The danger is often 
the greatest for the very class least capable of declining 
to accept hazardous employment. Several states, includ- 
ing Illinois and Missouri, have enacted laws forbidding the 
employment of children in certain occupations in which 
danger from accidents is considerable. Few states, how- 
ever, have enacted other than general laws prohibiting 
the employment of children in dangerous occupations. 
Unless the industries are specified, such laws have but 
little value. 
The general physiological effects of premature employ- 
ment all operate to lessen the economic efficiency of the 
individual. These effects, as has been shown, may be 
of a varied character. Whether they result in deformity, 
stunted physique, weak internal organs, or in some other 
° 
 
-P-A-G-E-200
194 CHILD PROBLEMS 
defect, the result is uniform — a loss of capacity for work 
and an early retirement from the industrial field. An- 
other economic effect of child labor is the low efficiency 
of the child owing to a failure to receive proper training 
and education. The child necessarily enters industry 
without having acquired a trade education. He there- 
fore joins the ranks of unskilled labor. He may be re- 
quired to perform the routine work of a very simple occu- 
pation in which he may acquire remarkable skill and 
dexterity. If he has patience, and the monotony is not 
too oppressive, he may be successful for a time, but his 
specialization is so extreme that no other employments 
are open to him in case of sudden dismissal from his occu- 
pation. Child labor therefore promotes a division of 
labor which under our present system has already been 
carried too far for the best interests of the working classes. 
Child labor means untrained and unstable labor. Mo- 
notonous work and extreme specialization are inherently 
contrary to the natural and spontaneous activities of the 
child. Unless some superior coercive foree —a parent’s 
insistence, the absolute needs of the child, or some similar 
force — compels him, he will not remain in the same 
position for more than a very short period. The young 
child belongs to the floating class of workers, and this is 
especially true of the boy. Yet his need of a definite trade 
is more urgent than that of the young girl, whose entire 
industrial career, owing to marriage and subsequent retire- 
ment from industry, is limited to about five years. The 
untrained child can not know his own mind, so simply 
drifts along until dire necessity forces him to begin to con- 
centrate his efforts on a single industry. Meanwhile he 
has lost several years of time, and his opportunity for an 
education is gone. Therefore he soon reaches the limit 
of his earning capacity, and does not contribute to society 
the values which would be expected from him if he were 
. 
 
-P-A-G-E-201
pe he ethene Re cat Ee en 
GENERAL EFFECTS OF CHILD LABOR 195 
trained. Investigations in Massachusetts and also in sev- 
eral large cities indicate that the untrained child suffers 
an enormous handicap. Although for a short time he may 
outstrip his trained associate in earning power, this ad- 
vantage is quickly lost. The latter may gain an indefinite 
increase of wages or salary, but the former must always 
remain among the wage-earning classes. The net result 
of the entrance of children into industry is a positive cur- 
tailment of the wealth-producing power of the nation. 
3. Socrat Costs. 
The social consequences of premature employment 
can not be measured in any material form, but are never- 
theless a serious menace to our national welfare. Child 
labor hardens the successful child laborer to the evils of the 
system. Accordingly the very men who should be strong- 
est in their advocacy of progressive laws are precisely the 
men who look backward and do not struggle for the interests 
of the child of to-day. Child labor, however, oppresses 
the great majority of working children, and, while an ad- 
vantage to the few, is a great social waste. Society suffers 
because the individuals subjected to child labor can not 
realize the full amplitude of their powers. Not only is 
the loss occasioned an economic disadvantage, but race 
deterioration is threatened. In addition, the child has 
no opportunity to develop his full mental powers. A loss 
results to him in the limitation of his social opportunities 
and to society in its failure to receive the best contribution 
of which the child would have been capable. 
Child labor debars the individual from acquiring an 
adequate education, and thus handicaps him in his effi- 
ciency as a citizen. Many working children are illiterate ; 
others have so little education that almost no advantage 
can result. The demands of the state are becoming in- 
creasingly urgent, and every reasonable effort should be
-P-A-G-E-202
a 
196 CHILD PROBLEMS 
made to equip every boy and girl for the duties of citizen- 
ship. Successful citizenship requires intelligent appli- 
cation of the powers which education develops in the’ 
individual. Child labor is a serious bar to this achieve- 
ment. The usefulness of the American citizen is achieved 
only by time and education. Unfitness for the social and 
political life of to-day therefore follows in the wake of 
child labor, and the citizenship of our country is thereby 
- endangered. Few child workers, when grown, attain to 
positions of prominence or become factors in directing ‘our 
civilization. Incapacity relegates them to the lower 
classes. 
The curtailment of the earning power of the individual 
on account of the handicap which child labor imposes 
results in a relative incapacity to rise in the scale of living. 
Thus the problem of poverty is accentuated, standards 
of living fail to rise, and the dependent classes increase in 
numbers. Without the needed moral, industrial, and 
trade education, the young worker likewise is unable to 
use adequate foresight, he can not codperate so successfully 
with others, and the benefits accruing from organized labor 
can not be fully realized. 
4. Morat Errects. 
The demoralizing effects of child labor depend largely 
upon the baneful influence of night work and that of the 
street trades. The direct consequences of work in the 
stores and factories are less patent unless such work is 
carried on for an unreasonable number of hours. The 
morals imparted by the street trades should emphatically 
condemn the use of children as street venders; yet these 
trades have been the most successful ones in their resistance 
of preventive legislation. The small boy selling papers 
on the streets easily degenerates into the beggar, especially 
if he plies his trade at night when his artifices meet with 
 
-P-A-G-E-203
ee Ee ee ee ee ee ee Le Teer a Teen Tne ae ee 
GENERAL EFFECTS OF CHILD LABOR 197 
- a greater degree of success. Both practice in begging and 
in methods of deceit tend to demoralize him and prepare 
him for the juvenile court. Investigation has shown that 
a vast majority of the newsboys are not compelled to enter 
industry to maintain a livelihood, but do so because of the 
attractions and adventures of the business. Demoraliza- 
tion, therefore, is easy and rapid. Both the newsboy and 
the messenger boy are particularly exposed to the seduc- 
tions of vice. The associations of the bad men of the * 
street are pernicious and induce immoral habits and even 
sexual vice, but the influences of the saloon and the houses 
of prostitution are doubly vicious in their power to deprave 
the child. In many cities the newsboy does not hesitate 
to enter saloons in the pursuit of his trade, and frequently 
he visits the haunts of vice and himself becomes infected 
with serious disease. In a large parental school, it was 
recently ascertained that of the newsboys who were in- 
mates, one third were suffering from disease caused by 
immorality. Also that the newsboy was considerably 
below the normal standards of stature and weight. In 
another large institution for delinquent children, the « 
newsboys form 40 per cent of all the boys who had pre- 
viously been gainfully employed. The boys make the 
acquaintance of bad women, they become steeled to de- 
grading sights, and are often thoroughly trained for a 
career of vice. 
Employees in the messenger service are specially subject 
to the pernicious influences of the immoral districts of the 
city. They are often compelled to deliver messages at un- 
reasonable hours and in localities which are clearly de- 
moralizing, and they therefore form close associations with 
vice. There is a large percentage of juvenile delinquency 
among the members of the messenger service, and in at 
least one prominent reformatory for boys the representa- 
tives of this trade outnumber those of any other occupa-  
-P-A-G-E-204
rename ee 8 
198 CHILD PROBLEMS 
tion. The girl employed in this service suffers from the 
greatest moral temptations, but the recognition of this fact 
has prompted several states to prohibit such employment 
of girls unless they are at least eighteen years of age. In 
some states similar attempts to save the boys have been 
’ made by prohibiting them from entering any questionable 
resort to which they may be compelled to carry messages. 
The latter provision, however, has little deterring power. 
The street trades‘also lend themselves to the oppor- 
tunity for gaming, and a number of games which develop 
the gambling habit are very popular. The newsboy enjoys 
a large amount of leisure, and therefore is an active par- 
ticipant in these questionable games. Shooting craps, 
throwlttg dice, and even policy playing, are some of the 
games which develop the gambling instinct in the boys 
of the street. The pennies which fall into their hands 
through the work of the day are often lost again by. their 
unsuccessful contest in the petty gambling in which they 
engage. This loss, however, is less serious than thesper- 
manent injury to their character and the inculcation of 
the baser instincts. ‘ 
Some of the street trades are anefficient cause of truancy, 
and wherever truancy laws are not properly enforced the 
street trades become a refuge for the wayward boy. Tru- 
ancy and these trades are complementary activities. The 
truant deceives by entering one of these occupations, 
oping thus to escape the compulsion of the schoolroom, 
and the devotee of the street becomes irregular in school 
attendance or habitually practices truancy. Such irregu- 
larity unfits the boy for concentrated efforts in any legiti- 
mate line. The reputed demands of his trade enable the 
newsboy to assume a certain unwholesome air of inde- 
pendence, which, if persisted in, leads to morally injurious 
consequences. This tends to lessen the control of parents 
over their children, but a relaxation of such control makes 
 
-P-A-G-E-205
  
  ee ne Oe es eee eee ay Re eee eee ae eee Te yee ae eee 
GENERAL EFFECTS OF CHILD LABOR 199 
the recovery of parental authority well-nigh impossible. 
Consequently we witness a growing number of incorrigible 
and disorderly children. These forms of child labor are 
not entirely responsible for this growing evil, but are a large 
factor in its development. The street trades leave the 
child with little or no direct supervision by his employers, 
yet no working child can develop morally and spiritually 
in a satisfactory manner unless he is subjected to right 
discipline. The newsboy, however, frequently operates 
under the immediate control of overseers, whose influence 
can hardly be uplifting. If the parent loses control, the 
. boy in the street trades practically escapes moral discipline. 
In this respect the boy or girl in factory or workshop has 
an immense advantage because the restraints imposed by 
employers are rigid and certainly tend to induce regularity, 
industry, and obedience. 
Night work in factories has several important moral 
consequences. The discipline of the factory or of the 
store tends to greater leniency at night and therefore the - 
children will be more given to excesses. A factory in- 
spector in a prominent state claims that the behavior of 
children in factories at night is noticeably worse than 
during the day. The long hours of the child make him 
restless, and the different conditions at night urge him 
to throw off restraints, and hence demoralizing tendencies 
follow. Night work in the glasshouses undoubtedly has 
an injurious effect upon the boys. Contact with adult 
workers tends to become demoralizing, but the tendency is 
more marked at night. Smoking and drinking habits are 
formed by the boys, and profanity is acquired. The child 
on the street at midnight, whether a newsboy or a factory 
employee on his way to or from work, can hardly escape 
moral degradation. The moral danger of night work 
to girls consists chiefly in the pernicious contacts with the 
baser elements of the street. The sensibilities are easily
-P-A-G-E-206
  200 CHILD PROBLEMS 
blunted by the environment which the street creates for 
the working girl. A pretty as well as useful custom among 
many Italians requires that the Italian girls, if compelled 
to remain at work after nightfall, shall not be allowed to 
pass through the streets without a companion or chaperone. 
In practice this custom enables them to evade the teasing 
and bantering to which the lone girl or group of girls are 
- subjected when on the streets at night. These insults 
to girls are common, even to those who are quietly return- 
ing to their homes. In the early morning the young girl 
must run the gauntlet of curious eyes and provoki.g 
familiarities. Girls need to be saved from this danger of 
the street, but the continuation of overtime or the use of 
night work renders this quite impossible. Although not 
necessarily a cause of juvenile delinquency, it does weaken 
the moral strength of the individual. 
In extenuation of the moral effects of child labor it can 
justly be urged that in some cases at least the child has 
been taken from a bad street environment and placed 
under discipline in the factory. Child labor is a school, 
however, to this extent only — it may occasionally put a 
child where degrading influences are less aggressive. 
Even this slight extenuation can not in any sense apply 
to the street trades. Society should not allow either the 
opportunity for mischievous associations, or the child 
labor which sometimes becomes the substitute. More edu- 
cation, more parks and playgrounds, and better homes, 
not more child labor, are the remedies for the bad influences 
of the street. ~*

  CHAPTER V 
. CHILD LABOR LEGISLATION 
1. Evotution or LEGISLATION. 
"A perfect child labor law is only a theoretical possibility. 
In a dynamic society no absolute adjustment to conditions 
can be made. A law must therefore be suitably revised 
from time to time to meet the new conditions that arise. 
The recent industrial history of England and of the United 
States illustrates this fact, for the laws of to-day are so radi- 
cal that they could not even have been considered fifty 
years ago. Yet few, if any, American child labor laws 
are really socially adequate at the present time. The 
increasing complexity of our social relations, the changing 
requisites for social and industrial survival, and the ethical 
necessity of an adaptation to the needs of the present de- 
mand a rapid evolution in appropriate legislation. Exist- 
ing laws will probably be considered quite inadquate 
within a shorter time than has elapsed since serious at- 
tempts to enact child labor laws at all were first made. 
           
                
   2. Aamncies Supportine LEGISLATION. 
The majority of the recent child labor laws of the dif- 
ferent states have been enacted since 1895. Before that 
time the principal legislation against the employment of 
children related to certain dangerous and immoral occupa- 
tion? In point of time we have lagged far behind Great 
Britain, but our progress has been more rapid, and some of

202 CHILD PROBLEMS 
ment of industry has accentuated the problem, conse- 
quently private organizations have advocated a program 
of good legislation and with favorable results. The most 
capable societies of this kind have been the child labor 
committees. The National Child Labor Committee was 
organized in 1904 and has carried its propaganda into 
every state in which the problem has assumed a menacing 
aspect. Its work consists of investigating the conditions 
of child labor, of educating the public through pamphlets, 
public addresses, etc., and of trying to secure child labor 
legislation, especially in the states most in need of better 
laws. In many of the states local child labor committees 
assist the national organization in its untiring fight for 
better legislation. Much of the recent progress is due to 
the efforts of these private societies. 
Good legislation has been fostered by other agencies,” 
notably labor unions, women’s trade union leagues, con- 
sumers’ leagues, women’s clubs of various kinds, mis- 
cellaneous associations, and state labor bureaus. The 
consumers’ leagues of the United States through their 
method of organizing consumers and of insisting on the 
manufacture and sale of products under good labor condi- 
tions can be made a powerful factor in raising the standards 
of public opinion. State labor bureaus have in a number 
of instances drafted bills for presentation to the state 
legislatures, and have had considerable success in securing 
their passage. Unfortunately they have not always stood 
for the best and most modern legislation, and therefore the 
results of their efforts have not been sufficiently favorable. 
Even the manufacturers have in several cases passed 
resolutions favoring some restrictions of child labor, and 
_have thus imposed higher standards upon themselves, 
The creation of sentiment’ and the enactment of satisfac- 
tory child labor laws depend largely upon the work of or- 
ganizations specially interested in children.

3. Unirormity or Laws. 
A serious handicap to adequate legislation in the United 
States is the right of each state to enact its own child labor 
laws. A great variety of laws has been the natural con- 
sequence. This enables the employers affected by pro- 
posed legislation to threaten to abandon the states in which 
their establishments are located and to continue business 
elsewhere. State selfishness and the desire to build up 
local interests are forces of such magnitude that the state 
hesitates to enact legislation which may drive capital from 
within its borders. With free trade among our states, 
uniform laws are necessary to render industry stable. 
So far each state has acted independently, hence child 
labor laws have not been highly effective. 
The federal government has been negligent in its legis- 
lation against child labor. It has supreme control of the 
territories and the District of Columbia, and has recently 
enacted an inferior child labor law for the latter. The 
government should have passed a model law which the 
states could advantageously copy. The prohibition of 
child labor in the states by the federal government may 
be unconstitutional, at least all efforts to accomplish such 
legislation have failed. A bill introduced in the Fifty-ninth 
Congress provided that interstate commerce in products 
in the manufacture of which children under fourteen years 
of age participated should be illegal. Had this measure 
passed and been sustained by our courts as constitutional, 
it would at once have secured a large degree of uniformity 
of child labor conditions throughout the United States, 
and the backward states would have been compelled to 
raise their age limits for the employment of children. 
Other methods for securing uniformity are interstate 
child labor conferences. Such conferences, however, can 
only recommend, and the different states may utterly 
    
-P-A-G-E-210
204 CHILD PROBLEMS 
ignore the sentiments of such a congress. The reform 
forces are seldom united, while the opponents of good 
legislation usually act in perfect unison with each other. 
The education of the people to a realization of what con- 
stitutes proper standards is necessary to establish uniform 
legislation. The pressure of opinion can then be exerted in 
the states requiring better laws, and eventually a fair 
degree of uniformity can be obtained. 
4. A Move. Law. 
A model child labor law for all time can not be proposed. 
Although laws should be subject to revision when occasion 
demands, several important requisites are fundamental 
to an acceptable law. Among these are: first, the law 
must be clear and distinct in its meaning, so as to permit of 
but one interpretation. Confusion in this respect is often 
a ground for its non-enforcement. “Second, enforceability 
is basic. Unless the law can be applied in an expedient 
manner and properly enforced, its very presence on the 
statute books may prove harmful. Third, the law must 
conform to the requirements of the social interests which 
are involved. A new plane of ideals will have been estab- 
lished, and the ethical progress evidenced in the law can 
then be generalized. The critical sections of a child labor 
law relate to the questions of : number of hours of work per 
day and week, the age limits, night work, methods of 
securing certificates, previous education required, and the 
provisions for enforcement. A child labor law should be 
comprehensive and cover employment in all factories, 
workshops, mercantile establishments, laundries, hotels, 
restaurants, and the telegraph and messenger service, as 
well as in the sale of newspapers. Agricultural labor may 
be omitted in so far as such labor does not interfere with 
appropriate compulsory education laws. 
The laws most nearly approximating a model child 
 
-P-A-G-E-211
  CHILD LABOR LEGISLATION 205 
labor law are found in New York and Illinois. On the 
other hand, the most unsatisfactory laws are those of 
North Carolina, South Carolina, and Alabama. In the 
North, Pennsylvania still fails to meet reasonable require- 
ments. 
5. Hours or Lasor. 
In several states, notably New York and Illinois, the 
hours of work in factories are limited to eight. per day or 
forty-eight per week. In New York the work must fall 
between the hours of 8 A.M. and 5 p.m., and the law there- 
fore enjoys the advantage of effective enforceability. In 
Illinois the eight hours of work may occur any time between 
7 a.m. and 7 p.m. When such leeway is allowed, enforce- 
ment of law becomes difficult, and all employers should 
be required to post the exact hours when children are 
expected to work, and also to furnish the bureau of factory 
inspection with similar information. Then if any child 
is found at work at some time other than that indicated 
in the schedule, a violation of law is to be presumed. In 
several Western states, child labor in the mines is limited 
to eight hours per day, but in Colorado the law applies 
to factories and stores as well. 
Only a few states have established a nine-hour day for 
children, and the majority of laws allow ten hours as a 
standard day. This does not in all cases imply a sixty- 
hour week, for several New England states allow only 
fifty-eight, while New Jersey permits but fifty-five. The 
state of North Carolina allows children to work twelve 
hours per day and sixty-six per week, and stands at the 
foot of the series of states having regulations on this sub- 
ject. Pennsylvania also allows a twelve-hour day, but 
its weekly limit of sixty hours either results in uniform 
days of shorter length or in an alternation of long and 
short days. In a number of states a distinction is made
-P-A-G-E-212
206 CHILD PROBLEMS 
between manufacturing and mercantile establishments, 
longer or unlimited hours being allowed in the latter. No 
working child should be allowed to labor more than eight 
hours per day, nor more than forty-eight hours per week, 
and both limitations should be specified in order that Sun- 
day labor may be abolished. Some industries operate 
seven days per week, but society should permit no child to 
be overworked in this manner. 
6. Nicgut Work. 
Night work can hardly be prevented unless a closing 
hour is set. In factories and mercantile establishments 
no children should be allowed to work later than 7 p.m. 
In the industries exempted from child labor laws a con- 
siderable amount of night work prevails. In Alabama 
night work of children between thirteen and sixteen years 
of age is permitted by law, but restricted to forty-eight 
hours per week. Several states allow night work for chil- 
dren over fourteen. At present night work is specifically 
prohibited in twenty-three states, but the age limit varies, 
although in the majority of cases it is sixteen. The legal 
efforts to abolish night work of children in the glasshouses 
of Pennsylvania have failed. Six states prohibit night 
work in factories before 7 a.m. or after 7 p.m. for children 
under sixteen, and in several cases the law applies to all 
gainful occupations, except agriculture and the street 
trades. Five additional ones have similar regulations for 
children under fourteen. In nearly all of the remaining 
states where closing hours are limited by laws, an un- 
necessarily late hour is allowed, some states setting the 
limit at ten o’clock. Night work in the messenger service 
and the newsboys’ trade is almost unrestricted, but should _ 
be limited to 8 p.m for all children under sixteen years of 
age. Under present conditions actual night work is most 
common in the street trades and the seasonal industries. 
 
-P-A-G-E-213
  CHILD LABOR LEGISLATION 207 
7. Ace Limits. 
The history of child labor legislation shows that the age 
limits of the working child have gradually been raised. 
When England first agitated the problem, little children 
not more than five years of age were found in her factories. 
In certain canning factories in New York and in parts of 
the South children not more than six or seven years of age 
have until recently been used in industry, although not 
appearing on the pay-rolls. The minimum age limit for 
working children must vary from time to time and must 
depend upon existing social and industrial conditions. 
Most American child labor laws have adopted the four- 
teenth year as a proper age limit, and this should be the 
minimum requirement for a model law. In a number of 
Southern states a minimum age limit of twelve years is 
allowed. The practice in some states of allowing children 
of twelve to enter certain occupations during the summer 
vacation is probably justifiable. Poverty exemptions 
such as those allowed in South Carolina, Arkansas, Mis- 
souri, and Alabama, where children under twelve years of 
age may be employed in case of dependent parents are an 
infringement upon the rights of children. Under certain 
conditions newsboys twelve years of age or.over should 
be allowed to sell papers, but such employment must not 
interfere with the educational requirements of the law. In 
the near future the minimum working age should be raised 
to fifteen years. At present no children between the ages 
of fourteen and sixteen should be allowed to enter manu- 
facturing or mercantile establishments without having 
first secured a working certificate. There is a growing ten- 
dency to prohibit children under sixteen from entering“ 
* dangerous occupations, including mining, and to exclude 
the illiterate child from gainful employment.
-P-A-G-E-214
208 CHILD PROBLEMS 
8. Worxine Papmrs. 
The purpose of requiring all children between fourteen 
and sixteen years of age to obtain working papers is to 
guard against the admission of applicants who are not 
socially justified in beginning a career as wage-earners. 
Without certain prerequisites no child should be granted 
a permit to work. Such a permit should contain satis- 
factory evidence in regard to the age, education, and phys- 
ical qualifications of the child. Proof of age should depend 
largely upon certificates of birth and baptism, supplemented 
by the records of the school which the applicant has at- 
tended. The statement of the parent is not sufficient in 
itself, as perjury is not uncommon in the localities where 
only the affidavit of parents is necessary to obtain certifi- 
cates. In such places a sort of traffic in working papers 
is carried on. Often the same paper descends from one 
member of the family to another. Children frequently 
lie about their ages, having been carefully coached either 
by their parents or by their employers. No matter how 
small the boy or how tiny the girl, on inquiry the inter- 
rogator learns that the child is fourteen years of age! In 
thirteen states the affidavit of the parent is accepted as 
sufficient evidence of the age of the child. North Carolina 
merely provides that the parent shall furnish the establish- 
ment with a written statement of the age of the child and a 
certificate of school attendance, four months of schooling 
in the previous twelve months being also required. 
Apart from the affidavit system, several methods of 
granting working papers are in operation in the different 
states. The certificates may be granted by the school 
* authorities, by factory inspectors, by boards of health, 
or: by judges of county, municipal, or juvenile courts. 
Fourteen of the eighteen states which require written 
proof of the age of the child place the duty of granting 
 
-P-A-G-E-215
  CHILD LABOR LEGISLATION 209 
certificates in the hands of the school authorities. The 
very efficient laws of Illinois and Massachusetts make 
this provision. School records are usually faithful and re- 
liable sources of information, although the direct record of 
the birth of the child, if that can be procured, is a still safer 
proof of age. In New York the papers must be signed by 
an official of the board of health, who shall not approve 
them unless a properly signed school record of the child 
has been filed, as well as a record of his birth or baptism. 
In default of the latter the affidavit of the parent is re- 
quired. This complex system makes the issuing of papers 
to under-aged children almost impossible. In several 
states, including Wisconsin and Missouri, the factory 
inspectors issue the certificates, and in these two states 
very successful work has been accomplished. On the 
other hand, the policy of allowing judges or magistrates 
to grant certificates has met with considerable objection. 
The examination of the documentary evidence is usually 
less thorough if papers are procured in this way. 
As the physical effects of premature child labor furnish 
one of the fundamental bases of child labor laws, no child 
should be given a working certificate unless his health and 
physical requirements are satisfactory. Unless he has the 
normal weight and stature of persons between fourteen 
and sixteen years of age, papers should be refused. The 
health department should be authorized to decide upon 
the physical fitness of all applicants for working papers. 
New York and Ohio follow this plan. In some cases this 
work can be done by the physicians of the board of educa- 
tion. In some states the child only requires a medical 
certificate. In others no physical tests are made. 
9. EpucationaL REQUIREMENTS. 
A compulsory education law is the best preventive of 
premature child labor, but the great majority of states 
i
-P-A-G-E-216
  210 CHILD PROBLEMS 
have not correlated their compulsory education and child 
labor laws. There are two types of educational require- 
ments affecting the working child: first, direct compulsory 
education within certain age limits. This requirement 
merely emphasizes the time spent in school, and after a 
child has passed the upper age limit, he may enter indus- 
try without further educational examination. Unfor- 
tunately a large number of states do not require a sufficient 
annual attendance to insure the child of working age a 
reasonable education. In order that dependent children 
may have a chance to support themselves some states 
excuse them from school attendance. 
A second type of educational requirement is a provision 
of law requiring all children before they enter industry 
to have acquired a certain amount of education. The 
state of Washington requires the child to have completed 
the eight years’ course of the elementary school, but lacks 
the machinery of enforcement. Other states require the 
completion of a specified course in which is included a 
knowledge of grammar, geography, and a certain advance 
in the elements of arithmetic. New York exemplifies 
this fype of legislation. It practically provides that the 
child shall have @®mpleted the fifth grade of the school 
curriculum. Another group of states simply provides that 
the child shall have attended school for a specified time 
before he may receive working papers, and a few require 
the child to attend school during the period of employment. 
In some cities children are expected to attend the night 
_ schools, but exemptions from this requirement are allowed 
in some instances. 
A knowledge of the English language is absolutely es- 
sential to every child. The educational requirement of 
working children should be not less than the completion 
of the standard sixth grade work. As our educational 
system becomes more rational, and a more satisfactory 
 
-P-A-G-E-217
  CHILD LABOR LEGISLATION 211 
adaptation to present conditions is secured, an eighth grade 
training should be required of all children. 
10. DancERous TRADES. 
A number of industries are relatively more dangerous 
than others, and from these in some states children are 
excluded by law. No child under sixteen years of age 
should be allowed to enter any occupation which is dan- 
gerous to the life, limb, health, or morals of such child. 
The moral and physiological plasticity of the child is a 
source of danger when exposure to bad conditions takes 
place, and certain trades should therefore be specifically 
‘forbidden to all persons below the age indicated. Among 
such trades are the following groups: first, occupations 
in which dangerous machinery is used, for the young boy 
or girl is much more liable to serious accident on account of 
the absence of caution and judgment. Second, occupations 
which require the use of poisonous acids, paints, colors, 
or injurious chemicals, such as white lead, phosphorus, 
and others. Third, occupations which place the safety 
and security of others in the hands of the worker, gor ex- 
ample, the operation of passenger eleyators, and equally 
important occupations connected with the mining industry. 
Fourth, occupations which are likely to affect the morals 
of the child. The liquor trade, occupations that’ occasion 
contact with houses of ill fame, and the manufacture of 
goods produced for immoral purposes, are included in this 
category. Fifth, occupations which are considered un- 
healthful. The ordinary blanket laws, which refer to all 
unhealthful occupations without specifying the parti¢ular 
occupation or industry, have no value whatsoever, and are 
not enforced. The physical welfare of children demands 
effective laws on this subject. Our legislation should 
therefore be patterned after the English law, which places 
power in the hands of the proper officials to determine
-P-A-G-E-218
212 CHILD PROBLEMS 
whether an occupation is dangerous or not. Furthermore, 
each state should provide one or more medical inspectors 
whose sole duty should be to ascertain whether certain 
industries are not inimical to the employment of children 
under sixteen years of age. Such industries should be 
added to the list from which children are excluded. 
11. Inpustrmms ExemprTep. 
Usually child labor laws have not been applied to certain 
industries, of which, owing to its peculiar conditions, agri- 
culture is the most conspicuous example. The reasons 
for its exemption are so valid that they need no further 
discussion. A most serious factor in industry is the prob- 
lem of perishable goods. These include various fruits 
and vegetables in preparation for preserving and canning, 
certain kinds of confectionery, fresh oysters, and other 
products of minor importance. The canning and preserv- 
ing industry, however, is the chief manufacturing indus- 
try which in many states is granted exemption from the 
provisions of the law. This is partly on account of the 
agricgtural connections, but largely because of the perish- 
able nature of the,products. The New York child labor 
law has, through the decision of the attorney-general of 
the state, been so modified as practically to exclude this 
industry from its operation. It was ruled that the law 
did not apply to the sheds where the preparatory work is 
largely done and where child labor is chiefly carried on. 
The result has been leniency in enforcement of law in those 
cases to which it does apply. English experience shows 
that insistence on the regulation of seasonal industries 
has resulted in a most remarkable degree of conformity 
to the limitations imposed. Many of the long hours and 
much of the night work were found unnecessary. 
In the United States the right to work unlimited hours 
in the canning and preserving industry has been abused, 
 
-P-A-G-E-219
  CHILD LABOR LEGISLATION 213 
and more stringent legislation is needed. Whatever be 
the regulations in regard to adult labor, child labor should 
at least be carefully restricted by law. A large group 
* of industries are seasonal in their nature, and the goods 
produced are commercially perishable if not subject to phys- 
ical deterioration. The exemption of one industry tends 
to open the way for the escape of others. Law, however, 
should attempt to render industry more stable; besides, 
the interests of the child must not be sacrificed. 
A large group of the states do not include retail stores 
among the industries in which child labor is prohibited. 
Tn the small towns this is hardly a problem, but in the large 
cities much exploitation of children is possible if restrain- 
ing laws do not exist. Many stores are open one or more 
evenings per week, and consequently children are forced to 
work long hours on certain days, especially on Saturdays. 
The states which do not include these establishments do 
not all insist on conformity to the laws throughout the 
year, but several of them allow overtime or late hours for 
a definite period shortly before Christmas. Four states 
make exemptions. for the Christmas season. The number 
of days on which the law is suspended varies from four to 
twenty. This is precisely the time of the year when chil- 
dren in mercantile establishments are subjected to the most 
exhausting work and are in special need of shorter hours. 
Many young girls collapse during this season, and conse- 
quently lose a portion of their working time. Under no 
conditions should the child labor law be suspended during 
the holiday season. The health of the child is more im- 
portant than the amount of holiday sales; furthermore 
early shopping should make long hours during the rush 
season unnecessary. 
With only a few exceptions the street trades have escaped 
legislation. The New York law applies to newsboys in 
larger cities only, chief among which are Buffalo and New
-P-A-G-E-220
214 CHILD PROBLEMS 
York City. Boys under ten are excluded, and all newsboys 
between the ages of ten and fourteen are required to secure 
a license, while girls under sixteen are entirely prohibited 
from selling papers. The state of Massachusetts author- 
izes the city officials to control the employment of chil- 
dren in the street trades. Boston has utilized this grant 
of power, and has taken steps to regulate the work of boot- 
blacks, newsboys, and other street venders. In Wiscon- 
sin a state law has recently subjected the street trades of 
Milwaukee to legal control, and in some cities an attempt 
to cope with the problem is being made through the pas- 
sage of municipal ordinances. In St. Louis, by a police 
order, girls under sixteen have been prohibited from selling 
newspapers. The messenger service, formerly exempted 
from regulation, is rapidly being included in child labor 
laws, and twelve states now protect the child from this 
occupation. The age limit most commonly established is 
fourteen years. 
12. ENFORCEMENT oF Law. 
In regard to the enforcement of child labor laws a wide 
diversity of method preyails. The principal agencies 
intrusted with this task are: departments of labor, bu- 
reaus of factory inspection, the police, and boards of health. 
In addition, truant and attendance officers sometimes aid 
in enforcing the law. In the more populous manufactur- 
ing states the departments of labor are usually composed 
of subdivisions, of which the bureau of factory inspection 
forms one branch. Sometimes the latter is made a sepa- 
rate department. In either case the enforcement of law 
rests with the factory inspection organization. New York 
is an example of the former type, and Illinois of the latter. 
Fourteen states have adopted the first plan and nine the 
second. The states in which manufacturing is a com- 
paratively unimportant industry have generally allowed 
 
-P-A-G-E-221
  CHILD LABOR LEGISLATION “215 
the labor department to enforce the law. In the industrial 
states the tendency toward divison of labor has operated 
to create a special department of factory inspection, but 
New York has returned to the former system. In Massa- 
chusetts the inspectors are under the direction of the 
District Police. A separate body of inspectors is, however, 
detailed by the department, and these resemble in quali- 
fications the inspectors of the other two systems. In each 
of the states mentioned a high degree of efficiency in the 
enforcement of law has been achieved. Maryland has a 
separate corps of child labor inspectors, but the plan has 
not proven entirely successful, and Pennsylvania, with a 
factory inspection department, has been notoriously negli- 
gent. Until recently, child labor in mercantile establish- 
ments in New York was controlled by the boards of health. 
The results were unsatisfactory, and the work of inspection 
has now been transferred to the department of labor. 
A few states empower the school officials to enforce the 
law against child labor, and in a considerable number of 
states truant officers are authorized to assist the other 
inspectors. These officials, however, aim primarily to 
compel school attendance rather than to prevent child 
labor. In several Southern states, especially those in which 
the child labor problem is a serious one, the provisions 
for law enforcement are extremely inadequate. In Ala- 
bama the inspector may prosecute violators of the law 
if ordered to do so by the governor! Georgia and the 
Carolinas have practically no law-enforcing machinery. 
Few, if any, of the states possess an adequate corps of 
inspectors. New York provides for sixty, while Illinois 
allows twenty-five. Medical inspectors, who are badly 
needed to secure good working conditions, are still a nov- 
elty, only two states making any provision for such offi- 
cials. New York has one medical inspector attached to 
the bureau of factory inspection, while Massachusetts has
-P-A-G-E-222
216 CHILD PROBLEMS 
engaged in some such inspection through the agency of its 
school system. 
Inadequate inspection is a striking weakness of our 
American child labor laws. With insufficient inspectors 
the law has been violated with impunity. Both the num- 
ber and the remuneration of our inspectors have been 
inadequate. Owing to lack of vigor and a sane social 
viewpoint the prosecutions of violators of the child labor 
laws have not been sufficient in many states to become 
an effective deterrent of subsequent violation. Inspectors 
have not been able to make sufficiently frequent visits 
to establishments employing children, but in some cases 
the neglect has been intentional. In one state recently, 
an establishment employing a large force of children had 
not been inspected for an entire year, although the firm 
was suspected of violating the law. 
Efficient inspection depends in part upon the good faith 
and ideals of ‘the chief factory inspector, and the energy 
with which violations of the law are prosecuted. Such 
prosecutions must become deterrent influences. In those 
states in which the cost to the employer of a violation of 
the law has been inconsiderable, efficient enforcement 
has been difficult or impossible. In some cases earnest 
codperation between the employer and the factory in- 
spectors for the enforcement of the law has been followed 
by the refusal to prosecute firms for the illegal employ- 
ment of children, on the promise that the violation would 
not be repeated. This method can be successful only when 
a real interest is evinced by the employer of child labor. 
Vigilance on the part of the inspectors, however, still 
remains a necessity, and individual inspectors can not be 
allowed to pass upon the wisdom or unwisdom of a law, 
or to enforce only that part which appeals to them as 
rational. The refusal to require obedience to law lies at 
the base of the failure in many sections to diminish the 
 
-P-A-G-E-223
      
CHILD LABOR LEGISLATION 2y a 
  ee 
amount of illegal child labor. Competent officials celeste = 
through civil service examination are badly needed, and 
the lack of these has been a severe handicap to real prog- 
ress. Such officials can not be procured unless an adequate 
salary is paid for their services and a professional career 
is opened to them. Good men can not afford to accept 
the poorly paid and uncertain positions. Factory in- 
spectors should be paid a fixed salary from the state treas- 
ury, and money should never be allowed to pass from fac- 
tory owner to inspector. At best, graft and bribery can 
only be avoided with great difficulty. 
In formulating child labor laws, legislators should be 
guided by the fundamental principles which are involved. 
The social interests demand that such a protection of chil- 
dren be assured as to guarantee to an oncoming generation 
a physical, mental, and moral capacity equal to the indus- 
trial and social progress which has meanwhile been made.

THE DELINQUENT CHILD

  CHAPTER I 
CAUSES AND NATURE OF JUVENILE DELINQUENCY 
1. DrvELopMENT OF THE JUVENILE DELINQUENT. 
The attitude of society toward the juvenile delinquent 
has undergone a fundamental change within a few decades. 
Part of this change is due to revulsion against the treat- 
ment formerly accorded to children, who were not fully 
responsible for the offenses which they committed. The 
court trial in Philadelphia of a little child of eight years 
was the beginning of the juvenile court movement in that 
city. A few years ago a boy of eleven in the state of Iowa 
was sentenced to imprisonment for life on the charge of 
murder! Hundreds of little children have been thrown 
into jail in company with vile adult criminals, and in Eng- 
land little children were formerly sentenced to death for 
offenses so petty that to-day they would hardly justify the 
mildest forms of probationary treatment. 
We now realize that the child can not be judged by the 
same standards with which we judge adults. Accordingly 
youthful offenders receive a separate classification and 
appropriate treatment. “Juvenile delinquency now gen- 
erally refers to the violation of state law or of city ordi- 
nances, by a person who is sixteen years of age or under? 
The age limits vary among the different states, and in 
Illinois and Indiana the limit for boys is seventeen and 
for girls is eighteen. Whatever age represents, for the 
221
-P-A-G-E-228
222 CHILD PROBLEMS 
great majority of offenders, the line separating full moral 
responsibility for offenses committed from a mere partial 
responsibility, should constitute the age limit of juvenile 
delinquency. 
The term “delinquent” has been slowly expanding in 
meaning so as to include not only deliberate acts which 
would be punishable if committed by adults, but also way- 
ward tendencies of a serious character. It is necessary 
to reach the embryo delinquent — the prospective crim- 
inal — and in many cases it is already too late when the 
boy is brought into a juvenile court. Accordingly we 
find laws such as the Colorado law, which includes under 
“delinquents,”’ persons sixteen years of age or under who 
are guilty of such offenses as the following: (violation of 
any law of the state or any city or village ordinance ; 
incorrigibility ; association with immoral persons; know- 
ingly visiting houses of ill repute, or gambling houses of 
any description; visiting saloons; wandering aimlessly 
about the streets at night or about railroad yards; the use 
of vile and obscene language; immoral conduct ; jump- 
ing on moving trains, ete. This law covers almost every 
species of conduct which is likely to result in law break- 
ing and criminality, and is therefore capable of exercising 
preventive control over the child. Development in the 
direction of greater elasticity in the definition of delin- 
quency represents the logical expansion of preventive 
measures. Although in some cases the legal meaning of 
delinquency is confined to direct violation of law, the 
more progressive states in the revision of their juvenile 
court laws or in the enactment of new laws are quite uni- 
versally following the pattern of law described above. 
Effective work depends upon the legal right to direct and 
control the prospective offender.

2. Morau CLASSIFICATION OF CHILDREN. . 
The juvenile court idea depends upon the recently 
developed consciousness that the child is less in need of ref- 
ormation than he is of the formation and fixation of char- 
acter. The teachings of recent psychology and ethics 
have forced the acceptance of the theory that conscience 
and character are developmental; therefore the problem 
of the child becomes one of construction, not of repression, 
and youthful misdeeds are recognized to be largely the 
result of the environmental influences which continually 
impress themselves upon the child. The development of 
the child divides itself into three quite distinct periods. 
The first eight years of life form one period. . Many chil- 
dren of this age, if not immoral, are at least unsocial, but 
their delinquency is almost wholly due to the neglect of 
their moral education by their parents, and they should 
be treated as neglected persons. The neglected delin- 
quent child at this age is hardly worse in his fundamental 
proclivities than the child who is merely neglected. Ac- 
cordingly different treatment is not necessary. Full 
cognizance of the underlying causes of the difficulty points 
merely to the gross neglect or moral depravity of the 
parents. The child is not fully responsible, so there is but 
little difference between the delinquent and the neglected 
child of this age. 
During the age period —nine to thirteen years — 
several characteristic traits of childhood appear. Many 
of the instinctive actions of earlier life have vanished, and 
the development of the mind enlarges the comparative 
mportance of reason. The child, however, has not yet 
learned to correlate cause and effect. He is still deficient 
in prudence and foresight and to a large degree unconscious 
of the lateral effects of his acts. He is self-centered, and 
loath to relinquish the sources of his enjoyment. His
-P-A-G-E-230
  224 CHILD PROBLEMS 
  morals are still in process of development, and the plas- 
ticity of this period makes him very susceptible to the 
external impressions which he receives. Not yet of a 
sufficiently reflective nature, his morals are largely the 
result of imitation or of teaching, accepted because of its 
seeming authority. The formation of habit proceeds at 
a rapid pace during this period. The moral habits are of 
special importance because they later ripen into the moral 
aberrations with which adolescence is characterized. The 
religious bias is, however, imparted during this period, 
and the child likewise tends to become more truthful. 
The conspicuous traits of this period are developing con- 
science, growing reason, formation of habit, and advance 
in foresight. 
The period of life including the years from twelve or 
thirteen to seventeen is marked by the practical com- 
pletion of habit formation, and trains the child for an as- 
cending or descending career. This period witnesses the 
culmination of fundamental physiological and psycholog- 
ical changes. The child arrives at puberty, and endures 
many physical and emotional disturbances. These years 
are therefore fraught with danger for boy and girl. It is 
significant that the religious impulse is strongest in this 
period, and that conversions are most numerous.’ Star- 
buck has well shown the age incidence of emotionalism 
both for boys and girls, and his observations suggest the 
importance of properly harnessing this psychic energy. 
The religious impulse has its counterpart in the wayward 
and criminal instincts of the boy, and these come to the 
surface during the same period. Accordingly a large 
number of boys manifest an incorrigibility which, unless 
properly directed, will lead to absolute criminality. Rapid 
growth and the failure of the child to understand himself 
also lead to moral aberrations which require the most care- 
1See The Psychology of Religion, Chapters III, XVI.

ful treatment. Sex differentiation in this period affects 
not only the direct mental equilibrium of the youth, but the 
attitude of the two sexes toward each other. The crys- 
tallization of habit and the permanent tendencies which are 
imparted thereby call emphatic attention to the problem 
of the child of this age period.’ 
8. Causes oF JUVENILE DELINQUENCY. 
a. Home Conditions. 
A fruitful cause of juvenile delinquency consists of the 
changing social conditions which make individual acts, 
harmless in themselves, a menace to society. The exu- 
berant spirits of the boy must find expression in activity 
and excitement, and suppression is not possible. The 
numerous contacts of the city require a limitation of in- 
dividual activity. Thoughtless acts which are entirely 
justifiable and even desirable in the country districts may 
be a constant danger to property in the city. Accordingly 
a series of city ordinances have been enacted which con- 
demn and prohibit such acts. Playing ball is not inher- 
ently a punishable offense, but to obstruct the streets or 
to endanger other persons who are using the street is 
distinctly anti-social, and is therefore prohibited by city 
ordinances. Persons may be injured, windows broken, 
and runaways caused by such sports conducted on the 
streets. The highly valued bonfire belongs to the same 
category. Few boys can restrain themselves at the sight 
of a fire, and an even greater thrill follows their participa- 
tion in a bonfire scene. The social needs of to-day there- 
fore interdict acts which boys have for centuries been 
allowed to do, and as the boy nature has not changed, 
many offenses are committed which the self-centered and 
1 This classification is a slight modification of that offered by Professor 
C. R. Henderson in his book, Dependents, Defectives, Delinquents.

thoughtless boy does without malice or deliberation. 
The Philadelphia girl of eight who set fire to a house did 
so to see the fire and the fire engines, not to commit arson. 
Home training, not laws, are needed in such cases. A 
change of law does not readily reconstruct a child’s nature. 
Parental incompetency is a prolific source of juvenile 
“delinquency, for the home environment is the most potent 
factor contributing to the formation of character and 
habit. The force of social heredity, comprising the ideals, 
morals, religious impulses, teaching, discipline, order, per- 
sonal habits, and superstitions of the parents, overpowers 
the child by its almost irresistible momentum! 
A recent development in the home, especially the native 
American home, is the too liberal abandonment of the dis- 
cipline and subordination of the child/* The brutal cor- 
poral punishment of old has given way in many cases to 
soft effeminate indulgence by parents of the idlest humors 
of their children. Thus selfish and imperious instincts 
develop at the expense of altruism and obedience, and 
parents are unable to develop appropriate moral and social 
traits in their children’ The latter dominate and subdue 
instead of being molded into moral shape by their parents. 
If children were mentally mature, they should be permitted 
to enjoy complete self-direction. But they are not, and 
unless subjected to the proper restrictions and discipline, 
they will fail to reach the full level of human moral attain- 
ment. Corporal punishment, although undesirable in the 
majority of cases, can not be totally abandoned either 
in the home or in the school, except at the cost of the moral 
development of a limited number of children. The grow- 
ing protest against its total abolition is not without sig- 
nificance. Is it not surprising that native-born children 
of native-born parents should form so large a percentage 
of the total delinquency in our large cities? We are not 
yet ready for exclusive control by moral suasion.
-P-A-G-E-233
     CAUSES OF JUVENILE DELINQUENCY 227 
of parents to recognize that the life of to-day requires 
different treatment of the child than did the conditions 
of their own youth. What may have been permissible 
then is anti-social now. The energy of the child must 
be allowed to express itself, but this does not authorize 
unbridled and ruthless methods which are a menace to life 
and property. The great majority of children expend their 
enthusiasm in harmless ways, and yet reap all the advan- 
tages which such excesses afford. Parental incapacity 
to adapt the needs of the child to those of the community 
results in an antiquated attitude on the part of the child, 
the frequent outcome of which is waywardness and crimi- 
nality. 
NNeglect is an important cause of delinquency. The+— 
relation of the character of home government to the amount 
of juvenile delinquency is remarkable evidence to this 
effect“ The statistics of one large city show that less than 
one half of the neglected and delinquent children had 
homes containing both father and mother. In the majority 
of cases one of the parents was dead or they had separated ; 
step-parents had intervened; desertions had occurred ; 
or the parents were both dead. The absence of natural 
home conditions is therefore an unmistakable cause of 
the vicious tendencies of the child. The control of the 
father seems more effectual than that of the mother. Fewer 
instances of delinquency are recorded for children who 
live with their father only, than for those who live with 
their mother.t The absence of either parent and the 
neglect of the child by both parents produce the volume 
of delinquency. “According to Drahms, 50 per cent of 
the population of our industrial schools are either orphans 
or the children of divorced parents. Of the 4838 juvenile 
male population in French reformatories in 1896, 4821, 
1 See Annual Report of Juvenile Court, Kansas City, 1908.   
   
   
-P-A-G-E-234
  228 CHILD PROBLEMS 
or 89.3 per cent, were illegitimate. Of the 1095 girls, 849, 
or 77.53 per cent, were illegitimate.”* Perhaps nothing 
demonstrates the importance of home influences more 
decisively than does the abnormal number of vicious 
children coming from defective homes. 
Neglect of the home is a frequent result of the duinking 
habit-or of the indolence and indifference of the father. 
These attributes are easily transmitted to the child, whose 
vagrant instincts need only the slightest encouragement. 
Parental begging and stealing leave intricate traces on the 
minds of children, and confirm them in a life of idleness and 
crime. The child caught in an environment of this sort 
and accustomed to wrong and debased standards can with 
difficulty recover from the coercion of social heredity. 
Bad example, owing to the imitative instincts and tend- 
encies of the child, contributes enormously to delinquency. 
Too often the parents are entirely indifferent»to the petty 
marauding expeditions of boys who steal junk, wood, and 
other articles, some of which are brought to the home 
and utilized by the parents. Direct encouragement is 
thus afforded toward the continuation of a life of crime. 
That dishonesty and petty larceny is a result of the 
failure of parents to provide their children with a reason- 
able amount of spending money is amply demonstrated. 
Boys engaged in the street trades usually enjoy small sums 
of money. This is spent often in improper ways. The 
difficulty of entering street life without money tempts 
the boy to steal and dispose of the goods. The first step 
taken, stealing becomes a habit, and can with difficulty 
be checked. Many boys who have entered some gainful 
occupation are compelled to bring home the entire wage and 
are denied the use of the smallest portion. Investigations 
have shown that a large percentage of boys do not report 
to their parents the increase in wages which they receive. 
1 Parsons, Philip A., Responsibility for Crime, p. 139.
-P-A-G-E-235
     
  229 
  CAUSES OF JUVENILE DELINQUENCY . 
The difference between the original and the later wage 
represents the boy’s spending money. Dishonest habits 
are thus ingrained in the moral fiber of the young boy; 
yet such habits are the natural result of the parents’ failure 
to allow him any spending money from his hard-earned 
wage. 
A most serious form of neglect often results from a second 
marriage and the introduction of a step-father or step- 
mother. It frequently follows that under the new ar- 
rangement estrangements occur, or cruelty is practiced 
and the child becomes delinquent. Such parents, instead 
of correcting the child, seem to revenge themselves upon 
him. This is also true of many foreign-born parents. 
Vicious whippings of the very young child harden him 
and prevent him from responding to the chastening effects 
of properly administered punishment. Instead of obedi- 
ence he develops defiance and incorrigibility. What seem 
to be original criminal tendencies of the child are often 
merely the results of cruelty. Such other forms of cruelty 
as neglect to provide and abuse drive the child into the 
street and into devious ways of living, and are therefore 
not without effect. 
b. Environment and Associations. 
The environment of the boy outside of the home and the 
character of his associates leave their definite prints upon 
his moral nature, and are a large factor in producing de- 
linquents. The child who must spend a considerable 
portion of his tirae upon the streets faces many tempta- 
tions. His parents have not sufficiently warned him 
against the pitfalls to be encountered, and the child, because 
of Yack of self-restraint, BPeodily succumbs to the influence 
s is not sufficiently    
  
-P-A-G-E-236
230 CHILD PROBLEMS 
the pickpocket develops and the petty thief. It is owing 
to his street associations that the boy’s actions degenerate 
into disorderly conduct, disturbance of the peace, and often 
into the ruthless and wanton destruction of property. 
The bad boy is ever present, and degrades his less resolute 
associates. The opportunities for legitimate sport are 
meager; hence a greater readiness to indulge in the for- 
bidden pleasures. The many fruitless attempts of pro- 
bation officers to reform boys placed on parole in their 
natural surroundings are an eloquent witness to the in- 
exorable influerfce of a bad environment. 
Among the specific causes of juvenile delinquency is 
the presence of numerous saloons. Newsboys, and other 
boys as well, frequent the saloon and form habits which 
inevitably lead to delinquency. Boys play policy, fre- 
quent poolrooms, and indulge in pernicious games until 
they become enslaved to the gambling habit. The 
meager outlet for the energies of the boy of the slums 
results in spontaneous boys’ clubs conducted in forbidden 
places and under most unwholesome conditions. Such 
clubs are the natural development of the organization of 
the street gang, and their work is equally wanton and 
mischievous. 
c. Criminal Tendencies. 
In spite of the theory that the child of the juvenile 
courts is in need of formation instead of reformation, it is 
plainly apparent that a considerable number of children 
have acquired criminal tendencies- To what extent these 
are due to natural and inherited traits and instincts and 
what importance shall be attached to the contagion_of an 
early vicious environment are still unsolved questions. 
Instances of moral perverts are sufficiently numerous) 
Persons are born with the innaje tendency to develop 
into full-fledged criminals. Bg ho have not suffered 
from the slightest suggestioy have degenerated >|         
     
-P-A-G-E-237
  CAUSES OF JUVENILE DELINQUENCY 231 
into thieves, thus indicating that their criminality was 
instinctive. It is probable, however, but scientifically 
undetermined, that the majority of children included in 
this class are indebted for their delinquency to the influence 
of parents and the vicious surroundings of their earliest 
youth. Many of these children are precocious, and form 
habits and tendencies sooner than is usual. It appears, 
therefore, that physical heredity is responsible for rela- 
tively few delinquents. 
This group of children may be classified as follows, 
beginning with the less serious and proceeding toward the 
more heinous offenders :/,the morally weak who easily 
yield to the temptation to do wrong and who have an 
apparent bias in this direction ;?the vagrant child who 
glories in remaining away from home at night and who 
delights in the joys of numerous escapades ;* the truant 
who disobeys his parents and habitually outwits the teacher 
and the attendance officer; and the’ incorrigible child who 
not only disobeys, but maliciously resists parental control. 
The first of these classes consists of children who are not 
confirmed in evil ways, but whose minds are open to sug- 
gestions of wrong and mischief. They possess a plastic 
moral nature, and are easily susceptible to pernicious ac- 
tivity of mind. The boys who willfully throw stones with 
injurious intent, who place stones on car tracks and attempt 
to derail cars, and who play other pranks of a serious 
nature — these boys will eventually be found in the juve- 
nile court. The vagrant, in many cases, has suffered from 
parental cruelty, and thus has developed not only a wander- 
ing spirit, but an ugly disposition as well. As he grows 
older his bohemian habits lead him in the wake of the 
professional tramp. The truant is of similar nature, but | 
impressed with a heavier stamp of evil. Boys who sleep 
in boxes and sheds and elsewhere away from home at night, 
who continually deceive their parents, and are led away
-P-A-G-E-238
232 CHILD PROBLEMS 
from their duties by the associations they have formed, 
rapidly become incorrigible. The street clubs demoralize 
boys with tremendous rapidity, and parents, on account 
of their unwise methods, implant in their children the seeds 
of criminality. Thus children at an early age have their 
criminal instincts so developed that reformation is neces- 
sary to restore them to a normal life. 
d. Street Trades. 
A prolific cause of juvenile delinquency is the influence 
of the street trades on the working boy. No other form 
of work has such demoralizing consequences. The vice, 
immorality, and delinquency of the newsboy and the mes- 
senger boy have already been discussed in a former chap- 
ter. These boys are brought into the juvenile court, and 
their misdemeanors are often so great that reformatory 
treatment is necessary for them. Accordingly they repre- 
sent a large proportion of the boys in the different insti- 
tutions. The demoralization produced by the street 
trades affects others than those engaged in such trades, but 
the latter are the chief sufferers ; therefore the importance 
of legislation which will shut off this source of infection. 
The causes of juvenile delinquency combine to operate 
upon the same child, hence few children are bad owing 
to a single cause. They have been the target of a com- 
plex of influences, —malnutrition, parental incompetency, 
home conditions, environmental associations, and criminal 
tendencies. | The influence of the environmental factors are 
the most powerful, and heredity is not believed to account 
for more than one fifth of the entire number of delinquents. 
4. Naturn or JUVENILE OFFENSES. 
Lack of uniformity of classification, among the different 
juvenile courts, of the offenses for which children are com- 
mitted to institutions or placed on probation, makes an 
accurate ranking of the various offenses impossible. The 
 
-P-A-G-E-239
RE Pe Ne ae ee er a a 
CAUSES OF JUVENILE DELINQUENCY 233 
character of offenses, however, does not differ widely from 
city to city, and children everywhere are prone to distrib- 
ute their delinquency — at least among the most impor- 
tant offenses — in substantially similar proportions. The 
following table shows the classification by offenses of 521 
boys and 45 girls placed on probation in the state of New 
York during the last quarter of 1907.

Among boys, truancy seems to rank first, and undoubt- 
edly incorrigibility contains a large amount of truancy 
also; larceny comes second, but if burglary be included 
as an allied offense, then offenses against property rank 
first in importance. Disorderly conduct also ranks rela- 
tively high. Among the girls, improper guardianship and 
exposure are foremost, but owing to the inclusion of many 
cases of neglect these statistics have but little value. Apart 
from this group of offenses truancy stands first, incorrigi- 
bility follows, while larceny ranks comparatively low. 
In the different cities the relations are very similar; lar- 
ceny, truancy, and incorrigibility being the chief offenses 
committed, and often their frequency follows the order 
given. New York City reports a large number of cases 
under the head of disorderly conduct. In the category

of offenses all manner of charges appear, from murder to

  CHAPTER II 
THE JUVENILE COURT 
1. Origin or THE CouRT. 
The first official juvenile court dates back to 1899, when 
the city of Chicago established its court, the act having 
been made possible by a law previously passed by the 
Illinois state legislature. The idea had, however, existed 
in the minds of many for several decades, and in Massa- 
chusetts steps in the direction of a similar procedure were 
taken as early as 1869. In that year this state granted 
children separate trials, at which it also required the state 
agent for children to be present. Delinquent children were 
also placed with private societies instead of being held in 
jails and prisons. The states which practiced the most 
advanced methods of child saving did not lead in the 
establishment of the juvenile court, their need being less; 
but, owing to reaction against heartless methods of pro- 
cedure, the states where little had been done adopted the 
new idea with enthusiasm. 
Several years of agitation preceded the successful at- 
tempt to secure a law for Illinois, but success here gave a 
remarkable impetus to the juvenile court movement every- 
where. The law was scattered broadcast and became 
a basis for laws elsewhere. In Denver a court was estab- 
lished prior to the meeting of the Colorado legislature 
which enacted a suitable juvenile court law; Philadelphia 
introduced its court in 1901. The Pennsylvania law, 
however, was declared unconstitutional, but a new law 
: 235
-P-A-G-E-242
236 CHILD PROBLEMS 
was passed in 1903, and the court was then permanently 
established. New York City followed in 1902, and the 
cities of Brooklyn and St. Louis in the succeeding year. 
The efficient Indianapolis court was organized in 1902. 
All of the large cities now either have separate courts for 
children, or the individual courts have devised methods 
of granting the children separate trials. A probation 
system has rapidly followed the organization of a juvenile 
court wherever the latter has taken root. 
The rapid rise of the juvenile court is a marked instance 
of the imitativeness of the American mind. Although 
the new psychology had already deeply permeated the 
minds of leaders in philanthropic work, still the movement 
made but little headway. In Chicago boys had been 
thrown into the police station ; in Denver, within six years 
before the inauguration of the juvenile court, about 2000 
boys had been temporarily placed in jail; in Indianapolis, 
Buffalo, and elsewhere the large number of children sub- 
jected to methods applicable to adults but unsuited to 
themselves caused a revolt which needed only the example 
of a new way of handling juvenile cases. Chicago was 
therefore quickly followed by the other cities. 
2. ORGANIZATION. 
( Jn the majority of cases the juvenile court merely con- 
sists of separate sessions of the circuit court and is not 
yet organized on an independent footing. It is an append- 
age of some other court and is served by one or more 
of the judges from that court. In Denver, Indianapolis, 
and Boston the court is separately organized and its judges 
confine their judicial work to the business of the juvenile 
court, but this differentiation has only recently taken place. 
The two former cities now elect judges for this position, 
the term of office in each case being four years. The 
establishment of children’s courts entirely separated from 
 
-P-A-G-E-243
  THE JUVENILE COURT 237 
other forms of administration of justice represents the 
logical development of the present movement. By a proper 
division of labor all children’s cases — neglected, depend- 
ent, and delinquent, — will be thrown into these courts 
and all other cases excluded. A more satisfactory and 
farsighted treatment of children will then follow. 
A present weakness of the juvenile court system is the 
method of rotation of judges as used in many cities. In- 
stead of election for a definite term, appointments for 
short periods are common. Chicago selects one of its 
circuit court judges for a term of one year. Fortunately 
it has continued the same judge for a number of years, and 
thus the city has given to the world two notable juvenile 
court judges. In Brooklyn the judge serves two months, 
and six different men occupy the bench during the year. 
The bad effects of this method are partly minimized by 
the long terms which the judges serve. The system of 
rotation tends to lessen the interest of the judge in the 
merits of the varying child problems, and does not allow 
sufficient specialization to meet the delicate problems 
which daily confront the judge. Therefore election for 
an extended term or continuous assignment over a series 
of years is necessary to insure satisfactory results. Until 
recently the act of presiding over children’s cases has been 
regarded as beneath the dignity of the judge, and therefore 
one that should be avoided; some of our well-known 
judges began as martyrs, but the subject has now been 
invested with greater dignity, and the aversion no longer 
exists. The growing consciousness that children offer 
the greatest of all problems accounts for this change of 
attitude. 
3. Courr Hmarines. 
Undue publicity of children’s cases was a problem before 
the founding of the juvenile court, and was one of the causes
-P-A-G-E-244
238 CHILD PROBLEMS 
of its origin. Newspapers in many instances had agreed 
to omit from their columns accounts of juvenile delin- 
quency because they might embarrass the youthful offender 
and accordingly promote crime. Separate hearings for 
children, some of them private, also preceded the court 
proper. Out of the exigencies of the situation has arisen 
the type of hearings now conducted in the juvenile courts. 
Officially the hearings are of two kinds, public and private. 
Most of the cities retain the public hearing, but their 
methods have been so developed that the public can gain 
but little through attendance at the trials. Few people 
seem to know when the children are on trial, and on ac- 
count of the informal method adopted those who do attend 
gain no advantage from their presence. The judge is 
usually seated at his bench, and the defendants, complain- 
ants, witnesses, officers, and others directly interested 
crowd about him in a dense mass. The oath may or may 
not be administered, and then the trial proceeds. The 
parties almost invariably speak in low tones; after a 
short trial the case is concluded and its disposition ordered. 
Persons in the audience learn little or nothing of the merits 
of the case, and the interest which is excited is so meager 
that few spectators consider it worth while to attend. 
What is nominally a public hearing consequently becomes 
one which is in practice largely private. Glimpses of the 
defendants and the usually bedraggled appearance of both 
children and adults’ afford the chief amusement possible, 
and this is‘insufficient to draw any considerable number 
of spectators. The chief advantage of the public hearing 
is in the opportunity it gives to philanthropic persons to 
ascertain whether the child secures proper and humane 
treatment. Abuse of the powers of the juvenile court 
is also impossible under such an arrangement. The repre- 
sentatives of children’s societies, of orphan homes, and 
persons directly interested in children, attend the hearings 
 
-P-A-G-E-245
  THE JUVENILE COURT 239 
in many cities, and satisfy themselves concerning the 
justice of the disposition of cases. 
Private hearings are in vogue in a number of cities, of 
which Boston is an example. According to this system 
spectators are not allowed, and no one is present except the 
parties directly participating in the trial and the necessary 
officials. The children are entirely saved from the con- 
fusion resulting from the presence of an audience. A 
child is usually embarrassed on meeting a person who 
attended his trial at the juvenile court, and the avoidance 
of this possibility makes his reclamation more probable. 
The recreant parents also suffer a similar humiliation. 
On the other hand, the secrecy of private hearings invites 
suspicion, and the public becomes dissatisfied. Star 
chamber methods are hinted at, for no one knows of the 
methods employed in dealing with the children. Although 
no harm has come from the use of this method, the public 
hearing enjoys an advantage because it allays suspicion 
and satisfies critics. It allows a probing of method, but 
secures virtual privacy by means of the court practices 
that have developed. The juvenile court is or should be 
one of original and unlimited jurisdiction. This enables the 
judge to deal adequately with the child. In exercising 
the parental functions of the state the delegated authority 
must have a free hand to govern the situation, otherwise 
the exercise of these rights will be nugatory. The juvenile 
delinquent is a difficult case; hence efficient methods 
must be authorized. Jury trial, although allowed almost 
without exception, is seldom employed by the court. The 
' case is usually canvassed by at least one probation officer 
before the judge, guided by the facts so gathered, makes 
disposition of the case. The judgment of trained officials 
is far superior to that of the jury which would be secured, 
and in theory the judge is regarded as the friend and pro- 
tector of the child. Accordingly the interests of the child 
 
-P-A-G-E-246
  240 CHILD PROBLEMS 
will not suffer. By retaining his control over the disposi- 
tion of the delinquent, the judge can facilitate effective 
reformation. Given a free hand, appropriate treatment 
can be prescribed and carried out. 
4. Disposition oF OFFENDERS. 
Juvenile offenders are subject to several forms of dis- 
position, including acquittal, dismissal, fines, supervision, 
probation, commitment to institutions, and the require- 
ment of restitution for property destroyed. Sentence 
is imposed upon the boy, not as a punishment for offenses 
committed, but as an aid toward the building up of his 
character. The juvenile court does not regard the child 
as a criminal, but as a plastic being capable of normal func- 
tioning and of complete restoration to the accepted moral 
plane of living. The decision of the judge therefore de- 
pends upon the character of the child rather than that of 
the offense. It is but a step in the constructive work of 
developing character. It follows then that the sentence 
imposed must embody the corrective principle best appli- 
cable to each particular child. The courts in the different 
cities consequently vary widely in their disposition of 
cases. 
A large number of cases are everywhere settled out of 
court. In some cities the character of the law allows 
complaints on flimsy and unwarranted charges. On in- 
vestigation many of these grievances are settled amicably 
without judicial intervention. A considerable percentage 
of the defendants are discharged or dismissed after hearing 
in court. In some cases even the guilty are discharged, 
especially in case of a first offense. A reprimand and warn- 
ing from the judge usually accompanies such a disposition 
of the case. A large proportion of the children in New 
York City were formerly paroled, no sentence having been 
imposed, and were not placed on probation. Commitments
-P-A-G-E-247
  ee ne 
THE JUVENILE COURT 241 
were also heavy, but with the development of the pro- 
bation system a small percentage of the cases are now 
placed under the care of probation officers. Several cities, 
such as Denver and Indianapolis, place from 70 to 75 per 
cent of their delinquent children on probation, and the 
courts send a very small number to institutions. Denver 
sends about 10 per cent, but this includes those who fail to 
reform if placed on probation, and who must therefore 
receive sterner treatment. The influence of local con- 
ditions, the presence of reformatories and parental schools, 
and the attitude of judges are sharply felt in the changing 
proportions between commitments and _ probationary 
cases. In Yonkers, New York, during the four years 
1903-1907, commitments fell from 53 to 18.1 per cent, 
while probation cases rose from none to 47.1 per cent. St. 
Louis during the five years 1903-1908 reduced its percent- 
age of original probation cases from 44.1 to 12.2 and in- 
creased its commitments from 30.6 to 34.5 per cent. In 
the latter city short institutional treatment finds much 
favor. The child after his release remains under the 
charge of the probation officers, thus swelling the actual 
number of children on probation. A number of cities 
place about one third of their cases on probation, and an 
approximately equal number in reformatory institutions, 
most of the remainder being directly discharged. More 
efficient probation tends on the whole to lessen the pro- 
portion committed, and to increase the percentage allowed 
their liberty but answerable to the probation and parole 
officers, 
5. QUALIFICATIONS OF THE JUVENILE CouRT JUDGE. 
The manner of his disposition of cases reflects the qual- 
ities of the judge, and these are important items in the 
solution of the difficult problems of the delinquent child. 
In many respects the children’s judge must possess qual- 
R
-P-A-G-E-248
PB 
  242 - CHILD PROBLEMS 
., ities which may be absent in his compatriots on another 
bench. He must possess the legal knowledge and judicial 
training with which every judge should be equipped, as 
the training can only enhance his efficiency. Other qual- 
ities are, however, more essential for successful work : 
first, the judge must have a definite knowledge of child 
psychology. He must be able to know and interpret the 
child, to see the limitations of the child’s horizon, and to 
understand the natural subjective effects of external in- 
fluences. To know the mind of the child is the first step 
toward his reformation. Behind the offense stands the 
offender. It is with him that the judge must deal, and 
must deal wisely. Children can not be handled in job lots, 
but as individual packages only. Successful work by 
the judge also depends upon his knowledge of. the socio- 
logical principles involved. The problem of juvenile 
delinquency is a social question, and its legal phases are 
only the vehicles utilized to transport the child to the right 
destination. The purpose and aim of the work must be 
distinctly understood. The social as well as the individual 
causes of delinquency, the handicaps of bad parentage, and 
the compulsion of environment are factors which every 
judge must consider in his disposition of cases. A thor- 
ough knowledge of the problems of practical sociology, 
especially of those relating to the life and conditions of 
the poor, is a necessary part of the equipment of every 
juvenile court judge. 
Another quality with which the judge must be specially 
endowed is a sympathetic temperament. The so-called 
judicial temperament is out of place in the children’s court, 
and if introduced will only multiplythe mass of sin and 
suffering which already exists. Although the functions 
of the judge and the probation officer must be separated 
(and in but few cases is it possible or advisable that the 
former perform any of the work assigned to the latter), 
2
-P-A-G-E-249
  THE JUVENILE COURT 243 
still the judge must actively plan for the full reclamation 
of the boy — a task which can not be effectively performed 
without human sympathy duly tempered with a measure 
of prudence. The proper attitude of the judge is summed & 
up in the following extracts from an address by Julian 
W. Mack, formerly judge of the Juvenile Court, Chicago :* 
“Unless the judge be really interested in philanthropy, 
you might as well give up the Juvenile Court; unless he 
realizes that the problem before him is totally different 
from the problem either in the civil or the criminal court, 
that the question which he has to determine is not — has 
the child done a certain thing and should a certain thing 
be done to the child because of the act — but it is purely 
and simply, what can we do to save and redeem this child ; 
he might as well abandon his position. But even though 
the judge have the proper conception of the function of 
the Juvenile Court, he must gain a thorough experience in 
order to be able to deal with the problem. It takes study, 
and thought, and patience, and above all, experience. . . .” 
The need of judges fitted to direct the lives of the vast num- 
bers of erring children coming under their control can not 
be too strongly emphasized. 
6. EvoLuTION oF THE JUVENILE CouRT. 
When first organized the juvenile court was merely re- 
garded as an institution dealing with juvenile offenders. 
Separate detention of children, separate trials, and pro- 
bationary oversight — these were the principal functions 
of the court. The system, however, could not long exist 
on the theory that no child is a criminal, without develop- 
ing preventive methods. The court therefore tends to 
become a constructive force in the community, and co- 
operates with other agencies to improve the moral and 
1 National Conference of Charities and Correction, 1906, p. 217. 
cs
-P-A-G-E-250
  244 CHILD PROBLEMS 
social environment of the child. The increasing coépera- 
tion with attendance officers, factory inspectors, school 
physicians, children’s societies, settlements, and churches 
is an evidence of this development. There is no theoretical 
reason why the juvenile court should be a branch of the 
criminal court, therefore the former can expand its func- 
tions so as to include the disposition of every variety of 
case involving children — delinquent, neglected, dependent, 
and cruelty cases. Dependent children are at present 
usually handled in the probate courts, but these cases 
could very properly be transferred to a children’s court. 
Some states have already taken steps in this direction. 
In the Denver court, for example, the children are classified 
as neglected, dependent, and delinquent. In other cities 
the classifications are usually limited to two, — delinquent 
and neglected, — and the number of neglected children is 
about one third that of the delinquent, but if dependents 
are included, the total number of children is more than 
doubled. By concentrating all children’s cases in a juve- 
nile court, the importance of the court is increased and a 
greater variety of problems present themselves. Action 
of this nature increases the dignity of the court, and the 
cases are decided with increased gravity. Judges recog- 
nize more clearly the importance of the work, are inclined 
to study the various child problems, and become ambitious 
to serve society through the children’s court.
-P-A-G-E-251
CHAPTER III 
THE PROBATION SYSTEM 
1. OricIn oF THE SysTEM. 
The probation system antedated the juvenile court 
by many years, Massachusetts having begun this method 
of dealing with the delinquent in 1869. With the rise of 
the juvenile court, however, the probation system sprang 
into greater prominence. It has been called the “key- 
stone” of the juvenile court, and with reason, because it 
alone makes the success of the court possible. The court 
itself is little more than the disposing agency directing 
what shall be done with the child, but the probation offi- 
cer is the arm of the law which deals with the child directly. 
These children are the wards of the state, and it is the pro- 
bation officer who makes the state’s guardianship effective. 
2. Extent or System. 
Although the juvenile court is only ten years old, thirty- 
four states have enacted probation laws and are using the 
new method of dealing with the youthful delinquent. All 
the states containing large cities are included among this 
number. In 1898 Rhode Island passed a law providing 
for the temporary supervision of delinquents ; the Illinois 
law was passed in 1899; and a number of states made 
provision for probation in 1903. Since then the system has 
been rapidly extended. The probation system is being 
gradually brought under state supervision. Already 
twelve states have adopted a partial or complete system 
245
-P-A-G-E-252
a ee eee 
246 CHILD PROBLEMS 
of such supervision. Rhode Island was again tae pioneer, 
and in 1899 placed the general direction of the work under 
the authority of the state board of charities. The board 
also appoints the officers and fixes their salaries. The 
small size of the state renders this function an easier one 
than would otherwise be the case. Other agencies under 
the control of which some states have placed the probation 
system are: State Board of Prison Commissioners, Prison 
Association, Board of Control, and State Probation Com- 
mission. Two states — Massachusetts and New York — 
have adopted the last method of control. State control 
in Colorado permits the rejection of local appointments 
to the position of probation officer. The state of Utah 
allows its commission to appoint and fix the salaries of 
both juvenile court judges and probation officers. Other 
states limit the functions of the state bodies to inquiry 
into the methods and results of probation work, to sug- 
gestions for its improvement, to the gathering of statistics, 
and to attempts to secure a unification of policy through- 
out the state. 
3. PROBATION OFFICERS AND THEIR DUTIES. 
The primary duties of the probation officer are well 
expressed in the Illinois statute: ‘It shall be the duty 
of the probation officer to make such investigation as may 
be required by the court; to be present in court in order 
to represent the interest of the child when the case is heard ; 
to furnish the court such information and assistance as 
the judge may require; and to take such charge of the 
child before and after trial as may be directed by the court.” 
In some cities a head probation officer is appointed who _ 
has charge of the other officers. In the larger cities spe- 
cialization of the work of the officers has advanced consider- _ 
ably. The different types of probation officials are the 
following : —  
-P-A-G-E-253
  THE PROBATION SYSTEM 247 
(1) Paid officers whose sole duty is that of investigation 
of cases to be brought into the court. 
(2) Paid officers confining their efforts to the super- 
vision of the paroled child. 
(3) Unpaid persons engaged in parole work. 
(4) Unpaid volunteer workers whose duties are limited 
to supervisory work. 
(5) The judge acting in the capacity of probation officer. 
a. Investigating Officials. 
The delinquent child may be summoned into court after 
complaint by some citizen or official — policeman or 
probation officer — or he may be brought on warrant. Be- 
fore the case of the child is settled by the court, a pre- 
liminary investigation is made by the probation officer, 
or in the large cities by the officers detailed for the work 
of investigating the cases of children charged with delin- 
quency. Such official attempts to present sufficiently 
complete information to enable the judge to dispose of the 
case without further evidence. In a well-developed pro- 
bation system the history of the child and of its parents, 
the home conditions, employment of child and of parents, 
education, habitual associations, nationality and nativity, 
religion, and other pertinent facts concerning the. child, 
are gathered, and these facilitate the correct disposition 
of the case. This information is secured in part from the 
child and his parents directly, but is supplemented and 
corroborated by neighbors and acquaintances. School 
records and employment records are also utilized when 
necessary. The chief probation officer gives his judg- 
ment upon the case, and the judge in most instances fol- 
lows the suggestions made. Unless he is skillful in his 
task, the investigating officer will fail to collect many 
of the most important facts about the child. A trained 
worker is most necessary for this work, and considerable 
skill is required to extort the truth from the unwilling
-P-A-G-E-254
  248 CHILD PROBLEMS 
subjects of investigation. As indicated, wherever: there 
is a large amount of work to be done, as in the large cities, 
there can be much subdivision of labor, and the work of the 
probation staff can be specialized. In this case some 
of the officials can hardly be regarded as probation officers. 
Greater economy and efficiency is gained if the duties of 
investigation and parole work are separated. If not bur- 
dened with parole work, the investigating officer can secure 
more adequate information and prepare each case for a 
more intelligent disposition. 
b. Parole Officers. 
The work of the judge is less important than that of 
the probation officers who carry out the parental functions 
of the court. The judge can only determine the method 
of disposition of the delinquent; the probation officer 
must endeavor to restore him to a normal moral status. 
The child when placed on probation presents a new prob- 
lem, and critical constructive work then commences. Pa- 
role officers must deal with two kinds of delinquents ; those 
who are released and simply placed under the care of some 
official, and the children who are conditionally released 
from some institution. *Two distinct classes of offenders 
are represented in these types, and the methods of super- 
vision must correspond. 
In the first place the parole officer usually brings the 
child to the detention house, although in many cases the 
police still continue to do so. If relieved of the task of 
making preliminary investigations, the parole officer must 
still be familiar with the facts that have been obtained 
in order to supervise the child efficiently. His duties then 
are largely confined to supervision. He almost invariably 
requires the child to report in person at regular intervals. 
These conferences cover the work and conduct of the child 
since the time of the last report, and outline the nature 
of his prospective activities. Written reports are also
-P-A-G-E-255
  THE PROBATION SYSTEM 249 
filed. These consist of reports made out by the delinquent 
himself, reports from the school which he attends, reports 
from parents or guardians and perhaps employers, and 
occasionally from others. The parole officer also files his 
own report of the conduct of the child. When a child 
remains in his old environment — and in the majority of 
cases the environment has been responsible for the delin- 
quency — the parole officer must be familiar with the 
influences that surround the delinquent. He must know 
what the child is doing, not from reports that have been 
fille@Pout and sent him, but from personal observation. 
Although not a spy nor detective, he must be familiar 
with the daily routine of the child’s life, and if he is an 
efficient friend of delinquent children, he will take such 
steps as will lessen the temptation to repeat offenses, and 
will strengthen children in their purpose to remain law- 
abiding. To supervise the activities of the child in order 
to prevent degeneration, to turn his attention to wholesome 
sports and amusements, to interest him in better com- 
panionship, to surround him with elevating influences, 
to discourage any proclivity toward truancy and disobedi- 
ence to parents; in short, to build up his character — 
these are some of the duties which the probation system 
imposes upon its officials. Success can be best obtained 
by securing the codperation of supplementary agencies 
which are able to work permanently for the reclamation 
of wayward children, by filling their lives with wholesome 
influences. Such agencies will continue to work for the 
good of delinquent children after they are released from 
the jurisdiction of the probation officer. 
c. Unpaid Officials. 
At the beginning of the juvenile court movement, the 
principles of probation were so misunderstood that in 
many cities parole or probation officers were designated 
by the court to serve without pay. The Pennsylvania
-P-A-G-E-256
  250 CHILD PROBLEMS 
law of 1903, for example, provided for the appointment 
by the court of one or more discreet persons of good char- 
acter to serve as probation officers during the pleasure 
of the court, said probation officers to receive no compen- 
sation from the public treasury ; and it further required 
that the probation officers make such investigations as 
the court might demand, that they be present in court 
when the case was heard, that they furnish the court such 
information and assistance as the court might require, and 
that they take such charge of the child before or after 
trial as the court might direct. Compulsory unpaidllser- 
vice has had a short-lived existence in the United States. 
Practically every state having probation laws has pro- 
vided public compensation for its probation officers, al- 
though in many cases very meager salaries are being paid. 
Social workers recognized almost immediately the 
necessity of granting compensation to the probation offi- 
cers in order to secure enough competent individuals for 
the work. The burden of providing salaries for the officials 
was sometimes borne by women’s clubs, sometimes by 
churches, and sometimes by settlements and other organi- 
zations interested in social betterment. It is needless 
to say that the compensation given under this system 
was far from adequate. This fact, together with the justice 
and propriety of salaries paid from the public treasury, 
hastened the advent of a system of public compensation. 
A serious objection to compulsory unpaid work consists 
in the difficulty of securing trained workers for this purpose. 
The trained worker is almost invariably a person who 
makes the work a means of gaining a livelihood and natu- 
rally endeavors to increase his efficiency so as to gain a 
reputation and command a higher salary. Those in- 
dividuals who have sufficient leisure to undertake these 
duties without requiring pay rarely possess the training 
and experience needed for successful work. Often they
-P-A-G-E-257
  THE PROBATION SYSTEM 251 
are unwilling to accept the inconveniences necessary to 
success. 
d. Volunteer Probation Officers. 
The relation of the volunteer worker to the court system 
is somewhat different from that of the appointed unpaid 
worker. The volunteer deliberately undertakes without 
compensation part of the work falling within the jurisdic- 
tion of the probation officials. He is expected to do faith- 
fully the work which is assigned to him. The volunteer 
system in charitable enterprise in the United States rests 
on @rather insecure basis; whereas in Germany under 
the Elberfeld system such honor attaches to unpaid work 
as to make the office a stepping-stone to a public career. 
Only an incentive of this kind can insure successful results 
-from unpaid work. In the United States as yet no such 
incentive has been developed. The volunteer, however, 
is not drafted into the service, but is appointed only after 
signifying his desire to assist in the work of the probation 
office. Therefore it might be supposed that only persons 
sincerely interested in the work would apply for appoint- 
ment. In actual practice volunteer work, which is most 
commonly carried on by women, is handicapped by the 
following disadvantages: — 
(1) Frequently the volunteer has only an ephemeral in- 
terest in probation work — an interest excited by a sudden 
contact with the fascinating features of the problem. After 
a few reverses in attempting to reform delinquent children, 
her ardor cools, and as she does not feel the responsibility 
borne by a paid official, her efficiency rapidly declines. 
(2) Volunteer work is often in danger of becoming fash- 
ionable. When such conditions obtain, it is less the spirit 
of service than the popularity of service which dominates 
the volunteer. 
(3) It can never be regarded as more than a mere avo- 
cation, and this can often be conveniently slighted, when 
 
-P-A-G-E-258
  252 CHILD PROBLEMS 
other interests, such as dinners, balls, ete., absorb the mind. 
The needs of the child are not made paramount, and there- 
fore do not receive sufficient attention. On account of 
her inexperience and lack of training, the volunteer is 
often an incompetent guide, and much harm may result. 
On the other hand, capable volunteers for probation 
work are frequently secured from the general body of 
social workers in any community. The principle of volun- 
teer service must be maintained, but whether such service 
shall be given in connection with the juvenile court or 
with some other form of philanthropic endeavor depends 
upon the comparative harmfulness of the results. Some 
temporary harm may be tolerated if the undoubted result 
would be the enlargement of the area of interest in social 
problems. Social progress depends upon a widened area 
of intelligent interest in the welfare of humanity. 
The most extensive experiment with volunteer proba- 
tion officers has been conducted in Indianapolis, where, 
since only two regular probation officers were at first avail- 
able, it was necessary to rely in part upon volunteer help.’ 
During the first year of the existence of the juvenile court in 
that city, nearly 190 men and women offered their services. 
About 80 of these were employed, and 240 children, or an 
average of three each, were assigned to them. A large 
percentage of the volunteers were men of affairs full of 
practical suggestions. The philanthropic organizations 
and societies also contributed some efficient workers. 
At first the system in Indianapolis met with considerable 
success, but at present it is somewhat disorganized. 
In many of the larger cities volunteers have been accepted 
and a number of cases assigned to each officer, but the 
practice is being discouraged in favor of a working corps

Re ‘p., Doc. No. 701, p. 153; also National Conference of Charities and 
Correction, 1904, p. 369. Article by Mrs. Helen Rogers.
-P-A-G-E-259
     THE PROBATION SYSTEM 253 
of paid officials only. The city of Buffalo, however, 
depends largely upon an efficient corps of volunteers for 
its probation work. In 1908 the court was assisted by 
72 such persons, the majority of whom were connected 
with educational, religious, or philanthropic work. It is 
to be hoped that through the gradual extension of volun- 
teer work the paid officials will be aided, but not displaced. 
e. The Judge as Probation Officer. 
In a few cases the judges partially assume the function 
of probation officer, and compel delinquent children to 
report to them as well as to other officials. The prin- 
cipal cities in which this system has found favor are Den- 
ver, Washington, and Salt Lake City. The success of 
this system depends largely upon the concurrence of two 
factors: a judge with a strong personal influence, and a 
city of small or medium size, such as the cities named above. 
The able judge of the Denver juvenile court originated 
the system, and nearly three hundred boys report to his 
court every other Saturday, and come into direct contact 
with the judge.1_ Common sense talks are given, and loy- 
alty to the court and to law is inspired in the boys. Fre- 
quent individual conferences with the boys are held, and 
their difficulties and problems made plain and plans of 
conduct worked out. The judge consequently becomes 
a friend and adviser instead of remaining a mere official 
executing the functions of his office. Two principal results 
have developed in Denver: first, loyalty to the judge and 
proper behavior in order to demonstrate this fact; second, 
the growth of a class of voluntary delinquents, that is, 
a class of boys who voluntarily confess to the court that 
they have been violating the law. Many of these boys 
desire to mend their ways, but find it difficult to do so with- 
out being placed under the jurisdiction of the court. In 
two years 150 such boys have come into the Denver court, 
1 Children’s Courts in the United States, pp. 34, 80, etc.   
  
-P-A-G-E-260
254 CHILD PROBLEMS 
and among them have been a number of serious offenders. 
Although several cities have adopted in part the method of 
the Denver court, the majority have delegated the work of 
probation entirely to their probation officers. Unless the 
judge understands children thoroughly and has the proper 
temperament, he can not inspire the delinquent boy with up- 
lifting motives. He loses his dignity and falls into contempt. 
4. QUALITIES OF PROBATION OFFICERS. 
Since probation officers are the most important adjunct 
of the juvenile court, their qualities will determine the suc- 
cess of the system. They must have a comprehensive 
understanding of child psychology and know how to deal 
with children ; they must have personal touch and know 
the secret byways to the child’s heart ; they must be able 
to influence their wards and rouse in them moral and 
noble ambitions; they must promote the development 
of the child’s moral qualities, since he is still in process of 
formation. This they can not do without an unlimited 
fund of patience. They must be sympathetic but not 
sentimental, and they require a quality of firmness which 
will give the child resolution. This is urgently needed, for 
the absence of parental firmness is responsible for much 
serious delinquency. The probation officer must have an 
outlook sufficiently broad to comprehend the needs and in- 
terests of the child and to make the most of them. Finally, 
he must be never-ceasing in his vigils, for the time allowed 
him to mold the child’s character is all too short. 
5. Propation Districts. 
Two different methods of assigning cases to’the proba- 
tion officers are in operation. According to one, the city 
is divided into districts, to each of which a different officer 
is assigned, who cares for all the cases in this district. The 
advantage of this plan lies in the fact that the territory 
 
-P-A-G-E-261
Ee et ee ee 
THE PROBATION SYSTEM 255 
to be covered by the official is so compact that he is able 
to become acquainted with the conditions and can therefore 
plan more successfully the program for each child. On 
the other hand, the acceptance of every variety of case 
prevents such specialization as would conduce to the most 
intelligent methods of treatment. The district plan may 
be somewhat modified by increasing the size of each dis- 
trict and placing two officers therein. One of these should 
be a woman having charge of delinquent girls and the 
smaller boys. Philadelphia and Chicago furnish examples 
of the district method. a 
According to the second method, each probation officer 
has charge of a special type of cases which may be scat- 
tered throughout the city. Colored children are cared 
for by a colored official; white girls by a white woman ; 
and cases of very serious delinquency by a man trained 
in the art of handling this type of boys. This plan, while 
it may enable the official to acquaint himself with the 
details of a case, does not allow bim to understand thor- 
oughly the community in which the delinquent resides. 
It likewise compels him to cover a large territory, and 
occasions a considerable loss of time. Furthermore it les- 
sens the opportunity of the probation officer to identify 
himself with a community in a positive and constructive 
manner. Its chief virtue lies in the advantage which 
specialization in types of delinquency affords. St. Louis 
and Brooklyn are the principal examples of this method 
of assigning probation cases. 
6. LenetH or PRoBATION. 
Courts occasionally grant a suspension of sentence 
without submitting the offender to probation, but ordi- 
narily juvenile delinquents are placed on probation for a 
limited time. The average length of probation as repre- 
sented by the practice in several leading cities is indicated

These figures! show considerable variety in the average 
length of probation, as well as uncertainty on the part of 
some of the courts as to the precise average which their 
statistics would yield. In Yonkers, New York, investiga- 
tion revealed an average length of probation of not more 
than three months. This was regarded as too short by 
the New York State Probation Commission, which recom- 
mended a minimum period of six months for practically all 
delinquent cases. It should be evident that if permanent 
cures are to be effected a reasonable length of time must be 
allowed to enable the probation officer to perfect a program 
of reform for each child under his control. An average of 
nine or ten months is none too long for this purpose. 
7. NuMBER oF Cases PER OFFICIAL. 
Volunteer officers do not usually care for more than two 
or three cases each, but regularly paid officials each handle 
a large number. The different cities vary widely in this 
respect, the number of probationers per official ranging 
from 50 to about 130. The number which can be con- 
veniently handled depends partly upon the character of 
1 Report of the Juvenile Court, St. Louis, 1908.

Se na,

the offenders and partly on the length of the probation 
period. Serious cases can not be given too much attention, 
and the care of 75 delinquents is sufficient work for the 
average probation officer. If this number is exceeded, 
unsatisfactory results are likely to follow. 
8. Resutts or PROBATION. 
The precise results of the new system of handling cases 
of:delinquent children can not be determined, as themethod 
has not been in operation a sufficient length of time. It 
will first be necessary to ascertain to what extent peni- 
tentiary convicts as well as vagrants, mendicants, and 
inefficient workingmen are recruited from the ranks of 
former juvenile delinquents. Some rough estimates of the 
results can, however, be made by noting the percentage 
of recurring and successful cases. Several large cities re- 
port about 30 per cent of the cases as having appeared two 
or more times, thus indicating either that the probation was 
insufficient or that the boy was incorrigible. Third ap- 
pearances in court, however, range only from one fourth 
to one half of the number of second offenses. This seems 
to show that additional probation and treatment is de- 
cidedly effective. The following table records the results 
of probation in about 470 cases in the state of New York :1

258 CHILD PROBLEMS 
The investigation conducted in the city of Yonkers 
showed that from two thirds to three fourths of the pro- 
bationers were benefited, that the system was especially 
successful in the prevention of truancy, and that com- 
mitments had been greatly reduced. It appears that pro- 
bation fails in less than 20 per cent of the cases, and that, 
as the foregoing table shows, more than four fifths of the 
delinquents are positively benefited thereby. During 
the first two years of the Denver court about 5.5 per cent 
of the probationers failed under the system. The first 
figures from Indianapolis showed about 10 per cent of 
unsuccessful cases. These statistics are somewhat mis- 
leading because they do not include the cases committed 
to institutions, to which the more flagrant offenders are 
usuallysent. Commonly, probation deals with the first and 
less callous offender rather than the serious lawbreaker. 
On the other hand, social workers report that children 
frequently boast of their juvenile court record. The best 
possible results can not be obtained so long as this is true. 
The effects of probation are profoundly modified by the 
existence of adequate supplementary agencies aiming 
to fill the life of the child with forms of activity which 
tend to develop his better nature. The success of proba- 
tion in the parts of Chicago supplied with small parks is 
an example. It is plain that the system has justified its 
present existence, but its future is uncertain. The test 
of probation is not the percentage of children that are 
reformed, but the superiority of the system over other pre- 
ventive and constructive agencies. The permanency 
of the probation system depends upon this superiority. 
9. EssmNTIALS oF A SuccessFUL PRoBATION SYSTEM. 
Among the requisites of a successful probation system 
are the following : — 
(1) Civil service examinations, and trained probation

officers, for purposes both of investigation and of super- 
vision. 
(2) Adequate salaries to retain a corps of good officials. 
(8) The care by a single probation officer of no more 
cases than will make possible personal relations, and the 
use of personal influence over the delinquents. 
(4) Coéperation with the other child-saving agencies of 
the community. 
(5) A period of probation of sufficient length to impress 
the child with law-abiding tendencies. 
(6) A diagnosis of the causes of delinquency so com- 
plete as to make possible an adequate program of pre- 
vention. 
(7) The utilization of all available preventive agencies, 
and the inauguration of beneficial environmental influences 
so as to diminish the need of a probation system. 
(8) A judge interested in probation and in full sympathy 
with probation officials.

  CHAPTER IV 
REFORMATORY INSTITUTIONS 
1. Evotution oF InstrruTioNAL TREATMENT. 
Adequate care of delinquent children can not be given 
without the aid of reformatory institutions of various 
kinds. At each stage of their adolescence children must 
be subjected to forms of treatment appropriate to their 
psychological and physiological needs. Probation may 
be best for one child; institutional care for another. The 
former, however, has limitations which can not at present 
be overcome, hence the reformatory is a necessary supple- 
ment. The age of the child determines the type of in- 
stitution best fitted to benefit him. 
The social attitude toward the proper function of an 
institution for delinquent children has undergone a very 
interesting change, and is reflected in the names given to 
such institutions. Originally they were named ‘Houses 
of Refuge” —a name which still clings to a number of 
reform schools throughout the country. The name is a 
relic of the day when the object of institutional care was 
less that of restoration to right living than that of 
providing a means of escape from temptations. Such 
an object is wholly foreign to the enlightened methods 
of to-day. The first House of Refuge in the United States 
was established in New York City in 1825. The Lyman 
School in Massachusetts, opened in 1848, was the first such 
institution placed under the exclusive control of the state.t

REFORMATORY INSTITUTIONS 261 
As long as venerable notions of human depravity and 
the full responsibility of children for their delinquencies 
prevailed, the modern view was quite impossible. The 
idea of reformation, however, took root, and soon ‘Reform 
School” became an appropriate name for these institutions. 
The method of reform was crude and unscientific because 
the essential elements of child nature were not understood. 
Reform meant the complete subjugation of the boy, which 
often resulted in the development of a malevolent spirit, 
owing to cruel treatment and to too frequent corporal pun- 
ishment. Repression by suppression instead of by develop- 
ment therefore marked the earlier attempts to care for 
delinquent children, and the Reform School is the legacy 
of this period of misguided effort. 
The growing recognition that children were largely 
untrained instead of criminal led to the idea of the train- 
ing school. Accordingly training was seized upon as the 
remedy for youthful criminality. The need of filling the 
mind of the boy with good wholesome thoughts and of 
preparing him for a useful career was recognized in the 
program of the institution. In assuming this position 
the men in charge of reformatories applied the correct 
principles. Experience has shown that the most success- 
ful reformation has been accomplished by means of trade 
training. Some of the institutions therefore assumed 
the name of “Industrial Schools,” thus recognizing not only 
the need of training but the character of training neces- 
sary to meet the demands of the present industrial world. 
That disinclination to attend school and dissatisfaction with 
the kind of instruction received in schools are important 
causes of delinquency is a noteworthy fact. That indus- 
trial training is far more agreeable to this class of persons 
than literary education is equally true. Accordingly the 
introduction of industrial training became the logical out- 
come of the attempt to use effective reformatory measures. 
 
-P-A-G-E-268

262 CHILD PROBLEMS 
The last step in the evolution of institutional treatment 
consists in the attempt to realize within the walls of an 
institution the advantages which a good home affords. 
No institution can rival our best homes in their possibilities 
of making good citizens: And the average home is better 
than most institutions. Accordingly the tried methods 
of millions of homes must be imitated as far as possible 
in the treatment of delinquents placed in Industrial Schools. 
In order to preserve or reproduce this home life the ‘‘Cot- 
tage System” was attempted. Although this system 
was begun in 1833 in Hamburg, Germany, it is not yet fully 
developed and does not properly supplement the industrial 
training which the institutional child now receives. _Illi- 
nois has recently named one of its training schools a 
“Home” thus recognizing more fully their complete ob- 
ject and purpose. They should be homelike as well as 
preparatory for industrial life. 
2. Present Functions oF INSTITUTIONS. 
Reformatory institutions are needed for several reasons : 
first, the incorrigible and dangerous child must be defi- 
nitely segregated from his erstwhile associates in order to 
prevent their contamination. Probation, even though it 
should prove ultimately successful with the incorrigible, 
would be too costly in view of the numbers who would be 
led astray meanwhile. Quarantine is necessary to pre- 
vent the outbreak of an epidemic. Second, many chil- 
dren can not be reformed outside of training schools, and 
such institutions furnish the only safeguard to society. 
The rigid discipline which the institution enforces cdn not 
be supplied elsewhere, and the habits which must be formed 
can only be acquired under close surveillance. Some 
judges hold that the first offender gains a very wholesome 
lesson if he is permitted to serve several months in the 
 
-P-A-G-E-269
ene Spee Ea oe es (an ee eng ee ee ee a ee ee 
REFORMATORY INSTITUTIONS 263 
training school. The majority of judges, however, do not 
commit the first offender except in the more flagrant cases. 
Third, commitment, or its prospect, has a deterring in- 
fluence, and the effectiveness of the probation system 
would be curtailed but for the dread alternative of the 
reformatory. Finally, children suffering from evil homes 
can be given a much better environment and more home- 
like surroundings in model institutions such as are arising 
at the present time. Probation is doomed to failure from 
the outset if bad boys are allowed to remain in some of the 
homes from which they come. A change of residence or 
the “placing out” of the boys is often impracticable or 
unwise, so the only remaining course is commitment to an 
institution. ; 
8. Types or INsTITUTIONS. 
a. Detention Homes. 
The Detention Home is a temporary shelter for the child 
about to be brought into the juvenile court. When the 
child is arrested he is taken to this home, or, in certain 
cases, allowed his liberty if reasonable assurances ure given 
that he will appear in court at the appointed time. The 
detention homes seldom provide for a large number of 
children. They take the place of the police stations as 
far as children are concerned, and children are held for only 
a few days at most. Separate accommodations are pro- 
vided for the two sexes, also playrooms, lounging rooms, 
etc. In the smaller cities, where juvenile court convenes 
but once throughout the week, a child may be detained 
for a period of six days, and toward the approach of court 
day the home is often filled with prospective delinquents. 
In the larger cities, where the court holds its sessions three 
or more times per week, the day of trial arrives sooner 
and the problem of the detention home is less acute. After 
 
-P-A-G-E-270
ee eS Ee Nene Pee 
264 CHILD PROBLEMS 
the conclusion of the trial the child is removed from the 
home and placed according to the disposition which has 
been made of the case. 
b. Parental or Truant Schools. 
Scarcely rising to the dignity and character of an in- 
stitution, yet necessary for the reclamation of the bad boy, 
is the parental school. The schools are of two types. The | 
one retains the child during school hours only, and is simply 
a special day school where manual training and handicraft 
are emphasized. Failure to attend these schools, when 
ordered to do so, incurs additional punishment, and sub- 
jects the child to the further discretion of the authorities. 
The system suffers somewhat from the disinclination of the 
children to work themselves out of the school. They are 
placed under favorable conditions, and many prefer to 
remain there, thus making true progress difficult. 
A second type of parental school maintains institutional 
features. The children are removed to the school, and 
are there maintained and given instruction. The two 
schools of New York City belong to this type. They 
supply food, clothing, bedding, medical care, and other 
services, to the inmates. Commitments are temporary 
only, and either a release or a transference to some other 
institution follows shortly. Private institutions in some 
instances perform the functions of the truant school, but 
these do not usually separate children committed for this 
reason from those who have come for other causes, and 
therefore often yield inferior results. The parental school 
is needed for the control of wayward, incorrigible, and 
truant children who can not be successfully governed by 
their parents and who defy the truant officers as well as 
the court officials. The school should be devoted to chil- 
dren whose delinquencies are not so serious as to require 
commitment to the reform school. However, children 
should not be sent unless they are ten or more years of
-P-A-G-E-271
ee Ee 
REFORMATORY INSTITUTIONS 265 
age. Younger children can usually be disposed of accord- 
ing to the family plan, or placing-out system. For the 
child of twelve years, rigorous discipline is often necessary, 
and this can be best provided by means of a short term 
at such a school. He will then be prepared for probation 
or for normal home life. At the parental school he is 
under watchful care, is boarded, is given instruction along 
both literary and industrial lines, and is measurably 
domesticated. The John Worthy School of Chicago is 
perhaps the most conspicuous school of this class. 
c. Training Schools, Industrial Schools, and Houses of 
Refuge. 
As already indicated, the institutions passing under the 
various names forming the topic of this paragraph all 
belong to the same type. At present their purpose, re- 
gardless of their name, is identical. They are reforma- 
tories to which the more serious cases of youthful delin- 
quency are sent. Violations of law which constitute 
penitentiary offenses if perpetrated by adults require 
the commitment of a child guilty of a similar offense to 
the training or industrial school. In many cases less 
heinous offenders are also sent to these institutions. All 
children under sixteen —the age period during which 
the juvenile court has jurisdiction — are subject to sen- 
tence to the reformatory. Control of the child may be 
maintained until his majority, although some of the com- 
mitments are for definite periods. 
These institutions should be connected with the edu- 
cational system of the city or state. In theory they are 
training schools dealing with a class of very difficult cases. 
The logical sequence of the theory demands that the school 
become an integral part of the educational work of the 
community. In the practical application of methods, a 
wide divergence from the normal may properly be allowed. 
The Industrial School of the city of St. Louis is controlled 
 
-P-A-G-E-272
' . 
266 CHILD PROBLEMS 
by a Board of Trustees, which, under a time contract, has 
granted to the Board of Education the charge of the school 
instruction of the children. Inmates of industrial schools 
should not be released until they give satisfactory evidence 
that their recommitment will not be necessary. | 
The various state reform schools do not differ func- 
tionally from the class of institutions just discussed. In 
order that the scattered delinquent children of the more 
sparsely settled districts may be accommodated, it is neces- 
sary for the state to make provision for their commitment. 
Many cities have established their own industrial schools, 
but state institutions are needed for the benefit of the 
smaller communities. Some of the state schools, how- 
ever, admit children up to the age of eighteen years. Cor- 
rect method requires that children over sixteen years of 
age be separated from those under that age. Where more 
extended age limits prevail, the probability of proper sepa- 
ration is somewhat remote. 
4. SEPARATION OF SEXES. 
The number of boys committed to public institutions for 
delinquent children is about four times that of girls. A 
prime essential of successful control consists in the sepa- 
ration of the sexes, either through the establishment of 
separate institutions or of separate departments in the 
same institution so conducted that no communication 
between them will be possible. Separate institutions entail 
a considerable duplication of equipment, but insure the 
necessary segregation of the sexes. The school for girls 
usually being smaller, some danger exists in regard to its 
efficiency. This difficulty is overcome when the two sexes 
form departments of the same institution. The problem 
of the delinquent girl is a most serious one, and therefore 
she needs special attention. Regardless of the specific 
offense for which they may have been committed, a very 
   
-P-A-G-E-273
     REFORMATORY INSTITUTIONS 267 
large percentage of these girls are immoral. Their restora- 
tion will tax the energies of the most capable superin- 
tendents. Separate and well-equipped schools yield the 
best results. 
5. Tae Corrace System. 
The value of the cottage system is in exact proportion 
to the needs of the delinquent children for the uplifting 
and steadying influences of family life. Certain virtues 
almost depend upon the home for their perpetuation ; for 
the development of these virtues, home life must be re- 
stored as far as possible. In the parental schools, to 
which the younger children are sent, the need of the cottage 
system is less apparent. The children are sent for stated 
periods of usually not more than six months, and the chief 
purpose to be accomplished is submission to authority 
and the enforcement of discipline. The training, indus- 
trial, and reform schools, however, should all be constructed 
on the cottage plan. The children in these schools need 
the definite impress of family life. This should form a 
most useful part of the moral discipline. The essential 
features of the cottage plan are these: separate buildings 
for each family of children ; families not exceeding forty in 
number (the best results, however, can not be achieved 
unless the size of the group is reduced to less than twenty 
persons); a preceptress for each cottage ; separate dining 
rooms, and a home life distinct from that of the other 
cottages. The personnel of each cottage should consist 
of varied but congenial individuals, so as to reproduce 
typical home conditions. The children of a family are not 
of like ages, neither should those of a cottage be. 
The progress of the cottage system has been considerably 
retarded by its great cost. The institution type of build- 
ing is so much cheaper that the cottage plan has been 
unfavorably received on account of the added expenditure.   
  
-P-A-G-E-274
268 CHILD PROBLEMS 
And where the system has been nominally adopted, the 
number of persons per cottage has usually ranged from 
about forty to sixty. The hoped-for individual contacts 
have therefore failed of realization. Institutions within the 
borders of a large city seldom hold a sufficient amount of 
land to attempt the plan at all. The greater the approxi- 
mation to the family ideal, the surer will be the hope of 
reformation. The modified cottage plan, on the other 
hand, is better than the old institutional type of building. 
With this system come pictures, decorations, and other 
forms of beautification, all of which serve to inspire and 
uplift the delinquent. The number of children in reform 
schools is not so large but that our public agencies can 
properly develop a fairly successful system based upon 
the cottage plan. 
6. PuysitcaL TRAINING. 
A very large percentage of delinquents are subnormal 
physically. In 1901 an investigation which was made 
of the children in the John Worthy School in Chicago 
revealed the fact that the average physique and strength 
of these children was considerably less than the normal. 
An undoubted effect upon their morals is caused by this 
deficiency, and their mentality is also somewhat affected. 
Complete reformation therefore usually depends upon 
two important requisites: sufficient good wholesome food 
and abundant physical exercise. Much of the success 
of Elmira Reformatory is due to the emphasis which is 
placed upon physical training. The experience of the 
,_ Philadelphia House of Refuge also corroborates this prin- 
ciple. After the body has been restored to normal con- 
ditions the child becomes more susceptible to the moral 
influences with which he is surrounded. Strength, desir- 
able mental attributes, and discipline are promoted by 
 
-P-A-G-E-275
Re a ae a ee eT ee 
REFORMATORY INSTITUTIONS 269 
exercise, gymnastics, and military drill. Every well- 
equipped school is provided with a gymnasium. For 
purposes of physical relaxation and moral stimulation the 
use of the gymnasium can not be too highly commended. 
Stress is laid upon this feature in the schools of each sex, 
and girls need the training as abundantly as do the boys. 
The training school is a moral hospital, and good physique 
conduces to good morals. 
7. INDUSTRIAL AND LiTeRARY TRAINING. 
Training schools should without exception be located 
in rural districts where an abundance of pure air can be 
freely secured and where ample room is not too costly. 
Furthermore, the schools should be provided with exten- 
sive farming facilities. Sufficient buildings can then be 
erected, farming can be successfully carried on, and ample 
instruction given in trade and industry. The precise value 
of the practice in farming depends upon the personnel of 
the inmates of the institution. If the children have been 
largely gathered from the rural districts, it is reasonably 
certain that a considerable proportion will return to the 
farm or small towns, and a better knowledge of farming 
methods will be a distinct gain. If the great majority 
of the boys are from the large cities with no knowledge 
of farming, nor inclined to study it, practice along this 
line must be regarded as discipline rather than as an at- 
tempt to prepare the child for his life work. The proba- 
bility of his migrating to the farm and becoming success- 
ful there is too remote to permit of serious consideration. 
The importance of the farm for purposes of industrial 
training has been over-emphasized, but its value for the 
promotion of good physique and right living can not be 
overestimated. 
In addition to farming and gardening, the schools aim
-P-A-G-E-276
270° CHILD PROBLEMS 
to give instruction in such trades as the following: car- 
pentering, painting, shoemaking, tailoring, sewing, baking, 
bricklaying, plastering, and printing. The girls are taught 
domestic science, sewing, millinery, ironing, and in some 
cases stenography and typewriting. In some institutions 
girls are specially prepared for household work, because 
this offers fewer temptations than many other forms of 
gainful employment. Very properly many institutions 
are almost entirely supplied by their own inmates with 
the necessary clothing, bedding, and agricultural produce ; 
buildings are repaired by their own labor; and the laun- 
dry, kitchen, and print shop are operated by the delin- 
quents. The training which the average inmate receives 
equips him for successful competition with other mem- 
bers of his trade when he is released from the school. In- 
dustrial training, by making a livelihood possible for 
every inmate, lessens the incentive to continue a career 
of lawlessness. Furthermore, the great majority of these 
children are interested quite exclusively in the manual arts 
to the disparagement of literary education. The boys 
enjoy the shop work, and forget their mischievous ten- 
dencies. Inadequate facilities for practice unfortunately 
handicap some of our institutions. 
The literary training provided is similar to such training 
elsewhere. Many of the children are woefully lacking 
in this respect, but every progressive school grants ample 
means for the child’s education, and in fact insists upon his 
literary development. Industrial training is usually given 
precedence, but the combination of the two is necessary 
in the outside world if the child is to hold his own. Music 
plays an important part in the life of an institution; es- 
pecially is this true of schools for boys. The band is not 
only an educative force, but a disciplinary power. It con- 
1 For an account of the industrial training accorded to boys, see An- 
nual Reports of the Philadelphia House of Refuge. 
 
-P-A-G-E-277
  REFORMATORY INSTITUTIONS 271 
duces to the moral elevation of the members of the school. 
Many of the children show considerable talent and in- 
clination in the direction of a musical education. 
8. DiscrPLine. 
Present methods of discipline differ widely from those 
in operation some years ago. The recognition of the facts 
that the children are not fully responsible for their mis- 
deeds, and that their minds and morals are still growing, 
serves to throw emphasis upon the positive upbuilding 
of the character of the inmates. To lead them to do right 
and to interest them in things worth while rather than to 
defy them to do wrong, represents the principle on which 
present discipline is based. A premium is placed upon the 
act of doing right, but, if necessary for the reformation of 
the child, punishment is not withheld. The curtailment of 
opportunities and privileges constitutes the form of pun- 
ishment enforced in many cases. Inmates come to value 
the slightest privilege, and the removal of such privileges 
is not only a hardship but a weighty deterrent influ- 
ence. The increased use of the indeterminate sentence 
grants the inmate the power of releasing himself from 
the institution whenever his conduct justifies his freedom. 
An institution should be as free as possible from prison 
features, even though an occasional boy should escape. 
Modern discipline rightly accommodates itself to this 
condition, and the gain of the inmates in self-respect is 
immeasurably greater. 
9. NumBer or DELINQUENTS IN INSTITUTIONS. 
No recent statistics on this subject are available, and the 
most complete account of the number of children in in- 
stitutions for delinquents is given in a special report of the 
United States Bureau of Census compiled in 1904.1. The 
1 Prisoners and Juvenile Delinquents in Institutions, 1904, Bureau 
of the Census.
-P-A-G-E-278
  272 CHILD PROBLEMS 
figures in this report are based upon statistics gathered 
from the institutions in 39 states and territories, the re- 
maining states not being provided with any. The majority 
of the institutions are public, but a number of private 
and denominational schools are included because several 
states intrust them with the care of a considerable num- 
ber of delinquents. The Catholic Protectory at West- 
chester, New York, which was included, contained at the 
time of the enumeration 2566 delinquents, or about one 
ninth of the total number reported for the entire United 
States. Ten institutions were reported from New York, 
and an equal number from Massachusetts, the majority 
from the latter state being truant schools. Unfortunately 
such parental schools as the John Worthy School of Chi-

The principal facts for the United States and for the 
most prominent states are given in the following table: —

The remaining states reported less than one thousand each, 
and in the South Central states both the juvenile court 
and reformatory are so little developed that no accurate 
estimate of the amount of delinquency can be made. It 
 
-P-A-G-E-279
  REFORMATORY INSTITUTIONS 273 
appears that 3162 of the total number of delinquents 
enumerated are colored. The aggregate number of juve- 
nile delinquents in institutions in the United States is un- 
doubtedly much larger at the present time, the juvenile 
court having received its greatest impetus since the com- 
pilation of this report. The total number of delinquents 
likewise is much larger than this institutional population, 
since the great majority of offenders are simply on pro- 
bation. 
10. Term or CommiTMENT. 
The child is sent to the institution because proper control 
can not be exercised over him in his native environment. 
The period of incarceration therefore should depend upon 
the length of time necessary to'so train the child that effec- 
tive control outside of the institution will be both possible 
and probable. The more youthful offenders, such as are 
sent to parental schools, usually require but a short period 
of institutional training; but the more hardened cases of 
the industrial school often stand in need of indeterminate 
commitment. Both the sentence and the method of dis- 
cipline must be adapted to the grade and character of the 
offenders. 
Present practice in regard to the length of the term of 
commitment is well illustrated by the record of the year 
1904. Out of 11,814 persons committed during that year, 
nearly 40 per cent were given an indeterminate sentence, 
and 41 per cent were committed for the period of their - 
minority. Adequate control of the delinquent is thereby 
assured. In several States, e.g. Illinois, Ohio, New York, 
and Pennsylvania, the indeterminate sentence is used in 
the majority of cases, while several states of the Middle 
West commit during minority only. In order to be fair 
to the delinquent, this form of commitment should, after 
a reasonable length of detention in the institution, be

modifiable to the extent of permitting parole during good 
behavior. 
11. Essentrats or Rerormatory INstITuTIONS. 
In a brief summary of the principles to be applied to the 
conduct of institutions for delinquent children we enu- 
merate the following :— 
(1) The adoption of the cottage system and the aboli- 
tion of the old congregate plan. 
(2) The location of the plant in some rural district. 
(8) The complete separation of delinquent children 
from other institutional children. 
(4) Separation of the sexes. 
(5) Emphasis upon training for self-maintenance. 
(6) Conditional release whenever the progress of the 
delinquént justifies such action. 
(7) A policy of upbuilding character.

CHAPTER V 
THE PREVENTION OF JUVENILE DELINQUENCY 
1. InvEsTIGATION oF CaUSES. 
Juvenile delinquency can not be prevented without a 
prior knowledge of its causes. In spite of efforts to as- 
certain these causes, no diagnosis has yet been made of a 
sufficient number of delinquent children to discover the 
exact truth. We do not know how much to attribute 
to one factor and how much to another. We do not know 
what proportion of delinquency is caused by bad heredity; - 
parental indifference, street associations, street trades, im- 
proper school training, etc. The best that has been accom- 
plished is little more than conjecture. The fundamental 
step, therefore, in preventive work is to discover the pro- 
portion of blame to be attributed to each cause of delin- 
quency. When this is determined, the application of 
remedies becomes more simple. 
Agencies are needed to undertake problems of this kind. 
The proposed Federal Children’s Bureau could render a 
signal service to preventive philanthropy by probing into 
the causes of delinquency and carrying on the investiga- 
tions with such detail as would establish beyond doubt 
the comparative importance of each of the principal con- 
tributing factors. Private philanthropy can conduct 
limited investigations of causes, and it is significant that 
several philanthropic agencies in Chicago are at present 
engaged in an extended investigation of this character. 
It is proposed to study the boy directly, to weigh the 
275
-P-A-G-E-282
ene 
276 CHILD PROBLEMS 
variety of influences brought to bear upon him, to deter- 
mine these influences, and to ascertain the antecedent 
conditions, hereditary and otherwise, which have predis- 
posed the child to delinquency. The advent of state 
probation commissions also increases the probability of 
adequate investigations of the fundamental factors of the 
problem. Meanwhile emphasis must be placed on those 
measures calculated to remove the present apparent causes 
of juvenile delinquency. 
2. Improvep Meruops or Lecat ContTro.. 
Improved methods of legal control of children should 
tend to lessen juvenile delinquency. The work of the pro- 
bation system should diminish the need of its existence. 
Much preventive work can be accomplished by a proper 
organization and codrdination of the philanthropic re- 
sources of a community. Better institutional treatment 
will reduce the number of second offenders, and compre- 
hensive adult delinquency laws will force parents to shoul- 
der the responsibility of wayward children. 
3. JUVENILE IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATIONS. 
Probably the first association formed for the purpose of 
preventing juvenile delinquency was organized in Denver 
in 1903. Its avowed object was the promotion of social 
betterment among the children. Formerly, delinquent 
boys had been sent from Denver to the Colorado beet- 
fields, but owing to the lack of supervision results were 
unfavorable. An association was therefore organized, 
and the children were divided into groups of twenty each. 
Each group was provided with a camping outfit and placed 
under the charge of a competent person. In this way 
much good has been accomplished and the impulse to crimi- 
nality partially redirected into normal channels. Sim- 
ilar associations have sprung up in a number of our larger
-P-A-G-E-283
Re ae an ee a es 
PREVENTION OF JUVENILE DELINQUENCY 277 
cities, and are now carrying on such a program of preven- 
tive work as seems to be adapted to the particular city. 
In one city such a club conducts the following varied enter- 
prises: a system of scholarships for young boys and girls, 
three dollars a week being paid to those receiving this form 
of aid; limited medical treatment for poor children ; 
two boys’ clubs; a home for incorrigible colored girls ; 
a summer camp lasting six weeks where more than three 
hundred boys and girls are accommodated yearly ; a hotel 
for boys, and another for girls. Nearly every one of these 
agencies has been instrumental in directing the over- 
flowing energies of the boy and girl into right channels. 
Preventive measures can not successfully curb the activities 
of the child, but they can substitute forms of activities 
which will lessen the propensities to wrong-doing and 
which will encourage enthusiasm for self-culture and in- 
dividual development. Juvenile improvement societies 
can do much to prevent law-breaking by promoting schemes 
of social betterment among children. 
4. Boys’ Ciuss. 
Boys’ clubs require time, thought, and energy, but they 
are one of the most useful methods of preventing boys 
from accomplishing mischief. The club operates to at- 
tract the boy from the street ; to give an honorable outlet 
to his surplus vitality ; and to socialize him as well as to in- 
sure the prevention of moral degeneracy. Boys will have 
clubs, whether under good auspices or no. In one large 
city a club was recently discovered holding its sessions 
in a small basement room. The equipment consisted of a 
set of dominoes and a pail of beer which was replenished 
nightly. Boys hold club meetings in the most incon- 
ceivable places, and frequently in the very shadow of vice 
and crime. The street gang tends to organize itself into 
a club, and if without proper leaders establishes itself in a 
 
-P-A-G-E-284
ne 
278 CHILD PROBLEMS 
degrading environment. It usually consists of boys of 
similar ages and differing but little in race and religion. 
Therefore it can easily furnish the raw material for suc- 
cessful organization. A gang usually develops a leader. 
The latter’s adherence to a project for the establishment 
of a well-ordered club is necessary to prevent its subsequent 
demoralization. The club should therefore endeavor to 
capture this type of boy. The homes of so many pro- 
spective delinquents are so disreputable and their parents 
so degraded and incompetent that the club must be intro- 
duced to give the boy an opportunity for wholesome leisure, 
for games, for sport, for reading, for literary training, for 
high-minded social intercourse, and for proper physical 
development. The club must provide advantages which 
the home, as existing in thousands of instances, can in 
no wise afford. It is a happy antidote for the squalor 
and wretchedness of these homes, and prevents boys from 
passing to the sinister environment of the street or to other 
questionable associations. The club movement is not only 
a hopeful preventive of juvenile delinquency, but promises 
to uplift home conditions themselves. Eventually the 
home may become so attractive that boys will be less 
anxious to seek amusements elsewhere. 
There are two principal types of boys’ clubs: the large 
one, which the boys join without the expectation of meeting 
weekly in an organized capacity, and the small club, limited 
to perhaps not more than twenty-five members, and which 
generally acts as a body. The former has in a number 
of instances achieved a marked success. Its chief pur- 
pose is recreation, and the boys may come and go when 
they please, their chief delights being games and gymnastic 
advantages. The Light Bearers’ Club of Kansas City 
organized in 1903 has a membership of five hundred boys, 
and the effects of its work are plainly distinguishable in the 
increased manly bearing and the greater refinement of
-P-A-G-E-285
  PREVENTION OF JUVENILE DELINQUENCY 279 
the club members. The Chicago Boys’ Club has had a 
most successful career. The enrolled membership for 
1908 was 1266, the total attendance 55,256. In addition 
to the usual variety of wholesome sports and amusements 
which it provided, it gave more than 6000 free meals, 
1734 lodgings, and 3091 free baths. Industrial training 
of various kinds was also provided for both boys and girls. 
The club has greatly reduced the business of the adjacent 
saloons — a fact which demonstrates its value as a moral 
and social agent. 
Progressive settlements also encourage the formation 
of clubs, some of which belong to the loosely organized 
variety, such as the Boys’ Club of Chicago Commons. In 
the majority of instances, however, settlements cultivate 
the smaller club conducted by a resident or volunteer 
worker. These clubs are normally organized on an age 
basis ; otherwise much disharmony prevails. The smaller 
boys usually indulge in games and _ sports, intellectual 
pursuits being quite completely excluded. Boys of four- 
teen or more can more profitably mingle debating, dra- 
matics, current topics, and varied literary programs, with 
amusement and social intercourse. The club leader 
should in all cases grant the club the greatest possible 
amount of autonomy. Patience, self-control, orderliness, 
and other desirable qualities are thereby developed. Re- 
sponsibility is increased by a policy of requiring initiation 
fees and regular dues, neither, of course, being prohibitive 
in amount. These clubs, although they do not reach 
so many individuals, are thoroughly effective in their 
restraint of juvenile excesses. No one realizes more 
deeply than does the club leader the spirit of potential 
good or evil residing in a group of boys between ten and 
fifteen years of age. If these boys can be properly guided 
at that time, the volume of juvenile delinquency will be 
greatly reduced.
-P-A-G-E-286
280 CHILD PROBLEMS 
The club movement in favor of the boy, and to some 
extent of the girl also, is now enlisting the support of many 
missions and churches, especially the institutional churches. 
These have formed and established clubs, have provided 
summer camps, and have arranged for outings on both 
land and water. The boys’ club offers an opportunity 
for our churches to increase greatly their capacity for 
doing good. It is to be earnestly hoped that their gradual 
awakening from their social lethargy will result in splendid 
development of their power to restrain evil inclinations 
in the child and to encourage the latent good. The new 
municipal civic centers conducted or projected by a num- 
ber of our progressive cities afford an additional foothold 
for the club movement and should become an important 
factor in the problem. Private agencies can do much to 
encourage club work, and the results will amply repay the 
investment. 
5. Parks AND PLAYGROUNDS. 
Playgrounds are a factor in reducing juvenile delin- 
quency. Play facilities which will draw the boy between 
the ages of twelve and sixteen — the years of greatest de- 
linquency — necessarily lessen the opportunity of s*°h 
boys to give vent to their surplus energies in unlaw 
ways. Wholesome sport soon becomes attractive art: 
employs the energies of the boys. The recency of the’ 
playground movement makes it impossible to judge of its 
exact moral effects, and the relative value of playgrounds 
for small children and those for larger boys has not been 
determined. To be successful the playground must at- 
tract the boy of juvenile court age — that is, from twelve 
to sixteen years. The small child may be influenced, but 
effects must be measured largely by objective standards ; 
hence the relations between the playground and juvenile 
delinquency furnish us with the best test of the moral 
 
-P-A-G-E-287
  PREVENTION OF JUVENILE DELINQUENCY 281 
values of the playground. In numerous cases teachers 
have reported that the bad boys in their charge have re- 
formed under the influence of some agent which has kept 
idle minds from contemplating mischief, or even crime. 
This agent may be play, exercise, the club, or work. 
The results of the work of the new recreation centers 
of Chicago indicate that the playground may directly 
decrease the prevalence of juvenile delinquency. Pro- 
fessor Allen T. Burns! has compared the delinquency 
of the area tributary to a recreation center with the 
delinquency of the same district before the centers were 
established. He has shown that two years after the open- 
ing of the small parks the delinquency of the South Side 
decreased 17 per cent, while that of the remainder of the 
city increased 11 per cent, thus indicating a net difference 
in favor of the former of 28 per cent. In four probation 
districts which are provided with almost adequate play- 
ground facilities, the decline in juvenile delinquency aver- 
aged 44 per cent, but the district having the most uniform 
population showed a decrease of 70 per cent. The play- 
grounds also affected the percentage of successful proba- 
tion cases — that is, cases of delinquency that were dis- 
ch -ged from the care of the officials. In the city at large 
{percentage was 39, but in the territory tributary to 
42 recreation centers 46 per cent of the cases were suc- 
, cessful. The general conclusions justify the belief that 
these small parks have been an influential factor in 
reducing the juvenile delinquency of the city. 
6. AMUSEMENTS. 
Children can not forego the pleasure that is derived from 
modern amusements. Our commercial agencies-are pro- 
viding cheap amusements, but it is important that the 
effects be uplifting instead of degrading. The five-cent 
1 Charities and Commons, October 3, 1908.
-P-A-G-E-288
  282 CHILD PROBLEMS 
show, which is so liberally patronized, needs careful censor- 
ship. The committee recently organized in New York City 
for the purpose of censoring moving picture shows has 
passed on about 80 per cent of the film subjects used in 
the United States. The standard of nickelodeons has 
therefore been raised, but until all films are properly cen- 
sored, vicious subjects will continue to be presented and 
boys and girls be degraded thereby. Standards likewise 
must be slowly raised, and many films which are at present 
tolerated must eventually be excluded. Local censorship 
in the large cities is also necessary. 
Many of the scenes presented in such shows, especially 
the more dramatic exhibitions, such as robberies, burglaries, 
and thrilling episodes, although they do not directly teach 
vice and crime, so inflame the imagination of the child 
that he often instinctively purposes to reénact similar 
scenes. The great majority of juvenile delinquents fre- 
quent the five-cent show and the cheap theater. Al- 
though causal connections can be established only in a 
limited number of cases, there can be no doubt that many 
children are demoralized in this way. 
The moving picture show can be made a wholesome 
amusement for children. Philanthropic and municipal 
activity should provide high-class amusements consisting 
of moving pictures and lantern slide exhibitions. The 
recreational need of the child can thus be partially met 4° 
and elevating forces be granted an opportunity to exert 
an unconscious influence over the boy and girl. The in- 
creased use by our public schools of appropriate pictures 
and scenes in the study of history, geography, literature, 
and other subjects will also serve as a wholesome substi- 
tute for inferior commercial recreations. 
The penny arcade, the cheap dance hall, and the pool 
room supply additional forms of amusements. The views 
which the curious boy sees for one cent are often sugges-
-P-A-G-E-289
I OO 
PREVENTION OF JUVENILE DELINQUENCY 283 
tive of, and conducive to, immorality. The cheap dance 
hall is especially disastrous to the young girl, whose inno- 
cence often presages her downfall. A strict control of 
such questionable amusements should be exercised. When- 
ever possible, private, philanthropic or municipal activity 
should provide a substitute. This can be done by the use 
of assembly halls in settlements and civic centers for dances 
conducted in orderly ways. The pool rooms, likewise, 
must be dissociated from demoralizing environmental in- 
fluences. The city, settlements, churches, societies, schools, 
and clubs must furnish adequate amusements and drive 
vicious pool rooms out of existence. The problem of 
providing amusement for children, and for older boys and 
girls, is one that can not receive too much attention. Amuse- 
ment will be sought, and healthy social conditions depend 
to a very large degree upon the character of the amuse- 
ments provided. 
7. ContTriBuToRY Detinqurency Laws. 
An important method of lessening juvenile delinquency 
is the enactment of adult or contributory delinquency 
laws. Colorado enjoys the credit of having passed the 
first law of this character. The purpose of this legisla- 
tion is to force the responsibility of caring for the child 
upon the rightful authority — the parent. The interests 
of the child must be safeguarded, but if possible they should 
be advanced through the agency of the parents rather 
than through that of the state. If a child becomes a de- 
linquent and the parent has aided or encouraged such de- 
linquency, both should come within reach of the law. If 
boys steal coal from the railroad yards, and their parents, 
without compunction of conscience, use the coal for fuel, 
both parents and children should be held responsible. 
Contributory delinquency laws contain three principal 
provisions: first, a parent, guardian, or other person
-P-A-G-E-290
ee 
284 CHILD PROBLEMS 
having the custody of a child, who encourages, aids, and 
contributes to the dependency of such child is guilty of 
a misdemeanor; second, the guilty person is subject to 
fine or imprisonment or both. Fines range from purely 
nominal sums to $1000, and imprisonment may be allowed 
in the county jail for a term not exceeding one year. Third, 
the judge may suspend the sentence, provided the guilty 
party complies with the conditions imposed upon him by 
the court. Some courts have given these laws real vital- 
ity by compelling the misdemeanant to pay a small part 
of the fine imposed on him or to spend several days in jail 
as a reminder of his duties. The remainder of the sentence 
has then been suspended. Thereafter the guilty party 
has seldom neglected to discourage delinquency among 
his wards. An obstacle to the success and widespread 
influence of such a law is the difficulty encountered in 
fastening responsibility on the parent or guardian. It is 
not purposeful neglect, but ignorance and even helplessness, 
that frequently accounts for the appearance of complicity. 
Contributory delinquency laws have been enacted in 
twenty-four states! The provisions of the different laws 
are quite similar, but they do not in all cases apply to the 
entire state, but frequently to the larger cities only. 
An additional method of enforcing parental responsi- 
bility consists of compelling the persons legally responsible 
for the child to pay part or all of the cost of maintaining 
the latter in an industrial or training school. Such a pro- 
vision of the law should not be mandatory, but its applica- 
tion left to the discretion of the court. If parents have 
been deliberately neglectful, charges for maintenance 
1 The states which have enacted some form of adult delinquency law 
applying to either the whole or part of said state are the following: Colo- 
rado, Connecticut, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, 
Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New 
Jersey, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Texas, 
Utah, Washington, Wisconsin, also the District of Columbia. 
 
-P-A-G-E-291
ie a a a a a hy) 
PREVENTION OF JUVENILE DELINQUENCY 285 
may be justifiably required of them, but if they have 
exhausted their resources in training their children, such 
additional costs will tend to make them harsh and brutal 
in their treatment of the children. It is generally con- 
ceded that parents should be compelled to pay the main- 
tenance cost of children sent to parental schools. Free 
eare of children in such institutions sometimes enables 
parents to shirk the responsibility of training difficult boys, 
the parents themselves being foremost in their efforts to 
have the children committed. Typical cases have been 
reported from Philadelphia, where a number of parents, 
who were unwilling to pay for the temporary placing of 
their children in foster homes, succeeded in having them 
sent to the house of refuge. Some of the Brooklyn judges 
have found it expedient to place parents under an order 
to contribute a weekly sum for the support of their children 
in the truant school. For this reason many Italian parents 
have become enthusiastic over the educational facilities 
of the New World! If delinquency becomes costly, par- 
ents develop greater responsibility. 
8. SocIALIzATION OF THE PuBLICc ScHOOL. 
As in the case of churches, which stand idle most of the 
time, our public school property can be more extensively 
used. If this were done, another preventive of juvenile 
delinquency would be brought into operation. The school 
playground should be open after school hours and on Sat- 
urdays. Supervision would be necessary, but the results 
would justify the measure. Many schools already allow 
this departure. Very wisely, shower baths, a gymnasium 
equipment accessible in the evening, and club facilities 
have been introduced in some of our public schools. The 
schools supply such elegant housing conditions that their 
more extended use for the refreshment, amusement, and 
physical advantage of the child is not only proper, but
-P-A-G-E-292
a a ee Pe 
286 CHILD PROBLEMS 
neglect to make such provision is distinctly blameworthy 
and economically wasteful. The use of the school for the 
holding of club meetings is especially desirable. 
9. CompuLsory ScHooL ATTENDANCE AND PREVENTION 
or TRUANCY. 
The school child is in the habit-forming age. The habit 
of truancy leads to incorrigibility and criminality. Tru- 
ancy is itself a violation of law and an evasion of parental 
desire. A large percentage of delinquency consists of 
truancy, and the most serious aspect of the problem is the 
effect of truancy upon the child. He habituates himself 
to lawbreaking and suffers from the loss of his school work. 
Where the street trades are open to the unwilling learner, 
truancy is frequent, the boy delighting in the exciting but 
demoralizing life of the street. He sells papers not only 
before and after school, but whenever his truant inclina- 
tions gain control. The street trader is the most skillful 
as well as the most troublesome truant. 
The prevention of truancy depends upon four main 
considerations: first, a compulsory education law apply- 
ing to all schools of an elementary character, whether 
public, parochial, or private, and truant officers empowered 
to compel attendance of all children at one of these schools. 
Second, an adequate and able corps of officers to enforce 
the laws. Greater New York, for example, maintains 
83 truant officers, who in 1908 discovered 11,865 cases of « 
truancy. Third, legal provision for the punishment of 
parents who connive at the truancy of their children. 
Such provision is of course useless without adequate enforce- 
ment. So far’little has been done to punish indifferent 
parents, but parental responsibility can no longer be neg- 
lected. Fourth, truant schools. These act both as a 
means of reclaiming truants and incorrigibles and as a 
preventive of more widespread delinquency. The latter
-P-A-G-E-293
  PREVENTION OF JUVENILE DELINQUENCY 287 
result depends largely upon the segregation of the delin- 
quent from the normal children. 
The causes of truancy must likewise receive attention ; 
otherwise the efforts of the attendance officers will avail 
but little. Among the principal causes are the follow- 
inp A 
1. Parental indifference, especially that of certain na- 
tionalities, notably the Italians and Poles. Very few 
Jewish parents fail to educate their children. 
2. The lure of the street trades and the meager earnings 
which are afforded the boy who would otherwise be pen- 
niless. 
3. The unsatisfactory nature of the elementary school 
curriculum. Many boys feel no interest in the work ex- 
pected of them, do not realize its ultimate value, and con- 
sider their time wasted. Failure of the schools to equip 
them for industrial pursuits partly accounts for this atti- 
tude. 
4. Unfair treatment by their teachers of children re- 
turned to school after a period of truancy. These chil- 
dren need encouragement and should be attracted to school 
instead of being repelled, as is often the case. 
5. The dissatisfaction of backward children with their 
slow progress in the schools. The over-aged boy becomes 
especially anxious to leave school and easily develops 
truant habits. The removal of these causes as well as the 
enforcement of the legal provisions above indicated are 
necessary for the abolition of truancy. If school attend- 
ance can be enforced, good habits are formed, and the 
opportunity for the development of the baser instincts 
is not lessened. 
10. VocationaL TRAINING. 
It is well known that boys have committed serious 
offenses and remained apparently unrepentant in order 
 
-P-A-G-E-294
  288 CHILD PROBLEMS 
to be sent to a reformatory where they might learn one of 
the trades being taught there. Although few offenses 
are committed for this purpose, the sum total of delin- 
quency would be lessened if the opportunity for learning 
a trade were given to all boys. The great majority of men 
in our states’ prisons are unskilled laborers, without knowl- 
edge of any particular trade. It is desirable that children 
before they reach the sixteenth year of age be taught the 
fundamentals of some trade. Our young boys, instead of 
stirring up mischief or engaging aimlessly in some tem- 
porary occupation, can then equip themselves for life. 
More manual training in the upper grades of the elemen- 
tary schools also serves to keep the hands busy both within 
and without the schools, and is an active deterrent of de- 
linquency. The attempt to acquire skill is captivating 
and is a wholesome activity because it trains not only the 
hand and the eye, but the moral nature as well. 
11. Prourprtion or THE StrEET TRADES, AND OTHER 
Measures oF CuHILtp Protection. 
The newsboy standing or lounging about the saloon, 
hopping on and off cars, plying his trade at all hours of the 
day and night, is full and fair on the road to criminality. 
Acquainted with the worst sections of the city, bohemian 
in his habits, taught in the games and vices of the streets, 
and frequently away from home the entire night, his moral 
nature necessarily becomes warped and defective. The 
night work of the messenger boy and the strange sights 
and sounds which he encounters leave consequences no less 
demoralizing. The large percentage of newsboys and 
messenger boys in our juvenile reformatories should be 
sufficient warning that juvenile delinquency can not be 
abolished unless child labor in the street trades is also 
prohibited. The news girl, although less frequently 
found, is open to the same influences and soon loses her
-P-A-G-E-295
ee Efe Te eT 
PREVENTION OF JUVENILE DELINQUENCY 289 
native modesty by becoming familiar with the men who 
patronize her as well as with the men of the streets. 
The right to employ children on the stage should be care- 
fully regulated and prohibited within certain limits. Fur- 
thermore, children suffering from cruelty or neglect must 
be cared for, otherwise the reaction from their treatment 
will arouse their antisocial tendencies and send them to 
the court as delinquents. 
2. Epucation oF PaRENnTs. 
Parents are invested by society with the duty of caring 
for their children, but they receive little previous training 
for this most important and delicate task. The advent 
of domestic science and of household economy is now 
affording our girls a little training for home life, but does 
not yet touch that most vital point — the proper care of 
children. When this feature is introduced, the small child 
will be the gainer. Our boys receive no training of this 
kind whatsoever. It is plain from the evidence of our 
juvenile courts that a large number of fathers are utterly 
ignorant of the proper methods of training children. These 
parents need advice and instruction. They need to know 
the elements of American citizenship, the requisites of 
ordinary law, the dangers of the city, and its temptations for 
their children. They require a better knowledge of child 
nature and of correct methods of discipline. The solution 
of the problem is difficult, however. We can educate 
children for the next generation, but can do little for the 
parents of this generation. Still the settlements, churches, 
missions, and other organizations among the poor can, 
through mothers’ meetings, men’s clubs, and individual 
instruction, accomplish something. Probation and truant 
officers can also influence parents as effectually as any 
other agency, and their efforts should be utilized in this 
direction. ‘aD i”

290 CHILD PROBLEMS 
Although not a complete list, the measures urged above 
are the most important ones and can readily be subjected 
to practical application. The problem of the prevention 
of juvenile delinquency is one that covers the entire range 
of constructive philanthropy. The measures of reform 
which will solve this problem will also solve many others 
and will go far toward the establishment of healthful social 
relations.

CHAPTER I 
THE DEPENDENT AND NEGLECTED CHILD 
1. Tae Importance or THE Home. 
The right of the child to life, health, play, freedom 
from work, opportunity, and a chance for moral develop- 
ment has been covered in the preceding chapters. That 
society must secure to children these rights is a principle 
of the present philanthropic propaganda. The nature 
of the task, however, differs for each variety of need. In 
all cases the children are wards of the state, which may in- 
terfere with private arrangements when the rights of the 
child are flagrantly violated. In the majority of cases 
the state merely assumes the position of overseer or super- 
visor and allows parent to carry on the work of properly 
providing for their children. Wherever possible, the re- 
sponsibility of the parents is enforced and the interference 
of the state limited to the insistence that parents perform 
their social obligations. This work by parents must be 
done within the home. The home is an institution funda- 
mental to our civilization. Its preservation must be rigidly 
guarded, and the duties taken from the home must not 
be so numerous as to lessen the cohesive force of this civ- 
ilizing power. In fact, the state is using the home as one 
of its means of achieving further progress. Consequently 
any action which interferes with the sanctity and do- 
minion of a home must be wisely planned and must not 
weaken the integrity of the institution. The breaking 
up of a home is a serious act and justifiable only under 
293  
-P-A-G-E-300
ee 
294 CHILD PROBLEMS 
exceptional conditions. Nevertheless, the rights of society 
are paramount, and if its interests will be plainly served 
by such action, then the step is right and expedient. 
“\The problem of the dependent and neglected child often 
becomes the question of the re-formation of family and 
home ties. The state may be compelled to take upon 
itself the direct duties of parent, since the proper parental 
authority has failed“ Furthermore, instead of a temporary 
removal of the child, he may be permanently secured 
against the jurisdiction of his blood relatives, but even in 
taking this step the bond of parental affection must not 
be overlooked. The sacrifice of the latter may outweigh 
the advantages of separation. Accordingly the various 
factors in the problem — the parent, the home, and the 
child — must each be given due weight, and the disposition 
of a case should be determined on the basis of the relative 
importance of each factor. 4 
2. Types or DEPENDENTS. 
There are many dependent and neglected children repre- 
senting numerous types and forms of dependency. One 
group of children consists of those who are crippled or de- 
formed from birth. Although their number is not large, 
accommodations for their advantage are usually lacking ; 
and thus they become a grievous burden to their parents 
and fail to receive the care and attention which they merit. 
A portion are curable, or may at least be made partially 
self-supporting, if they are provided with the proper medi- 
cal and educational facilities. Institutional care for this 
class is undoubtedly the wisest form of prescription. 
A second class includes illegitimate children, foundlings, 
and abandoned infants. Society has very unjustly charged 
such children with the blame of their ignoble birth, and 
their entire lives have been spent under the handicap of 
such a terrible injustice. These infants deserve every 
 
-P-A-G-E-301
EE _ 
THE DEPENDENT AND NEGLECTED CHILD 295 
consideration given to the legitimate child, and equal pro- 
vision for their care should be made. Their parents must 
indeed be held responsible as far as possible and a burden 
be placed upon them, but the child should not be sacri- 
ficed because of another’s guilt. The French experiment 
of relieving parents of responsibility for illegitimate chil- 
dren proved extremely disastrous. It not only increased 
illegitimacy, but enormously increased the number of 
foundlings and was necessarily abandoned. In the United 
States the number of illegitimate children is relatively 
small and the number of foundlings quite insignificant, ex- 
cept in the large cities where shame can be concealed and 
where poverty often pinches. 
A large number of children, especially in our industrial 
centers and in the congested portions of our cities, can not 
be comfortably provided for by their parents. Frequently 
the mother is forced to spend the day in the factory, and 
her children are either neglected or placed in the care of 
a small daughter —a ‘‘child mother.” Again, among the 
poor, medical attention is often omitted because financial 
means are wanting, and accordingly children do not re- 
cover fully from disease; scars, traces, and minor defects 
remain, and sometimes more serious defects permanently 
handicap the child. Scarlet fever, which ig especially 
severe on the poor, is one of the most malignant of these 
diseases. This group of children constitutes a semi- 
neglected class, and the neglect frequently leads to such 
conditions of subnormality as will render the individual 
barely self-supporting on his reaching maturity. The 
day nursery, summer outings, playgrounds, medical in- 
spection of the schools, and in some cases direct assistance, 
tend to prevent complete dependence and partially over- 
come the natural effects of neglect. 
The largest group of children considered in this class are 
those who for various reasons are partially or completely 
   
-P-A-G-E-302
296 CHILD PROBLEMS 
dependent upon society. Many are without natural 
family support, owing to the desertion of the father, and 
in the absence of the latter the state may be forced to pro- 
vide for the children. Some are orphans, but if part of 
the family still remains, the method of provision will de- 
pend upon the advisability of keeping the remainder of 
the family together. Charitable agencies sometimes quite 
properly pension a widowed mother or father of a large 
family when investigation proves that the family can be 
reared to better advantage if it remains united. In some 
cases parents are temporarily or permanently disabled, 
and their children must therefore be given temporary 
relief. 
Cruelty is but the superlative degree of neglect, there- 
fore the victims of neglect and of cruelty belong to the 
same category. “The neglected child is one for whom 
parents fail to care or provide so that the child suffers 
from actual want or is demoralized.” The following case 
occurring in New York City illustrates the type. Investi- 
gation by the New York Society for the Prevention of 
Cruelty to Children disclosed “ two children, aged six and 
four years respectively, badly neglected by a drunken 
mother. The surroundings were filthy, the mother almost 
hopelessly intoxicated, the children quite nude, and a sister 
of the mother lay dying from consumption on a bed of rags 
near by.” Refusal of the father to turn over a sufficient 
amount of his regular wages to the mother to enable her 
to care for the children properly also constitutes a frequent 
cause of neglect. “The laxity of parents who allow children 
to indulge in pernicious associations, to beg, frequent 
saloons and gambling houses, and sleep away from home, 
subjects such parents to the charge of neglect and cruelty # 
The grosser forms of cruelty usually”consist of beating 
and similar abuses of children. Parents often frighten their 
sons by excessive corporal punishment ; the latter become 
 
-P-A-G-E-303
THE DEPENDENT AND NEGLECTED CHI 
refractory, only to suffer still more from the cruelty of t! 
father. Neither the wife beater nor the child beater has 
become extinct. Cruelty often drives the boy away from 
home, but being without friends or experience, he goes from 
bad to worse until his pitiable state may finally draw 
attention to himself. and to the causes of his misfortune. 
Such cases differ from pure dependency in that, not only 
must a proper disposition be made of the child, but the 
parent must be punished for his offense. 
3. Causes or DEPENDENCY. 
The prevention of dependency furnishes one of the most 
difficult: of all child problems. A very large percentage 
of dependency is at present uncontrollable. A radical 
reconstruction of social relations would be necessary to 
prevent its regular recurrence. Hereditary influences, 
unexpected death of parent or natural supporter, industrial 
maladjustments, sickness, and many other causes of de- 
pendency can be remedied with difficulty. Nevertheless 
the situation is not hopeless, and much dependency among 
children can be mitigated, and some of it can be entirely 
prevented. The causes differ materially from the causes 
of dependency among adults. Since no adequate Amer- 
ican statistics are available, no detailed study of causes 
can be given. Warner quotes German statistics on de- 
pendent children,! but the figures, which were compiled by 
Béhmert, are now more than fifteen years old at least. 
The percentages, however, still have value. According 
to these figures, the chief causes of dependency among 
13,000 children were distributed as follows: orphanage, 
38.75 per cent; lack of work on part of guardian, 14.90; 
sickness, etc., 11.88; abandonment by guardian, 11.66; 
imprisonment of guardian, 4.7; abuse and neglect, 4.5; 
1 Warner, Amos, American Charities, p. 43 of First Edition, p. 54 of 
Revised Edition. 
 
-P-A-G-E-304
       
   
  CHILD PROBLEMS 
ess of guardian, 4.34; laziness of guardian, 3.49; 
drunkenness of guardian, 1.54; mental or physical defect 
in guardian, 1.74. The remaining causes are of minor 
importance. According to Béhmert, one fourth of the chil- 
dren are dependent owing to causes controlled by their 
parents or guardians. He has, however, included only 
the more palpable culpability of parents, omitting lack 
\,of work, sickness, and of course orphanage. To a large 
icaree sek of work depends on the inefficiency of the 
parent, and is a remediable evil Furthermore much 
sickness could be avoided by the exercise of a little more 
intelligence. The amount of unnecessary dependency 
is therefore much larger than the estimate given above. 
Eventually the lessening of the death rate through the 
decrease of the number of accidents, better sanitation, 
the elimination of certain diseases especially prevalent 
among the poor, and a lower occupational mortality will 
decrease the aggregate amount of orphanage. Consid- 
erable time will, however, be necessary for the realization 
of these reforms. 
“\ The large families among the poor are an additional 
cause of dependency. Rountree showed that in York, 
England, the proportion of actual poverty due to the 
existence of large families was 22.16 per cent. The death 
of one of the parents in such cases almost necessarily makes 
the children at least partially dependent. Frequently 
temporary aid in the home is sufficient to meet such needs, 
but often the family must be separated. Excessive re- 
production, coupled with precarious economic conditions, 
.« make considerable relief necessary. 
-\ The number of dependent children is closely related to 
the prevailing relief policy. Certain systems foster the 
increase of dependents, while others as faithfully diminish 
their number. Unwise philanthropy undoubtedly accen- 
tuates the problem. The orphanage and institution have 
 
-P-A-G-E-305
ee 
THE DEPENDENT AND NEGLECTED CHILD 299 
not reduced dependency to a minimum, but have rather 
tended to prevent the greatest possible reduction. The 
proportion of dependent children in the state of New York, 
which uses the institutional method, is much larger than 
in other states where placing out methods are used. How- 
ever, there are other reasons why New York should have 
an unusually large number of dependent children. 
Cruelty and alcoholism are allied causes of dependency 
One large western home-finding society reports that a 
majority of its cases are at least partially the result of 
alcoholism. The New York Society for the Prevention 
of Cruelty to Children has published in one of its annual 
reports the following statement : “Reference to the records 
of the society during the entire years of its existence would 
establish beyond all controversy the fact that to the ex- 
cessive use of intoxicants by parents is largely due the 
great neglect, the suffering, and grosser forms of cruelty 
imposed upon childhood. It has been the province of the 
Society to respond to constant appeals made for the pro- 
tection of children against drunken and brutal parents.” + 
Drunkenness easily degenerates into brutality. In many 
cases the mother is an offender as well as the father. In 
some cities, the proportion of neglect directly attributable 
to intemperance is much smaller than that credited to New 
York City. 
Abnormal family conditions play an important part 
in causing neglect. In a typical city, in nearly 20 per 
cent of the cases the parents had separated, the child usually 
living with the mother. In 12 per cent the child lived 
with the father, the mother being dead or living elsewhere ; 
in 25 per cent the mother held the child, the father being 
dead or having abandoned the family; in 10 per cent of 
the cases, step-parents complicated matters; and a small 
1 Annual Report of New York Society for Prevention of Cruelty to 
Children, 1908. 
 
-P-A-G-E-306
300 CHILD PROBLEMS 
percentage of children were entirely abandoned.! The 
desire of the child in the great majority of cases to go with 
the mother on her separation from the father indicates 
the comparative worthlessness and cruelty of many fathers. 
Illegitimates and children of immoral parents are often 
neglected, and in one large city about 50 per cent of the 
neglected children receiving public care had been deserted 
by their fathers. Private philanthropy, however, had 
charge of a large number of the neglected children of the 
city, so the net proportion of deserted cases was much 
smaller. ‘Improper guardianship,” which forms the 
usual charge against the parents of neglected children, 
besides being attributable to drunkenness, abnormal 
family relations, and child desertion, depends upon a cruel 
disposition, ignorance of the temptations which beset 
children, indifference, and extreme selfishness. 
4. Numper or DEPENDENT CHILDREN. 
The exact number of dependent and neglected children 
in the United States is not known, as statistics are not 
available for the children who have been boarded out and 
placed out. The number of children in institutions, 
however, has been tabulated by the federal government. 
The following table gives the number of children in such 
institutions and the number admitted during the year 
1904, in the United States and the most densely populated 
states. 
The states of Indiana, Missouri, New Jersey, and Mary- 
land each held in their orphanages and children’s homes 
more than two thousand children. The number of in- 
mates in the remaining states was much less. These 
statistics show a tremendous disparity among the states 
as to the proportion of children in homes of the kind desig-

nated. In several of the western states the number and 
proportion of institution children is quite negligible. In 
these, either the dependent children are not largely repre- 
sented in institutions or the actual number is much smaller. 
Both contingencies are probable and must be considered 
in an estimate of the total number of dependent children. 
Some states use the institution more extensively than do 
others, and their statistics therefore create false impres- 
sions. New York contains in its orphanages and homes 
more than one fourth of the children found in such insti- 
tutions throughout the United States. It follows the 
District of Columbia with the second largest proportion of 
inmates per given unit of population. In several states the 
children pass rapidly through the institutions, and therefore 
the number_admitted during the year is larger than the 
number remaining at its close. Setting aside these modi- 
fying factors, we find that more than 92,000 children were 
in such institutions at the close of the year 1904. In addi- 
tion to this a considerable number of children were at the 
1 Benevolent Institutions. Special Report of Bureau of the Census, 
1904, pp. 26 ff.

same time inmates of other institutions. In ‘Permanent 
Homes” for adults and children the number enumerated 
was 5625, New York and Texas having each more than 
700. The movement of children through these homes 
was, however, almost as rapid as the movement though 
the orphanages. The “Temporary Homes”’ form another 
class of institutions. These contained 8124 children, 
although the number of admissions during the year aggre- 
gated 23,032. The average stay of each child was accord- 
ingly a little more than four months, while the average stay 
in the other institutions was somewhat more than one 
year. New York led with 2949 inmates, and 10,404 
admissions. 
The aggregate number of children in institutions on 
December 31, 1904, was 106,038. Among this number 
are included infants in foundling asylums, illegitimate 
children, and a small number of incorrigibles and cripples. 
With very little variation, however, the figure given repre- 
sents the sum total of dependent children in institutions 
in the United States. The great disparity in proportions 
among the various states indicates that many of them 
have disposed of their dependent children in other ways. 
The boarding and placing out system accounts for thou- 
sands of such children, but the exact number is not known. 
According to estimates made, there are at the present 
time about 50,000 children in foster homes or being boarded 
at the cost of some society or other agency. The total num- 
ber of dependent children thus rises to an aggregate of 
more than 150,000. Some of the neglected children fall 
into the hands of placing-out societies and of institutions, 
and are therefore enumerated in the foregoing figures. A 
considerable class of neglected children, however, do not 
figure in the statistical tables. They are the less serious _ 
cases, it is true; nevertheless they are not living under 
normal conditions and are suffering from the handicap of 
uncertain training and precarious family life.

CHAPTER II 
PRINCIPLES OF CHILD SAVING 
1. Puactne Out vs. THE INSTITUTION. 
Social workers were long divided into two camps on the 
question of the proper method of caring for dependent 
children. One party advocated the institutional plan 
and favored the orphanage, the children’s home, the per- 
manent home, and industrial schools where children should 
be brought up to adult life. Without natural supporters 
they would, it was believed, prosper better in some insti- 
tution where discipline, education, moral instruction, good 
environment, physical training, and other advantages 
could be provided. This party pointed out the defects 
of the placing-out system, and the unsatisfactory results 
that the latter formerly achieved. The advocates of the 
placing-out system, on the other hand, insisted on the 
absence of real family life in the institution, they pointed 
out the manifold evils of aggregation, of the absence of 
individuation, and of the unnatural conditions and sur- 
roundings of an institution. They claimed great advan- 
tages for the home and. for its favorable moral environment, 
and contended that life away from the temptations and 
pitfalls of a large city and outside of an institution would 
yield the best results. Even the temporary home was 
opposed by the most radical advocates of the placing-out 
plan. 
The contending parties gradually weakened in their 
303
-P-A-G-E-310
ee ap po 
304 CHILD PROBLEMS 
opposition to each other, and finally sought to harmonize 
their differences. Some good in institutions was discov- 
ered, and the value of the placing-out system was definitely 
recognized. In 1899 the National Conference of Charities 
and Correction adopted a report which ended the strife 
and set forth the principles of child saving on a permanent 
basis. These principles are restated in the report of 1906, 
and an elaborate exposition has been published in the 
report of the White House Conference in 1909.1 
2. PrincipLes or CHILD Savina. 
The principles concerning which there is now substantial 
agreement are the following : — 
(1) Preservation of home ties wherever possible. 
(2) The paramount importance of preventive work. 
(3) The superiority of the foster home as asubstitute for 
the natural home. 
(4) The use of the institution for temporary purposes 
only, except for feeble-minded, epileptic, and certain 
crippled, deformed, and otherwise incurable children. 
(5) The incorporation of child-caring agencies. 
(6) The adoption of the cottage plan for institutions. 
(7) State inspection of the work of child-caring agencies. 
(8) Education in institutions as part of the public edu- 
cational system. 
(9) The keeping of adequate records. 
(10) Codperation among child-caring agencies. 
(11) Undesirability of legislation by states so as to han- 
dicap the placing out of children from other states. 
(12) The need of a national association on the care of 
dependent children. 
(13) A federal Children’s Bureau.

3.. Tue Foster Home. 
The value of the home tie can not be too strongly em- 
phasized. Its severance may work untold hardships when 
a slightly different form of aid might serve to tide over 
a temporary difficulty. When the trouble is not perma- 
nent, the home should rarely be broken up. Every reason- 
able effort shquld be made to keep together the family of 
a worthy and willing widow or widower. A certain class 
of homes, however, can not remain unmolested. This 
class is usually the concern of the Society for the Preven- 
tion of Cruelty to Children. The gross neglect and cruelty 
cases often require that the child be permanently removed 
from the home. Dr. E. T. Devine says, ‘If children are 
removed because their parents are morally unfit guardians 
for them, this removal should be unconditional. There 
should be no hesitation in transferring the legal guar- 
dianship in such cases.”! While the burden of proof to 
show parental incompetency rests upon the state, the 
latter has the undoubted right to interfere with the natural 
home relations when it becomes evident that the children 
are the victims of violently abnormal treatment. Board- 
ing out may be necessary if the number of desirable free 
homes is limited. Much of the opposition to the placing- 
out system was occasioned by the lax methods employed 
by home-finding societies. In former years a number 
of the eastern societies regularly sent a considerable num- 
ber of their dependent children to western states, and 
owing to the distance from the central offices, the children 
on the farms were inadequately supervised. The cruel 
and abusive treatment of the children was in many cases 
unknown to the society, and consequently the percentage 
of failures to secure good results was excessive. The 
fault, however, was not an inherent part of the system.

306 CHILD PROBLEMS 
It has been remedied by adequate organization and suffi- 
cient inspection and supervision. 
The well-regulated home being usually regarded as the 
best medium in which to develop the growing boy or girl, 
the most advisable step in connection with the dependent 
child is to secure for him some carefully selected foster 
home. In the home the child has the advantage of con- 
tact with his foster parents and with his playmates and 
is in touch with wholesome life. The normal child must 
meet persons and children of all ages. Otherwise his com- 
plete development can not be secured. When placed in 
the home the child enjoys the prospect of these advantages, 
but an institution is necessarily surrounded by artificial 
conditions, and therefore can not provide the training which 
natural contacts make possible. The ultimate goal is to 
secure the adoption of the child by the family, but if that 
is not possible, to have him placed in a free home subject 
to regular supervision by the home-finding society. Child- 
less couples are frequently anxious to adopt one or more 
promising children, and partiality of parents toward par- 
ticular children is not likely in such cases. The right to 
remove the child placed on probation in a family protects 
the children who have been unfortunately located. Sim- 
ilar rights of rejection allow would-be foster parents to 
release undesirable children. 
4. Tue Corrace Puan. 
The cottage plan is as desirable for institutions caring 
for dependent children as for those containing juvenile 
delinquents. As the merits of the system have been dis- 
cussed in a previous chapter, no repetition of the argument 
is necessary. In view of the fact that more than 100,000 
children are at the present time located in institutions 
throughout the United States, the adoption of the cottage 
plan is an important consideration. The large majority 
 
-P-A-G-E-313
  PRINCIPLES OF CHILD SAVING 307 
of institutions are found within city limits, and but a small 
proportion of all our institutions have adopted the cottage 
plan. Although the desirability of the system is fully 
recognized among social workers, the financial condition 
of institutions has prevented them from introducing the 
cottage system as rapidly as desirable. To meet this 
shortcoming it is the more necessary for home-finding 
societies to exert themselves to the utmost to find suitable 
homes for the dependent children. Furthermore, if the 
public realized more fully the value of the cottage plan, the 
necessary funds for its installation might be forthcoming. 
5. State Supervision AND INCORPORATION OF PRI- 
vaTE AGENCIES. 
The work of private philanthropy is being increasingly 
regarded as properly subject to the supervision of the state. 
This applies to hospitals, dispensaries, homes, etc., as well 
as to institutions and agencies caring for dependent chil- 
dren. In order that private charity may meet more rigid 
requirements, state inspection of its work is advisable. 
In most states, public authority provides to some extent 
for dependent children and private societies are merely 
covering part of the field. State inspection guarantees 
a higher degree of efficiency among these societies, and 
tends to unify the work. Even strong private societies 
have in some cases enhanced the efficiency of the more 
doubtful philanthropic agencies by refusing to codperate 
with the latter or by keeping on file a record of their 
relative efficiency. A number of states, notably New 
York, Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota have 
established state inspection of the child-caring and the 
placing-out work of private societies. In Indiana a very 
progressive law recently passed requires every private 
child-caring agency to secure an annual license from the 
board of state charities, 
 
-P-A-G-E-314
nn 
308 CHILD PROBLEMS 
The incorporation of child-caring agencies is desirable 
in order to increase the responsibility of such societies and 
to insure for them the confidence of the public. Philan- 
thropic men refuse to give money to charities of doubtful 
efficiency, and many of the most prominent agencies were 
incorporated before legal compulsion was considered. 
However, numerous small societies of uncertain standing 
would probably discontinue if incorporation were made 
legally obligatory. A greater measure of control over 
such charities would also be realized and their general 
efficiency enhanced. 
6. Co6PERATION. 
Passing over the questions of education and the keep- 
ing of adequate records, the value of codperation among 
child-saving societies can not be too strongly emphasized. 
Hard and fast lines between dependent and delinquent 
children are no longer favored. The National Conference 
of Charities and Correction discusses them under a single 
head. The essential unity of the problems of dependency 
and delinquency is now recognized and the functions of the 
juvenile courts are being very properly expanded. Fur- 
thermore, greater codperation between home-finding and 
aid societies and societies taking charge of cruelty cases 
is desirable. So, too, institutions could make better use 
of the societies and could use them for the purpose of 
placing out their children. The disinclination of some 
institutions to give up their children is a bar to such co- 
operation. One New York City home for destitute chil- 
dren stipulates in advance that no child will be received 
for less than a year, although few children should be per- 
mitted to remain that period of time in any orphanage 
or home for dependent children. 
The most significant recent movement in the direction 
of codperation was the establishment in Philadelphia in
-P-A-G-E-315

PRINCIPLES OF CHILD SAVING 309 
1907 of a children’s bureau by the joint action of the Chil- 
dren’s Aid Society of Pennsylvania and the Seybert In- 
stitution for Poor Boys and Girls. In 1908 the Pennsyl- 
vania Society to Protect Children from Cruelty joined the 
others in the work of the bureau. The management of 
the bureau is vested in a joint committee of six persons, 
the president and secretary or superintendent of each 
agency being selected for this purpose. This committee 
supervises the work of the bureau. A superintendent 
is placed in immediate charge of the applications, and has 
control of the agents. This joint bureau makes it pos- 
sible to refer each case at once to the particular agency 
best prepared to handle the problem. Duplication of 
effort and the referral of cases from one society to another 
is thus avoided. In this instance three societies of differ- 
ent character, and to some extent of different purpose, 
although performing much identical work, have wisely 
hit upon a plan of codéperation which greatly facilitates 
their work and enhances their efficiency in child saving. 
Very successful codperation is being carried on in Boston 
where seven child-caring agencies use identical record 
blanks and work together in other ways. 
In some cities temporary homes for children, orphan 
homes, and the board of education have coédperated faith- 
fully with child-saving societies and with the juvenile 
court for the purpose of assisting in the disposition of 
juvenile delinquents, and especially for the placing of de- 
pendent and neglected children. In Kansas City an 
institutional church maintains a temporary home for 
neglected children and coéperates directly with the agencies 
having immediate charge of the childrén. Denomina- 
tional jealousies and the fear that children will be placed 
with foster parents professing antagonistic religions are 
among the obstacles to better codperation between insti- 
tutions and home-finding societies. The essential prin-
-P-A-G-E-316

ciples and methods of child saving being agreed upon, 
these various agencies should be able to yield a maximum of 
good results. 
7. CHILDREN IN ALMSHOUSES. 
A principle of action generally accepted but still seriously 
violated in actual practice in many places is the unde- 
sirability of sheltering children in almshouses. The bru- 
tality of the custom of placing children in poorhouses 
became so evident that other accommodations have been 
provided for them in the great majority of cases. In many 
of the country almshouses little children may, however, be 
found even now. A recent investigation of Missouri 
almshouses showed that in more than one third of the 
entire number, children were being maintained. Several 
of our largest cities also allow children to remain in such 
houses, but frequently these children are feeble-minded 
or otherwise slightly defective. Inadequate facilities for 
the custody of the idiotic and feeble-minded have com- 
pelled many children of these classes to suffer the neglect 
which accompanies their life in the almshouse. Although 
no children of any kind should be allowed in any of our 
almshouses, the objection to infants under two years of 
age is less serious than that to children of considerable 
mental advancement. The latter are almost sure to suffer 
seriously from their association with the degenerates con- 
gregated in an almshouse. 
8. Derective CHILDREN. 
The principles of child saving as outlined above do not 
apply to feeble-minded, idiotic, epileptic, and incurably 
diseased children, who should be given permanent insti- 
tutional care. The perpetuation of a bad heredity must 
be checked, and the helplessness of the children makes 
special care advisable. Such principles as tend to facilitate 
 
-P-A-G-E-317
NN ECT EE 
PRINCIPLES OF CHILD SAVING 311 
the work of agencies dealing with this class of cases are, 
however, applicable here, and the cottage system is equally 
desirable for institutions for defectives. The problem 
of the defective child does not fall within the province 
of this book, and therefore can only receive casual men- 
tion here. 
The principles and methods of child saving center about 
the fundamental fact that the interests of the child are 
paramount. Adequate care for children is the most effec- 
tive form of preventive work. The child of to-day becomes 
the useful citizen or the adult dependent or delinquent 
of to-morrow. The status and conditions of future society 
are contingent upon our present methods of providing for 
our children. The importance of the home as an insti- 
tution surmounts the value of a child, but the children 
of any particular home are to be preferred to the continua- 
tion of that home. The child rather than the parent is 
the proper object of consideration. The child is the man 
in the making, and it is work well worth doing well.

CHAPTER III 
METHODS OF CHILD SAVING. PRIVATE 
1. Tue Cuipren’s Amp Society. 
Although public agencies have in most states made 
some provision for dependent children, the bulk of the 
work has been accomplished by private organizations of 
various description. Aid and home-finding societies have 
been organized in a majority of the different states. They 
are committed to the placing-out principle ; hence a chief 
feature of their work consists in finding suitable homes 
for the children placed under their care. On the other 
hand, the prohibition of placing children in almshouses has 
resulted in the improper use of aid societies as a depository 
for dependent children. The societies no longer compete 
with public charity, but are used by public officials as a 
necessary part of charitable organization. 
The typical aid society is an undenominational organi- 
zation of private philanthropy, and ranks as the most 
scientific in method of the child-saving agencies of a com- 
munity. It is controlled by a board of directors usually 
representing the principal contributors to the funds of the 
society. A public account of their stewardship is annually 
given, contributions being entirely voluntary. The work- 
ing force of the society consists of the secretary or super- 
intendent, placing-out and visiting agents, some of whom 
may reside in distant states in case the society transports 
some of its charges to such states. Many of the societies 
are equipped with temporary homes for the housing of the 
312
-P-A-G-E-319
a a ia a i a 
METHODS OF CHILD SAVING. PRIVATE 313 
homeless and dependent children. Even in the more 
antagonistic societies, the opposition to the institution 
has collapsed sufficiently to pave the way for the use of 
the temporary home. 
2. GurpiIna PRINCIPLES. 
The principles which govern the activities of the chil- 
dren’s aid societies vary in different places. In the larg- 
est cities the needs are so extensive that a great variety 
of labors is undertaken. This is especially true of the 
New York Society. The scope of its work is not at all 
confined to the task of caring for dependent children, and 
in addition to placing out, many other forms of philan- 
thropic work are undertaken. ‘The fundamental prin- 
ciple of the society and its governing motive is that of 
‘self-help’ — of teaching children how to help themselves. 
It also advocates that the ‘farmer’s home’ is the best pos- 
sible place to shelter and rear the orphan, or outcast child, 
far better than any asylum or the best managed public 
. institution.” 1 Accordingly it has sent large numbers 
Pof children to western states, available room not having 
. been found in the East for all of the children to be cared 
for. 
The stated principles of the Pennsylvania Children’s 
Aid Society are more detailed, and typify the fundamentals 
of a large number of these societies. They are as follows: 
“We are trying to accomplish four things: Ist, to keep 
in our office information concerning every child-caring in- 
stitution in the city, and a list of private family homes, 
both in the city and surrounding country, where children 
can be received and cared for, so that we may know at any 
time and in any case of child-need just what can be done. 
2d, to use existing institutions and create no new ones. 
3d, to scatter children into private homes and small   1 Report of the New York Children’s Aid Society, 1908.
-P-A-G-E-320
Le pe 
314 CHILD PROBLEMS 
institutions rather than to congregate them into large ones. 
4th, to put the support of a child upon its legal guardians 
whenever possible.” !| Some of the societies, instead of 
erecting their own temporary homes, have been able to 
coéperate with institutions which allow them temporary 
lodging for their charges. The best societies strive to 
keep dependent children in their own homes or with their 
natural supporters wherever such action is practicable 
and expedient. 
38. Work or THE New York Society. 
The actual work accomplished in no case excels the fine 
record of the New York Society, which was founded in 
1853. Previously to 1908 it placed 26,268 orphans and 
deserted children in family homes in the country. It 
provided situations at wages in the country for 26,889 
older beys and girls, and returned 7731 runaway children 
to their parents. It also assisted poor persons, num- 
bering 46,025, mostly children, to reach friends and em- 
ployment in the West. The work accomplished and the y 
variety of its labors during the year 1908 are signified by 4 
the following statistics, which are given in some detail be- 
cause they indicate not only the kind of aid needed by 
children, but also because they show the emphasis placed 
by the society upon the different forms of aid and relief. 
During the year 12,639 children were enrolled in its in- 
dustrial schools ; 10,144 were given relief in their homes ; 
8248 boys and girls were sheltered in its lodging houses ; 
1270 attended the farm school; 8945 persons were given 
an outing varying from one to four weeks; 6649 women 
and children received single day outings; 685 orphan 
children were permanently placed in homes; 862 chil- 
dren were placed in homes at wages; 865 boys and girls 
with their parents were assisted to emigrate ; 528 children 
  1 Report of the Pennsylvania Children’s Aid Society, 1908.
-P-A-G-E-321
  METHODS OF CHILD SAVING. PRIVATE 315 
were returned to their relatives; 686 homeless mothers 
and children were given shelter; and 2334 children were 
treated in the Sick Children’s Mission. 
In the Society’s industrial schools work was carried on 
in classes studying the following subjects: cobbling, car- 
pentry, basketry, chair caning, cooking, dressmaking, 
sewing, iron and wire bending, millinery, embroidery, 
embossing, designing, and pyrography. Both day and 
night schools were conducted. Four lodging houses for 
homeless boys were established, and by means of coépera- 
tion with the municipal lodging house and private charities, 
boys and young men under twenty-one years of age were 
provided for temporarily so as to avoid the contact with 
older vagrants. One of the happiest forms of labor was 
the sending of the ailing children and their mothers to the 
health home on, the ocean beach. Receiving stations 
were opened, each equipped with physician and nurse 
detailed to discover the most needy children and order 
their transportation to the home. 
4. Piacine Out. 
The most important work of the average children’s aid 
society consists of finding homes for its wards. The 
method of disposal, however, is not uniform, and leads to 
the frequent use of the society by public charities, private 
institutions, and other charitable agencies for the disposal 
of the children under their care. It may become the 
placing-out machine used in common by the other forms 
of organized charity. Children may be placed with fam- 
ilies or individuals under one of three conditions, — in- 
dentured, boarded out, or placed out in free homes. The 
last is the most desirable, provided a suitable family home 
can be obtained. The best homes, according to Homer 
Folks, are those in which children are grown up and gone, 
but where the child will be received as a member of the 
   
-P-A-G-E-322
i 
316 CHILD PROBLEMS 
family, and those in which no children have appeared but 
one or more are earnestly desired. Experienced foster 
parents are likely to be more successful, but the child in 
the home of the childless is certain to receive ample atten- 
tion. The child who is added to a home in which there 
are other children is often discriminated against, and this 
can only be discovered by careful supervision. 
In order to find a suitable home it is necessary to ask ~ 
for applications for children or to find homes willing to 
receive them. Many societies constantly receive appli- 
cations and only need to consider their merits. Appli- 
eants should be required to make detailed statements in 
regard to the pertinent features of their home and home 
life. Among the questions which they should be required 
to answer are the following : occupation; financial status ; 
if a farmer, size and ownership of farm; distance from 
church or Sunday school; distance from school; con- 
ditions within the home; general environmental condi- 
tions; purpose in regard to the child; proposed social 
status of the child ; sleeping accommodations ; nationality 
and age of applicants, their habits, character, social con- 
nections, their treatment of employees, and the number 
of children. A list of about fifty questions is usually 
required. The answers often indicate the uselessness of 
further investigation, especially when they convey un- 
favorable impressions. The applicant is required to give 
a number of references, and persons familiar with the 
conditions of the applicant are the recipients of inquiries. 
Furthermore, agents are usually sent out to interview the 
applicants in their homes and to collect such other informa- 
tion as may seem necessary or expedient. 
A large number of children are not adapted to certain 
homes, and must be replaced before securing a satisfactory 
location. This can only be avoided by a most careful 
selection of the initial home. Success depends upon tem-  
-P-A-G-E-323
a a aa i I a 
METHODS OF CHILD SAVING. PRIVATE 317 
peramental and religious considerations as well as upon 
the physical and moral fitness of the home. As much as 
possible children should be placed with families of similar 
religious tendencies. The child who is old enough to have 
received religious training particularly requires this mode 
of disposition. The small children, however, are not torn 
from any denominational bias and therefore not injured 
by being placed with families of different religious belief 
from that of their parents. Denominational considera- 
tions are not the most important ones, and must yield 
when the general welfare of the child is at stake. To be 
placed out in a good home where some other religion is 
taught is far superior to being placed in a doubtful home 
that may satisfy the religious requirements of some in- 
tolerant agent or institution. Good homes rather than 
creed form the child’s character and develop correct morals. 
A second consideration requiring precaution is the se- 
lection of a child adapted to the particular family home. 
The physical appearance of the child may affect the preju- 
dices of the family. Likewise the type of mind may be 
such as to make the new relation unpleasant for both 
parties. Temperamental harmony is needed to insure 
success. Foster parents may be successful with one type 
of mind and utter failures with another. Even before the 
child is placed on trial with the family, these considerations 
should be emphasized so as to avoid unnecessary removals 
from family to family. Parents should, if possible, see the 
prospective child before he leaves the child saving agency. 
This would tend to lessen delay and misfits. 
The third step in the disposition of the child is that of 
placing him in his newly secured home. The head of the 
home in which the child is placed usually signs a written 
agreement in which he promises to treat the child in ac- 
cordance with the standards required by the society or 
agency. Among these requirements we generally find 
 
-P-A-G-E-324
ee 
318 CHILD PROBLEMS 
the following: to treat him kindly and as a member of the 
family, to cause him to attend church and Sunday school, 
to provide him with a public school education, to teach 
him an occupation so as to make him self-supporting, to 
give him ample clothing both for week days and Sundays, 
and to give him proper food and suitable medical attend- 
ance. These agreements can be canceled by the child- 
saving agency whenever it deems it necessary for the 
welfare of the child, and a limited right of cancellation is 
also granted to the guardian. 
The fourth step is the supervision of the child in his 
new home. This supervision continues until the child is 
released from the control of the society. Many children 
are not adopted at all, and are supervised by the child- 
caring agency until their majority or until they are suffi- 
ciently mature to make further care unnecessary. Agents 
of the child-caring society visit the children in their new 
homes and learn of their progress and development. Guar- 
dians may become neglectful, indifference to the welfare of 
the child may arise, and fundamental changes occur in 
the family conditions or relations — all of which may con- 
duce to the disadvantage of the child. The history of 
placing out under inadequate supervision demonstrates the 
need of frequent visitation of children. 
Experience has also indicated the need of the following 
features in connection with the supervision of children in 
foster homes: first, visits to be effective should be made 
quarterly or oftener. Unfortunately this is not usually 
done, and many failures are either never discovered or are 
unearthed long after the child has begun to suffer from his 
uncongenial environment. Second, visits should be made 
without previous notice to guardians. The conditions 
which actually obtain can not otherwise be discovered. 
Third, written reports made out by the agents should be 
on file in the office of the society so that the condition of
-P-A-G-E-325
  METHODS OF CHILD SAVING. PRIVATE 319 
the child can be continuously followed. A report should 
cover all the essential details regarding the progress of the 
child. Fourth, the judgment of the agent should deter- 
mine the advisability of allowing the child to remain or 
of requiring his removal. Additional means of securing 
adequate knowledge of the conditions of the child are 
usually employed. Reports are sent by the teacher of 
the school attended, by the pastor of the church, by the 
Sunday school teacher, and by the guardian directly. 
Agents of the state or county in some states also visit 
children and report as to the conditions under which they 
found them. In New York, officials are required to report 
to the State Board of Charities every month. 
5. Dirricuttres or Piacina Ovrt. 
The difficulties of placing .out are twofold — those 
affecting the child and those affecting the guardian. When 
a large number of children must be disposed of, the number 
of free homes may be insufficient to meet the demands. 
Accordingly only the more likely children can be placed, 
while those suffering from deformities, weaknesses, illegiti- 
mate origin, and marked racial tendencies, can be placed 
only with difficulty or must be boarded or otherwise pro- 
vided for. Again, little children, especially girls under 
three years of age, are placed more easily than the older 
children. The former are captivating and attractive, and 
have not yet suffered from the evil influence of the usual 
environment of the dependent child. The older children 
are often vicious and spoiled, and therefore applicants 
hesitate to select them. The outward expression of heredi- 
tary traits as well as the impressions made by a bad en- 
vironment realize themselves in part long before the age 
limit beyond which societies usually decline to accept chil- 
dren for placing out. Such children suffer greatly from 
this disadvantage, and are not so easily placed. 
 
-P-A-G-E-326
  320 CHILD PROBLEMS 
The difficulty in regard to prospective guardians con- 
sists largely of the selfish or economic motive which prompts 
them to attempt to secure children from the placing-out 
agency. The older children are wanted because of their 
ability to work. Many farmers apply for children in the 
spring of the year when work is plentiful and help is needed. 
Other applicants have use for a handy boy, while girls are 
often wanted for household purposes. Extreme caution 
is necessary on the part of the investigating agency in order 
to insure the rejection of all applications for children 
wanted for mere mercenary reasons, and without effec- 
tive supervision harsh treatment might not be discovered 
and the child be victimized for several years. 
6. Tue Temporary Home. 
The temporary home has become a valuable adjunct 
of the Home-Finding Society. Children are taken to these 
homes before they are placed out, but are retained no 
longer than necessary to find them an agreeable home, 
except in a limited number of cases which require the dis- 
cipline of short institutional treatment. The vicious 
and unmanageable children are at a disadvantage, and are 
likely to fail unless the curative discipline of the temporary 
home is provided for them. In a short time they may be 
ready for the family home. It is probable that a larger 
percentage of children who have temporary institutional 
treatment are successful, than of those placed out without 
preliminary training. 
7. Resuits THE Pxiacinc-OuT System. 
The precise ‘ wults of placing out as a policy of child- 
saving still remain undetermined.!. Reports vary widely 
in their judgment on this point. In spite of utmost pre- 
1 The Russell Sage Foundation has recently undertaken an investiga- 
tion of this subject.
-P-A-G-E-327
ae ee a ee ee 
METHODS OF CHILD SAVING. PRIVATE 321 
cautions, a large number of children must be placed twice 
or oftener before a congenial home can be found. It has 
been estimated that 50 per cent of all children must be 
replaced.‘ After the transfers are made the great majority 
of children are measurably successful. The New York 
Society estimates that 87 per cent of the children which it 
placed out are “doing well.” The Michigan State School 
reports that in 1908, 75 per cent of the children placed 
out belong to this class, and most of the remainder were 
reported as doing “fairly well.” The number of failures 
was small. A small percentage of children, however, 
disappear entirely, and a few are sent to reformatory in- 
stitutions. Those doing poorly are usually boys and girls 
placed after they have reached the age of ten. At present 
the average age at which children are placed out by a 
number of our best child-caring agencies — public and 
private — ranges from five to six years. Good results 
may be expected from a policy of placing very young 
children. 
8. ADOPTION. 
It is desirable that the number of adoptions be as large 
as possible, as far as this may be consistent with the rights 
of parents. Sometimes the latter regain their ability to 
care for their children, and desire their return. Under 
certain conditions this should be allowed. The actual 
percentage of adoptions does not rise above 25 per cent, 
and for most agencies is considerably lower, often falling 
to mere nominal figures. Children are given a trial of 
about one year, after which they may be adopted. If this 
step is taken, the jurisdiction of the society ceases. The 
great bulk of children in the free homes become of age or 
self-supporting without being made members of the guar- 
dian’s family.

9. Dancers or INcomprTENT MANAGEMENT. 
The larger societies are very efficiently managed, but 
the smaller ones still suffer from inferior service. The 
New York Committee of the State Board of Charities, 
which investigates placing out in that state, has discovered 
conditions which indicate that, while the children were usu- 
ally well-fed and properly clothed, they suffered from the 
following disadvantages : — 
(1) Agents were careless in the selection of a home. 
(2) The preliminary examinations were far from being 
thorough. 
(83) Localities desired to shift the responsibility of caring 
for their dependent children. 
(4) Children were often transferred from one family 
to another independently of the action of a society. 
(5) School attendance was being neglected. 
Although these conditions are largely disappearing in 
New York, they still obtain in certain parts of the country. 1 
10. Neeps anp ReEForMs. 
Coéperation of child-saving agencies and their simpli- 
fication as well as reduction in numbers are among the 
greatest needs of to-day. A considerable number of small, 
ill-equipped agencies are.in existence, and their work is 
quite inferior to present standards. By combining and 
codperating, greater efficiency will be obtained. De- 
nominational friction prevents the needed reduction of 
agencies at present, but even here greater codperation is 
possible. A large nondenominational society is sufficient 
for a single state unless the presence of a large city necessi- 
tates some auxiliary aid. This can be furnished by a very 
limited number of sectarian agencies. Concentration 
of the work in the hands of a single administration would 
be more desirable, however. A children’s bureau acting
-P-A-G-E-329
  METHODS OF CHILD SAVING. PRIVATE 323 
as a clearing-house of cases marks the farthest step in 
advance. 
Efficient management is one of the important needs in 
child-saving agencies. Thorough organization is required 
so that children can be promptly and efficiently handled. 
The child ready to be placed out should not suffer from 
delays. There should be ample knowledge of the where- 
abouts of desirable homes. More trained officials are 
needed to carry on the work. Too often the social per- 
spective of the agent, or even of the secretary himself, is too 
narrow to make possible the best results. Hence children 
are poorly placed or undergo a demoralizing routine from 
which recovery is extremely difficult. The smaller societies 
especially need more trained officials. The larger ones, 
recognizing the need of efficient workers, have begun to 
train their own staff by requiring attendance at appro- 
priate lectures in schools of social work, or by organizing 
for themselves a course on child problems.

CHAPTER IV 
METHODS OF CHILD SAVING. PRIVATE (continued) 
1. SocrmTies FoR THE PREVENTION oF CRUELTY TO 
CHILDREN. 
Cases of destitution depending upon ill treatment, neg- 
lect, and cruelty are somewhat different from pure depend- 
ency cases, and are in many cities handled by separate 
organizations. The Humane or Prevention of Cruelty 
Societies were originated for this purpose. So little atten- 
tion was until recently paid to the neglected child that his 
interests were practically overlooked and nothing was done 
for him. Societies concerned with the prevention of cruelty 
were only organized within the last forty years. The New 
York City society was founded in 1874, and incorporated 
in the following year under a law enacted for the special 
purpose of giving such societies a legal standing. This 
pioneer work was followed by a wave of societies rising all 
over the United States. Many were formed during the 
seventies, and in the smaller cities and towns extensive 
organization has occurred during the last decade. In the 
majority of cases among the latter the “Humane Society” 
has been established, but in the large cities distinct societies 
for the prevention of cruelty to children are the rule. 
The original humane societies were interested in animals 
only and were organized for their protection. In the 
majority of cases, even now, in spite of the anomaly of the 
combination, they protect both children and animals from 
324
-P-A-G-E-331
COO 
METHODS OF CHILD SAVING. PRIVATE 325 
cruelty. This is especially true in the small cities, which 
can not afford two separate societies and therefore combine 
the two functions in one. In many instances the protection 
of children seems to have been an afterthought. Unfor- 
tunately the principles of action which determine policies 
in regard to children and to animals are so different that 
the society caring for both threatens to become warped 
in perspective, and applies to children the wrong kind of 
treatment. 
The character of organization usually agrees with the 
special conditions under which the work is done. Some 
societies have a state organization and conduct branches 
in various parts of the state. Of this type the Massachu- 
setts society is an example. Those of Ohio and Wisconsin 
enjoy still wider ramifications, and have a considerable 
number of branches. The best class of these societies is 
incorporated under the laws of the state. Some, however, 
limit their work to the city or county in which they are 
located. County incorporation is very common, especially 
among humane societies of the smaller towns of the West. 
Occasionally they take the form of city organizations, con- 
fining their work to the particular city or perhaps extending 
it to suburban sections. Sometimes the society is a branch 
or department of the charity organization society. 
Canada has a considerable number of protective societies, 
and the work has also been established abroad. The 
London organization operates throughout England, Wales, 
and Ireland and has more than one thousand centers of 
work. Paris has a society, and the one in Berlin has es- 
tablished five branch societies. More work of this kind 
is badly needed in other European countries. 
a. Functions of Societies.

follows: ‘The particular business of this society and

dren and the enforcement by all lawful means of the laws 
relating to or in any wise affecting children.” To carry 
out these objects the society may prefer complaints before 
the proper courts for the violation of laws affecting or 
relating to children and may aid in bringing the facts before 
the courts. The proper functions of such a society have 
been very concisely and ably stated by Mr. C. C. Carstens 
of Massachusetts : 1 — 
(1) “To prevent physical injury, remove the child when- 
ever it is necessary to protect it, and punish the offenders 
whenever the best interests of all concerned demand it. 
(2) “To prevent physical neglect ; in extreme cases to 
remove the children and find better homes for them through 
suitable agencies. 
(3) “To rescue children from immoral surroundings 
and shield them from immoral contamination. 
(4) “To protect wife and dependent children from non- 
support and desertion of the bread-winner and to protect 
children from abandonment by either parent. 
(5) “To secure suitable new guardians for children who 
have been deprived of their natural guardians or who should 
be removed from them in the interests of humanity.” 
The purposes thus stated include protection and amel- 
ioration of conditions for the neglected child and the pre- 
vention of contingencies which will cause the child to 
be victimized. Protection to the child is accomplished 
through the prosecution of cruel parents and guardians as 
well as through various devices for directly shielding the 
child from cruelty. The more conservative societies have 
largely confined their attention to remedial efforts, only 
cases of actual cruelty or violations of the laws safeguard- 
ing the interests of children being considered. Thus few 
homes are interfered with, and a vast amount of misery

remains entirely uncovered and unmolested. Meanwhile 
children suffer, become immoral or vicious, and are shorn 
of normal opportunities. Preventive work is needed, and 
therefore radical leaders have favored interference with 
family relations whenever the interests of the child seemed 
to be jeopardized. This, however, has led to the more 
extensive breaking of family ties than society justifies at 
the present time. Anti-cruelty societies have suffered 
from the charge that they were largely interested in the 
work of breaking up families, but their mission has been 
misunderstood. Overzealous officials may sometimes 
consider only the interests of the child and overlook the 
‘possible danger to the family as an institution. The child 
should not be removed unless he will gain more than he 
loses by the transaction, but in addition the effect of the 
act upon society itself must not be dropped from consid- 
eration. The parent is also a factor, and can not be lightly 
thrown aside. Many parents, however, are unfit, and 
their children can only be saved by removing them and 
placing them under new and more congenial surroundings. 
The following quotation from Mr. Carsten’s statement 
of the society’s functions represents a progressive but 
safe attitude toward the subject.! “A society for the 
prevention of cruelty to children should be equipped so 
that it may deal promptly with all flagrant instances of 
cruelty and neglect, and in codperation with other agencies 
carry out the community’s purposes. It should be ready 
to assume leadership in urging legislation or in organizing 
community action to protect children from abuses that 
exist or are likely to arise. It should engage in an organ- 
ized way to make a community increasingly sensitive to 
forms of abuse that exist but whose evil results have not 
yet been appreciated.” Here we find not only emphasis 
on remedial work, but also upon methods which if properly

328 CHILD PROBLEMS 
instituted and carried out will prevent much of the abuse 
from which children are suffering at the present time. 
b. Work of Typical Societies. 
Cruelty cases often develop into destitution cases, but as 
these societies are not relief agencies, and should not be, 
effective work requires their codperation with other agencies 
which will care for the children rescued from their neglected 
condition. Accordingly such methods of codperation 
should be instituted as will hasten the disposition of the 
child in question. Institutions and home-finding societies 
are the chief child-caring agencies to which the cruelty 
societies may turn. In Massachusetts the Children’s Aid 
Society and the state board of charity are especially used’ 
for this purpose, and the Catholic charities take care of some 
of the children. In Philadelphia the formation of the 
children’s bureau simplifies the work, and the placing-out 
agency takes the children turned over to it from the cruelty 
society and disposes of them according to its regular meth- 
ods. In New York City the great majority of destitute 
children are transferred to the overabundant institutions 
of the city. Catholic, Protestant, and Hebrew institutions 
are the chief recipients. Nonsectarian institutions re- 
ceive comparatively few children. In other cities and 
states one or more of the above mentioned methods are in 
operation. 
The amount of work accomplished by the New York 
society is astonishing. During 1906-1907, 9902 children 
were placed in homes or institutions; 10,371 cases affect- 
ing children were prosecuted, and 8456 convictions pro- 
cured ; 916 lost children were recovered ; a large number 
of the theaters were investigated in regard to the employ- 
ment of children upon the stage; and more than 1000 
baby farm applications were considered. It also collected 
from delinquent parents upward of $40,000, which was 
paid into the city treasury. A large percentage of the

prosecution cases were offenses against children. Con- 
victions were procured for such offenses as selling liquor 
to children, selling firearms, buying junk, enticement into 
or exposure to immoral surroundings, keeping gambling 
devices for the use of children, assault, cruelty, and neg- 
lect. A considerable proportion of the work of the society, 
however, was in connection with the delinquent child in 
the juvenile court, and therefore no comparisons can be 
made with the work of other societies which confine their 
labors to the neglected and ill-treated child. 
In 1908 the Massachusetts society investigated cases 
involving 6180 different children, of which 1966 were 
brought into court, and 262 children were cared for in the 
society’s home during the year. As the average period 
of detention was only 17 days, most of these children were 
speedily placed in homes and institutions under proper 
care. These societies codperate so closely with the courts 
that they are virtually semi-governmental bodies and not 
mere private philanthropies. One of their greatest needs is 
close codperation with other charitable agencies as well as 
with the courts. Heretofore they have been handicapped 
by not being prepared to dispose of children taken by them 
from bad family conditions. Placing out is a function of 
the home-finding societies, but the absence of sufficient co- 
operation has thrown the anti-cruelty societies on their 
own resources. In New York an immense institutional 
population has been maintained by this unfortunate feeder. 
It has been easier to place children in the hands of an in- 
stitution, and therefore codperation with placing-out so- 
cieties has been far from adequate. In the future such 
codperation will increase, and the institution will gain but 
little from the work of societies for the prevention of cruelty 
to children. The abandonment of relief work will enable 
these societies to insist more effectively on preventive 
work.

2. Tue Instrrution.! 
The institution still plays a very important part among 
the philanthropic agencies of the country. In spite of the 
objections of social workers, it persists in its work, and 
nearly two thirds of all dependent children are under its 
control. Orphanages and children’s homes form about one 
fourth of all the benevolent institutions in the United 
States. There are more than 1000 of these homes, 956 
of which are under the control of private or ecclesiastical 
bodies, and only 119 are directly controlled by the pub- 
lic.? The population of the public institutions is only 
about one tenth that of the orphanages. In 1904 the 
ecclesiastical homes contained 52,000 of the 92,000 chil- 
dren in homes, while other private institutions held 30,000. 
During this year, 32,199 children were received in the 
private institutions, and 31,448 in those under ecclesiastical 
control. Although receiving a smaller number of children, 
the denominational institutions contain a much larger 
aggregate of inmates, thus indicating that they do not 
allow their children to pass through their institutions so 
rapidly as do the private homes. Owing to the various 
methods of handling dependent children, the different states 
vary widely in their proportion of institutions as well as 
of inmates. Where placing-out systems are well estab- 
lished, the percentage of children in orphanages has been 
greatly reduced. 
‘a. Disadvantages of the Institution. 
Qne of the important disadvantages of the institution 
is the slow movement of its population into individual 
homes. Unless an efficient placing-out bureau is main- 
1 Although the institution still plays a large part in the work of child-, 
saving, the principles and methods involved in institutional care are 
so well known by philanthropic and even by lay workers, that nothing 
more than a brief discussion of the subject is necessary.

SOC 
METHODS OF CHILD SAVING. PRIVATE 331 
tained or some central agency can be utilized, the orphan- 
age will fail to place its children in family homes or will 
delay this important duty. Many institutions have utterly 
failed to develop a satisfactory plan of home finding for 
their inmates. Some of them are proud of the large num- 
ber of children for which they are caring. Instead, they 
should feel pride in their ability to find private homes for 
their inmates. To the uncritical eye, more seems to be 
accomplished if children can be seen swarming all over 
the institution. The happy child in the country home is 
not present to impress the visitor at the orphanage. So 
there is often the disinclination to part with the children. 
Another disadvantage of the institution is the type of 
building, and its usual location. The cottage system has 
not commonly superseded the old institutional form of 
building, which is usually located in the city itself or in the 
immediate outskirts where sufficient room and the most 
congenial surroundings are not available. Another pos- 
sible danger lies in the difficulty of properly classifying 
and segregating children of various types and dispositions. 
Within a single institution we frequently find mental 
defectives, backward children, delinquents, dependents, 
and neglected or ill-treated children. Contamination of 
the moral children by those displaying immoral tendencies 
can hardly be avoided except by the strictest possible 
classification. 
Individualization is not possible in institutions, and one 
of the most important needs of the child is therefore neg- 
lected. . In the home the child is ‘“‘mothered,’’ and enjoys 
a spontaneity and freedom from irksome discipline which 
develops his self-reliance and ability to do independent 
work. He comes in contact with the world, and by learning 
its methods adapts himself to its conditions. The child 
in the institution leads an artificial life under artificial 
conditions, and his ‘“‘hothouse’’ development does not pre- 
 
-P-A-G-E-338
ee 
332 CHILD PROBLEMS 
pare for the environment into which he passes after he 
leaves the institution. He finds himself quite helpless, 
and the problems of life overtax him. He does not under- 
stand the struggles of the world, and is frequently sub- 
merged. His education is often less efficient than that 
provided for the normal boy, and his play and recreational 
facilities are so limited that he fails utterly to gain the 
freedom and pleasure enjoyed by the child in the home. 
Many social workers of to-day declare that unless a home 
is very bad, it is better for the child than a good institution. 
Furthermore, many institutions do not reach the level of 
the best standards, and the effect on the child is injurious. 
Children are in many instances still marched to schools 
in squads and returned in similar manner. Besides, in 
many places even the wisdom of sending them to the pub- 
lic schools has not yet been recognized. However, an ex- 
ception must be made in favor of some institutions, espe- 
cially many Hebrew orphanages which now grant complete 
freedom to children going to and coming from school. 
Kindergarten instruction and manual training of superior 
value have also been added to the curricula of many or- 
phanages. Through summer outings and excursions, re- 
freshing nature is temporarily substituted for the prosaic 
surroundings of the institution. These encouraging fea- 
tures can not, however, remove the inherent disadvantages 
of institutional life. 
b. Advantages. 
As indicated in a preceding chapter, a most appropriate 
function of the institution is its use as a home or school 
for defective children and those who are crippled, deformed, 
incurably diseased, or otherwise so afflicted that either 
custodial care or prolonged treatment is necessary. Such 
children can be more successfully handled and trained 
in an institution than in any other way. A second value 
consists of the opportunity for temporary shelter for the 
 
-P-A-G-E-339

METHODS OF CHILD SAVING. PRIVATE 333 
child pending a search for a suitable home. In spite of 
the effort to place children out directly, few agencies are 
able to dispense entirely with some form of institution. 
Again, children in need of temporary care can often find 
no other accommodations than those afforded by an insti- 
tution. The discipline, regularity, and decorum enforced 
in well-established children’s homes often prepares the 
untaught child for family life. The child who has lived 
in a bad home under improper training has invariably 
developed irregular and irresponsible habits. For such 
habits the unrelaxing routine of institutional life is the 
best treatment. Without this discipline, it is doubtful 
if such children would ever become law-abiding citizens. 
8. Founpiina AsYLuMs. 
Homes for foundlings and illegitimate children must be 
provided to save the helpless infants that are picked up on 
the streets, or the children born in shame and dependent 
on an unmarried mother. Institutions of this kind should 
be small, and care for a limited number of babies. Other- 
wise an enormous death rate will prevail. The mortality 
of illegitimate children is almost double that of lawful 
children. Inanition, malnutrition, premature birth, and 
physical defects are the principal causes. Many abnormal 
, children are also found among this group. It is also true 
that lack of adequate care is often responsible for the 
heavy death rate. The illegitimate does not always receive 
sufficient attention, because institutions are commonly too 
large to provide the child with individual care. The neces- 
sary death rate need be but little larger than that of legiti- 
mate infants. Improved methods of care either in small 
homes or in private families will materially reduce the 
mortality. 
Coéperation with municipal authorities is usually neces- 
sary for successful work. Frequently these asylums are

denominational, hence the police and city officials in the 
large cities must apportion the children among the various 
institutions ministering to this need. Relations with some 
of the maternity hospitals must also be established | Wher- 
ever possible the infants should be placed out under the 
care of kind mothers who will keep them under close super- 
vision. The methods of disposition should be so arranged 
as to obtain if possible the following results: first, the full 
responsibility of both parents of the child ; second, the care 
of the child by its parents; third, a deterring influence on 
society and the lessening of the percentage of abandon- 
ment and illegitimacy. 
4. CoNncLUSION. 
The work of private child-caring agencies thus appears 
to cover every branch of child saving. Home-finding 
and aid societies care for dependent children within or 
without their homes, and often pay attention to the neg- 
lected child. More than one third of all children removed 
from homes are thus cared for. The anti-cruelty societies 
care for neglected and ill-treated cases, and cover most of 
the work done in the United States in this respect. The 
institutions, in spite of their defects, are caring for the bulk 
of dependent children, and minister to the needy of every 
class. Other agencies frequently give temporary aid. 
Charity organization societies, settlements, churches, clubs, 
etc., often assist in the care of children; day nurseries 
handle small children during daylight hours; summer 
outing machinery is provided in various ways and operates 
to give fresh air and enjoyment to the poor as well as to 
the dependent children. The variety of work now uuder- 
taken is extensive and most hopeful for the future.

  CHAPTER V 
CHILD-SAVING AGENCIES. PUBLIC. 
Ow1ne to the peculiar development of American philan- 
thropy, public agencies for the care of dependent and neg- 
lected children have taken several forms. Among these 
are: the State School System, State Placing-out System, 
County Home Plan, and the system of Public Subsidies to 
Private Institutions. Local methods of work in the indi- 
vidual states have naturally determined the evolution of 
systems along particular lines, and a variety of methods 
of child saving have therefore arisen. 
1. Tue State Scuoon System. 
The most common method of public care is the state 
school system. It has been adopted in whole or in part by 
eleven states — Michigan, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Rhode 
Island, Kansas, Iowa, Nebraska, Montana, Texas, Colo- 
rado, and Nevada. In a number of states the function of 
the homes for soldiers’ and sailors’ orphans has been ex- 
panded to include the duties of a state school. In Iowa, 
for example, children may be sent as county wards to the 
school and are partially supported by state funds, but these 
children are distinguished from those for whom the in- 
stitution was originally built. The first state to adopt 
the system was Michigan, in 1874. At that time at least 
600 children were scattered about in the almshouses of 
that state, and a radical departure in method was necessary 
to save them from pauperism. Accordingly the state 
school was established, and dependent children between the 
: 335 
 
-P-A-G-E-342
nen 
336 CHILD PROBLEMS 
ages of four and fourteen years were admitted. Subse- 
quent revisions of the law established new age limits. At 
present children from one to twelve years of age are spe- 
cially cared for, but under certain conditions any child under 
fourteen years of age will be received. A babies’ cottage 
has been provided to meet the needs of infants. 
a. Essential Elements of the State School System. 
The essential elements of the state school system, as 
exemplified by Michigan, are the following : the investiga- 
tion of cases considered for the state school, the transferal 
by the courts of the children to the school, the temporary 
detention and maintenance of the children in the insti- 
tution, training and school work during the stay of the 
child, a state placing-out system, the speedy placing of 
children in private homes, and the subsequent supervision 
of the child in these homes. A dependent child is sent to 
the school only after a petition has been filed in the pro- 
bate court of the county in which the child resides, and 
the petition must be signed by at least two of the super- 
intendents of the poor in the said county. The court 
orders an investigation of the causes of dependency, the 
condition of the parents, the child’s former maintenance, 
etc., before making an appropriate disposition of the case. 
Ample precautions are thus taken to prevent the sending 
of unworthy children to the school. When the child is 
made a public ward, the State Board of Control becomes 
his legal guardian and parents or relatives sever their direct 
control. 
The school is essentially a temporary home. It com- 
prises nine cottages, and accommodations are provided for 
250 children. At no time has it been the purpose of the 
managers or superintendents to detain children longer than 
necessary. The training given is intended to fit them 
for life in the family so that they may inspire the affection 
which is necessary to promote the possibility of their adop- 
 
-P-A-G-E-343
    CHILD-SAVING AGENCIES. PUBLIC. 337 
tion. The actual average length of residence of children 
in the school is three and one tenth months. They receive 
good medical service, and during their brief stay are given 
instruction in the common branches, manual training, and 
domestic science. As the children are quite young, the 
greater portion of the work consists of kindergarten and 
primary instruction. A garden and a farm of 160 acres offer 
some opportunities for the older children. 
The Minnesota school, although very efficient, holds 
children received for the first time an average length of 
about five and five tenths months, but including those 
who are returned and placed again, the length of stay is 
thirteen months. In Iowa, where the law prevents facility 
in handling the cases, soldiers’ children actually remain an 
average of a little over four years. The county wards, 
on the other hand, remain only two years and eleven 
months. 
The most successful work for dependent children is done 
for those who are comparatively young. Because children 
form many bad habits under the abnormal conditions 
among which they are almost invariably found, it is neces- 
sary to place them out atthe earliest possible age, so that 
their habits may be re-formed in the new home. In the 
Michigan state school the average age of the children is less 
than seven years, but in Minnesota it is eight and four 
tenths years. In Iowa, with its bunglesome state law, the 
age of the soldiers’ children is ten and of the county chil- 
dren nine and one tenth years; but within two years the 
general average has been reduced about one and one half 
years. Through efficiency in placing out its children, and 
through the policy of temporary maintenance only, the 
state of Michigan reduces the average age of the inmates 
of its school, and also shortens the period of deten- 
tion. The possibilities of this system are thereby demon- 
strated.

338 CHILD PROBLEMS 
b. Placing Out. 
In Michigan the placing out machinery consists of the 
state agent and numerous county agents. When appli- 
cations for children are first received, the county agent in- 
vestigates the merits of the applicants. Some counties, 
however, have no such official, and the state agent is there- 
fore required to make the preliminary investigations. In 
case of press of work this imposes a hardship upon the state 
agent, but the difficulty could be avoided by increasing 
the force of investigators. On approval of the home by 
the agent, the guardian signs a written agreement to care 
for the child according to the requirements demanded by 
the board of control. The child is then placed in the new 
home, where he is supervised. Among the official visitors 
are: the county and state agents, judges of probate, and 
superintendents of the poor. The placing-out methods 
are very similar to those of the best private societies, and 
so need no further discussion. 
c. Results of System. 
Without doubt the state school system has been very 
successful. It is true that a number of children must be 
placed a second, and some a third, time, or even oftener, 
as is the case with private societies, but on the whole splen- 
did results have been achieved. Minnesota enjoys an 
excellent record, and in Michigan 64 per cent of the chil- 
dren are placed but once, while the remainder are returned 
and indentured again. In the latter state only 3 per cent of 
the cases have resulted in failure. The remainder have 
made fair or good progress. During the years 1874-1908, 
6266 children were received by the Michigan school, and 
disposed of in various ways. Twelve per cent of the num- 
ber Were adopted, nearly 10 per cent were returned to 
parents, 30 per cent have become self-supporting, many 
were returned to the counties, and a large percentage are 
still wards of the school. Of this aggregate of children, 
 
-P-A-G-E-345
PE ne ee 
CHILD-SAVING AGENCIES. PUBLIC. 339 
one half had both parents living, 37 per cent were half 
orphans, six per cent were orphans, and the parental con- 
dition of the remainder was unknown. The great bane of 
these children seems to have been worthless parents. A 
large proportion of adoptions is impossible in the case of 
children who have one or both parents living, because 
prospective foster parents hesitate to take them for adop- 
tion and the state naturally hopes that parents will even- 
tually resume their rightful obligations once more. 
The adoption of the state school system naturally results 
in state interest in the work of private child-caring societies, 
and paves the way for state supervision of such work. It 
likewise raises the standard of admission to private in- 
stitutions and tends to place it on a par with that of the 
state school. A greater uniformity in the care of depend- 
ent children is thus secured. On the whole the state 
school system has greatly increased the efficiency of the 
work done for dependent children in those states in which it 
has been adopted. The political difficulties have not been 
formidable. The use of the state school by private agencies 
at first antagonistic to its methods and purposes has in- 
creased, better standards have been set for all, and a large 
| number of children are now being adequately cared for. 
The proportion of dependent children has, on the other 
. hand, declined under the operation of the system. 
2. BoaRDING AND Puacine-our SysTeMs. 
a. Child Saving in New Jersey. 
In New Jersey the State Board of Children’s Guardians 
cares for dependent and neglected children and is em- 
powered to place such children in private homes within 
the state with or without the payment of board. In actual 
practice more than one half of the 737 children in the care 
of the state board in 1908 were living in free homes. Such 
children receive board, clothes, and the privilege of attend-
-P-A-G-E-346
eR 
340 CHILD PROBLEMS 
ing school. Children are placed for adoption, and in such 
cases the prospective parents pay the expenses involved. 
A trial of six months is necessary before the Orphans’ 
Court and state board will consent to adoption papers. 
The children who are boarded are maintained at a rate 
of $1.50 per week, in addition to the cost of clothing and 
medical attendance. Children over ten years of age are 
seldom placed at board, but enter free homes. 
New Jersey has no central institution to which children 
are sent pending their transferal to private homes. The 
children are taken directly from their previous homes, 
from county poorhouses, from charitable institutions, or 
from temporary care in some private denominational in- 
stitution to the homes that have been secured for them. 
The system requires close codperation between the eccle- 
siastical institutions and the state board of children’s 
guardians. The usual placing-out machinery is provided, 
and all wards must be visited quarterly. 
b. Methods in the District of Columbia. 
A very interesting form of work is carried on by the 
Board of Children’s Guardians of the District of Columbia. 
The board consists of nine members, and handles found- 
lings and destitute, delinquent, and feeble-minded cases. 
Children may be placed in free homes or at board in either 
homes or institutions. Ten dollars per month is paid 
for children boarded out. The smaller children are usually 
placed in homes and the older ones in institutions, but the 
majority of all children are located in homes. They may 
be indentured, apprenticed, or placed on trial for adoption, 
and children may be controlled until their majority. Many 
of the institutions utilized are in other states. 
c. The Massachusetts Board of Charity. 
Massachusetts has assumed extensive control of the 
children within its borders. In 1908 the state board of 
charity had in its custody 3779 dependent, neglected,
-P-A-G-E-347
EE Ee 
CHILD-SAVING AGENCIES. PUBLIC. 341 
and delinquent children. More than 2000 of these were 
adjudged neglected.!. The children were cared for in the 
following manner: 1210 were in families without board, 
2316 in families with board, and 253 were in hospitals or 
institutions, receiving special care. The children are all 
treated in the same way, except that some of them are tem- 
porarily placed in homes maintained by the board, for the 
purpose of giving such training and physical care as will 
prepare them for private homes. Infants are placed in fam- 
ily homes after careful investigation by the board. The 
compensation allowed is $2.75 per week, and material for 
clothing is also given. As the age of the child increases, 
the rate paid for board is decreased. Infants are regularly 
and frequently visited by the medical investigators of the 
board. Before they are placed out, most of the babies are 
held at a temporary boarding place where their medical 
needs receive careful attention. Licenses to maintain 
boarding houses for infants are granted by the board, and 
in this way a measure of control is exercised over many 
agencies supporting infants. The great majority of chil- 
dren are placed out directly. Boys are usually sent to 
country homes, but girls are generally retained in or about 
the towns. When children have reached the age of twelve, 
free homes are secured for them. 
The Massachusetts plan represents a striking advance 
in child saving. The board has supervision of the children 
in a number of industrial and truant schools and of more 
than 1000 children supported by the towns and cities. 
More than 7000 children are under its care or supervision. 
Among the valuable features of the system are : — 
(1) Supervision of the great majority of dependent, neg- 
lected, and delinquent children of the state. 
(2) The policy of placing out children, including delin- 
quents.

itable corporations. 
8. Tue County Home System. 
The establishment of county homes for dependent chil- 
dren has had a somewhat unsuccessful history in Indiana 
and Ohio. In 1906 Indiana had forty such homes and 
Ohio had forty-nine. These homes are controlled by a 
local board and supported by the counties. Children are 
not supposed to remain in the almshouses, and properly 
belong to the homes, although in some cases they are placed 
in private institutions. Sometimes the almshouse and 
children’s home are controlled by the same management. 
Some counties are not provided with homes, but send their 
children to homes in the adjoining counties, and in one 
county the children are boarded out. The homes are 
usually small, and something approaching family life is 
often realized, but the management is frequently inefli- 
cient owing to the limited area from which available super- 
intendents can be secured. The system tends to create a 
large institutional population, and does not foster good 
placing-out facilities. Furthermore, the children remain 
too long under institutional care. The Indiana system 
is now supplemented by a state placing-out agency, and 
state supervision of the county homes.! 
4. Pusuic Sussipy System. 
Public subsidies to private child-caring institutions are 
granted in a number of states. New York, however, has 
proceeded farther in this direction than any other state. 
Here children are placed in private institutions, and a sub-

dren, p. 110.

sidy is paid by the town, city, or county responsible for the 
children. In its cruder form, the system encourages a 
tremendous institutional population, as is evident from the 
disproportionate number of children in the institutions sub- 
sidized in New York, California, and the District of Colum- 
bia. State inspection of private institutions and regula- 
tions by the state board of charities tend to lessen the evils 
of this system. The homes for children usually contain 
both private and public patients, but the majority belong 
to the latter group. The New York Foundling Hospital 
cares for nearly 4000 children per year, nearly all of whom 
are supported by the public. Nine tenths of the 2500 
children passing annually through the Catholic Protec- 
tory are public cases. Many of these institutions formerly 
cared for delinquent as well as dependent and neglected 
children, but the rules of the board of charities now re- 
quire an institution to limit its care to one of these two 
general classes. Absolute compliance to these rules has, 
however, not yet been secured. 
Private institutions probably operate somewhat cheaper 
than do those directly maintained by the public. The 
daily per capita cost in representative homes in New York 
City varies from $.23 to about $1, the latter figure apply- 
ing to one of the infant asylums. The large institutional 
population of the states employing this system indicates 
‘that the plan tends to lessen the responsibility of parents 
and also to cause the states to become neglectful of their 
full duties. 
5. Pusiic Carz or Crureuty Casgs. 
Societies for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children are 
private organizations, although they usually rise to the 
dignity of semi-public agencies. Indiana is the only state 
which directly provides public machinery for the care of 
cruelty cases. There the law provides for boards of chil- 
 
-P-A-G-E-350
a LE 
344 CHILD PROBLEMS 
dren’s guardians which may be formed in each county. 
These boards consist of six persons, half of whom must be 
women. The board files petitions for the custody of such 
children as need their intervention, and the court transfers 
the children to the guardianship of the board. Meanwhile | 
the children remain with their parents, except in urgent | 
cases, when they may be taken away. The boards are 
usually conservative and few cases are lost to them in court. 
They have become a valuable deterrent of cruelty, and 
have been able to settle many cases without recourse to 
legal process. The disposition of children is made in 
accordance with one of three possible methods: first, 
they may be taken to board’s homes; second, in the ab- | 
| sence of board’s homes they may be committed to an 
orphan asylum ; third, they may be indentured or adopted. 
In most cases the institutional life of the child is short, and 
they find places in individual homes. A recent law pro- 
viding for the punishment of the parents or guardians 
of neglected children increases the power of the boards. j 
The system has had marked success in Indiana, but so far / 
has not been copied in any other state. 
6. Tue Fourure or State Systems. 
State systems of caring for neglected and dependent | 
children are gradually encroaching upon the domain of | 
private philanthropy. Society is rapidly recognizing the 
duty of the state to these children, and will soon demand 
the rigid performance of this duty. The problem which 
will present itself with increasing force is the selection by 
different states of the system best qualified to meet their 
needs. The growth of state care will gradually lessen the 
importance of private and ecclesiastical institutions. 
At present the majority of states have no organized pub- 
lic care for dependent and neglected children. The state 
school system and the method of direct placing out through 
 
-P-A-G-E-351
LOE ME OT na te Ptr ee RE ST eee era 
CHILD-SAVING AGENCIES. PUBLIC. 845 
a state board differ but little from each other. Both em- 
phasize the placing out of children, but the latter method 
relies somewhat on the temporary use of private institu- 
tions. The states now without a public system will even- 
| tually choose one of these two methods of caring for their 
dependent children. The county homes will gradually 
disappear, and unless the present defects of the subsidy 
system can be removed, it will in turn be replaced by one 
of the two state systems.

CONCLUSION 
Ir is at once evident that we are not yet acquainted with 
the volume of fundamental facts necessary to the formation 
of permanent preventive methods, and that many of the 
simplest analyses are still wanting. Unless methods of 
prevention are based on correct principles the social pro- 
gram can not be logical: or consistent. ~A successful solu- 
tion of the problems of children depends on more social 
research. The establishment of a federal children’s bu- 
reau would be a magnificent step in advance. Such a 
bureau could investigate minutely the causes and pre- 
ventability of infant and child mortality; it could ob- 
serve the results of specific social conditions ; it could study 
the problem of the school child, why he leaves school, and 
how education can be made adaptable; and it could in- 
vestigate many other new questions connected with the 
physical and educational care of the child. The bureau 
should classify all trades in which the employment of chil- 
dren is dangerous, should indicate the remedies for child 
labor, and should suggest a definite program for the lessen- 
ing of the evil. One of the important problems to be 
studied is the moral development of the child; what are 
the formative influences; how do they act; what part is 
played by amusements, play, study, associates, surround- 
ings, and child labor? What are the necessary elements 
in education in sex physiology? What do children know, 
how have they acquired the knowledge, what is the effect, 
what should they know, and how can the requisite knowl- 
edge be best diffused? We need to know where the juve- 
nile offender comes from, whether heredity as an influence 
349 ;
-P-A-G-E-356
ee et ee re ee ee eee Pe 
350 CHILD PROBLEMS 
can be traced, whether the decline of parental authority 
increases delinquency, and how the contributing factors 
operate. The results of probation need more investiga- 
tion, and the relation of juvenile delinquency to crime, 
poverty, pauperism, and mendicancy should be deter- 
mined. We need to know more of the problem of physical 
degeneracy, its nature and its causes; to what extent pre- 
natal conditions affect the growth and vigor of the child ; 
and what are the influences of city life, malnutrition, and 
slum conditions. 
The dependent child needs more attention. The in- 
fluence of orphanages and homes is capable of more exten- 
sive study. These institutions have been condemned on 
a” evidence not wholly conclusive, hence the subsequent 
career of their inmates needs further examination. The 
true outcome of neglect still remains unsolved. The re- 
lation of the environment of youth to the character and 
disposition of the homeless, vagrant, and unemployable 
class would furnish much material for preventive philan- 
thropy. Many other problems could be suggested, but 
the field is so large that only a brief summary of the work 
to be done by a children’s bureau or similar agency can 
here be outlined. 
The spirit of investigation is now so strong that we may 
be very hopeful of the future, and before long we shall be 
possessed of the facts necessary for our purpose. Mean- 
while society must apply itself to these problems with all 
earnestness and determination. Our past history is re- 
plete with mistakes and short-sighted methods of dealing 
with children, and our ideals had not until recently devel- 
oped beyond that of preventive work. Our ignorance of 
the content and meaning of child life has resulted in the 
application of ruinous methods to thousands of children. 
Even to-day many young people are suffering from the 
misguided efforts of untrained men and are deprived of
-P-A-G-E-357
Oe 
CONCLUSION 351 
opportunities for right living. Methods crude, unscien- 
tific, and almost worse than useless have been quite gen- 
erally employed in child saving, yet a humanitarian motive 
has prevailed. Within twenty-five years the viewpoint 
of scientific philanthropy has undergone a complete change. 
Remedial work — although necessary —is now supple- 
mented with preventive methods and constructive work. 
As much as possible philanthropic agencies are enjoined 
to assist in the development of such social reforms as will 
remove the causes of the child problems of to-day. It is 
a long step from the imprisonment of little children to a 
program of wholesome amusement to prevent delinquency, 
or from theignorant treatment of asick infant to the insist- 
ence upon the production of clean milk so as to make 
disease avoidable. 
Reform proceeds gradually, but, with increasing interest 
in social problems, progress becomes rapid and cumulative. 
Accordingly, the next twenty-five years will accomplish 
far more than was attained during the last quarter of a 
century. Public opinion, however, must be thoroughly 
convinced of the need of far-sighted philanthropy, and in 
this respect the reformer still meets with difficulties. That 
careless milking means dying infants is hard to believe ; 
that child labor is harmful is quite incomprehensible to the 
farmer or the employer ; that the best of care in an insti- 
tution may mean total incapacity to sustain the shocks of 
the external world seems incredible to many. The con- 
version of such classes is necessary in order to hasten the 
advent of the needed reforms. Economic interests fre- 
quently oppose progress on selfish grounds. The social 
desirability of a projected reform may be granted, but 
selfish motives create overpowering opposition and the 
reform remains unaccomplished. Good tenement houses 
are needed to prevent disease and contagion; but land- 
lords defeat appropriate legislation. Children should 
 
-P-A-G-E-358
ne 
352 CHILD PROBLEMS 
attend school rather than work, but child labor bills fail. 
Again, individuals are influenced by prejudice, by ancient 
methods, and by immediate considerations, and therefore 
do not comprehend the significance of a constructive pro- 
gram of social betterment. The development in philan- 
thropic method has been so rapid that many have been 
unable to keep pace with the newer movements. These 
and many other difficulties hamper the progress of reform. 
Within the pages of this book an attempt has been made 
to set forth both the fundamental and immediate causes 
— as far as they are known — of the phenomena described. 
The emphasis on causes, it is believed, is justified because 
adequate treatment depends on a satisfactory diagnosis 
of the case. A description and account of conditions has 
been added in order to indicate the magnitude of the 
problems treated. The discussion of methods of ameliora- 
tion and control necessarily requires a large share of atten- 
tion, owing to the prominence of this phase of social reform. 
The work of to-day is important, for upon its foundation 
will be built the more substantial methods of to-morrow. 
Criticism of method is needed to create sentiment in favor 
of the most capable management of existing agencies. 
Finally, the presentation of a constructive program wher- 
ever possible completes the elaboration of each subject. 
This portion of the discussion should be of the greatest 
importance because it considers the problems of the com- 
ing generations who gain or lose according to the degree 
of enlightenment exhibited in the social program of the 
present.

The following Principles were affirmed at the White 
House Conference on Dependent Children held in 1909. 
I. Home Care. 
( Home life is the highest and finest product of civilization.) 
It is the great molding force of mind and character. 
Children should not be deprived of it except for urgent and 
compelling reasons. Children of parents of worthy char- 
acter, suffering from temporary misfortune, and children 
of reasonably efficient and deserving mothers who are 
without the support of the normal bread winner should, 
as a rule, be kept with their parents, such aid being given 
as may be necessary to maintain suitable homes for the 
rearing of the children. This aid should be given by such 
methods and from such sources as may be determined by 
the general relief policy of each community, preferably 
in the form of private charity, rather than of public relief. 
Except in unusual circumstances, the home should not 
be broken up for reasons of poverty, but only for con- 
siderations of inefficiency or immorality. 
II. Preventive Work. 
The most important and valuable philanthropic work 
is not the curative, but the preventive; to check depen- 
dency by a thorough study of its causes and by effectively 
remedying or eradicating them, should be the constant aim 
of society. Along these lines we urge upon all friends 
of children the promotion of effective measures including 
legislation: to prevent blindness; to check tuberculosis 
and other diseases in dwellings and work places, and in- 
355  
-P-A-G-E-362
a 
356 CHILD PROBLEMS 
juries in hazardous occupations; to secure compensation 
or insurance so as to provide a family income in case of 
sickness, accident, death, or invalidism of the breadwinner ; 
to promote child-labor reforms, and, generally, to improve 
the conditions surrounding child-life. To secure these 
ends we urge efficient codperation with all other agencies for 
social betterment. 
III. Home Finpine. 
As to the children who for sufficient reasons must be 
removed from their own homes, or who have no homes, 
it is desirable that, if normal in mind and body, and not 
requiring special training, they should be cared for in fam- 
ilies whenever practicable. The carefully selected foster 
home is for the normal child the best substitute for the 
| natural home. Such homes should be selected by a most 
careful process of investigation, carried on by skilled 
agents, through personal investigation, and with due regard 
to the religious faith of the child. After children are 
placed in homes, adequate visitation, with careful con- 
sideration of the physical, mental, moral, and spiritual 
training and development of each child, on the part of the 
responsible home-finding agency, is essential. 
It is recognized that for many children foster homes 
without payment for board are not practicable immedi- 
ately after the children become dependent, and that for 
children requiring temporary care only the free home is 
not available. For the temporary or more or less per- 
manent care of such children different methods are in 
use, notably the plan of placing them in families, paying 
for their board, and the plan of institutional care. Con- 
tact with family life is preferable for these children, as well 
as for other normal children. It is necessary, however, 
that a large number of carefully selected boarding homes 
be found if these children are to be cared for in families.
-P-A-G-E-363
nen er ee er ee ea 
APPENDIX 357 
The extent to which such families can be found should 
be ascertained by careful inquiry and experiment in each 
locality. Unless and until such homes are found, the use 4 
of institutions is necessary. 
IV. Corrace System. 
So far as it may be found necessary temporarily or per- 
manently to care for certain classes of children in institu- 
tions, these institutions should be conducted on the cottage 
plan, in order that routine and impersonal care may not 
unduly suppress individuality and initiative. The cottage 
unit should not be larger than will permit effective personal 
relations between the adult caretaker or caretakers of each 
cottage and each child therein. Twenty-five is suggested 
as a desirable cottage unit, subject to revision in the light 
of further experience in the management of cottage insti- 
tutions. The cottage plan is probably somewhat more 
expensive, both in construction and in maintenance, than 
the congregate system. It is so, however, only because 
it secures for the children a larger degree of association with 
adults, and a nearer approach to the conditions of family 
life, which are required for the proper molding of childhood. 
These results more than justify the increased outlay, and 
are truly economical. Child-caring agencies, whether 
supported by public or private funds, should by all legiti- 
mate means press for adequate financial support. In- 
ferior methods should never be accepted by reason of lack 
of funds without continuing protest. Cheap care of chil- 
dren is ultimately enormously expensive, and is unworthy 
of a strong community. Existing congregate institutions 
should so classify their inmates and segregate them into 
groups as to secure as many of the benefits of the cottage 
system as possible, and should look forward to the adoption 
of the cottage type when new buildings are constructed. 
The sending of children of any age or class to almshouses
-P-A-G-E-364
ee Pe 358 CHILD PROBLEMS 
is an unqualified evil, and should be forbidden everywhere 
by law, with suitable penalty for its violation. 
V. Incorporation. 
To engage in the work of caring for needy children is to 
assume a most serious responsibility, and should, therefore, 
be permitted only to those who are definitely organized 
for the purpose, who are of suitable character, and possess, 
or have reasonable assurance of securing, the funds needed 
for their support. The only practicable plan of securing 
this end is to require the approval, by a State Board of 
Charities or other body exercising similar powers, of the 
incorporation of all child-caring agencies, including the 
approval of any amendments of the charter of a benevo- 
lent corporation, if it is to include child-caring work; and 
by forbidding other than duly incorporated agencies to 
engage in the care of needy children. 
VI. Stare Inspection. 
The proper training of destitute children being essential 
to the well-being of the state, it is a sound public policy 
that the state, through its duly authorized representative, 
should inspect the work of all agencies which care for de- 
pendent children, whether by institutional or by home- 
finding methods, and whether supported by public or pri- 
vate funds. Such inspection should be made by trained 
agents, should be thorough, and the results thereof should 
be reported to the responsible authorities of the institution 
or agency concerned. The information so secured should 
be confidential, not to be disclosed except by competent 
authority. 
VII. Inspection or Epucationan Work. 
Destitute children at best labor under many disadvan- 
tages, and are deprived in greater or less degree of the 
assistance and guidance which parents afford their own 
 
-P-A-G-E-365
Se EE RT ee Ra Oe a nN nT tee eee 
_ APPENDIX 359 
children. It is important, therefore, that such children 
be given an education which will fit them for self-support 
and for the duties of citizenship, and the state should pro- 
vide therefor. In order that this education may be equal to 
that afforded by the schools attended by the other children 
of the community, it is desirable that the education of 
children in orphan asylums and other similar institutions 
or placed in families should be under the supervision of the 
educational authorities of the state. 
VIII. Facts anp Recorps. 
The proper care of a child in the custody of a child-caring 
agency, as well as the wise decision as to the period of his 
retention and ultimate disposition to be made of him, in- 
volve a knowledge of the character and circumstances of 
his parents, or surviving parent, and near relatives, both 
before and at the time the child becomes dependent, and 
subsequently. One unfortunate feature of child-caring 
work hitherto is the scanty information available as to the 
actual careers of children who have been reared under the 
care of charitable agencies. This applies both to institu- 
tions, which too frequently lose sight of the children soon 
after they leave their doors, and home-finding agencies, 
which too frequently have failed to exercise supervision ade- 
quate to enable them to judge of the real results of their 
work. Itis extremely desirable that, taking all precautions 
to prevent injury or embarrassment to those who have 
been the subjects of charitable care, the agencies which 
have been responsible for the care of children should know 
to what station in life they attain and what sort of citizens 
they become. Only in this manner can they form a cor- 
rect judgment of the results of their efforts. 
We believe, therefore, that every child-caring agency 
should — 
1. Secure full information concerning the character
-P-A-G-E-366
ee eT he Gea 
360 CHILD PROBLEMS 
and circumstances of the parents and near relatives of each 
child in whose behalf application is made, through personal 
investigation by its own representative, unless adequate 
information is supplied by some other reliable agency. 
2. Inform itself by personal investigation at least once 
each year of the circumstances of the parents of children in 
its charge, unless the parents have been legally deprived 
of guardianship, and unless this information is supplied 
by some other responsible agency. 
3. Exercise supervision over children under their care 
until such children are legally adopted, are returned to 
their parents, attain their majority, or are clearly beyond 
the need of further supervision. 
4. Make a permanent record of all information thus 
secured. 
IX. Puystcan Care. 
The physical condition of children who become the 
subjects of charitable care has received inadequate consid- 
eration. Each child received into the care of such an 
agency should be carefully examined by a competent 
physician, especially for the purpose of ascertaining whether 
such peculiarities, if any, as the child presents may be due 
to any defect of the sense organs or to other physical 
defect. Both institutions and placing-out agencies should 
take every precaution to secure proper medical and sur- 
gical care of their children, and should see that suitable in- 
struction is given them in matters of health and hygiene. 
X. Co6PErartion. 
Great benefit can be derived frontile, close codperation be- 
tween the various child-caring agencies, institutional and 
otherwise, in each locality. It is especially desirable that 
harmonious relations be established in regard to the classes 
of children to be received by each agency, the relations of
-P-A-G-E-367
  nn 
APPENDIX 361 
such agencies to the parents of children received, and the 
subsequent oversight of children passing from the custody 
of child-caring agencies. The establishment of a joint 
bureau of investigation and information by all the child- 
caring agencies of each locality is highly commended, in 
the absence of any other suitable central agency through 
which they may codperate. 
XI. Unprsrraste LaEaGisLation. 
We greatly deprecate the tendency of legislation in some 
states to place unnecessary obstacles in the way of placing 
children in family homes in such states by agencies whose 
headquarters are elsewhere, in view of the fact that we 
favor the care of destitute children, normal in mind and 
body, in families, whenever practicable. 
We recognize the right of each state to protect itself 
from vicious, diseased, or defective children from other 
states by the enactment of reasonable protective legisla- 
tion; but experience proves that the reception of healthy 
normal children is not only an act of philanthropy, but 
also secures a valuable increment to the population of 
the community and an ultimate increase of its wealth. 
The people of the more prosperous and less congested 
districts owe a debt of hospitality to the older commu- 
nities from which many of them come. 
We earnestly protest, therefore, against such legislation 
as is prohibitive in form or in effect, and urge that where 
it exists it be repealed. 
XII. Permanent ORGANIZATION. 
The care of dependant children is a subject about which 
nearly every session of the legislature of every state in the 
Union concerns itself ; it is a work in which state and local 
authorities in many states are engaged, and in which 
private agencies are active in every state. Important 
 
-P-A-G-E-368
ee 
362 CHILD PROBLEMS 
decisions are being made constantly by associations and 
public authorities affecting questions of policy, the type of 
buildings to be constructed, the establishment of an ade- 
quate system of investigating homes and visiting children 
placed in homes, and scores of important matters affecting 
the well-being of needy children. Each of these decisions 
should be made with full knowledge of the experience of 
other states and agencies, and of the trend of opinion among 
those most actively engaged in the care of children, and 
able to speak from wide experience and careful observation. 
One effective means of securing this result would be the 
establishment of a permanent organization to undertake, 
in this field, work comparable to that carried on by the 
National Playground Association, the National Associa- 
tion for the Study and Prevention of Tuberculosis, the 
National Child Labor Committee, and other similar or- 
ganizations in their respective fields. It is our judgment 
that the establishment of such a permanent voluntary 
organization, under auspices which would insure a careful 
consideration of all points of view, broad-mindedness and 
tolerance, would be desirable and helpful, if reasonably 
assured of adequate financial support. 
"XII. Feperan Curupren’s Buruav. 
A bill is pending in Congress for the establishment of a 
Federal Children’s Bureau to collect and disseminate in- 
formation affecting the welfare of children. In our judg- 
ment the establishment of such a bureau is desirable, and 
we earnestly recommend the enactment of the pending 
measure. 
XIV. Summary. i 
The preceding suggestions may be almost completely 
summarized in this, — that the particular condition and 
needs of each child should be carefully studied and that he
-P-A-G-E-369
APPENDIX 363 
should receive that care and treatment which his individual 
needs require, and which should be as nearly as possible 
like the life of the other children of the community. 
XV. 
We respectfully recommend that you send to Congress 
a message urging favorable action upon the bill for a Fed- 
eral Children’s Bureau and the enactment of such legis- 
lation as will bring the laws and the public administra- 
tion of the District of Columbia and other federal territory 
into harmony with the principles and conclusions herein 
stated, and we further recommend that you cause tobe 
transmitted to the governor of each state in the Union 
a copy of the proceedings of this conference for the infor- 
mation of the State Board of Charities or other body exer- 
cising similar powers.

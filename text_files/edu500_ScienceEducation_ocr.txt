    PREFACE. 
  
I compty with the request of Mr. and Mrs. Felkin to 
write a preface to their translation of Herbart’s Science of 
Education and The Aisthetic Revelation of the World, not 
because I think that any words of mine can add to the 
value of the book, but because I hope that by advocat- 
ing the scientific training of teachers generally, I may 
do something to create a public ready to welcome this and 
similar enterprises. The training of teachers in schools 
other than elementary, stands in this country in a very 
peculiar position. Nearly fifteen years ago the Commit- 
tee of the Head-Masters’ Conference took the matter in 
hand and requested the Universities of Oxford and Cam- 
bridge to prepare a scheme of lectures and examinations 
for the purpose. Oxford declined to take any steps, but 
Cambridge established lectures and examinations which 
have continued ever since. The result has been different 
from what the projectors of the scheme intended. Very 
few public schoolmasters have submitted themselves to 
training. On the other hand, women have fully availed 
themselves of these opportunities, and there are at present 
five training colleges for women in direct connection with 
the examinations of the Teachers’ Training Syndicate. 
It is difficult indeed to see by what argument the 
absence of training for teachers can be defended. What 
is required for doctors and clergymen would naturally be 
demanded for a profession which undertakes the hygiene

  both of the mind and the body. It is urged by some that 
a university graduate who has been at a public school 
needs no special training, because having had experience 
of many teachers he can tell for himself what should be 
imitated and what avoided. It would be as reasonable 
to assert that an invalid who had passed through the 
hands of many physicians would make an excellent 
doctor. A boy is not a fair critic of a master’s methods. 
He is generally struck to an exaggerated degree by some 
peculiarity which may be a merit or a defect. Indeed, 
the best teaching and the highest form of education are 
imparted in such a way that the pupil is unconscious of 
the process. The greatest merit of the teacher is to 
secure his own effacement. His greatest honour is when 
the pupil thinks that he has learnt everything by his own 
unaided efforts. A young man leaving the University goes 
to teach in a school with the vague recollections of many 
teachers in his mind. Perhaps there are one or two whom 
he extravagantly admires. He will imitate even these 
faults. He is also determined never to show the awkward- 
ness of this man, the simplicity of that, the temper of one, 
and the gullibility of another. Notwithstanding these 
good resolutions, he may when brought face to face with 
a number of boys exhibit them all in turn. The master 
whom I most admired at school used to be very careless 
about the exercises he looked over in form. He used to 
throw them down upon the floor in a disorderly heap. 
When I first became a schoolmaster, I naturally imitated 
the practice, until one day a colleague passed the door of 
my schoolroom and pointed out to me that I was not only 
encouraging habits of untidiness, but that I was giving 
ample opportunity for fraud. After this I carefully col- 
lected my exercises, and took them in a neat packet to 
my house. Indeed, during thirty years of teaching I 
 
-P-A-G-E-9
    Preface. vii 
have scarcely ever heard a lecture or a lesson given by 
others from which I have not learnt something either to 
copy or to avoid. The proper use of the blackboard came 
to me, if indeed I possess it now, from a lecture heard in 
quite recent years. I am certain that acompetent master 
of method could teach nine-tenths of our public school- 
masters devices of teaching which would be of great use 
to them, and could correct many obvious faults. 
It may be objected that training of this kind would 
lead to cold and mechanical uniformity, and undoubtedly 
this might be the case if it were carried to excess, But 
it will be time to guard against this evil when the danger 
appears. At present the balance is all on the other side. 
Training colleges for elementary teachers may have 
turned out teachers of too rigid and uniform a type. But 
the material has been unpromising, and the ordinary 
pupil-teacher has not the versatility and the independence 
of mind which is found in the graduate who aspires to be 
a public schoolmaster. But the trained schoolmaster will 
always have the advantage in certain points. He will 
secure the attention and order of a large class without 
difficulty, and his lessons will be better arranged so as to 
teach a larger amount in a shorter space of time. The 
practical certificate of the Teachers’ Training Syndicate 
is given partly on a report of a competent examiner on 
certain set lessons delivered in his presence. No fair- 
minded public schoolmaster could read the detailed 
criticisms of these lessons furnished by the examiner to 
the Syndicate without admitting that he might have 
profited largely by the exercise of a similar criticism. 
What I have said above refers to the more mechanical 
parts of the practice of teaching, but the same considera- 
tions will apply with equal or greater force to instruction 
in the theory. The theoretical part of the Cambribge
-P-A-G-E-10

viii Preface. 
examination consists of three sections—history, theory, and 
practice. Each of these has its special value in the educa- 
tion of the teacher. A public school teacher, who takes 
an interest in his profession, will be struck by the fact that 
intelligent discussion of methods plays so small a part in 
the conversation of his colleagues. No body of men are 
more devoted to their work, probably no class of profes- 
sional men carry their work so completely into every 
portion of their life. The details of their profession 
engage their minds not only in the school time, but in 
the holidays; they areas urgently present to the members 
of their family as to themselves. Indeed, the family of a 
schoolmaster is often as actively engaged in producing 
the results at which he aims, as the family of a peasant 
proprietor. He does not, like a lawyer or a doctor, or a 
man of business, find repose from his anxieties in a family 
circle whose interests have nothing to do with his avoca- 
tions. The boy is always with him; yet the fundamental 
conditions of his work are often unquestioned. The 
practice of a large school is made up of survivals and 
traditions, good, bad, and indifferent, often lasting far 
beyond the need which called the practice into existence. 
The daily routine demands with pitiless recurrence the 
execution of tasks which we feel to be useless. School- 
masters have not the time and still less the desire to review 
their system periodically so as to bring it mto harmony 
with the needs of the age, or to make a careful apportion- 
ment between effort and result. The answer is too often 
given to a reformer, ‘“‘ Well, well, we must grind on.” A 
narrow and exaggerated sense of duty is frequently the 
bar to a higher excellence. The study of the history of 
education, tends to dispose the teacher to an intelligent 
criticism of methods, or at least to a belief that methods 
are capable of intelligent criticism. He may learn from 
 
-P-A-G-E-11
  Preface. ix 
it two important things: first, the means by which the 
practice of his school has been gradually built up, so 
that he may learn to appreciate what is essential and 
what is accidental; and secondly, the ideals which great 
schoolmasters and thinkers on education have conceived 
as at some time attainable under happier circumstances. 
The student of the Trivium and Quadrivium, of Sturm, of 
the Jesuits, will learn something of the genesis of the 
modern public school, the reader of Comenius, of Milton, 
of Locke, of Rousseau, or Spencer, will have a series of idea's 
at hiscommand which he may call from time to time into 
practical use. Also the ex cathedra teaching of practice is 
not without its advantages. The best means of imparting 
the knowledge of languages, mathematics, history, and 
geography can be taught by lectures. The best disposition 
of a time-table, the most important questions of school 
hygiene, matters so seriously neglected in our public 
schools, can be imparted in the same manner. The great 
oculist, Liebreich, visiting Eton College some twenty years 
ago, discovered that only one class-room in the whole 
school was constructed on principles which he considered 
sound, and the new class-rooms, built at a great expense, 
were in some respects the worst in the place. 
But if these pleas are to be admitted for the study of 
history and practice, surely that of theory is of more urgent 
importance. The main operations of the schoolmaster are 
directed towards the mind of the pupil. How is it possi- 
ble that these operations can be wisely or profitably con- 
ducted unless he knows as much of the growing mind as 
is possible to be known. Hence the study of psychology 
becomes of the very first necessity. There is, of course, 
psychology and psychology. I do not say that the best 
psychologist will prove the best schoolmaster, or that the 
most abstract psychological training is of the greatest use
-P-A-G-E-12

x Preface. 
to a teacher. But the psychology which has reference to 
the simple operations of the mind, and that branch of it 
which rests upon a physical basis, cannot fail to assist the 
schoolmaster materially in many of the most important 
questions which he has to decide. Let us take the case of 
memory. Learning by heart, which occupied so large a place 
in the traditional public school curriculum, was always 
defended on the ground that it strengthened the memory. 
| The assertion of Locke that it did nothing of the kind 
. was unknown or disregarded. Surely psychologists can 
| tell us whether and to what extent learning by heart 
| does strengthen the memory, and what kind of learning 
by heart will strengthen it most. As a boy I was com- 
pelled to learn in a superficial manner large masses of 
prose and poetry, and my memory became so weak under 
the operation that I was dismissed as soon as I had said a 
single line correctly. A friend of mine used to invent 
Homer as he went on like an ancient rhapsodist, and 
always got off with great applause. One boy would learn 
his part of five lines, wait till the passage came round in 
its turn, and go up and say it off. Another would adopt 
the simpler method of pasting a leaf on the desk in front 
of him and reading it off. These subterfuges arose from 
demanding under the pressure of a false theory a task 
which could not be performed under the existing con- 
ditions. Some enlightened schools, I believe, now exact 
the accurate learning of shorter pieces; but does this 
strengthen the memory, or does it only store it witha 
golden treasury of literature? Even more fundamental 
are the questions of pleasure and pain as inducements to 
learning, the best means of commanding attention, the 
relation of the senses to the intellect, the comparative 
merits of the hard and the easy. If these difficulties, 
which meet a schoolmaster at the very threshold of his 
   
-P-A-G-E-13
  Preface. xi 
work, cannot be solved by psychology, they may at least 
be reduced to a form in which they become easier of 
solution. If we cannot reconcile disagreements, we may be 
able to see exactly where the disagreement lies. 
To those who desire to study psychology in relation to 
education few writings will have more value than those 
of Herbart. He was a psychologist of the first rank, the 
founder, some would call him, of modern psychology. He 
was also a practical teacher. Pestalozzi and Froebel were 
to some extent both psychologists and practical teachers, 
but their psychology was vague, and their teaching was 
confined to very young children. Pestalozzi in his hospi- 
tal at Stanz revolutionized the education of our present 
century. But the natures with whom he identified him- 
self, and which he analysed with such loving care, were 
those of little children, waifs and strays, poor homeless 
orphans. Herbart began the study of education and of 
the human mind as a private tutor of boys of gentle 
birth and nurture intended to receive the higher educa- 
tion. His experience, therefore—and in him theory and 
practice always went hand in hand—are of especial value 
to teachers of public schools. His practical counsels apply 
to ourselves. An Eton master is not likely to be in the 
position of teaching the elements of knowledge from an 
old piece of tapestry; heis very likely to be grateful for 
the advice that the Odyssey is the piece of literature 
most suitable for the training of the young. 
The study of the Theory of Education which I have 
endeavoured to advocate, has been greatly hampered in 
England by the want of efficient text-books. In Germany 
and in other countries they are abundant and accessible 
enough ; with us educational theories have too often to 
be learned from summaries or from lectures. Mr. and 
Mrs. Felkin deserve the thanks of all who are inter-

ested in education by making these writings of Her- 
bart accessible to Englishmen. They have accom- 
plished their work with the greatest care and self-denying 
zeal, The translation is as readable as is consistent with 
an exact rendering of the original. If it is carefully 
studied, as it ought to be, there will be no difficulty in 
understanding it. ‘Their introduction is probably the best 
account of Herbart which has appeared in our tongue. I 
venture to hope that their efforts, a labour of love, will be 
appreciated in this country, and that the work which they 
now put forth may be so successful as to induce them or 
others to undertake a similar task, and to remove a re- 
proach which has long rested upon us, that we have no

  TRANSLATORS’ PREFACE. 
Tue translation of Herbart’s chief educational work 
- which is now offered to English and American readers, 
and especially to educationalists of both countries, was 
undertaken with great doubt and diffidence. But the 
need of such a translation was said to be felt, and we 
were induced to begin it by a member of the working 
staff of the Maria Grey Training College for women, Miss 
K. M. Clarke, and to continue it by the late Mr. Quick, 
who much desired that Herbart should be made accessible 
to English teachers, and without whose encouragement 
we should hardly have presumed to proceed. This must 
be our apology for undertaking so difficult a task—one 
we would gladly have left in more able hands. Herbart’s 
style, classical as it is, presents many difficulties to the 
translator. It is one peculiarly his own, characterised by 
great compression of thought, and requiring close atten- 
tion on the part of the reader, in whom Herbart presumes 
a deep interest in the subject of education. A more flow- 
ing English rendering it would have been possible to 
give, but it would have been a paraphrase, not Herbart 
himself, Therefore since accuracy, faithful representa- 
tion, is a translator’s first duty and virtue, we have 
determined to leave the work in its present form, believ- 
ing that those who wish to study it will prefer to do so 
in the more rugged but more correct translation.

xiv Translators Preface. 
Although The sthetic Revelation of the World, having 
been written first, precedes The Science of Education in 
the translation, we recommend the student to read The 
Science of Education before The Aitsthetic Revelation, as 
the latter requires a greater previous knowledge of Her- 
bart’s mode of thought and technology. | 
Our warmest thanks are due to Mr. Oscar Browning, 
Fellow of King’s College, Cambridge, for his valuable 
preface, showing the worth of Herbart’s writings to 
English teachers; we also acknowledge the careful and 
scholarly revision of the translation by Mr. G. W. 
Steevens of Balliol College, Oxford. 
We are indebted to G. A. Hennig’s Life and Study of 
Herbart for much information, and to it and Ziller’s 
Herbartischen Reliquien for most of the biographical 
material. Of these we have made free use, as well as of 
Carl Richter’s and Dr. Otto Willmann’s editions of Her- 
bart’s works, with their rich and suggestive comment- 
aries. The material of the analysis of the Péadagogik, 
given at the close of the Introduction, is taken from 
Richter, and that of the A%sthetic Revelation of the 
World chiefly from Hennig.

  INTRODUCTION BY THE TRANSLATORS. 
HERBART’S LIFE AND EDUCATIONAL WORK. 
One of the greatest living art critics has said, that the real 
strength of an artist is tried to the utmost, and never elsewhere 
brought out so thoroughly, as in painting one man or woman 
and the soul that isin them. Whether the tool of the artist 
be pen or brush, the assertion is equally true; indeed, it per- 
haps applies with greater force if the artist be a writer and not 
a painter, since the simpler materials to produce any effect, 
require greater firmness of touch and accuracy of sight in him 
who uses them. In no sense can the following brief biography 
pretend to offer that perfected portrait of a great man in which 
the interaction of the internal and external forces which build 
up character is made visible. Anything beyond the barest out- 
lines of his personality and the outward details of his life has 
been of necessity omitted; and what are these, ‘if,’ as Car- 
lyle has asked, “its inner secret, the remorse, temptations, true, 
often baffled, never ended struggle of it be forgotten?” The 
story of Herbart’s inner growth and development remains to 
be written. This little sketch is only a humble finger-post by 
the wayside of a noble life, and its purpose will be fulfilled if 
it points the English traveller in the world of thought to what, 
for him, is an almost unknown country of beauty and of good. 
Johann Friedrich Herbart was born at Oldenburg, 
May 4th, 1776. His father, Thomas Gerhard Her- 
bart, a lawyer and privy councillor of that town, seems to have 
conscientiously discharged his professional duties, but to have 
had no desire to extend the narrow range of thought required in 
their daily routine. His mother, on the contrary, Louise Schiitte, 
the daughter of an Oldenburg doctor, is described as “a rare 
and wonderful woman.” Utterly unlike her husband, possess-

ing imagination, strength of will, and considerable intellectual 
power, she was eminently fitted for what to her was a labour 
of love—the direction of her only child’s early education, in 
which she happily combined discipline with affection. The 
boy’s delicacy when a child, the result of a fall into a tub of 
almost boiling water, induced his mother to provide him with 
home instruction. Her choice of his first private tutor, after- 
wards Pastor Ulzen, was a wise one. The aim of all ‘his in- 
struction was to cultivate clearness, definiteness, and continuity __ 
of thought, and the boy’s innate aptitude for philosophy received 
from such teaching a powerful stimulus. The mother, that she 
might watch the tutor’s influence and methods of instruction, 
as well as help her son in any difficulty, was always present at 
. the lessons, learning Greek herself, that she might the more 
perfectly follow the progress of his studies. As a child he 
) showed extraordinary power of understanding and remembering 
the thoughts of others. * He would reproduce sermons heard in 
church almost word for word. His mathematical turn of mind 
was a marked mental characteristic, evident even in his childish 
play, as was also his attraction to physical science. Time was 
found among more serious studies for music, for which he had 
considerable talent. His love for it lasted through life, and we 
are told he would seek relief in it from the arduous labours of 
later years, delighting his friends by his performances. His 
book on harmony, and a sonata of merit, composed in 1808, and 
performed at his Centenary Memorial Festival, prove that music 
was to him a source both of work and recreation. However 
much we may doubt the truth of his generalization, we can 
understand how the following piece of autobiography was 
written in the remembrance of this period of childhood, its 
mental gifts and their favourable environment—“ the whole 
look of a well-trained boy is directed above himself, and when 
eight years old, his entire line of vision is beyond all histories 
of children.”’ } 
Entering the Gymnasium of his native town in his thirteenth 
year, he already possessed that “ many-sided and balanced   
4 Introduction to Allg. Pddagogik, page 89.
-P-A-G-E-23
  Introduction by the Translators. 3 
interest’ which he afterwards defined as “the first part of the 
educational aim.” 
Having begun logic at the age of eleven, and 
metaphysics when twelve, he two years later wrote 
an essay on Human Freedom, concluding with the following 
words, curiously indicative even at this early age of the intel- 
lectual rectitude which throughout life was one of his most 
prominent characteristics—“ It is contrary to all philosophy to 
reject an argument against which we have nothing to urge.” 
At the Gymnasium, where a year after his éiitranee he was 
placed in the prima, his favourite studies were physics and 
philosophy. A farewell oration delivered in Latin in 1794, in 
which he compared Cicero and Kant’s conception of the highest 
good, with the principle of moral philosophy, attracted con- 
siderable attention. As to his social experiences at school, the 
boy’s home education had increased, as was to be expected, his 
natural reserve; and, though he won the regard and even the 
affection of his fellow pupils, he seems to have formed friend- 
ships with only two of his classmates, Bonus and Langreuter. 
During the long half-holiday rambles, which, in the absence of 
any national game like cricket, formed the one great recreation 
then, as now, of German boys, the three friends would enter 
into hot discussions on many subjects, sometimes losing their 
way both in subjects and forests, as when Herbart thought he 
had discovered the secret of perpetual motion, but never fail- 
ing to find the basket of provisions which his good mother would 
send on before them. According to the master’s report, Herbart 
left the Gymnasium, his only school, at the age of eighteen, 
“ distinguished among his schoolfellows for order, good conduct, 
and unceasing industry in developing and improving his excel- 
lent natural abilities.” With a mind at once classically cul- 
tured and thoroughly trained in the processes of logical thought, 
he went at once to Jena to study jurisprudence at his father’s 
wish ; a subject entirely distasteful to himself, and which he 
ultimately threw aside.

  philosophic thought. Karl Rheinhold, the gifted disciple of 
Kant, whose system had superseded that of Wolff, with its utili- 
tarian basis for morality, was succeeded by Fichte, who became 
Professor of Philosophy at the University in 1794, the year of 
Herbart’s entrance. At first the scholar, and later on for a 
time the enthusiastic disciple of Fichte, Herbart formed the 
highest estimate of his teacher’s genius, and ac nowledged the 
extent of the intellectual debt which he owed him. But the 
spirit of enquiry in the young student was too strong to be 
limited, and his acute logic soon convinced him that Fichte’s 
Idealism was no satisfactory theory of the universe. Later he 
wrote: “ Fichte taught me chiefly through his errors, and was 
able to do so, because in all his enquiries he aimed at exact 
thought. With and by means of this aim every teacher of 
philosophy is useful to his scholars; without it, the latter are 
but visionaries and fools.” 
The year 1796 marks the point at which German philosophy 
bifurcates into the streams of Idealism and Realism. MHerbart’s 
criticisms of this date on Schelling, whose philosophy he con- 
sidered the most logical form of Idealism, contained his points 
- of divergence from Fichte, and the leading ideas, easily recog- 
nisable, of his own future system. ‘“‘ However many happy 
thoughts,” he writes, “‘ may be scattered about in Fichte’s deduc- 
tions regarding natural right and morality, I consider the funda- 
mental points, 7.e. his theory of the recognition of a reasoning 
being as such, anc. his doctrine of freedom, as false.” It is sug- 
gestive of the future teacher, that Herbart rejected the idealistic 
doctrine of freedom at this early stage of his mental develop- 
ment, on the ground of its inconsistency with the possibility of 
education. In the letter before referred to, he writes: “I am 
very modest in my demands on human freedom. Leaving that 
to Schelling and to Fichte, I seek to determine a human being 
by the laws of his reason and nature, and to give him that 
which will enable him to make something of himself.” 
Having thus parted from his teacher, he started on his own 
independent line of thought, often passing weeks together in 
the consideration of philosophical problems, to the exclusion of 
all other study, and rarely attending the university lectures.

  In thus thinking out his subject for himself, and then discuss- 
ing it with a few chosen friends, he acquired that firm mastery 
over his material, which characterised from this time both his 
written and oral productions. To this period of his life belongs 
also that study of the Homeric poems, upon which was founded 
the opinion to which he always afterwards adhered, and the 
practical worth of which he himself successfully proved, when 
teacher, that since the poems contain “the best classical repre- 
sentations of an ideal boyhood,” the reading of them should 
form the beginning of education. 
Herbart’s mother, attracted by the University society which 
her mental capacity so well fitted her to enter, and glad to 
leave the uncongenial husband (from whom she was afterwards 
divorced) for her son’s society, lived in Jena during the latter’s 
residence there, associating with its professors, especially with 
Fichte, Niethammer, and the historian Woltmann, and using 
her personal acquaintance with Schiller to bring about a friend- 
ship between her son and the poet, traces of which may be - 
found in Herbart’s writings. Once more she was to exercise a 
beneficial influence on her son’s future, by directing his strong 
interest in education, latent only up to this time, into its first 
channel of practical activity, from whence it was to pass into, 
and mark out the much-loved work of his life. ¥ Acting on her 
suggestion and advice, he left the University early in 1797, 
before his course was completed, to become private tutor to the 
three sons of Herr von Steiger-Reggisberg, the governor of 
Interlaken. In later years, the happy relation hitherto existing 
between the mother and son became somewhat clouded. Be- 
lieving that from the study of philosophy, to which he after- 
wards returned, he would obtain but poor provision for the 
practical needs of life, she ceased to enter into his projects 
with the old approval and sympathy. He, on his part, seems 
to have retained his early affection for her unbroken, and we 
gain a glimpse of his strong loving nature from a letter written 
to his friend Schmidt in 1799, when his mother’s illness, com- 
bined with other circumstances, induced him to resign his post 
as tutor. “I think I could have surrounded my garden (his 
pupils) with a fairly impenetrable hedge, did not my sick

  mother’s wishes call me away. I have begged her not to hide 
them from me, and you will wish me compensation in the joy 
of an attempt to lighten her sufferings. My good, my perpetual 
benefactress! how much that was undreamed of, perhaps un- 
avoidable, has she had to suffer for my sake! How gladly 
would I repay her, were it in any way possible! ”

vate Tutor. what of patience, perseverance, faithfulness, of me- 
thod, insight, ingenuity, energy; in a word, whatsoever of 
strength the man had in him, will lie written in the Work he 
does.” Difficult indeed would it be to find a fairer record of 
head and heart, than that contained in the work of Herbart. 
He went, as he writes, into his “new world of hopes, wishes, 
cares and plans, with the earnest purpose of deserving the hap- 
piness it offered” him. The condition of his pupils and his 
general environment are best learned from his own words in a 
letter to his friend Rist. “ The piece of land given me to till has 
not been neglected by nature, though it has lain fallow terribly 
long, has become hard and stiff, and must be thoroughly dug 
over before anything can be sown init. . . . Friendly faces 
and helpful hands wherever help is possible, consideration and 
courtesy, and above all things complete freedom in the arrange- 
ment of work, combined with the greatest interest in the resalt 
—all these I wanted and have found in the house of Landvogt 
Steiger. . . . The man is man, the woman, woman, and the 
children, children ; they are all actually what they seem, and so 
at least satisfy the requirements of truth, if not exactly of 
beauty. . . . Steiger is conscientiousness and punctuality itself, 
and yet no pedant; he is almost without prejudices, and recep- 
tive to all for which a reason can be shown. He can be at 
times cheerful, merry ; under his rule the household lives in 
quiet regularity, the wife in her unvarying gentleness, goodness 
and charity, the children in their joyousness. The house is no 
temple of genius, but the abode of healthy common sense.” 
Herr von Steiger, probably seeing the rare ability of their 
teacher, left the education of his three sons, Ludwig, Karl, and 
1 Past and Present, by Thos. Carlyle, book 3, ch. v.

Rudolf, aged respectively fourteen, ten, and eight years, en- 
tirely in his hands, the sole condition being that Herbart should 
report its plan and progress to him in a letter every two months. 
Five only of the twenty-four letters were preserved, but these 
contain the outlines of an unusual course of education carefully 
planned, strictly based on psychology, and therefore adapted 
with rare educational insight to the individualities and different 
ages of the three boys. Being concerned in this place with 
the man rather than the teacher, we only remark in passing, 
that these letters, written at the age of twenty-one, contain 
many of the fundamental ideas afterwards worked into the 
structure of his system. Here he first conceived the thought 
of an educating instruction, and the possibility and benefit of 
reading the Odyssey in the original with boys of eight to ten 
years of age. Here we find him endeavouring to arouse in 
his pupils a many-sided interest, and to intertwine the pupil’s 
interest with the teacher’s own, by mutual study of the same 
subject. Here, in a word, he gained that wealth of educational 
experience, which enabled him twelve years later, when he had 
made trial of its worth practically and theoretically, to write 
as follows: “The teacher, as tutor to two or three pupils, 
sreates his own school. To him who hears the true artist’s call 
to education, the small dull space in which he at first perhaps 
feels himself confined, soon becomes so bright and large, that 
he discovers the whole of education therein, with all its motives 
and needs, the satisfaction of which is truly a work immeasur- 
able. Be he ever so learned, the boundary line of his know- 
ledge must fade away in the face of all that amongst which he 
ought to choose, if he would find what is best suited to his 
pupils. If he be at once strong and flexible, nevertheless the 
strength and the flexibility which he needs to rule perfectly, and 
protect the varied dispositions of those entrusted to his care, 
must appear to him an ideal. The home, with all its relation- 
ships and customs, must become infinitely valuable to him, so 
far as it helpfully co-operates, and what is wanting he must 
miss, that he may learn to desire it. Thus begins the education 
of the true teacher.”

liking to play the mentor to his younger brother, but full of 
deep feeling, loving, industrious, and eager after knowledge, 
became Herbart’s favourite pupil, and later on his devoted 
friend. Perhaps the knowledge, tact, affection, conscientious- 
ness, wide sympathies and touch of humour, which, combined 
with “faith in the good nature of healthy boys,”! made Her- 
bart almost an ideal teacher, are nowhere more perceptible 
than in the letters written to this boy after he had left the 
Steigers: “I know you find difficulty in putting your thoughts 
into words; this shows you do not think clearly enough, and 
tends to leave your teacher in the dark as to the best subjects 
and means for your instruction. . . . How useful it would 
be to you, and pleasant to me, if we could still work a while 
together; this depends in a great measure on whether you can 
express yourself clearly tome, In the summer you will read 
Phedrus. This book especially provides you with much to 
think about, and if you will tell me your thoughts and ask 
mine, I can continue to help you. Especially tell me which of 
the three authors, Xenophon, Plutarch, or Plato, gives you 
most pleasure, and which most food for thought; do not con- 
fuse these questions, and answer each separately.” After 
advice as to the way in which he must collect and order his 
thoughts—advice so clear and valuable to all boys who are in 
a fluid state mentally, that the temptation to quote in full is 
very great, the teacher in the letter gives place to the friend. 
“Tf you have no time to re-read what you have written, then 
the quickest letter will please me the best. I cannot give up 
my letter that you may make an ewercitiwm of it; please re-

rules I send you. Remember you must not be in the least 
slavishly bound by them; I mean them rather as hints. 
In all efforts for your own culture, in all attention turned on

you must fulfil for the sake of others. Until now you have

those surrounding you will suggest themselves to you more and 
more. It will help you to judge yourself in these matters, if I 
send you an extract from your last letter, which you no doubt 
wrote with the best intentions in the world. ‘ Zwar weis (weiss)

and not for your advantage and pleasure, but for mine ? Ought 
you to have refused it? Of course you know I would not for 
the sake of a mere foolish fancy ask you anything which cost 
you much time and trouble, but its value would doubtless have 
been as great to me as your trouble is to you. How would it, 
however, have been, had my aim been merely to judge of the 
education I had given you by its result P Would you then have 
undertaken the work, or would you rather have spent the time 
in learning by yourself? I expect the answer in your next

anything with you, follow the conversation where it leads, give 
your opinion modestly when you have one, best interrogatively ;

think over it afterwards, and try to follow it up at some con- 
venient time. Tell me if you understand him, and of what you

care most to speak with him. You see, my dear boy, my wishes 
are with you and my spirit would fain be with you also, and 
with those belonging to you.” 
Herbart’s progress in philosophical thought went on rapidly 
during this period in Switzerland. Whether absorbed in the 
view of the illimitably beautiful and sublime, woven together 
by nature in an Unnameable, or actively occupied in sounding 
with knowledge and sympathy the depths of the human heart, 
he felt himself more and more powerfully attracted to that 
unknown mysterious Unity beyond himself, which holds to- 
gether and animates all things, and imparts to them its hidden 
force. The problem of self-consciousness occupied his mind. 
Its solution formed the foundation of his metaphysics, and led 
the way to psychology, which, impelled by its value in educa- 
tion, he at once began to study. 
Political events which interrupted the education of his 
pupils, combined with personal considerations, determined 
Herbart to resign his post as teacher in 1799. He always 
remembered the Steigers’ household with affectionate grati- 
tude, and carried on an intimate correspondence with his pupil 
Karl till the year 1817. 
/ Life in In the house of his friend Schmidt, then Senator, 
Bremen. and afterwards Oberbiirgermeister of Bremen, Her- 
bart passed the next two years studying philosophy, his object 
being to complete his academic course, and thus qualify for a 
university chair. His Bremen friends, believing him to be the 
man to exercise a reforming influence on public education, 
wished to obtain for him a schoolmaster’s place in Bremen. 
His views of reform he gave in his work, Ideen zu einem 
padagogischen Lehrplan fiir hihere Studien (1801), and the 
method explained therein, which he maintained instruction in 
the ancient languages must adopt, forms an important supple- 
ment to his later writings on the same subject. 
In 1802 appeared his essay on Pestalozzi’s newly published 
work, Wie Gertrud thre Kinder lehrt. Its object was to 
help mothers of the middle and upper classes to form a correct 
estimate of its value. Herbart recognised the importance of 
the work, and pointed out with his usual clearness both the

  truth and limitations of its ideas. He had visited Pestalozzi in 
1799 at Burgdorf, and the essay contained the young philoso- 
pher’s impressions of the man of genius and his method of 
teaching. After describing the lesson which Pestalozzi had 
arranged at an unusual hour in the evening so that Herbart 
might be present, he criticises and justifies his method as 
follows: “ But why does Pestalozzi give so much to be learned 
by heart? Why does he seem to have chosen the subjects of 
instruction with so little consideration for the natural inclina- 
tions of children? Why does he only allow learning, never 
talks himself with the children, never chats, jokes, tells stories 
to them? Why is everything which might mitigate the 
seriousness of school life here scornfully banished P How is it 
that he, at the first glance such a friendly, lovable man, he 
who greets everything human with snch gentleness, whose first 
word to the stranger seems to say, ‘here he who deserves it 
will find a heart,’—how is it that he, amongst the children 
who possess his whole heart, no longer pours forth joy, no 
longer combines the pleasant with the useful ? ” 
“These questions did not trouble me so very much, although 
others have arisen from them. My own experiences and ex- 
periments had prepared me to estimate the mental power of 
children incomparably higher than is usual, and to seek the 
reason of their pleasure in instruction elsewhere than in super- 
fluous sporting, and their dislike of it elsewhere than in the 
assumed dryness and difficulty of such subjects as require 
seriousness and attention. What are considered the difficult 
and the easy, I have often found to be the exact contrary. I 
have long held that the sole and genuine root of instruction is 
a feeling of clear comprehension. And a perfect regularity in 
the sequence of studies adapted to all requirements, was to me 
the ideal, which I looked upon as the omnipresent means of 
securing to all instruction its true efficacy. It was the dis- 
covery of this sequence, of the arrangement and co-ordination 
of what was to be learned contemporaneously and what con- 
secutively, which formed, as I understood it, Pestalozzi’s chief 
aim. Granted he had found it, or at least was on the road to 
it, every unnecessary addition, every assistance by indirect

  means, would be harmful and objectionable, as diverting the 
mind from the main point. If that sequence still remained for 
him to find, or any way to improve and extend, his method is 
at least so far correct, that it rejected harmful superfiuities. 
Its laconic brevity is its most essential merit. No useless word 
was heard in the school; thus the train of understanding was 
never interrupted. The teacher spoke steadily to the children, 
the wrong letters were immediately rubbed off the slate, so the 
child could never linger over his mistakes. There was no 
deviation from the true course; therefore every moment was 
one of progress.”’ 
More important is Herbart’s treatise on Pestalozzi’s Idee 
eines A B O der Anschauwng, written on his conviction that 
the principle was one of the greatest value, not only in the 
elementary schools for which it was intended by Pestalozzi, but 
as applied in a developed form to the whole of education. The 
book, published in 1802, consists of an introduction, in which 
the value of Observation’ (Anschauung) as an educational 
factor is proved, and of three parts treating respectively of its 
nature, form, and employment. The cardinal fault of unculti- 
vated sight-perception, Herbart argues, is its concentration on 
colour ; observation (Anschauung) should correct it by exhibit- 
ing and fixing the attention on form. Of all the formative 
processes of education, cultivated observation is the most 
important, both for the child and boy, for it lays the solid 
foundation of future knowledge and judgment. The child is 
made up of desires, perceptions, and imaginations. From 
perceptions follows knowledge of nature and of objects, and 
they must preponderate, unless the child is to be ruled by 
caprice, the outcome of desires, or by delusion, the growth of ' 
imaginations. Imagination needs guidance, the desires a 
1 The word Observation is used here and afterwards as an approximate, 
but by no means exact equivalent for that difficult word, Anschauung. In 
Anschauung—a condition of reflective yet alert contemplation—there is an 
objective and subjective element, not included in the term Observation; there 
is first, perception by the child of the object or idea presented to him 
(objective), and secondly, his contemplation and reflection thereon (sub- 
jective).

counterpoise; both lend themselves to a keen observation of 
objects as they are, which means, in the case of children, as 
they are exhibited to them. Since the senses only discover 
easily what the mind knows how to see, the eye is worth 
nothing unless the mind is disciplined. To this end, the mind 
must observe, to the utmost degree of accuracy, differences of 
form. Forms must be studied systematically as form; their 
concepts must enter into and become an integral part of the 
mind’s contents. Mathematics contain the material gathered 
by the greatest minds of all ages for the study of form, and 
therefore the best material for the cultivation of Observation 
(Anschauung). Hence mathematics are indispensable for the 
beginning, middle, and end of an educating instruction. In- 
struction will overcome distraction—a child’s natural condition 
—when it has shown him the weakness, and at the same time 
the potential strength and capacity for cultivation of his intel- 
lect, and for this mathematics is the best instrument. In 
mathematics, and nowhere else, is to be sought the thread for 
a child’s early instruction, which can be so conditioned, that it 
shall provide an authority for its own use as well as for all 
other studies, at whose command distraction shall disappear 
and attention arise and endure.” This is the A B C of 
Anschawung. 
Since single points possess no form, and the connection of two 
points give only a line, 7.e. distance without form, the connec- 
tion of three points, 7.e. the triangle, is the most simple form, 
the element of all others, and, as such, the elementary form for 
Anschauung (Allg. Péidagogik, Book II., Chap. v. 1). 
It would be beyond the scope of the present sketch to follow 
Herbart’s demonstration of the value of the A B C of An- 
schawung, and its use for other subjects of study, especially 
geography and natural science, in the middle and later stages 
of an “educating instruction.” But his estimate of its value 
for the beginning of instruction just noticed, raises a question 
which will probably occur to all disciples of the new education, 
i.e. how far was Herbart indebted to Pestalozzi for his ideas 
and method ? 
Doubtless Herbart received the idea of “ Anschauung” in its
-P-A-G-E-34
  14 Science of Education. 
elementary form from Pestalozzi; it is equally beyond question, 
that the trae conception of its application throughout the whole 
sphere of education was Herbart’s alone. The latter’s own 
words confirm this. After considering “the grand idea (An- 
schauung) of the genial, the noble Pestalozzi,” he says: “ The 
discoverer has worked out the same for only a narrow sphere, 
that of elementary education ; it belongs, however, to the whole 
of education, but it needs for that an extended development.” ! 
The total absence of any scientific training, and ignorance of 
even the little psychology known to his predecessors, rendered 
Pestalozzi incapable of generalising from his experience the 
laws of mind, and consequently of demonstrating the validity 
of any law for all education. That he clearly felt the need 
thereof is certain; he expressed it by saying: ‘‘ Ich will den 
menschlichen Unterricht psychologisieren”’ (I wish to psycholo- 
gise instruction). ‘The first attempt to put the enlarged con- 
ception into practical shape was also Herbart’s—the A B C of 
Anschauung. The deductive method he there employs is 
obviously one which Pestalozzi, in his ignorance of the laws 
of logic, could neither have used nor suggested. All points to 
the inference, that Pestalozzi’s was the inspired idea, but its 
systematic expansion was Herbart’s. Nor is there any evidence 
to show that Herbart was in any sense a disciple of Pestalozzi, 
or that his educational activity and theories were started by 
him. Pestalozzi did not begin his work at Burgdorf, where 
Herbart visited him, till 1799 (and with the exception of a 
chance meeting at Zurich there is no record of any previous 
one), when Herbart was actively engaged as a teacher, and 
had in the Steiger letters, as has been before noticed, already 
formulated his theory of education. The points of contact be- 
tween the two teachers are many and striking. Herbart’s 
fundamental principle of psychology—presentations are the 
elements of which the mind is composed—and the deduction 
from it on which hangs his whole theory of education—viz. the 
giving of the presentations, or the formation of the circle of 
thought, is the work of the teacher—are, as he himself pointed 
  ! Introduction to A B C of Anschawung.

  out, the former the basis, the latter the counterpart of Pesta- 
lozzi’s practice. “The essence and the advantage of Pesta- 
lozzi’s method of instruction is . . . that it perceives its 
work is to build the child’s mind, to construct therein a definite 
and clearly perceived experience ; not to proceed as if the boy 
had already an experience, but to take care that he gains it.”? 
The order of instruction again was a question that both Herbart 
and Pestalozzi perceived to be of vital importance. Both alike 
also shared the conviction which ushered in a new epoch of 
education, that this order ought to be absolutely and solely 
determined by the advancing stages and corresponding needs 
of the child’s development. ‘ A perfect regularity in the 
sequence of studies adapted to all requirements was to me the 
ideal which I looked upon as the ever present means of insur- 
ing to all instruction its real efficacy. It was the discovery of 
this sequence, of the arrangement and co-ordination of what 
was to be learned synchronously and what consecutively, which 
formed, as I understood it, Pestalozzi’s chief aim.”® We need 
not multiply examples of these harmonies of ideas; they are to 
be considered not as composed of theories derived by Herbart 
from Pestalozzi, but rather as instances of the many points of 
contact which a great and inspired effort like Pestalozzi’s 
offers to a different system of thought. 
Life in In May, 1802, Herbart left Bremen for Géttingen, 
Gottingen. where he obtained his Doctor’s degree in open dispu- 
tation, and began his academic work with lectures on philo- 
sophy and pedagogy: These lectures, carefully thought out, 
and always delivered extempore, soon attracted to his audi- 
torium the whole philosophical life of Géttingen. Among his 
hearers was his former pupil and present friend, Carl von 
Steiger; and, with him and a few other young men, who 
eagerly shared his educational plans and work, Herbart began 
an intimate and stimulating intercourse. Conscious he was in 
his right place, he refused a post in Heidelberg, where he 
would have received an income four times as large as that at

Gottingen. The humiliating position in which Germany then 
stood to France affected every unit of the defeated nation. 
Out of his stipend of £45 a year and the small income he 
derived from other sources, Herbart was compelled to con- 
tribute his quota of 1,500 francs to war expenses; and what was 
to him far worse, the unhappy state of the country and its 
uncertain future, predisposed its sons to enter business rather 
than study philosophy. But the troubles of the time, which 
shattered the faith of the many, might ruffle the surface, but 
could not disturb the depths of his serene and hopeful nature. 
“I never lost my belief in noble hearts or in knowledge,” he 
writes at this time; and the list of his works published during 
the Géttingen period of seven years, affords abundant evidence 
that his intellectual force flowed on, not only untroubled, but 
with ever-increasing strength. In 1802 appeared the A BO 
of Anschauung, to which was added to the second edition of 
1804, Die aesthetische Darstellung der Welt als das Hauptge- 
schift der Erziehung. In 1804 was published Standpunkt der 
Bevirtheilung der Pestalozzi’schen Unterrichtsmethode; in 1806, 
Allgemeine Pddagogik (his principal work on education), 
Hauptpunkie der Metaphystk, and Hauptpunkte der Logik. 
The latter, commenced one mid-day, was sent to the printers 
the next noon, a proof of the perfection which any subject of 
thought reached in Herbart’s mind before he put pen to paper. 
In 1808 he finished his Allgemeine praktische Philosophie, and 
lastly in 1809 he prefaced and added some important com- 
ments on three papers written by his scholars, Dissen, Thiersch, 
and Kohlrausch. The prospects of the University ultimately 
became “so dark and uncertain,” that Herbart accepted a call 
to Konigsberg in 1809. ‘“ How happy I was,” he writes, “ to

  cherished idea, that, ‘“‘in education, theory and practice should 
always go together.” Not satisfied with teaching theoretic 
pedagogy, he desired to found a sort of pedagogic seminary, 
where his hearers could apply practically the principles which 
they had learned from him in the class-room. “ Amongst my 
duties,” he writes, “I had the lectures on education very much 
at heart. But education cannot merely be taught; it must be 
demonstrated and practised. Besides, I wish to extend my ten 
years’ experiences in it. So I long ago conceived the idea of 
teaching a small number of selected boys myself for an hour 
daily, in the presence of some young men acquainted with my 
pedagogy, who will afterwards attempt in my place and under 
my eye, to carry on what I have begun. Gradually in this 
way teachers may be trained, whose methods must be perfected 
by mutual observation and exchange of experience. Since a 
plan of instruction is worthless without teachers, and more- 
over such teachers as are inspired by the spirit of the plan, and 
skilled in the use of the method, perhaps a small experimental 
school such as I propose will be the best preparation for future 
and more extended movements. Kant’s saying is: ‘ First ex- 
perimental, then normal, schools.’”” The idea that Herbart 
would reform education on Pestalozzi’s lines aroused the live- 
liest sympathy in Prussia; and from the Prussian government, 
through William von Humboldt, the Minister of Education, 
whom he found to be ‘a learned, humane man, by no means 
ignorant of philosophy,” he received full liberty to carry out 
his plan, and permission to choose an assistant at a yearly 
salary of 200 thalers (£30). 
But that plan did not stop with the training of 
the teachers. He had always believed and taught 
with Pestalozzi, that family life was “the ground on which 
education ought to grow,”! and he sought now to provide the 
pupils with the best substitute for it in his own home. This Marriage. 
' In this belief he was in opposition to the prevailing opinion generated 
by the war excitement, and to Fichte, its exponent in particular. The 
lutter advocated education under State control, and considered its primary 
object was ‘‘ to awake the civic and military spirit and the duty of love to 
God, King, and Fatherland,”

became practicable after his marriage in 1811 with a young 
English lady, Mary Drake, the daughter of one of the first 
merchants in Memel. Having been ruined by the war, her 
father returned to England, leaving her, a girl of eighteen, at 
Konigsberg. There, in the boarding-house to which he went 
on his arrival, he met her for the first time, and after an 
acquaintance of six weeks he determined to win her for his 
wife. Bothin character and education she was entirely worthy 
of his choice. ‘True to the highest ideal of wifehood, “ wise, 
not that she might set herself above her husband, but that she 
might never fail from his side,” their union seems to have 
been one of hearts and minds, and as such to have brought 
them a fulness of happiness during their twenty-nine years of 
marriage impossible under any other conditions. From this 
home life as a centre, with its society of kindred spirits, Her- 
bart’s activity went forth in various directions, quickened by 
the recognition and esteem which now came forth spontane- 
ously to meet him on many sides. The government expressed 
its feeling practically, by appointing him Director of the Royal 
Examination Commission, and by giving him an addition to his 
stipend. He was repeatedly invited to Court, though “ this 
society,” he said, ‘‘ interests me but little,” and hardly a half- 
year passed in which he was not elected to sit on the governing 
body of some college. More precious to him than all this, as a 
sign of the growing appreciation of his teaching, and of that 
regard which honoured him as the most renowned professor of 
the University, was the crowd which filled his auditorium to 
overflowing, where his hearers could no longer find room to sit 
and write the heads of his lectures. For their use, and his’ 
own, during the last troubled months of 1812, when Moscow 
was burned, and Koénigsberg burdened with foreign troops, he 
drew a clear and concise outline of his philosophical lectures, 
Lehrbuch zur Hinleitung in Philosophie, his best known and 
most widely read book. It treats of the nature of concepts, of 
the great problems in their simplest form from which philo- 
sophy is evolved. It avoided as far as possible, the ready-made 
dogmas of philosophical systems, leading the scholar to con- 
jecture with thought unbiassed, through a strictly ordered

  course of enquiry, the place in the distance where truth was 
to be found. The criticisms which the book called forth, 
Herbart answered in his work Ueber meinen Streit mit der 
Modephilosophie. 
Psychology was the subject on which, during the Konigsberg 
period, Herbart concentrated his greatest strength. In 1811 
appeared the Psychologischen Bemerkungen zur Tonlehre, the 
Psychologische Untersuchung tiber die Starke einer gegebenen 
Vorstellung als Funktion threr Dauer betrachtet, and in 1812 
the treatise Ueber die dunkle Seite der Pidagogik. He com- 
pleted his System of Psychology in 1814, but the conditions 
of the time being unfavourable to the publication of a detailed 
work, he deferred it for ten years. Meanwhile he compiled 
as a text-book, for his current lectures the Lehrbuch zur Psycho- 
logie. Its clear, concise language, and emphasis of what is 
important and essential, its direction of the reader’s attention 
to all the chief classes of mental phenomena, the attractive 
manner in which the centra] thought is used, less as a specu- 
lative dogma than as a hypothesis justified by its fruitful- 
ness, and finally the suggestions so stimulating to thought for 
the further use of that hypothesis—all combine to make this 
Lehrbuch of great value to the scholar. His chief psychological 
work, Psychologie als Wissenschaft neu gegriindet auf Erfahrung, 
Metaphysik, und Mathematik, appeared in two parts, 1824-25. 
The system of metaphysics on which the fundamental prin- 
ciple of his psychology, 7.e. that presentations are the ultimate 
forms of all psychical life, rested, was not published till 
1828-29, and the difficulty of comprehending the book was 
consequently much increased. 
Herbart saw that Metaphysics was the science, which suffers 
most from the errors of all other branches of knowledge. With 
the view of keeping it as free as possible from these errors, he 
therefore first completed his Ethics, which were independent of 
all metaphysical speculation, then his Psychology on its meta- 
physical foundation, and finally his Metaphysics. The Allge- 
meine Metaphysik nebst den Anfingen der philosophischen 
Naturlehre, published in two parts (1828-29) bears witness 
to its author’s intellectual energy and many-sidedness. It con-

tains the foundation of Herbart’s philosophy, and as such the 
final material necessary for forming a judgment on it. With. 
this—the book which had cost him more labour than any other 
—his system of philosophy was completed, and the danger that 
posterity would receive a distorted picture of that philosophy 
was at an end. 
Of the great number of smaller essays, lectures, etc., which 
Herbart produced at Koénigsberg, we can here mention but a 
few. In Erziehung unter dffentlicher Mitwirkung (1810), in- 
tended to arouse interest in his educational projects, he started 
the novel idea that trained pedagogues should live in every 
town, and, like doctors, be called in by parents to give their 
advice for each child, as to the proper ordering of studies, 
and on all questions of education. The Verhdltniss der Schule 
zum Leben (1818) was an attempt to show the State would 
best forward its interest by leaving the schools under self-con- 
trol. Two important fragments are the Briefe iiber Anwendung 
der Psychologie auf die Pddagogik and the treatise on das 
Verhdltniss des Idealismus zur Paidagogik (1831). In the same 
year he published the Hncyclopidie der Philosophie. 
The Teacher’s Institute before mentioned, being dependent 
in its internal arrangements on the constantly changing pupils, 
was never permanently organised in its original form. It was 
extended into a training college, and the course of instruction 
adapted to the four middle classes of the Gymnasium, the boys 
being instructed sixteen hours a week by four students. Her- 
bart himself gave the mathematical lessons with extraordinary 
success, but took no other active part in the work of the insti- 
tution beyond supplying the students with continual hints, and 
meeting them at a weekly conference on instruction and disci- 
pline. The strong opposition which met his attempt to begin 
the course of instruction with the study of Homer soon ceased, 
for his youthful experiences with his Swiss pupils were re- 
peated in the pleasure and profit with which the Konigsberg 
boys read the Odyssey under the guidance of teachers trained 
by him. But the general ignorance and prejudices of the 
parents were a fruitful source both of annoyance and amuse- 
ment. The parents, for instance, of a promising eight-year-old

boy, whose ideal of education was the learning of Bible texts 
and fluent newspaper reading, were astounded when instead of 
the mental delicacies ordered, their son related the unheard-of 
things he was taught—about substantives and adjectives, what 
a river was, and how its course was determined by the moun- 
tains and valleys of the country. What was the use, they 
asked, of pointing out to him the doings and sufferings of his 
fellow creatures, and their simplest relations, when he would 
see them for himself soon enough ? When he talked of circles, 
and began to measure the door and window angles, they de- 
clared that they had got on in the world well enough, thank 
God, without such knowledge, which only made folks worldly. 
But their indignation and alarm reached its climax, when some 
neighbours enlightened them as to the truly heathenish re- 
ligious instruction their son in common with the other pupils 
was receiving, ¢.e. that he must look on all men without dis- 
tinction as brothers, since God is the common Father of all. 
How these obstacles were overcome, and by what means the 
boy in question became a promising pupil, is amusingly and in- 
structively told in the half-yearly report of the seminary, from 
which this description is taken. It was written for Herbart at 
his request by his student-teacher Gregor. Another report, of 
the year 1823, gives the following account of the course of in- 
struction, which was given strictly on Herbart’s principles :— 
“ Greek was begun with boys from eight to ten years old by 
translating in their order Homer (the Odyssey), Herodotus, and 
Xenophon, the teacher preparing the pupil (in the historical 
and geographical details of the book), then translating it with 
him, and afterwards gradually giving from it the elements of 
grammar. After Xenophon, Latin was begun with Virgil’s 
Aineid, which was prepared for by a short study of Eutropius. 
Historical lessons from ancient history on the model of an an- 
cient writer (for instance Livy), and plane and sphere observation- 
exercises (Anschauungs-tibungen) necessitating the teacher’s 
knowledge of trigonometry, were given pari passu. Backward 
boys were stimulated by analytical conversations on familiar 
objects. Generally in the thirteenth year, or as soon as Cesar 
could be read fluontly, Latin syntax was begun, which, with

examples, was learned accurately by heart in from six to nine 
months, but no exercises were set, lest the pupil should acquire 
the habit of writing errors. Such written exercises, for which 
the pupil was prepared by learning whole chapters from Cicero 
and Cesar, were begun when the syntax was finished, and at 
the same time as the comparative Greek and Latin syntax. 
Then followed the translation of Homer’s Iliad, and afterwards 
Plato and Cicero, that the pupil might be introduced to a sys- 
tem of ethics. Mathematical instruction grew out of the ob- 
servation-exercises before referred to; the pupil was taken 
quickly through geometry, trigonometry, and algebra, up to 
logarithms, with the help of the integral and differential cal- 
culus. Then followed, with more expenditure of time, conic 
sections, and the elements of astronomy, and finally some prob- 
lems in statics and higher mechanics.” 
The Konigsberg seminary was closed in 1833, when Herbart 
left for Géttingen, but the master’s spirit and principles were, 
and are, living and active in his scholars. In 1836 Brzoska, 
for some time Herbart’s head teacher at K6nigsberg, published 
a work entitled Die Nothwendigkeit pidagogischer Seminare auf 
der Universitit. In 1843 Stoz founded the Pedagogic Society 
in Jena, out of which grew later a seminary and school, lately 
re-organised by Prof. Rein. In 1862 Ziller, one of Herbart’s 
most able exponents, founded a pedagogic seminary and 
practising school at Leipsic. The seminarium and precep- 
torium in Hallé, resuscitated by the late Dr. O. Frick, is now 
conducted on Herbart’s principles, and the teaching in the 
seminary for higher teachers in Giessen, directed by Prof. 
Schiller, is largely influenced by Herbart’s ideas. 
The attitude of the reactionary party in the government to- 
wards the universities, which were suspected, especially after 
the murder of Kotzebue by the student Sand, of “ harbouring 
and fostering democratic intrigues,” exercised so repressive an 
effect on their freedom of enquiry that Herbart determined to 
find work elsewhere, if possible outside Prussia. At Schultze’s 
death, he accepted the offer of his vacant chair at the Gottingen 
University, and left Kénigsberg in 1833, followed by the uni- 
versally expressed regret and esteem of his colleagues and pupils.

Second period He devoted the greater part of his later years to 
at Gottingen. the preparation and delivery of his university lec- 
tures, consequently his literary productions at this period were 
few. Among them, however, was an educational work second 
only in importance to the Allg. Paidagogik, and written as its 
supplement—Umriss pddagogischer Vorlesungen (1835). To the 
second edition of 1841, Herbart appended his Umriss der allge- 
meinen Pédagogik, in which the fundamental thought of that 
book in its relation to psychology is more fully exhibited. It 
called forth a most favourable criticism in the Pedagogic Review, 
where it was termed “a veritable teacher’s breviary.” The 
essay Uber die Subswmption unter die ontologischen Begriffe, the 
letters, Zur Lehre von der Fretheit des menschlichen Willens, and 
the Analytische Beleuchtung des Naturrechts und der Moral ap- 
peared in 1835-36, and a second edition of the Hncyclopéddie der 
Philosophie in 1841. With the exception of a short interlude, 
during which his attitude to the government was misconstrued 
into one of weak submission, his lectures were as largely 
attended as at Konigsberg, and even more enthusiastically 
received. His conduct he explained and fully justified in the 
Erinnerung an die Gottingische Katastrophe, 1837, which, how- 
ever, at his own wish, was not published till after his death. 
That death was fast approaching. With appa- 
rently unimpaired intellectual and bodily strength, 
he gave his usual lecture on the 9th of August, 1841. The 
following evening, his last on earth, he spent with his family, 
who specially noted in him that kindness and cheerfulness 
which had increased with years. On the llth came the fatal 
stroke of apoplexy which ended his life almost instantaneously, 
and in the early dawn of the August morning he passed away 
to a brighter day. The students, who not a week before had 
listened to their beloved teacher for the last time, carried his 
body to its final resting-place. The marble cross which marks 
the spot bears the following inscription :— Death. 
‘“‘To penetrate the sacred depths of Truth, 
To strive in joyful hope for human weal, 
Was his life’s aim ; 
Now his free spirit hath the perfect light, 
Here rests his mortal frame.”

  HERBART’S PHILOSOPHY AND PRINCIPLES OF 
EDUCATION. 
The significance of Herbart’s life and work for the teacher 
arises from the fact, that education with him was the starting 
point and end of all his “Investigations. He was, as Prof. 
Strumpell ‘remarks, the | only modern thinker who has not 
treated education casually in his works, or looked at it, as 
the whole weighs. of his philosophy and ethics to operate on it, 
and construct it into a scientific system, He not only sought, 
found, and ‘explained its psychological basis, but he did this in 
the light of his larger philosophy. “‘I for my part,” he writes, 
“have for twenty years called _ to > my aid metaphysics ar and 7 
mathematics, besides self-observation, experience, and experi- 
ments, in order only to find the foundation of true psychologic 
“knowledge.”~ TRO AWA eae re 
To andesite Rovhast’s philosophy, upon which are based 
the Aesthetische Darstellung der Welt and Allgemeine Péidagogik, 
a few words as to its points of agreement with, and divergence 
from, Kant’s philosophy, are necessary. 
Kant rejected the false ethical principle that, if the desires 
are satisfied, the moral worth of that which satisfies them is 
proved thereby. A system of morality whose judgments are 
passed not on the will itself, but on its capacity to attain a 
preconceived end, was to him false. He held that the good 
will alone has absolute value,’ its goodness again being entirely 
independent of any effect its actions may, or may not, have on 
its Own or. others” _good or 3 ill. To him all material principles, 
and, since experience only yields what is material, all empirical 
_ principles were worthless; all determinations of worth must 
follow from formal sini plldk, and therefore praise or blame be

  given to the will in consideration of its form alone.! From this 
followed a conclusion essential to the scientific foundation of 
ethics, i.e. that practical philosophy? must be treated inde- 
pendently of theoretical. In these fundamental principles the 
philosophies of Herbart and Kant were in entire agreement. 
But Kant further attempted to make this notion of duty the 
scientific basis of morality. To him the binding nature of duty 
was a universal law, and as such,? harmony or disharmony 
with it constituted the moral or immoral will. Its worth he 
sought to find in its unconditioned origin in pure reason, the 
categorical imperative, “thou shalt” being the command of 
reason to the will. But that he might prove its validity a 
priort. he was compelled in his doctrine of transcendental free- 
dom to introduce theoretical speculation once more into ethics.* 
Herbart rejected on the one hand Kant’s theory of trans- 
cendental freedom, on the other, that of fatalism. The former 
made education, as he conceived it, an illusion; for to try to 
influence the moral condition of a being whose will could effect 
its own freedom independently of all influence, was obviously a 
useless and therefore foolish attempt.® Fatalism too, made 
education impossible; for if the latter were not to be an empty 
name, and the cultivation of morality a chimera, a certain 
possibility of cultivation must be presupposed. In Herbart’s 
system of ethics, the notion of duty occupies only a secondary 
place. “If the notion of duty,” he writes, “is to be the first 
principle of ethics, a direct certainty of the validity of an 
original command must exist—but it does not. For to com- 
mand is to will, and if a command as such be possessed of 
  1 The first principles different philosophies set up respectively, as that 
from which the manifold ethical relationships they contain are severally 
deduced, are either material or formal. The first principle of a philosophy 
is called material, when it makes the criterion of morality a definite object 
of the will, for instance happiness, or conformity to nature, etc. ; it is for- 
mal when it makes the goodness or badness of the will to consist not in a 
definite object of the will, but in a definite manner of willing.

original certainty, then one act of volition as such must take 
the precedence of others, which are subservient to it. (But each 
“will, as will, is equal to any other will. Consequently, since no 
will, as will, is superior to any other, no command, as such, has 
an original right to command. Hence that which is com- / 
manded, cannot as such carry with it the obligation of duty. ) ) 
Therefore the notion ¢ of duty is deduced, and hence can wn form 
no part of | the basis. of. pr actical_ philosophy ” (Sdammt. Werke, 
x. p. 20). Herbart thus proved that the universality of the 
law, notwithstanding its necessity and utility, did not supply 
the primary basis for estimating moral worth. That which 
gives to command its authority, to obedience its value, to 
virtue its glory, to duty its obligation, and removes the re- 
proach of despotism and servitude, must be determined antece- 
dently to any command or obligation.!. In this conviction he 
writes, ‘‘ It was a mistake to begin the science of ethics with 
the categorical imperative.” He pointed out further, that in 
taking the autonomy of the will for granted, a dual will in the 
same subject must also be conceived; te. an obeying and a 
commanding will, whereby everything else can be more easily 
explained, than the singular precedence of one will over another 
in the same subject. Repeatedly did Herbart reject the doc- 
trine of transcendental freedom,’ and especially in relation to 
education expose its dangerous conclusions. We have now 
briefly to consider what he offered in its place. 
For Kant’s categorical imperative, by which reason commands 
the will to act conformably to the moral law, Herbart substi- 
tuted his five practical ideas, placing the “imperative,” as we 
have seen, in a secondary position in virtue of its derived 
nature. Kant’s “thou shalt,” itself the expression of a will, 
implied a knowledge of that which has the sole unconditional 
right to assume the authority of law; that is to say, a judg- 
ment independent of the will, which could estimate its value. 
Since the value of the will is, as we have seen, to be determined

-P-A-G-E-47
  Introduction by the Lranslators. 27 
by its form, such a judgment could only refer to relationships 
of will, and therefore these relationships supplied, according to 
Herbart, the formal first principles of ethics. Contemplated by 
the mind, each relationship calls forth an independent judgment 
of approval or disapproval. This judgment must be invo- 
Inntary and absolute, springing alone from the pure contem- 
plation of the relationship, utterly without proof since none is 
possible, and thus it is identical in nature with the judgment 
which we pass at once without any logical evidence on musical 
harmonies or discords when hearing them.! On the strength 
of this analogy, based on their involuntary origin and certainty ~ 
without proof, between the judgments of will and those of art, 
Herbart extended the term esthetic judgment to the former as 
well as the latter, and it is thus used in the Darstellung. Every 
sphere of art has thus its own relationships, and, answering 
thereto, its own code of taste embodied in these involuntary 
jadgments. A well-conceived work of art, combining with its 
own relationships many from other branches of art, may call 
into activity a corresponding variety of tastes. But we can 
only conceive a combined totality of these ideal appeals to 
taste, including the moral which is in the background of every 
work of art—in an esthetic comprehension and revelation of 
the world which unites in itself “‘ the fitting, the beautiful, the 
moral, the just; in one word, that which in its perfect state 
pleases after perfect contemplation.’”® Such a revelation Her- 
bart conceived to be the chief work of education,® and the sum 
total of original, involuntary judgments which it would arouse 
in the pupil supplied the material which he would ultimately 
form into the law of his life.4 
Herbart sought out “the simplest conceivable relations of 
will which can follow from its activity directed on the Ego or 
on other volitions or objects.? In thinking out these relation- 
ships, and in the effort to press them as it were into com- 
pendious concepts, he arrived at his five practical (7.e. moral)

-P-A-G-E-48
  28 Science of Education. 
ideas, which are an exhaustive series of types of volitional per- 
fection. They are the following :— 
I. The Idea of Inner Freedom, which arises from the harmo- 
unions selukeaplion bbtwees 7OGROn on the one side, and moral 
insight and conviction on the other side of an individual. The 
will is then free from external influence, and is controlled 
alone by the inner judgment. Herbart,in his Kurze Darstellung 
eines Planes zu philosophischen Vorlesungen, defines this idea of 
inner freedom as “harmony with oneself, not the empty, 
vague identity of the modern idea, but the Platonic dixarocivy, 
the harmonious triad of codia, cwhpocivyn, and davdpeia.” Of 
these copia is practical insight, taste, dvdpeta the active willing, 
cwppootvy the control of the will, which is at the same time 
reservation from every opposing will. 
II. The Idea of Perfection or Efficiency (Vollkommenheit), 
“as a correct measure of the strength at which the judgment, 
or the law-giving will, should arrive,” arises from a comparison 
of the various degrees of the will’s efforts, and is defined by 
Herbart in terms of magnitude. The terms of this relation 
may or may not exist in the same person. These terms are (1) 
Intensity, z.e. strength of degree; (2) Extension, z.e. variety 
of objects compassed by the will; (3) Concentration of the 
will going out in many directions on a main effort. Here, as 
in the whole realm of the esthetic, both the greater and smaller 
efforts of the will command the approval of the judgment. No 
absolute standard of approval or disapproval exists. The efforts 
which in the process of comparison prove to be greater, serve 
the smaller efforts as standards to which they must relatively 
attain, if they are not to arouse disapproval. Inso far as this 
actually takes place, the conception arising therefrom consti- 
tutes the idea of perfection (Vollkommenheit, that is, “‘ Des 
Kommens zu seiner Fiille’’). 
In his work Ueber meinen Streit mit der Modephilosophie, Her- 
bart shows that of the five Practical Ideas, that of Perfection 
has at first the most direct bearing on the pupil; asa being full 
of effort and force going forth in all directions, he first falls under 
1 Herbartian System of Pedagogics, Dr. C. de Garmo. 
 
-P-A-G-E-49
  Introduction by the Translators. 29 
the judgment which that idea calls forth. Taking its contents, 
which expressed in terms of magnitude are, as we have seen, of 
a threefold nature, Intensity, Extension, and Concentration of 
power, he argues that since intensity of power in the pupil is 
for the most part a natural gift, and concentration on a main 
ovject, is neither possible nor desirable in early life, only the 
third magnitude, extension remains for the activity of teacher 
and pupil—that is, expansion of power over an unlimited num- 
ber of objects, the greater the number the better; in other 
words, the formation of a many-sided and balanced interest, 
which he names as the first part of the educational aim.' 
In his Lehrbuch zur Einleitung in die Philosophie, Herbart, 
while pointing out the direct dependence of education on all 
the practical ideas, especially lays stress on the idea of per- 
fection, “ not on account of its greater importance, but because 
that part of the educational aim determined by it (the vitality 
of a many-sided interest) requires the greatest expenditure of 
manifold efforts, and because by it at the same time the basis 
of the remaining moral culture is won.” 
Although the judgment occasioned by the relationship in 
inner freedom and in perfection is absolute, it is nevertheless 
incomplete, since in both relationships the will in itself may be 
entirely praiseworthy, while in other aspects it may be blamable. 
Thus the will may act according to its moral insight, but that 
insight may be at fault. And while the quantity of a powerful 
will may command the approving judgment, its quality may 
be open to censure. 
In the remaining three relationships of will, the volitions of 
two or more individuals must necessarily play their part. 
Ill. The Idea of Benevolence (goodwill) arises out of the 
relationship of two wills to each other, the one will existent 
in an individual, and the efforts of the other upon which it is 
directed being present in the mind of that individual. When 
the acting will, either in accordance with, or in opposition to 
that other will, makes the satisfaction or dissatisfaction of 
the latter its object, a judgment of approval in the one, of

disapproval in the other case, is aroused, and the resultant 
idea is that of benevolence or malevolence. If the acting will 
considers the will it represents to itself, not as independent of 
itself, but as only a means to its own ends (self-seeking), the 
judgment of absolute approval disappears. To make the actual 
results of its acts the measure of the worth of benevolence is 
to misconceive and corrupt the idea. 
Herbart identifies the idea of benevolence with “ the abso- 
lute good, which our religion calls love,’+ As such it forms 
the main thought of Christianity, at once its aim and end. 
The idea of benevolence arises, as just shown, out of the 
relation of an acting to an imagined and independent will. 
Two actual wills may come in contact with each other, but they 
only become actual to each other through expression, through 
action, and action is the necessary condition of the remaining 
relations of will. 
IV._The Idea of Right rests upon the agreement of several 
wills as a fixed principle, le, by means of which that which arouses 
absolute disapproval in a conflict—that is, the mutual thwart- 
ing of two wills existent in separate individuals—is removed 
or prevented. Volition here is no longer, as in the relation of 
benevolence, existent in the mind alone, and through the aim 
for which it strives it trenches upon the will of another. 
NW. The Idea. of quit ity or Retribution is founded on the 
balancing of a previous relationship which has been disturbed 
by a premeditated and compassed external act of good or ill; 
that is, its object is satisfaction, equitable reparation. Since 
this act affects the second will, it arouses approval or dis- 
approval. Moral judgment requires that an equal amount of 
good or ill should return back again upon the doer of the deed. 
Thus arises the idea of retribution or equity. 
With this the series of the original practical ideas closes. 
Taken in their totality they supply the notion of moral good, 
and hence their due and relative proportion to each other must 
be strictly observed. The sacrifice of one or more to the rest 
disturbs the balance of a well-ordered life.

  Applied to society the original ideas yielded for Herbart the 
following five derivative ideas. From the Idea of Perfection 
came that of a System of Culture; from the Idea of Benevo- 
lence that of an Administrative System; from the Idea of 
Right that of a law-abiding Society (Rechtsgesellschaft) ; from 
the Idea of Equity or Retribution that of a System of Rewards 
or Wages; and from the Idea of Inner Freedom that of an 
Ideal Society. 
In deducing the five sociological from the original ideas, 
Herbart rose above the then current conception of practical 
philosophy, and uniting its hitherto divided parts—moral and 
natural right—presented them as the indivisible basis of a 
regenerated society. In the practical philosophy of that time 
the morality of individuals, or of society, did not enter into the 
calculations of natural right—that is, of law and political 
economy; and the State was nothing more than a power en- 
forcing order under all circumstances among its citizens, and 
providing for their safety, but in no way concerned with their 
inclinations as such. The mind of Herbart, dissatisfied with 
these arbitrary and superficial divisions, pierced to the under- 
lying unity, and saw that the practical ideas which supplied 
the ideal to the individual will, must also regulate every form 
of social life—the family and the community, the State and the 
Church. In this manner he arrived at the derivative ideas. 
His theory of education and the State sprang from a common 
origin, the former from the application of ethics and _ psy- 
chology to the individual, the latter from their application to 
man as a member of society. The whole aim of education, 
according to Herbart, is contained in the one word, morality.} 
Its whole work is to form a character which in the battle of 
life shall stand unmoved, not through the strength of its ex- 
ternal action, but on the firm and enduring foundation of its 
moral insight and enlightened will.” Not only are all measures 
1 Aesthetische Darstellung der Welt, p. 57. 
2 «Since morality has its place singly and only in individual volition 
founded on right insight, it follows of itself first and foremost that the 
work of moral education is not by any means to develop a certain external 
mode of action, but rather insight together with eer volition in 
the mind of the pupil.”—Allg. Pdd., bk. 1 ch, ii.

of education (government and discipline) to contribute to this 
work, but all instruction, ‘‘the whole treasure of accumulated 
research in a concentrated form,” which must be given to the 
pupil in the light thrown by psychology on the mind’s gradual 
development, is to advance it, and its worth is to be measured 
by its power of doing so. In like manner, the aim of the State, 
as “a society guarded by force,” must be to become a com- 
munity inspired and penetrated by moral ideas. To Herbart 
the State was no mere political body, whose power was to be 
‘limited to the administration and defence of law, and the just 
distribution of reward and punishment, but a corporation which, 
by its benevolent administration, its furtherance of moral cul- 
ture, its protection of individual freedom consistent with social 
order, and its elevation of the general tone of the community, 
ould make itself felt as a moral force. 
In order fully to estimate the service which Herbart rendered 
to education, an exhaustive study of his philosophical writings 
is necessary, especially his conception of the relation in which 
education ought to stand to its foundation sciences, meta- 
—— ethics, and psychology. Here it is only pos: possible to 
indicate the extent of that service in the direction of psy- 
         
           
             
                   
   
     Philosophers before Herbart (Wolff, Kant, and his disciples) 
adhered to Aristotle’s principle, but slightly modified, that the 
soul is the dwelling-place of higher and lower capacities, en- 
tirely separate from each other. According to this theory, 
mental processes lying open to the observation of experience, 
were classified into smaller and larger divisions according to 
their similitude. All phenomena of one kind were regarded 
as effects of a single capacity, originally inherent in the soul. 
Three chief capacities were assumed— knowledge, feeling, and 
will, each of which was again separated into its sub-capacities, 
the result being a system which was nothing more than a classi- 
fication of so-called capacities. Given these as the material for 
their work, the old school of teachers set before itself a corre- 
sponding diversity of aims, each of which was to be reached by 
a separate road, and imagined an all-round perfection of the 
single capacity would follow from its concentration on one

object. Herbart proved! not. only the falsity of this theory, 
but also that, were it true, education in its noblest conception 
would be but an empty word. 
Educational problems *~~* ‘irected him to the study of psy- 
chology, and, convincea . its supreme importance not only for 
them but for natural philosophy, and the philosophy of history, 
ethics, and politics, he pursued it with never-failing energy for 
the rest of his life. Relegating in its light the “ capacities ” to 
the region of myth, he may be said to have created, as the 
result of his long and deep research, a natural history of the 
human mind. He proved how vain was the attempt to deduce 
from the capacities, the conformity of mental activity to law, 
or to reconcile with their multiplicity the simple nature of the 
soul and the unity of consciousness, how irrational to consider 
as original those endowments of the soul, which are the result of 
a long process of development. The arguments by which 
Herbart disposed of the theory are too long to give here; they 
are contained in his Lehrbuch zur Psychologie and Psychologie 
als Wissenschaft. But we must briefly consider the theory he 
substituted, for it provides the field for, and the single aim of, 
education as he conceived it. 
The proposition, then, which forms the basis of his psychology 
is,—that presentations (Vorstellungen) are the elements of 
mental life, and their combinations, permutations, and interac- 
tions cause all the rest of the manifold forms of consciousness. 
They are to psychology what the elements are to chemistry, and 
cellsto physiology. By a presentation, Herbart means not only 
the complex idea presented to the mind through sense, to which 
the term is usually applied (for instance the idea of a chain), but 
the numerous elementary ideas to the furthest extremity of 
thought of which it is composed. Inborn presentations there 
are none. The soul is a tabula rasa, whose only original power 
is that of entering through the medium of the nervous system 
into reciprocal relations with the external world. These relations 
supply the mind with its primordial presentations—the sen- 
suous ones of sight, hearing, smell, taste, touch, pleasure, pain. 
1 Pédagogik als Wissenschaft, 
 
-P-A-G-E-54
  34 Science of Education. 
They are to the mind what the postulates and axioms are to 
Euclid ; from them its whole after-contents are derived. 
The primordial presentations constitute, however, but a small 
part of the mind’s contents; their interaction produces the 
derived presentations, which in their varied developments form 
the greater part. Presentations once created, the recurrence 
of the sensuous impression, which necessarily entered into the 
process, is unnecessary; they are an abiding portion of the 
mind’s contents, playing their part, now one of re-presentation 
in consciousness, without further aid from the special sense 
organs. Those among them which are the distinct and abso- 
lute reflection of the thing or idea that caused them, are capable 
of development by the processes of comparison, abstraction, 
generalisation, into concepts (indirect, sensuous presentations), 
which form the material for the higher and highest processes 
of thought. For the union of two concepts in a proposition 
involves an act of judgment, and the inference or conclusion, 
the induction or deduction we draw from such judgments 
involves an act of reasoning. 
The masses of presentations which the teacher finds already 
existent in the child’s mind have two main sources, experience 
and intercourse. It is the teacher’s work to create from 
the former knowledge, from the latter sympa'hy, by means of 
an educating instruction. 
If the mind of the child be thus built up, as Herbart affirms, 
“entirely of presentations,” the question arises, is there in his 
scheme of psychology space left for the existence of individu- 
ality ? Or further, assuming that existence, is there any chance 
in the educated child of its development? As to its existence, 
we have seen that he held the mind has one original power 
—that of entering into relations with the external world. 
Granting this, he provided for the existence of individuality by 
implication. For that one power, varying in degree in different 
beings, is the sum of the mind’s potential energy. The special 
forms of dynamic force into which it will be converted, and 
which, active among the presentations, will, if permitted, select

    Introduction by the Translators. 35 
from among them those best suited to their nature, is Indiw- 
duality, i.e. the aptitudes of genius, inclinations, dispositions 
possessed by each human being, partly inherited, partly arising 
from that tendency to variation which is a law of the psychical, 
as well as of the physical world. Accepting then its existence, 
we may further ask, if the teacher’s work as Herbart under- 
stood it (i.e. the giving of presentations and the construction of 
the mind therefrom) and individuality are not mutually exclud- 
ing factors, which can never be multiplied into each other? 
They are only mutually excluding, he answers, if the teacher 
fails to perform his work aright. How he reconciles the two con- 
cepts, education and individuality, theoretically, is to be found 
in outline in the Allgemeine Pddagogik, and in detail in his psy- 
chological works. How he did soin practice, we learn from the 
Steiger letters. “The teacher,” says Herbart, “ ought to make 
it a point of honour to leave the individuality as untouched as 
possible”; he ought “ to leave to it the only glory of which it 
is capable, namely, to be sharply defined and recognisable even 
to conspicuousness, that the example of the race may not appear 
insignificant by the side of the race itself, and vanish as in- 
different.”+ Even from a lower standpoint the individuality 
will be respected by the teacher if he be wise, as a force which 
he must reckon with, and can use, since it will sometimes 
oppose, sometimes forward, his work. It plays an important 
part in deciding his point of departure. “It is the individu- 
ality and the horizon of the individual determined by opportu- 
nity, which decides, if not the central, at least the starting 
point of advancing culture.” 
So far as regards the teacher’s attitude towards individuality. 
How does 7 in its turn (and this is a question to Herbart of 
far-reaching importance) determine the nature and extent of 
the teacher’s work? “The mind of an adult, consisting of 
knowledge and imaginings, of resolves and doubts, of good, bad, 
strong, weak, conscious and unconscious opinions and inclina- 
tions, is put together differently in the cultured and uncultured 
  1 Allg, Pid., bk. 1, ch. ii. 8.

-P-A-G-E-56
  36 Science of Education. 
man, in Germans, Frenchmen, and Englishmen; how it is put 
together, the individuality of the man determines.”! Is the 
germ of this mind which the child unquestionably carries 
within him, the counterpart of the seed of the future plant? 
Must it develop to a predetermined form, as the seed of corn to 
wheat? Or does the development go on all through life with 
infinite possibilities of variation, and would the vegetable world 
supply a truer image of the growth of mind, and the work of 
the gardener be a truer picture of the work of the educator, 
were it possible for the former “to develop a lichen in the 
course of its growth into a grass, the grass again, into a plant, 
and the plant into a fruit tree?” * Unquestionably, Herbart 
answers, it would. For the child’s psychical part is not like 
the forms of the animal and vegetable world, his own body in- 
cluded. “If that mind be left to the play of chance, the latter 
sometimes builds, sometimes destroys; and the individual is at 
war with himself and his fellow creatures.”* Were the mind 
moving to an end predetermined in the germ, this could not 
be ; circumstances might favour or retard its growth, but not 
produce contradictions such as there are in men and society.+ 
Therefore this narrower conception, by which the teacher would 
be but a human gardener, and his work merely to surround the 
mind with conditions suitable to its predestined development, 
is to Herbart false. To the true educator, he maintains, is 
given a vaster and a nobler work, wiz. to penetrate the inner- 
most core of the mind-germ entrusted to his keeping; and 
leaving the better part of its individuality intact, to inoculate it 
with thoughts, feelings, desires, it could never otherwise have 
obtained. These, when absorbed into itself, will continuously 
help to guide and determine its aftergrowth.6 That Herbart 
should have formed this lofty conception of the work of edu- 
cation, and should have shown the way to its realisation in his 
life and writings, constitutes one of his chief claims to gratitude 
and recognition.

If, then, the mind be built up of presentations, and con- 
sequently is inherently neither good nor bad, but develops one 
way or the other, under external influences and the guidance of 
the teacher, it follows necessarily that what it receives in the 
form of presentations and their mode of combination, that is to 
say the work of education, is of infinite importance. It is, in 
Herbart’s own words, “ the formation of the circle of thought ” 
(Gedankenkreis), upon which depends the good, that is the en- 
lightened will—the source of the one and only aim of education 
—morality. His insistence on the circle of thought as the 
seat of the good will, and its result, the formation of a moral 
character, as the whole and sole end of the teacher’s work, and 
the strictly logical method by which on the basis of his psychology 
he showed the absolute dependence of the aim to be attained, 
upon the enlightenment of the will, is the greatest service which 
Herbart rendered to education. Morality depends on the good 
will, this again on the enlightenment of the whole man. 
Cultivate in the pupil this enlightenment, 7.e. a “ large and, in 
all its parts, interconnected circle of thought, which possesses 
the power of overcoming what is unfavourable in the environ- 
ment, as well as of dissolving and absorbing from it what is 
good,” for “ he only wields the full force of education who does 
so”} The fundamental thought and aim of the Pddagogtk is 
thus to aid the pupil to form his moral character by his own 
power—by “ ‘a making’ he himself discovers when choosing the 
good and rejecting the bad.”* “To place the power already 
existent and in its nature trustworthy under such conditions 
that it must surely and infallibly accomplish this rise,” is the 
work of the teacher, and the means to its accomplishment as 
elaborated in Herbart’s system of education are government, 
an educating instruction, and discipline. 
The function of government (Regierung) is to restrain the 
wild impetuosity of childhood, which cannot be called will, 
until such time as the true will which renders the human being

capable of self-determination can grow up in its place. To 
form this will, in other words to form the character, is the 
work of instruction (Unterricht) and discipline (Zucht) com- 
bined. Herbart’s doctrine of the foundation of the will has 
been excellently summarised by Professor Charles de Garmo as 
follows: ‘‘ Character-building is will-building. Will arises out 
of desire when coupled with a conviction of the possibility of 
its attainment. The representation in its strength and comple- 
tion is will. But along with every action of the will there is 
present in consciousness a mass of representations concerning 
motives, duties, considerations, etc., all of which together form 
a ‘picture’ of the will-action. When the will a second time has 
occasion to make a similar decision, this ‘ picture’ of the former 
action at once rises into consciousness. If the second deci- 
sion coincides with the first, the total representation is much 
strengthened and vivified. Later repetitions continue to deepen 
the impression. If now, upon a later occasion, a desire arises 
which contradicts and opposes the decisions already made, 
there at once begins a mental strife or struggle between the 
opposing representations, the old and established group which 
has been made strong and vivid by repeated actions of the will 
on the one side, and the new and opposing desire on the other. 
If the latter representation falls in with the former, the 
hindrance is removed, union takes place, and mental peace and 
comfort follow. If, on the contrary, the decision is opposed to 
previous right ones, the opposition remains, and a mental dis- 
comfort ensues, the highest degree of which is called remorse. 
Out of single acts of will, then, grows the more general will. 
Every new similar action strengthens the tendency already at 
hand. The memory of the will! or reproduction of the will- 
‘pictures’ becomes important in this consideration. If the 
reproduction is to be rapid and clear, the representations of 
which these pictures are composed must be intimately and 
strongly united. This would be the case, for example, when a 
will-action arises from energetic and thorough-going reflection. 
The latest series of representations, then, are examined by the 
1 Allg. Piidag., bk. 8, ch. i. 2.
-P-A-G-E-59
  Introduction by the Translators. 39 
apperception or synthesizing power of the mind, to see if they 
can be harmonized and united to the former. The result is a 
judgment on the matter out of which rises a command or pro- 
hibition. When such a judgment is extended so as to include 
not merely a single case, but a whole class of similar cases, we 
call it a practical principle of conduct, or maxim. It is the 
business of training (Zucht) to see that ail classes of will- 
action are brought under the dominion of moral maxims, in 
order that a ‘symmetrical passion for good’ may be created. 
‘Character is, in general, uniformity and fixedness of the whole 
of will.’ 
“Children have at first no real moral character. It arises 
gradually, and begins when here and there single moral volitions 
arise from the union of similar acts of will. These more 
general determinations of will-action, which through the ap- 
perception begin to accept or reject the new will-actions, form 
the beginning of the subjective side, or subjective foundations 
of character. Over against this stands the objective part, or 
the single will-act which results from a manifold of desire. 
The subjective part of character is that which determines; the 
objective part is that which is determined.” 
The immeasurable service Herbart rendered to education 
by the new light he threw on the laws of mind, indicates his 
distinct advance in one direction on his predecessors. Come- 
nius and Pestalozzi, insisting that education should follow 
the course of the child’s natural development and be based on 
the psychological laws of human nature, had advanced far in 
the same direction. But the knowledge of those laws in their 
day was too vague to allow of any but the most general expres- 
sion of the vital truth they saw and proclaimed. Herbart him- 
self made no pretension to possess a complete science of mind ; 
no one was more penetrated than he by the conviction that this 
science was in its earliest beginning, leaving an immeasurable 
field for future investigators.2 But his wide knowledge, his

ee 
power of analytic and abstract thought, and incorruptible love 
of truth enabled him to gain a more accurate insight into the 
origin and progress of mental activity, and with it the possi- 
bility of marking out a systematic course of education, which 
in the employment of definite means would attain sure results 
and compass its appointed end. 
Such a course of education, together with its means and 
their employment, is developed in the Allgemeine Pddagogtk. 
The system of education it contains is, as the title of the 
book sets forth, deduced from its aim—morality, which in 
the Aesthetische Darstellung Herbart presents as the highest 
aim of humanity, and consequently of education. The two 
works therefore are translated, the Allgemeine Pddagogik fol- 
lowing the Darstellung in fitting sequence as its logical out- 
come. Indeed, Herbart himself urges on the reader a com- 
parison of the two works ;1 it is one of great value not only 
intrinsically, but because it affords a striking instance of the 
integrity and the constant striving towards perfection of his 
thought. 
The reader can hardly fail to notice, that while the aim of 
education in the Darstellung and the Allg. Pédag. is one and the 
same, the means by which it is to be attained have received a 
new setting in the latter work. In the former, the aim of edu- 
cation is defined as Morality :—that is, a will steadfast in obedi- 
ence to the commands of a taste founded on the relationships 
of will. Hence arises the teacher’s twofold task; on the one 
hand, to cultivate that taste and make it a power in the soul, 
which is accomplished by the esthetic revelation of the world 
given through instruction; ahd, on the other hand, to enable 
the will to change its direction, in accordance with its standard 
of taste,> which is effected by the awakening of manifold 
desires (Verlangen) held in check and turned into right direc- 
tions by discipline.* The form of the Darstellung is strictly 
deductive, passing from the aim to its postulates, and thence

Introduction by the Translators. 41 
to the means of their attainment. But Herbart could not con- 
ceal from himself, that in this conception of the work of educa- 
tion, instruction was limited to the cultivation of taste, although 
to taste in the widest sense of the term; and not all the parts 
of instruction were exhibited in their true light. There are 
indications! that he felt that the independent value of a general 
culture to be secured by instruction had not been sufficiently esti- 
mated, and the problem of cultivation as such occupied his 
thoughts then and afterwards. The influence of his psychologi- 
cal studies now asserted itself more distinctly in the Allg. Piadag. 
His Psychology, as we have seen, abolished all separation be- 
tween understanding and will, reason and impulse, and con- 
structed the mind entirely out of presentations.2, The sum of 
the presentations constitutes the “sphere of thought” in which 
feeling and willing also have their abode. In conformity with 
this, the task of education is now in the Allg. Pididag. conceived to 
be the determination of the circle of thought, and this in such a 
way that from it a will conformable to insight may arise. This 
conception receives its true force if we add, that the determin- 
ation of the circle of thought is not to be effected (as in the 
Darstellung) by the awakening of a manifold desire or a mani- 
fold love, but by the animation of a many-sided and balanced 
interest. This, in the Allg. Pddag. is the task of instruction, 
by whose side discipline now only stands as supporter, giving

2 The man is driven by no other mechanism than that created out of the 
presentations which he receives and understands. These presentations 
themselves are powers which now restrain, now aid, each other; they are 
powers which rise and rush, throng and liberate themselves, and through 
this warfare fall into all the manifold conditions which we bya far too 
general and vague term call Will. What is not contained in this expression 
will ? inclination, desire, fear, courage, choice, caprice, resolution, reflection, 
good will that knows not what is good, bad will which imagines it is good, 
insight without resolution, resolution without strength, horror at the crime 
which is in the same moment deliberately perpetrated—and all the rest of 
the phenomena which in their wonderful mixture and separation, their con- 
tinuous, incessant changing and new formations put to the blush and de- 
stroy at every moment adl divisions made by philosophers between under- 
standing and willing, reason and arbitrariness, impulse and freedom.—

strength to the character whose adjustment has been provided 
for by instruction. Herbart was the first clearly to conceive 
the idea of an educating instruction, i.e. one having a moral 
aim, and hence, to place instruction as a whole in connection 
with the final aim of all education, deducing a plan embracing 
it in its totality from that aim. The later conception is in no 
wise inconsistent with the meaning of the earlier. To set up 
morality and to cultivate a moral character have an interchange- 
able meaning. The “idea of God” of the Darstellung is com- 
mensurate with the “end of nature” of the Péddagogik; the 
“empirical interest ” of the Pddagogik is directed to “ teleologi- 
cal inquiry ”; the “speculative ”’ led to the idea of Providence. 
Religion must be so cultivated that “it may find the discord 
unbearable arising from a world without moral order,” while 
sympathy with humanity must lead to “ the recognition of its 
dependence.” But in the Pidagogik instruction takes a more 
proportionate place, and is referred, with greater emphasis, to a 
psychological basis, while in the Darstellung ethical considera- 
tions preponderate. 
The ideal tendency which education receives from ethics is 
brought out into stronger relief in the Darstellung than in any 
of Herbart’s after works, though its main thought—that the 
harmonious working together of all elements in the mind can 
alone insure the enduring strength of morality—underlies, as 
we have seen, the whole of the Pidagogik. The germs of the 
ideas afterwards to be fully developed in the Darstellung may 
be found in Herbart’s letters before-mentioned to Herr von 
Steiger. In the fourth letter of the series he is busied in the 
case of his pupil Ludwig, with the problem of how “ to give an 
equipoise to a nature predisposed to egotism without injuring 
its activity, by placing a picture drawn in true and sharp out- 
lines of what humanity can and ought to be, that the effort to 
live in conformity to his insight may be aroused in the boy.” 
In the “circumspect morality, exerting insight and imagin- 
ation” of the third letter, the aim of the Darstellung is ex- 
pressed. And the formation of character which is to be the 
joint work of teacher and pupil in the fourth letter is the same 
in its essential point—the relative activity of teacher and

  pupil—as that which in the Darstellung is to be “the chief work 
of education.” In the former the teacher is to exhibit the 
‘course of the moral development of humanity ” in such a way 
that the boy may be led to “correctly form and pronounce on 
its varied phases his own approving and disapproving judgment, 
and thus learn to shape his own principles.” In the latter it 
is the teacher’s task ‘‘ to place the trustworthy power existent 
in the mind of the pupil in the midst of such conditions that it 
must inevitably effect the rise to self-conscious personality,” 
while it is the pupil’s part to form his character through “ ‘a 
making’ he himself discovers in choosing the good and rejecting 
the bad.” The main thought of the Darstellung is but another 
expression of the principle Herbart arrived at when, as a young 
man of twenty-one, he was in the midst of his first year of 
active work as teacher—the principle “ that no human faculty 
ought to be crippled, but should advance to good under the 
protection and gentle rule of the moral law.” This harmony 
in all he wrote, and, as his life bears witness, in all he did, is 
intensely characteristic of the man. Not only do we find it in 
the Letters and the Darstellung, which are separated from each 
other by a period of seven years—a most important period in 
Herbart’s mental growth, during which his practical philosophy, 
whose main features were first given in the Darstellung, shaped 
itself; it is quite as noticeable in the Allg. Padag., and in his 
last important work, Umriss pidagogischer Vorlesungen, a sup- 
plement to the Allg. Piéidag. written seven years before his death. 
It was an intense belief in, and love for, the human nature to 
be educated, and an enthusiasm for the teacher’s work growing 
out of his own lofty conception of it, which gave this funda- 
mental unity to his life and thought. 
There seems to be a general consensus of opinion among 
German scholars as to the beauty of Herbart’s style. Bartolo- 
mai, one of his most accurate and sympathetic expositors, 
writes: ‘‘No philosopher has surpassed Herbart in the 
lucidity of his classic style, or paid more devoted homage to 
the genius of the German language.” Jean Paul Richter, in 
the preface to Levana, while agreeing in the main with Barto- 
lomai, pointed out the peculiar difficulty of the Allg. Pddag.

“The exquisite and alluring language,’ he writes, “ cannot 
suppress the wish that Herbart had not made use of the title- 
privilege ‘ general’ so generally, since the reader is necessarily 
left to fill up the too wide formulas for himself. When, how- 
ever, Herbart desires to strengthen the muscles, and stretch 
the bowstring of the character, he becomes circumstantial 
enough, and with good reason, for his language and his 
thoughts reveal a character peculiarly his own.” The following 
analyses of the Darstellung and the Allgemeine Paidagogik may 
be found useful as a preliminary to the translation, but the 
reader will soon discover for himself, that nothing but a con- 
centrated effort of thought, patient study of the teacher’s 
fundamental principles, and complete mastery of his technology, 
will enable him to appreciate the power or value of either 
work. 
Tue AlstHeTIC REVELATION OF THE Wort as the chief work 
of education, published in 1804 when Herbart was twenty-eight 
years old, although complete in itself, was added to the second 
edition of his work entitled Pestalozzi’s Idee eines A B O der 
Anschawung, as an extension of the latter. Proceeding from 
morality as the highest aim of humanity, and consequently of 
education, the essence of formation of character is defined as 
“a making’ which the pupil himself discovers when choosing 
the good and rejecting the bad.” ‘This rise to self-conscious 
personality must take place in the mind of the pupil himself, 
and be perfected by his own exertion. To place the power 
already existent, and in its nature trustworthy, in the midst of 
such conditions that it must infallibly effect this rise, is what 
the teacher must conceive as possible—while he must consider 
the great work for all his efforts is to reach, understand, and 
guide that power. 
The first predicate of right willing is obedience. But not 
every obedience to the first chance command is moral. The in- 
dividual obeying must have examined and chosen the command, 
he himself must have placed it in its position of command. 
The moral is its own authority. Not that it comes forth as 
originating a decisive judgment, for the moral being is essen-

tially humble, but as finding an antecedent necessity. This 
necessity can be neither logical nor moral, since every ‘“‘ must ”’ 
is excluded, and the question here is only of original necessity, 
which does not become moral necessity till it governs obedience 
in opposition to inclination. 
Therefore only esthetic necessity remains, the characteristic 
of which is that it speaks in purely absolute judgments entirely 
without proof, moreover without using compulsion to enforce 
its claim, It takes no account of inclination, neither gratifying 
nor restraining it; and arises on the complete presentation of 
its object. With a multitude of objects, there is a correspond- 
ing number of original judgments which are not linked to- 
gether so as to be logically deducible from each other. At the 
most, after exclusion of all that is incidental in various objects, 
analogous relations will be found, and these will generate 
analogous judgments. As far as we know the simple esthetic 
relations, we have simple judgments of them. It is important 
that these judgments should never require the actuality of 
their object. Only when that object becomes existent and 
permanent, is the judgment which announces what it should 
be, steadfast also. And through this steadfastness, it becomes 
to the human being who cannot escape it the most inexorable 
necessity; it is its slow constraining force which we call con- 
science. 
If we consider will in the simplest conceivable relationships, 
arising from its action on itself, on other wills or on material 
objects, an original, absolute, independent, esthetic judgment of 
a particular nature, and with direct evidence, will be formed on 
each of these relationships. From the judgments so received, » 
plan of life must be afterwards formed. ‘This is effected }. 
discipline, which is necessarily a preparation for the esthe:.. 
revelation of the world. ‘Through it freedom is given an! 
obtained to alter the direction of will, of desire; that is, the 
power of adhering to one inclination until another is ready to 
assert itself. At this point all turns on the question whether 
egotism or practical’ reason will take possession of this free-

-P-A-G-E-66
  46 Science of Education. 
dom; if Egotism, it will become Worldly Wisdom ; if Practical 
Reason, it will become Morality. 
Which it shall become ought to be no open question, if the 
teacher has done his part. If he begins his work aright, he 
can, by the esthetic revelation of the world, determine the 
boy’s perception so early and so powerfully, that the free 
bearing of the mind will receive its law, not from worldly 
wisdom, but from pure practical reflection. ‘ Such a revela- 
tion of the world—the whole known world, and all known 
times, obliterating if necessary the bad effect of undesirable 
surroundings—this may with justice be called the chief work 
of education.” ! 
The first necessity for such a revelation is a perfect family 
life; upon which, in all its dignity and purity, the child in its 
midst can look with his ingenuous eyes. From thence educa- 
tion moves forth in a twofold course—outwards and upwards. 
Upwards, since in the perfect family life we find the most 
perfect earthly expression of the Divine, there is but one step 
possible, the step to the supersensuous world—to God. In a 
passage of great beauty, remarkable for its forcible language 
and sublime thought, the idea of God is exhibited in its abso- 
lute unconditioned perfection, and in the life of man bounded 
by the limits of consciousness alone. But if this idea is to 
maintain in the future its rightful place in the mind of the 
man, it must not be forced too early, or too persistently, upon 
the immature mind of the child. There it must be gradually 
and indirectly fostered by means of a double contrast; first 
between the Homeric characters and the child’s relations whom 
he honours and loves, and secondly between the polytheism of 
Homer and the Providence whose image the child will fashion 
for himself in the likeness of his parents. This contrast natur- 
ally leads to the second,—the outward course of education, that 
is, the course of the progressive revelation of the world. This 
is given along the two lines of instruction, knowledge and sym- 
pathy ; which, guided by instruction, continue to run on side 
by side, till they find their meeting-place at last in God.

Toe GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF THE SCIENCE OF EDUCATION ap- 
peared in 1806, while Herbart was at Gottingen. His philo- 
sophical studies and work as teacher, not only in Switzerland, 
but in Bremen and Gottingen, to which he owed his 
“little collection” as he called it, of carefully arranged 
observations and experiments collected on a variety of oc- 
casions,! provided him with ample material, both theoretical 
and practical. He tells us “the plan of the Piéidagogik was, 
after practical use, thought over carefully in all its details 
many years before pen was put to paper towards the end of 
the year 1805.” The book is dedicated to his old and true 
friend Senator Schmidt, and the letter accompanying the pre- 
sentation copy runs as follows: ‘My dear Schmidt, you will 
find yourself godfather here to a late-born child, which you saw 
six years ago as an embryo, and which would not now have 
seen the light, had I not been impelled to finish it by the wish, 
that my two able pupils, Counts Sievers and Platers, should 
take home this conclusion of their work. The hurry of its com- 
pletion compels me to request that you will overlook omissions 
in the final correction, and be content with a tolerable state- 
ment of the main concepts.” Herbart himself wrote the first 
notice of the work for the Gottingen paper, containing hints 
to readers and an explanation of its plan. From its title 
Pedagogy Deduced from its Aim, a strictly deductive method of 
treatment, like that of the Darstellung, might have been and 
was expected. But while many-sidedness of interest as the 
work of instruction, and moral strength of character as the 
work of discipline are rightly placed side by side, a section 
devoted to formation of character, of virtue as a whole—which 
ought to have preceded any explanation of those concepts that 
signify the two parts of education—is not given till near the 
end. By exhibiting the work of instruction and discipline as 
following, not from the fundamental thought of the book, i.e. 
formation of a moral character, but from consideration of “ pos- 
sible and necessary aims” ? that fundamental thought is still

-P-A-G-E-68
  48 Science of Education. 
  further thrust into the background; and instruction and disci- 
pline are not brought back to it—the concept from which they 
are actually deduced—till near the end, the fourth chapter of 
the third book. Not till that point does Richter’s praise, given 
in Levana, become applicable. Herbart, in the notice of the 
Allgemeine Pédagogik before referred to, wrote, “the peda- 
gogy in question has by no means the proud wish to pass 
for a speculative work of art. It asks those who read it 
through from beginning to end, to re-read it once more 
from end to beginning, when the innermost connection of 
the work of education differentiated in the concepts will 
appear more conspicuously than the headings would lead 
the reader to suppose possible.” By the hint thus given, Her- 
bart tried to guard his readers from confusing the collateral 
aims with the chief one—formation of character—which oc- 
cupies its true position of precedence in the re-reading he 
recommends. He seems to have taken this departure from the 
strictly deductive method out of consideration for the teacher, 
who, confronted by a multitude of means, mainly requires to 
have, as it were, a bird’s-eye view of them all; he hoped “ the 
disadvantage that the concepts which served as headings to 
the chapters had to do double duty as principles, would not be 
felt by the attentive reader.” A synthetical and analytical 
method of division, like that he used in the Psychologie als Wis- 
senschaft, would have removed all difficulties, but he does not 
seem to have adopted it, partly out of regard for symmetry of 
form. 
We have seen that Herbart founded his pedagogy on ethics 
and psychology, the former supplying the aim of education, 
the latter the means thereto. On its ethical side, pedagogy is 
purely speculative; but on its psychological side it must take 
counsel with experience. Viewed, then, in relation to ethics, it is 
a science (that which is known); in its relation to psychology 
—to experience, it is an art (that which is done). Education 
as an art is classified as government, instruction, and dis- 
cipline. 
The highest and the ne tion is morality. 
But the boy when grown to manhood will set other aims 
   
-P-A-G-E-69

  beside this before himself; therefore the teacher must consider 
not only the necessary, but these other possible aims of his 
pupil also—aims which will answer to his talents, disposi- 
tions, and inclinations. Since the teacher cannot know what 
these aims will be, he must qualify the pupil to attain them by 
preparing inward power, and this can only be done by giving 
a general stimulus to the mind. 
The starting point of education is individuality—what the _ 
“be repeated for in them lies the strength of individuality, 
which is to be maintained as unimpaired as possible, that the 
child may not become a mere type of the race. 
The sole object of government, “hid WIM Pounder it thes 
is to create order and keep the child within bounds; it there- 
fore deals with the present alone. Authority and. ‘love support 
its measures, “which are occupation, supervision, threatening 
and punishment. These must gradually be made dispensable 
and then withdrawn. 
Instruction, the second division of education, is the most 
important. Education must determine the will towards virtwe— 
(that is, it must insure its contormt i 
the ethical ideas). But both will and wisdom have their roots 
“in the circle-efthought, that is to say, in the combination and 
co-operative activity of the presentations acquired, and the 
true cultivation of that circle instruction alone can give. The 
more immediate aim of instruction on its way to its ultimate 
aim is a balanced, many-sided interest; that is, an intellectual 
activity prompted by instruction, and directed towards many 
objects, in which no single effort preponderates, but all are as 
far as possible of equal strength. Interest as such depends im- 
mediately upon its object, and is thereby differentiated from 
desire, which strives towards something in the future. When 
the mind becomes concentrated on the future more than the 
present, interest passes into desire. Observation and expecta- 
tion are conditions of interest, demand and action of desire. 
Alternate acts of concentration and reflection! are necessary to 
  -

  50 Science of Education. 
  the production of many-sidedness. The former, i.e. the tem- 
porary concentrated absorption in an object, must be followed 
by the latter, i.e. the collecting and combining of the presen- 
tations brought clearly and distinctly into consciousness by 
concentration. For many-sidedness, numerous concentrations 
on varied subjects are necessary, with which, however, reflec- 
tion must alternate, that one-sidedness, absence of mind, doubt, 
etc.,may be avoided. Quiescent concentration, which purifies 
the presentations from confusing elements, creates clearness; 
the progress from one concentration to another produces as- 
sociation of the presentations; quiescent reflection, which is 
directed to the various parts of association, creates order and 
system ; and finally, the progress of reflection, which applies 
what is systematised and pursues it further, is method. These 
are the four formal steps of instruction. 
Interest, whose object is to create a many-sided activity, is 
directed first to the natural already existent presentations, 1.e. 
those which have been given by experience and intercourse. 
Since experience leads to knowledge of nature, and intercourse 
to the disposition towards human beings (sympathy), instruc- 
tion must be brought to bear on both in order that it may 
correct and complete them. 
Knowledge and Sympathy, as the two primary divisions of 
interest, can be directed to various objects: knowledge, to the 
multiplicity of phenomena in nature, or to their conformity to 
law, or to their esthetic relationships ; sympathy, to individuals, 
to society, or to the relation of all to the highest Being. Thus 
the six following classes of interest are formed :— 
In Knowledge. In Sympathy. 
Empirical interest. Sympathetic interest. 
Speculative _,, Social 9s 
AXsthetic mM 3 Religious = 
To place all in balanced action is to create the perfect many- 
sided culture of the mind. 
The sciences contain the materials for instruction. If they 
are to be used, it is not enough merely to know their terminology;

what is homogeneous in the different branches must be empha- 
sized, and this can be done under the terms Symbols, Forms, 
Things. Symbols, for instance languages, arouse interest only 
as the means of revealing what they express. For that reason 
they are in themselves felt to be wearisome, and, in the be- 
ginning of instruction, their use ought to be limited to their 
necessity for the next interesting work. Forms also, the single 
properties of things obtained by abstraction and considered 
separately, do not arouse direct interest, and therefore must 
be treated only in connection with the actual. Finally, things— 
works of nature and of art —excite direct interest. But things 
are nothing more than the combination of properties which we 
take out by the process of abstraction, therefore we can either 
proceed from the single properties to the things in which they 
are combined, or begin with the things and analyse them into 
their properties. 
he/course of instruction ¥s determined accordingly. It will 
be an it separates and dissects, moreover 
corrects and completes ; in it the chief work will fall on the 
pupil. . Or it will be synthetical in so far as the elements are 
given and combined; in this the teacher will determine the 
order of connection. ,Both analytical and synthetical instruc- 
tion are classified in conformity with the six classes of interest, 
and the two must mutually support each other. Instruction

first is productive of Clearness, the second of Association, the 
third leads to System, the last to Method. In matters apper- 
taining to sympathy, instruction’ is observing, continuous, 
elevating, active in the sphere of reality. And these condi- 
tions are again in like manner productive in order of clearness, 
association, system, and method. 
Discipline, the third division of education, consists in direct 
accomplished, however, by merely exciting the feelings. Through 
the influence of discipline, the circle of thought itself must 
receive additions, and the desires be transformed into action. 
Therefore its work is indirect, so far as it prepares the way for 
instruction to determine the circle of thought, and direct so 
      
    
 
-P-A-G-E-72
ce ea a ee RE el) eee ee, See Ty ee Be ee ee ee, ee 
52 Science of Education. 
  far as it transforms the contents of that circle into action, and 
thus lays the foundation of character. The aim of discipline is 
moral strength of character, that is steafffastness in ] rogress to” 
virtue. Character consists in uniform rmness of will, 
and these as exhibited both in what the man will, and what he 
will not. 
There is an essential distinction between the objective and 
subjective sides of character. The former is the seat of the 
will, existent in the individual before self-observation began, 
directed to what he bears willingly or unwillingly, what he 
longs to have or to do; the latter is the seat of the new will 
growing up as a result of self-observation, which crystallises 
itself by degrees into general concepts, partly from antecedent 
homogeneous acts of willing, partly from the requirements it 
makes on itself in regard to the kind of willing. Through 
memory of the will, that is, through uniformity of willing, the 
objective part of the character comes into harmony with itself. 
Then in the want of accord between what he would endure, 
have, and pursue, the pupil is confronted with the choice be- 
tween them, which helps to determine the character. Resolu- 
tions, maxims, principles are formed in riper years, when the 
subjective character develops, and since that process involves 
subsumptions, conclusions, and motives, it cannot, if the motives 
are to be worth anything, take place without struggle. Strength 
of character depends on the agreement between the two sides 
of the character. ‘he good resolves belonging to the subjective 
side which require esthetic judgment, enthusiasm for the good, 
and, to make them into moral resolutions, logical culture as 
well as systematic combination and continuous employment, 
must meet what is praiseworthy in the objective part of the 
character, that what is bad may be excluded. 
The attitude which the teacher assumes towards the pupil is 
the most important aid to discipline—his expressed satisfaction 
or dissatisfaction, freedom granted or restraint imposed, etc.— 
throughout which, the pupil’s susceptibility is to be observed, 
made use of carefally, and not over-stimulated. 
The book on discipline closes with suggestions as to its 
method of procedure. It is the formation of character by the

light of psychology. Special stress is laid on the importance of 
-keeping the mind as g whole tranquil and clear, so that the 
ssthetic judgments may form, and the character become moral. 
In proportion as the pupil has gained trust in his opinions and 
principles, discipline must retreat and allow room for self-edu- 
cation. 
The reader will perceive from the foregoing that Herbart 
includes in the circle of thought, the whole of human experience, 
subjective and objective—whether from within or without. 
His principle, that morality is based on the circle of thought, 
and that in widening that circle and awakening interest all 
true education lies, receives a striking illustration in the hfe 
and teaching of Jesus. The main thought of Jesus’ life, the 
one he said he came into the world to teach, z.e. the Father- 
hood of God, was the greatest widening of the circle of thought 
and interest the world has experienced, and the one most pro- 
ductive of successive, ever widening circles. Being a new 
concept introduced into the mental horizon of humanity, and 
affecting as it did the relationships between men themselves and 
their God, it altered the whole aspect of life. As the circle 
of thought and interest has been expanded, one evil after 
another has passed away. In the history of the world it has 
been ever thus. Men must first have light, to see good and 
evil, before they cancleave to the one and eschew the other. 
Light ultimately is choice. When men saw that burning 
witches at the stake was wrong, they ceased to do it. 
The basis of Herbart’s system of ethics is neither transcen- 
dental nor supernatural. Its ultimate ground is what he calls 
the esthetic judgments, which, as applied to ethics, and not to 
the sphere of taste where he also recognises and traces their 
action, are the perceptions present in every human soul that to 
it individually right and wrong are inconvertible terms. The 
standard—that which education offers—varies with the changing 
conditions of humanity. The theft, which, if he had sufficient 
skill to conceal from his victim, was honoured as a virtue in the 
Spartan boy, was forbidden by the barbaric code of Jewish 
morality, and condemned by the golden rule of Confucius and
-P-A-G-E-74
  54 Science of Education. 
Jesus, but under both the act and the abstinence from it was 
the same consciousness of the mind pronouncing to itself the 
distinction for it between right and wrong. On this conscious- 
ness, as on a rock which could withstand all storms because it 
is an integral part of human nature, and therefore as inde- 
structible as that nature itself, not on any revelation, religion, 
or law external to the individual, Herbart based his morality, 
and in so doing opened out illimitable possibilities to education. 
To him, in the words of a great living theologian, this conscious- 
ness, the moral faculty, was “ not any apprehension of invisible 
qualities in external actions, not any partition of them into the 
absolutely good or the absolutely evil, not any intellectual 
testing of them by rules of congruity or balances of utility, but 
a recognition at their very source of a scale of relative values 
lying within ourselves, and introducing a preferential character 
throughout the countless combinations of our possible activity.””} 
In building up the character through the circle of thought on 
this foundation, Herbart endeavours to ensure that morality 
shall penetrate all parts of the mind and heart—that under a 
rightly directed, all-embracing education, the whole of the 
character, not merely one side of it, shall be permeated and 
impelled by moral force. The very prevalent belief, that in- 
struction ought to be confined to the intellectual side of 
human nature, and that the foundation of virtue is transcen- 
dental, its basis an external objective law, a law written on 
tables of stone instead of a law written on the heart, has 
hindered the accomplishment of this aim. The first error made 
men piecemeal moral, the second fostered growth from without 
inwards, instead of from within outwards. Both are at variance 
with Herbart’s idea of moral development. With him the pro- 
cess is a slow and natural one, begun in earliest childhood ; in 
his language it is the gradual triumph of the subjective over what 
is bad in the objective will, and “conversion” begins with the 
cradle and ends at the grave. Thus Herbart’s two main aims, 
a perfect education and a morality based on an indestructible 
foundation, necessarily complete each other; for he places that 
1 The Seat of Authority in Religion, Dr. Martineau. 
 
-P-A-G-E-75
Introduction by the Translators. 55 
morality in the very texture of the mind itself, which must be 
destroyed before the moral can cease to exist, and contends that 
education, rightly carried out on psychological principles, will 
enable each pupil to determine his own character in this moral 
direction. Either without the other is incomplete, for virtue is 
the true end of all education, and education is necessary to the 
perfection of virtue in the individual, 
An attentive study of Herbart reveals how these two aims 
successively developed in his mind, and how underlying both, 
although unseen, is the foundation stone of certitude. Not that 
Herbart claimed finality or perfection for his method of educa- 
tion, though he did so by implication for his principle of moral- 
ity. Butthe necessity of certitude in both is implied as part of 
any perfected system of education and ethics. a 
Herbart was no pessimist; he had faith in human nature, 
and believed in its cumulative power of self-regeneration 
through self-culture. ‘‘ Humanity,” he reiterates, “educates 
itself continuously by the circle of thought which it begets.” 
He saw, and was probably the first to do so, clearly three things 
and their intimate connection: first, that there can be but one 
right method of education, and its foundation is psychology ; 
secondly, that this method is infallible, can and must claim for 
itself certitude; and thirdly, that virtue, the end and aim of 
all education and life, has an impregnable basis in the human 
mind, and can claim for itself certitude also. An optimistic 
view of life demands this. The right education alone is infal- 
lible, it must compass its aim; failure to do this only proves it 
is not the right education, and is not founded on psychology. Its 
aim, the only true morality, is infallible also, for it is founded 
on the mind’s intuitive judgments. Hither the world is capable 
of rising, by means of self-culture, to virtue, or itis not. Herbart 
claims it can do so, and virtually that it must—that there is 
a right method of education by which men not only can, but 
must attain virtue, so that in process of time the human race 
thus trained must of necessity advance in perfection. In this 
way alone can we have surety that evil will diminish. In a 
word, men rightly educated must certainly attain virtue, a 
virtue whose germ is an integral part of, and therefore as 
 
-P-A-G-E-76

  indestructible as, the mind itself. This is Herbart’s optimistic 
view of the future of humanity to be reached by education. 
Of him, in truth, it may be said,— 
‘** God has conceded two sights to a man— 
One of men’s whole work, time’s completed plan ; 
The other of the minute’s work, man’s first 
Step to the plan’s completion.” —Sordello.—R. Brownina. 
And as such he speaks to teachers, to those who, in the faith 
in human progress which inspired his life, are fashioning the 
minds of the coming generation, and are ready to welcome any 
new light. He speaks to thinkers, to those who meditate on 
the problem of existence, and seek to penetrate through that 
which is ever becoming but never is, to the underlying unity. 
And finally he speaks to the religious, to those who, seeing 
religious systems of the past and present rise and fall as 
growths of time and place, having no final claim on the minds 
of men, can abide by the words of the greatest of all teachers: 
“the kingdom of heaven is within you,” and found their faith 
as Herbart did, on the eternal nature of love and duty, God’s 
ever present witnesses in the soul of man. To the thoughtful 
study of such, we commend him in his own words, spoken in 
memory of his great predecessor Kant, in the University where 
both laboured and taught : 
“Centuries pass away, taking with them the great men they 
have brought to us. All traces of them vanish, if not held fast 
in sacred remembrance. What the mind of the individual can 
effect depends on the receptivity of the many, who do or do not 
come forth to meet him. How long that influence will endure 
depends on its recollection, development and use in the circle 
of the living. Whether the picture of the dead shall be re- 
ceived true and clear, or falsified and distorted by ages to 
come, depends upon the witness which his contemporaries give 
or transmit of him. For the grave by itself is cold and dumb; 
it only finds a voice when speech is lent to it by loving hearts.”

ON THE ASTHETIC REVELATION OF THE WORLD 
AS THE CHIEF WORK OF EDUCATION. 
By JoHAaNnN FRIEDRICH HERBART. 
THE one and the whole work of education may be summed up 
in the concept—Morality. 
We might assume as many problems for education as there 
are permissible aims for men. But then, this would involve as 
many educational researches as problems, which would have to 
be carried on irrespective of their mutual relationships, and it 
could not be seen how the teacher’s separate measures are to be 
limited, or in what way they might be carried out. Weshould 
find ourselves much too poor in means, if we tried to attain 
every individual aim directly, and that which we intended only 
to effect singly, might have tenfold results from secondary and 
accidental causes, so that all parts of the work would be thrown 
out of their right proportions. This point of view is thus 
unsuitable for approaching the consideration of educational 
questions as a connected whole. If it is to be possible to think 
out thoroughly and accurately, and to carry out systematically 
the business of education as asingle whole, it must be previously 
possible to comprehend the work of education also as but one. 
Morality is universally acknowledged as the highest aim of 
humanity, and consequently of education. Whoever denies this 
can certainly have no true knowledge of what morality is; at 
least, he has no right to speak in this place. But to set up 
morality as the whole aim of humanity and education, an expan- 
sion of the concept (t.e. of morality) is required, as is also a 
proof of its necessary presumptions as conditions of its real 
possibility. 
The good will—the steady resolution of a man to consider 
himself as an individual under the law which is universally bind- 
ing—is the ordinary, and rightly the first thought which the 
67

word morality suggests.1_ If we think of the power, and the 
resistance as well, with which a human being maintains this 
good will erect in himself against those movements of the 
emotions and desires working in opposition to it, then morality, 
which was merely an attribute, a determination of the will, be- 
comes to us the virtue, power, action, and efficacy of the will so 
determined. Distinct from both is what belongs to legality, 
i.e. the right comprehension of the moral law, and different again 
from the knowledge of the general law, and even of the know- 
ledge of ordinary and recognized rules of duty in common life, 
is the proper judgment by the individual of that which in 
special cases, in particular moments, in his immediate contact 
with human beings and destiny, is to be done, chosen, or 
avoided, as the best, as the true and only good. All this philo- 
sophy finds immediately in the concept, and expects, nay even 
requires it just as immediately from man as an expression of 
freedom. 
Can the teacher make a beginning with this mode of looking 
at the concept as it stands? 
Granted that we are speaking of moral culture only in the 
narrowest sense of the word, stripping from it everything 
scientific, all training, all strengthening of mental and physical 
energy as far as we think possible, and reserving that for con- 
sideration elsewhere, we have to ask, is that which presents 
itself to the philosopher’s mind when putting before himself 
only the bare concept of morality, given to the teacher also? 
Does he too find the good will present, so that he needs only to 
direct it against the inclinations, needs only to indicate the 
right objects by exposition of the moral? Does the ‘“ intel- 
ligible source” ® possibly flow for him also? May he also draw 
in comfort from heaven the stream whose origin he does not 
1 Note by Herbart.—‘ This is so since Kant. There is nothing conceiv- 
able in all the world, or indeed outside of it, which can be accepted as good 
without limitation, except alone a good will, The good will is good, not 
through that which it effectuates or does, or through its fitness to attain a 
prescribed aim, but solely in virtue of the willing, i.e. it is good in itself.” 
—(From the preface to the Grundlegung zur Metaphysik der Sitten).

know? In a disciple of our new systems indeed, nothing is 
more logical than calmly to expect that the radical good—or 
perhaps also, the radical bad—will express itself quite spon- 
taneously in his pupil, nothing more logical than to quietly 
respect the freedom which he must presuppose in his pupil as 
a human being, his only care being not to interfere with it by 
any misdirected effort on his own part (out of which arises the 
question, can freedom, as a matter of fact, be interfered with?). 
Thus he will give up entirely the most important part of his 
business, and finally limit his whole care to the presenting of 
pieces of information. Something similar has been actually 
affirmed in all seriousness by a disciple of those systems. 
But we must not be so exacting in the application of these 
theories. They would break down in the very beginning 
under the weight of such a logic. We may hope that the 
first transcendental philosopher who is interested in educa- 
tion will be able to show an appropriate basis for it. The 
postulate? that education must be possible will first be endowed 
with a valid title; then there will be room enough in the 
sensuous world; and, for all those who have anything to do 
therein the realistic view stands good. In the same way as 
freedom can reveal itself through its verdict, “the moral law ”’ 
as equivalent to cause in the realm of phenomena, it will be also 
conceded that the sensuous world as systematised by the 
teacher will appear as influencing the pupil’s freedom, and this 
suffices. Now we have found our field, though certainly not yet 
our rules of procedure ; but while the teacher will discover them 
to begin with, the transcendental philosopher will know how 
to deduce them afterwards from his system. 
To the teacher morality is a “taking place,” a natural event, 
* Schopenhauer afterwards, in the Fundamental Problems of Ethics (1841), 
carried the doctrine of Kant to this point. 
2 Postulates are, according to Kant, theoretical, but as such, not demon- 
strable propositions so far as they inseparably depend on an a priori practi- 
cal law of unlimited authority. The moral fundamental principle is a law 
on which rest the postulates of freedom, of the immortality of the human 
soul, and of the existence of God. 
Herbart’s ironical remark about the art of derivation is directed not so 
much against Kant, as against his short-sighted disciples. 
 
-P-A-G-E-80

which we may assume has already been seen incidentally in 
isolated moments in a small part of his pupil’s soul, but which 
should act and continue to act in the entire circuit of the 
character, and absorb and change into parts of itself all the 
remaining events, thoughts, imaginations, inclinations and de- 
sires. In such a perfect form as this, that natural event ought 
to take place, with the entire sum of the pupil’s mental power ; 
in the imperfect form in which it actually takes place, the good 
will has each time—or rather every act of good willing is—a 
defined sum of activity, a defined part of the whole, and in- 
deed exists thus defined and in such a degree for the particular 
moment only. With time, however, the sum grows, diminishes, 
disappears, becomes negative (as in the case of a crooked line), 
grows again, and all this we can observe in so far as the pupil 
expresses himself openly. 
In the entire determination with which this takes place, it 
does so of necessity as an inevitable effect of certain mental 
causes, just as necessarily as every effect in the material world, 
only not in any way according to material laws (e.g. of weight, 
impact, etc.), which latter have not the remotest similarity with 
those of mental operations, The teacher, like the astronomer, 
takes courage to attempt to investigate the conformity to law 
of the phenomena before him, by a right interrogation of nature 
and exact inferences sufficiently multiplied, and thus to discover 
likewise how they may be modified conformably to aim and 
plan. These realistic views do not tolerate the smallest mixture 
of the idealistic. Not the gentlest breath of transcendental 
freedom! must be allowed to blow through ever so small a 
chink into the teacher’s domain. If so, how is he to begin to 
deal with the lawless marvels of a being superior to natural 
laws, on whose assistance he cannot reckon, whose interruptions 
  1 Kant calls freedom transcendental, because its bearer, the intelligible 
character of the human being, is transcendental, that is to say, lies beyond 
every possible experience. An intelligible character, however, belongs to the 
active subject, in so far as it is thing in itself. Opposed to this stands the 
empirical, which belongs to the active subject, in so far as it is phenomenal, 
an object of the sensuous world. The empirical character is conditioned by 
temperament, life, intercourse, ete. The intelligible (the absolute capacity) 
is not determinable, only determining, independent of time andits causality.

  he can neither foresee nor prevent ? Perhaps to provide oppor- 
tunities—to remove hindrances? Was the absolute capacity then 
hindered after all? Are there then opportunities for it ex- 
ternal to its own pure original beginning? Is then the intel- 
ligible again imprisoned within the mechanism of natural 
things? The philosophers, it is to be hoped, will remember 
their own concept better. Transcendental freedom neither can 
nor ought to allow itself to be met with in consciousness as an 
inner phenomenon. On the contrary, that freedom of choice 
which we all find in ourselves, which we honour as the most 
beautiful phenomenon in ourselves, and would fain exalt among 
the other phenomena of ourselves—this it is which the tutor 
strives to influence and firmly grasp. 
“A making” which the pupil himself discovers when choosing 
the good and rejecting the bad—this or nothing is formation of 
character! This rise to self-conscious personality ought with- 
out doubt to take place in the mind of the pupil himself, and 
be completed through his own activity ; it would be nonsense if 
the teacher desired to create the real essence of the power to do 
it, and to pour it intothe soul of his pupil. But to place the 
power already existent and in its nature trustworthy under such 
conditions that it must infallibly and surely accomplish this 
rise—this it is which the teacher must look upon as possible, 
which to attain, to affect, to investigate, to forward, and to 
guide, he must regard as the great object of all his efforts. 
It will now be necessary to submit the concept morality, 
which we must here assume to be known and granted, to a 
critical philosophical examination, the commencement of which 
is mere analysis, while the continuation necessarily becomes 
synthetical as it establishes the preswmptions to which the con- 
cept mainly relates, without our being able to reckon them in 
its contents. The form of this examination is very generally 
used, but cannot here exhibit its full strength and accuracy.! 
Obedience is the primary predicate of the good will. Con- 
fronting it must stand a command, or at least something which 
1 The method of seeking out necessary supplementary concepts when 
they are hidden, Herbart calls the method of relationships (Beziehungen). 
 
-P-A-G-E-82
  62 Science of Education. 
can appear as command. The command has something com- 
manded as object. But not every obedience to the first chance 
command is moral. The individual obeying must have ex- 
amined, chosen, valued the command; that is, he himself must 
have raised it for himself to the level of acommand. The 
moral man commands himself. What does he command him- 
self? Here there is universal confusion. Kant, who felt this 
confusion most of all, finally, after much temporizing, hastily 
substituted the form of the command, the universality (where- 
by he distinguished it from momentary caprice) in the place 
of the contents. Others substitute their theoretical concepts— 
approach to the Divinity, to the pure Ego, to the Absolate— 
nay more, some even put the customs and laws of the 
country, or even the utilitarian, the agreeable, into the vacant 
place. The impartial thinker recognizes the empty place to be 
empty. He argues,—we all know the concept of morality ; if it 
contained but one definite object of command, we should know 
this together with the concept. Therefore it does not contain 
one definite object. But the concept (of morality) refers never- 
theless to a command presupposed, 7.e. to a presupposed act 
of willing, for command is itself will, This willing! must be. 
primary and original; obedience follows after. If then this 
original willing is not conditioned, but yet real, then it is 
obviously an unconditioned manifold. Herein lies the reason 
why we are not led to it (the original willing) from the starting 
point of obedience, for opposite to this (obedience) stands as 
command only the general concept, viz. that there exists in 
general such a willing which comes forth as command, in 
opposition to all inclinations and individual chance desires. 
Before we now seek out that which is characteristic of those 
acts of the mind which here, in contrast to the obeying will, 
appear as commanding will, two remarks are necessary. First, 
these acts cannot in themselves be moral, properly speaking, 
since they exist antecedently, are there independently before 
they enter into the relationship of command which they hold 
1 We use “ willing” as a rendering of Wollen, rather than “ volition,” 
because Herbart refers here rather to individual acts of willing than to their 
sum, volition. 
 
-P-A-G-E-83
Ai sthetic Revelation of the World. 63 
  to the inclinations; only in so far as they become a link in this 
relationship, do they belong to morality. The primordial 
element of the commanding will is to be sought for in an 
entirely different sphere. Secondly, so far as these undeter- 
mined manifold acts are motives to obedience, they must be of 
such a nature, that they can be comprehended within the 
general concept to which the universal and single vow of faith- 
fulness is due, together with the single and constant watchful- 
ness, self-criticism and humility, which constitute the crown of 
morality. 
The composition of these acts must be so conditioned that 
thereby everything foreign shall be rejected ; it must show the 
rigour of the contrast between the worthy and good on the 
one side, the common and bad on the other; through it the 
clear penetrating and commanding voice of the moral impera- 
tive must arise. For antecedently to the relation of reason to 
inclination all this is inconceivable. Such a composition can- 
not be merely logical. It cannot be learned from a well- 
classified doctrine of morality ; such a doctrine cools the will, 
and does not impel it. It requires much rather a partly 
poetical, partly pragmatic composition. But it is now time to 
seek for the elements which are to enter into the composition 
of these acts. 
In vain should we impose obedience on the desires, if we 
would subsequently transform reason again into desire. Kant’s 
axiom remains eternally true—no practical (moral) principle 
must require the actuality of any object whatever. But what 
follows from this? Nothing else than that originally reason is 
not everywhere will, for will which wills nothing is a contra- 
diction. Reason hears, and it forms a judgment after it has 
heard perfectly. It looks, and passes sentence, then turns its 
gaze and looks further. This will be confirmed if we again 
take up the former threads. The obeying subject respects the 
command, that is, he creates it, at least as command. How 
must he in so doing appear to himself? As giving the decisive 
sentence P Or as finding an existent necessity ? Must he desire 
to make himself felt as lord and master, as owner as it were of 
his inner store of feeling and life? Or would it perhaps, even 
 
-P-A-G-E-84
  64 Science of Education. 
if not truer, be at least safer for the correctness of his judg- 
ment, if he only tried to fathom the alien will of a perfected 
reason? He dare not appear to himself as giving the decisive 
sentence. for the first essential of morality-—obedience—is 
destroyed, and it is only one arbitrariness put in place of 
another, so soon as in any sense will becomes the ground of 
command. The moral man is intrinsically humble; this ac- 
quaintance with the concept of morality was assumed here! 
He appears then to himself as finding a necessity. Or perhaps 
he does not appear to himself at all, for he might discover the 
necessity without turning his glance on himself. A spon- 
taneous, more accurate answer to this question will be forth- 
coming a little later on. The first question is, what necessity 
is found? No theoretical necessity; we know the difference 
between ought and must, and to honour a command does not 
mean bowing to the inevitable. And again, no logical necessity ; 
for this is in itself nothing but a “must”; it points beyond 
to a higher principle, and thus only staves off the question how 
and why it is necessary. Thus it is nothing inferred, nothing 
learned, nothing given in experience or discovered in the 
teachings of nature. To this extent Kant, who makes the 
empirical strictly opposed to pure reason, was right. We must 
hope no one will answer at this point—it is a moral necessity 
(which is discovered). For we have but just proved that 
we are here entirely outside the realm of the moral. We are 
speaking of the originally necessary, which then first becomes 
the morally necessary when it rules obedience in opposition to 
the inclinations. 
Amongst known necessities the only one remaining is the 
esthetic. 
The characteristic of this necessity is, that it speaks in 
purely absolute judgments entirely without proof, without, in a 
word, enforcing its claims. It takes absolutely no consideration 
of the inclinations, neither favouring nor opposing them. It 
arises on the clear presentation of its object. There are pre- 
cisely as many primary judgments as there are varied objects, 
which judgments are not related to each other in any way so 
as to be logically deducible from one another. At the most it is 
 
-P-A-G-E-85
    At sthetic Revelation of the World. 65 
  found that after rejecting everything accidental, similar re- 
lationships are found among various objects, and that these 
naturally create similar judgments. As far as we know the 
simple esthetic relations, we have simple judgments about 
them. These stand at the head of the arts with quite inde- 
pendent authority. Amongst the arts, music in this respect 
affords a striking example. It can definitely and collectively 
enumerate its relations of harmony, and just as definitely show 
their correct use. If however the teacher of thorough bass 
were asked for proofs, he would only laugh, or pity the deaf 
ear which had not already percewed them.’ It is specially 
important that wsthetic judgments never require the actuality 
of their objects.?, Only when that object does exist, and when it 
is permanent, does the judgment, which declares what it ought 
to be, also stand. And through this persistency, it becomes in 
the end to the human being who cannot escape it, the sternest 
necessity. Want of taste is a crime in the artist, of course 
only in so far as he sets up to be an artist. There is nothing 
to debar him from destroying his picture which is a failure, 
or closing the instrument of which he is not master, and finally 
from giving up art entirely. 
But from himself aman cannot separate himself. Were he 
himself at any time the object of such judgments, these latter 
would, through their gentle but always audible voice, exercise 
in time a compulsion over him, exactly as they do over the 
votary who has once set his mind on being an artist. We must 
add here that when a judgment of taste breaks forth from the 
depth of the mind, it will, thanks to the nature of its origin, 
be often felt as a power which does not properly lie in what it 
utters. Happy is it, when such an uprushing is victorious at 
1 Note by Herbart.—May we say that the musical doctrines which bear 
the strange names of thorough bass are the only correct model of a genuine 
ssthetic which has yet existed? (We must here emphasize that thorough 
bass only forms a very small part of a complete theory of music.) This 
thorough bass asks and wins for its simple intervals, harmonies, and pro- 
gressions, absolute judgments, without explaining or proving anything. In 
the same way we can transfer to the relationships of will an approval or 
disapproval like those existing for the relationships of notes.

  66 Science of Education, 
the very beginning, for it disappears with time; but the judg- 
ment remains, and itis its slow pressure which men call con- 
scrence. 
Finding then original practical, that is sesthetic necessity, 
the moral individual controls his desire in order to obey this 
necessity. The desire then was a link in an esthetic relation- 
ship. And as far as the same desire is in him, which exists in 
the relationships judged, so far does the individual in his con- 
templation turn his glance inwards upon himself. For the 
rest, the esthetic demand would doubtless remain precisely the 
same, if another, standing in just the same relationship, were 
the one possessed by the desire. Thus we judge of others, only 
more easily than of ourselves, and the demand is authoritative, 
at least ought to be so for another, and we expect him to find 
it so himself. 
If we would learn the esthetic judgments which depend on 
volition, that is, if we would construct a practical (moral) 
philosophy, we must entirely give up once and for all the idea 
of one supreme moral law, as the sole voice of pure reason, of 
which all other moral laws would be only developments. On 
the contrary, in considering the will by degrees in the simplest 
conceivable relationships ' which follow from its direction upon 
itself, upon other wills and upon. objects, there springs up 
as a result for each of these relationships also, an original, 
absolutely independent ssthetic judgment, self-evident, and of 
peculiar nature. We should subsequently have to arrange the 
judgments so obtained to form therefrom a plan of life. This 
could easily be done, if we had acquired those judgments at 
the very beginning in their peculiar clearness, in their simplest 
and most exact expressions, and undisfigured by the attempts of 
false philosophy to reduce one to the other. The contrary 
explains without trouble why it is so difficult to build up from 
these judgments, of which daily life is the fortuitous and vary- 
ing cause, a trustworthy system of practical (moral) opinions, 
through which the character can receive solidarity and unity. 
If, however, science has provided in this construction for a

correct outline, then the fulness of life, partly transfigured by 
poetry, partly penetrating as the truth of history, will help to 
reveal that sketch, at one time as a whole, at another partly 
painted in with varying colours, lighted up by this or that 
contrast. 
But this pedagogic thought comes prematurely, though only 
by a very little. For the application of our general considera- 
tions is at hand; only one retrospective glance at moral obedi- 
ence is necessary. In what relation does obedience stand to 
this system of practical (moral) reason? The obeying element 
should be and remain will, but its direction it ought in part to 
alter. Now originally all willing, desiring, longing, are directed 
towards objects. 
And it must not be thought that these objects permit of 
being moved about as it were in their places under the will at 
pleasure. To him who wills little, everything is spoiled as 
soon as this little is denied him. Therefore only in the ab- 
stract can we separate the will from its direction. 
But he who knows and thinks much, requires much, and in 
him whose presentations are well associated, the desires are 
also associated. To alter the direction of the desires means 
really restraining one desire, but in such a way that near it 
another immediately lies ready to spring up. This is possible 
only to a very mobile and active mind. Just for this reason it 
is easier tomen than children. But to well-brought-up children 
there is gwen and won, by means of disicipline, freedom to restrain 
each desire for the moment without much trouble, a freedom it 
must be added which in itself alone has absolutely nothing in 
common with morality. Still we see immediately, that all 
depends whether egoism or practical (moral) reason becomes 
master of this freedom; if the former, it becomes worldly 
wisdom, if the latter, morality. 
Here then there lies immediately before us the first work of 
discipline. We ought to arouse many desires, but in no wise 
permit any one of them to rush unrestrained on its object. It 
ought to seem as if an immeasurable store of will power lay . 
locked in a mental reservoir, which can be opened by reason 
only, when, where, and how it wills. And it will seem so, if from 
 
-P-A-G-E-88
    68 Science of Education, 
the beginning the contact with objects is as varied as possible, 
and if, moreover, the always perceptible restraint is effectual 
enough, under the circumstances, to stamp indelibly on the 
mind the conviction, that the attainment of no object is to be 
reckoned upon unconditionally. For the rest, it is acknow- 
ledged that discipline acts best as an impersonal necessity, and 
that it must be tempered by much love and much spontaneous 
kindness; we assume further, above all, the suppression of 
everything capricious in children without lessening their 
joyousness. 
As crude desire, however, should be curbed that it may 
not prove its power in action and thereby become decided will, 
we must on the other hand, when right ideas reveal themselves, 
place them in action, and support them till they reach their end. 
Thus reason learns its power and takes courage to rule. 
When we see a boy, it matters not whether he has to thank 
art, or nature and fortune for it, who essays much, but easily 
rejects what he finds to be foolish, and carries out firmly and 
persistently what he has matured, a boy who can be easily 
roused in all manner of ways, easily excited by unsuitable 
treatment, easily taught, turned, put to shame by the right 
word ; then we rejoice at the sight and prophesy good things 
of him. We call him free because we presume he will with his 
open eye discover and hear what is reasonable, and we know 
there lies no rebelliousness in him which can silence and over- 
power his judgments. 
But we must not forget that something still depends on what — 
sort of a world the boy finds before him in which he will 
exercise his judgments and his actions. 
This world being a rich open circle filled with manifold life, 
he will examine it in all its parts. What he can reach, he will 
touch and move to investigate its whole power of motion, the 
rest he will look at and transfer to his mind. He will take the 
measure of individuals, and their conduct, compare modes of 
living and classes of society according to their splendour, 
advantages and freedom. He will, at least in thought, imitate, 
taste, choose. If any material charm seizes him strongly, he 
will calculate, and then he is lost to pure morality.
-P-A-G-E-89

Or perhaps nothing chains him. The years of boyhood pass 
with him amidst the continual pursuit of pleasures of the 
moment. If only he is sure of his bodily power, his health, his 
freedom from need, and of his inner control, and has collected by 
observation, as opportunity offered, a store of keenly observed 
phenomena, that he may not feel strange among the things of 
the world, he will then perceive the kind of behaviour which is 
demanded from youths on their first entrance into society. 
With the fear of being found wanting, with the wish to learn, 
but otherwise composed and without anything to seek or to fear, 
he steps in and looks around. Then his concentrated reflection 
will grasp all relations ; the contrast of the ridiculous and the 
seemly will determine his judgment as easily as his behaviour. 
And in contact with the seemly, he will find the honourable 
and the shameful, honesty and truth, falsity and treachery. And 
if only he has a truly imitative disposition he will at first be 
full of sympathy, of feeling, and enter into the sufferings and 
hopes of others. He will be disposed accordingly to that 
reflection which recognises and values beauty of soul-goodness. 
Out of these perceptions he will prepare for himself a law, and 
an obligation to follow the law, for he cannot do otherwise ; he 
would despise himself did he not follow it. Therefore he will 
obey it, and he can do so; we call him once again free with 
increased emphasis, and rightly so in the noblest sense of the 
word, even if you know ever so exactly how he would and 
must become so. 
Whether he becomes free or not, and to what extent, depends 
on the psychological accident whether he is absorbed first in 
the calculations of egoism, or in the wsthetic comprehension of 
the world surrounding him. This accident ought not to remain 
one. The teacher ought to have the courage to assume, that he 
can, if he begins rightly, determine that comprehension so 
easily and strongly through the esthetic revelation of the world, 
that the free attitude of the mind will receive its law, not from 
worldly wisdom, but from pure practical (moral) consideration. 
Such a revelation of the world—the whole known world, and 
every known age—obliterating if necessary the bad impressions 
of undesirable environment, may with justice be called the 
 
-P-A-G-E-90
  70 Science of Education. 
chief work of education, for which that discipline, which 
awakens and controls desire, is nothing but the necessary pre- 
paration. 
The concept of an esthetic comprehension of the world is 
wider than that of the analogous comprehension of human 
desire, consequently wider than that which morality imme- 
diately requires. And it ought to be so. For although external 
objects are adventitious to us, and although it is very impor- 
tant to reckon as adventitious as much as possible, it is never- 
theless impossible to us altogether to go out of the sphere of 
the external. And at this point, so many demands of taste 
arise whose mode of demand is at the bottom none other than 
that of the wsthetic judgment of the will. Their necessity 
will also be more strongly felt in proportion as the external is 
more closely attached to us, Hence the power with which 
external honour, respectability, the social tone, in short, every- 
thing that tends to suppress barbarism, makes its claim authori- 
tative on men whose culture hasbegun. It has been said there 
is but one virtue. Almost as accurately could we say, there 
is but one taste. Whoever at any time injures it in cold reflec- 
tion is on the road, if not to forsake the moral, at least to base 
it more on extraneous principles springing from efforts after 
personal greatness and well-being, or from civic, priestly, or 
worldly wisdom. 
Regarding the question, how a general esthetic revelation of 
the world must be planned, we have here but one remark to 
add, and that truly is but a repetition of what has gone before,— 
we must be on our guard against reducing the judgments of 
taste to one another. And again it follows therefrom—we 
must also be on our guard against denying the possibility 
of collisions amongst those judgments. If, however, early and 
wide reading of chosen classical poets be required of the pupils, 
and with this the exercise of their perceptive power in the 
comprehension of works of art of all kinds, then the inter- 
connection even of the most abstruse causes will be easily 
divined. But more on this subject afterwards. 
It only remains to mention some chief characteristics of the 
revelation of the world, as far as it immediately touches 
morality.

It may be taken for granted that, on account of their 
simplicity and absolute priority, the child cannot help forming 
the simple fundamental judgments of the will ‘—certainly not 
as formule, but as judgments in individual cases—provided 
opportunity is offered to him by his environment. It is often 
said, and it is hoped generally recognized, that the mother’s 
tender care, the father’s kind seriousness, the relationship of 
the family, the order of the house, must exist in all purity and 
worthiness before the child’s ingenuous eyes, because he judges 
only what he observes, because what he sees is to him the only 
thing possible, aud the pattern for his imitation. 
Assuming these first conditions to be fulfilled (or tolerably 
compensated for later, by the beneficent humanity of a good 
teacher), what further steps does education take at this point P 
It must leave the narrow circle, it would be guilty of the most 
blameable weakness, were it from fear of what is beyond, to try 
and limit the child yet longer to what is near him, when he 
has finished learning therein, and looks and strives onwards. 
Upwards and outwards that education must take its way. 
Upwards there is but one step, only one, and nothing higher 
beyond; outwards there is illimitable breadth and depth. On 
the upward step, the supersensuous kingdom must open itself, 
for, in the whole visible world, the family circle is the most 
beautiful and most worthy. But opposite to this supersensuous 
kingdom lies the actwal, and on the one hand shows with im- 
portunate clearness its own deficiencies and its needs, while on 
the other it is the duty of education to disclose completely what 
the pupil does not, and yet must see, that he may be able to 
live as a human being. 
But as these contrasts respectively balance each other, and 
the more so the further distant they are from the mean, we 
should easily arrive at the rule to move simultaneously and 
regularly on both lines, in order that by the side of ever- 
1 Note by Herbart.—One has good reason at the present time to protect 
oneself from the suspicion of wishing to invent a new morality, and thereby 
scoffing at the strict requirements of the old and true morality. For this 
reason the known names Rectitude, Goodness, Self-control, may stand here. 
Their more precise definition is reserved, and will seek to be of service, not 
in saying anything new, but in making the old plainer.

deepening shadows (of the actual) we might cause an ever 
stronger light (of the supersensuous) to shine out all the more 
brilliantly, if only the way were equally open on both sides and 
continued so. 
God, the true centre of all practical (moral) ideas and of 
their illimitable workings, the Father of men and Lord of the 
world—He must fill the background of memory as the oldest 
and the first to whom all reflections of the mind, turning from 
the confused tangle of life, must always revert, that it may re- 
pose as in its true self in the rest of belief. But just because this 
highest Being ought to occupy an immovable place amongst the 
earliest thoughts on which the personality of the growing man 
fastens, and because He as the Highest, can never be yet further 
exalted, there is danger that a human being, by continually 
fixing his mind on the single simple point, would only deform 
it, and it would be degraded to the commonplace, yes, even to 
the wearisome. And wearisome, the thought that ceaselessly 
shames and reproves human weakness certainly ought not to 
become, or it succumbs to the first daring attempt of speculation 
to make its own world. Rather should we keep the idea less 
active, that when the man needs it for his safety in the storms 
of life, it is then unspoiled. But there is a means of nourish- 
ing, strengthening, cultivating this idea slowly, and insuring to 
it an ever-increasing veneration, a means which to him who 
knows it theoretically is at the same time valid as the only one, 
namely, that of establishing the idea continuously by means of 
contrast. 
And it is indeed just this to which that other direction—the 
outward—the progressive revelation of the world leads, entirely 
of itself. 
For reasons, the proof of which would be too detailed here, 
it is clear that instruction has to guide two separated, but 
always simultaneously advancing courses from below upwards 
to that highest immovable point, that it may unite both at last 
in it. We may distinguish these courses by the names Know- 
ledge and Sympathy. Training in acuteness and the first 
preparation for contemplative observation (Anschauung) and 
the work immediately following it, in short, the A BC of the

  senses, are the beginnings of the course of knowledge. It would 
be somewhat more difficult to state the starting-point of pro- 
gressive sympathy and to justify the statement. Closer con- 
sideration soon shows that this point cannot lie in the actual 
present. The child’s sphere is too narrow, and traversed too 
soon, the adult’s sphere is among cultivated people too high and 
too much determined by relationships, which we would not 
willingly explain to the little boy if we could. But the time- 
successions of history end in the present, and in the beginnings 
of our culture amongst the Greeks, an illuminated spot for the 
whole of posterity is formed by the classical representations of 
an ideal boyhood in the Homeric poems. If we are not afraid 
to allow the noblest among languages to take precedence, in 
our instruction, of the accepted learned language, we shall, on 
the ‘one hand, escape numberless perversions and distortions 
in everything touching the right understanding of the literature 
and history of mankind, of opinions, and of arts; 1 and we shall, 
on the other, be more sure of presenting to the child’s interest, 
events and characters which he can perfectly grasp, and from 
which he can go on to endlessly varied self-reflections on human 
beings and society, and the dependence of both on a higher 
power. 
The earliest cultivation of the child’s feelings will have been 
a failure, if, after taking his fill of pleasure in the characters, 
the moral impression left from those old stories is at all doubt- 
ful. The relation of fable to truth, and of barbarism to culture, 
must be apparent to the boy, when he compares that picture 
with the circle in which he lives. And the double contrast, 
partly between the poet’s people and those of his own world 
whom he loves and honours, partly between those gods and the 
Providence whom he pictures after the image of his parents, 
and whom he worships after their example—the contrast, I say 
produces on a pure and youthful mind an influence contrary to 
1 Note by Herbart.—This subject is so important and full of matter, that 
it would require a book to itself. The author does not write without con- 
vincing experience that it can be carried out. For many reasons the 
Odyssey should have preference over the Iliad. But after completion of 
the tenth year, this commencement would come too late.
-P-A-G-E-94
  74 Science of Education. 
  that which it does on those who seek refuge from the tedium of 
lengthy sermons in their imagination, with which they daringly 
play, and find compensation in imaginative feats in which they 
wonder at their own dexterity. The boy plays in real life, and 
it is by play that he realises for himself his imaginings. If 
any boy were so unhappy as to grudge the Deity His super- 
sensuous kingdom, and wanted empty space therein for his 
fictions, he evidently has but little external life; we must 
improve his diet and increase his gymnastic exercises. 
But the world, as he looks at it in hours of seriousness, widens 
more and more ; always lying between the two like extremes, 
it extends outwards as it were into far distances, making room 
for the crowd of characters which come forth on the thread of 
history, each one illumined if possible by its best classical 
delineator, or at least by the glow which spreads itself from 
the purest sources of historic light over the more obscure parts. 
Periods which no master has described, whose spirit no poet 
breathes, are of little value to education. But if the languages 
are taught for the sake of the literature, it is strange that 
teachers should destroy the pupil’s interest in the writings by 
giving him preliminary stories made up of insipid extracts, 
and written moreover in an absurd tone which children might 
imitate. The continuous study of modern times belongs to 
mature youth; the boy would wander at leisure in an earlier 
world, especially in the old, if he, only just grown out of the 
needs of childhood, began his Homer as he ought at that 
time. 
“To every man his due.” This proverb will be justified in 
every exhibition, observation, and illustration of the various 
characters. The pure, the stainless, which every true poetry 
shows when it exhibits and groups individualities—this, if not 
to imitate, at least to receive thankfully from that poetry, and 
use it thoughtfully, is the teacher’s first duty. But the picture 
he ought to show has no frame; it is open and wide as the 
world. In it, therefore, all the characteristics whereby the 
various kinds of poetry differentiate themselves, fall away, and 
naked and bare stand all the faults and weaknesses, which are 
otherwise excused under the design of the work of art. Con- 
 
-P-A-G-E-95

  science accompanies us to the play, however much the poet 
may protest. The teacher, supported by Plato’s authority, 
banishes the poet from his sphere, unless the truth and the 
distinctness of the bad, will and can serve for purification of 
the better, and for elevation of the good. 
While then through the reading of poets and historians, 
through growing knowledge of men, through moral and religious 
discourses which help to digest the previously collected material, 
the moral distinctions become sharper, observation of shades 
of character and the estimation of their distances by a moral 
measurement become rectified, and the elements of the prac- 
tical (moral) idea of God gain increasingly in clearness and 
dignity thereby ;—during all this there develops on the side 
of knowledge the concept of nature in increasing sharpness of 
. outline, as the system of forces and motions, which, rigorously 
persistent in a course ence begun, forms for us a type of law, 
and order, and sharply defined proportion. How defective 
would be the revelation of the world, how little would the 
actual and the given find a place therein, how shadowy would 
they float in the airy realms of thought if we shut out nature ! 
And how badly would that revelation harmonize with the spirit 
of a life formed on reason! Do you think you can teach how 
to act solely through the moral ideas? Man stands in the 
midst of nature; himself a part of her, her power streaming 
through his innermost self, he answering external force with 
his own according to his method, his nature, first thinking, then 
willing, then working. Through his will goes the chain of na- 
ture. But there is one definite place for each definite will. This 
destiny, sprung solely out of the individuality of environment, 
which inevitably becomes special for each separate example 
of the race, in contradistinction to his (7.e. the separate 
examples) origin from the supreme plan of nature which was 
designed in the first instance for the race by an all-ordering 
Providence—this destiny is the necessity which impels men ; 
it is this necessity which a man must needs see and consider 
in order rightly to determine his steps and their measure at each 
moment. For the moral idea doubtless appeals to the race, 
but it is dumb to the individual so far as he is individual; it

  76 Science of Education. 
  knows nothing of his immediate limits ; it condemns and puts 
him to shame, but it cannot aid. It wishes that he should 
reach the goal; he is on the road, but it knows nothing of that 
road, much less can it guide him. Himself and his powers and 
the powers around which can aid him, the man must know, 
and acknowledge their limitations, if their power is to be 
serviceable to him according to their measure. 
This destiny, however, is not the ancient potpa, that destroyer 
of life, that pure contradiction of mind. 
This destiny cannot possibly distress the moral man. For 
he does not expect that humanity and reason should reach per- 
fection in hisindividuality. He goes forth to meet Providence, 
he seeks himself to join in her care for the race, he hears the 
summons to continue that which is begun, he realizes that 
theodicy ' is left to the actions of men. 
But where does education stop? How does the pupil attain 
insight into these results of his individuality ? These questions 
are a sign that the end is approaching. For the man soon 
comes to look on himself as nature, when he once knows nature 
in general. But no one can be expected to think himself into 
the strict uniformity of nature, who has had no training in the 
rigorous discipline of mathematics and its deductions. 
And further, previous to investigation of laws, a keen com- 
prehension of data is necessary. It needs in general, attention, 
a giving up of the individual to what lies before him, an early ~ 
discipline of the roving thoughts, an early habit of perseverance 
in, and completion of, work begun. These thoughts have already 
found their place in the introduction ? to this essay. 
It still remains for the favourably disposed and thoughtful 
reader to connect and fill in these outlines. What is offered 
here is not intended to appear as a whole. But it ought to be 
clear that we have the courage to ignore, at least when speak- 
ing of education, certain systems by which it can never profit. 
W hat is here said may be left open for the present to the objec-

tions raised by those systems. It is, I hope, neither old nor new 
enough to afford any one the pleasure of making it square with 
alien theories, and of thinking he understands it better than 
the author himself. Otherwise the latter would be compelled 
to say, he considers it a bad example, not of acuteness, but of 
weak-mindedness, should any one show an inclination to amalga- 
mate the distinctive statements of different thinkers. Above 
all, the author believes he will never be understood by those to 
whom the coexistence of determinism and morality is still a 
riddle. 
Some there may be who perhaps do not willingly find such 
abstract investigations in the vicinity of an A B O of An- 
schauung. I implore such to consider, that for once it may be 
useful if an educational essay affordsanopportunity for estimating 
the breadth and the sphere of education, and the vastness of the 
problems lying before it, by the distance which must be traversed. 
in order to mount from the lowest to the highest—a distance 
into which we must look, because the highest must be prepared 
for by the lowest.

  GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF THE SCIENCE OF EDU- 
CATION PSYCHOLOGICALLY DEDUCED FROM 
ITS AIM. 
By Jowann Frieprico Herpart. 
Introduction, 
THE aim of all those who educate and demand education is 
determined by the range of thought they bring to the subject. 
The majority of those who teach have entirely neglected in the 
first instance to construct for themselves their own range of 
thought in view of this work; it opens out gradually as the 
work progresses, and is formed partly by their own character- 
istics, partly by the individuality and environment of the 
pupil. If the teachers possess originality, they will utilize all 
that comes to hand to provide stimulus and occupation for the 
objects of their care; if they have foresight, they exclude all 
which may be harmful to health, disposition, or manners. Thus 
a boy grows to manhood, who is tested in everything that is not 
dangerous, practised in the consideration and treatment of the 
common things of daily life, and with all the sensibilities which 
the narrow circle wherein he lives can arouse in him. If he 
has really grown up thus, he may be congratulated on the 
result. But educators complain unceasingly of the harmful 
influence of surrounding circumstances—of servants, relatives, 
playmates, the natural instincts and the university. And it is 
no wonder, when the mental diet is determined more by chance 
than by human skill, that a robust health, which can bid defi- 
ance to unfavourable influences, cannot always flourish on fare 
that is often so meagre. 
Rousseau desired at any rate to harden his pupil. He defined 
for himself his own view of the subject, and remained true 
to it. He follows nature. All the processes of animal develop- 
ment in man are, by means of education, to be assured of a free

happy growth from the mother’s arms to the marriage bed. 
To live is the réle which he teaches. Yet he evidently sympa- 
thizes with our poet’s dictum, “ Life is not the highest good,” 
for he sacrifices in theory the whole individual life of the 
teacher, whom he gives up to be the boy’s constant companion. 
This education costs too dear. The companion’s life is in any 
case worth more than the boy’s, even if we go no further than 
mortality tables; for the probability of being able to live is 
greater for the man than the boy. But is mere existence then, 
so difficult to man? We thought human plants were like the 
rose ; that just as the queen of flowers gives the gardener least 
trouble of all, so human beings thrive in every climate, are 
nourished by every species of food, learn most easily to accom- 
modate themselves to all circumstances, and to turn everything 
to advantage. Still itis true that to educate a “nature man” 
among cultivated men must entail as much trouble on the 
educator, as it afterwards will on the pupil to live in the middle 
of so heterogeneous a society. 
How to behave in society, is what Locke’s pupil will know 
best. The principal thing for him is conventionality. For 
fathers who destine their sons for the world, no book of educa- 
tion according to Locke need be written ; anything superadded 
would degenerate into artificiality. Buy at any price a trust- 
worthy man of refined habits, who “ himself knows the rules of 
courtesy and good society with all the varieties arising from 
difference of persons, times, and places, and who will then 
assiduously direct his pupil as suits his age to the observation 
of these things.”+ One can say nothing to this. It would be 
vain to wish to dissuade real men of the world from making their 
sons men of the world too. The desire that they should be so 
is formed by the whole force of all the impressions of actual 
life, and is confirmed and increased by the new impressions of 
every moment. Preachers, poets, philosophers, may be all 
' Locke, Some Thoughts concerning Education, par. 93. ‘To forma 
young gentleman as he should be,’tis fit his governor should himself be well- 
bred, understand the ways of carriage, and measures of civility in all the 
variety of persons, times, and places, and help his pupil, as much as his age 
requires, constantly to the observation of them.”

  unction, all gaiety, all gravity in prose or verse, but one glance 
at the world around destroys all the effect, and they seem mere 
actors or visionaries. For the rest, a worldly education may 
succeed, for the world is in league with the worldly. 
But I could tell of men who know the world without loving 
it; who while they will not withdraw their sons from the world, 
will allow them still less to be lost therein, and who assume 
that a clear head will find in its own self-consciousness, its own 
sympathy, and its own tastes, the best teachers, to guide it at 
the right time so far into the conventionalities of society as it 
is willing to go. Such men allow their sons to gain a know- 
ledge of mankind among such comrades as may happen to be 
their playmates or rivals. They know that Nature is best 
learned from Nature, if only the power of observation has been 
sharpened, exercised, and trained at home, and they desire that 
their children shall grow up in the midst of the generation with 
whom in the future they will live. Is this compatible with 
good education? Perfectly, so long as during the hours of 
instruction (these are to me once for all the hours, since in them 
the teacher is occupied seriously and systematically with the 
pupil) such mental activity is pursued as will arouse all his 
interest ; compared with this all boys’ play will become trifling, 
and of little account even to the boy himself. 
Such mental activity will never be met with, however much 
men may oscillate between the sensuous facts of their immediate 
environment and between books. On the other hand, it will be 
found in the union of both. A young man who is susceptible 
to the charm of ideas, who has the conception of education in all 
its beauty and all its greatness before his eyes, and who is not 
afraid to resign himself for a time to numberless alternations of 
hope and doubt, despair and joy—such aman can undertake the 
task of training up a boy in the environment of actuality to a 
nobler life, provided always that he possesses mental force and 
science to apprehend and represent this actuality as, from the 
point of view of humanity, only a fragment of the great whole.!   
  1 Herbart perceived that the teacher’s happiness consists in the pursuit of 
the Ideal, and in the revelation of ideas, and thus describes it in the Aphor- 
ismen zur Pidagogik. ‘‘The happiness of the teacher!’ He who seeks a 
 
-P-A-G-E-101

  He will then say of his own accord, that not he, but the whole 
power of what humanity has felt, experienced and thought, is 
the true and right educator, to which the boy is entitled, and 
that the teacher is:given to him merely that he may help him 
by intelligent interpretation and elevating companionship. 
Thus to present the whole treasure of accumulated research in 
a concentrated form to the youthful generation, is the highest 
service which mankind at any period of its existence can render 
to its successors, be it as teaching or as warning. 
Conventional education seeks to prolong existing evils; to 
form “ Nature-men ” (Naturmenschen bilden) means to repeat 
if possible from the beginning, the succession of evils already 
overcome. To narrow the sphere of teaching and warning to 
the immediate environment, is the natural result of a man’s 
own limitation, which neither knows what is beyond, nor 
understands its application. Children’s difficulties and the 
failures of pedants supply a convenient excuse for this, but the 
latter can be retrieved, and the former do not really exist. 
How far, however, this may, or may not be true, each man 
decides from his own experience—I from mine, others from 
theirs. Only let us all consider the proposition—each but ex- 
periences, what he attempts. A nonogenarian village school- 
master has the experience of his ninety years’ routine course ; 
he has the consciousness of his long toils, but has he also the 
criticism of his work and his methods? Much that is new has 
prospered with our modern educators; they have found their 
reward in the gratitude of men, and they can inwardly rejoice 
over it. But whether they can determine from their experi- 
ence all that can be attained by means of education, and all 
that can be done with children, is a question. 
It is much to be desired that those who wish to base education 
on experience alone, would for once attentively consider other 
happiness outside the inner sanctuary of the cultivation of his own ideas, 
which gives pure enjoyment of reason, and does not spring from chance, 
cau only gain it by working in some profession, whose object is the revela- 
tion of ideas within an existing Intelligence, which work more than any 
other in the world leaves room for order and inward contemplation. Doubt- 
less even here we are dependent on circumstances, but yet every happiness 
we seek outside ourselves, is given up for this work.

  experimental sciences ; that they would condescend to inquire, 
in the case of physics or chemistry, how much is really involved 
in the demonstration of one single proposition in the sphere 
of empiricism, with all the exactness that empiricism admits of. 
They would then eaperience, that nothing is learned from one 
experience, and just as little from scattered observations ; but 
that one must repeat the experiment twenty times with twenty 
variations before a result is obtained, which even then opposing 
theories can explain each in its own way. They would experi- 
ence then, that no one has a right to speak of experience until 
the experiment is completed, until, above all things, the resi- 
duum has been accurately weighed and tested. In the case of 
educational experiments, this residuum is represented by the 
faults of the pupil when he has attained to manhood. Thus 
the time required for one such experiment is at least half a 
human life. When then does any one become an experienced 
teacher P And of how many experiences, with how many 
variations is the experience of each to consist? How infinitely 
greater than this is the experience of the empirical doctor, 
and for how many centuries have the experiences of great 
men been recorded for him! Nevertheless the science of 
medicine is so weak, that it is just a swampy ground on 
which new sophistries so rankly grow.! 
Is this to be the fate of education also? Is it to become the 
shuttlecock of factions, which, themselves a sport of the time, 
have long ago carried everything of importance with them, and 
only left the apparently lowly realm of childhood untouched. 
It has already come to pass, that nothing is more natural to the 
younger and more philosophical teachers, who now see that 
thinking ought not to be divorced from education, than to 
test the perfect adaptability or pliancy of what is truly a very 
versatile wisdom in educating, in order to form, to synthetically 
improve, and mystically teach upon a priori principles, those 
intrusted to their care—and when patience fails, to reject them 
as incapable of preparation for initiation. The rejected ones

will pass no longer with the same fresh natures into other, and 
what other hands ? 
It would be better if the science of education remained as true 
as possible to its intrinsic conceptions, and cultivated more an 
independent mode of thought, by which it would become the 
centre of asphere of exploration, and be no longer exposed to the 
danger of government by a stranger as a remote tributary pro- 
vince. Only when each science seeks to teach in its own way, 
and also with the same force as its neighbours, can a beneficial 
intercourse take place between them. Surely philosophy must 
rejoice when other sciences approach her thoughtfully, and 
at any rate the philosophic public of the day, though not 
philosophy itself, sadly needs the chance of more numerous, 
more varied points of view, from which it can survey all sides. 
I have required science and mental force from the teacher. 
To others, science may be a pair of spectacles, to me itis an 
eye, and the best of eyes too, which human beings possess for 
the contemplation of their environment. It is true, that the 
teachings of all the sciences are not free from error, but this is 
the very reason why they disagree one with another ; the error 
betrays itself, or at least one learns to be careful about doubtful 
points. On the other hand, he who considers himself clever 
without scientific knowledge, fosters errors in his opinions, as 
great and even greater, without the consciousness, or perhaps 
even the possibility of consciousness of them, for his points of 
contact with the world are blunted. The errors of science are 
originally the errors of men, but only of the best minds. 
The first, though by no means the complete science of the 
educator, would be a psychology in which the total possibili- 
ties of human activity were sketched out a priort. I think I 
recognise the difficulty as well as the possibility of such a 
science. Long will it be before we have it, longer still before 
we can expect it from teachers. Never, however, can it be a 
substitute for observation of the pupil; the individual can only 
be discovered, not deduced. The construction of the pupil on 
a priori principles is therefore a misleading expression in itself, 
and is also at present an empty idea which the science of educa- 
tion cannot handle for a long time, 
 
-P-A-G-E-104
  84 Science of Education. 
  All the more necessary, therefore, is it to know that from 
which I started, namely the aim of those who begin to educate. 
One sees what one looks for; every clear head has psychological 
insight, in so far as it cares to look into the minds and hearts 
of men. What the educator should care for must lie open before 
him like a map, or if possible, like the plan of a well-built city, 
in which sets of lines having similar directions always intersect 
at exactly the same angle, and in which the eye finds itself at 
home without preparation. Such a map I offer here for the 
inexperienced, who wish to know what sort of experiences they 
must search for, and have ready for use. With what aim the 
teacher should grasp his work—this practical consideration, 
detailed at present down to the measures we have to choose 
according to our present views, is for me the first half of the 
science of education. Corresponding to this should stand a 
second half, in which the possibilities of education are theoretic- 
ally laid down, and portrayed as limited by changing circum- 
stances. Such a second half, however, is at present nothing 
more than a pious wish, as is also the psychology upon which it 
must rest. The first half is generally accepted for the whole, 
and I must be satisfied to fall in with this mode of speech.! 
Pedagogy is the science which the teacher needs for himself, 
but he must also be master of the science of imparting his 
knowledge. And I here at once confess, that I have no concep- 
tion of education without instruction, just as conversely, in this 
book at least, I do not acknowledge any instruction which does 
not educate. Whatever arts and acquirements a young 
man may learn from a teacher for the mere sake of profit, are 
as indifferent to the educator as the colour he chooses for his 
coat. But how his circle of thought is being formed is every- 
thing to the teacher, for out of thoughts come feelings, and from 
them principles and modes of action. ‘To think ont in relation 
to this chain of development eaeh and every thing that can be 
offered to the pupil and find a place in his mind, to enquire how 
each is connected with the whole, how one part must follow

another and again become a link to that which succeeds—this 
applied to the treatment of individual objects affords an infinite 
number of problems to the teacher, and also unlimited material, 
by the help of which, he can ceaselessly think over and criticise 
all the knowledge and works accessible, as well as all the prin- 
cipal occupations and exercises he must carry on. We need in 
this respect a number of educational monographs (introductions 
to the use of any of the individual means of culture) which must, 
however, be written strictly on one system. I tried to give an 
example of such a monograph in my A B OC of Observation 
(Anschauung), a book, which certainly has up to the present 
this fault, that it exists alone, and can neither rest on anything, 
nor support anything new. Of more important subjects for 
similar writings there is no lack; the study of botany, of 
Tacitus, of Shakespeare and many others could be treated as 
means of education. But I dare not invite any one to such a 
task, perhaps because I must presuppose a plan accepted and 
inwardly grasped, in which every subject finds its due place. 
In order, however, to bring out more clearly the idea of 
education through instruction, let us pause awhile at its oppo- 
site—education without instruction, examples of which are 
plentiful. Taken generally, teachers are not those who possess 
the most knowledge. But there are many (especially among 
governesses) who know nothing, or, if they have know- 
ledge, understand nothing of its scientific use, and who never- 
theless pursue their work with great zeal. How do they act? 
They dominate the feelings of the pupil, and holding him by 
this bond, unceasingly disturb the youthful character to such 
an extent, that it can never know itself... How then can cha- 
racter be formed? Character is inner stability, but how can 
a human being take root in himself, when he is not allowed to 
depend on anything, when you do not permit him to trust a 
single decision to his own will? In most cases it happens, that 
the youthful soul has in its depths a sacred corner, into which 
you never penetrate, and in which, notwithstanding your rough 
treatment, it lives for itself, dreams, hopes, and evolves plans

which will be tried at the first opportunity, and if successful 
will base a character, just on the very spot you did not know. 
This is the reason why the aim and the result of education are 
wont to have so little connection. Though certainly they often 
do agree in so far that the pupil in after life takes the seat of his 
teacher, and makes his subjects suffer as he bas suffered before 
them. The sphere of thought is here the same which daily 
experience gave in youth, only the uncomfortable place is 
changed for the comfortable. It is by obeying that one learns 
to rule, and even little children treat their dolls as they them- 
selves are treated. 
Education through instruction regards everything as instruc- 
tion which is given to the pupil as a subject of consideration. 
The discipline (Zucht)* itself under which he is placed, belongs 
to this, and it works far more through the example of an energy 
that maintains order, than it can through the direct checking of 
single naughty acts, which latter is usually described by the far 
teo pretentious title—correction of faults. The mere checking 
may leave the desire quite untouched, the imagination may 
even continue to embellish the object, and that is almost as bad 
as a continued committal of the fault, which assuredly will not 
be wanting in future years of freedom. But if the pupil reads 
in the mind of the teacher who punishes, moral disgust, the 
disapproval of his taste (Geschmack),? opposition to all dis- 
order, then he passes over to his point of view, he cannot help 
seeing things in the same way, and this thought becomes a 
strong inward power, controlling the desire, and only requires 
to be sufficiently strengthened to conquer. And it is easily seen 
that the same thought can be produced in many other ways— 
1 In bk. 3, ch. v. 2, Herbart remarked that what is here called Discipline 
Zucht) ought much rather to be termed Government (Regierung), but he 
id not wish to make use of his terminology in the introduction. 
2 Herbart uses this word here and afterwards with reference not only to 
matters of art, but also to questions of morality. Ruskin uses it thus 
also: ‘Taste is not only a part and an index of morality ; it is the only 
morality. The first and last and closest trial question to any living creature 
is, ‘What do youlike? Tell me what you like, and I will tell you what 
you are.’” 
 
-P-A-G-E-107
  Introduction. 87 
that a fault on the part of the pupil is not at all a necessary 
occasion for this instruction. 
I have demanded for education through instruction, science 
and mental force—such a science, such a mental force as can view 
and represent the near actuality as a fragment of the great 
whole. ‘Why of the whole, why of the remote?” it will be 
asked. ‘Is not the near sufficiently important and visible? 
Is it not full of relationships, which when not recognized and 
judged rightly in the small and the simplest cases, would be 
just as incorrectly comprehended, indeed much more so from 
the widest knowledge in the great? And we may prophesy, 
that this requirement will encumber education with a mass of 
learning and study of language, to the detriment of physical 
training, of dexterity in the fine arts, and of social happiness.’ 
Let us not be seduced by the just fear of these disadvantages 
to banish such studies. They only need other arrangement, so 
that without discursiveness and crowding out all other sub- 
jects, they shall yet never be simply means, shall never be dis- 
sociated from the main object, but bring from the beginning a 
constant and rich reward. Were such an arrangement impos- 
sible, were the heavy and destructive burden of customary Latin 
studies inevitable from the nature of the case, then we should 
be obliged to try constantly to banish school learning into odd 
corners, just as apothecaries bottle up poison that may on rare 
occasions have medicinal value. But supposing, that without 
requiring too extensive and involved preparation, a course of 
instruction can be really started which would cut straight and 
quickly through the fields of learning, without lingering in 
them too long—would the above-mentioned objection be then 
valid, i.e. that thereby children are uselessly removed from 
what is nearest to them, are uselessly and prematurely taken on 
journeys through strange lands? Is it possible, after deeper 
  1 These remarks refer to the opinions of the Philanthropinists, who in- 
sisted that the earliest instruction should make use of what is present and 
near as teaching material for children, and not estrange them by trans- 
porting them into the distant and the past. On this ground they opposed 
preliminary instruction in Latin, and the usual method of studying it, 
which they considered injurious to children’s health.
-P-A-G-E-108

and unbiassed thought, to maintain that the near is clear to 
children and full of relationships, judgment upon which can 
become the basis of further correct methods of thought? Let 
us leave corporeal things on one side. It is true that, notwith- 
standing sensuous proximity, these are not of themselves per- 
ceptible and intelligible to eye and understanding, but I avoid 
repeating what I said before about trigonometry and mathe- 
matics. The question now, however, is of men and human 
conditions. What does the near mean in their connection ? Is 
not the far that which we see in the interval between the child 
and the man? But this is as great as the space of time, whose 
long successions have carried us to our present point of culture 
and corruption. But this far distance is seen; we therefore 
write special books for children, in which everything incompre- 
hensible, every bad example is avoided, and to this end teachers 
are exhorted to come down even to the level of children, and, 
cost what it may, to enter their narrow sphere. And here the 
manifold new incongruities to which this gives rise are over- 
looked. It is overlooked that when the mature teacher is 
asked to come down from his own level to make a child-world 
for children, something is demanded, which ought not to be 
and which nature inevitably punishes. It is overlooked how 
warped in the end they who long pursue such a course are wont 
to be, and how unwillingly intellectual men enter upon it- 
Nor is this all. The undertaking is not successful, for it 
cannot be. Men cannot imitate the female style, how much 
less that of children. The intent to teach spoils children’s 
books at once; it is forgotten that every one, the child included, 
selects what suits him from what he reads, and judges the 
writing as well as the writer after his own fashion. Show the 
bad to children plainly, but not as an object of desire, and they 
will recognize that it 7s bad. Interrupt a narrative with moral 
precepts, and they will find you a wearisome narrator. Relate 
only what is good, and they will feel it monotonous, and the 
mere charm of variety will make the bad welcome. Remember 
your own feelings on seeing a purely moral play. But give to 
them an interesting story, rich in incidents, relationships, char- 
acters, strictly in accordance with psychological truth, and not

  Introduction. 89 
beyond the feelings and ideas of children; make no effort to 
depict the worst or the best, only let a faint half-unconscious 
moral tact secure that the interest of the action tends away 
from the bad towards the good, the just, the right; then you 
will see how the child’s attention is fixed upon it, how it seeks 
to discover the truth and think over all sides of the matter, 
how the many-sided material calls forth a many-sided judg- 
ment, how the charm of change ends in preference for the best, 
so that the boy who perhaps feels himself a step or two higher 
in moral judgment than the hero or the author, will cling to 
his view with inner self-approbation, and so guard himself 
from a coarseness he already feels beneath him. The story 
must have one more characteristic, if its effect is to be lasting 
‘and emphatic; it must carry on its face the strongest and 
clearest stamp of human greatness. For a boy distinguishes 
the common and ordinary from the praiseworthy as well as 
we ; he even has this distinction more at heart than we have, for 
he does not like to feel himself small, he wishes to bea man. The 
whole look of a well-trained boy is directed above himself, and 
when eight years old his entire line of vision extends beyond 
all histories of children. Present to the boy therefore such 
men as he himself would like to be. Such you will certainly 
not find near at hand, for the boy’s ideal of the man corresponds 
to nothing which has grown up under the influence of our 
present culture. Again you will certainly not find this ideal 
in your own imagination, for that is full of pedagogic ideas, 
full of your experiences, knowledge and personal affairs. Even 
were you a greater poet than ever was before (for every poet 
reflects his own age) you must still, if you wish to attain the 
reward of effort, increase that effort a hundredfold. For it 
follows from the preceding as a matter of course that the 
whole is trivial and unfruitful if it stands isolated ; it must be 
in the midst, or at the head of a long series of other means of 
education, so that through the general connection, the gains 
of each single process are seized and preserved. How then 
could that grow out of the entire literature of the future, 
which would be suitable fora boy who is not even on our level? 
I know of only one place where such a written story may be

  found—the classical age of childhood among the Greeks, and 
I consider the Odyssey ranks in the first place. 
I am indebted to the Odyssey for one of the happiest ex- 
periences of my life, and in a great degree for my love of 
education. This experience did not teach me the motive; that I 
saw before, clearly enough to begin my work as a teacher by 
allowing two boys, one nine, the other not yet eight years old, 
to lay their Eutropius aside, and requiring from them Greek 
instead, even Homer at once, without any so-called preparation 
by the hotch-potch of text-books. JI erred in keeping far too 
closely to the routine of schools, exacting accurate grammatical 
analysis, when for this beginning only the principal signs of 
inflection ought to have been taught and explained with un- 
tiring repetition, rather than demanded again and again from 
the boy by pressing questions. I lacked all preparation in 
history and mythology, so necessary to make exposition easier, 
and so easily furnished by a student who possesses true educa- 
tional tact. Many an injurious breeze from afar disturbed me 
much in my surroundings, which I can now but silently thank, 
was favourable to me. But nothing can destroy my hope that 
the good natures of healthy boys are not to be considered such 
rarities, but will stand the greater number of educators in good 
stead as they stood me. Andwhile I can easily imagine a much 
greater art in carrying out the task than my first attempt can 
boast, I believe I learned from my experience (for which the 
reading of the Odyssey required a year and a half) that this 
commencement in private tuition is as practicable as it is 
wholesome, and that it must ordinarily succeed in this sphere, 
if teachers, who approach the subject not only in the philo- 
logical but also in the educational spirit, will lay down some 
rules by way of help and foresight, more minutely than time 
and space at present permit me to do. 1 cannot determine 
what is possible in schools, but were I in the position to do so, 
1 Herbart has been referring here to his early experiences as private 
tutor to Herr von Steiger’s sons. With their father’s approval he allowed 
the two younger boys, Karl and Rudolph, to give up Eutropius and read the 
Odyssey, of course in the original and without further preparation, with the 
results he describes. 
 
-P-A-G-E-111
  Introduction. QI 
  I would make the attempt with courage, and with the firm 
conviction, that even if the result were failure, the evil could 
not be greater than arises from the customary study of Latin 
grammar and Roman authors, of which not one exists even 
passably suitable for guiding a boy at any period of his childhood 
into the ages of antiquity. They may conveniently follow, if 
Homer and a few other Greeks have gone before. But a con- 
siderable amount of learned confusion is shown in the manner 
in which they have hitherto been used, and in tolerating for the 
sake of an instruction so wholly wanting in all educational 
value, so much labour for so many years, so much sacrifice of 
good humour and of all free movement of the mind. I appeal 
to many educational reviews more easily forgotten than con- 
futed, which at any rate exposed this great evil, even if they 
did not at once know a suitable remedy. 
The preceding is sufficient to afford a preliminary acquaint- 
ance with this proposal; it is not sufficient to exhibit it in its 
infinitely numerous relations. It would be but a beginning, 
were any one inclined to grasp the whole of the present volume 
in one thought, and carry that thought about with him for 
many years. I at least have not given expression hurriedly to 
my experience. My attempt began more than eight years ago, 
and since then I have had time to consider it. 
Let us rise to a general consideration of the subject. Let us 
look on the Odyssey as the point of touch in a fellowship be- 
tween pupil and teacher, which, while it elevates the one in his 
own sphere, no longer depresses the other, and while it guides 
the one farther and farther through a classical world, yields 
the other a most interesting picture in the imitative progress 
of the boy, of the great development of humanity, and lastly 
prepares a store of recollections, which, associated with this 
eternal work of genius, must be re-awakened at each return to 
it. In lke manner, a familiar star recalls the hours to friends, 
when they were wont to observe it together. 
Is it, however, a small matter that the enthusiasm of the 
teacher should be enhanced by the choice of the matter taught ? 
It is asked that the teacher shall be relieved of external pres- 
sure; but more than half of this is left undone, if the pedantry 
 
-P-A-G-E-112
  92 Science of Education. 
which repels active minds and clings to sluggish ones be not 
swept away. 
This spirit of pedantry which mingles so easily with edau- 
cation is highly destructive to it. It is of two kinds. The 
commoner clings to unimportant matters; it trumpets forth 
methods, when it has only invented new games. The other 
kind is more subtle and corrupting; it sees the important, but 
does not distinguish between the temporary and enduring. To 
it a single act of naughtiness is a fault of character, and to 
beneficially correct the pupils once or twice is the art of moral 
education! How can we think such proceedings other than 
harmful, when we remember, that even the most violent emo- 
tions of the deepest souls (which the educator truly has in his 
power, and which must often be made use of with robust 
natures) so quickly subside. He who considers only the quality 
of the impressions, and not their quantity, will waste his most 
careful reflections and his most skilful arrangements. It is 
true, nothing in the human mind is lost, but very little is 
present in consciousness at the same time; that which is essen- 
tially strong, which has many relationships, alone rises up 
frequently or easily before the soul, and only that which is most 
prominent impels to action. And the impulses, which indivi- 
dually affect the mind powerfully, are so many and of such 
diverse kinds in the long years of youth, that the strongest 
will be overpowered, if time does not renew them, and do so in 
many fresh ways. Only that is dangerous individually, which 
cools the heart of the pupil towards the person of the teacher, 
just because personality multiplies itself with every word, with 
every look. But even this union can in due time be again 
effected, though not without great and tender care. Other 
impressions, however skilfully occasioned, only move the char- 
acter quite uselessly from its wonted position; it bounds back 
again, feeling as when one laughs over an empty fear. 
And this all leads us back to the proposition—those only 
wield the full power of education, who know how to cultivate 
in the youthful soul a large circle of thought closely connected 
in all its parts, possessing the power of overcoming what is un- 
favourable in the environment, and of dissolving and absorbing 
 
-P-A-G-E-113
    Lntroduction. 93 
  into itself all that is favourable! It is true that only private 
tuition under favourable conditions can ensure opportunity to 
the skill of the teacher; may those opportunities that really 
occur be utilised. From the examples here given, more may 
be learned. Above all, however people may struggle against 
it, the world depends on but a few—a few rightly cultured 
ones can guide it aright ! 
Where this art of education is wanting, the chief thing is to 
discover, and if possible to guide, the existing sources of the 
chief impressions. Those who can recognise how the general 
appears in the individual, will be able to gather from the 
general plan what is practicable, by referring man to humanity, 
the part to the whole, and by then contracting the great into 
the less and still less according to the laws of their propor- 
tions. 
Humanity educates itself continuously by the circle of 
thought which it begets.2 If the manifold be loosely combined 
in this circle of thought, its working as a whole will be weak, 
and individual singularities, incongruous as they are, will 
excite restlessness and violence. If the manifold be contradic- 
tory, then useless argument results, which insensibly abandons 
to undisciplined desire the power for which it strives. Only 
when thinkers are at one, can reason—only when the good are 
at one also, can good—be victorious. 
1 This thought forms the basis of the Allg. Pdidagogik, and must never 
be lost sight of by the reader. Still more forcibly is it given by Herbart in 
his work, Mein Streit mit den Modephilosophen, ‘Instruction will form the 
circle of thought, and education the character. The last is nothing without 
the first; herein is contained the whole sum of my Pedagogy.” (Herbart’s 
Pddagogische Schriften, edited by Professor Willman.) 
2 Herbart expresses this thought again as follows: ‘‘In the old and the 
uniform, in what always repeats itself during immeasurable centuries with 
some progress, lies the nature of Man, and therein must we seek for the 
gifts of God. According to the divine order, man comes helpless into the 
world, but capable of cultivation by language, family, reciprocal needs, ac- 
cumulated experience, discovered arts, existing science, the works of genius 
from all preceding ages, which the longer their duration must the more 
uniformly influence ages to come. Humanity becomes ever more matured, 
living on always under the same sun, on the same earth. The salutary 
powers by means of which it ripens, are, although the least observed, ever 
the same, and ever active.’’ (Rede iiber Fichte’s Ansicht der Weltgeschichte.)

THE AIM OF EDUCATION GENERALLY. 
  
CHAPTER I. 
THE GOVERNMENT OF CHILDREN. 
Ir may be doubted whether this chapter belongs on the whole 
to the science of education, and should not rather be subjoined 
to those divisions of practical philosophy which treat of govern- 
ment in general. Care for intellectual culture is, in fact, 
essentially different from care for the maintenance of order. 
If the former bears the name of education, if it requires special 
artists, i.e. educators, if finally all artistic work must be separ- 
ated from all heterogeneous work, that it may be brought to 
perfection by the concentrated power of genius, then we must 
desire no less for the good cause itself than for clearness of 
conception, that they upon whom devolves the task of training 
with their insight and energy the inmost minds of children, 
should be relieved from the government of them. But to keep 
children in order is a burden which parents willingly cast off, 
and which perhaps appears to many who are condemned to 
live with children as the most agreeable part of their duty, 
since it gives them an opportunity to compensate themselves in 
some degree by a little tyranny over others for the oppression 
which they suffer from without. An author, therefore, who 
omits this from his theory of education at once exposes himself 
to the charge that he does not know how to educate. And, in 
truth, he must perforce blame himself; for though these 
diverse functions are but badly performed when associated 
together, yet in actual practice it is impossible to separate 
them entirely. Government which is satisfied without educat- 
ing, oppresses the mind, and education which takes no heed of 
the disorderly conduct of children, would not be recognized as 
such by the children themselves. Besides, no lessor. ean be 
94

given in which the holding of the reins of government by a firm 
yet gentle hand can be dispensed with. 
Finally, if the educator proper and the parents are each to 
take their due share in the children’s bringing up, they must 
take care duly to determine the mutual assistance which each 
must give the other on either side of the partition line. 
I, 
Aim of the Government of Children. 
The child enters the world without a will of its own, and is 
therefore incapable of any moral relation. Consequently the 
parents (partly spontaneously, partly agreeably to the demand 
of society) can make themselves master of it as of a chattel. 
It is true they know well that in the being whom they now, 
without asking, treat as they like, a Will in the course of time 
will put itself forth, which they must win over to themselves 
if the incongruity of a conflict unseemly to both is to be avoided. 
But it is long before this takes place. At first, instead of a 
true will, which renders the child capable of determination, 
there is only a wild impetuosity, impelling it hither and 
thither, a principle of disorder, disturbing the plans of the 
adults, and placing the future personality of the child itself in 
manifold dangers. This impetuosity must be subdued, or the 
disorderly character will be put down as the fault of the child’s 
guardians. Subjection is brought about by force, and the 
force must be sufficiently strong, and often enough repeated, to 
compass this subjection before any trace of a true will is mani- 
fested in the child. The principles of practical philosophy 
require this. 
But the germs of this blind impulsiveness, these crude 
desires, remain in the child, and even increase and grow 
stronger with time. To the end, therefore, that they may not 
give to the will growing up in their midst an anti-social direc- 
tion, it is necessary to keep them constantly under an ever- 
perceptible restraint.! 
1 By means of this restraint what Herbart calls ‘‘ formal morality ”’ is first 
of all engendered in the child, which morality he thus defines in the 
 
-P-A-G-E-116
  96 Science of Education. 
An adult trained to reason undertakes, as time goes on, to 
govern himself. There are human beings, however, who never 
reach this point, and society keeps such under perpetual guar- 
dianship, calling some idiots, some prodigals. Some there 
are who actually cultivate in themselves an anti-social will; 
with such society is inevitably at war, and generally they are 
justly worsted in the end. But the conflict is a moral evil for 
society itself, to prevent which child-government is one among 
numerous necessary precautions. 
It is obvious that the aim of child-government is manifold— 
partly avoidance of harm both for others and for the child him- 
self in the present and the future, partly avoidance of strife as 
an evil in itself, finally avoidance of collision, in which society 
finds itself forced into a contest for which it is not perfectly 
authorized. 
It all amounts to this, that such government aims at pro- 
ducing no result in the mind (Gemiith') of the child, but only 
at creating a spirit of order. Nevertheless, it will soon be 
clear, that the cultivation of the child-soul cannot be altogether 
a matter of indifference to government. 
II. 
Means of Child-government. 
The first measure that all government has to take is the 
threat of punishment, and in its use all government runs the 
danger of striking,on one of two rocks: on the one side there 
Aphorismen zur Pidagogik: ‘‘ Formal morality is properly only respect for 
the relationships we find outside our own individuality, and by which the 
objects of will are given through the desires. With this morality the indi- 
vidual only looks upon himself as one obeying, and submits himself to a 
higher criticism. He does not find the genera] will in his own consciousness, 
therefore does not immediately accept its affairs so absolutely as his own, 
His individual will is sufficient for his activity, and would only be restrained 
by the moral. But morality as a mere law of censure is not the principle 
of a steady and complete activity, and such a principle pedagogy still needs. 
Formal morality arises inevitably when earlier moral culture has been 
absent. The moral is afterwards added as a doctrine, and acknowledged, 
but it never becomes a part of the nature.” 
1 «¢Gemiith,” translated mind, includes both the intellectual and emo- 
tional sides of the disposition.

The Aim of Education generally. 97 
  are strong natures who despise all threats, and dare everything 
to gain their will; on the other there are natures—a far greater 
number—who are too weak to be impressed by threats, and in 
whom fear itself is subservient to desire. This twofold un- 
certainty of the result cannot be avoided. 
The rare instances in which the government of children , 
strikes on the first rock are not really to be regretted, provided 
that it is not too late to make use of such splendid opportunities 
for education proper. But the weakness and forgetfulness of 
childish frivolity make mere threats so extremely untrust- 
worthy, that supervision has long ago been considered as the 
most indispensable part of child-government.! 
I hardly dare express my opinion openly about supervision. 
I will at least not state it strongly in detail, otherwise parents 
and teachers might seriously credit this book with a considerable 
power of doing harm. Perhaps it has been my misfortune to 
witness too many examples of the effect of strict supervision in 
public institutions, and perhaps, having due regard to safety of 
life and strength of limb, I am too much possessed with the idea 
that boys and youths must be allowed to run risks, if they are 
to become men. Snuffice it briefly to remember that punctilious 
and eonstant supervision is burdensome alike to the supervisor 
and those he watches over, and is apt therefore to be associated 
on both sides with deceit, and thrown off at every opportunity 
—and also that the need for it grows with the degree in which 
it is used, and that at last every moment of its intermittance is 
fraught with danger. Further, it prevents children from know- 
ing and testing themselves, and learning a thousand things 
1 Herbart further expresses himself on this point in the Aphor. zur Pdda- 
gogik ; ‘* Supervision, prohibition, restraint, checking by threats, are only 
the negative measures of education. The old pedagogy betrayed its weak- 
ness in nothing so much as in its dependence on compulsion, the modern 
in nothing so much as in the emphatic value it places on supervision. Great 
perplexity can alone be the motive for exclusively recommending a measure 
at once so prejudicial, insufficient, and costly. Hindrance of offences is 
only good when a new activity continually takes the place of that which is 
restrained, The individual ought not to be too simple, too incapable, too 
indolent to commit faults, otherwise virtue would be at an end also.” 
Herbart is here again opposed to the philanthropinists, who considered strict, 
supervision to be of the highest importance.

  which are not included in any pedagogic system, but can only 
be found by self-search. Finally, for all these reasons, the 
character which is formed outside the will of its possessor, 
either remains weak or distorted, according as the outlets which 
the individual finds be many or few.! Such is the result of 
long-continued supervision. That result seldom occurs during 
the earliest years, or during short periods of special danger, 
when, of course, supervision becomes a strict duty. In such 
cases, which are to be considered exceptional, the most con- 
scientious and untiring observers must be chosen; not real 
teachers, who would here be out of place, the more so that we 
cannot assume that such cases would give any opportunity for 
the exercise of their powers. From those who grow up under 
the oppression of constant observation, no versatility, no inven- 
tive power, no spirit of daring, no confident demeanour can be 
expected. We can only expect: human beings of simple, un- 
varied temperament, to whom the flat monotonous round of 
prescribed business is pleasant and right, who would shrink 
from all that is elevated and peculiar, and give themselves up 
to all that is commonplace and comfortable. Those who so far 
agree with me in this must be careful not to think for a moment 
that they can claim to form great characters, because they leave 
their children to run wild without supervision and without 
culture. Education is a vast whole of ceaseless labour, which 
exacts true proportion from beginning to end; merely to avoid 
a few errors is of no avail. 
Perhaps I shall come more into harmony with other teachers 
when I pass to the means of help which must be prepared in 
the children’s minds themselves by government—I mean 
authority and love. 
‘The mind bends to authority; its peculiar movements are 
constrained by it, and it may thus be of considerable service in 
1 The teacher’s requirements must not become the pupil’s constant 
thought. For not these, but the true relationship of things ought to be the 
motive of his actions and the principle of his idea. This applies to early 
youth. Even little children learn to mingle the by-thoughts they have of the 
people about them in all they do, to such an extent that they are no longer 
capable of an unmixed feeling.”—Aphor. zur Pddagogik.

suppressing a growing will which tends to perverseness. It can 
be least dispensed with in the case of the most energetic natures, 
for these make trial of the bad as well as the good, and pursue 
the good if they are not lost in the bad. But authority is only 
obtained through superiority of mind, and this, as is well known, 
cannot be reduced to rules. It must act independently, with- 
out reference to education. A logical and far-reaching course 
of action once prescribed, must openly and freely take its own 
straight course, regardful of circumstances, but undisturbed, 
untroubled by the likes or dislikes of a weaker will. If 
the careless boy breaks rudely into the prescribed circle, he 
must be made to feel what he might spoil. If the wanton 
desire to spoil arises in him, the intention, so far as it becomes 
or could become act, must be richly punished; but the teacher 
must scorn to take any notice of the bad will together with the 
insult implied therein. To wound the desire to do evil, which 
the government of children is as powerless as the State to 
punish, with the deep disapproval it deserves, is the business 
of education, which only begins after government has done its 
work. For the way to utilise authority once attained, we 
must look beyond government to education proper. For though 
mental culture gains nothing directly from passive obedience 
to authority, the marking out or enlargement of the circle of 
thought which depends upon it, and in which the pupil moves 
freely and builds up himself independently, is of the highest 
importance. 
Love depends on the harmony of the feelings and on habit 
The difficulty a stranger finds in winning it at once becomes 
apparent. He who secludes himself, who speaks much in hard 
tones, and becomes excited about trifles, will assuredly never 
gain it; nor, on the other hand, will he who makes himself 
familiar—who, when he should be kind and yet at the same time 
maintain his ascendancy, seeks his own pleasure by taking part 
in the enjoyment of the children. The harmony of feelings 
love demands, may arise in two ways. Hither the teacher enters 
into the feelings of the pupil, and without permitting it to be 
noticed, joins in them with tact, or he takes care that the feel- 
ings of the pupil can approach his own in some particular way;
-P-A-G-E-120
  100 Science of Education. 
this is more difficult, but must nevertheless be combined with 
the other, because only when it is possible for the pupil to unite 
his activity in some way or other with the teacher’s can he 
contribute force of his own to the relationship between them. 
But a boy’s love is transitory and fitful unless sufficient 
strength of habit be added. Time, tender care, intercourse 
alone with the individual strengthens the relationship. We 
need not say how much this love, once won, lightens the task of 
government; but it is so important to education proper (since 
it imparts to the pupil the teacher’s bent of mind), that those 
deserve the severest blame who so readily and so fatally make 
use of it to gratify themselves by the exhibition of their power 
over their children. 
Authority belongs most naturally to the father. In him 
whom all follow, to whom all turn for direction, by whom the 
domestic arrangements are determined and altered, or rather 
to whom they are made subservient by the mother—in him 
there most visibly arises that rightful ascendancy of mind, 
which has the power to depress or gladden with a few words 
of disapproval or of approbation. 
Love belongs most naturally to the mother, to her who 
with endless sacrifices discovers and comes to understand the 
child’s needs as none other can, between whom and the child a 
language grows up and is developed, which far sooner than any 
other can find ways of communication with the little one, who, 
favoured by the tenderness of her sex, knows so well how to 
strike the accordant tone in the feelings of her child, and whose 
gentle power, if never misused, can never fail of its effect. 
If then authority and love are the best means of maintaining 
the effect of the child’s earliest subjection, so far as its further 
government requires, it then of necessity follows, firstly, that 
this government will be best left in the hands of those to whom 
nature has entrusted it; but, on the other hand, that education 
proper, especially the culture of the circle of thought, can only 
be given by those who have special practice in traversing in all 
directions the realms of human thought, and can distinguish 
with the truest sense of proportion what is nobler, what is 
more profound, what is easier and what more difficult therein. 
 
-P-A-G-E-121
The Aim of Education generally. 101 
As, however, authority and love have so much indirect power 
over education, the fashioner of the mind, in whom at best 
only an ever limited trust is placed, should not in his pride 
desire to carry on his profession by himself alone, to the exclu- 
sion of the parents ; he would thereby lose the power of their 
influence, for the loss of which he cannot easily find a com- 
pensation. 
If, however, the government of children must devolve on 
persons other than the parents, it is important to carry it on 
with as little friction as possible. This depends on the propor- 
tion which the children’s activity bears to the amount of free 
play they get. In towns, contact with many men may be very 
harmful to children; they must be kept within due limits, and 
this so much the more because activity is increased and excited 
by the example so many children together set each other. 
Nowhere, therefore, is government more difficult than in insti- 
tutions in towns, which are, indeed, called educational establish- 
ments, but with really hardly any claim to the title, for where 
even government is so difficult, what can be done for education P 
In the country, on the contrary, establishments can utilise the 
advantage given by the freer scope for the children’s activity, 
if only the responsibility for so many children did not lead 
their directors to enact so many, often over-solicitous regu- 
lations, which, with the object of shielding from possible evil, 
result in the surest and most universal harm. With good 
reason, however, teachers have long turned their attention to 
supplying children with many pleasant and harmless occupa- 
tions, to provide an outlet for restlessness which cannot be pent 
up. So much has been said on this subject, that I need not 
hesitate to be silent about it. When the environment is so 
arranged, that childish activity can itself find the track of the 
useful and spend itself thereon, then government is most 
successful.

  TIT. 
Government superseded by Education. 
Threats, in case of need enforced by compulsion, supervision 
by persons who are generally cognisant of the dangers to which 
children are liable—authority and love combined—these powers 
will pretty easily obtain a certain degree of ascendancy over 
children; but the more tightly the string is already strung, the 
more power is proportionately required to screw it up to its true 
note. Instant obedience following a command on the spot and 
with entire acquiescence, which teachers, not wholly without 
reason, look upon as their triumph—who would force this from 
children by merely cramping regulations as well as military 
severity? Such obedience can only in reason be associated 
with the child’s own will; this, however, is only to be expected as 
the result of a somewhat advanced stage of genuine education. 
Assuming the pupil has already a lively sense of the gain 
which intellectual guidance brings him, and of the loss which 
he will suffer from every deprivation, or indeed, diminution of 
it,! he may then be shown that as a condition of the continuance 
of this guidance, a perfectly stable relationship is requisite, 
which can be calculated upon in all instances; and that the 
teacher must be able to confidently assume there will be 
instant obedience as soon as he has ground for requiring it. 
There is now no question at all of mere blind obedience; 
that is not consistent with any friendly relationship. But 
everywhere there occur cases in which only one can decide, 
and the others must follow without opposition. This neverthe- 
less must be followed at the first opportunity by an explanation 
1 Compare with this the following from Aphor. zum Pidagogik: ‘‘ Every- 
thing must appear to the boy as his work; he must wish to feel he has 
himself to thank for his improvement. The years from ten to fourteen, 
when the boy feels intensely he must be educated, are very important. If 
these are neglected, formation by education is lost. Earlier, from the 
sixth year onwards, it is difficult to awake and maintain this spirit in the 
child ; and in the pupil’s seventeenth year education proper is impossible, 
or at most only possible in those who see what they have missed, and in 
whom the wish to submit themselves to education is keen. This feeling, 
however, will not last long, at least not beyond the time that they feel they 
can carry on their education for themselves.
-P-A-G-E-123

why that decision was arrived at and no other, so that the 
pupil’s future judgment may meet the command half way. 
Conviction of the necessity of subordination must therefore 
concede what the teacher for himself would not dare to ask. 
It is likewise with education. The strange teacher entirely 
compromises himself when he appears to arrogate to himself an 
authority which is neither derived from the parents nor yielded 
by the pupil. 
IV. 
Preliminary Glance at Education Proper in contrast with 
Government. 
Education proper is cognisant, like government, of something 
which may be called compulsion; it is indeed never harsh, but 
often very strict. Its extreme expression is by the mere words, 
I will, which soon comes to mean, without express addition, I 
wish; so that both expressions need great discretion in their 
use. For they demand something from the pupil which can 
only be exceptional, namely submission, following on the com- 
munication and mutual consideration of the reasons for it. 
These two expressions thus denote a rare dissatisfaction of the 
teacher and unusual causes for it, which must be sought for 
in order to be reckoned with. 
Education makes itself quite as oppressive, though less 
abruptly so, by constantly exacting that which is unwillingly 
done, and by obstinately ignoring the wishes of the pupil. In 
this, as in the former case, the teacher reminds the pupil in 
silence, or, if necessary, aloud, of the pre-existing contract: 
“Our relationship exists and endures only on such and such 
conditions.” This, it must be admitted, has no meaning if the 
teacher does not know how to secure for himself a certain free 
position. This is soon followed by the withdrawal of the custo- 
mary signs of courtesy and approbation. Such customary signs 
presuppose that as a rule the pupil will be treated as a human 
being, with ordinary kindness, and perhaps, as a lovable boy, 
with all the affectionate sympathy he deserves. This includes 
the yet wider presumption that the teacher has taste and a 
feeling for all the beauty and attractiveness that humanity and 
 
-P-A-G-E-124
  104 Science of Education. 
  youth may possess. The sour-tempered person who is insen- 
sible to this feeling would do better to avoid the young—he 
does not so much as understand how to look at them with 
proper consideration. Only he who receives much, and’ is 
therefore able to give much, can also deprive of much, and by 
such pressure mould the disposition and direct the attention 
of the youthful mind according to his own judgment. 
But he will not guide it without sacrificing to a great extent 
the liberty of his own disposition. If he is always coldly indif- 
ferent, how can the boy, wandering by himself in the noonday 
of carelessness and growing physical strength, be imbued with 
the fine shades of intellectual activity, without which there can 
be no living sympathy, no refined taste, no true penetration nor 
spirit of observation? Very few natures pass of themselves 
out of the shallowness which constitutes what we call common- 
place; and except as imparted to them, fewer still attain to the 
spirit of discrimination, whose work it is to cultivate within and 
without. The teacher, therefore, must stimulate the boy by 
analysing him; he must reflect on him hfs own picture, rich in 
the expanding and restraining power which impels and controls 
a youth commencing his own culture. And whence is he to 
obtain this power, except from his own emotional soul? The 
first advance out of mental crudeness is made by a boy when 
he experiences afterwards how such and such ideas expressed by 
himself affected the teacher, and this is the most direct benefit 
of education. But for the teacher to experience it beforehand 
demands a painful change of personal feeling which is no longer 
becoming to the grown man, and is only suitable and natural 
to those who are still in the period of striving after cultivation. 
Education, therefore, is the business of young men in the years 
when susceptibility to self-criticism is at its height, and when 
it is indeed, an untold help to the teacher in looking at a 
younger generation, to have the unexhausted wealth of human 
capacities at his disposal, with the whole problem of making the 
possible, real, and of educating himself with the boy. This sus- 
ceptibility cannot but disappear in time, whether it be because 
he has become satiated, or because hope sinks and work presses. 
With it disappears the power and the inclination to educate.

Circumstances decide whether much or little speech be 
necessary for the expression of individual emotion. A reserved 
character which never overflows in speech, a helpless organ 
without depth or height, a style without a variety of turns, and 
incapable of expressing disapproval with dignity, and approba- 
tion with hearty sincerity, would leave the best will in the 
lurch, and land the finest feeling in perplexity. The process 
of education requires that much should be spoken, and often 
spoken without preparation. Artificial ornamentation it can 
dispense with, but it cannot altogether dispense with form. 
How often is impressiveness needful—impressiveness which 
must be free from harshness! Whence can it spring, except from 
some unexpected source; from a seriousness which deepens as 
it develops, and causes solicitude as to its ultimate end—from 
measures which will build up or destroy something that must 
remain either as a memory of disappointed or of fulfilled hopes P 
The teacher retires into himself, tears himself free by force as 
from a false relationship, which seems to mock him; or he 
comes out of himself, and rises above the trivial, which was 
too narrow for him. The pupil sees the torn threads lying; 
“looking before and after,” the right principle or the true 
means begin to appear indistinctly before him; and when he 
is ready to seize and restore them, the teacher hastens to meet 
him, dissipates the darkness, helps to unite what is severed, to 
smooth difficulties, and to strengthen the wavering. These 
expressions are too general, too figurative; create for your- 
selves examples to illustrate them. 
Only let there be no wearisome sulkiness, no artificial gravity, 
no mystical reserve, and, above all, no false friendliness. 
Honesty must be the soul of all activity, however numerous 
its changes of direction may be. 
The pupil will have to test the teacher in many ways, before 
there grows up that subtle tractability which ought to spring 
from mere knowledge of, and regard for his feelings. When, 
1 Herbart used and tested the value of this treatment with the three 
pupils before alluded to, of which we have abundant proof in his letters 
to their father. 
 
-P-A-G-E-126

however, it is manifested, the teacher’s attitude must be more 
steadfast, more equable; he must not lay himself open to the 
suspicion that no enduring relationship is possible with him, or 
that his heart is not a safe resting-place. 
CHAPTER II, 
EDUCATION PROPER. 
Tue art of arousing a child’s mind from its repose—of securing 
its trust and love in order to constrain and excite it at pleasure, 
and to plunge it into the whirl of later years before its time, 
would be the most hateful of all bad arts, if it had not an aim 
to attain, which can justify such means even in the eyes of those 
whose reproof is most to be feared. ‘“ You will be thankful for 
it some day,” says the teacher to the weeping boy, and truly it 
is only this hope that justifies the tears wrung from him. Let 
him be careful that, in overweening confidence, he does not too 
frequently have recourse to such severe measures. Not all that 
is well meant is thankfully received, and there is a weak spot 
in the class of that teacher, who, with perverted zeal, considers 
that as good which his pupils only experience as evil. Hence 
the warning—do not educate too much; refrain from all avoid- 
able application of that power by which the teacher bends his 
pupils this way and that, dominates their dispositions, and 
destroys their cheerfulness. For thus, the subsequent happy 
recollection of childhood will also be destroyed, and that frank 
gratitude which is a teacher’s only true thanks. 
Is it then better not to educate at all? to confine ourselves to 
government, and limit even this to what is absolutely neces- 
sary? If every one were candid, many would agree to this. 
The praise already given to England would be repeated; and if 
once it became a question of praising, excuses would be found 
for the lack of government, which allows so much license to 
young gentlemen of position in that happy island. But let us 
put aside all disputes. The sole question for us is, can we 
know beforehand the aims of the future man, a knowledge for 
 
-P-A-G-E-127
  
  The Aim of Education generally. 107 
  which he will one day thank us, instead of having had to find and 
follow them by himself alone? If so, no further foundation is 
needed—we love the children, and in them, the men; love does 
not love doubts any more than it cares to wait for the categori- 
cal imperative.! 
I. 
Is the Aim of Education Single or Manifold ? 
The effort to attain scientific unity often misleads the thinker 
to artificially force into connection with each other, and deduce 
from each other, things only lying side by side, and in themselves 
many and distinct. People are even carried away into com- 
mitting the mistake of inferring unity of things from unity of 
knowledge, and of postulating the former with the latter. Such 
a misconception does not affect the science of education ; so much 
the more does the need exist of being able to grasp in one 
conception the whole idea of a work like that of education, so 
immeasurably manifold, and yet so intimately connected in all 
its parts. For from such a conception proceeds unity of plan 
and concentrated power. Looking then at the results which edu- 
cational research must show, in order to be completely service- 
able, we are driven to presuppose and require for that unity, 
which the result cannot dispense with, a corresponding unity 
in the principle from which it may be anticipated. The ques- 
tion, therefore, is twofold *—firstly, if such a principle of unity 
exists, whether the method of constructing a science on the 
basis of one conception is known. Secondly, if such a prin- 
1 By the ‘ categorical imperative’? Kant means the moral law, so far as, in- 
dependent of the external world and of every other command and considera- 
tion, it commands, and with its Thou shalt claims unlimited, unconditional, 
obedience. Instead of beginning with this absolute ‘shall,’ Herbart de- 
manded that moral teaching should exhibit the highest point of view of will- 
ing and action, the determining judgments regarding the Good and Bad, the 
moral aims of internal and external activity—and while doing so himself, he 
arrived at his doctrine of ideas (Herbart’s Péddagogische Schriften, Anmer- 
kung von Karl Richter, 80). 
2 The contradiction between “‘ the twofold question’ and the enumeration 
of three points immediately after, is found also in Herbart’s works collected 
by Hartenstein, who had the written remains of the philosopher at his dis- 
posal for reference. The oversight was therefore Herbart’s own.
-P-A-G-E-128
108 Science of Education. 
  ciple offers itself here, whether it contains by implication the 
entire science. Thirdly, whether this construction of the science, 
and this view which it affords, is the only one, or whether there 
be others which, although suitable in a less degree, are still 
natural, and which, therefore, cannot be excluded. I have in a 
treatise,! which is appended to the second edition of my A BO of 
Observation (A BC der Anschauung) treated the highest aim 
of education—morality—according to this method which there 
seemed necessary. I must beg my readers with all due respect 
to compare carefully that work—yes, even the whole of it—with 
the present one; or, at least, to avoid repetition, I must pre- 
sume they have done so. To understand that treatise properly 
it is before all things necessary to observe the manner in which 
moral culture is related to the other parts of culture, that is to 
say, how it (moral culture) presupposes them as conditions 
from which alone it can with certainty be developed. Unpre- 
judiced persons will I hope, easily see that the problem of 
moral education is not separable from education as a whole, but 
that it stands in a necessary, far-reaching connection with the 
remaining problems of education. But the treatise itself shows 
that this connection does not affect all parts of education in 
such a degree that we have reason to foster those parts only in 
so far as they stand in this connection. Other aspects of the 
direct worth of general education, which we are not justified 
in sacrificing, come now to the front. I therefore believe 
that the mode of consideration which places morality at the 
head is certainly the most important, but not the only and 
comprehensive, standpoint of education. It must be added 
that if the examination which is begun in that treatise were to 
be prosecuted, it would lead straight through a complete system 
of philosophy. But education has no time to make holiday 
now, till philosophical questions are once for all cleared up. 
Rather is it to be desired that pedagogy shall be kept as free as 
possible from philosophical doubts. For all these reasons, I 
here take a course which will be easier and less misleading for 
the reader, and which touches more directly upon all parts of 
1 The Aisthetic Revelation of The World. 
 
-P-A-G-E-129
  The Aim of Education generally. 109 
the science, but which is disadvantageous for the final thinking 
out and co-ordination of the whole to the extent that some 
residue of isolated considerations remain, and something is 
lacking to the perfect unity of the manifold. So much then for 
those who feel themselves called upon to sit in judgment on, or 
better still, to erect a science of education out of their own 
means. 
‘ It is impossible, from the nature of the case, that unity 
in the aim of education can follow; simply, because everything 
must proceed from the single thought, namely, that the teacher 
must represent the future man in the boy, consequently the aims 
which the pupil will as an adult place before himself in the future 
must be the present care of the teacher; he must prepare beforehand 
an inward facility for attaining them. He ought not to stunt 
the activity of the future man; consequently he ought not to 
confine it to single points, and just as little weaken it by too 
much diversity. He ought to allow nothing to be lost, either 
in Intension or Extension, which his pupil might afterwards 
demand back from him. However great or little these difficul- 
ties may be, so much is clear—since human aims are manifold, 
the teacher’s cares must be manifold also. 
It is not however, here contended that the multiplicities of 
education cannot easily be classified under one or a few main 
formal conceptions;' on the contrary, the kingdom of the 
pupil’s future aims at once divides itself for us into the province 
of merely possible ams which he might perhaps take up at one 
time or other and pursue in greater or less degree as he wishes 
—and into the entirely distinct province of the necessary aims 
which he would never pardon himself for having neglected. In 
one word, the aim of education is sub-divided according to the 
aims of choice—not of the teacher, nor of the boy, but of the 
future man, and the aims of morality. These two main head- 
ings are at once clear to every one who bears in mind the most 
generally recognised of the fundamental principles of ethics. 
1 Note by Herbart.—‘“ I must, from scientific considerations, here observe 
that I do not give the name of Principle to those Concepts and Propositions 
to which we can only subordinate a manifold which does not follow from 
them by strict necessity.”

  Il. 
Many-sidedness of Interest—Strength of Moral Character. 
(1) How can the teacher assume for himself beforehand the 
merely possible future aims of the pupil P 
The objective of these aims as matter of mere choice has abso- 
lutely no interest for the teacher. Only the Will of the future 
man himself, and consequently the sum of the claims which he, 
in, and with, this Will, will make on himself, is the object of the 
teacher’s goodwill; while the power, the initiative inclination, 
the activity which the future man will have wherewith to meet 
these claims on himself, form for the teacher matter for con- 
_ sideration and judgment in accordance with the idea of perfec- 
tion Thus it is not acertain number of separate aims that 
hover before us now (for these we could not beforehand 
thoroughly know), but chiefly the activity of the growing man 
—the totality of his inward unconditioned vitality and sus- 
ceptibility. The greater this totality—the fuller, more expanded, 
and harmonious—the greater is the perfection, and the greater 
the promise of the realisation of our good will. 
Only the flower must not burst its calyx—the fulness must 
not become weakness through being too long scattered in many 
directions. Human society has long found division of labour 
to be necessary, that every one may make what he attempts 
perfect. But the more limited, the more sub-divided that 
which is to be accomplished, the more manifold is that which 
each receives from all the rest. Since, then, intellectual recep- 
tivity rests on affinity of mind, and this again on similar activi- 
ties of mind, it follows that in the higher realm of true 
humanity, labour ought not to be divided up to the point where 
each man is ignorant of his neighbour’s work. Every man must 
have a love for all activities, each must be a virtuoso in one. 
But the particular virtuosoship is a matter of choice; on the 
contrary, the manifold receptivity which can only grow out of 
manifold beginnings of one’s own individual efforts, is a matter 
1 See translators’ Introduction, p. 28. Herbart refers here to two of his 
five practical ideas.

  of education. Therefore we call the first part of the educational 
aim—many-sidedness of interest, which must be distinguished 
from its exaggeration—dabbling in many things. And since 
no one object of will, nor its individual direction, interests us 
more than any other, we add to this, lest weakness may offend 
us by appearing by the side of strength, the predicate—propor- 
tionate many-sidedness. We shall thus get at the meaning of 
the common expression, “ harmonious cultivation of all the 
powers,” in connexion with which the question arises, what is 
meant by multiplicity of powers of soul? and also what is sig- 
nified by the harmony of various powers ? ! 
(2) How is the teacher to assume for himself the necessary 
aims of the pupil? 
Since morality has its place singly and only in the individual’s 
will, founded on right insight, it follows of itself, first and fore- 
most, that the work of moral education is not by any means to 
develop a certain external mode of action, but rather insight 
together with corresponding volition in the mind of the pupil.” 
I leave untouched the metaphysical difficulties connected 
with this development. He who understands how to educate, 
forgets them; he who cannot free himself from them, needs 
metaphysics before a science of education, and the outcome of 
his speculations will prove to him whether the idea of educa- 
tion is, or is not, a possible one for him. 
I look at life, and find very many upon whom morality is a 
stunted growth, very few with whom it is the principle of life 
itself. Most men possess a character independent of goodness, 
1 «The interest which a human being feels directly ! is the source of his 
life. To open many such sources, and to cause them to flow forth plen- 
teously and unchecked, is the art of strengthening human life, and at the 
same time of fostering love of one’s kind. If each of these interests is as 
varied as the achievements of many individuals taken together, then the latter 
are united in one bond by a happy necessity. On the contrary, when each 
individual cares only for his own business or avocation, and all besides is 
but means to this end, society is a machine, and each member of it keeps 
his life warm at a single spark, which may be extinguished, and then nothing 
remains but dismal coldness, satiety, and disgust.”—Aphor. zur Pédagogik.

and a plan of life formed only according to their own inclination ; 
they do the good when convenient, and gladly avoid the evil, 
when the better leads to the same goal. Moral principles are 
wearisome to them, because for them nothing follows from 
those principles, except now and again a limitation of their 
course of thought—indeed everything adverse to this limitation 
is welcome to them. The young poacher has their sympathy, 
if he sins with some boldness, and they pardon at the bottom of 
their heart everything which is neither ridiculous nor malicious. 
If it be the object of moral education to lead the pupil into the 
ranks of these, we have an easy task; we need only take care 
that he grows up, without being teased or insulted, in the con- 
sciousness of his power, and receives certain principles of honour, 
which are easily impressed, because they treat of honour not 
as a wearisome acquisition, but as a possession which nature 
makes a present of, and which must be protected and put in 
force on certain occasions, according to conventional forms. 
But who will warrant us that the future man will not himself 
search out the good, to make it the object of his willing, the 
aim of his life, the standard of his self-criticism? Who will 
protect us against the severe judgment which will then overtake 
us? How will it be, if he calls us to account, because we pre- 
sumed to anticipate the chance, which yet, perhaps, might have 
brought about better opportunities of genuine elevation of 
spirit, and would certainly not have caused the delusion that 
education for him is already a thing accomplished. There are 
instances of the kind; and it is never safe to set up as business 
manager for another if we have no mind to do the work well. 
No one at any rate would like to lie under so severe a condem- 
nation from a man of strict moral sense, as he would who has 
arrogated to himself an influence over any one which might 
have made him worse. 
Therefore that the ideas of the right and good in all their 
clearness and purity may become the essential objects of the 
will, that the innermost intrinsic contents of the character— 
the very heart of the personality—shall determine itself accord- 
ing to these ideas, putting back all arbitrary impulses—this and 
nothing less is the aim of moral culture. And although I may

  not be entirely understood, when for brevity’s sake I speak of 
the ideas of the good and right, still, it is well for us that 
morality has at last thrown aside those half measures, to which 
it formerly at times condescended under the guise of the doc- 
trine of happiness. My fundamental thought is thus so far 
clear. 
Til. 
The Individuality of the Pupil as Point of Incidence. 
The teacher aims at the universal; the pupil, however, is an 
individual human being. 
Without compounding the soul out of all kinds of forces, and 
without constructing the brain out of organs! positively use- 
ful and able to relieve the mind of a part of its work, we must 
accept those experiences undisputed, and in their entirety, in 
harmony with which, the spirit, according to the physical form 
in which it is embodied, finds in its functions sundry difficulties, 
and their conversely relative facilities. 
But however much we may be challenged to test the flexi- 
bility of such natures by experiment, and in no way out of 
respect for their superiority to attempt to excuse our own inert- 
ness, we see already that the purest and best presentation of 
humanity shows us at the same time a particular man. Yes, 
and we feel that the individuality must come to the surface, 
if the example of the race is not to appear insignificant by 
the side of the race itself, and fade away as indifferent. And, 
finally, we know how beneficial it is for mankind, that different 
men should resolve upon and prepare for different work. More- 
over the individuality of the youth reveals itself more and more 
under the teacher’s efforts, and fortunate is he (the teacher) 
if that individuality in no way combats his efforts, or, by giving 
them a crooked direction, causes something different to be 
developed, which neither teacher nor pupil would desire. The 
latter fate almost always befals those who have had no experi-

ence in dealing with men, and therefore are ignorant of the way 
in which to treat in the boy, the already existent man. Out of 
all this there results a negative rule in relation to the aim of 
education, which is as important as it is difficult to observe, 7.e. 
to leave the individuality untouched as far as possible. To do 
this, it is absolutely necessary that the teacher should discrim- 
inate his own peculiarities; he should carefully observe the 
occasions when his own wishes and his pupil’s actions do not 
agree, and there is no intrinsic preference either for the one 
or the other. In such cases, his own wishes must at once give 
way, their expression must be suppressed whenever possible. 
Undiscerning parents may drill their sons and daughters 
according to their tastes—they may lay all kinds of varnish 
on the unpolished wood, which in years of independence will 
be roughly rubbed off, but not without pain and injury. The 
true teacher, if he cannot prevent all this, will at least not 
participate in it. His own structure, for which he always 
finds a wide and clear space in the child’s soul, claims his whole 
attention. He will be careful how he undertakes matters for 
which he will earn no thanks ; he cheerfully leaves undiminished 
to the individuality the only glory of which it is capable, 
namely, to be sharply defined and recognisable even to con- 
spicuousness ; he makes it a point of honour that the clear im- 
pression of person, family, birth, and nationality may be seen 
undefaced in the man submitted to his will. 
LY: 
On the Need of Combining the Aims previously distinguished. 
We cannot develop our view of the aim of education from 
one point, without shutting our eyes to the manifold require- 
ments which lie in the nature of the case, for we must at least 
bring back to one point what is to be the aim of a single plan. 
For where otherwise would our work begin, and where end ? 
How can we save it from the urgent claims made upon it every 
moment by widely diverse views? Can any teacher have 
taught thoughtfully without being daily convinced of the deep 
need of singleness of aim? Can any one think of teaching 
 
-P-A-G-E-135
  The Aim of Education generally. 115 
  without being panic-stricken at the mass of varied anxieties and 
problems which present themselves ?P 
Is individuality consistent with many-sidedness ? Can the 
former be preserved, while the latter is cultivated? Indi- 
viduality is angular; many-sidedness is even, smooth, rounded, 
for agreeably to our demand it ought to be proportionately 
cultivated. Individuality is defined and circumscribed ; many- 
sided interest, on the contrary, presses outwards in all direc- 
tions. It must sacrifice itself while individuality remains 
quiescent or is thrust back; the one must move about in all 
directions, while the other remains calm in itself, to rush forth 
impetuously when the time comes. 
In what relation does individuality stand to character P They 
appear either to harmonize with, or directly to exclude each 
other. For it is by his character that one recognizes a man; 
but by his moral character that one ought to recognize him. 
The less moral individual is not cognizable through moral- 
ity, but on the contrary by many other individual traits, and 
just these as it appears make up his character. 
Yes, the worst difficulty of all lies between the two chief 
parts of the educational aim itself. How will many-sidedness 
allow itself to be confined within the narrow bounds of morality, 
and how will the stern simplicity of moral humility bear 
clothing in the gay’ colours of a many-sided interest P 
If ever complaints are made that education is thought out 
and pursued as a whole only with passable mediocrity, we need 
but refer to those who, by their development of the idea of the 
destiny of man, have given us so little help towards drawing 
us out of the sorry mean between those views which, as it 
appears, have to be reconciled with each other. Tor in looking 
up to the height of our destiny, the individuality and the mani- 
fold earthly interests are generally forgotten, until we come to 
forget them altogether—and while morality is rocked to sleep 
in the belief in transcendental powers, the true powers and 
means which rule the world are at the disposal of the unbe- 
liever. 
To repair all at once what is wanting in the preparatory work 
is a problem which we dare not think of here! -Suflice it if we
-P-A-G-E-136

  are but successful in bringing the points in question more 
distinctly into view. Naturally, our chief business is to distin- 
guish most carefully between the different chief concepts, #.e. 
many-sidedness, interest, character, morality—for on them must 
be directed all the labour which we propose to expend. During 
the analysis, the relationships of each to the others will per- 
haps adjust themselves. As to individuality however, it is 
evidently a psychological phenomenon; the examination of it 
therefore would belong to the second part of pedagogy already 
mentioned, which would have to be built on theoretical, while 
the present must be based on practical, conceptions. We can- 
not, however, here put individuality entirely on one side, or we 
should be constantly disturbed by the remembrance of it, and 
hindered from confidently concentrating our minds on the work 
of thinking out the main lines of the aim of education. Some 
steps therefore must here be taken to adjust individuality to 
character and many-sidedness; then the axioms and relation- 
ships arrived at can be mentally carried forward to the follow- 
ing books, and further progress made in bringing the objects 
of education into view from all sides, without losing the one in 
the other. Mere doctrines, however, can never take the place 
of personal practice. 
V. 
Individuality and Character. 
Each thing is differentiated, by its individuality, from others 
of the same species. The distinguishing characteristics are 
often called individual character, and thus in common language 
the two words, which we wish to define as opposites, are con- 
founded with each other. But as soon as characters in a play, 
or the want of character in children, are spoken of, we imme- 
diately feel the word character is used in different senses. Mere 
individualities make a bad drama, and children have very 
marked individualities without possessing character. Children 
are wanting in that which dramatis persone must possess, what 
above all goes to make up character in men as reasoning beings 
—that is WILL, and we mean will in the strict sense, which is far 
different from variations of temper or desire, for these are not
-P-A-G-E-137
  The Aim of Education generally. 117 
  determined, while the will on the contrary is. The kind of the 
determination constitutes the character. 
Willing—determination—takes place in consciousness. Indi- 
viduality, on the other hand, is unconscious. It is the myste- 
rious root to which our psychological heredity (psychologische 
Ahndung) refers everything which, according to circumstances, 
comes out ever differently in human beings. The psychologist 
ultimately attributes character also to individuality, while the 
teacher of transcendental freedom, who has eyes only for the 
expressions of the already formed character, separates the in- 
telligible from nature by an impassable gulf. ! 
Character then, almost inevitably expresses itself in opposi- 
tion to individuality by conflict. For itis simple and stead- 
fast ; individuality, on the contrary, continually sends forth 
from its depths other and new thoughts and desires. Even 
1 The following note, translated from Richter’s edition of Herbart’s works 
(Anmerkung 93), explains the theory of transcendental freedom, to which 
Herbart often alludes, and his reasons for rejecting it. ‘‘ The reference is 
to Fichte’s philosophy, against which Herbart earnestly protested, because 
it accepted the theory of transcendental freedom. This theory was pre- 
viously admitted by Kant, who assumed man has a two-fold character—an 
empirical determined by experience, intercourse, temperament, etc., and 
an intelligible (absolute capacity), which exists as a thing in itself transcen- 
dental, that is outside experience, time, and all chains of causation, and 
thus is not determinable, but determines only, and is at the same time the 
basis of that transcendental freedom. Still more sharply did Fichte de- 
fine the concept. According to his whole teaching, the pure absolute Ego 
postulated that its activity was of endless duration, that it comprehended 
all that was real in itself, and, by means of absolutely unrestrained reflec- 
tion on itself as a natural being, gained unlimited power over itself, and 
thereby acquired the capability of self-determination unconditionally and 
without exception, in conformity with the idea of independence. According 
to this it depends merely on a man’s freedom whether he has placed him- 
self on a higher instead of a lower level for ‘only one resolution is neces- 
sary, and man is raised above all nature; the formation of another 
character if the present has become worthless, merely depends on his 
freedom.” That from such a standpoint, the cultivation of morality—that 
is to say education which strives after this cultivation, would be nega- 
tived is apparent. Fichte perceived this himself and could only return to 
it by roundabout ways. For if morality depends on a free resolution with- 
out any external incentive, we can the less help any one to attain to it by 
external influence, since inward absolute freedom does not permit itself to 
be reached by external means. Herbart, therefore, was perfectly right in 
renouncing this freedom entirely, and in declaring its acceptance to be in- 
consistent with the aim of education.’’
-P-A-G-E-138

118 Science of Education. 
  if its activity be conquered, it still enfeebles the execution of 
resolves through its manifold passivity and susceptibility. 
This struggle is not confined to moral characters; every 
character knows it. For each individual in his own way seeks 
consistency. The ambitious man and the egoist complete them- 
selves in victory over the better traits of individuality. The 
hero of vice and the hero of virtue, alike complete themselves 
in victory over self. In ridiculous contrast, weak individuals 
also exist, who, in order also to have a theory and a con- 
sistency, base their theory on the principle of not fighting but 
letting themselves slide. Truly a wearisome and a wonderful 
struggle out of light into darkness, out of consciousness into 
the unconscious. It is at least better to wage it sensibly than 
in a spirit of blind obstinacy. 
VI. 
Individuality and Many-sidedness. 
If we had previously to separate things which appeared 
merged one m another, we have here to place in due order that 
which admits of arrangement. 
Many-sidedness has neither sex, nor rank, nor age. With men- 
tal feelers everywhere, with ever-ready sensation, it suits men 
and girls, children and women; it is as you will, either courtier 
or citizen, it is at home in Athens and in London, in Paris and 
in Sparta. Aristophanes and Plato are its friends, though 
neither possesses it. Intolerance is in its eyes the only crime. 
It observes the gay, thinks the loftiest, loves the most beau- 
tiful, ridicules the distorted, and exercises itself in each. 
Nothing is new to it; but everything remains fresh. Custom, 
prejudice, aversion, and torpor disturb it not. Awaken Alci- 
biades, lead him through Europe, and you will see the many- 
sided man! In this one man, the only one as far as we know, 
individuality was many-sided. 
In this sense, the man of character is not many-sided, be- 
cause he does not will it. He wills not to be the medium for 
all the sensations which the moment sends, nor the friend of 
all who attach themselves to him, nor the tree whereon the
-P-A-G-E-139
  The Aim of Education generally. 119 
fruits of all moods grow. He scorns to be the centre of con- 
tradictions. Indifference and strife are alike hateful to him. 
He maintains his sincerity and his earnestness. 
Whether the many-sidedness of Alcibiades may or may not 
be reconcilable with individuality is a matter of indifference 
to the teacher, who cannot forego the culture of character. 
Deeper down the conception of many-sidedness as an attribute 
of the person will nevertheless be dissolved in ideas which may 
not harmonize with that picture. 
But to individuality, which at times assumes airs, and makes 
demands,merely because it is individuality,we oppose the picture 
of many-sidedness, with whose demands it can compare its own. 
We concede then that individuality may come into collision 
with many-sidedness; we do not forget that we declared war 
against it in the name of the latter, if it would not allow of 
proportioned many-sided interest. While we however, at once 
rejected dabbling in many things (Vielgeschaftigkeit), a large 
sphere yet remains for individuality in which to exercise its 
activity—to make choice of its vocation, and to acquire the 
thousand little habits and comforts, which so long as no more 
value is attached to them than they are worth, will do but little 
harm to the receptivity and mobility of the mind. The prin- 
ciple has been previously laid down, that the teacher should 
not make attempts which are beside the aim of education. 
There are many individualities ; the idea of many-sidedness 
is but one. The former is contained in the latter collectively as 
the part in the whole. And the part can be measured by the 
whole ; it can also be enlarged to the whole. This has now to 
be accomplished by education. 
But we must not picture this enlargement, as if to the 
already existent part other parts were to be gradually added. 
Many-sidedness in its entirety floats constantly before the 
teacher, but diminished and enlarged. His task is to increase 
the quantity, without changing the outlines, the proportion, the 
form. Only this work undertaken with the individual does 
always change his outline, as if from a certain centre point on 
an irregular angular body a sphere gradually grew, which 
was nevertheless incapable of ever covering over the extreme
-P-A-G-E-140
  120 Science of Education. 
projections. The projections—the strength of individuality 
—may remain, so far as they do not spoil the character ; 
through them the entire outline may take this or that form. 
It will not be difficult after the taste is formed, to unite with 
each of these a certain peculiar fitness. But the solid con- 
tent of an interest equably enlarged on all sides, determines 
the store of the immediate intellectual life, which since it does 
not hang on one thread, cannot be destroyed by one stroke of 
fate, but can merely be diverted by circumstances. And since 
the moral order of life takes its direction from circumstances, 
a many-sided culture gives a priceless facility and pleasure in 
passing on to every new kind of activity and mode of life, that 
may at any time be the best. The more individuality is blended 
with many-sidedness, the more easily will the character assert 
its sway over the individual. 
We have thus united what up to this point admits of union 
in the elements of the aim of education. 
VII. 
Preliminary Glance at the Measures of Education proper. 
Interest arises from interesting objects and occupations. 
Many-sided interest originates in the wealth of these. To create 
and develop this interest is the task of instruction, which 
carries on and completes the preparation begun by intercourse 
and experience. 
In order that character may take a moral direction, indi- 
viduality must be held dipped, as it were, in a fluid element, 
which according to circumstances either resists or favours it, | 
but for the most part is hardly perceptible to it. This element 
is discipline, which is mainly operative on the arbitrary will © 
(Willkiir), but also partially on the judgment. 
Much has already been said about discipline, when speaking 
of government and of instruction in the Introduction. If it is 
not apparent therefrom why the first place is assigned to instruc- 
tion, and the second to discipline in thinking out educational 
measures systematically, we can only again call attention to 
the religion between many-sided interest and moral character 
 
-P-A-G-E-141
The Aim of Education generally. I2I 
in the course of this treatise. If morality has no root in many- 
sidedness, then certainly discipline may be properly considered 
independently of instruction ; the teacher must then directly so 
grasp, so charm and so constrain the individual, that the good 
rises with strength, and the evil sinks and gives way. Teachers, 
however, must ask themselves whether a mere discipline, so 
abstract and compulsory, has been recognized as possible till 
now? If not, they have every reason to suppose that the indi- 
viduality must first be changed through widened interest, and 
approximate to a general form, before they can venture to think 
they will find it amenable to the general obligatory moral law. 
In dealing with previously neglected subjects, the teacher 
will have to measure that which admits of treatment, besides 
taking into account the individuality before him, chiefly by the 
subject’s receptibility and fitness for a new and better circle of 
thought. If the estimate of this receptibility and fitness be 
unfavourable, it is clear that education proper must be super- 
seded by a watchful and trustworthy government, which will 
have to be undertaken by the State or some other influential 
body.

  SECOND BOOK. 
MANY-SIDEDNESS OF INTEREST. 
CHAPTER I. 
THE IDEA OF MANY-SIDEDNESS. 
PeRHAPS in common parlance the word many-sidedness has not 
been defined with sufficient clearness, hence a suspicion might 
easily arise, that a vague, variable idea had taken shelter behind 
it, which if properly determined would require another term. 
Some think to improve the expression by suggesting all-sided- 
ness. In effect, how many sides has many-sidedness? If it be 
a whole, and as such I considered it when contrasting it with 
individuality, then all the parts will belong to the whole, and 
there will be no need to speak of a mere number of parts, as if 
it were the great number that amazed us. 
We can possibly hereafter enumerate exhaustively all the 
chief sides of many-sidedness. If, however, the separate parts 
do not immediately appear as making up one main concept, 
and indeed as existing only to that end—if we calculate upon 
finding them not together, but scattered singly and in infinite 
combinations in the mind—and finally, seeing that we origin- 
ally included the manifold acts of volition in our educational 
aim only as wealth of the inner life without fixing their num- 
ber (Book i. Ch. 2, Sect. iii.)—under all these conditions then 
many-sidedness is the most expressive term possible, inasmuch 
as it indicates to us we must count to the aggregate, any one of 
these many parts as necessarily implying the remainder. 
Although however, the various directions into which interest 
branches out, are as numerous as the manifold forms and colours 
in which its objects appear before us, yet all ought to start 
from one point; or rather the many sides should represent sides 
of the same person, like different surfaces of one body. All the 
122 
 
-P-A-G-E-143
  Many-Sidedness of Interest. 123 
  interests of a single consciousness must find their place in that 
person; we must never lose this unity. 
It is obvious we have differentiated here the subjective and 
the objective of many-sidedness. As we wish first to develop 
the mere formal concept without reference to the materials of 
many-sided culture, we have no further distinctions to make in 
the objective. The subjective, on the contrary, supplies matter 
for thought. Shall we, to avoid one-sidedness, plunge into 
frivolity ? The frivolous man is a new person every moment, 
or at any rate differently coloured, for he himself is properly 
nothing at all. He who gives himself up to impressions and 
fancies has never possessed himself or his surroundings; the 
many sides are not there, for the personality of whom they 
must be sides does not exist. 
We are now prepared for the development. 
Z. 
Concentration (Vertiefung) and Reflection (Besinnung).* 
He who has at any time given himself up con amore to any 
object of human activity understands what concentration means. 
For what occupation, or what kind of knowledge, is so mean, 
what gain on the road of culture allows itself to be so quickly 
  1 Herbart, in the Altesten Heften, gives another exposition of the concept 
of many-sidedness, which was probably intended for the Allgemeine Péda- 
gogik, but was afterwards exchanged for that given in the text. In the 
same place he thus explains the terms ‘“‘ Vertiefung” and “ Besinnung”’ : 
“* Vertiefung’ occurs when a thought or series of thoughts becomes so 
powerful within us, that it supplants those presentations which usually 
accompany our consciousness. ‘ Besinnung’ occurs when the ordinary 
contents of our consciousness come forth. The expression ‘ ordinary con- 
sciousness ’ is obviously vague, but this indicates that both ‘ Vertiefung’ and 
‘ Besinnung’ are very partial, and therefore may be very multiform. ‘ Vertief- 
ung’ does not always subdue all the contents of consciousness, nor does 
‘Besinnung’ re-establish them.” It is impossible to find exact English 
equivalents for these terms. In the absence of such, we have adopted for 
** Vertiefung,’’ Concentration, and for ‘‘ Besinnung,” Reflection, and shall use 
them whenever the words occur in this work as expressing Herbart’s mean- 
ing—i.e. ‘‘ Vertiefung’’=an act of thought concentrated upon any subject or 
object to the exclusion of all others, and “‘ Besinnung’”’=an act of recollecting 
and co-ordinating reflection on any of the contents of consciousness.
-P-A-G-E-144
  124 Science of Education. 
won, that there is no need to bury ourselves therein, and with- 
draw awhile from all other thoughts. As a suitable light is 
necessary to every picture, as judges of art require a fitting 
frame of mind in the observer of every work of art—in like 
manner a suitable attention is due to everything worthy of 
being observed, thought, or felt, in order to understand it 
wholly and correctly, and to transport oneself into it. 
The individual grasps rightly what is natural to him,! but the 
more he exclusively cultivates himself in this direction the more 
certainly does he falsify through his habitual frame of mind 
every other impression. This the many-sided man should not 
do. From him many acts of concentration are expected. He 
must grasp everything with clean hands; he must give himself 
wholly up to each one. For all sorts of confused markings are 
not to be scratched upon him; the mind must go out clearly 
in many directions. 
The question arises—How, in doing this, can the personality 
be preserved ? 
Personality rests on the unity of consciousness, on co-ordin- 
ation, on Reflection (Besinnung). The acts of concentration 
exclude each other, and thus even exclude the Reflection in 
which they must be united. These processes cannot be con- 
temporaneous ; they must therefore follow one upon the other ; 
we get first one act of concentration, then another, then their 
meeting in reflection. How many numberless transitions of 
this kind must the mind make before a person, in the possession 
of a rich reflection and the completest power of reverting at 
will into every concentration, can call himself many-sided. 
But many-sidedness depends also on the result the acts of 
concentration will give when they meet together. By no 
means pure reflection, and consequently no true many-sided- 
ness, in so far as they bring together contradictories. They 
then either do not combine, but remain lying near each other, 
in which case the man is scatterbrained, or they grind each 
other down and torment the mind by doubts and impossible 
1 Te. what is peculiarly his bent,

wishes, until kindly nature herself must see if she cannot con- 
quer the disease. 
Even if they contain no contradictions (such as modern fashion 
provides in no small measure), it makes a great difference how, 
and how perfectly they penetrate each other. The more per- 
fectly they become one, the more does the person profit. When 
the blending is imperfect, the many-sided individual becomes 
what is sometimes called “a scholar” in a bad sense, just as a 
whimsical virtuoso is developed out of a single kind of concen- 
tration accompanied by careless reflection. 
We must not do more here in the name of many-sidedness 
than show generally the necessity of reflection. To know be- 
forehand in what manner it is composed on every occasion of 
such and such concentrations would be the business of psycho- 
logy ; to feel it by anticipation is the essence of educational 
tact, the most precious treasure of the art of education. 
In regard to this we may here observe, that between the ex- 
tremes of perfect concentration and exhaustive reflection, lie 
the ordinary states of consciousness, which may be considered 
as we please—on the one side as partial concentrations, on the 
other as partial reflections. As then, perfect many-sidedness 
is unattainable, and since we must be content with some kind 
of, possibly rich, but yet only partial reflection instead of the 
most comprehensive, we might ask, what outline shall be given 
to it, or what part shall be preferably selected out of the whole— 
if the answer did not lie ready before us. It is the individuality, 
and the horizon of the individual determined by his opportuni- 
ties, that cause the first acts of concentration, and therefore 
determine if not the central point, at least the starting-point 
of advancing culture. T’o these we certainly need not pay 
anxious respect, but yet ought not to neglect them so much 
that the gifts of education and the gifts of circumstances cannot 
easily flow into one current. Instruction gladly begins by start- 
ing from what is nearest. But we need have no fear, if that from 
which instruction starts is separated from us by great distances 
of space and time. Thought travels quickly, and only that lies 
far removed from reflection, which is separated by many inter- 
mediate concepts or by many modifications of thought.

Olearness. Association.

The mind is always in motion. At times the movement is 
very rapid; at others, scarcely perceptible. Presentations 
existent at the same time in'whole groups, change perhaps but 
slightly for a time; the remainder are stationary, and, so far 
as they are concerned, the mind is quiescent. The mode of 
progression itself is shrouded in mystery. Nevertheless these 
preliminary considerations provide us with a basis for division, 
of which we shall frequently stand in need, to bring down the 
concepts whose extension is too wide into the sphere of the 
practical. 
1 The concentrations ought to change; they ought to merge 
in each other, and in reflection, reflection again in new con- 
centrations. But each in itself is quiescent. 
Quiescent concentration, if it be but clear and pure, sees 
single things distinctly. For it is only clear when everything 
is kept at a distance that makes the act of presentment a turbid 
mixture, or when several varied concentrations disintegrated 
by the teacher’s care are presented one by one. 
The presentations are associated by the progress of one Con- 
centration into another. In the midst of the crowd of associ- 
ations hovers imagination; it tastes every mixture and despises 
nothing but the tasteless. But the entire mass is tasteless as 
soon as the elements can commingle one with another, and that 
is possible only, if the clear antithesis of single things does not 
prevent it. 
1 Herbart repeatedly returns in his psychological works to these concepts 
—Concentration and Refiection—as if to emphasize at once their import- 
ance and their difficulty. In his Lehrbuch der Psychologie, Par. 210, Werke 
5, 8. 146 he says: ‘“‘ Vertiefung’ and ‘ Besinnung,’ as forming the act of 
mental respiration, ought always to alternate with each other. ‘ Vertiefung’ 
takes place when presentations are successively brought into consciousness 
in sufficient strength and purity, as far as possible, without obstructions. 
‘Besinnung’ is the collecting and binding together of these presentations. 
The more perfectly and purely these operations are performed, the greater 
will be the success of instruction. In the Hssay on an Obscure Side of 
Pedagogy, Werke 7, 8. 69, ‘ Besinnung’ is described as the mingling of the 
comprehensions previously existent apart in consciousness. 
 
-P-A-G-E-147
    Many-Sidedness of Interest. 127 
Quiescent reflection sees the relationship of the many; it 
sees each particular thing as a member of the relationship in 
its right place. The perfect order of a copious reflection is 
called System. But there can be no system, no order, no 
relationship without clearness in single things. For relation- 
ship does not lie in mixture, it exists only amid separated and 
re-united parts. 
The progress of reflection is Method. It runs through sys- 
tem, produces new members of it, and watches over the result 
in its application. Many use the word who know nothing of 
the thing. The difficult business of cultivating the mind ac- 
cording to method must be on the whole left to the teacher ; 
if the present book does not show how indispensable it is to 
order methodically one’s personal thoughts on education, it 
will have availed nothing with the reader. 
Experience continuously accumulates confused masses in the 
mind of the child. Much of it is again gradually analysed as 
objects come and go before the mind, and there remains a bene- 
ficial facility of association for that which has been analysed. 
Much however awaits the teacher, who finds an especially 
long task with those who have spent many years without intel- 
lectual help. The mental condition in such pupils is very inert 
towards everything which ought to stimulate them to change. 
Man sees nothing but the old in the new, so long as each simi- 
larity only brings out by reminiscence the whole and the same 
mass. 
Faulty association is most often to be found in knowledge 
acquired at school. For either there was not sufficient force 
in the matter learned to impel it forwards to the sphere of the 
imagination, or the learning checked even the course of the 
imagination day by day, and the mind stiffened in every part. 
No one expects system either from experience, or in common 
fairness, from such sciences as till now had, more correctly 
speaking, some sort of an arrangement than a system of their 
own. But even if the exposition of a science be systematically 
correct, the learner yet gains at first only a series which he must 
for a long time revolve in association before the combining 
reflection makes him feel the superiority of the selected series.
-P-A-G-E-148
  128 Science of Education. 
How much less hope there is that the proposed system will 
meet with correct application.1 Method is to most people a 
-learned name; their thinking hovers unsteadily between 
abstraction and determination, and follows what charms, in- 
stead of the relationships of things. Similarities they associate 
as identities, and in their doggerel, “idea” rhymes with 
“thing,” 
CHAPTER II. 
CONCEPT OF INTEREST. 
WE contracted the scope of the manifold personal life from the 
dabbling in many things, to manifold interest, so that the con- 
centrations might never stray too far from the uniting reflection. 
For just because the power of human concentration is too weak 
to accomplish much by rapid transitions in many directions (we 
measure it here by the standard of the totality of human 
activity, in comparison with which the most active are as 
nothing), we must therefore keep at a distance those irregular 
employments, which would create something, now here, now 
there, but which, instead of being useful to society, destroy the 
individual pleasure in work by imperfect results, and obscure 
the personality by distraction. 
The concept of interest then took its origin for us in that 
we broke off, as it were, something from the growths of human 
  1 Herbart gives an example of the application of the four concepts treated 
of in this chapter—Clearness, Association, System, Method—to definite 
matter of instruction, in the Kurzen Encyclopedia, Werke 3, 8. 224. 
‘* Should any one desire to teach Philosophy by the guidance of this series 
of concepts, he must first separate from each other the objects of philoso- 
phic contemplation, and examine them as far as possible singly, for Clear- 
ness requires the absence of everything through which one object can ob- 
scure the rest. Then he must combine them thoroughly to bring them into 
manifold incidental connections, till his listeners have full power of passing 
from one point to another without difficulty, and especially till they are 
sure of no longer losing sight of one object more than of others (Association). 
Not till then will the systematic exposition begin, and not till then will its 
value be perceived as the arrangement and determination of the mutable 
(System). The value of that arrangement and settlement will not be fully 
proved, till finally Method is added, which shows with regard to every part 
of System the necessity of its position.

  activity, in that we in no wise denied to inner vitality its mani- 
fold developments, but certainly denied their extreme expression. 
What is it that is broken off, or that is denied? It is action, 
and that which immediately impels thereto, desire. Desire 
therefore, taken together with interest, must represent the 
whole of an upspringing human emotion. Further, there could 
be no intention of closing to all emotions an outlet in external 
activity ; on the contrary, after we have first distinguished the 
various emotions by their objects, it will become clear which 
kind is worthy of a certain development even to its fullest 
expression. 
I. 
Interest and Desire. 
Interest, which in common with desire, will, and the 
esthetic judgment,! stands opposed to indifference, is dis- 
tinguished from those three, in that it neither controls nor 
disposes of its object, but depends upon it. It is true that we 
are inwardly active because we are interested, but externally 
we are passive till interest passes into desire or volition. It 
occupies the mean between mere observation and attainment. 
This remark helps to make clear a distinction, which must 
not be overlooked, viz. that the object of interest can never be 
identical with that which is in reality desired. For the desires, 
while they would fain grasp, strive toward some future object 
which they do not already possess; interest, on the other hand, 
unfolds itself in observation, and clings to the contemplated 
present. Interest only rises above mere perception in that what 
it perceives possesses the mind by preference, and makes itself 
felt among the remaining perceptions by virtue of a certain 
1 Herbart, as has been explained in the translator’s Introduction (page 26), 
applies the term to those judgments which are based on the moral intuition, 
and supply the ground for elective obedience to the moral law. His idea of 
the original unconditioned nature of these judgments in his wider field of 
esthetics which includes morality, is thus expressed by an English writer in 
the sphere of morality: ‘as the instinctive impulses turn up within us one 
after the other, and two or more come into presence of each other, they 
report to us their relative worth, and we intuitively know the better from 
the worse.’’—(Dr. Martineau, The Seat of Authority in Religion.) 
K

causality. From the preceding is immediately deduced what 
follows.! 
Il. 
(Merken) Observation. Expectation (Erwarten). 
(Fordern) Demand Action (Handeln). 
The first causality which a presentation more prominent than 
others exercises over the rest is that it involuntarily represses and 
obscures them. As it then exercises its power to bring about 
what we have above termed concentration, we can designate the 
condition of the mind so occupied by the word Observation. 
The easiest and commonest course of this causality, which 
seldom permits the attainment of a quiescent concentration, 
consists in the arousing of a cognate presentation by the object 
observed. If the mind be merely inwardly active, and permits 
this movement to complete itself, then at most a new observa- 
tion follows. But often the newly aroused presentation cannot 
immediately come forth, and this is always the case (to say 
nothing of the obscure efforts of presentiment and the spirit of 
enquiry) when interest started from the observation of an 
external reality, and when to this a fresh presentation attaches 
1 Note on the passing of Interest into Desire and Volition.—In accordance 
with Herbart’s psychology explained in the translators’ introduction, both 
feeling and desire are states of the presentations. When some presenta- 
tions strive to retain any given presentation in consciousness and others strive 
to expel it, a feeling of discomfort or pain arises, which may pass into desire, 
provided the power of those which retain is greater than those which would 
expel. Desires are ordinarily excited by recollection of the object; they 
change with a painful feeling of renunciation, when the expelling presenta- 
tions (obstacles which stand in the way of attainment) preponderate. A 
feeling of pleasure arises when a presentation receives such help from others, 
that it is raised higher in consciousness than it would be by its unaided 
strength. The essence of a desire is that presentations existent in conscious- 
ness work their way upwards against opposing presentations. Since on 
account of this opposition they can move but slowly, other presentations 
bound to them in series win time also to rise in consciousness, and thereby 
to enter into many new combinations amongst each other. In this way the 
obstacles to desires are an important element in the cultivation of the 
circle of thought and indeed as a means thereto, the ‘the many-sided 
balanced interest of the Pédagogik is in the Darstellung exchanged for the 
awakening of manifold desires.”” When desire often succeeds, it becomes 
united with expectation, and finally with certainty of attainment; it has 
then formed itself into will. 
 
-P-A-G-E-151
  Many-Sidedness of Interest. 131 
itself as if the reality moved or changed in a certain manner. 
So long as the reality delays presenting this progress to the 
senses, interest hovers in Expectation. 
The expected is naturally not identical with that which 
aroused the expectation. The former, which perhaps can now 
for the first time put in an appearance, is in the future; the 
latter, on or from which the new can arise or date itself, is the 
present on which, in the case of interest, attention properly speak- 
ing fastens. If the condition of mind changes to such an extent 
that the mind loses itself more in the future than in the 
present, and the patience which lies in expectation is exhausted, 
then out of interest grows desire, and this makes itself known 
through the Demand of its object. 
Demand however, when the faculties are at its service, comes 
forth as Action. 
It is inglorious to be absorbed by desires, and yet more 
inglorious to be absorbed by a multiplicity of desires, and if we 
wished to correct the many-sidedness of desire by dissolving the 
concentrations into a reflection, even then we should at most 
gain a system of desire thereby, a plan of egoism, but nothing 
which could be united with temperance and morality. Patient 
interest, on the contrary, can never become too rich, and the 
richest interest will be the most ready to remain patient. In 
it the character possesses a facility in accomplishing its resolves, 
which accompanies it everywhere, without frustrating its plans 
by pretentiousness. 
However much action may be peculiarly the prerogative of 
character, there is yet another species of activity which is 
specially adapted to children who are naturally still without 
character, viz. experiment. This arises not so much out of 
desire as out of expectation; the result to the character in 
whatever way it turns out is equally remarkable; it always 
helps imagination forward and enriches interest. 
 
-P-A-G-E-152
  132 Science of Education. 
  CHAPTER III. 
OBJECTS OF MANY-SIDED INTEREST. 
Tue formal concepts hitherto treated of would be empty, if 
what they presupposed were non-existent. It is the interesting 
which the concentrations ought to pursue, and the reflections 
collect. Clearness and connection, system and method belong to 
that which is observed and expected. 
We have now to take our way through the sphere of the 
interesting. But shall we undertake to enumerate the sum of 
interesting things? Shall we lose ourselves in the objects, in 
order not to omit any subject worthy of knowledge in the cata- 
logue of useful lessons? Here our sight is obscured by the 
sultry atmosphere of perplexity, in which the ardour is so often 
stifled of those pupils and teachers, who think the attainment 
of many-sided culture impossible, unless they accumulate much 
apparatus, and undertake as many tasks as the day has hours. 
Immoderate ones! Heaven endows every kind of interest 
with thousands of opportunities; they pursue all these and 
attain nothing but weariness. 
A slight error of opinion must here be corrected. Do not 
forget interest among interesting things; classify not objects, 
but conditions of mind. 
a 
Knowledge and Sympathy. 
Knowledge’ imitates what lies before it in Idea. Sympathy 
transports itself into the feeling of another. 
In knowledge there is an antithesis between the thing and the 
idea. Sympathy, on the contrary, multiplies the same feeling. 
1 A clear explanation of the process of knowledge and of the antithesis 
between the Thing and the Idea is given in a ‘‘ Study of Spinoza,” by 
Dr. Martineau, p. 108. ‘‘ In all knowledge there is an idea of the cognised 
object presenting within us; that which is not within us. This Idea is 
other than the object, and indeed is antithetic to it, planted as it is in the 
opposite sphere. . . . Yet this Idea, though other than the object, agrees 
with the object so as to report what it is, i.e. to take its essence into one 
thought. The Idea of an ellipse is different from the ellipse, having no area 
and foci; yet presents in thought the characteristic properties which the 
figure possesses in fact. 
 
-P-A-G-E-153
    Many-Sidedness of Interest. 133 
The objects of knowledge are wont to be at rest, and the 
mind goes from one to the other. Feelings are wont to be in 
movement, and the mind in touch with them accompanies 
their course. 
The circle of objects for knowledge embraces nature and 
humanity. Only certain expressions of humanity belong to 
sympathy. 
Can knowledge ever end? It is always at its beginning. 
Receptivity is as becoming in the man as in the boy. 
Can sympathy ever be too active? LEgoism is always near 
enough ; its power can never meet with too strong a counter- 
poise. But without reason, without theoretical culture, a weak 
sympathy falls into one folly after another. 
II. 
The Parts of Knowledge and Sympathy. 
Here the idea of the many, which belongs to manysidedness, 
falls apart. As we have only to deal with manysidedness, we 
do not trouble ourselves about the principles of division, but 
merely about the distinct contrast of the parts. Let any one 
see whether more of them are to be found than the following :— 
Knowledge Sympathy 
Of the manifold, with humanity, 
Of its law, with society, 
Of its wsthetic relations. and the relation of both 
to the Highest Being. 
(1) Specific distinction among the parts of knowledge. 
However rich and vast nature may be, still so long as the 
mind receives it as it presents itself, it will only be more and 
more filled with the actual. The manifold in the mind is 
merely that of phenomena, just as the unity in it is merely that 
of their similarity and inter-connection. The mind’s interest! 
depends on the strength, variety, novelty, and varied succession 
of these phenomena. 
But in that which is according to law, necessity is discerned 
or at least assumed ; the impossibility of the contrary is either

  seen or taken for granted ; a datwm is analysed into matter and 
form, and the form is re-formed by way of experiment. Only 
in this way can the connection appear first as given, and tlien 
further as necessary. Interest! depends on concepts, on their 
opposition and interconnection, on their mode of comprehend- 
ing various aspects, without becoming confused with these. 
Taste does not supply a contrary but an addition to con- 
templative observation (Anschauung). Its judgment always 
follows—suppressed or expressed—upon every completed act 
of presentation provided that this latter has not at once 
vanished in change. It does not lie in mere perception ;— 
approval, disapproval, are verdicts on the object, not an im- 
mersion init. Interest? attaches itself to the idea, not to the 
thing,—to relationships, not to number or mass. 
(2) Specific distinctions among the parts of sympathy.® 
If sympathy simply accepts the affections it finds in human 
minds, follows their course, enters into their varieties, colli- 
sions, and contradictions, it is merely a fellow feeling. Such 
would be the sympathy of the poet, if he were not as artist 
the creator and master of his materials. 
But it can also abstract the varied affections of many men 
from the individuals, it can seek to reconcile their contra- 
dictions, it can interest itself in the welfare of the whole, and 
1 That is, interest in the law of the manifold. 
2 That is, interest in the esthetic relationships. 
8 As a further explication of Interest excited by the parts of knowledge, 
that is interest in the Objective, and of interest excited by the parts of 
Sympathy, that is interest in the subjective, Herbart gives the following in 
his Kleinere Schriften :— 
“ The first kind of interest—that in the objective—is felt partly in the 
comprehension of objects, partly in the grasping of their interdependence 
according to law, partly in the approval which their harmony and adapta- 
bility to an end win from us. 
“The second kind of interest—in the subjective—devotes itself partly to 
men as individual beings, partly to society, and partly to the relation of 
nature to humanity. In all these aspects the characteristic of this second 
kind of interest Jies in the sympathy, in the concentration on human feel- 
ings (whether personal or those of others). Quite foreign to this, on the 
contrary, is all mere observation, however interesting, of human beings; 
this belongs to the first kind—the objective. Both kinds touch at their 
highest point and meet together in Religion, for its object is Providence. 
 
-P-A-G-E-155
  Many-Sidedness of Interest. 135 
then again distribute this interest in thought amongst the 
individuals. This is social sympathy. It disposes of the par- 
ticular, that it may attach itself to the general. It requires 
exchange and sacrifice, opposes actual emotions, and imagines 
possible better ones in their place. This is the attitude of the 
politician. 
Finally, it can pass over from mere sympathy into fear and 
hope for these emotions by contemplating the state of men in 
relation to their environment. This solicitude, against which 
all skill and activity in the end appear weak, leads to a religious 
need, to a moral as well as to a eudzemonistic need. Belief 
springs out of need.} 
If we wish to avoid exaggeration and difficulty in our pro- 
gress, an explanatory parallel may be here permissible. Both 
knowledge and sympathy originally take what they find, as 
it is; the one seems immersed in empiricism, the other in com- 
passion. But both work their way upward, impelled by the 
nature of things. The riddle of the world extorts speculation 
from empiricism, the conflicting claims of humanity extort the 
social spirit of order out of sympathy. The spirit of order 
gives laws, speculation recognizes laws. Meanwhile, the mind 
having freed itself from the burden of the mass of particulars, 
and being no longer sunk in single things, is now attracted by 
relationships; quiescent contemplation is attracted by the 
esthetic relationships, fellow-feeling by the relationship of 
the desires and powers of humanity in their subordination to 
the course of things. Thus the former rises to taste, the latter 
to religion. 
  CHAPTER IV. 
INSTRUCTION. 
To leave man to Nature, or even to wish to lead him to, and 
train him up in, Nature is mere folly. For what is the nature 
of man? To the Stoics and Epicureans, it was alike the 
convenient peg on which they hung their systems. Human 
1 J.e. a need which concerns itself with morality as well as with happiness.
-P-A-G-E-156
  136 Science of Education. 
nature, which appears to be suited for the most diverse con- 
ditions, is of so general a character that its special determina- 
tion and development is entirely left to the race. The ship 
constructed and arranged with highest art, that it may be able 
to adapt itself to every change of wind and wave, only awaits 
the steersman to direct it to its goal, and guide its voyages 
according to circumstances. 
We know our aim. Nature does much to aid us, and 
humanity has gathered much on the road she has already 
traversed ; it is our task to join them together. 
I. 
Instruction as the Complement of Experience and Intercourse. 
From Nature man attains to knowledge through experience, 
and to sympathy through intercourse. Experience, though 
our teacher through the whole of life, supplies nevertheless 
but an infinitesimal fragment of a vast whole; infinite time 
and space veil for us an infinitely greater possible experience. 
Perhaps intercourse is relatively less barren, for the feelings of 
our acquaintances are as a whole like those of the rest of 
humanity ; but sympathy rests on the finest distinctions, and 
one-sidedness of sympathy is much worse than one-sidedness of 
knowledge. Therefore the gaps left by intercourse in the little 
sphere of feeling, and those left by experience in the larger 
circle of knowledge, are for us almost equally great, and in the 
former as in the latter, completion by instruction must be 
equally welcome. 
But it is no light task to make good such important de- 
ficiencies, and before we burden instruction with it, we must 
indeed consider of what it is, and is not, capable. Instruction 
spins a long, fine, flexible thread, which the striking of the 
clock severs, and again joins, which binds at every moment 
the pupil’s own mental activity, and, whilst it unwinds itself 
according to its own measure of time, confuses his tempo, does 
not follow its leaps, nor allow time for its pauses. How 
different it is with contemplative observation (Anschauung). 
It at once spreads out a surface broad and wide; the eye,
-P-A-G-E-157
    Many-Sidedness of Interest. 137 
recovered from its first astonishment, separates, unites, moves 
hither and thither, rests, renews its glance. To all this the 
sense of touch and the other senses are also added, thoughts 
gather, experiments are begun from which new forms arise 
and new thoughts awake; everywhere there is free and full 
ife, everywhere enjoyment of the abundance that is offered. 
This abundance, this offering without exaction or compulsion 
—how can instruction attain to it? How far can it vie with 
intercourse, which is constantly claiming the expression of its 
own power—intercourse which, as a thoroughly mobile and 
plastic element, gives itself up with a susceptibility as great 
as the activity and power, with which it enters into the depths 
of the mind to remould and mingle therein all kinds of feel- 
ings P—intercourse which not only enriches sympathy with the 
feelings of others, but also multiplies one’s own feeling in the 
hearts of others, that it may be returned to us strengthened and 
purified? If the latter advantage be peculiar to personal con- 
tact, and on the other hand is decidedly weaker in intercourse 
by writing, it must be finally lost in the mere representation of 
the strange feelings of unknown persons from distant countries 
and times, by which alone instruction is able to enlarge the 
circle of intercourse. 
Indeed, who can dispense with experience and intercourse in 
education ? To do so would be to dispense with daylight and 
content ourselves with candlelight! Fulness, strength, indi- 
vidual definiteness in all our presentations, practice in the 
application of the general, contact with the real, with the 
country and the age, patience with men as they are—all 
this must be derived from those original sources of mental life. 
But, alas! education has not experience and intercourse in 
its power. Compare the farmyard on the estate of an in- 
dustrious farmer with the rooms in the palace of a fashionable 
lady who lives in town. In the former, the pupil can be taken 
everywhere ; in the latter, he must be kept back everywhere. 
Let him be what he may—peasants, shepherds, hunters, workers 
of every kind, and their sons, will be for him in his earliest 
years the best society; wherever they take him he will learn 
and gain from them. On the contrary, amongst the children
-P-A-G-E-158
  138 Science of Education. 
of aristocratic families in town, amongst the servants in town, 
how much there is that is dangerous ! 
All this admits of much closer limitation—it admits of ex- 
ceptions. But finally, if we again remember our aim—many- 
sidedness of interest—it easily occurs to us how limited are 
the opportunities which circumstances afford, and how far 
beyond them the really cultivated mind travels. Besides, the 
most advantageous environment is so limited, that we could 
not by any means take the responsibility of confining the 
culture of a young man within it, if not compelled by necessity. 
If he has leisure and a teacher, nothing exempts the latter 
from the duty of enlarging his pupil’s mental scope by descrip- 
tion, from taking from time the light of the past, and reveal- 
ing the ideas of the immaterial world. 
And ought we to conceal from ourselves, how often the 
distant space is more exquisitely illuminated in descriptions 
and drawings than the present; how much more satisfying 
and elevating is intercourse with the ancients than with con- 
temporaries; how much richer in insight is idea than observa- 
tion, and indeed how indispensable to action is the contrast 
between the actual and what ought to be ? 
Experience and intercourse are often wearisome, and we 
must sometimes bear it. But the pupil must never be con- 
demned to suffer this from the teacher. To be wearisome is 
the cardinal sin of instruction; it is the privilege of instruc- 
tion to fly over steppes and morasses, and if it cannot always 
wander in pleasant valleys, it can train on the other hand in 
mountain climbing and reward with the wider prospect. 
Experience seems, as it were, to expect that instruction will 
follow her, to analyse the masses which she has heaped together ; 
to arrange and connect her dispersed and formless fragments. 
For what does the mind of an uninstructed man look like P 
There is no settled top or bottom, nor even an ordered series ; 
everything is mixed up together. The thoughts have not 
learned to wait. On a given occasion all come forward; so 
many of them become excited by the threads of association, 
and so many come suddenly into consciousness. Thoughts, 
which through frequently repeated impressions have acquired

most power, make themselves felt; they attract what suits 
them and reject what is not agreeable. That which is new 
is wondered at, but left unconsidered, or condemned by a 
judgment based on recollection. There is no rejection of 
what does not belong to them, no emphasis laid upon the 
important point; even if beneficent nature gives a happy hint, 
means are still wanting to pursue the discovered track. This 
is seen when we begin to educate a raw boy between ten and 
fifteen years old. At first attention cannot be brought at all 
to run in an even stream; because no ruling main thought 
preserves order, because subordination is wanting, the mind 
tosses restlessly to and fro, and upon curiosity there follows 
distraction and wanton play. Compare with him the cultivated 
youth, who finds no difficulty at the same age in grasping and 
working out several series of scientific lectures without con- 
fusion. 
Just as unsatisfactory would be the results of mere inter- 
course. To make sympathy the constant spirit of intercourse, 
too much is wanting. Men contemplate, observe, try each 
other; children already use and obstruct each other in their 
play. Even benevolence and love on one side is not at all sure 
of arousing similar feelings on the other. We cannot compel 
love with service. Kindnesses expended without further care, 
generate enjoyment, and enjoyment creates desire for more, 
but no gratitude. This obtains in the intercourse of children 
with each other, and of children with adults. The teacher 
who tries to earn love will himself experience the truth of this. 
Something must be added to the kindnesses which determines 
their intention, the feeling must exhibit itself in such a manner 
that it arouses a similar feeling of the child’s own. This exhi- 
bition falls within the sphere of instruction, yes, even the 
regular school hours, within which no one would systematically

clearness of comprehension, the collision and rebound of presentations

confine the expression of inward feeling, are nevertheless in- 
describably important for preparation for, and predisposition to, 
sympathy, and have to make this their care, no less than 
knowledge. 
The entire life, the whole observation of mankind proves, 
that every one makes out of his experience and intercourse 
something answering to himself—that he here works out the 
ideas and feelings he has brought with him. There are frivolous 
old men, there are unwise worldlings, and on the other hand, 
there are circumspect youths and boys. I have seen both. 
And all my contemporaries must have observed how little the 
greatest historical events can prevail over preconceived ideas. 
The most remarkable experiences lie before us all in common; 
intercourse unites all nations, but differences of opinion and 
disharmony of feeling were hardly ever greater than at the 
present time.} 
The kernel of our mental being, then, cannot be cultivated 
with certain results by means of experience and intercourse. 
Instruction most certainly penetrates deeper into the laboratory 
of the mind. Only think of the power of every religious doctrine! 
Think of the dominating influence which a philosophic lecture 
so easily, nay, almost unawares, exercises over an attentive 
listener. Add thereto the frightful power of novel-reading, 
—for all this belongs to instruction, either bad or good. 
It is true the instruction of to-day is confined to the existing 
(yet not merely the present, but also the past) condition of 
science, art, and literature. Everything depends here on the 
utmost possible utilisation of what is existent, which yet ad- 
mits of being immeasurably perfected. Nevertheless, during 
education we hit upon a thousand desires that go beyond the 
science of education, or rather which make us feel that interest 
in education is nothing separate and apart, and that it can 
1 To understand this, we must understand the spirit of the time—when 
Napoleon’s star was in the ascendant, and his work of general destruction 
in progress—when each man sought a different cause for the universal 
disaster—when science was reviled, enlightenment condemned, and people 
discontented with the present looked back with veneration to the past. 
Even Fichte, in his Characteristics of the Time, called it ‘‘ the age of com- 
pleted sinfulness.”’

least of all thrive in such minds as have been pleased to take 
up the business of education and the companionship of children, 
only because everything else was too lofty or too serious for 
them, and yet they must be first somewhere. 
Interest in education is only an expression of our whole 
interest in the world and in humanity. Instruction concentrates 
all the objects of this interest—where our timid hopes will 
finally be saved—in the bosom of the young, which is the bosom 
of the future. Without this, instruction is of a surety empty 
and meaningless. Let no one say, he educates with his whole 
soul—that is anempty phrase. Hither he has nothing to perfect 
through education (in the boy) or the larger half of his reflection 
belongs to what he imparts to the boy, and makes accessible to 
him, belongs to his expectation of what more carefully culti- 
vated humanity will be able to accomplish, beyond all that our 
race has hitherto experienced. Then, indeed, there flows from 
the full soul a fulness of instruction which can be compared 
with the fulness of experience, then the active mind imparts 
unfettered movement to the listener also, and under the broad 
folds of the mantle of such teaching, there is room enough for 
a thousand subsidiary thoughts without any loss in the clear 
outline of the essential idea. The teacher himself will be to the 
pupil an object of experience, at once as fruitful as it is direct; 
yes, in the hours of teaching an intercourse grows up between 
them which is, at the least, a foretaste of intercourse with the 
great men of antiquity, or with the clearly drawn characters of 
the poet. Absent historic or poetic characters must receive 
life from the life of the teacher. Let him only make a be- 
ginning; the youth, even the boy, will soon contribute from his 
imagination, and the two will often be together in great and 
chosen company, without needing a third. 
Finally, instruction alone can lay claim to cultivate a balanced 
all-embracing many-sidedness. We picture to ourselves a plan 
of instruction divided at first merely according to the parts of 
knowledge and sympathy, leaving entirely out of sight all 
classification of the materials of our knowledge, for these do 
not enter at all into the question of balanced many-sidedness, 
since they do not distinguish between sides of the personality. 
 
-P-A-G-E-162
  142 Science of Education. 
Through comparison with such a plan, we easily see what por- 
tions of it in a fixed subject, and under given conditions, are 
by preference to enjoy the contributions of experience and 
intercourse, and which parts, on the contrary—doubtless much 
greater—are to receive nothing. We find for instance that the 
pupil is more inclined from his environment to social, possibly 
patriotic interests, than to sympathy with individuals—or that 
he is prompted to value matters of taste more than those of 
speculation, or vice versi; in each case the fault is equally 
great. In this there lies a two-fold hint. First, the mass 
on the side of the overweight must be analysed, completed, 
arranged. Secondly, the balance must be restored, partly in 
connection with this, partly directly through instruction. By 
no means, however, should the presence of incidental prominent 
tendencies in the years of cultivation be regarded as a sign 
that they are to be further strengthened by education. This 
practice, which shelters disproportion, is devised by love of 
arbitrariness, and recommended by bad taste. Doubtless the 
lover of the bizarre and of caricature would rejoice to see, 
instead of many fully and proportionately developed men fit to 
move in rank and file, a crowd of humpbacks and cripples of all 
kinds, tumbling wildly over each other. But this is what 
happens where society is composed of men of widely different 
modes of thought; each brags of his own individuality, and no 
one understands his fellows.

Steps in Instruction.

What things must take place consecutively and one through 
the other, and what on the contrary must do so contempo- 
raneously, and each with its proper and original power—are 
questions which touch all employments and all plans in which 
a great number of complicated measures have to be carried out. 
For a beginning is always made at the same time from several 
  
    
1 «« What shall I choose first, what next, what finally.”—Odyssey, ix. 14. 
 
-P-A-G-E-163
  Many-Sidedness of Interest. 143 
  sides, and much always must be prepared by what has gone 
before. These are as it were the two dimensions,! conformably 
to which we have to guide our steps. 
Our preceding concepts show us that instruction has to 
develop knowledge and sympathy at the same time, as diverse 
and fundamentally individual states of mind. If we look at 
the subordinate parts there is clearly a certain succession and 
dependence, but nevertheless no strict sequence. Speculation 
and taste doubtless presuppose the comprehension of the em- 
pirical; but while this comprehension always goes forward, 
they do not perhaps wait for its end. Indeed they rather 
become active betimes, and develop themselves thenceforward 
parallel with the expansion of mere knowledge of the manifold, 
and follow everywhere at its heels if no impediment intervene. 
Kspecially remarkable is speculative activity during the period 
when children perpetually ask—Why? Taste hides itself, per- 
haps more amongst other movements of attention and sympathy, 
yet it always supplies its quota to the preferences and dislikes 
by which children show their distinction of things. And how 
much more rapidly would it develop were we to present to it 
at first the simplest relationships, and not throw it at once into 
incomprehensible complications. Since taste as well as medita- 
tion is something original which cannot be learned, we ought, 
independently of experience, to expect that in the sphere of 
sufficiently known objects, both must become active without 
delay, if the mind be not otherwise distracted or oppressed. It 
is a matter of course, that teachers, to perceive what is moving 
in the children’s minds must, themselves possess that same 
culture, the most subtle traces of which they have to observe in 
them. This is just the misfortune of education, that so many 
feeble lights which glimmer in tender youth, are long since 
1 Herbart further explains his meaning in his Aphorismen zur Piidagogik, 
thus: ‘‘ There is a length and breadth in instruction, formed respectively by 
those subjects which must be learned together, and those which must follow 
each other. The breadth of instruction must be less than its length, which 
is prolonged through several years. But there are only two main threads 
which can and ought to be spun out in both directions—knowledge of nature 
and knowledge of humanity ; languages are but instruments (to acquire this 
knowledge).”
-P-A-G-E-164
  144 Science of Education. 
completely extinguished in adults, who are therefore unfitted 
to kindle those feeble lights into flame. 
The preceding is also true of the parts of sympathy. Among 
a small group of children, if only a little sympathy exists and 
is kept awake, a certain need of social order for the common 
good develops itself spontaneously. And as the most barbarous 
nations are not without divinities, so the souls of children have 
a presentiment of an unseen power, which can exercise influence 
in some way or other in the sphere of their wishes. Whence 
else comes the facility with which various kinds both of super- 
stitious and genuinely religious ideas obtain entrance into, and 
influence with, the little ones? For a child, however, who 
finds itself in close dependence on its parents and guardians, 
these visible persons certainly occupy the place which the 
feeling of dependence assigns to the unseen powers, and just for 
this reason, the earliest religious instruction is only an exceed- 
ingly simple expansion of the relation of the parents to the 
children, as in the same way the first social ideas will be 
taken from the family. 
The varieties of interest then which instruction ought to 
cultivate, present to us only differences in things simultaneous, 
but not a distinct succession of steps. 
On the other hand, the formal fundamental concepts de- 
veloped in the beginning, are based on the antitheses between 
things which follow one upon another. 
Concentration, above all, ought to precede reflection, but at 
what distance? This question remains generally undetermined. 
Both certainly must be kept as near as possible together, for 
we desire no concentrations to the detriment of personal unity, 
which is preserved by means of reflection. Their long and 
unbroken succession would create a tension, incompatible with 
the existence of the healthy mind in the healthy body. In 
order then always to maintain the mind’s coherence, instruction 
must follow the rule of giving equal weight in every smallest 
possible group of its objects to concentration and reflection ; 
that is to say, it must care equally and in regular succession 
for clearness of every particular, for association of the manifold, 
for coherent ordering of what is associated, and for a certain
-P-A-G-E-165
    Many-Sidedness of Interest. 145 
practice in progression through this order. Upon this depends 
the distinctness which must rule in all that is taught. The 
teacher’s greatest difficulty here, perhaps, is to find real par- 
ticulars—to analyse his own thoughts into their elements. Text 
books can in this case partly prepare the ground. 
If however, instruction handles each little group of objects 
in this manner, many groups arise in the mind, and each one 
is grasped by a relative concentration until all are united in a 
higher reflection. But the union of the groups presupposes the 
perfect unity of each group. So long, therefore, as it is still 
possible for the last particular in the content of each group to 
fall apart from the rest, higher reflection cannot be thought of. 
But there is above this higher reflection a still higher, and so 
on indefinitely upwards, to the all-embracing highest, which we 
seek through the system of systems, but never reach. In 
earlier years nothing of this can be attempted; youth is always 
in an intermediate state between concentration and distraction. 
We must be contented in earlier years with not attempting to 
give what we call system in the higher sense, but must on the 
other hand so much the more create clearness in every group; 
we must associate the groups the more sedulously and vari- 
ously, and be careful that the approach to the all-embracing 
reflection is made equally from all sides. 
Upon this depends the articulation of instruction. The larger 
members are composed of smaller, as are the lesser of the least. 
In each of the smallest members, four stages of instruction are 
to be distinguished; it must provide for Clearness, Associa- 
tion, Arrangement, and the Course of this order. These 
grades, which with the smallest members quickly succeed each 
other, follow one another more slowly, when those next in com- 
prehensiveness are formed from the smallest members, and with 
ever-increasing spaces of time, as higher steps of reflection have 
to be climbed. 
If we now look back on the analysis of the concept of in- 
terest, we find therein also, certain steps differentiated—Obser- 
vation, Expectation, Demand and Action. 
Observation depends on the relative power of a presentation 
to that of others which must yield to it—depends therefore 
L
-P-A-G-E-166
  146 Sctence of Education. 
partly on the intrinsic strength of the one, partly on the ease 
with which the remainder yield. The latter leads to the idea 
of a discipline of thought, which we preferred to treat of 
specially in the A B OC of Amnschauung. The strength of a 
presentation can be partly attained through the power of the 
sensuous impression (as, for example, through the simultaneous 
speaking of several children, also by the display of the same 
object in different ways with drawings, instruments, models, 
etc.), partly through the vividness of descriptions, especially 
if already connected presentations rest in the depths of the 
mind, which will unite with the one to be given. To effect this 
union generally, there is need of great skill and thought, which 
aims at anticipating future efforts by giving something to 
prepare the ground for them, as for instance the A B O of 
Anschauung does for mathematics, as the play of combinations 
does for grammar, and as narratives from antiquity do for a 
classical author. 
Through observation the singular becomes distinct, but 
association, order, and progress according to order, must also be 
observed. 
In the same way we get clearness of the expectations and 
association of them ; in fact, systematic and methodical expecta- 
tion. 
Nevertheless these complications do not now claim our chief 
interest. We know that when the expected appears, only a new 
observation is produced. This is generally the case in the sphero 
of knowledge. Where some store of knowledge is already 
accumulated, it is not easy to observe anything to which 
expectations were not attached, yet the expectation dies out or 
becomes satisfied with new knowledge. If vehement desires 
arise therefrom, they would fall under the rule of temperance 
and consequently of discipline. But there is a species of obser- 
vation which is not so easily satisfied or forgotten; there is a 
demand which is intended to be transformed into action; this 
is the demand for sympathy. Whatever rights then temperance 
exercises in this case, that education would nevertheless be a 
failure which did not leave behind resolutions to work for 
the good of humanity and society, as well as a certain energy 
 
-P-A-G-E-167
    Many-Sidedness of Interest. 147 
of the religious postulate. Accordingly, in the cultivation of 
sympathy, the higher steps to which interest may pass come 
much into consideration. And it is quite clear that these steps 
correspond with those of human life. In the child a sympa- 
thising observation is appropriate, in the boy expectation, in the 
youth the demand for sympathy, that the man may act for it. 
The articulation of instruction, however, here permits again, 
even in the smallest subjects which belong to early years, de- 
mand (for sympathy) to be so stimulated that it would pass 
into action. Out of such stimulations there grows in later years, 
assisted at the same time by the formation of character, that 
powerful demand which begets actions. 
Allow me briefly to define the results in few words, which 
can easily be understood. 
Instruction must universally 
point out, 
connect, 
teach, 
philosophise. 
In matters appertaining to sympathy it should be 
observing, 
continuous, 
elevating, 
active in the sphere of reality. 
III. 
Material of Instruction. 
The material of instruction is contained in the sciences. 
Their enumeration will not be expected in a treatise on the 
general science of education. 
Let each enquire of himself how much in his mental store 
belongs to knowledge only, and how much to sympathy, and 
how each of these divisions is apportioned under the above- 
named headings. A self-examination of this kind will gener-

terms of definition (see his edition of Herbart’s works, vol. i. p. 391).

ally reveal a considerable inequality in one’s own culture, and 
lay bare even in its most important parts, much that is frag- 
mentary. Some suffer from want of culture in taste; they 
have perhaps busied themselves with a very subordinate part 
of the fine arts—with flower-painting, a little music, distiches, 
sonnets or novels. Some know nothing of mathematics, others 
nothing of philosophy. The most learned will perhaps take a 
long time to guess where the entire half, which we call sym- 
pathy, is to be sought in the wide realm of their knowledge. 
Education inevitably suffers from all these deficiencies. The 
degrees in which it suffers are very varied ; it depends on the 
teacher, on the pupil, on opportunities, which may or may not 
present themselves by the way. 
The more honest the teacher is to himself, and the more dex- 
terous he is in the use of existing materials, the better will it be.

It will be seen from the above that the interest of knowledge is limited to

through the four stages, which are paralleled with the stages of human life.

parts. Much can be learned with a good will even during the 
lessons; the novelty of personal interest compensates some- 
times for what is wanting in the ability of the exposition, and 
it is not so difficult for the adult to win a little start of the 
young boy. Such a mode of proceeding is at least always 
better than entirely neglecting important branches of culture, 
and wishing to impart his (the teacher’s) own perfected, but ex- 
tremely limited attainments and school knowledge. 
Sometimes it is only needful to give the pupil the first start 
in certain things, and the teacher continuing to supply motive 
and matter, he goes forward of himself, and is perhaps soon 
beyond the teacher’s sight. In other cases, it is extremely 
difficult to discover anywhere in the stupid head a single mobile 
spot, the merest trace of craving interest. It is just in such 
cases that most knowledge is needed so that experiments 
may be made, and also greater dexterity so that the right 
methods may be detected. If the weaknesses of the teacher 
and the pupil do not cover each other there is nothing to be 
done. 
There is often some one near at hand, who knows how to im- 
part happily enough what we do not ourselves understand, but 
yet find necessary to teach. Then let not the teacher’s vanity 
stand in the way of the use of such a person. To be ignorant 
of something which education has a right to require is truly 
no humiliating confession, for the whole of knowledge is too 
vast for the individual to possess.! 
What remains to be said about individual subjects of instruc- 
tion in connection with the already developed fundamental 
concepts, will be found briefly collected in the following 
chapter. First of all a distinction, as a result of which these 
subjects more or less directly affect our Interest, requires our 
attention. 
1 Herbart gave practical proof in his teacher years that the spirit of 
conceit had no place in him. Being himself comparatively ignorant of 
natural history, and seeing a knowledge of it would be desirable for his 
eldest pupil, he attended with him a course of lectures on the subject say- 
ing, ‘‘it would be a pleasure to him to transform himself from Ludwig’s 
teacher into his schoolfellow, in which relation his example ought to be 
of as much value to his pupil, as his instruction.

Instruction then has to do with 
Things 
Forms 
and Symbols. 
| Symbols, for instance languages, obviously afford interest 
only as the medium for the presentation of what they express. 
The form, the universal, that which is separated from things 
by abstraction for instance mathematical figures, metaphysical 
concepts, simple normal relations of the fine arts—these do not 
merely interest directly, but their application can also be 
reckoned on. But if any one would also say of things them- 
selves, the works of nature and art, of men, families, and states, 
that they are interesting only in so far as they are useful to our 
aim, we would ask him not to let an opinion of such evil im- 
port be heard in the sphere of our many-sided effort, or a fatal 
egoism might ultimately remain as the only immediate interest. 
Symbols are to instruction an obvious burden which, if not 
lightened by the power of interest in the thing symbolised, 
throws both teacher and pupil out of the track of progressive 
. culture. Notwithstanding this, the study of languages monopo- 
lizes such a considerable part of instruction! If the teacher 
yields to the usual claims of prejudice and custom, he inevit- 
ably degenerates from the teacher to the schoolmaster, and 
when school lessons no longer educate, then all that is common 
in the surroundings forthwith draws the boy down to its level, 
inward tact disappears, supervision becomes necessary, and his 
occupation becomes distasteful to the man. Make therefore a 
stand as long as possible against every instruction in language 
without exception, which does not directly lie on the high road 
of the culture of interest.1 Whether ancient or modern lan- 
guage it isall the same. That book alone has a claim to be read 
which interests now, and can prepare the way for fresh interest 
in the future. Over no other, especially over no sort of Chres- 
tomathy, which is always an aimless rhapsody, ought a single 
week to be lost, for a week to a boy is a long period; if the in-

  Many-Sidedness of Interest. 151 
  fluence of education be weakened for the space of one day, it 
can be directly traced in him. Still with any book in use for 
the lesson, however difficult its language, all difficulties are 
surmountable by skill, patience and effort. 
The art of imparting the knowledge of symbols is however, 
identical with that of instructing in the sphere of things. 
Symbols from a certain point of view are things; they are per- 
ceived, observed, copied like things. The more powerfully 
and variously they impress themselves on the senses, the better. 
Clearness, association, arrangement and regular progress must 
follow one another in strict sequence. The meaning of symbols 
must not be too hastily insisted on; it should be left entirely on 
one side for a time; time will be gained thereby. Moreover 
there is no object in learning the theory of symbols thoroughly 
at first. Only so much should be taught as is absolutely neces- 
sary for the next interesting use of them; then the feeling of 
need for a closer knowledge will soon awake, and when this co- 
operates all will go on more easily. 
In considering Forms, or the abstract, it is first of all neces- 
sary to remember in general, what is often urged in special cases, 
namely that while the abstract itself should never appear to 
become a thing, its meaning must be always verified by actual 
application to things. Abstraction should take place from 
examples, from the observed, from the given, and though 
individual acts of concentration (Vertiefungen) upon pure form 
are necessary, reflection (Besinnung) must always be kept in 
close contact with actuality. 
The boy stands in the middle between Platonic ideas and 
noumenal existence. As little as the abstract ought to be 
for him a reality, so little is it his business to search behind 
sensuous phenomena for the unattainable substance, and behind 
his consciousness for the pure Ego, or even behind the many 
for the One, which is not many and yet is All. Should he at any 
time successfully enter into these modes of presentation, it is to 
be hoped that he, first in full possession of his own impartial 
senses, may go on till he comes to that elastic spot (the knotty 
point) which drives mathematicians off at a bound.!

Things, then, are to the boy nothing more than the given com- 
binations of those properties which we take out in abstraction, 
and contemplate separately. There is, therefore, a path from 
individual properties (form's) to things in which they exist 
side by side; there is also a reverse path from things to the 
properties into which they can be analysed. Upon this rests 
the difference between synthetic and analytic instruction which 
is discussed in the following chapter. 
But unhappily it is not easy to every one to comprehend things 
| as aggregates of properties. To every one of us, each thing is 
a confused mass of its properties, whose unity we blindly pre- 
suppose, of whose possible manifold subordination under each of 
its properties, we hardly think. Noneeven of our philosophers 
appears to have perfectly thought out either the one or the 
other. The consequence is the constraint and inflexibility of 
minds which do not know how to seize the actual in the midst 
of the possible. But I cannot here explain everything; to 
many difficulties other investigations must lend assistance. 
IV. 
Manner of Instruction. 
Manner is welcome nowhere, and yet it is found everywhere ; 
how can it possibly be otherwise P Every man develops it with 
his individuality, and in every joint labour such as this between 
teacher and pupil, it is present on both sides. 
Nevertheless individuals become accustomed to each other, 
at least in a certain degree. Beyond this, lies the insufferable, 
which becomes ever more repugnant by repetition. To this 
belongs the affected, and the directly disagreeable. The 
latter is unpardonable, because it is a wilful fault; the former 
ee 
the higher forms of abstraction. He ought first to give himself up unre- 
servedly to external impressions, and to collecting facts of experience tiil he 
arrives at ‘“‘the elastic spot’ where he becomes conscious of that antithesis 
between being and becoming, between the multitude of properties, aud the 
unity of the thing, the reconcilement and explanation of which have given 
rise to the philosophical theories of every age, and to the assumptions of 
metaphysicians amongst them. 
 
-P-A-G-E-173
Many-Sidedness of Interest. 153 
wears out patience, because the impression of disagreeableness 
is strengthened by repetition. 
Let every affected manner be banished from instruction ! 
Catechising as well as dogmatising, fun as well as pathos, 
polished speech as well as sharp accent—all are distasteful, as 
soon as they seem arbitrary additions, and not to proceed from 
the subject and state of mind. But out of many things and 
situations there are developed many modes and turns of the 
lesson. Hence, that which teachers have discovered and so 
abundantly recommended under the high-sounding name of 
Methods, will increase more and more, and can be variously 
used without one or other gaining unconditional superiority. 
The teacher must be capable of many happy turns, he must 
vary with facility, must adapt himself to opportunity, and while 
playing with the accidental must so much the more emphasize 
the essential. 
All mannerisms that compel the listener’s passivity, and ex- 
tract from him a painful negation of his proper activity, are in 
themselves unpleasant and oppressive. Therefore the logically 
connected lesson must set the mind in motion by ever-eager 
expectation, or where the teacher cannot do this—and with 
children it is difficult—then the lesson must not aim at being 
continuous, but permit interruptions, or itself cause them. That 
manner is the best, which provides the greatest amount of 
freedom within the circle which the work in question makes 
necessary to preserve. For the rest, let it only put the teacher 
as well as the taught at their ease. Hvery one has his own in- 
dividual way, which he cannot altogether ignore without loss of 
ease. Therefore so far as no real harm is done, veniam damus

discovered the method xar’ éfox7v, the absolute method, and called the rest,

honour, while connecting with the word Method an entirely different idea.

  CHAPTER V. 
COURSE OF INSTRUCTION. 
To apply in practice everything hitherto developed, interwoven 
together, and connected with the manifold objects in our 
world, is the great and really immeasurable task of those who 
aim at educating through instruction. By means of a few 
general concepts, direction may be given to what in its working 
out would require the unceasing effort of many individuals and 
much time. 
What I mean to give here is only a sketch. It is merely in- 
tended to make the combination of the concepts already de- 
veloped easier, and to prepare a view of the field of work which 
lies before us. The general science of education ought not to 
allow itself to be absorbed to such an extent by special details, 
that its survey is contracted from the whole to any part. To 
guard against this, I myself would seek to attain through the 
sensuous, to the mental eye, and try to include in our survey 
what must at the same time be thought out and put into 
practice. 
I. 
Merely Presentative-—-Analytical—Synthetical Instruction. 
Whenever it may happen that a plan of instruction has to be 
made for any individual, there will always be an existent circle 
of intercourse and experience in which that individual is 
placed. Perhaps this circle is capable of being judiciously 
widened according to the idea of balanced many-sidedness, or 
its contents may be more thoroughly examined ; this is the first 
thing which requires attention. 
But further, the vital fulness, the penetrating clearness of 
experience and intercourse allow of being carried beyond their 
circle, or rather many parts of instruction can be advantageously 
placed in the light which radiates from them. From the horizon 
which bounds the eye, we can take measurements, by which
-P-A-G-E-175

Many-Sidedness of Interest. 155 
through descriptions of the next-lying territory, that horizon 
can be enlarged. The child may be led back by the life thread | 
of older persons surrounding it ; we can generally render percep- | 
tible to the senses through mere presentation everything sufi- 
ciently similar to, and bound up with, what the boy till then 
has observed. Thus there are word-pictures of foreign towns, 
countries, customs, opinions, coloured by what he knows; there 
are historical descriptions which deceive by a kind of presence, 
because they borrow the features of the present. Instruction 
may at this stage summon to its assistance all kinds of pictures; 
they will give it all the more aid, the less they have been pre- 
viously misused by being looked at thoughtlessly, or as a sense- 
less pastime. 
Mere description must lose in clearness and penetration the 
further it is removed from the child’s intellectual horizon ; it 
will, on the other hand, gain in power in proportion as the hori- 
zon widens. For this reason, it is uncertain in what way, and 
to what extent, we may reckon upon it, just as it is also diffi- 
cult to prescribe rules for it. For, according to its nature, 
this species of instruction has but one law—to describe im such 
a way that the pupil believes he sees what is described. 
Supported more by its own strength, analytical instruction 
attains also more to the general. That it may be known, at 
least approximately, to what I refer, I instance Pestalozzi’s 
Mother’s Book (Buch der Miitter), and Niemeyer’s Exercises in 
Understanding (Verstandesiibungen). Every thoughtful teacher 
is led by his healthy tact to analyse the masses which accumu- 
late in children’s brains, and which are increased by merely 
descriptive instruction, and he must concentrate attention such 
cessively on the little and the least, to secure clearness and 
transparency in all presentations. This must be carried out. 
The contemporaneous environment can be analysed into sepa- 
rate things, the things into their component parts, and these 
last again into properties. Properties, elements, things, and 
the entire environment may be used for abstraction, so as 
to form out of them various formal concepts. But there are 
not only contemporaneous, there are also successive properties 
in things, and the mutability of things gives occasion to analyse 
 
-P-A-G-E-176
  156 Science of Education. 
  events into the successions! which in those events run through 
and along with one another. In all these attempts we come 
in part on that which cannot be separated, i.e. on law for 
speculation, and in part on that which should, or should not be 
separated, ¢.e. on the esthetic for taste. 
Intercourse can also be analysed, and we can concentrate the 
mind on the particular feelings of sympathy which it supplies. 
And this must be done, that the feelings may be purified and gain 
in fervour. For the sum total of feeling towards a person, and 
indeed towards a number of persons, is always composed of 
many separate feelings, and from the feelings against others, 
those for them must be carefully distinguished, that egoism 
may not suppress sympathy, at least not unobserved. Women 
of fine feeling best understand how to analyse intercourse, to 
introduce more sympathetic consideration among children, and 
thereby to increase their points of contact, and heighten the 
intensity of intercourse. One can easily see whether a person 
in early years has come under such womanly influence. 
Whilst then analytical instruction dissects the particular 
which it meets with, it reaches upwards into the sphere of the 
universal. For the particular takes its constituents out of the 
universal. We remember at any rate the definition, ‘ Per 
genus proximum, et differentiam specificam,” and recollect that 
the specific difference, taken separately, is also a genus, in 
which, just as in the first, higher genera can be contained, together 
with the differences appertaining thereto, of each of which 
again the same holds true.? So it is well to bear in mind how 
  1 Herbart seems to be referring here, first to the necessary successions of 
cause and effect, and then to varying successions of mere co-existence. 
2 The definitions, ‘‘ Per genus proximum, et differentiam specificam,” 
serve to make a concept clear, that is, to preserve its contents completely 
by specification of its genus (Gattung) and its differentia (Artunterschiede) ; 
it suffices to give the next highest genus (genus proximum) and the specific 
difference (differentia specifica) of the concept to be defined. For instance, 
a square is a four-cornered figure all the angles of which are right angles and 
all its sides equal. Since however, as Herbart further remarks, not only the 
given genus (four-cornered figure), but also the differences taken each by 
itself contain further higher genera together with differences which again 
can be analysed into these, the definition of a thing at last resolves the con- 
cept into a complex of simple properties which all belong to it. Thus, for 
instance, in the definition of the concept square, the genus concept four-

logic and the doctrine of combination come in contact with 
each other, and why the analysis of what is combined within 
the mental horizon of an individual points to the logic of the 
universal, and thus increases the receptiveness of the mind 
for other new comprehensions, in which the elements already 
known may occur in new forms and with new combinations. 
Doubtless this occurs originally in us all, and over that 
which takes place spontaneously, the fenphor ought to detain 
neither himself nor the children. But still it does not take 
place so completely and quickly but that much work remains 
for the teacher, who in any case must observe his pupils. 
Inasmuch as analytical instruction rises upwards to the 
general, it facilitates and assists all kinds of judgments. For 
the matter to be judged is there purified from confusing side 
issues ; the simple is more easily penetrated than the complex. 
The elementary presentations have acquired more strength, and 
distraction caused by the number and variety is at an end. 
Besides the general judgments lie ready alike for future use 
and future examination on new occasions. 
The association of premisses likewise, upon which facility 
in drawing logical conclusions entirely depends—the scientific 
imagination—gains much by repeated analysis of what is given. 
For just because experience is no system, it best provides for 
the varied mixture and fusion of our thoughts, if we do but 
always accompany our experience with thought. 
But all the advantages of analytical instruction are fettered 
and limited by the limitation of that which experience and inter- 
course, together with the descriptions connected with them, have 
been able to supply. Analysis must accept material as it finds 
it. Further, the repetition of sensuous impressions, by which 
a preponderance is created on one side, is often stronger than 
the artificially produced concentrations and considerations by 
which the teacher strives to counteract it on the other. Moreover 
the general, which only in certain cases is brought into notice by 
cornered, and the differences which can be also considered as genus concepts, 
i.e. equal sides and right angles, can be again defined, so that in the 
definition of square an increasing number of simple properties contained in 
it make their appearance. (Anmerkung von Cari Richter.)
-P-A-G-E-178

158 Science of Education. 
  abstraction, reaches with effort that free position in the mind 
by which it proves equally efficacious whether as general or in 
dealing with all special combinations. And, properly speaking, 
analysis is not able to do more for speculation and esthetic 
judgment than lay bare the points with which they are con- 
cerned. We know that experience can give us neither the 
theoretical nor the ewsthetical necessity, therefore necessity 
cannot be discovered as such by the analysis of the given. 
Even analytical examination of accepted speculative and 
esthetic modes of presentation, although it could make us 
feel what is wrong, nevertheless seldom attains to that strength 
of (the new) impression necessary to erase the earlier one; it 
never reaches that sufficiency which is a necessity to the awak- 
ened mind. Confutation and criticism alone can effect little; 
the right standard must be set up. 
Synthetic instruction, which builds with its own stones, is 
alone capable of erecting the entire structure of thought which 
education requires. It certainly cannot be richer than our 
sciences or our literature, but still for that very reason it is 
incomparably richer than the individual environment of the 
child. Nor indeed will it be richer than the means which the 
teacher possesses, but the idea itself will gradually creaté abler 
teachers. The whole of mathematics with what precedes and 
follows, the entire progress of humanity in the steps of culture 
from ancient to modern, belong to synthetic instruction. But 
there also belong to it the multiplication tables, vocables and 
grammar, and thus we are easily reminded how much harm 
may be done in this sphere by wrong treatment. If the ele- 
ments must necessarily be imprinted on the mind by mere 
learning by rote, schoolboys would have had good reason to 
protest against all extension of synthetic instruction. Dicta- 
tion, repetition, recapitulation, examples, symbols of all kinds 
are well-known means of mitigating this evil. I have suggested 
marking out with bright nails on a board the typical triangles, 
and placing them continually within sight of the child in its 
cradle. I was laughed at.2 Well, people may laugh at me 
1 Aisthetische Darstellung, page 64. 
2 Herbart borrowed the idea of the much-ridiculed cradle instruction from

  ——- 
still more! For I, in thought, place near this board, sticks and 
balls painted with various colours; I constantly change, com- 
bine, and vary these sticks, and later on plants and the child’s 
playthings of every kind. I take a little organ into the nursery 
and sound simple tones and intervals on it fora minute at a 
time. I adda pendulum to it for the child’s eye and for the 
unpractised player’s hand, that its rhythmic proportions may 
be observed. I would further exercise the child’s sense to 
distinguish cold and heat by the thermometer, and to estimate 
the degrees of heaviness by weights. Finally, I would send 
him to school with the cloth manufacturer to learn as cor- 
rectly as he, to distinguish finer and coarser wool by touch. 
Yes, who knows whether I would not adorn the walls of the 
nursery with very large gaily painted letters. At the founda- 
tion of all this lies the simple thought that the abrupt and 
troublesome process of stamping things on the mind, called 
learning by heart, will be either not necessary, or very easy, 
if only the elements of synthesis are early made constituent 
parts of the child’s daily experience. They will then, so far 
as possible, steal imperceptibly in among the incomparably 
greater accumulation of things with their names which, at 
the time of learning to speak, can be comprehended with such 
wonderful facility. But I am not the fool to think the salva- 
tion of mankind depends on such trifling aids which may more 
or less lighten and forward instruction. 
But now to our subject. The object of synthetical instruc- 
tion is twofold; it must supply the elements and prepare their 
Pestalozzi, who himself found it in a peasant’s cottage. In How Gertrude 
Taught her Children, Pestalozzi says, ‘‘ We are not so advanced as the Appen- 
zell woman, who hangs a large paper bird gaily painted over her infant’s 
cradle. Any one who has seen how the child of two or three weeks old tries 
to get at the bird, with his hands and feet, and then thinks how easy it would 
be by a series of such objects to lay a general basis for the sensuous observ- 
ation of natural and artistic things in the child’s mind, which could be 
gradually more exactly defined and always extended—whoever, I say, thinks 
of this, and then does not feel what we miss, in our not merely Gothic- 
monkish, but crippled Gothic-monkish rut of education, which has become 
obnoxious even to ourselves, is past amending. The Appenzell bird is to 
me, as the bull was to the Egyptians—a sacred thing, and I have done my 
very best to begin my education at the point from which the Appenzell 
woman starts.”
-P-A-G-E-180

  combination ; prepare, I say, not entirely perfect it. For such 
perfecting is endless! Who can measure all the relations of 
all kinds of things? The cultivated man works ever unceasingly 
on his thought-building ; but it is culture in youth which must 
supply him with means to work at it on many sides. It must 
also, after the elements, provide every possible method and 
facility for their use. 
The most general kind of synthesis is the combinative It 
is found everywhere, it contributes in everything to mental 
activity, and therefore must be exercised as much and as early 
as possible, till the greatest facility in its use is attained. It 
holds sway principally in the province of empiricism, where 
nothing hinders it from affording the recognition of the (logical) 
possible, of which the incidental real forms a part, and under 
which it can be classified in many ways. From this point it 
finds its way to the practical sciences, where it is the helper 
when successions of ideas have to be applied to successive 
aspects of a given manifold, of which the science of education 
will shortly afford an example. In the sphere of speculation 
the loss of this combinative synthesis may be sorely felt if it 
is wanting; this mathematicians have realised. Alike here, and 
in the sphere of taste, 1t becomes obscured through the peculiar 
kind of synthesis which rules therein, and which partly rejects 
inadmissible connections, and partly removes the mind from 
all irrelevant play of thought. 
Closely connected with the combinative concepts are those 
of number. Each combinative act is made up of a number of 
elements of complexion; number itself is the abstraction of 
these. 
Forms proper to empirical synthesis are, as is well known, - 
those in space and time, the geometric and the rhythmic. To 
1 Herbart further insists on the importance of this form of synthesis in 
his Aphorisms to Pedagogy, thus: ‘‘ Combination occurs in 1 and 1, in one 
times 1, in the A B C of Anschauwng, in grammar, in vatural history, chem- 
istry, mathematics, logic—in a word, in all knowledge. Everywhere it 
is the easiest process and the most neglected. To the teacher it is of infinite 
importance for the opportunity it gives him of exhibiting the same object 
in varied ways.”
-P-A-G-E-181
    Many-Sidedness of Interest. 161 
these belong the ABO of Anschauung. It is synthetic, since 
it proceeds from the elements, although its arrangement is 
determined by the analytical consideration of the forms which 
occur in nature, and which must permit of being brought back 
to nature again. 
Speculative synthesis proper, entirely different from the 
logical-combinative, rests on relationships.1 But the method 
of the relationships no one knows, and it is not the business 
of education to exhibit it. Neither is it the business of early 
years to take up a critical attitude towards nature. On the other 
hand, it is just as little desirable to leave the mind altogether 
unpractised in speculation, till those years when an impatient 
longing for conviction (certitude) develops of itself, and ob- 
stinately seizes the best theory which first comes to hand, with 
which to satisfy itself. This neglect is least of all desirable 
in our day, when the disruption of opinions affects every one, 
and only the frivolously-minded, or those filled with a resig- 
nation as rash as melancholy, can give up the quest for truth. 
On the contrary must the teacher seek out, entirely regardless 
of his system, the least dangerous ways to prepare capacity 
for investigation as much as possible, and to awaken on many 
sides the impelling feeling aroused by single problems—the 
elements of speculation—for fear the young thinker should 
believe that he will soon be at the end of his search. The 
safest without doubt is the study of mathematics; unfor- 
tunately, it has too much degenerated into a game assisted 
by lines and formule. Let it be led back, as far as possible, 
to the thinking out of the concepts themselves. Logic is also 
serviceable, but too much must not be expected from it. Among 
the problems of philosophical speculation, those are to be most 
thoroughly developed which are connected with mathematics, 
physics, chemistry ; the youthful mind can, under skilful guid- 
ance, be variously employed to its great advantage in those 
which concern liberty, morality, happiness, right, and the State. 
Everything bordering on religion? needs great discretion. As 
1 The method of searching for necessary complementary concepts when 
they are hidden, Herbart calls the Method of Relationships (Beziehumgen). 
2 Herbart urges the necessity of the early foundation of religiow in his 
M

  162 Science of Education. 
long as possible the religious feeling, which ought from the 
earliest years to depend on the single thought—Providence— 
must be preserved undisturbed. But all religion has a tendency 
to enter spontaneously into speculation, and expand itself into 
self-sufficient dogmas. This tendency will not fail to be aroused 
in a mind beginning to be trained by many-sided culture. Then 
it is time to speak a serious word—of the fruitless attempts 
of many mature minds of all times to find fixed doctrines in 
religion ; of the necessity with regard to such subjects of await- 
ing the end of all preparatory speculative activity; of the 
impossibility of suddenly restoring a lost religious feeling by 
speculative conviction ; of the concurrence of the order of nature 
encompassing us with the inexorable needs which the spectacle 
of human dependence creates in us, and by which religion is 
firmly rooted in the ground of sympathy. Positive religion 
does not come into the province of the teacher as such, but into 
that of the church and the parents; in no case ought he to put 
the slightest obstacle in the way, and, at least among Protest- 
ants, he cannot reasonably desire to be allowed to do so. 
The theory of Taste is too obscure for any one to undertake 
to point out the elements of the various forms of the esthetic 
and their synthesis. But it is easy to agree in this—that 
esthetic worth lies not in the matter, but in relationships; 
that taste is founded not in what is perceived, but in the 
mode of perceiving. Our temper of mind is spoiled for nothing 
so easily as for the beautiful. Even to the child’s clear eye 
the beautiful is not clear, although it may seem to us it needs 
Aphorisms thus: ‘‘ The foundations of religious interest must be laid deep 
and in early life—so deep that in later years the mind rests untroubled in its 
religion, while speculation follows its own course. Philosophy as such is 
neither orthodox nor heterodox, and faith is, of course, not philosophy.” On 
the use of religious instruction in education, he writes in the same place: 
“ Education must look upon religion not as objective, but as subjective. 
Religion befriends and protects, but nevertheless it must not be given to the 
child too circumstantially. Its work must be directing rather than teaching. 
It must never exhaust susceptibility, and therefore above all must not be 
prematurely made use of. It must not be given dogmatically to arouse 
doubt, but in union with knowledge of nature and the repression of egotism. 
It must ever point beyond, but never instruct beyond the bounds of know- 
ledge, for then the paradox would follow, that instruction knows what it does 
not know.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-183

  only to be seen. For the uncultured eye doubtless sees the 
mass; it doubtless grasps everything placed before it, but it 
does not of itself gather up the threads of the relationships, as 
the cultivated man in his best hours loves to do, and does most 
easily. Taste and imagination generally go together, although 
the two are entirely different. It is easy to imagine how 
the latter can aid the former. For example, in the ever-shift- 
ing pictures of the imagination, the relationships change, and 
amongst these numerous relationships are some which rivet 
attention by their effect, and group other pictures around 
them. In this way the mind creates poetry. The problem 
for synthetic culture of taste would accordingly be how to 
cause the Beautiful to arise in the pupil’s imagination. When- 
ever possible, the material must first be supplied; afterwards 
the imagination must be occupied with it by conversation, and 
then the work of art be shown. The contents of a classical 
drama should first be related—not the sequence of the scenes, 
but the action. We should try to grasp the relationships, 
the situations of the action; they must be conbined first in 
one way, then in another, and pictured here and there; then 
finally the poet will complete what would be too difficult for 
us. The idealized embodiment of special moments in the 
action might be attempted, and a picture or a piece of sculp- 
ture might be found which would present the group to us. 
With music everything is more definite ; the fundamental re- 
lationships with their simplest synthesis are in the hands of 
the teacher of thorough bass, who however must not be a 
pedant. 
We come to that instruction the task of which is to cultivate 
Sympathy synthetically. Through it the heart must become 
large and full, even in those cases where there are no sweet 
family relationships, no happy youthful friendships, perhaps even 
no high degree of natural liking between teacher and pupil, to 
come to its aid. Where is such an instruction to be found? 
Must it not be acknowledged that the ordinary method of study 
seems to aim at crushing the mind under its load, and chilling 
it by the seriousness of science and even of much lauded 
art? Does not this ordinary method of study, we ask, seem to 
 
-P-A-G-E-184
  164 _ Science of Education. 
alienate us from men, from individual real human beings, and 
the individual real circles that they form? They may be little 
to our taste, too lowly for speculation, and mostly too far re- 
moved from observation; but to work for them out of sym- 
pathy is our most gracious ornament, and to their race we 
must acknowledge, perhaps with a feeling of humiliation, but 
in any case necessarily, that we belong. 
We have tabulated the combinative scaffolding of history— 
this varied series of names from different countries run off on 
a chronological thread—in order that it may be impressed on 
the memory. We have tried to gain from the study of 
languages and knowledge of antiquity, exercises for the 
reasoning intellect. We have also elevated the poets of old 
as models of all art. All most admirable! Finally, we have 
attempted to grasp with various imported ideas the history of 
humanity in one view as a vast development—and then we 
turned our eyes away again, and not without reason, for truly 
as a drama the whole is not a whole, is not very elevating or 
satisfying. Must it then amidst all this be forgotten, that here 
on every hand we are speaking of human beings to whom 
sympathy is due, to whom we ought to bring none but sym- 
pathizing on-lookers; and that this sympathy comes most 
naturally to those, who cannot as yet look with us into the 
future, because they have hitherto not so much as understood 
the present, and for whom on this very account the past is the 
true present? Is not the childlikeness—that common posses- 
sion of all ancient Greek authors—sufficient to break down the 
self-important learned feeling with which we sit down to them, 
or rather, have we so little feeling ourselves not to observe that 
a time of youth is depicted there, such as we ought to have 
passed through, but by no means an age of men to which we 
now might well return ? ' 
We can no longer escape the distorted culture of which we 
are often painfully sensible. We feel that something has been 
left behind which we ought to have with us. Vainly would we 
wish to make it up by efforts that would only put us to shame.

  But nothing prevents us from allowing our younger brothers 
to begin from the beginning, that they may then go straight- 
forward into the future, independent of extraneous support. 
If they would, however, continue the work of their fore- 
fathers, they must have travelled the same way; before all 
things they must have learned to recognize these forefathers as 
their own from their early years. 
We are then in no difficulty regarding the object of sympa- 
thy. Shall we set about the work synthetically, elementarily ? 
In the first instance we will not enumerate the elements of 
sympathy, we will not combine them formally according to a 
synthetic method. Here warmth of mind is needed; not the 
momentary flickering glow from a blazing flame, but one which 
is perpetual, produced by material which permanently develops 
a gentle heat. 
Sympathy further relates to haman emotions ; gradually pro- 
gressing from its elements, it is related to the progress of 
human feelings. The feelings, however, take their direction 
from the condition of men, and advance with it. What we feel 
in society is the outcome of the complicated political and social 
relationships of Europe. If sympathy for society is to arise 
from simple, sincere, transparent feelings, each of which has 
clearly come into consciousness on its own account, so that the 
whole knows what it desires, then it must follow the course of 
human conditions up to the present, beginning from that con- 
dition which is the first to express itself clearly enough, and 
to expand itself sufficiently through the range of the manifold 
movements of the mind which belong to it! For truly the 
1 Herbart in a powerful passage in his Aphorism. zur Péidagogik 
(Werke, ii. 457), too long to quote in full, develops his idea of the course 
history should take, and the purpose it should serve in education. It ends 
thus: ‘‘The youth must see humanity in history rather than men. 
That it is one and the same human nature which passes through so many 
transformations, ought to be to him as valuable as an interpretation of his 
own personality. Moved by the fearful possibility of error and corruption, 
himself still pure and full of force, endowed with what is certain in human 
thought, and inwardly familiarized with the infinite working of external 
Nature in its ordered uniformity, he is capable of resolving, and ripe to resolve 
freely and firmly, upon sympathy with the whole of humanity, and to elevate 
what till now was but a yielding feeling, into a conscious volition.”

  past has divulged but a few of its conditions; still more seldom 
has it impressed itself as clearly and many-sidedly as education 
might wish. Priceless, therefore, are those documents in which 
it speaks to us with full-toned loving voice; we must complete 
the rest in imagination. 
Finally, sympathy develops most naturally, most simply and 
most continuously in the intercourse of children with each 
other. But even this intercourse is determined by the contri- 
butions brought by each to it, these contributions in turn by 
the occupations and outlook of each, and the occupations and 
outlook again (if the children are not allowed to grow up wild) 
without doubt by the material given to their minds to work 
upon. It cannot be denied that the intercourse of boys and 
youths is totally different according to the guidance they re- 
ceive. If this guidance advances by leaps and bounds, then 
they have trouble in following; they follow unwillingly, they 
retreat into their childish play and pursuits, they mutually 
strengthen themselves therein by their intercourse. There 
comes, however, a time when they must go forth into society, 
into the world. What wonder if they there mutually hold 
themselves aloof—if they, going without sympathy as if among 
strangers, persevere the more obstinately together in their 
trivialities. What wonder if finally society itself is composed 
of a loose heap of little parties, each of which pursues its own 
amusements as best it can, and uses as a means thereto its rela- 
tionships, with the whole. 
How different among a patriotically minded nation! Its 
little six-year old children will tell you stories from its 
chronicles; its children will tell you of the “children of an 
older growth,” the heroes of past ages; they relate the stories 
amongst themselves, they rise upwards in union with their 
country’s history; they strive to become men of the nation, 
and they do become so. The ancients knew their Homer by 
heart; they did not learn it as men, but as boys. He it was 
who formed the general character of the youth, and his pupils 
do him no discredit. Certainly he could not do all, and indeed 
all we would not trust him with. 
Imagine to yourselves a European patriotism !—the Greeks

and Romans our ancestors—the dissensions, unhappy signs of 
party spirit, with which they also must disappear. What can 
give prominence to this thought? Instruction can do so. 
Let no one say that we Germans are too cosmopolitan as it 
is. Too little patriotic—that, alas! unfortunately is true; but 
is it necessary for me here to reconcile patriotism and cosmo- 
politanism ? ; 
Let us return to the ancients. Poets, philosophers, historians 
fall for us here into one series, so far as they unite in impress- 
ing human nature on human hearts. The Homeric Epos, the 
Platonic Dialogue, are not primarily works of art, and books of 
wisdom ; they represent, above all, persons and opinions; they 
ask for these a friendly reception. Bad it is for us that the 
strangers recommended, speak Greek. That makes their kindly 
reception difficult. We must make use of translators, and 
gradually learn the language ourselves. Gradually I say —it 
cannot be done all at once, at least thoroughly. It is a matter 
of importance to us now, so much the more seeing that the 
translators themselves do not speak even the most compre- 
hensible German. In the future, with leisure, we shall try to 
reach refinement of speech, and through that the art of poetry. 
At present both are equally distant from us; the Fables should 
only amuse us, but the characters ought to interest us. To that 
end, a certain philological skill is doubtless indispensable to 
the teacher, that he may confine grammatical instruction 
within the narrowest possible limits, but within them be able 
to carry out that which he begins with strictest consistency. 
Nevertheless this skill must not attempt to gain more than the 
credit of good service. That Homer represents the oldest known 
forms of Greek speech, that the construction is exceedingly 
simple and easy, that the antiquarian gain for all future pro- 
gress in the literature is decisive—these remarks are true, but 
they have no weight in this place. If the difficulty were 
doubled, and the gain of learning but half as great, the pre- 
ceding principles would remain in their incomparable strength. 
But the question is in what spirit does one grasp them ? 
Three steps must be taken in order to work out this special 
part of the art of education. First, a selection must be made,
-P-A-G-E-188

chiefly from Homer, Herodotus, Thucydides, Xenophon, Plu- 
tarch ; from Socrates, Euripides, and Plato, as well as from the 
Romans, who, as soon as there has been due preparation for 
them, must be added to the others. Secondly, the method of 
teaching must be exactly defined; and thirdly, certain auxil- 
iary writings are necessary for all accompaniments of narration 
and examination, which can advantageously go along with them. 
Without wasting time I merely mention that of Homer’s 
works, the cruder Iliad is not suitable, but the entire Odyssey 
is, with the exception of a single long piece in the eighth book 
(individual expressions can be easily avoided). The Philoctetus 
of Sophocles in early years, then the historical writings of 
Xenophon (not, however, the essentially immoral Memorabilia, 
which owe their reputation to the greatest happiness doctrine), 
and in later boyhood, after a few easy Dialogues, the Republic 
of Plato can be read. This last is exactly suited to the 
awakening interest in wider society; in the years when young 
men seriously devote themselves to politics, it is just as little 
satisfying as Homer to a youth, who is just at that period when 
he throws everything childlike behind him. Plato, as the 
teacher of idealism, and Homer, as the poet, always remain for 
riper age; but do not these writers deserve to be read twice ? 
Has not the teacher of youth the choice of spending much or 
little time in his own hands ? 
Enough has been said about synthetic instruction. It must 
be begun early, and its end is not to be found. But it will 
show that parents and youths must extend the years of cul- 
ture further than is now customary, for they will certainly not 
wish to leave the costly fruit of long toil half-ripe to chance. 
For the majority this would be a reason for not beginning, 
but there are those who desire the best if it can only be 
found. 
If a teacher, however, be summoned too late, and does not 
find a retarded childlikeness unspoiled (which is seldom the 
case), let him leave the Greeks on one side, and trust more to 
analytical instruction. Only he must not try to analyse the 
heaped-up accumulation into its smallest parts all at once; the 
concentrations to begin with must on the contrary move in com-
-P-A-G-E-189

  pany, then, by means of continued conversation (which at any 
rate will be naturally suggested by the books chosen within the 
already existent mental scope, which are read together)—then, 
I repeat, by means of this, in the course of continuous feeling 
after the sensitive parts of the mind, one part after another 
must give up its components, not so much to the end that it 
may be corrected, but that the individual may become con- 
scious of his store. As soon then as he has become an object 
of self-observation it will be seen how he pleases himself, how 
much power he possesses, where and how synthetic help can be 
given to him.! 
For mere descriptive instruction, we must desire in the 
teacher, as remarked above, vivacity and the spirit of observa- 
tion in place of rules. The concepts developed in a previous 
chapter are to be applied in combination to analytical and 
synthetical instruction. Only the reader must bear in mind 
that merely a sketch is now given, and he will not expect a 
more detailed articulation of instruction within the narrow 
limits of a synopsis.

To point out, name, and give permission to handle and move 
things takes precedence of everything else. This process is ap- 
plied first to the whole, then by degrees to its parts, and finally 
again to the components of those parts. The parts are associated 
by determining their relative position. Objects are analysed 
into their properties, and the properties are associated by com- 
parisons. When the manifold in a circle of experience is 
sufficiently worked out in this way, then the events arising

The analytical examination 
of the circle of experience 
meets everywhere with signs 
of an ordered coherence in 
the nature of things—with 
intimations of causal relation- 
ships. Without questioning 
whether these signs have 
objective authority—whether 
they may be described as im- 
manent or transcendent,——it is 
important to the culture of 
youth that they should be com- 
prehended as they occur, that 
the uniformity of nature in 
the entire course of events 
should be traced out with 
the eye of the physicist or 
scientific historian, and not of 
the fatalist talkers. The first 
steps consist in pointing out

When they have looked at

is the time to try whether

Sympathy with Mankind. 
The main idea for the analysis of intercourse for the awaken- 
ing of sympathy with individuals is to lead back the inclina- 
tions, the lower as well as the higher, to natwral affections, 
the possibility of which every one finds in his own consciousness, 
with which therefore he can sympathize. But a genuine un- 
derstanding of the feelings of others, presupposes the com- 
  Sympathy with Society. 
Considerations regarding the 
proprieties of intercourse, and 
social institutions of all kinds, 
point back to the necessity 
that men should accommodate 
and help each other. Sup- 
ported by such necessity, in- 
struction explains the forms 
of social subordination and co- 
ordination. To make this per- 
ceptible, it takes, in preference 
to anything else, the nearest 
example—the pupil himself; 
all his social relationships are 
placed in their true position, 
and he should be made to feel 
the conditions and dependence 
of his existence in their en- 
tirety. While sympathy trans- Religion. 
Sympathy with the univer-

changes which each undergoes. The use which the individual 
makes of things is evolved. The concepts of cause and effect, 
of means and end, which have no place here, may be omitted. 
Empiricism has only to do with the sequence of events, with 
the course of their succession. The object of this analysis in 
youth, is on the one side the human body (even amongst out- 
ward objects the most important, for individuals are not only 
conscious of their own, they see also the bodies of other human 
beings), on the other side it is the sum of surrounding things,

tions of condition and depend- 
ence must reveal themselves 
through varying experiments 
with varying results, as for 
instance by driving a machine 
more quickly or more slowly, 
and checking it here and there 
to show which wheels move, 
and which do not. To this 
end we must be master of the 
result; it must attract atten- 
tion, but not be too common 
or startling. The individual 
experiments previously pre- 
sented should be associated 
and exhibited in association,

for taste. For instance, we 
should take a _ well-grown 
shrub, then cut a single 
branch from it, just where 
it shoots forth, then from this 
a leaf, and from the compound 
leaf a single leaflet, or the 
flower from which the petals 
can be separated and singly 
shown. False division—for 
instance, a cut in the middle 
of the leaf—the pupil must 
observe and criticise. In this 
way, the simplest form of the 
beautiful, the articulation of 
the composite beautiful, and 
the new beauty of the fresh 
outlines recombined—each of 
these must be individually 
comprehended and associated.

youthful soul to itself; it should discover in itself the type 
of the movements of the human mind. It must also learn to

the particular without throw-

Nor is it wise to commence 
with objects too large; the 
simpler produce clearer judg-

Synthetic instruction supplies a number of new presenta-

whether it overfills the mind, or leaves it too empty. We shall 
find here that not only the capacities, but also the disposition 
varies at different times, and the treatment must be regulated 
accordingly. Further, government and discipline, but above all, 
the whole concentration of the teacher on the subject in hand, 
should operate in arousing an effort to comprehend everything 
completely, correctly, and immediately, and to grasp it clearly 
and luminously. Finally, beware of building too quickly on

respect to what is complex, it is very important, as far as 
possible, to occupy the mind with its forms, that it may anti-

To men above all, to humanity diverse as it is, and as it may 
and will be found by us, a sympathy is due, which cannot merely 
develop analytically from intercourse with individuals known 
or described, and which is still less likely to grow from any 
general concept of race, such as humanity. Those alone partly 
possess, and can in some degree impart it, who have created 
within themselves numberless varied pictures of humanity— 
only the worthiest, as supplied by poets, and next to them by his-

of the cases where many conceivable complications are absent in

the inflexions by which they are expressed in the different 
languages. Further we have to distinguish clearly each sepa- 
rate concept with its inflexions, from the development of the 
type of conjugation, which merely arises out of the variations 
of these inflexions. But this type would develop naturally if,

pointed out, such as those of the Future, Perfect, Subjunctive, 
Optative, and searched for in simple words, then the less con-

to be specially learned. The mind is thus occupied with con- 
jugation; its varieties are associated in all possible ways before 
the step to learning by heart is taken, though this can by no 
means be dispensed with. With sufficient practice in combina- 
tion, facility in applying the type to other forms is acquired ; 
this takes place when the order of the series is changed by 
variation. A yet simpler example would be the musical score,

The combinatory survey—a treasure beyond price, in all

boyhood, which must be kept entirely distinct from the sympa-

should precede this period. In the framework, many series of

IV. 
On Plans of Instruction. 
We see at the first glance that the foregoing synopses are not 
intended as a plan of instruction, since so much is included in 
them which does not allow of a fixed course of lessons, but de- 
pends much rather on opportunities of combining it with some 
kind of instruction. The Plan of Instruction is the preparation 
of these opportunities. It cannot be. sketched out until the 
teacher, having maturely considered the circle of thought here 
marked out, has placed his collected knowledge within it, and 
has sufficiently investigated the pupil’s needs. The plan of in- 
struction, if it is to be effectual, must be dependent on many 
contingencies, which have nothing in common with the general 
idea of many-sided cultivation. For this efficacy proceeds from 
the individual powers of the teacher and the pupil; these, taken 
as they are found, must be used to the greatest advantage. 
Much depends on the degree and the manner in which the 
pupil answers to the teacher’s efforts. An instruction which

begins betimes, and which will be chiefly synthetic, can pretty 
well rely upon the power it exercises through what it offers. 
But the pupil ought properly speaking to provide the material for 
analytical instruction, especially in later years when the hoard of 
ordinary experience is used up, and only that which has already 
sunk into the depths of the mind is worth analysis. In ac- 
cordance with this, the fact is easily explained, that when 
grown-up youths express themselves openly, the influence of 
education succeeds very quickly, and particularly at the com- 
mencement (so far as analysis goes) almost marvellously; if, on 
the contrary, they are reserved, all effort is useless. 
The medium proper of analytical instruction is conversa- 
tion, woven together, maintained in its course by independent 
reading, and, when possible, supplemented by written papers 
which the pupil and teacher lay before each other. The read- 
ing must be in a familiar tongue, must have numerous points 
 
-P-A-G-E-208
  188 Science of Education. 
  of contact with the pupil, and not interest to such a degree that 
frequent interruptions—possibly long digressions which ought 
to be pleasing to him—should become distasteful. The exer- 
cises must be neither long nor artificial, but clearly and per- 
ceptibly reproduce with the utmost care the material of the 
conversation, besides distinctly and strikingly expressing its 
main thoughts. They must prove that the mind is concen- 
trated on its subject. If the pupil does not do this satisfac. 
torily, the teacher must improve on it. He may, if necessary, 
use argument and disputation to brace up slackness, only on 
no account grow hot himself. In cases of retarded youthful 
culture, education must lay most stress on such exercises, and 
try to arrange them in such a manner that by degrees they 
touch all sides of interest. To fill up the mind, we can add 
some sort of vigorous descriptive instruction, and even join on 
some allied studies, unimportant in themselves, but yet as 
greatly contrasted as possible. This will be the whole form 
of the plan of instruction in those cases where education has 
already lost her fairest rights; but, as an addition, these exer- 
cises will be almost indispensable, even with an otherwise 
synthetically progressing instruction, in order that what is 
going on in the mind may not escape the vigilance of the 
teacher. 
If synthetic instruction begins at the right time, and with 
promising expectations, it will easily find in the preceding de- 
velopments the two main threads! which run from one end of 
1 In his fourth letter to Herr von Steiger, Herbart, then in the midst 
of his practical work as teacher, defines the “ Hauptfiden” thus :—‘‘I 
picture the whole instruction of the young as running on two lines, one for 
the understanding, the other for feeling and imagination.” In cultivating 
the understanding he recommends mathematics because its truths are cer- 
tain and enduring, and physics, for which mathematics in a great measure 
prepare the way. The heart he considers will be best trained by the gradual 
guidance of all feelings and by lessons of morality, which since they must 
never present difficulties to the intellect must be carefully suited to the age 
of the child, and never interrupted, because the moral feeling needs increas- 
ingly better nourishment. This moral feeling must be given through various 
interesting representations, which by the approval or disapproval they 
arouse will lead the child to form principles for himself. ‘‘And,” he asks, 
“to this end what can we do better than follow the traces of moral growth in 
humanity and, guided by the hand of history, enter the school of Socrates,

  education to the other, and should never be allowed to drop out 
of our hands. Taste and sympathy require chronological pro- 
gression from the ancient to the modern. The plan of instruc- 
tion must provide for this, by arranging for earliest boyhood a 
beginning in Greek, for the middle stage a beginning in Latin, 
and for the youth the study of modern languages. Speculation 
and empiricism, so far as they are illuminated by it, require 
before all things a systematic and variously applied study of 
- mathematics. I venture to name as most advisable for the 
commencement of these two courses, the Odyssey and the A BC 
of Anschauung. A course of heterogeneous studies may be taken 
as a third series, among which natural history, geography, his- 
torical narratives, and the study of positive law and politics 
are the most important. With these, it is not necessary that 
the earlier shall be finished before the later are begun; only the 
periods must follow each other, since each one in its order has 
a preferential influence on the mind. And each one requires 
such a period, that it may settle firmly and permanently. If 
the exercises described, which must be devoted from time to 
time to the analytical process, be added, the leading features 
of the complete plan of educating instruction are before us, and 
it is only necessary further to add in thought the auxiliary to 
the main studies. The chief studies will be surrounded by 
many auxiliary studies, which mostly fall outside the lessons, 
but not outside the sphere of the influence of a consistent disci- 
pline. For the rest, we may trust that a boy whose interest is 
aroused, will bear the burden which it brings with it. Only 
take care that the interest is not dissipated. Anything which 
disturbs the continuity of the work will inevitably cause this. It 
there among men whom we already know and love, and the growth of whose 
morals and character we have seen in history, to linger awhile, then with 
glad and reverent mind to enter the circle of Christ’s disciples, and after fol- 
lowing him with our eyes and hearts into heaven, return with nobler spirit 
to further pursue the course of the world’s history, to perceive the traces of 
Providence in the slow, solemn, often apparently retrogressive, but yet ever 
advancing progress, and looking far beyond the events of our own time, 
steady our courage and learn to guard our hearts against the manifold de- 
structive influences of the age. 
‘¢ T have proposed thus to study history myself, and I think it possible it 
can be done in my young friend’s company with mutual satisfaction.”

must be so arranged that it carries with it the necessary variety 
in its own province, but it must never degenerate, from love of 
change, into an aimless rhapsody. The most experienced 
teachers appear here to need experience. They do not seem to 
realize the effect of a method of teaching, which follows the 
uniform track of the same interest without a break. Whence 
else comes the broken sequence of lessons in the majority of 
time-tables. It ought to be known that, of all the external 
conditions of a thorough instruction, the first and most indis- 
pensable is, to devote to the same study one lesson daily. But truly 
the number of subjects must have room found for them. | 
There are cases where synthetic instruction cannot be carried 
out to its full extent, and yet one will not give it up altogether. 
Then the task is to condense without at the same time deform- 
ing it. Curtailed uniformly in due proportion, its form the 
same, it will be as if seen through a diminishing glass, showing 
more vivid colours and sharper contrasts, but losing inevitably 
in fulness, contour, and effect. The majority of languages 
should be omitted, translations and extracts should be used, 
where in the other case originals and entire works should be 
read. But the main ideas must be the more insisted on, the 
less their operation can be assisted by a variety of illustration. 
We must forego something in mathematics to exhibit the infi- 
nitely varied interchange between the parts of this science; 
the main principles alone should be given and the most im- 
portant modes of calculation, but these in an encyclopedic 
manner from the lowest to the highest, for the highest are not 
necessarily the most involved. And what is shown should be 
shown fundamentally, and so that it remains a lasting posses- 
sion. In natural history, geography and history, the memory 
should be spared many names, but care taken that the world 
and humanity may appear in luminous outline.! 
In the educational treatment of the sciences we must ar- 
range for similar abbreviations by means of definite selected 
episodes.

In this way many-sidedness of interest may be cultivated, even 
if much internal strength and versatility of expression must be 
given up. 
The plan of study, be it what it may, will be stultified, unless 
the opportunities it provides are utilized. I trust this book 
will be delivered from superficial friends, who fancy they have 
followed its precepts, if they only begin Homer and the A BC 
of Anschauung sufficiently early. I shall not thank them, if 
they do not at the same time give themselves the trouble to 
exhibit the characters of the poets, and to articulate the form 
of things. The vainest of all plans of instruction are probably 
the school schemes sketched out for whole countries and pro- 
vinces, and especially those which a school-board in pleno agrees 
upon, without previously hearing the wishes of the individuals, 
testing the strength and weakness of each one, searching into 
their private relationships one with another, and preparing its 
deliberations accordingly. A good school government needs 
more than a little knowledge of men and politics. For it must 
unite many men, of whom each pair might fairly be described 
as a pair of rivals, if only from zeal for knowledge, in such a 
way that they may work together sincerely to bring their whole 
influence to bear on the scholars. Everything from all sides 
must be used to minimise the touchy points of this rivalry as 
well as to raise the better spirit in these men—-expressly in 
these individuals—and to indicate to each one a beneficent ac- 
tivity suited to him (how much is denied to a learned man if 
he is not permitted to pursue what he likes), so that at last the 
general desire for the proper cultivating effect of each subject 
of instruction shall inspire them all. What does a plan of 
instruction for a whole land know of all this? Such a plan, 
designed without consideration for the individuals who have 
to carry it out in the various districts, does all that it can if 
it avoids rough collisions with the course of studies and with 
the existing spirit of the inhabitants. Therefore it can never 
perform much. I confess I feel no real satisfaction, when 
States apply themselves to educational matters in such a way, 
as if to them, as such—to their government and watchfulness— 
it were possible to entrust what alone can be obtained by the

strenuous efforts of the talent, the faithfulness, the industry, 
the genius, the virtuosoship of individuals, what is created by 
the free activity of those individuals, and is capable of being 
spread by their example. Here it only remains for the govern- 
ment to remove obstacles, to smooth the way, to provide oppor- 
tunities, and to give encouragement, which is still however a 
great and very estimable service to humanity.! 
CHAPTER VI. 
RESULT OF INSTRUCTION. 
A TEACHER has no greater happiness than the frequent know- 
ledge of noble natures, which open and manifest to him un- 
reservedly the wealth of youthful susceptibility. His own 
mind will be kept open, and his efforts unencumbered thereby, 
and he is convinced he possesses, in the idea of the cultivation 
of human beings, the true model for his own work. He is 
untouched by the impressions of want of appreciation which 
mutually put both teacher and pupil out of tune, when the one 
imposes what the other does not wish. He is not misled into 
turning instruction into play, nor on the other hand designedly 
into work; he sees before him a serious business, and tries to 
forward it with gentle but steady hand. He burdens the 
catalogue of the lessons but little with his polyhistory (in 
which everything would be considered but the pupil’s interest 
in the subject) ; he has enough to do in caring that the many- 
sidedness of the teaching shall not be less than the capacity 
which comes out to him. For it is no light thing to lastingly 
satisfy and jill the antroubled youthful mind. 
Filling the mind—this it is, which before all other more 
detailed purposes ought to be the general result of instruction. 
Cultivated humanity continually needs, in its artificial condi- 
tion, art; after comforts are acquired, treasures accumulated,

Mitwirkung, 1810.

  after nature is no longer employed from necessity, energy must 
be given something to do; it must not be allowed to be idle. 
The lazy rich man’s life has aroused the anger of observers in 
all times. ‘“ Crucify the flesh; or backinto the woods.” Such 
speeches will ever be made anew by humanity against itself, 
if it does not learn to prevent the excrescences which, rank as 
ugly, are wont to spring from culture. Impulse must exhaust 
itself in mental efforts; then the mischief is avoided. 
In the hope, then, that there will be no lack of quantity in the 
instruction treated of up to this point, either in breadth or 
strength, we will examine the quality of the condition of mind 
prepared by it. 
I. 
Infe and School. 
Non schole sed vite discendum.1 This wise proverb would 
be somewhat clearer if we knew what it meant by school and 
what by life. 
Perhaps the following short version throws light on it—not 
for ostentation, but for use! Thus rendered, it is a wise economic 
rule, as suitable for the purchase of furniture as of knowledge. 
But life does not merely consist of the use of sundry means 
to various ends. Such a life would be open to the sus- 
y cion of having smothered manifold interest under a few 
aesires. This is certainly not the result of the instruction 
we have in view. And we identify mere utility with life, 
just as little as we identify ostentation with the school. 
Our version then of this proverb is not applicable. Without 
  
1 This saying comes from Seneca, though in another form At the end 
of his third letter to Lucilius, Seneca expresses his opinion that men 
waste their sagacity on useless things, and in so doing are made students, not 
good men; wisdom is a simpler matter, and a good mind does not need so 
much scholarship. He thought, therefore, that men strive after knowledge, 
not that they may become better, but that they may dazzle their fellow 
creatures with it, and he concludes with the sentence: ‘‘ Quemadmodum 
omnium rerum sic literarum quoque intemperantia laboramus; non vite 
sed schole discimus,” i.e. we suffer in knowledge as in all else from want of 
roportion ; we learn not for life, but for the school. The school proposition 
head to be changed into its contrary non schole sed vite discendum,—we 
must learn not for the school, but for life.—Anmerkung von Carl Richter. 
Qo

  194. Science of Education. 
entering into lengthy amendments of the exegesis, let us rather 
ourselves try to explain the relationship between school and life, 
undisturbed if in doing so we again meet the contradiction 
“non scholew, sed vitee.” 
We shall certainly comprehend life most easily, if we ask 
ourselves, how will the known parts of interest probably con- 
tinue to live on with us in future years. 
Empiricism proper—mere observation—finds no end as it seeks 
none; it delights in novelty of which each day brings its own 
supply. Whatever the day brings, part of it always belongs 
to sympathy, for the well-being of men and states is ever 
changing. Thus observation and sympathy are the movements 
by which we make every moment of time our own—through 
which we properly live. When their pulse beats faintly, leisure 
becomes a burden; the bolder spirits then open the door of 
time and seek eternity. 
Speculation and taste are not made for the current of life, for 
change. Change does not put systems only to shame. Every 
individual also, when once his views and taste are formed, gives 
them up unwillingly, and cannot indeed give them up entirely. 
Our principles are too much a work of effort and of years, to 
be easily remoulded when once formed. 
They are the anchor of reflection and personality; observa- 
tion on the contrary, and with it sympathy, gives itself up to 
ever new concentrations. 
Doubtless he who has seen and felt much, has already reached 
with time a certain atmosphere which is beyond the storm of 
the passions. The new is trivial compared with that already 
felt. But this atmosphere is not rest, not mastery, it is only a 
less yielding mobility. 
With those of the world’s better ones, who are less accustomed 
to thought, religion almost entirely guides the rudder of life ; it 
takes the place at once of speculation and of taste. All require 
religion for mental rest, but the activities of the mind subject 
those who have culture for it to a double discipline, z.e. of 
theoretical and practical judgment. 
Observation which would endlessly collect and lose one thing 
in another, and finally itself in all—Sympathy which in the 
 
-P-A-G-E-215

fervour of its claims would penetrate activity everywhere, and 
in so doing be exposed to deathly chills—both of these, specu- 
lation is fitted to keep moderate and cool because it quits 
change to rise into being—yet still more, because looking back 
from the immaterial, it defines and limits the general possibility 
of the material, and again uniting itself with experience warns 
those who do not reflect on space and time and the whole vast 
course of forces, against all hastiness, over-estimation, exag- 
gerated hopes and fears, against all mistakes and petty clever- 
ness. 
To worthily employ the developed power which, through the 
accumulation of knowledge, waits within the bounds of reflec- 
tion till its guide appears, Taste! has its models and its ideas. 
The proper, the beautiful, the moral, the right, in one word, 
that which in its perfect state pleases after perfect contemplation— 
to show this would be the happy work of the purely reflective 
life, if previous effort were not necessary to remove the unpleas- 
ing, the burdensome accumulations which lie heaped up all 
around, where unreflecting men have acted from impulse. 
Taste is strict, and retracts nothing. Life must be ruled 
according to the laws of Taste, or it sinks under its reproaches. 
To completely teach how life is determined by its two rulers, 
Speculation and Taste, we must search for a system of philosophy, 
the keystone of instruction. 
Melancholy is it, to witness how our philosophy up to the 
present time, has so often confounded the opposite and com- 
pletely independent nature of the two—has misused taste in the 
name of speculation, or speculation in the name of taste; 
melancholy to see how it has oppressed through both the spirit 
of observation and sympathy, and so injured life itself; melan- 
choly to see the convulsive struggles under which youths, often 
of ability, swaying hither and thither unprepared between the 
universal and the ego, of which one is too broad, and both are 
too deep, despairing and almost lost, glory in the acquired 
insight, that everything is nothing. Nothing is more shocking

Zésthetic Revelation of the World.

  to the feeling of the teacher, than the carelessness by which the 
result of careful instruction is so often thrown into the whirl- 
pool of the age’s speculative adventures, and exposed to its 
doubtful consequences. Useless laments over it here are not 
for me, still the science of education must point out the dan- 
gerous spot.! 
The course of the human race certainly requires, that those 
who are fit should venture themselves in order to seek the 
anchor of reflection, and must seek until they find it. 
It is possible, that individuals in the obscure simplicity of 
Nature can live on for themselves happily enough. Where the 
waves of life do not run high, it does not need much power to 
keep oneself afloat. 
But we in the midst of a system of civilised States, with 
interest for humanity and society, are driven through this 
interest to search for a unity of thought, which may form the 
meeting-place of the general reflection gathered from the in- 
numerable concentrations, in which the many dissipate them- 
selves. Solon’s old reproof to the Athenians, “ Individuals 
have understanding, but combined they have none,” points to 
a need of humanity from time immemorial—namely the sources 
of a common understanding. 
All concentrations should be gathered together, co-ordinated, 
in reflection, and the ever new life should ever create the school anew. 
This does really take place in periods when there are intellec- 
tual men, who understand how to take care of the fruits of life. 
We do not complain that till now diverse schools have been 
created, we remember rather the short periods and small powers 
which have hitherto been devoted to them. 
Let us now translate more truly than before the term 
“school,” and give to the noble word its true signification: 
school® is leiswre, and leisure is the common property of specula- 
tion, taste and religion. Life is a participation of the sympa- 
ee ne

word cxod7 (leisure, and later, school). Aristotle in his Ethics, insists

thetic observer in the alternations of external action and endur- 
ance. The hard proverb which seems to make change the object 
of leisure, and reflection into a means for concentrations, is not 
inexorable, and permits us to move hither and thither from one 
to the other, and to use the transition from doing and enduring 
to leisure, and again from leisure to doing and enduring, as the 
breathing of the human mind, as the need and as the charac- 
teristic of health. 
So much for the kind of mental condition which many-sided 
interest endeavours to prepare, as far as the knowledge of the 
age allows. The joy of life is combined in it, with the elevation 
of soul which knows how to part from life. 
II. 
Glance at the end of the educational period of Youth. 
Just at that period when natural activity has reached its 
highest tension, and is most at the service of the extension of 
interest, the particular points come more prominently into 
view, fastened upon which, the mental vision contracts itself 
more and more. These points themselves do not interest us, 
but only their general results. 
Every human being has to act, and the youth dreams of his 
actions. So he does also of the means and ways, hindrances and 
dangers—of those certainly, be they great or small, which hang 
together with his actions. That which is useful and harmful 
thus becomes interesting to him, and that indifferent which 
does not touch this sphere. Human beings, objects, and know- 
ledge are sifted. The realities of life rise, learning sinks. 
The old languages die, the dead ones give place to the living. 
Taste and enquiry seek the heights of the age, that they may 
be at home with contemporaries. Instead of sympathy, love 
arises, and the good wishes for society seek a vocation. Now 
come well-wishers, and enviers, and double dealers; the young 
man must watch, be considerate, win, circumvent, dazzle, 
  strongly on the value of leisure as an indispensable condition of contem- 
plation (@ewpia), the highest activity of man. Doubtless Herbart had this 
passage in his mind. 
 
-P-A-G-E-218
   
      Science of Education.    frighten, flatter; and with so many interests, many-sidedness is 
amply provided for, 
It is but natural that the teacher should witness this im- 
poverishment of spirit with sorrow. It would however, be a 
cause of shame to the friend of education, if his serious purpose 
could ever have been to prevent this impoverishment by pre- 
existing poverty. 
The evil will not be so great as this, and a well-grounded, 
genuine, many-sided interest, cultivated by a persevering and 
forcible instruction, will withstand the contraction—will itself 
give its vote on the plan of life, itself choose and reject ways 
and means, open out prospects, win friends, put the envious 
to shame ; it will step forth in action through the mere mani- 
festation of a sterling personality, and beyond this also, through 
the wealth of so many capacities which, if necessary, could soon 
become attainments. Crude impulses will thereby be brought 
back into bounds, through which they can break no more. 
On the direction which this development takes, depends 
who the future man will be. At this point, what the man 
wills, and wills not, separates itself, and then the estimate he 
forms of himself is expressed. The inward code of honour be- 
comes determined. Intercourse becomes defined, and out of 
close connection with persons whose esteem he desires to win, 
proceeds a kind of obligation to deserve it. Here all influences 
come into play. Whatthe youth till now has learned, thought, 
practised, is instrumental in pointing out to him his place 
among men, and in himself, and thus all blends and becomes 
one. What he wishes, loves, acknowledges, despises, disposes 
itself in due order, while conjointly determining his views and 
plan of life. The consequences of this continue, running straight 
on through life. He who allows himself to be urged into a 
career of public activity will hardly put much of his own mind 
into his business ; the favourite amusement separates itself from 
duty to the detriment of both. He whose path is marked out 
by egoism, looks henceforth on men and things in the inverse 
relation of their distance to himself. Whatever is conceded 
to sympathy in the choice of a future career, and whatever con- 
sideration is vouchsafed to the care of individual cultivation,
-P-A-G-E-219
  Many-Sidedness of Interest. 199 
is secured to them both, though not necessarily in actual practice, 
yet in the will, the personality, provided the youth has learned 
to withstand infirmity of purpose. 
We see here the result of instruction in contact with the - 
result of the formation of character. It will be tolerably clear, 
that with the growth of genuine many-sided instruction, the 
adjustment of character is duly provided for. Its firmness, 
decision, and invulnerability is, however, something entirely dif- 
ferent. 
To explain these to ourselves as satisfactorily as is possible, 
without the definite presupposition of psychology and practical 
philosophy, we must first go back to a development of concepts 
similar to those with which the present book commenced.

MORAL STRENGTH OF CHARACTER. 
CHAPTER I. 
WHAT IS TO BE UNDERSTOOD BY CHARACTER P 
In the foregoing we considered the will as the seat of character, 
naturally not the changeable wishes and moods of the will, 
but its uniformity and firmness, that whereby it is determinately 
this and no other. That kind of the determination we called 
character—that which a man wills as compared with that which he 
wilis not. 
In such a comparison the form of. each thing is determined. 
It is removed from an indeterminate, larger sphere; it is per- 
ceived through differentiation. Accordingly character is the 
embodiment of the will. It can only be comprehended in the 
contrast between that which it purposes, and that which it 
excludes. 
In the negative part of character we have to distinguish the 
deficient will from the denying will. A deficient will, which 
however may develop, would belong to the indeterminate facul- 
ties of man. Only what is already excluded thereby as incon- 
sistent with the rare positive will, is quite as characteristic as 
express not-willing. Yet the latter serves to strengthen. 
We observe human nature in order to know what we have 
in it, to fix it as an object. A man himself feels the same need. 
In order to be conceived, he must be conceivable. This leads us 
to a remarkable distinction.

I. 
Objective and Subjective Parts of Character. 
Tt is an old complaint that man has often, as it were, two 
souls. 
He observes himself, would understand himself, would please 
and guide himself. But, previous to this observation, while 
immersed in things and externals, he has a will,’ and often very 
marked features of character. These are the objective with 
which the contemplating subjective either agrees or disagrees 
by means of a new will, created in an entirely different con- 
dition of mind and soul (Gemiithslage). 
In case of disagreement, which of the two wills determines 
the character? It is quite clear, that that, which combined 
would have strengthened it, now chafes and disintegrates it; 
that the better claims on us, if they only prevent a fall into the 
distinctly bad, can but preserve at best a salutary absence of 
character. 
If one of the two parts of the character be weak, the earlier 
determination of the one can then effect much over the other. 
This we find corroborated in many wild but uncorrupted youths 
who very soon acquire considerable moral strength through 
the influence of an old friend or of healthful literature. It is 
less happily confirmed in those cases where by much early 
moral teaching and quickening—even of the purest kind—an 
endeavour is made to anticipate all the perverse traits of 
character which burst out from within. For although this 
influence acts powerfully, still it cannot ensure that in the long 
course of the approaching period of education, hidden impulses 
will not shoot up here and there amongst the good teaching, 
and thus at times cause strange anomalies. Nevertheless, if 
moral teaching is to act directly on human nature, there is 
nothing left for it but to turn to the subjective of the person- 
1 Herbart in his Umriss piidagogischer Vorlesungen defines the Objective 
part of character as that part of the will, which the individual finds already 
existent, when he begins to observe himself; and the Subjective part, as the 
new will which arises in and with this self-observation. 
   
-P-A-G-E-222

  ality, in order that this may test itself with the objective basis, 
and see what it can accomplish. 
On the other hand, such a method is not suitable for educa- 
tion. The ordinary and natural phenomenon—that men invent 
the maxims ! for their inclinations afterwards, in order to enjoy 
the convenience of an inward prescriptive right to do as they 
like, must direct education to devote its chief attention to the 
objective part of the character, which forms and raises itself 
slowly enough under its observation and influence. If this 
first is in order, results may then be hoped for from the regula- 
ting power of good moral teaching. There will still remain 
to the subjective to give the sanction, the final settlement and 
refinement of the morally formed character, which it will, 
however, easily accomplish. 
Il, 
Memory of the Will.? Choice. 
Principle. Conflict. 
There is an endowment tending to stability of character, 
which is noticeable in some instances quite early, and which 
I know not better how to express than by the term—Memory 
of the Will. 
Tavoid here all psychological development of the phenomena, 
stamped with the names of memory, power of recollection, etc., 
as if they presupposed a particular activity or even power of 
the mind. I am astonished, meanwhile, that a parallel has not 
been more carefully drawn between the constancy of our con- 
ceptions, and the constancy of willing which goes to make up 
the chief basis of the objective part of character. 
So much is certain, that a man whose will does not, like ideas 
held in the memory, spontaneously re-appear as the same as 
often as the occasion recurs—a man who is obliged to carry 
1 Maxim, in Herbart’s technology, is a collective term for a number of 
judgments passed on similar cases, which are subsequently rejudged (beur- 
theilt), and formed by the act of rejudgment into a practical principle of 
conduct.

himself back by reflection to his former resolution—will have 
great trouble in building up his character. And it is because 
natural constancy of will is not often found in children, that 
discipline has so much to do. 
We here point out only the condition of this constancy, 
namely, a uniform will and adequate survey of the sphere of 
the presentations out of which the will proceeds. Whoever 
has not, in the very beginning, co-ordinated the considerations | 
which lie at the foundation of will, and does not further con- | 
tinue to co-ordinate them, must certainly always be of unstable 
character ; and upon this the environment has much influence. 
That which is willed with constancy—whether the object 
of will be purposed or excluded—constitutes the basis of the 
objective in character. But this basis is manifold, and every- 
thing is not willed with equal firmness and strength. The 
degrees of firmness are determined by choice. Choice is pre- 
ference and rejection. For him who carries this out consistently, 
each thing has a limited value, and nothing except the highest 
can fill the mind with illimitable endeavour. The inclinations 
have a firm construction, and it is through the various quanti- 
tative relationships in this construction that characters differ- 
entiate themselves; otherwise men have on the whole much 
the same inclinations. It is clear, moreover, that this estimate 
can only be made according to the individual standpoint. But 
it must be made, that the character may consolidate itself. We 
must know how dear our wishes cost us. The trivial must 
separate itself—must fall to the ground before the greater, the 
more important. 
When there is memory of the will, choice will decide by 
itself. The weight of the wishes will involuntarily place them 
in their relative order. Without any theoretical consideration 
(for only by initiative choice can the connected motives receive 
further practical importance) the man becomes conscious of what 
he prefers, and what he will rather sacrifice, what he dislikes, 
more and what less; he experiences it in himself. A changeable 
mind, however, never obtains herein perfect experience. 
When the mind, as intelligence, approaches and considers 
itself and the objects of its willing, itis then a question how   
   
-P-A-G-E-224

204 Science of Education. 
pure the subjective of the personality can keep itself from the 
objective. A sincere taste will pass judgment on the self as 
impartially as on a stranger; the subjective part of the 
character at least will be morally pure, and remain so, in spite 
of all want of harmony with the objective. But the man who 
contemplates himself, generally seeks only to express himself; 
and here, where character specially is being spoken of, we can 
leave out of consideration how far this self-expression may pos- 
sibly deviate from the normal moral standard. 
The endeavour to comprehend oneself acts directly as an 
endeavour to strengthen oneself, for the firmer elements are 
thereby brought out still more in consciousness beyond the less 
firm. A man easily arrives thereby at some kind of unity with 
himself. This gives rise to a feeling of happiness, which is 
powerful enough to make itself master of the inner monitor. 
Thus the most prominent features of the objective raise them- 
selves into principles in the subjective of the character, and 
the ruling inclinations are thus legalized. 
But this self-contemplation by which principles are de- 
veloped, performs yet another service for inner stability. An 
individual can only comprehend himself together with his 
environment, and his inclinations only with their objects. If 
there be some power of theoretic thought, there also attaches 
to the principles the consideration of the variability of the 
circumstances, according to which their use must be decided. 
Man learns to determine himself according to motives; he 
learns to listen to reasons, that is to say, he learns to subsume the 
subordinate principles which time provides, to his adopted main 
principles, on each occasion, and only then to put in action the 
decisions thus formed. I call this quality of the character force of 
motive, which must be directly bound up with firmness of principle. 
But the objective of the personality can never be wholly 
and fully enclosed in the principles. Each personality is and 
remains a chameleon, and as a consequence every character 
will often be found in a state of inward conflict. In such 
conflict the strength of the man shines forth, and perhaps his 
virtue ; but there is danger to mental, and in the end, to bodily 
health also. On this account there is reason for wishing the
-P-A-G-E-225

struggle at an end. But a spurious morality, which teaches 
that man should not struggle, has no power to root out such 
struggles; amelioration of them must be looked for from the 
preventive measures of education. 
  
CHAPTER II. 
ON THE NOTION OF MORALITY. 
THE preceding remarks relating to character were a specifica- 
tion of psychological phenomena. But every one who thought- 
fully considers the word morality will acknowledge it is not 
satisfactory merely to have any kind of character. 
It is taken for granted, then, that certain claims lie at the 
basis of morality as against any given character—claims which 
cannot be compelled to resign their rights by the opposition 
which in fact awaits them, although they do not possess an 
intrinsic power to accomplish anything. And these claims have 
- nothing in common with the real, the natural, even with that 
which 7s in any sense, but come to them as something totally 
strange, and come in contact with them only to judge them. 
And a judging power does not engage in strife with the object 
upon which it pronounces sentence. 
But a character which does not submit to a first judgment 
may thereby draw upon itself a new one. The disapproval in 
this judgment may ultimately become unbearable to men, and 
thus the resolution may possibly at last be formed to obey these 
claims as commands. Every one knows that all men feel them- 
selves impelled in this direction, and that they are wont, more 
or less, to move thither.! 
But does any one know at once how to reproduce in one 
sentence what the first judgment truly affirms? The doctrines 
of law and morality are not alike, although each speaks in the 
name of all. 
I drew certain conclusions from this in my treatise On the 
Listhetic Revelation of the World, which really, however, have 
a meaning only for those who are able to emerge, at least for a 
1 Aisthetische Darstellung der Welt, p. 65. 
 
-P-A-G-E-226
206 Science of Education. 
  moment, from the contradiction of attempting to force defini- 
tions out of their own opinions, into the objective and generally 
obligatory concept of morality. 
No one will expect that the science of education will antici- 
pate the explanations and confirmations which can be given by 
practical philosophy alone. For this reason therefore, I can 
only here ask the acceptance of an historical knowledge of some 
modes of presentation, which are unavoidably interwoven with 
the exposition of my principles of education. 
I, 
The Positive and Negative Sides of Morality. 
However much humility there may be in morality, the virtue 
shown in its exercise is called by every one strength, by no one 
weakness. 
Nevertheless, the exercise of morality would only be weak- 
ness if it were merely compliance with claims from without. 
Do we not rather say to ourselves concerning those claims— 
we ourselves pronounce against ourselves in that we judge our 
character and demand obediencer This is the contemplative 
Subject in us, which has raised itself for the time being over the 
mere self-expression of the inner state. 
Both sides of morality, the positive and negative, lie here in 
close proximity. The act of judging itself is positive, but the 
tenor of the judgment is negative for the character, which as 
shown based on the objectivity of the personality, is not in 
harmony with its claims. And the negativing judgment trans- 
forms itself into a real elevation and self-sacrifice, so far as the 
personality determines to obey. It then accepts as a categori- 
cal imperative what in itself was a simple judgment. 
It was certainly a mistake to begin ethics scientifically with 
this categorical imperative. The purely positive must here take 
precedence, and many things be unfolded in their relation and 
sequence which Kant had not thoroughly thought out. But they 
who forget themselves so far as to desire the release of mankind 
from the categorical imperative, make a still graver mistake.’

  IT. 
Moral. 
Judgment. Warmth. 
Decision. Self-restraint. 
A moral feeling is recognized and indeed found at an early 
age in children. Practical reason too is spoken of, indicating 
that the original expression of the moral is not to be left to 
a changeable obscure feeling, nor to an activity and emotion 
of the mind (Gemiith); on the contrary, the very natural 
demand is made that expressions of such authority should be 
sober authoritative declarations, wherein the object, as well as 
the judgment given concerning it, shall be quite plainly and 
emphatically expressed. In giving over on such good grounds 
to reason the expression of the first fundamental determinations 
of morality, we do not notice, however, that we are delivered 
into the hands of a theoretical artist, who, carried away by 
logic and metaphysics, defines the moral law by virtue of its 
universality, and makes freedom the source of goodness. 
This theoretical artist (reason) will rather summon the whole 
transcendental philosophy to explain the possibility of the 
moral consciousness, than lead us in a single point of our moral 
feeling to the clear reflection, that we know and feel how to 
separate from extraneous matters what we really choose and 
reject, when we use the expressions of moral approval and dis- 
approval. Perhaps a prepossession in favour of the term taste 
(Geschmack) will not be so very difficult to win from those of 
my contemporaries who, notwithstanding this mistake, have 
become conscious meanwhile, that a moral decision is in itself 
neither a feeling nor a theoretical truth, especially when I assure 
them that what I call moral taste has nothing in common with 
the fashionable talk of the present day, and moreover is just as 
far from confusing the good with the beautiful after the manner 
of the Stoic maxim—6éru povoy ayabdv 7d Kaddv.? 
1 Translators’ Introduction, p. 25. 
2 «Only the beautiful is good.” The chief ethical principle of the Stoics 
was to obey Nature. According to them, the natural is the appropriate, and 
the appropriate in its completion is the good. 
 
-P-A-G-E-228
  208 Science of Education. 
By whatever name, however, moral judgment may be called, 
a sober, clear, firm, and determinate judgment must in any 
case form the foundation of the moral in man, unless in the 
place of moral warmth, a hasty impulsiveness or a morbid crav- 
ing be put, both of which consider the good as an object of 
desire, and of which the one is as useless as the other for the 
purpose of timely and judicious activity. The individual finds 
in himself many occasions for moral judgment which must be 
met face to face honestly and courageously. Only out of the 
number and variety of these occasions, of which such an in- 
exhaustible supply is offered in the family, in general inter- 
course, and in all which falls within the sphere of synthetical 
and analytical education—only out of this wealth, which is 
moreover capable of an ordered and impressive representation, 
and if I may be allowed a bold expression, of a poetical com- 
position—in short, only out of the wsthetic power of the moral 
view, can the pure non-sensual emotion (which can be com- 
bined with courage and wisdom) proceed, whereby character 
is strengthened to true morality. 
For the conceptions of the good and right must indeed come 
to an agreement in the objective of the character with the 
further conceptions of taste and of wisdom, and by the sheer 
force of their clearness take that precedence in the general 
choice, which is due to them before all other emotions of desire. 
But they must also pass out into the subjective of the char- 
acter; they must express themselves as principles. The moral 
determination, however, which introduces the negative side of 
morality, is, it is true, always liable to be disobeyed, and is 
consequently exposed to depression, since it is very rare that 
a human nature finds itself again wholly dominated by that 
determination. Nevertheless, the depression will not overthrow 
the determination, if enduring warmth be present, and if educa- 
tion has been careful not to engraft moral teaching on fleeting 
emotions. 
Self-observation must however be added to determination 
as a subsumption to the main principles. In this, much depends 
on aright comprehension of one’s own individuality; he who 
judges himself wrongly is in danger of disintegration. Hvery-
-P-A-G-E-229

thing else too, which belongs to the motivity of character 
generally, must be made dependent upon the motive power of 
the moral principles, and exercise a reflex influence upon their 
use. The individual must contemplate his whole position in 
the world from a moral point of view; he must tell himself 
how his highest interest can be favoured or harmed by circum- 
stances. He must reinforce the practical view with the 
theoretical; he must act accordingly. I indicated this in 
another place by the expression—pragmatical composition of 
the moral order of life.! 
Self-constraint forms the conclusion. The man learns 
thereby who he is, and whatever weaknesses have betrayed 
themselves here, tleir origin must be tracked and sought out 
through all the depths of the individuality. 
  
CHAPTER III. 
IN WHAT WAY DOES MORAL CHARACTER REVEAL ITSELP. 
THe conceptions hitherto developed are entirely formal; the 
point now is to find for them the real—to determine to what 
the moral character is decided, whereby and wherefore it shows 
its firmness. 
I, 
Character as ruling the Desires and in the service of the Ideas. 
Moral decision clearly lies between that which it determines, 
and that by which it suffers itself to be determined. Desire— 
i.e., all that which belongs to the so-called lower appetitive 
faculty—will be bounded, arranged, and firmly held in the scale 
once chosen; from that on the contrary which the involuntary 
judgment cannot help marking in an unqualified manner with 
approval or disapproval, the will takes law, the principle of 
order, and the objects of its endeavours.” That which was 
marked with involuntary approbation, I call a practical idea.®

  210 Science of Education. 
  If we would therefore see the formal conceptions of character 
and of moral character realised, we must search for the chief 
parts of that which is determinable in the lower appetitive 
taculty, as well as of that which falls within the province of 
determining ideas, in order to become acquainted with the 
matter, and the forming nature of moral character.

The lower appetitive faculty is based upon the feelings of 
desire and dislike. A man of character bears the dislikes in 
part, the residue he fends off; he knows what he will suffer and 
what he will not suffer; he has expelled the restlessness of 
impatience. His desires he has also curbed—the desire attached 
to things which he wishes to own in order to be sure of them, 
as well as those which appertain to personal activity and 
productiveness in employment. The ideas I take from practical 
philosophy. Out of the series which it offers me, I pass over one 
which is merely formal, that of Perfection ; two others! which 
are strictly separatied there, I combine in one expression— 
Rectitude. I cannot give here either the reasons why, or the 
specific differences of the ideas themselves; for the purposes 
of the general science of education, the known names will be 
easily, rightly, and sufficiently understood. But should this 
part of the science be carried out in detail, this license must 
be given up. 
  
CHAPTER IV. 
THE NATURAL COURSE OF FORMATION OF CHARACTER. 
WHEN certain movements which we would guide have already 
begun to take place before our eyes, it may be taken for granted, 
1 The ideas of Right (Recht) and Equity (Billigkeit) are here combined in 
the term Rechtlichkeit (Rectitude), i,c. conformity to a moral standard. 
   
-P-A-G-E-231
  Moral Strength of Character. 21k 
  as a primary rule of wisdom, that we must first try and 
understand the change begun, before we interfere in our own 
way. 
It forced itself on our notice, that we could not treat of 
instruction without making a connecting reference to those 
constant teachers of men—experience and intercourse. Here, 
where we have to state the means of discipline for the forma- 
tion of character, we are still more forcibly impressed with the 
necessity for a preliminary enquiry into the course usually 
taken by natures left to themselves in the gradual formation of 
their character. For we know that men formed from any but 
the very softest clay, do not wait for the character which the 
teacher wishes to give them. How often in this respect are 
labour and anxiety thrown away, in the effort to produce what 
is self-formed, and in the end must be taken, when completed, 
as it is found. 
2 
Action is the Principle of Character. 
The elements of character and its seat when existent have 
been already shown. The will is its seat; the kind of the 
decision of the will, determines the species of the character. 
The question what the character will be, will therefore be 
answered when we show how the will arrives at decision. 
Let us first enquire, what would a will be without decision P 
Scarcely a will at all—an emotion without determination, a 
mere self-inclination to an object, without the assumption that 
it will be reached—call it what you like, either a desire or a lust. 
Whoever says then—I will, has already conquered for him- 
self the future in thought. He already sees himself achieving, 
possessing, enjoying. 
Show him that he cannot, he will then desist, for he under- 
stands you. Perhaps, however, the desire will remain and 
rage violently, or make covert attempts. There is again a 
new volition in these attempts, not now directed towards the 
object, but towards the movements which are made with the

consciousness of mastery over them, and with the hope that 
by means of their skilful combination the object will be 
attained. The commander-in-chief desires to conquer. There- 
fore he wills the manceuvres of his troops. He would not 
will these if he were not acquainted with the power of his 
commands. But a desire may exist in some individual (this 
example is from Jacobi), a desire to will to dance, as a Vestris 
can will to dance. Desire so to will may be present in many, 
and doubtless the education of the master began with the 
desire, yet his act of volition could certainly not hasten the 
| gradual accomplishment by one single step, but at the most 
| follow at its heels. 
Action therefore generates the will out of desire. 
But capacity and opportunity are necessary to action. 
From this point we can survey the elements collected, which 
are necessary for the formation of character. 
It is obvious that man’s activity depends in the first instance 
on the circle of his desires. The desires, however, are partly 
sensual, and partly spring from intellectual interests. 
The individual capacities come secondly, together with the 
external opportunities and impediments. Their influence is 
the more complicated in proportion as the means required for a 
certain object are greater, and the more numerous the activities 
are, which can be furthered or hindered from without and within. 
Before all things we must take into consideration in this, 
that the greater part of an educated man’s activity only takes 
place inwardly, and that we chiefly learn our ability from 
inward experiences. ‘T'he primary essential from which char- 
acter receives its bent, depends on the direction in which we 
do, or do not, possess the motive and pliancy to guide our 
thoughts. For it depends upon which kind of external 
activity in all its complications the imagination succeeds in 
picturing with vivid clearness. The great man acted long 
before in thought—he felt himself acting, he saw himself 
advancing—before the external act, the fac-simile of the 
internal, became visible. A few passing attempts in per- 
formance proving in reality nothing, suffice to change a 
flattering faith into confidence, that he will be able to realise   
 
-P-A-G-E-233

  in act, what he sees with inward clearness. In order to create 
a firm volition, this courage supplies the place of the act. 
Unhappy are they who are wanting in power when they 
will something great. The path of destruction is the course 
of education reversed. Dejection which becomes habitual is 
consumption of the character. 
Ad 
Influence of the Circle of Thought on Character. 
Ignoti nulla cupido !—The circle of thought contains the store 
of that which by degrees can mount by the steps of interest 
to desire, and then by means of action to volition. Further, it 
contains the store upon which all the workings of prudence are 
founded—in it are the knowledge and care, without which man 
cannot pursue his aims through means. The whole inner acti- 
vity, indeed, has its abode in the circle of thought. Here is 
found the initiative life, the primal energy ; here all must cir- 
culate easily and freely, everything must be in its place ready 
to be found and used at any moment; nothing must lie in the 
way, and nothing like a heavy load impede useful activity. 
Clearness, association, system and method must rule here. 
Courage will then be sustained by the certainty of the inner 
performance, and rightly so, for the external impediments which 
unexpectedly appear to the foresight of a careful intelligence, 
can terrify him but little, who knows that, with altered circum- 
stances, he can at once evolve new plans. 
If this inner assurance of a sufficiently yet readily armed in- 
telligence coexists with a mere egoistic interest, the character 
is soon determined, and certainly spoiled. Everything therefore 
that appertains to sympathy must be cultivated up to the level 
of demand and action.' 
If, on the contrary, all the intellectual interests are awake 
and alive to these claims, it will easily happen that the means 
will not be sufficient for the many aims; the excessive activity 
does not attain much, possibly suffers depression ; and the char- 
1 Demand and action, or Fordern und Handeln. See page 180.

  214 Science of Education. 
acter will remain stunted. These cases are rare, and assistance 
is not difficult. 
If inner assurance and the intellectual interests are wanting, 
if the store of thought be meagre, then the ground lies empty 
for the animal desires ; something of an abortion, which looks 
like the caricature of a character, will be at last the outcome of 
this also. 
The limits of the circle of thought are the limits for the 
character, although not the limits of the character. For the 
whole circle of thought is not by any means realized in action. 
Nevertheless, the residue left to itself in the depths of the mind 
(Gemiith) is important for the tender parts of character. Cir- 
cumstances can excite it; therefore instruction cannot by any 
means afford to neglect what it cannot perfectly carry out. It 
can at least help to determine the sensitiveness ; it can increase 
and improve susceptibility for future impressions. 
Thus far we have treated of the objective part of character. 
If false opinions, as imperfect presuppositions upon which it 
builds, are pernicious to it (the objective), all prejudices are far 
more damaging to the subjective—to the self-criticism and self- 
approval—which, as the first principle, holds fast to what is 
right, permissible, becoming, judicious. We scarcely know one 
great character whom we do not see entangled in his own pre- 
judices. Doing violence to them means attacking the principles 
at their roots; it means sowing dissension between the sub- 
jective and objective; it means robbing a man of his unity 
with himself, and setting him at discord with himself. Those 
who adhere to old prejudices have truly good reason not to 
give themselves to new fancies; and, on the other hand, no 
greater sacrifice can be made for the truth, than by the ac- 
knowledgment of errors on which a personality supported itself, 
Such a sacrifice deserves great respect, but at the same time 
commiseration. 
Whoever will continue for himself the reflections here begun, 
in which we may not wander too far, will with difficulty avoid 
the firm conviction, that in the culture of the circle of thought 
the main part of education lies But let him then compare

  the ordinary school rubbish and the circle of thought which 
is to be expected from it. Let him consider if it be wise to 
treat instruction again and again as a presentation of memo- 
randa, and to leave to discipline alone the task of making men 
of those who bear the human form. Many, prematurely wearied 
with these considerations, will surely throw themselves upon 
the indolent bed of freedom, even if not on that of fate. To 
such I have here absolutely nothing to say. And if the bed 
of thorns upon which they throw themselves does not compel 
them to start up, then their peace will not be easily disturbed 
by mere disputation. 
TIT. 
Influence of Innate Disposition (Anlage) upon Character. 
Innate disposition and opportunity are the powers which 
concur with the desires when they issue as activity. But 
before we consider them more closely, a remark may be offered 
in connection with the preceding, concerning the educational 
importance of the object of our further search. The faculties 
(Anlagen) develop themselves slowly, they do not ripen till 
manhood; and not till then does the proper opportunity for 
external action come, by which the inner activity first receives 
its proper tension. As, however, it is action which forms the 
character, only that which struggles inwardly towards action 
is essentially existent in the early years—the liquid substance, 
as it were, out of which the character will hereafter crystallize 
itself only too quickly. Just when the character thus finds and 
takes permanent form, consequently at the beginning of man- 
hood upon entrance into the world, the important question is 
what dispositions and what opportunities concur with the pre- 
viously accumulated desires? But education is then finished, its 
time passed by, the receptiity for it exhausted, and its work, we 
must acknowledge, is partly left to chance, against which only 
a perfectly balanced cultivation of the subjective and objective 
in the personality offers some degree of safety. For that very 
reason, almost the whole of the intended formation of character 
consists in the effect on the circle of thought, which the man 
 
-P-A-G-E-236
  216 Science of Education. 
  brings with him into the period when the world is all before 
him, and ripe bodily powers are at his service, although that 
effect influences but one factor of the character. 
In regard, however, to the innate disposition, the most im- 
portant difference does not consist, extraordinary cases excepted, 
in that to which the man shows inclination and facility, but 
rather in a formal peculiarity which varies in degrees with 
individuals — namely, whether the mind (Gemiithslage) can 
change its attitude with ease or difficulty. The slow-minded, 
provided they are clear-minded also, possess the most excellent 
innate disposition (Anlage), only they need very careful in- 
struction. The quick-minded are easier to teach, indeed they 
help themselves to what they seek; but they require disci- 
pline even beyond the period of education, and are therefore 
exposed to chance, and hardly ever attain to so solid a person- 
ality as the former. 
It is clear, then, that the primary requisite of character— 
memory of the will'—stands in closest connection with the 
degree of the mind’s mobility. No kinds of men are more want- 
ing in character than those who, according to their moods, look 
at the same thing now as black, now as white; or those who, 
to advance with the times, change their opinion according to 
fashion. Similar frivolousness is found in children, who ask 
one question after another without waiting for an answer, and 
have every day new games and playfellows; in youths, again, 
who learn a new instrument every month, and begin one lan- 
guage after another. Finally, this trait is found in young men, 
who listen to-day to half a dozen lecturers, to-morrow study by 
themselves, and the next day set out on their travels. These 
last are beyond discipline; the former it may still help; those, 
however, are most worth education, who cling to the known, and 
are disinclined for the new, merely as new; who keep cool 
towards everything which merely dazzles by its brilliancy, and 
live in their own world, hold, pursue, cultivate their own 
objects, are difficult to move from their track, and often appear 
stubborn and stupid without being either one or the other; 
  * Translators’ Introduction, p. 38,
-P-A-G-E-237
  Moral Strength of Character. 217 
who at first tolerate a teacher unwillingly, meet him coldly, 
and do not in the slightest degree ingratiate themselves with 
him. These individuals who most need education, who, when 
left to themselves, stick to one spot, who are condemned through 
their tenacity to a certain one-sidedness,-and may even be 
inclined to the moral perversity of family pride, of tribal or 
caste spirit—it is in these that it is worth while to arouse 
interest of all kinds, who in their healthy will, after it is once 
won, afford education a sound footing.t For them the teacher 
may indeed hope they will loyally guard the purity and recti- 
tude of their well-trained minds, when at last the final and most 
important steps in the formation of character are taken under 
conditions, not prepared by a guiding discipline, but brought 
about by the fluctuations of a stormy world. No one I hope 
will fear that such strong natures would oppose too strong a 
resistance to the pliant power of education. This will certainly 
be the case, if we meet them first as youths, and do not find 
many points of contact with them; but a boy who is stronger 
than a sound instruction, a consistently carried out government 
and a wise discipline,—such a boy is a monster. 
The difference in the dispositions (Anlagen), which deter- 
mines what the individual compasses with greater or less 
facility, must certainly be taken into consideration. For what 
is successful will be willingly undertaken and often repeated ; 
and if it cannot become an aim, it can at least serve as a means. 
It works consequently as a force to forward other aims, and to 
strengthen the bent of the mind in that direction. Neverthe- 
less that high degree of success of individual activities, which 
characterises a special genius, is in no way favourable to the 
formation of character. For genius depends too much on vary- 
ing moods to permit of memory of the will; it is not at its own 
command, The moods of the artist do not constitute character. 
Besides, an artist’s occupations lie always in far too remote a 
corner of human life and creation, to permit of the whole man 
  i This is one of the many instances of generalisations made by Herbart 
from his experience with his Swiss pupils. In this case he generalises from 
his favourite pupil, Karl von Steiger. 
 
-P-A-G-E-238
  218 Science of Education. 
  ruling himself therefrom. Yes, even in the whole realm of the 
sciences there is no single one which is capable by itself alone 
of carrying its devotee along the stream of life. 
Only a universal genius, if such were possible, is to be desired. 
With special abnormities which Nature has allowed in the dis- 
position, education ought never to make common cause, or the 
human being becomes disintegrated. Under the name of modest 
tastes, exquisite gifts may be cultivated in spare hours, and 
it may be seen to what point they can attain. Whether he 
ventures to choose his vocation accordingly is the individual’s 
affair; the teacher may be at the same time adviser, but educa- 
tion does not work for the vocation in life. 
The basis of all disposition is physical health. Sickly natures 
feel themselves dependent, robust ones dare to will. Therefore 
the care of health is essentially a part of the formation of char- 
acter, though without belonging to the science of education, 
where even the first principles for that care are wanting. 
IV. 
Influence of the Mode of Life on Character. 
The bad influence which an unsettled mode of life exercises 
on character, has been so repeatedly pointed out by teachers as 
well as others, that it only remains for me to wish they may be 
believed. I hope the most necessary precaution of excluding 
children from their elders’ amusements will not be rebuked as 
pedantry, but, on the contrary, the evident benefit may be 
recognized which is rendered to children by those parents who 
carefully provide through their household arrangements for 
the strict regularity of daily life. 
But I must not forget, that this regularity is sometimes so 
monotonously arranged, is so painfully strict, that the hampered 
energy of youth tries to get free play, and thus, even if the evil 
remain the smallest possible, the formation of character is at 
last diverted from the path of premeditated guidance, and is 
prompted to seek its own road. For it is all over with guid- 
ance, as soon as the pupil says to himself he wills other than 
his teacher. 
 
-P-A-G-E-239
Moral Strength of Character. 219 
We ought, in direct opposition to this, to try and give free 
play to youthful energy. Doubtless this can only be done 
well when the desires have been carefully guided from the 
beginning, and can be done best when these arise out of an 
evenly balanced interest. Obviously, however, the formation 
of character attains certainty of result, just in proportion as 
it is quickened and trained in the period of education. And 
this, according to the preceding, is only possible by making 
youths, even boys, active agents early. Those who grow up 
merely passive, as obedient children, have no character when 
they are released from supervision. They give themselves up 
to their hidden longings and to circumstances, now when no 
one has any longer power over them, or when any power, 
which can still perhaps be exercised, affects them in but a 
crooked manner, and must either drive them off at a tangent or 
crush them altogether. Unfortunately, every one can relate 
sad experiences enough of this kind. 
One hears much of the value of a hardening mode of life for 
the young. I leave the question of physical hardening to stand 
upon itsmerits. I am, however, convinced that the proper hard- 
ening principle for man, who is not merely corporeal, will not 
be found until we learn how to arrange a mode of life for the 
young, whereby they can pursue, according to their own and 
indeed, their right mind, what in their own eyes is a serious 
activity. A certain publicity of life would contribute in no 
small degree to this. But the public activities customary up 
till now will not bear criticism ; for in most cases they lack 
the first requisite of an activity which forms character. They 
do not proceed from the youth’s own mind; they are not the 
acts through which the inward desire determines itself as will. Con- 
sider our examinations through all school classes, from the 
lowest up to the disputations for the doctor’s degree. Add, if 
you like, the speeches and the theatrical exercises by which 
young people are sometimes made forward and smart. The art 
of appearance may gain by all this; but the future man, whom 
you guided through such exercises, will perhaps one day search 
in himself painfully, as vainly, for that power of self-manifesta- 
tion and self-control on which character is based. 
 
-P-A-G-E-240
  220 Science of Education. 
    If I am asked what better exercises can be recommended in 
the place of these, I acknowledge that I have no reply. I do 
not believe that in our present world any important general 
arrangements can be made to enable the young to exercise acti- 
vity suitably; but so much the more do I believe it is the duty 
of individuals to use all the advantages their position commands, 
that they may answer to the needs of those belonging to them. 
I believe that in consideration of this, fathers who allow their 
sons to take part betimes in family concerns will have done 
their character a service. For the rest, all this points back to 
the preceding principle, that the chief seat of the cultivation 
of character is the culture of the circle of thought. For, firstly, 
THOSE CANNOT BE ALLOWED TO ACT ACCORDING TO THEIR OWN MINDS 
WHO HAVE NO RIGHT DESIRES TO SET IN ACTION; they would only 
in so doing progress in badness, and wisdom in such cases con- 
sists much more in restraint. Secondly, if the circle of thought 
has been so perfectly cultivated, that a pure taste entirely rules 
action im the imagination, then anxiety for the formation of 
character in the midst of life is almost at an end, for the indi- 
vidual, left to himself, will so choose opportunities for external 
action, or so use those which force themselves upon him, that 
the right will only become strengthened within his heart. 
V. 
Influences which especially affect the Moral Features of Character. 
Action throughout generates will from desire. It does so in 
the objective of the character, where it is most noticeable, that 
only when the individual’s own action gives him either the 
indirect assurance, or the direct notion of his own power, does 
a confident “I will” result. It does so in the subjective, 
where the individual who not merely talks of principles, but 
really has them, metes out his decision over himself according 
to his opinion of himself, and this latter again according to his 
inward experiences. Consequently, that which seems too lofty 
for men, which they believe themselves incapable of maintain- 
ing, is relegated only too generally by men of firm character to 
   
-P-A-G-E-241
Moral Strength of Character. 221 
the region of pious wishes. Too generally, I say, for they ought 
not to judge of all by themselves. Finally, it is so in that part 
of morality where the true will resides, which, however, is only 
the moral resolution and self-restraint which exercises a con- 
trolling yet purifying influence over the coarse desires, so that 
strength of character, based on moral judgment and warmth, 
may be won and retained. Here also self-control is at first 
only an attempt; it must succeed, must make its power felt in 
inward experience, for, through this action alone, comes that 
energetic moral willing which gives the individual inward free- 
dom. Whatever, therefore, assists self-control, tends to quicken 
and strengthen resolution. It is here that discipline has a great 
and noble task. 
But the pure positive of morality, of which a man’s innermost 
depth must be full, if resolution is to be kept safe from humili- 
ation, if the noble feeling that virtue is free, is to be anything 
more than a brief ecstasy—this primary part of morality, which, 
as moral, is the opposite of arbitrariness, and which, as the 
basis of virtue, is a purely volitionless force, a force solely of 
the naked judgment, to which the desires bend amazed, even 
before resolution has made them feel its doubtful power—this 
belongs entirely to the circle of thought, it depends wholly 
upon what forms this circle. No one grows up amongst men 
without perceiving with his mental eye something of the peculiar 
gesthetic value of the various relations of will, which develop 
everywhere; but how diverse is the intension and sense of these 
perceptions, how varied the clearness of the distinctions, and 
the effect on the whole character. As means to a certain clear- 
ness and analysis, and toan encyclopeedic acquaintance with the 
whole range of the elements of morality and with their most 
general motives in life, instruction of the better sort has for 
some time past provided a number of minor scenes, in which, 
with greater or less success, a story is represented at its supreme 
moment, which must commend itself to the moral consideration 
of the child’s attention by the charm of itsinterest. The service 
our teachers have rendered thereby far exceeds, in my opinion, 
any deficiencies there may have been in the elementary repre- 
sentations. We have, moreover, a selection from a great num- 
   
-P-A-G-E-242
Oe i#ééé..........waneeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee 
222 Science of Education. 
  ber; and the Campe Children’s Library‘ alone can supply many 
very valuable contributions for a future choice collection. But 
for morality, mere acquaintance with its elements is very little ! 
It remains little, even if a whole course of exercises in moral 
acuteness, yes, even if acatechism of practical reason be added.? 
Clearness of judgment, however, does not constitute its weight. 
How far removed is clear insight in moments of conscious re- 
flection from the feeling, which gives warning in the storm of 
passion that the personality is endangered. Moral strength, 
as is well known, is more often separated from moral subtlety 
than united with it. 
Great moral energy is the result of broad views, and of 
whole unbroken masses of thought. He who has long kept 
before his eyes one and the same moral truth with its vivid 
contrasts, in its manifold reflections in the ebb and flow of 
its workings, in the main relations of life, in the family and 
the fatherland—he who has been engrossed in friendship, 
engrossed in religion, but yet without finding himself dis- 
appointed later on, and changing his views—or finally he who 
then with unbiassed mind comes in contact with a novel 
striking phenomenon of social disorder which reveals interest- 
ing characters suffering deeply—such an one we see step forth 
with heroic mind; we see him give help with thoroughness ; 
we see him incautiously destroy; we see him persevering or 
desisting according as the whole personality, or only the 
surface, is penetrated by the impelling principle, according as 
the entire Reflection or only a stray Concentration rouses him 
into action. To attempt to replace the masses of thought active 
there, by a collection of many isolated moral points of contact 
is folly. Novels and dramas must be morally written to be 
pleasing to the right-feeling reader, but no particular efficacy 
can be expected from isolated exaltations upon which a sure 
1 Campe’s Little Children’s Library appeared between 1779-1805, and 
contains fables, moral tales, stories of ancient and modern times, and de- 
scriptions of foreign countries and peoples. Its contents are at the present 
time much read and appreciated by children. 
2 In his letters on the Freedom of the Will, Herbart remarks, ‘* Years 
enough have passed away since Kant published his fragment of a moral cate- 
chism, but no educational miracle has happened.”’ 
 
-P-A-G-E-243
  Moral Strength of Character. 223 
  reaction follows. Their only use in education is as means 
of moral culture in those unhappy cases where knowledge of 
those moral elements must be acquired in later years,! which 
ought to have been supplied in the earliest reading, yes, even 
in the earliest conversations of the mother with her child.” 
The same applies to frequent moral exhortations and sermons, 
indeed even to individual religious services themselves, in so 
far as the primal ideas of religion have not sunk early into 
the depth of the mind. He who will exhort the pupil, must 
do so in such a way that gradually a permanent serious 
relationship may be built up between him and the boy, which, 
together with all its issues, borne upon the young man’s moral 
sense as upon a floating foundation, will create an inde- 
structible feeling of good or ill beyond and above all misgiving. 
Suppose, then, there is really something great and deeply 
affecting in the life, the surroundings, and the destiny of a 
young man, which does not offend his moral sense, but warms 
and inspires; as soon as a single definite object presents itself 
to which his soul clings, he will take as it were a sort of one- 
sided bent, and confound the right and good generally with 
some special mode of its manifestation. A partiality, for ex- 
ample, will be developed resting upon weighty reasons, attract- 
ing him beforehand to many widely diverse men and principles, 
and alienating him from others. Or a species of religious cul- 
ture will clothe him as it were in a uniform garb, so that the 
partisan of a sect, rather than the pure human being, will be 
at once seen inhim. Every predilection will similarly colour 
his mind. Certain demands of right and morality will be 
burnt as it were for ever into his whole being, but will by 
their sharpness have destroyed in him the manifold budding 
of pure nature. Clear concentration (Vertiefung) in the new 
which may offer itself, will be lost amidst the fixed reflection 
(Besinnung) over previously formed convictions. 
1 Note by Herbart.—I assume as a matter of course the most careful 
selection from works of this class (moral). 
2 The imminent danger in such moral readings, etc., is that only what 
Herbart calls formal morality will be gained. For his definition of the 
term, see note, p. 95.
-P-A-G-E-244
  224 Science of Education. 
We seem here to be entangled in a contradiction. We 
require a large tranquil body of thought as a moral power in 
man, and yet if we would choose amongst all such that could 
possibly present themselves for the purpose, we should reject 
each with the objection that it gives us materialised and 
shrivelled up, what we require pure and entire. We want a 
power stronger than the idea, and yet pure as the idea. But 
how can the idea be replaced by a real power, which is not 
something individual, something limited and limiting ? 
I believe all cultured men of our day feel this difficulty. I 
do not mention it here in order to resolve it. Were that in my 
power it would have been done long ago. We have already 
spoken of the connection between manifold concentrations and 
simple reflection, or if you will between culture and inward 
life in relation to true many-sidedness. The entire arrange- 
ment of the circle of thought has been sketched in outline—a 
circle of thought which absorbs into itself whatever can affect 
the mind with a one-sided power,—which takes in, and where 
necessary brings nearer to sympathy, all that is required to 
spread out a wide and continuous plane of thought for such 
a broad survey as, rising of itself to universality, will unite 
purity of idea with the force of experience. 
Unless an isolated part of our comprehensions is to come 
forward in the name of morality, and rule everywhere as its 
plenipotentiary, the powers whose task it is to realise the 
ideal must indeed find a place in every part of our employment 
with human affairs. If the warm heart is to clasp a vast 
serene object, one not partial or limited and yet thoroughly 
real, then all the generations of men, past, present, and nearest 
to us in the future, must be made accessible as a conjoined 
whole to a continuous study—a study which will exercise the 
moral judgment and stimulate religious interest, without 
starving or even repressing the other esthetic faculties or the 
powers of observation and speculation. In this acceptation 
I have in another place named “The esthetic revelation! of 
namely, as an “unveiling” to others of something previously unknown to 
them,
-P-A-G-E-245
Moral Strength of Character. 225 
the world as the chief work of education,” and my reasons 
for so doing were deduced from the concept of morality. 
Those among my contemporaries, who are free from the 
error of taking ideas as such, for powers which are founded in 
absolute freedom—and he who is not free from it should talk 
of anything rather than education—may perhaps at first reply, 
that I treat of things as new, which to them for a long time 
past have been self-understood. “ What,” they would say to 
me, “are our entire efforts for the spread of the humanities, 
but solicitude that the individual in contemplating himself, 
his race, and its whole relation to the rest of the world, may 
directly become conscious of the feeling at once warming and 
inspiring of which the formule of ethics are but the short 
expression ? Long,” it would be said, “have poetry and 
history and the philosophy of history recognized it as their 
vocation to effect with their united power this esthetic and 
at the same time moral revelation of the world! Transcen- 
dental philosophy alone,” they would continue, “ might disturb 
past remedy the progress of these beneficent efforts, might in 
unhappy conjunction with political fraud give new pretexts 
and power of speech to violence and frivolity, the discord of 
which would sound above all beside, till even dull ears would 
feel disquiet and silence be commanded from all sides.1. Then, 
however, all that is necessary is to take up again the threads 
already begun, and as all innovations only harm the progress 
of a work rightly started, we desire simply united labour, not 
new educational schemes.” 
Joint work with such men is in fact only practicable con- 
ditionally on the fact being clearly recognized, that by the 
mere exhibition of historical, philosophical and poetical repre- 
sentations (supposing that these representations can in all 
respects bear historical, philosophical and poetical criticism), 
nothing more is gained than an occasional glance from the

method of employment, which places in the centre of the mind 
a weighty and interconnected (and also articulated)! body of 
knowledge, refiections, and opinions, having such influence and 
such points of contact with everything added to it by the flow 
of time, that nothing can pass by it unnoticed, no new thought 
establish itself, which has not first adjusted its differences 
with what has gone before. For the rest, as regards Transcen- 
dental Philosophy, it has certainly not shown its beneficent 
influence, though it has indeed its superior power, and we do 
not wish to conceal from ourselves that the cessation of its 
prejudicial influence can only be looked for in two ways— 
either by a general relaxation of our studies, or by those studies 
working themselves out completely and amending their own 
faults. What I would yet further add to the principles of 
instruction, already laid down, towards a more exact deter- 
mination of the conception of the world, which I wish prepared 
for by education, can only be accomplished by a philosophy, 
which certainly must be termed transcendental rather than 
popular, although, in the series of the newest systems of our 
time, it finds nothing to which it can attach itself. 
One more important educational point remains, which must 
here be noticed. We know that moral warmth once won is 
easily chilled by the course of events, and by knowledge of the 
world. Worthy teachers have therefore experienced the neces- 
sity of a special preparation for entrance into the world, in 
which they assume the well-brought-up youth will meet with 
many quite unexpected phenomena, and be very often obliged, 
with trouble and pain, to retire into himself out of his custo- 
mary natural and affable openness and trust. The basis of 
this presumption is not so much that the youth will be rash, as 
that the good training itself will have kept everything at a 
distance which could have shocked his moral sense. Early 
1 Note by Herbart.—The expression articulated body seems contradictory. 
But the proof of a perfect instruction is exactly this — that the sum of 
knowledge and concepts which it has raised by clearness, association, sys- 
tem, and method to the highest suppleness of thought, is at the same time 
capable as a mass of interest of impelling the will with the utmost energy, 
by virtue of the complete inter-penetration of all its parts. Because tuis 
is wanting, culture is so often the grave of character.

knowledge of men—it will have none of it! In my eyes an 
educational weakness betrays itself here. However extreme 
the necessity may be that a youth should never become familiar 
with the bad, protection of moral feeling need not be carried 
so far (at least not continued so long) as to make youths 
amazed at men as they are. Bad company is certainly infec- 
tious, and almost as much so is a pleasing lingering of the 
imagination on attractive representations of the bad. But to 
have known men in early life, in all their many varieties, 
ensures an early exercise of moral judgment, as well as a 
valuable security against dangerous surprises. And vivid 
representations of those that were, give doubtless the readiest 
preparation for the observation of those that are, only the past 
must be sufficiently illuminated, so that its men may appear 
men like ourselves, and not beings of another species. It will 
be seen to what I refer. Here I break off, hoping that in 
treating of a system of education I shall be easily forgiven if 
I introduce, in the place where the title only announces the 
natural course of the formation of character, such educational 
remarks as suggest themselves. 
CHAPTER V. 
DISCIPLINE. 
From Discipline (Zucht), from drawing (Ziehen), the term 
education (Erziehung) is derived ; the chief part thus of edu- 
cation in conformity with the name, is usually assigned to that 
which I only now begin to take into consideration towards the 
end of my treatise. 
Education proper is usually contrasted with instruction; I 
have contrasted it with the government of children. Why this 
deviation ? 
The concept of instruction has one conspicuous mark which 
will afford the simplest starting-point for our course. In 
instruction there is always a third something with which 
 
-P-A-G-E-248
eae a ee TTT eT] the eee eae ee 
228 Science of Education. 
teacher and pupil are at the same time occupied. In every 
other function of education, on the contrary, the pupil is 
immediately in the teacher’s mind, as the being upon whom 
he has to work, and who must maintain a passive attitude 
towards him. Thus what causes the teacher’s labowr—on the 
one hand the knowledge to be imparted, on the other the 
restless boy—supplies the basis of division between instruc- 
tion and education proper. Government then must certainly 
itself hide unnoticed within this education proper, for it cannot 
surely be considered to belong to instruction. And thus what 
is intended to keep order, inevitably becomes the principle of 
great disorder in the sphere of education. 
A somewhat closer consideration of the aim of education 
reveals the fact, that the motive of our whole attitude towards 
children is not entirely consideration for them only—for the 
improvement of their mental condition. We restrain them that 
they may not be troublesome; we protect because we love 
them, and this love is meant primarily for the living being in 
whom the parents find their joy ; and then after all this comes 
a voluntary solicitude for the right development of a future 
reasonable being. Now since this last-mentioned solicitude 
doubtless implies for itself a special sphere of activity, (quite 
distinct from all that belongs to the care and protection of 
the animal being, to accustoming it to the conditions under 
which it will be allowed to continue to live in society, for the 
child’s will must be cultured for the one, and for the other it 
must be bent until culture take the place of bending) let 
us hope there will be no hesitation in abandoning at last the 
detrimental confusion of discipline with government. We must 
remember, that when all goes well, government, which is at 
first in the ascendance, must disappear sooner than discipline; 
we should learn to feel that it will be most prejudicial to 
discipline when the teacher, as so often happens, becomes so 
accustomed to governing, that he cannot understand why this 
same act which served him well with little children continually 
fails of its effect with elder ones. He then fancies it is only 
necessary to govern the more advanced pupil in a cleverer 
manner ; finally, seeing he mistook the whole nature of his 
 
-P-A-G-E-249
Moral Strength of Character. 229 
task, he accuses the young man of ingratitude, and perseveres 
in his own perversity, till he bas produced a strained relation- 
ship which continues intolerable and irremediable during the 
whole future. A similar though lesser evil arises, when dis- 
cipline (which in its turn must cease before instruction) is 
continued beyond the proper time; an error which is only 
pardonable, when a very reserved nature conceals the signs 
by which the moment of its legitimate cessation may be 
recognized. 
It will be easy now to define the concept of discipline. It 
has in common with the government of children the property 
that it works directly on the mind, with instruction; that its 
aim is culture. We must only be careful not to confound it 
with government when both use the same measures. In the 
mode of use there are finer distinctions, which I will determine 
in their order. 
I, 
Relation of Discipline to Formation of Character. 
Direct action on the youthful mind with a view to form, is 
discipline. It appears then there is a possibility of forming by 
merely acting on the feelings without reference to the circle of 
thought. It might indeed appear to be so, if we were wont to 
give to concepts logically put together out of properties, the 
credit of reality, without further search. 
But it will appear quite otherwise if we interrogate ex- 
perience. At least, whoever has noticed into what an abyss of 
pain and misfortune a human being may fall, yes even remain 
in it for long periods, and yet, after the time of trouble has 
passed, rise up again apparently almost unchanged the same 
person, with the same aims and opinion, even the same manner 
—whoever we say has noticed this, will hardly expect much 
from that swaying of the emotions, by which mothers especially 
so often believe they are educating their children.’ Besides, 
1 Herbart enlarges on this principle in the Aph. zur Pédagogik, bk. 11, 
p. 475, where he says, “ Never ought the teacher to hope anything from

when we see what degrees of paternal strictness a robust youth 
will endure, and remain untouched, what incentives are wasted 
on weak natures without making them stronger, how temporary 
is the whole reaction which follows the action, we may well 
advise the educator not to prepare for himself false relations, 
which are usually the only residue of mere discipline! 
To me all these experiences are but confirmations of an 
| extremely simple psychological conviction, namely, that all 
: feelings are but passing modifications of the existing presenta- 
tions, and then when the modifying cause ceases, the circle of 
thought must return by itself to its old equilibrium. The only 
result I should expect from mere stimulation of the emotions, 
would be a fatal blunting of the finer feelings, the place of 
which would be taken by an artificial knowing sensibility which 
in the course of years would but foster pretence with all its 
troublesome offshoots. 
The case is indeed entirely different, when the circle of 
thought receives additions as opportunity offers, or when en- 
deavours pass into action and thereby become will. These con- 
ditions must be taken into account in order to interpret expe- 
rience correctly ! 
At this point, we can judge what discipline may be to 
education. All changes of feeling the pupil must suffer, are 
only necessary transitions to determinations of the circle of 
thought, or of character. And thus the relation of discipline 
to formation of character is twofold—indirect and direct. It 
partly helps to make that instruction possible, which will 
influence the subsequent formation of the character of the 
future independent man, is partly a means even now to create, 
or not to create, through action or inaction, as the case may 
be, a beginning of character.! It is impossible to instruct an 
    mere agitation. It would be a misfortune were a wild schoolboy, chastized 
one hour for his pranks, not to be up to similar ones the next—a misfortune 
if his will were so weak and wavering. For then everything accomplished 
by education would yield in the same easy manner to external circumstances 
and their impressions. Obstinacy is to be welcomed, for it can be bent. It 
is only selfishness and malevolence which should not be tolerated.” 
1 « We discriminate between direct and indirect discipline. The latter is 
the more important, since it works on the circle of thought, predisposing

ungovernable boy, and the boyish tricks he plays are to be 
taken in a certain way as indications of his future personality, 
though, as every one knows, with considerable limitations. 
An unruly boy acts mostly from fleeting fancies; doubtless 
he learns thereby what he can do, but the first element neces- 
sary to fix the will is here wanting—a firm, deeply - rooted 
desire. Only where this forms the basis, do boyish tricks 
help to determine character. The first relation of discipline 
to the formation of character is thus the more important— 
that, namely, which clears the way for such instruction as 
will penetrate the thoughts, interests, and desires. Still the 
second ought not to be neglected, least of all in subjects 
who are less mobile and act with firmer purpose. The con- 
cept of discipline formulated in the beginning is, taken merely 
in itself, completely empty. The mere intention to fori 
cannot enter into, or directly act on the mind in such a way 
as to become a power really able to form. Those who by 
means of such an empty discipline show their good intentions, 
work, they know not how, on gentle natures through the 
spectacle they themselves present ; their tender, anxious, urgent 
manner gives the observant boy the idea of the great import- 
ance of the thing, which an otherwise honoured person has so 
much at heart! Such teachers then need only be carefal not 
to mar this spectacle in other ways, not to stifle respect by 
passion or pettiness, or, even a worse thing, lay themselves 
open to the criticism, often as true as it is sharp, of the child. 
Thus they will be able to accomplish much for impressionable 
natures, without however being for that reason safe from com- 
mitting greater errors with less willing ones.

  II. 
Measures of Discipline. 
Discipline occasions feelings or prevents them. Those it 
occasions are either feelings of inclination (Lust) or disinclina- 
tion (Unlust).1_ Those it prevents are avoided either through 
removal of the object which can excite them, or in such a 
way that the object is treated indifferently—either tolerated 
or dispensed with. 
In the case where an object is avoided, whether it be that 
the object is kept out of the sphere of the pupil, or the pupil 
out of that of the object, the pupil experiences as a rule 
absolutely nothing; he at least does not feel this measure 
directly. 
Indifferent sufferance we term Habituation; indifferent re- 
linquishment of that to which we are habituated takes place 
through disuse. 
Inclination is caused by incitement. Not exactly that every 
incitement is felt as attractive, but discipline awakens every 
inclination for the sake of a result; its object is to call out 
activity in the pupil, and to this extent it incites. 
Disinclination is produced by constraint, which in so far as 
any sort of rebellion, even if inward only, be opposed to it, is 
compulsion. 
A definite act of incitement or of constraint, which is motived 
by a definite cause given by the pupil, and which will be looked 
upon as an answer thereto, we term reward or punishment. 
In considering constraint, compulsion, punishment, some 
finer differences require notice, primarily on account of the 
measures of government, which here seem to be merged in 
those of discipline. 
When government has once had recourse to constraints, it 
intends only to be felt as power. Assuming then from the 
preceding, that according to the determination of the aims of 
government, the cases where government must be exercised can

on pain.

  also be recognized, the following rule is valid, namely, that in 
these cases constraint must be used in such a manner, that it 
employs nothing but what is necessary for the accomplishment of 
its aim; the educator must be cool, concise and dry, and appear 
to have forgotten all as soon as the matter is over. Some im- 
portant conclusions regarding the degrees of punishment follow 
from a comparison of the house with the State. Principles are 
wanting here,! but what I assume I will try to explain as briefly 
as possible. There is a distinction between offences per se, and 
offences against the police of the house. Offences per se, where 
an evil intention becomes deed (dolus*) and where damage 
ensues through carelessness, where carefulness was understood 
as a matter of course (partly culpa), may be punished, without 
questioning whether there was knowledge of previously given 
regulations. The degree of culpability in this has then to be 
taken into consideration ; government only takes into account 
the results of actions, later on discipline must look to unexecuted 
intentions. Where an intention ought to exist, and does not, as 
in cases of carelessness, the punishment is usually milder, pro- 
portionally milder the less it can be proved that the intention 
might have been expected. The house police must be made 
known and kept in remembrance by regulations. Its punish- 
ments may be severer according to the relative importance of 
the matter, but here especially the teacher must guard against 
intermingling with such punishments anything of that personal 
influence acting on the mind, which ought to remain in reserve 
for measures of discipline alone. The gradation of punishment 
is most difficult even for the State, it is still more so in the 
house, where everything is contracted into so small a compass. 
But all depends mainly on the tone of the government; through 
1 Discipline often does everything in the hands of intelligent parents. 
Discipline often spoils everything in public institutions. Why? With the 
former it represents order, with the latter arbitrariness. Aph. zur 
Pddagogik, bk. 11, p. 479. 
2 By culpa penal justice understands every act of commission or omission 
which is objectively unlawful or subjectively imputable; by dolus, every act 
intentionally done with the consciousness of unlawfulness. It is obvious 
dolus implies genuine malevolence of will, culpa only weakness of will; 
therefore the former is much more punishable than the latter. 
 
-P-A-G-E-254
  234 Science of Education. 
  this the boy must feel he has to act and will be treated, not as 
a pupil, but as a human being in society ; through this he must 
be prepared for future social life. To this extent a definite 
government of children is at the same time a part of instruc- 
tion.} 
Entirely different is the tone of discipline—not short and 
sharp, but continuous, persevering, slowly penetrating, and only 
ceasing by degrees. For discipline is to be felt as a forming 
principle. What is felt, certainly does not constitute the 
essence of its forming power ; but it cannot conceal the purpose 
of forming. And even if it could, it must present that purpose, 
merely to be endurable. Who would not resist, or at least 
inwardly resent, treatment under which cheerfulness so often 
suffers, and out of which a constant feeling of dependence arises, 
were no sort of strengthening and elevating principle to be 
inferred as underlying it? Discipline must not affect the mind 
crookedly, must not be felt as acting against its aims; the pupil 
must on no account.be in inward opposition to it, and go off at a 
diagonal as if driven by two opposing forces. But whence can 
a genuine open susceptibility be forthcoming if not from child- 
like faith in the teacher’s beneficent purpose and power? And 
how can frigid, repellent, distant behaviour create this belief? 
On the contrary, discipline finds room only so far as an inward 
experience persuades its subjects to submit to it willingly. 
Whether it be emotions of taste, recognition of just censure, or 
feelings of pleasure and pain about a success or failure, the 
power of discipline only reaches as far as the pupil’s assent 
meets it. And the teacher must only wish to extend his activity 
in proportion as he obtains this assent—in proportion as he 
succeeds. In early years, the fact that discipline is a milder 
substitute for government, to which latter the child submits 
because it must, comes to the teacher’s aid. At a later stage it 
is different. A young man who governs himself feels in dis- 
cipline its importunate claim to mould him. And if the teacher 
does not know how to make an end of discipline at this point, 
1 «This thought was expressed in book 1, page 86, only what is there called 
Discipline ought rather to have been termed Government. I could not 
make use of my technical terms in the Introduction.”—-Note by Herbart.

  Moral Strength of Character. 235 
  gradual efforts to throw off the influence will become apparent. 
These will be easily successful, for courage grows quickly, 
restraint disappears, the painfulness of a relationship increases, 
which, without heavy counterweights of confidence, of respect, 
and above all an inward feeling on the part of the pupil of 
his own need, will of itself soon bring about its retarded dis- 
solution. 
Let us now seize the core of the matter. Discipline is 
properly not so much a conjunction of many measures, of 
wholly separate acts, as a continuous treatment, which only now 
and then for the sake of emphasis resorts to rewards and 
punishments and similar expedients. The governed and the 
governor, the teacher and the taught, are persons who live 
with, and inevitably affect, each other agreeably or disagree- 
ably. Do we not, when we approach an acquaintance, always 
enter into some definite atmosphere of feelings? What atmo- 
sphere? This ought not, as regards education, to depend on 
chance; but constant care is necessary in the first place to 
weaken the effect of this atmosphere, if there is danger that it 
may become hurtful,! and in the second to strengthen its 
beneficial influences to that degree which the formation of 
character—whether the direct, or indirect through the medium 
of the circle of thought—requires for its security. 
It is obvious that the art of discipline is primarily but a 
modification of the art of intercourse with men, and therefore 
social tact is a valuable gift in the teacher. The essence of 
its modification here is, that on it depends the maintenance of a 
superiority over children in such a way as to make a moulding 
power felt, which thus animates even when it constrains, but 
where it directly encourages and attracts, follows there and 
there only its natural direction. 
Discipline does not acquire its full momentum till after it 
has found an opportunity of showing to the pupil his better 
1 For instance, teacher and pupil ought not to be compelled to be con- 
stantly together in one room. A special room for himself is of all stipula- 
tions the most important to the tutor. Parents who know their own 
interest will offer it spontaneously to prevent the inevitable feeling of 
mutual oppression,—Note by Herbart,

self, by means of an approbation (not exactly praise) powerfully 
affecting him. For reproof falls on receptive ears only when 
it has ceased to stand alone as a minus quantity ; it must only 
threaten to cancel in part the. approbation already won, for 
those alone feel the stress of inward reproaches, who have 
attained to self-respect, and fear to lose something of it. Any 
other pupil accepts himself as he is, and he who is blamed 
only, will be indignant if the teacher will not take him as he 
is. Where mere blame has any effect, self-respect has already 
been at work. The teacher will do well to seek for it, but 
not blindly to depend on it. And it is not enough that this 
self-respect should be present to a small extent; it must reach 
such a degree that blame can lay hold of it. But, it may be 
urged, we can only give approbation where it is deserved. 
However true this may be, it is also true that next to the 
question of the possibility of forming the circle of thought, the 
one most important in generally determining the possibility of 
education is, whether special features of character already exist 
which are worthy to win the teacher’s heart? At least the 
individuality must spontaneously show some sense of good feel- 
ing on which the teacher can fasten to elevate it. And where, to 
begin with, he can fasten but on little, he must “‘ make haste 
slowly,” for discipline will have power only to kindle one spark 
at a time from another, and he must therefore be content for a 
while, with little to gain little, till gradually, if the work pro- 
ceeds undisturbed, the store will be enlarged, and be sufficient 
to meet the problems of education. 
To give joy by deserved approbation is the fine art of disci- 
pline. That art can be but rarely learned; it is more easily 
discovered by those whose minds are attuned to love it heartily. 
There is likewise a sad art—that of unerringly wounding the 
spirit of a child; which art, however, we must not despise. It 
is often indispensable, when simple speech falls on a deaf ear. 
But gentle feeling, enjoining forbearance and at the same time 
extenuation, must rule it throughout; this is all that art requires 
to avoid imperious severity.!   
‘ Compare the following from Aphor. zur Pidagogik. ‘‘ The natural

  Just as a singer practises to discover the compass and finest 
gradations of his voice, the teacher must in thought practise 
going up and down the scale of treatment. This he must do, not 
with any idea of pleasure to himself, but that he may banish with 
sharp self-criticism every dissonance, attain the necessary cer- 
tainty in producing every note, the requisite flexibility for all 
turns, and the indispensable knowledge of the limits of his organ. 
He has good reason for timidity during the early months, when- 
ever he is obliged to use any tone going beyond that usual to civil 
intercourse; he has every reason to observe himself and his pupil 
most critically. This observation must indeed remain the con- 
stant corrective of his rapidly growing habits, all the more so, 
because the pupil changes as time goes on. If the same reminder 
be necessary time after time, it must not be given twice in the 
same manner, or, just because it was efficacious in the first in- 
stance, it will have lost its effect in the second. All monotony, 
everything insipid, must be as rigorously banished from disci- 
pline, as from a good book or speech. Only when such careful- 
ness exists in conjunction with a certain inventive power, is 
there hope that the teacher will attain the force he requires. 
For the extent of discipline must appear illimitable to the pupil, 
and its influence to have nothing comparable with it in value. 
It must so surround his whole activity as a constant coherent 
element, that the thought, he can escape it, may not even occur 
to him. It must be ever ready to make itself felt; but it also, if 
goodness which we find existent in the pupil must stand in the fore- 
front of education as of the highest importance. Without it education is 
impossible, for it has no point of departure and therefore no possibility 
of progress. We ought first to recognize, and secondly to make the exis- 
tent good valuable in the eyes of the pupil himself, show him his better 
separated from his worse self, and so bring forth in him himself the dis- 
harmony; without doing so he can never approach to virtue, We must 
set him at variance with himself, for he must educate himself. . . . We 
must arouse approval that he may have a standard for judgment; on the 
degree of importance he attaches to just approbation depends the force of 
reproof. The teacher, therefore, must pass outside his own individuality, 
recognize what deserves recognition, not estimate anything beyond its value, 
nor blame too severely what appears to him strange and paradoxical in the 
pupil. He must possess the power of appreciating with his whole soul, 
and must understand the art of expressing approbation witliout praise. Praise 
is mostly poisonous to the young, making them proud and regardful of words 
rather than of love. Merit marks and similar things are entirely harmful.”

really capable of something, must constantly and carefully keep 
watch over itself, so that it may not through over-hastiness 
inflict needless pain on the pupil. A boy of gentle disposition 
may suffer deeply, may suffer in secret, and bury in his heart 
suffering which will still be felt in the years of manhood. 
To bear the full effect of a perfect discipline, the pupil must 
have perfect health. But little training is possible, when ill 
health has to be considered; a healthily-ordered life therefore 
must be alike the basis and the first preparation for education." 
If all is as it should be on both sides—if the purest suscepti- 
bility is there to meet duly proportioned discipline—all will pass 
away like music, and no lasting effect will remain, beyond this— 
that the stones will raise themselves to the sound of that music 
into the walls of a well-defined circle of thought, wherewith to 
provide for the character a safe and a happy dwelling-place.

Employment of Discipline in General. 
(1) Co-operation of Discipline in the formation of the circle of 
thought. 
The whole tone, much more than the hours of study, is in- 
fluenced by this co-operation. To maintain quiet and order in 
the lessons, to banish every trace of disrespect to the teacher, 
is the work of government. But attention, lively comprehen- 
sion,’ is something more than quiet and order. Children may 
be mechanically trained to sit perfectly still while they do not 
take in a word! Much must combine to produce attention. In- 
struction must be comprehensible, and yet difficult rather than 
easy, otherwise it causes ennwi. It must continuously maintain 
the same interest—of which we have spoken previously. But 
the pupil must also come with the right frame of mind, it must 
be habitual to. him. This is the business of discipline. The 
whole mode of life must be free from disturbing influences ; no 
interest preponderating for the moment must absorb the mind.

This is certainly neither always nor entirely in the teache:’s 
power, indeed the fruit of his work may be entirely destroyed 
by a single accident, which may carry away the pupil’s 
thoughts. Itis more in his power to impress on him strongly 
how much depends on the closest attention, in such a 
manner that the boy will no longer pardon himself for not 
appearing entirely collected at the lessons. He who has 
achieved this may grieve, when, notwithstanding his efforts, 
some overmastering influence distracts the hardly-won interest ; 
yet he will yield, he will follow and sympathetically keep the 
pupil company, for he cannot commit a graver error than to 
sever the relation by premature prohibition. In spite of such 
wanderings, the pupil returns from distractions small or gren'. 
with the characteristics of his previously ordered thought. 
He recollects the old, the teacher can re-tie the thread, he 
interweaves the new; moments may be chosen to analyse it. 
Only the same flexibility, willingness, openness, must always 
be continuously created anew, for all direct action of discipline 
is transitory. 
If the pupil has already reached the point where he can pur- 
sue his right way independently, then he needs much rest! 
Then is the time for gradually dropping all the claims of dis- 
cipline, and for the teacher to confine himself to sympathetic, 
friendly, trustful observation. The sole aim of advice must be 
to induce the individual to consider the matter himself. Nothing 
at this point is more beneficial, nor will be more thankfully 
received by the pupil, than friendly endeavours to ward off all 
unseasonable interruptions, that the inner man may as soon as 
possible become clear and composed. 
(2) Formation of Character by Discipline. 
How ought egoistic + action to be limited and encouraged ? 
It is assumed here, that government has already checked all 
misbehaviour, which, besides its direct outward consequences, 
would develop coarse traits of dishonesty and the like in the 
mind of the boy himself. 
Above all things, however, it must not be forgotten, that   
1 Self action, not selfish action is here meant. 
 
-P-A-G-E-260
  240 Science of Education. 
  to the action of men belongs not merely what meets the eye, 
but also inward achievement, and that only the two united can 
lay the foundation of character. The great activity of healthy 
children, which their need of movement expresses, the constant 
stratagems of inconstant natures, even the coarse pleasures of 
those who give indications of a wild manliness—all these ap- 
parent signs of future character do not reveal to the teacher so 
much as a single silent, well-weighed, compassed act of asettled 
mind, or as the single steadily maintained defiance of an other- 
wise docile child. And here therefore much reflection must be 
united with observation. Firmness, properly speaking, never 
exists in children ; they cannot resist the variation of the circle of 
thought which is borne in on them from so many sides—among 
others it is to be hoped from the side of the teacher. But where 
an action of a child shows decided inclination, armed by de- 
liberation, discipline can effect hardly anything, unless we 
reckon it something firstly, that after opportunities have been 
cut off, capability can no longer be produced by exercise, 
in which case we need only take care to cut the opportunities 
entirely off ; and secondly, that the teacher must acknowledge 
he can only restrain the imagination by lively and attractive 
occupations of another kind, which again comes under the head 
of influence upon the circle of thought. Let this be taken 
to heart, when any kind of ingrained perversity is to be exter- 
minated, and discipline must mainly be used to that end. But 
in such cases desist totally from severe punishments. Such are 
suitable when an isolated new inclination breaks out thought- 
lessly as a fault for the first or second time, which, without 
fear, would be repeated, and engrave a wrong trait on the 
character. Discipline in such cases must interfere immediately 
and decidedly. Thus the first self-interested lie can hardly be 
too severely punished, hardly warned against too often by 
repeated admonitions gradually becoming gentler, hardly be 
made too hateful by pain penetrating deeply to the innermost 
soul. Such treatment would make, on the other hand, the de- 
liberate liar even more deceitful and insidious. The false rela- 
tion in which he places himself ought gradually to close around 
him with increasing pressure; this alone however, is no good—
-P-A-G-E-261
SS ae Te ee 
Moral Strength of Character. 241 
  the whole mind must be raised, the possibility of winning for 
himself respect, which is incompatible with lying, must be made 
perceptible and valuable to him. But can any one accomplish 
this, who does not possess the art of affecting the circle of 
thought from all sides? or do you think a few isolated speeches 
and admonitions will effect it ? 
External activity, without strong steady inclination and 
deliberation, wherein more physical than mental disposition is 
conspicious, lays no foundation of character ; on the contrary, it 
hinders the growth of firmness of character. It may be suffered 
| as an expression of joyousness and an aid to health and agility, 
indeed it gives the teacher time to prepare everything for the 
determination of character which steps in later, and it is to that 
extent advantageous. On the other hand it is not desirable, 
because a later formation of character might possibly be de- 
layed till after the period of education. Accordingly, if the 
formation of the circle of thought has been retarded, or if it 
must be essentially corrected, nothing will be more welcome 
than the continued vacillation of youthful desires; if, on the 
other hand, the existing circle of thought gives hopes of a right 
formation of character, then it is the time, be the age what it 
may, to unite an earnest activity with it, that the individuality 
may soon fix itself. For him who has been too early stimulated 
in any great degree to activity, education is a thing of the 
past, or it can at any rate only be re-commenced with many 
drawbacks and partial results. But above all, external activity 
must never be so much over-stimulated that mental respiration 
—alternation of acts of concentration and reflection—is dis- 
turbed thereby. There are natures with whom, from their earliest 
years, the teacher’s principle must be to keep within due limits 
all external incitements to their activity. They would other- 
wise never arrive at depth, good conduct, worth; they would 
never have room in the world; they would spoil things merely 
for the sake of having something to do, they would be feared, 
and, when possible, repulsed. With those, who in early life give 
themselves up exclusively and passionately to an unintellectual 
occupation, it certainly may be taken for granted, they are, and 
will remain empty heads, and will become all the more unbear- 
RB   
 
-P-A-G-E-262
  242 Sczence of Education. 
able because not even the one interest which at present gives them 
life, will last in like strength and protect them from ennui. 
After these remarks, we must consider the distinctions 
pointed out a short time ago in the objective as well as in the 
subjective part of character. 
In the first place, the disposition (Anlage) must in regard to 
the memory of willing be completed by discipline. It will be 
remembered, that a simple uniform mode of life, the absence of 
all disturbing change, contributes to this. But how far the 
teacher’s treatment may specially help to achieve this, will be 
most easily understood, if we realize how different is the impres- 
sion we receive from living with persons of firm or of change- 
able mind. With the latter, relations are always variable ; we 
require double the force to maintain our own consistency with 
them, that we need with those who imperceptibly imbue us 
with their own steadfastness, and smooth our path by always 
maintaining the same relation. In education, however, it is a 
matter of paramount difficulty always to show the same face to 
children under the same circumstances, for there are innumer- 
able things by which we are moved, but which they can as little 
understand as experience. And where a number of children are 
together, the very work of education affects them so much and 
so variously, that special care is required to give back to each 
child the tone of mind he aroused, and not to confuse the 
various tones of treatment, and falsify by mingling them with 
each other. Here the teacher’s natural disposition comes into 
play, and with it his experience gained from intercourse with 
men. Where the latter is wanting, and the former influences 
unfavourably, the failure of discipline may then often arise 
solely from the fact, that the teacher does not know how to 
master himself sufficiently to appear equable, so that those en- 
trusted to him grow puzzled, and give up the hope of being able 
to please him. The latter condition is the extreme opposite of 
the first essential of a character-forming discipline. For there- 
by so much of memory of willing as was self-existent, will be 
diminished precisely to the extent that discipline is successful, 
and character will be driven to build itself up in some hidden 
depth. A discipline that supports (by this predicate I indicate 
 
-P-A-G-E-263
Moral Strength of Character. 243 
  the legitimate co-operation with the memory of the willing) 
will be most successful with those who by nature are equably- 
minded. 
Those, however, who pride themselves on this advantage, 
must guard against the absence of a second qualification. 
Discipline ought also to act determinatingly, that choice may be 
made. And to this end a mobile mind is necessary, which 
knows how to answer always to the movements of the youth- 
ful soul. More even depends on the concentration of the 
teacher’s mind than on his disposition (Anlage); that mind 
must be so completely given up to the work of education, that 
he himself, influenced in a great measure by the pupil, will 
again influence him by a natural reflex influence. He must enter 
into all the boy’s innocent wishes, into what is in some degree 
_ based on his opinions and views; he must not wish prematurely 
to correct sharply anything that may serve him as a point of 
contact, for we must certainly be completely in touch with 
those we desire to influence. However, this can be better carried 
out in action than by the pen. To write about the second 
point of determining discipline is easier; it must multiply im- 
pressively enough the natural determining feelings around the 
boy, it must encompass him with the consequences of every mode 
of action and thought. That which goes to make up choice 
must not dazzle the pupil by any deceptive glitter; passing 
pleasantnesses or troubles must not act as snares to attract or 
terrify ; the true worth of things must be felt early enough. Among 
educational arrangements to secure this, the punishments proper 
to education are conspicuous, which are not bound to a propor- 
tioned retribution as are the punishments of government, but 
must be so meted out, that they always appear to the individual 
as well-meant warnings, and do not excite lasting opposition to 
the teacher. The pupil’s way of feeling will here decide every- 
thing. 
Regarding the quality of the punishments, the difference be- 
tween those of education and of government is at once apparent 
of itself. While the latter merely renders the deserved quantum 
of good or ill, no matter in what way, the former, on the other 
hand, avoids the positive and the arbitrary as much as possible, 
 
-P-A-G-E-264
  244 Science of Education. 
  and has to lay hold where it can, solely of the natural conse- 
quences of human action. For it (the punishment of educa- 
tion) should early determine the pupil’s mind in such a way as 
he, with riper experience, and perhaps with wits sharpened 
through suffering, would himself afterwards determine. More- 
over, the choice which it causes may be a passing one, or later 
on become uncertain. Educational rewards are to be arranged 
on these principles; but they will have little effect unless a 
complete system of treatment lies at the basis, to which they 
can give force. But enough of a subject which has already 
occupied teachers so much.’ 
The subjective of the character rests, as already shown, 
on the individual. expression of self in principles. Discipline 
co-operates with it as a regulating procedure. Added to this, 
the pupil’s choice is supposed to have been already made, and 
should not be further unsettled; all perceptible interference 
and encroachment must cease. The pupil acts by himself, the 
teacher will only measure him by the scale which the pupil 
himself puts into his hand. His treatment makes the pupil 
feel that it does not understand, does not know how to requite, 
inconsequent action, that intercourse will be suspended in con- 
sequence, and that the only thing to do is to wait till the 
young man is pleased to return to his wonted course. Many 
who desire to be men betimes, require to have their attention 
called to the unripeness and prematureness of the principles 
they have picked up. This can rarely be done directly, for 
those whose firmness is open to suspicion are only too easily 
offended. As occasion offers, the youthful logic-chopper must 
be caught in his own trap, or allowed to meet with a rebuff in 
his intercourse with the outer world. It is easy at the right 
moment to lead the confused youth back to modesty, and to 
1 «Yet the teacher attempt nothing by reward and punishment which 
will not raise and enhance his personal worth in the eyes of the pupil. If he 
does not possess this personal affection and esteem, his means will be of 
little use, he will effect nothing. All single acts of discipline depend on the 
relation of the whole of education which the teacher has already given the 
pupil, for all admonitions and warnivgs call to memory only what is already 
known. Single disciplinary acts as single are worthless, and determine 
nothing.” —Aphor. zur Pddagogik. 
 
-P-A-G-E-265
Moral Strength of Character. 245 
let him see the next steps of culture. The more successfully 
such presumptuous principles are relegated to the rank of mere 
preliminary exercises in self-determination, the more clearly will 
the individual’s true opinions come out as maxims,! and the true 
objective of the character will be strengthened through the 
corresponding subjective. But at this point there is a rock 
ahead, on which an otherwise right education may easily be 
wrecked. Those principles which really come up from the 
mind’s depth, will not bear the same treatment as the maxims 
of mere argument. If the teacher but once treats slightinyly 
what is really a serious matter to the pupil, the consequences 
may cost him long labour. He may throw light upon it, may 
blame it, but must never despise it, as if it were mere words. 
Yet this may happen as the result of a natural error. Verbose 
young people, who are at that period when they struggle for 
expression, often use such expression as the language of their 
truest feelings, and thus unwittingly invite a criticism on them- 
selves which often inflicts the sorest wrong. 
The conflict in which the principles are trying to assert them- 
selves should be aided by discipline, provided they deserve it. 
In this, two points are of primary importance—accurate know- 
ledge of the pupil’s condition of mind, and authority. For it is 
the inward authority of the pupil’s own principles, which must 
be strengthened and supplemented by an authority exactly 
analogous from without. According to these considerations the 
teacher’s conduct will be guided. Careful observation of the 
pupil engaged in the struggle must come first; quiet, firm, 
carefully persevering earnestness must seek to perfect it. 
The consideration of moral culture introduces into all this 
many modifications. Far from memory of the will being al- 
ways desirable, the art of discipline consists much rather in 
putting to shame and confusion bad endeavours, and in hush- 
ing them into forgetfulness, by means of everything which 
employs the mind in other and opposite directions. The choice 
ought not to be determined so entirely in the light of the deeply 
impressed consequences of the act, that the worth of the good 
1 See Note 1, p. 202.
-P-A-G-E-266
  246 Science of Lwiucation. 
will, considered apart from consequences, becomes obscured 
thereby. The objective of the character must first go forth to 
meet the moral criticism, before we can further its elevation 
into principles, or help its assertion through conflict. 
In early years, when instruction and environment invite the 
boy to the first moral apprehensions, the moments when the 
mind appears to be occupied with them must be observed and 
left undisturbed. The frame of mind must be kept calm and 
clear; this is the first aid discipline should give here. It has 
been often said, and cannot in a certain point of view be too 
often repeated, that the childlike mind of children ought to be 
preserved. But what is it that ruins this childlike mind, this 
unconscious look straight into the world, which seeks nothing, 
and for that very reason sees what is to be seen? LHverything 
ruins it which tends to destroy the natural forgetfulness of self. 
The healthy person is not conscious of his body; in just this 
sense the untroubled child ought not to feel his existence, that 
he may not make that existence the measure of the importance 
of that which is outside him. Then, it is to be hoped, the clear 
perception of moral right and wrong will be amongst the ob- 
servations he makes; in the same way and as he looks at others 
in this respect, he will look at himself; as the particular falls 
under the general, so will he find himself thrown under his 
own censorship. This is the natural beginning of moral cul- 
ture, weak and uncertain in itself, but to be strengthened by 
instruction. But it will be interfered with by every strong 
and lasting stimulus that gives prominence to the feeling of self, 
and thus makes the individual self the point of reference for 
the world outside it. Hither joy or pain may be such a stimu- 
lus. The latter occurs in disease and sickness, even in merely 
very excitable temperaments, and teachers have long known 
that moral development suffers under it. The same result will 
follow upon harsh treatment, exaggerated teasing, or neglect of 
that care which is due to the needs of children. In contrast 
1 See translators’ Introduction, p. 24. 
2 ‘I'he theoretical comprehension of the individual self—the knowledge of 
self need not therefore be feared; it will but show that the individual is 
as vinmall as ie really is, in the midst of things.—Note by Herbart.
-P-A-G-E-267
Moral Strength of Character. 247 
with this we rightly advise the gratification of the natural 
joyfulness of children. With equal reason again, education 
discourages everything which stimulates prominence of the 
individual self through feelings of pleasure; everything, 
that is, which satisfies the desires without a use, which en- 
courages the premature development of wishes that belong to 
later years, everything which fosters conceit and selfishness. 
On the contrary, children, boys and youths must be accus- 
tomed to bear the reproof suitable to, and called forth by each 
age, so long as it is just and comprehensible. It is a cardinal 
point of discipline to be careful that the general tone of en- 
vironment, like public opinion, permits the expression of reproof 
to be rightly heard, without making it repugnant by mortifying 
additions. That this voice is understood and corroborated by 
the pupil’s own silent acknowledgment ! is a less important, but 
by no means superfluous, aid to the endeavours of the teacher. 
If the teacher is obliged single-handed to represent the general 
voice, or even to contradict it, he will find it difficult to give 
weight to his reproof. It is then of paramount importance that 
he should possess absolute authority, by the side of which the 
pupil has no respect for any other judgment. In earlier years 
moral elementary instruction is practically blended with this 
judgment, which we here relegate to mothers and the better 
class of writings for children, begging only that it may not be 
converted into the stamping in of maxims—a process which, if 
everything goes on as well as possible, unduly hastens and even 
disturbs the subjective formation of character, besides being 
harmful to childlike ingenuousness. | 
It is wise, indeed absolutely necessary, to protect and foster 
the child’s tender feeling at this period, by the removal of 
everything which may accustom the imagination to what is 
morally hateful. The care which this involves does not neces- 
1 Sincere acknowledgment, when there is obvious occasion for it, ought 
not to be obstinately shirked; it must not, however, be made through the 
fault of the teacher an easy play, a habit, an artifice, whereby to win coaxing. 
He who confesses willingly is not ashamed of himself, and from him who 
confesses by action that he attends to remonstrance, only an extremely 
rough discipline would wish to extort farther words.—Note by Herbart. 
 
-P-A-G-E-268
248 Science of Education. 
sitate specially restrictive measures, so long as the body re- 
quires continuous care and watchfulness. But the mother must 
not prevent the child from running free in the fields as soon 
as it can, and teachers are unwise in adding to care for the 
physical well-being, moral anxiety also. For with advancing 
years, this so easily tends to dominate all the surroundings, and 
loses sight of the fact, that coddling in moral matters, just as 
in all others, is the worst means of protecting individuals 
against the harmfulness of climate. Warding off outward 
cold does not mean increasing inward warmth; but, on the 
contrary, moral warmth arises for the most part out of 
true work and conflict, in which already existent power is 
gradually firmly established through the stings of external ill. 
It is only the negligent teacher who finds that his boy takes up 
and imitates everything which he sees. Moderate care on the 
part of the teacher makes the pupil follow for himself the course 
of his own culture, and observe and judge the behaviour of 
coarse natures as a strange phenomenon, not to be compared 
with his own endeavours. If he comes into contact with them, 
they will so often offend his more delicate feeling, and on the 
other hand make his mental superiority so pleasant to him, 
that the teacher, if he has previously done his duty, will now 
have trouble to re-establish the necessary intercourse between 
the boy trained by him, and the others whose fate it has been 
to be neglected. But it is just in such designedly selected 
companionship by which the pupil’s self-sufficiency is-to be 
counteracted, that his consciousness will take its stand the more 
firmly on the moral, the more violently the immoral repels him. 
Such a course discipline, taking into account the environ- 
ment, must take. In so doing, considerable strength of 
morality, already well founded, is certainly presupposed. That 
I need not repeat how much here depends upon the circle of 
thought, I call attention only to the most important point in 
the teacher’s treatment. Well-earned approbation, quietly but 
abundantly given out of a full heart, is the spring upon which 
the force of an abundant, convincing, carefully apportioned 
blame, emphasized by the most varied applications, must work, 
until the time arrives when the pupil possesses both praise and 
 
-P-A-G-E-269
Moral Strength of Character. 249 
blame within himself, and can guide and impel himself by 
their means. For a time does come, sooner or later, when the 
teacher’s words will be superfluous—that will be when he con- 
tinues to express what the pupil says just as well to himself. At 
this point acertain confidence begins between teacher and pupil, 
unsuited to an earlier period, which, in the form of reflections on 
general events, reverts every now and then to that which every 
individual has to work out in regard to his own moral being. 
We have now arrived at the sphere of moral resolve and 
self-constraint. If emphatic speech has here no legitimate 
place, frequent reminders and warnings, ever more and more 
gentle, perform the essential service of fixing attention more 
steadfastly and proportionately on self-observation. For mo- 
rality does not consist merely in the goodness and force of 
the resolve; much depends on the swm of its points of contact 
with all parts of the circle of thought. A kind of OMNIPRESENCE 
of moral criticism is the necessary condition of moral truth.} 
This criticism can hardly be expressed gently enough by the 
tongue of a stranger, and conversely, when strong words are 
used, and we want to blame and admonish with a certain 
thoroughness, we must choose moments which can give occasion 
for a survey, a revision of a long series of offences; we rise 
above the isolated cases which are only instances, but which, 
if looked at from a higher point of view, give clearness to the 
general consideration. Otherwise we appear to dress up petty 
unimportant things in big words. 
Finally, with regard to that which supports moral con/flict, 
the whole of the existing relation between pupil and teacher 
must determine how they should respectively approach and be 
in touch with each other. Behaviour which assumes the exis- 
tence of a confidence really broken, would be as wrong as

be full, if resolution is to be kept safe from humiliation . . . this primary 
part of morality, which, as moral, is the opposite of arbitrariness, and which, 
as the basis of virtue, is a purely volitionless force, a force solely of the 
naked judgment, to which the desires bend amazed, even before resolution 
has made them feel its doubtful power—this belongs entirely to the circle 
of thought; it depends wholly upon what forms this circle.—Science of 
Education, p. 221. 
 
-P-A-G-E-270

that confidence is desirable. Is it possible for any one to 
express all this more minutely in general rules? I prefer to 
leave it to the teacher’s humanity and zeal carefully to search 
out the place where, and the manner in which, he can in 
moments of danger most safely and successfully reach and 
raise those intrusted to his care. 
CHAPTER VI. 
REVIEW OF THE DETAILS OF DISCIPLINE. 
Ar this stage, where a circumstantial science of education 
would have the opportunity of expounding the whole treasure 
of its observations and experiments, though without producing 
an organic whole, I will for two reasons be even briefer than 
the plan of this work in itself would allow. Firstly, I should 
be compelled, in dealing with individual expressions of morality 
and of moral discipline, to give definite references to my practical 
philosophy, which has not yet appeared ; they cannot however, 
even in the briefest treatment, be entirely ignored. Secondly, 
I must assume that all readers of this book have previously 
studied Niemeyer’s work, which has become classical amongst 
us—classical on account of its language, and the consistency of 
its execution. It is especially valuable to me on account of the 
wealth of subtle observations, scattered everywhere, concern- 
ing all the details of educational activity. An accumulation 
of such observations perhaps of greater value than the rest, 
are to be found in paragraphs 115 to 130 of the first volume, 
which lays down the special principles of moral education with 
regard to individual virtwes and vices. I take this opportunity 
of asking the reader, when comparing Niemeyer’s principles 
with mine, to look for those in which we agree, rather than 
for those in which we disagree. Such a comparison I regard 
as more useful and honourable to me than if one were to go 
round and round with the customary question—How much is 
new? A fundamental disagreement would certainly exist 
between Niemeyer and myself, if he were entirely in earnest 
 
-P-A-G-E-271
Moral Strexgin of Character. WN wi ea 
  in the preface, where he writes, “in matters of education 
everything depends on extended experience.” If Locke and 
Rousseau affirmed that, I should know exactly how to square 
their words with the spirit of their writings, and then at 
once declare myself their opponent. Herr Niemeyer will 
pardon me for believing in his work more than his words. 
What most distinctively raises him above foreigners, and entitles 
us to think with pride of our nationality, is in my eyes the 
definite moral tendency of his principles, whereas in the prin- 
ciples of Locke and Rousseau crude impulse holds entire sway, 
and, barely mitigated by a highly unstable moral feeling, leads 
to a superficial sensuous life. I certainly need not prove in 
opposition to Herr Niemeyer, that true moral principles cannot 
be learned from experience, but on the contrary the comprehen- 
sion of experiences is modified by the mind with which each 
individual meets them. And thusall appearance of dispute will 
be avoided, if I add the confession that this book owes its 
existence almost as much to my little collection of carefully 
arranged observations and experiments gathered together on 
very various occasions, as it does to my philosophy. 
i. 
Occasional and Permanent Discipline. 
The same principle, which determined the separation of 
analytical from synthetical instruction, can be taken into con- 
sideration in regard to discipline. For with it too, much 
depends upon what the pupil brings; and, as instruction analyses 
the circle of thought which it finds existent, in order to correct 
it, so the pupil’s condnct often requires true and responsive 
vuidance, and fortuitous circumstances need a regulation of their 
consequences. Something similar takes place in the manage- 
ment of every business, and makes us conscious of the difference 
between isolated, interrupted, occasional measures, and that 
settled procedure which works onward under the same pre- 
sumptions according to the same plan. It is also in general 
true, that the more in accordance with its aim this settled pro- 
cedure is arranged, and the more strictly it is followed, the 
 
-P-A-G-E-272
  252 Science of Education. 
more will the result be a kind of well-being, supplying forces 
that will serve for the utilization of favourable chances, as 
well as for the avoidance of everything harmful. This must 
not be forgotten with discipline. There is here a species of 
false economy, which, when occasion serves, would try to win 
much in a moment, and neglects in so doing to take care of, 
and continually to increase what is already won; there is on 
the contrary a right and infallible method of acquiring, which 
disposes and grasps all relationships in such a way that the 
same opinions, the same resolves, are always created anew, and 
are thereby strengthened and established. 
We must therefore be above all things careful, that this 
settled discipline enters and continues in the right track, and 
this care must be increased at times, when measures occasion- 
ally used may have somewhat disturbed previously well-ordered 
relationships. Exceptional treatment as well as exceptional 
events, special punishments and rewards, leave impressions 
behind which do not last, and ought still less to accumulate. 
It is a special art to restore everything to its former relation 
by a treatment, which makes it appear that nothing has 
happened. 
I. 
Application of Discipline to special ends. 
We must first recapitulate from the third chapter what 7s 
determinable and what determines in moral character. Crude 
desire and volition—what the individual elects to endure, to 
possess, to pursue—are determinable; the ideas of rectitude, 
goodness, inner freedom are determinating. Both these have 
their origin in the whole of the circle of thought, and thus 
depend for their development on the varied movements of the 
mind, the animal instincts as well as the intellectual interests. 
Nothing more, however, now need be said respecting their 
origin, since I have repeatedly expressed my views in many 
ways concerning the formation of the circle of thought. We 
will now rather consider the results of the existent circle of 
thought, how they manifest themselves in a twofold manner, 
 
-P-A-G-E-273
  Moral Strength of Character. 253 
  partly in what is morally determinable, partly in the deter- 
minating volition, and so encounter the limitations and bene- 
ficial influences of discipline. A process of combination lies 
before us, similar to that which gave occasion for a tabular 
synopsis in the second book sketching out the course of in- 
struction. What occasional, what permanent discipline has to 
do to cultivate the spirit of patience, of acquirement, of in- 
dustry, the ideas of rectitude, goodness, and inner freedom, in 
the young man—how they co-operate in their effect on each one 
of these, restraining, determining, regulating, supporting, how both 
give their individual contribution to culture as a whole, espe- 
cially in each of the moral ideas, by preserving a childlike mind, 
by approbation and blame, by admonitions and warnings, by the 
trustful strengthening of moral self-control—to think all this ont, 
link by link, is a task we leave to our readers, or, still better, 
to teachers who are just entering their profession. The reasons 
before given will serve to excuse me from attempting what 
would be but a vague sketch of the interweaving of these 
concepts, but I will content myself with adding, as indicating 
the possibility of such an interweaving, some observations 
bearing upon them in a less systematic way. 
The expression of a true character does not depend on the 
moral fibre of the will alone, but also upon that which in a 
manner shines through it from beneath—what the individual 
would have desired and done, had not the moral determination 
altered the direction of the course of action. Two persons 
may exactly resemble each other in the goodness of their wills, 
but how differently will this goodness translate itself into 
action and effect, if the one has all manner of weak, changeable 
moods, and the other a compact and ordered totality of endea- 
vour, which he can govern in himself by means of the incoming 
moral resolutions. Moral resolve will support itself on the 
latter, and side by side with that which the individual can do, 
with that which he is capable of daring and of conceiving, 
the better choice springs up as choice. From this again pro- 
ceeds a measure of power and promptness, of self-helpfulness 
amidst external obstructions, in aid of moral resolve, which the 
individual could never have created for himself. Tinally,

every man of already decided character goes forward unswerv- 
ing, after each act of self-determination that duty prompts, 
while on the contrary, one whose character is not so estab- 
lished is always making another halt, is always beginning 
again from the beginning, and must continually receive from 
moral considerations an impulse to the most commonplace duty, 
and hence must experience a repugnant mixture of the highest 
with the lowest, which renders both distasteful. 
But how can the desires, how can the choice amongst them 
have been determined and fortified by principles—how can a 
firm plan for external life have been founded, unless this 
choice, these principles, this plan proceeded at the same time 
from that which the individual endeavours to acquire and 
pursue, and continued through that which he is prepared to 
bear and to undertake for it? In one choice all this is co- 
existent, and if industry is not equal to the desires for posses- 
sion, if patience does not endure until the point when it is 
important to use the right moment, then inconsistencies in the 
outer, and division in the inner, life will be inevitable. In such 
complications of that which intrinsically has nothing in common 
with morality, discretion will finally as it were be taken prisoner, 
and then there is an end of that clear and cheerful frame of 
mind, in which alone the good can be seen and perfectly desired. 
And in this way too (moral) good is lost to nations together 
with their prosperity and external order, although the converse, 
that good is created together with prosperity and external 
order is not likewise true. 
Nevertheless the attitudes of mind which embrace the spirit 
of patience, the spirit of acquisitiveness, and the spirit of 
industry, are specifically different from each other. The first 
is yielding ; the second, firm and steadfast ; the third is an ever 
new beginning. The principles of patience are negative, those 
of acquisition positive, both these persistently direct attention 
to the same thing; the principles of industry, on the contrary, 
demand a constant movement of the mental eye from one 
thing to another. 
It seems difficult, therefore, to unite three such diverse atti- 
tudes of mind with pre-eminent energy in one person, and stil!

  more difficult to bring into harmony for a plan of life, that which 
the man desires to endure, to possess, to pursue. It is the 
more difficult, in that a plan of life cannot in reason be some- 
thing entirely concrete. On the contrary only general maxims 
can be contained in it, in accordance with which the man in- 
tends to use possible opportunities, in order to make use of 
special abilities and advantages. However, we will first con- 
sider the particulars, and then the combination. 
There are exercises in patience from youth onwards. The 
smallest child is designed by nature to submit itself to these 
exercises, and only an entirely misguided education, by over- 
indulgence on the one hand and severity on the other, can 
render patience difficult to the child.' We owe to modern 
teachers the careful determination of the right middle course, 
and I may look upon this determination as definitely made. 
There are also abundant opportunities for exercising the spirit 
of acquisitiveness from youth onwards. LHducationally con- 
sidered, this is a far more delicate subject than the preced- 
ing. Imagine, on the one hand, a young child who attaches 
some value to possession, and, on the other, a boy who does 
not know how to keep his pocket-money—this will be sufficient 
to remind us, that while the foundations of thrift must be laid 
early, yet that childlike kindness which is not consistent with 
the exclusion of others, must also be cherished. Without pur- 
suing moral considerations in this place, a glance at child- 
nature shows us, that when a genuine spirit of acquisitiveness, 
(which consists not in a capricious desire of momentary posses- 
sion, but in a continuous adherence thereto, and consequently 
pre-supposes a decided direction of the mind towards one 
point,) shows itself in early years, it indicates a species of 
mental malady, at least a want of animation; for the child 
ought to be far too much occupied with perceptions and ex- 
    
1 We must distinguish between two kinds of patience—active and pas- 
sive—between hardships to be endured in work, and wishes to be denied, 
to be sacrificed. Education must accustom the child to the former, the 
latter however may become harmful. It is often better to take a bold step 
to escape an evil than to suffer it. We must not expose a child to be 
tormented by passive patience; if the latter were always a duty, vitality 
would be destroyed.—Aphor. zur Pédagogik.
-P-A-G-E-276
  256 Science of Education. 
  periments in the world still so new to it, to have time to cling 
to the mere possession of a thing in thought. Instead then of 
designedly producing such a disease, we should rather, when 
it spontaneously shows itself, employ the natural corrective, 
increased incitement to varied occupations. Gradually, how- 
ever, there will be things which the child will be allowed to 
have, on the use of which it will reckon, the withdrawal of which 
it would feel as a permanent loss. Such things may be called 
its own, and the spirit of acquisitiveness allowed to exercise 
itself on them. But it ought not to possess as its own, more 
than what it can mentally grasp. Further, exchange of its 
own with what belongs to others may cause the value of things 
to be impressed upon it. This is a preparation for the time 
when money may be given to the child. In order that the 
feeling of labour in acquiring may be connected with this, 
children should be allowed regularly to earn, but this will miss 
its aim if these small productions are bought, as grandmothers 
frequently buy them, above the market price. Everything 
connected with the possession of honour is analogous to this. 
Ambition in very early years is a malady, which fellow-feeling 
and diversion of thought will cure. But as the natural sense 
of honour gradually and slowly develops with growing powers 
of body and mind, it must be carefully protected and fully 
guarded from deadly mortifications. For men need in life, 
honour as well as the possession of things; he who throws 
either the one or the other away passes in society with justice 
for a prodigal. And everything which educational artifice 
checks and retards in the natural development of care for 
both, causes later either an incurable weakness, or the sud- 
denly awakened feeling springs forth, and surrenders itself 
the more easily to the commonest prejudices. Observe care- 
fully, then, whether a boy is to some extent respected by his 
playfellows, or whether through trivial faults he becomes the 
object of their teasing. In the latter case take him away from 
  1 This principle was followed by the Philanthropinists, especially Salz- 
mann, who in his school at Schnepfenthal provided his pupils with 
various employments, for which they received a small payment.
-P-A-G-E-277
    Moral Strength of Character. 257 
this truly harmful companionship, but without punishing those 
who tease, for they are not worth your resentment ; your educa- 
tional insight must show you what consequences will remain 
behind in the boy intrusted to you. Try to cure his weak- 
nesses, to cultivate his talents more perceptibly, and choose for 
him company in which these talents will be so strongly felt, 
that what on the other hand is found faulty in him will be 
balanced against it. 
Finally, there are always opportunities from childhood up- 
ward for the exercise of industry. We can, we ought, to foster, 
to guide, to watch continuously the earliest employments to 
which the child spontaneously shows itself invited by surround- 
ing objects, and gently and gradually try to lead it to constancy, 
to keep longer to the same object, and pursue the same purpose. 
We may always play with the child, guide it in playing to some- 
thing useful, if we have previously understood the earnestness 
which lies in the child’s play, and the spontaneous efforts with 
which it will work itself out in happy moments, and also if we 
know how to abstain from such condescension as would check 
the child’s upward efforts, for in such upward efforts in the 
childish things which will soon be left behind, it would have 
received instruction, For that instruction which, analytically 
or synthetically, aims at clearness of elementary presentations, 
and therewith commences the essential work of education, we 
should seek in the most direct way to gain the child’s activity. 
Mental activity 1s healthy too! healthy as that of the limbs 
and internal organs; everything will be set in motion together, 
so that the child accomplishes what it can, without exhausting 
any one power. That alone consumes mind and body, which is 
pursued for a long time without interest, yet this does not take 
place so rapidly that we need fear having to conquer the first 
difficulties of what will soon arouse interest. We must accustom 
the child to work of every kind. That which is pre-eminently 
successful, will always impart its own direction to industry. A 
special choice amongst occupations will always call out special 
features in the character and plan of life. 
But this direction of industry must also accommodate itself to 
the wish for possession, and both must arm themselves with 
B
-P-A-G-E-278
  258 Science of Education. 
  the same patience, the same kind of endurance in waiting and 
in suffering, which is pre-eminently required by circumstances, 
for such wishes and such an industry. In doing this the earlier 
education of the child must not be burdened with special kinds 
of training or hardening for a definite position in life. General 
culture by no means gives the boy himself the means of knowing 
what he will choose to become, and of circumscribing his interest 
accordingly. The man of many-sided culture possesses a many- 
sided equipment; his choice may be made late, for he will easily 
attain the necessary skilfulness in any case, and by a later 
choice he will gain infinitely in the certainty of not going 
wrong, from a mistaken conception of his own character, or 
from changeable circumstances. 
We must expect, however, from a clear head and a cultivated 
mind, that a young man’s delayed choice will be adequate to 
unite his inclinations in regard to patience, acquisitiveness and 
activity. For this is the work of an active reflection more than 
of any antecedent practice. Only we must then allow this 
reflection quietly to rule, and carefully guard against disturbing 
the self-determination then beginning by various exacting minor 
considerations, or by the claims of an interminable discipline, 
which may degenerate unconsciously into real cruelty towards 
a sensitive mind. We ought rather to accustom ourselves to 
look out with the young man in his way on the world and on 
the future. 
Here then the assertion that mental culture is the central 
point of all education acquires a new validity. It is only 
men who are allowed to grow up with dull or entirely dis- 
torted minds, or those who are irresponsibly drawn hither 
and thither by the fine threads of youthful susceptibility, who 
are ignorant how to get on with the world and themselves; 
they chafe and beat themselves against the contradictions of 
their own efforts, and finally succumb the more surely to the 
bare necessity of care for subsistence and other social amenities. 
Such sights may seduce the teacher to cram by means of divers 
anxious artifices, the youthful mind with a number of acquire- 
ments for ordinary life, yes, and even by talking of these things, 
to attract the attention of adults and fill the booksellers’ shops.

Where health and the proportions of intellectual interest have 
been cared for, as much judgment and flexibility as a man 
requires to get through life will, in the end, be spontaneously 
forthcoming. But to travel through life with a steady mind 
and firm courage, to be able to practise moral self-control more 
easily, and I might add with more inward grace—to these ends, 
the aid of discipline before described is of service. 
Above all we must not forget, that we have now only spoken 
of the laying of the foundation upon which moral worth is to 
be built up. 
It would indeed be no great task for discipline to cultivate 
the spirit of endurance, of acquisitiveness, and of activity in 
such a manner, that out of all that ought to shine through the 
moral resolves nothing more than a very respectable character, 
alien to morality, would be determined and strengthened. The 
true task of discipline, on the contrary, is to observe and to 
adjust the relation between this kind of cultivation and the 
moral, during the whole course of education. For in truth 
everything here is relative. The decided preponderance ought 
to be on the moral side, but there is a preponderance among 
small as among great weights. With frivolous young people 
both weights remain for a long time small, and a slight pre- 
ponderance finally determines the life. With steady tempera- 
ments, whose attention is drawn in early life to the splendour 
of the good things of this world, very strong ideas of this kind 
are compatible at times with a moral and religious energy 
of nevertheless considerable depth. But how can we begin to 
give rules for the observation of a relation so important ? 
acknowledge my inability, and believe it will be long before the 
practical teacher will be able to share the gain he himself wins 
with any theory. I pass therefore to the second part of this 
relation, which, taken singly, invites me to some remarks, though 
in the absence of practical philosophy they can be but very 
brief. . 
I have named rectitude, goodness, and inward freedom as the 
original manifold, to which the concept of morality in general 
relates through their claim to obedience. It has been already 
mentioned that under the expression rectitude, two specifically 
 
-P-A-G-E-280
  260 Science of Education. 
  diverse practical ideas, entirely independent of each other, are 
comprehended. These two ideas are Right and Equity. In 
order to characterize them, we may take as the motto of right, 
“to every man his own”’—as the motto of equity, “to every man 
what he deserves.” And to convince ourselves that our abortive 
rights of nature have mixed and confused both these claims in 
the strangest manner, we may remember in passing the so-called 
scales of justice, and ask ourselves what the judge would do with 
tiie seales when some one demanded his property back again? 
Or we may reflect a little more seriously on the contradiction, 
‘““summuim jus, summa injuria,’’? to understand that here by the 
expression jus, just as in my expression rectitude, two entirely 
different concepts must doubtless be understood, of which neither 
can be contained or determined by the other. But the same 
reason which up till now has been the cause of a gross confusion 
in practical philosophy, may be a reason for the science of educa- 
tion to combine both diverse ideas. They are generally created 
contemporaneously and by the same circumstances ; they enter 
into the same decisions, and therefore it is not easy to suppose 
that an ingenuous mind which makes its moral insight more 
keen. for the one, will not at the same time do so for the other. 
Mothers who maintain order among their children decide -in- 
numerable times according to both ideas, certainly not always 
without mistakes, and when wrong are generally so, because 
they themselves wish to rule therein too much. 
This leads me to the chief observation which I have to make 
here in relation to the science of education. The great work 
of education, to make the sense of right active early in 
youth, would proceed of itself without difficulty, if combined 
with good discipline and government; the moral perceptions 
which belong thereto would be the first and most natural among 
them all, if children were allowed to accommodate themselves to 
1 «The highest (strictest) right, is the highest (greatest) inequity.” 
Obviously this familiar term ‘* Ungerechtigkeit,’’ probably copied from 
Terence (dicunt, jus summum s#pe summa est malitia) signifies not the 
direct contradictory of right, but only unequitable, so that both concepts of 
right and of equity taken in the negative sense can be combined therein in 
thought as Herbart combined them above in the concept of rectitude.— 
Anmerkung von Karl Richter.

and associate with each other in their own way, and could be 
judiciously left to themselves. For where human. beings, big 
or little, rub against each other, the relationships with which 
those moral perceptions are connected develop abundantly and 
spontaneously. Hach one soon has something individual which 
the others acknowledge ; the children associate with each other 
and exchange things and services at prices more or less fixed. 
The interference of adults, and the anticipation of this possible 
interference alone, makes justice among children uncertain, and 
deprives it of their respect ; well-meaning government has this 
effect in common with every other which is despotic. It is 
obviously impossible to rule children like citizens ; but we may 
lay it down as a principle, never to disturb what exists among 
children without good reasons, nor change their intercourse into 
forced politeness. When disputes arise, we must first ascertain 
what has been settled and agreed upon amongst the children 
themselves, and must take the part of the one who in any sort 
of way has been deprived of his own. Then we must try to 
help each one to what he deserves, so far as this is possible 
without violent injury to justice. And finally we must point 
beyond all this to what is best for the common good, as that to 
which it is right that both property and merit shall be spon- 
taneously sacrificed, and which will be for all the chief measure 
for future agreements. If discipline has got beyond the first 
beginnings, it must never allow the pupil to habituate himself 
to making his right the determining ground of his actions; 
the right of others alone must be for him a strict law. No one 
ought to invent for himself initial right, nor arbitrarily presume 
to interpolate for himself one more reasonable than that which 
exists.! 
The expression, goodness, should call to mind benevolence? It 
—_— ee 
1 The reason why the first place is assigned to rectitude for the formation 
of the objective part of the character is, that the relations of right and 
equity signified by the term are more important than those of benevolence 
and culture, and because, since they occur so numerously in youth, they can 
and ought easily to be understood. 
2 For the further definition of benevolence or good-will see translators’ 
Introduction, p. 29,

is very important to distinguish here two points both of equal 
importance, because they are originally different from, and 
independent of each other, and therefore seldom exist in 
equal strength, and yet are both indispensable if benevo- 
lence is to become a settled feature of character. That 
is to say, it is necessary that a rich measure of good-will 
shall exist as natural feeling in the objective of the character, 
and equally necessary that in the subjective, the idea of good- 
will shall be fostered to maturity as an object of moral 
taste. Philosophers have never assigned the latter its true 
place and rank; only in religious teaching are principles 
enunciated in which nothing is wanting, save quietness, and 
sobriety of refiection. It seems to be a frequent misfortune 
of humanity, that good-will only endures in feeling, and 
disappears in the degree in which the character grows cold 
through discretion. And in fact it is not easy to hold fast 
to the idea of good-will in its purity, as I will explain in 
another place in more detail! That the character should 
not be wanting in good-will as feeling, or goodness of 
heart, will be provided for through an actively aroused sym- 
pathy, the difference between which and benevolence cannot 
here be shown? That discipline may be here at one with 
instruction, let the former see that children feel much with 
each other, that they are companions in joy and sorrow. The 
opposite effect will take place if we allow many chances of 
divided interest among them. But it is one thing to accom- 
pany some joy or pain with sympathy and good-will, another 
thing to comprehend good-will itself! When we begin to 
speak of good-will, the time is come for taste to become 
conscious of approbation, which is the natural result of quiet 
1 Note by Herbart.—Especially the two ideas, good-will and equity, which 
have hitherto been most misunderstood, require most of all, speculative art 
for their proper exhibition. 
2 According to the Alig. prakt. Philosophie, the distinction mentioned 
here between sympathy and benevolence consists in sympathy, as merely 
an involuntary imitation of an alien feeling, whether of joy or pain, being 
only a simple condition of our inner being, while benevolence rests on the 
absolutely pleasing unanimity of our own will with a foreign will, that is 
a relationship of two wills.

contemplation. Paintings embodying benevolent sentiments, 
stories of deeds in which they are manifested, may, by means of 
the most characteristic traits, reach the highest degree of dis- 
tinctness; they must not seek to carry the heart away by emotion 
only, or they destroy the tone of mind in which alone they can 
truly please. If the children’s susceptibility spontaneously 
mingles emotion with the consideration of such things, we may 
enjoy in silent pleasure the welling up of lovable feelings, and 
must forbear from exciting it still more, but break gently off 
and return to seriousness. The emotions will subside, they 
will become rarer with years, yes, they will be laughed at by 
later prudence, relegated to the region of youthful folly, and 
forcibly suppressed by the principles of a circumspect egoism, 
unless taste in its maturity and steadfastness makes head 
against this, and calls forth another wisdom. The ease with 
which benevolent characters begin to be corrupted through 
their own logic, if they remain for a time unwatched, is one of 
the most disagreeable of a teacher’s experiences, though certainly 
one that ought not to be entirely unexpected. In this respect 
the disposition to early manliness, otherwise so excellent, is 
mostly to be feared. 
So far as disposition goes, they who incline to goodness and 
they who incline to inner freedom, appear to be almost opposite 
kinds of ment The good-natured, who can warmly rejoice 
when things go well with others, are wont themselves to love 
comfort, and to give way considerably to manifold changes of 
feeling; the strong whom fate does not bend, and who will not 
hear of bending, are wont only to call those who do bend, weak, 
and coldly to blame them. The antithesis here lies by no means 
in the judgments of taste, whereby the ideas of benevolence and 
of inward freedom are created ; these are entirely independent of 
each other, and just for that reason are neither for nor against 
each other. But it lies in the objective of the character which 
1 Note by Herbart.—I must, however, here beg some readers not to 
identify inner freedom with transcendental freedom. We are all conscious of 
the former whenever we force ourselves to duty against our inclinations ; 
the science of teaching may not know anything of the latter because nothing 
= be built upon it, and my pedagogy ignores it, becatma my philosophy 
rejects it. 
   
-P-A-G-E-284
  264 Science of Education. 
makes the following out of the ideas easy or difficult. Wemay 
call to mind @vpos and érifvpia in Plato. The susceptible 
desiring mind, which perceives in itself many likes and dis- 
likes, possesses in them the principle of a lively sympathy 
and consequently also a rich spring of natural benevolence; 
to this is wont to be added the yielding of the subjective 
to the objective of character, which subjective readily finds 
principles answering to the inclinations.2 The weaker on the 
contrary the susceptibility, and the greater all kinds of activity 
and consciousness of energy, the more capability will there 
be for genuine resolute volition (conformably to what I have 
said before in respect to action as the principle of character), 
and this prepares the ground for volition based upon insight. 
With insight, benevolence as a natural feeling is often not 
at all compatible; on the contrary, it is characteristic of inward 
freedom to follow no natural feeling unconditionally. If then 
the idea of benevolence is wanting, inward freedom will take 
pride in its coldness, and thereby, with perfect justice, will 
shock the warm-hearted and benevolent. So much the more 
necessary is the cultivation of the latter idea. But as for the 
right development of the idea of inner freedom, unfortunately 
it is primarily a philosophical, and only secondarily an educa- 
tional problem, therefore I should run the risk of treating the 
latter vaguely, if 1 here tried to pursue it further. Only we 
must not talk too much to the young man of unity with himself, 
which he himself should settle according to his own inclinations. 
My readers might well anticipate, that from the elements of 
the practical ideas about which I have been silent rather than 
explanatory, many finer definitions for educational instruc- 
tion, especially for the synthetic, would be forthcoming,—that 
amongst others, through them alone the educational nature of the 
reading of Sophocles and Plato after Homer, and of Cicero and 
1 Plato assumed between thought and desire the @uyuds, the energy 
which could act either on the side of reason (Aoyiorixév), or of morality 
(ércOuunrixév), and impart to one or the other the impetus to real activity, 
which, without it, they did not possess; thus it was somewhat similar to 
what was afterwards called ‘ freedom of will.” 
# This refers to the good-natured. 
 
-P-A-G-E-285
    Moral Strength of Character. 265 
  Epictetus, after all these, would be placed in its true light. A 
hint on this point may at any rate present the Odysseus of 
Sophocles in contrast to that of Homer, if there be a desire to 
study the Philoctetus almost immediately after the Odyssey. 
The question also may be asked, what influence the historical 
basis of our positive religion, so important to education, will 
probably have, if acquaintance with the Platonic Socrates, as he 
perhaps discloses himself in the Crito and Apologia, came first, 
and if later the Stoic moral philosophy introduces the study of — 
Kant and Fichte’s modes of presentation. I surely need not 
remind you that it would be entirely unpedagogic, if instead of 
successive concentrations on each one of these systems, we 
tried to make a muddle of all together. To describe circum- 
stantially things of this kind is not the business of the science 
of education; it can only suggest the consideration of what 
would be necessary and useful as answer to its essential 
demands. | 
For the same reason, I must also leave out here the develop- 
ment of what each single one amidst the practical ideas would 
accomplish through instruction adapted primarily to many- 
sidedness of interest. Above all, however, no one will fail 
to notice, that where compassionate sympathy, where all- 
powerful social interest, and finally where a tone of mind 
favourable to taste is aroused and maintained, a number of 
conceptions must be already spontaneously developed, of which 
practical philosophy will only need hereafter to make a concise 
exposition in order to mark out and define still more sharply 
the moral principles. 
By the side of necessary instruction, the teacher's inventive 
power must always be employed in the arrangement and 
utilisation of any opportunities wherein the moral feelings 
show themselves alert and active, and in which they can be 
perfected and exercised. Need I name the best of these oppor- 
tunities—family festivals—of which none ought to escape the 
teacher’s attention and co-operation. Doubtless we should be 
greatly mistaken if we thought the beneficial impressions of 
such times, which exercise enduring influence for many years, 
could exercise any considerable force in later life—if we hoped

  to be able to compose as it were out of similar emotions a 
person’s whole mode of thought. But from the tone of mind in 
which the youth is placed and maintained, the inner working 
out of the gifts of instruction is determined, and upon it are 
contingent the views of experience and knowledge, and the 
force and blending of the early conceptions of eternal truth 
. and goodness. 
Only let not merely scattered opportunities, but, if possible, 
continuous activity also, keep alive the feelings of right, of 
benevolence, and of self-control. For benevolence, such will 
certainly be forthcoming; also for the feelings of right and 
equity opportunities of exercise amongst brothers, sisters, and 
playfellows will arise spontaneously, if not connected yet all 
the more freely, if possession, earning, and the arrangements 
growing out of them are not entirely wanting in this little 
circle, or are not made use of too indiscreetly by discipline. 
Self-control, which makes human beings inwardly free, finds 
abundant opportunity, not only in morality proper, but in 
everything which in any way may be considered as belonging 
to taste. It is not at all necessary here to catch at educa- 
tional devices, no arbitrary aimless sacrifices and burdens are 
needed ; such have nothing in common with inner freedom, for 
| tt consists in the following of insight. But we must quicken 
early and with ever-increasing care the sense of the differences 
between what is for, and what is opposed to, taste; thus a 
number of little duties will arise, ranging upwards from efforts 
after cleanliness and order, to the attention which social 
' relationships require, the observation of which imparts to the 
mind a steady beneficent tension. But precisely in these 
things, discipline must guard against an emphasis of which 
insight cannot approve. It must treat nothing here with 
exaggerated importance, for little things would thereby become 
completely trivial to the ingenuous mind, but rather strive to 
compass everything by gentle restraints. In cases of necessity, 
government must take vigorous measures. But if discipline 
be exchanged for government, if we leave that force to operate 
continually and persistently on all trivial occasions, which, 
used occasionally, makes good again what the children have

spoiled, if that force be given to pressure which belongs only 
to the sudden blow, then we must not be surprised if the power 
of the boy succumbs, if finally the wild untutored youth main- 
tains his superiority to the weakling over-trained. 
The young child is not yet capable of valuing the benefit of 
education. A boy of twelve years, rightly guided from early 
childhood, prizes it above everything from his deep sense of the 
need of guidance. The youth of sixteen begins to take on 
himself the teacher’s work; he has partly appropriated his 
point of view, he accepts it, and marks out for himself his 
course accordingly; he manages himself and compares this self- 
treatment with that which continuously fell to his lot from the 
teacher. It must be so—for he who knows himself best and 
looks through himself most directly, will, at times, see with 
greater clearness, than he who always remains another person. 
It must be so—for he feels himself unnecessarily constrained, 
and his obedience transforms itself more and more into 
forbearance to the benefactor of earlier years. Under this 
forbearance, however, he wishes to suffer as little as possible. 
Then follow efforts to gently throw off the weight of discipline. 
These efforts will multiply in very rapid progression, if on the 
one side the teacher notices nothing, and if on the other the 
pupil does not still often make mistakes, and judgment does 
not fall into his own hands in his own eyes. But in any case 
they multiply. A wrong feeling may now easily possess the 
teacher, impelling him to make an end suddenly. Yet his 
duty will restrain him. He will interfere more rarely, more 
guardedly, and always more ander the presumption that he 
is exercising influence on a fine excitable susceptibility ; he will 
seek to touch the subjective more than the objective of the 
character; he will try to guide not the reins, but the hand 
which holds the reins. Moreover, it is now of supreme 
importance that the principles become perfectly formed and 
purified, which will henceforth rule the life. Instruction, 
therefore, will still continue, after discipline has almost disap- 
peared. But further, instruction no longer touches a merely 
receptive mind; the pupil will himself judge. ‘To the end

that he may examine, he begins by doubting. That he may 
be free from his embarrassing confinement within his habitual 
circle of thought, he enters the sphere of other opposing 
opinions. Little differences of views, which gradually arise 
and have hitherto remained unnoticed, acquire voice and 
growth under the favouring influence of strange impressions, 
to which the charm of novelty gives force. The principles 
become deflected just in the years when the physical side of the 
man and the social relations come to the front with irresistible 
claims. What will now protect the toilsome work of educa- 
tion? What ought to protect it? What, if not its inner right- 
ness, the truth of convictions, the clearness and breadth of the 
intellectual gaze, if not the feeling of mastery over men and 
opinions, and the responsive inward gratitude for that care 
which has rendered such an ascendancy possible? Let_the 
teacher have courage, when he has failed, to see the consequences _ 
of his failures, and also have courage to learn from them, And 
so let the young man, at any rate now that he is grown, hear 
the language of the world. Let time bear him forth to its 
Austen and its revelations, to its troubles and its joys! or 
let him try to influence its changes, to test and to show his 
courage and his power—the courage and power inborn, culti- 
vated, and self-won !

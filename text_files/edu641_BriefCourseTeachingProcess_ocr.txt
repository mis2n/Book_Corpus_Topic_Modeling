PREFACE 
Tus book is the direct outcome of experience in trying 
to help teachers grow in skill in the art of teaching and in 
power to appreciate the work in which they are engaged. In 
the following pages have been treated as concretely as possible 
the problems which the teacher faces day after day in the class- 
room. Theories of education have not been discussed at any 
great length, but rather those processes through which these 
fundamental principles find their expression in actual teaching. 
Terminology which it is difficult for teachers to understand 
has been avoided. Although the results of studies in educa- 
tional psychology and in experimental pedagogy have been 
included in the interpretation of the problems discussed, it 
has not been thought advantageous to discuss at any length 
any one of these investigations. 
Many of the books which have been written for teachers 
have discussed theories of teaching method without indicating 
clearly the application of these principles in typical classroom 
exercises. In other volumes a single type of teaching has been 
emphasized to the exclusion of other equally valid methods 
of instruction. In this book each of the several typical meth- 
ods of instruction has been treated, and the validity of the 
particular practice indicated in terms of the end to be accomp- 
lished, as well as the technique to be used. Since the technique 
of teaching method is not the only element in determining the 
efficiency of the teacher, there is included in this book a 
discussion of those other aspects of the teacher’s work which 
determine the contribution which she makes to the education 
of the children with whom she works.

  viii Preface 
In the chapter on lesson plans are given a number of il- 
lustrations which conform to the types of exercises discussed 
earlier in the book. One of the greatest needs in working 
with teachers is met by this very definite provision for demon- 
strating the validity of the types of teaching discussed. The 
exercises given at the end of each chapter are intended to 
supplement the discussions of the book by calling for an in- 
terpretation of the thought there presented in terms of situa- 
tions with which teachers are commonly familiar. 
To Professors F. M. McMurry, Naomi Norsworthy, and 
L. D. Coffman, each of whom has read the manuscript, I am 
indebted for many valuable suggestions. To Miss Kirchwey of 
the Horace Mann School, Miss Steele and Miss Wright of the 
Speyer School, to Miss Tall, Supervisor of Grammar Grades 
in Baltimore County, Maryland, and to Dr. Lida B. Earhart 
of the New York City Schools, I am indebted for lesson plans. 
The outlines for the study of English, arithmetic, geography, 
and history which are given in the appendix are published

CHAPTER Tf 
THE AIM OF EDUCATION 
Epucation is worth just the difference it makes in the 
activities of the individual who has been educated} The ques- 
tion is not how many books did we compel the child to read; 
how much does he know of arithmetic, geography, history, 
music, art, and the like: but rather what use does he make of 
this knowledge; how is he different from the person who does 
not possess this information; and, still more important, are these 
differences in his activity desirable from the point of view of 
the group in which he lives. It is important, then, that we 
should consider, before we discuss the function of teacher in 
bringing about changes in children, the ends which it is desir- 
able to attain. 
The aim of education has been variously stated. In the 
popular mind the aim of education is usually interpreted in 
terms of knowledge, or the ability to make a living. The 
theorists have been more apt to define the purpose of educa- 
tion in terms of the development of the abilities of the individ- 
ual, of growth, of culture, or of morality. It might be inter- 
esting to examine each of the aims which has been advanced 
in some detail. It may be as significant to note the element 
common to all. 
It is safe to assume that the advocates of each statement of 
aim believed that their conception was broad enough to insure 
success for the individual educated in accordance with the 
particular ideal embodied in their statement of purpose. No 
aim would be at all acceptable which did not take account of 
the society in which the individual must work. The educa- 
B I

tion in a tribal society, which consisted in learning how to 
protect one’s self and to provide for one’s physical needs, 
the acquaintance with tribal ceremonies and tribal lore, quite 
as truly as our modern education, fitted the individual to get 
on in life. The individualistic point of view has been con- 
stantly emphasized. It has been a case of earning a living for 
one’s self, of getting culture for the satisfaction that it might 
bring, of acquiring knowledge for the sake of the advancement 
which was thus made possible, of moral growth for the sake of 
individual salvation. More recently it has been common to 
state the aim of education in terms of social efficiency. It is 
the purpose of this discussion of aim to examine this concept 
in order to make clear its significance. 
When society reaches that stage of development in which 
progress is definitely sought and planned for, the stage of 
conscious evolution, it is not enough that the individual be 
educated simply so that he may attain his own selfish ends. 
Each individual is a part of the organic whole, and in his func- 
tioning it is the good of the whole which is of paramount 
importance. The aim of education must, then, be broad 
enough to include both the welfare of the individual and the 
good of society. Is there any real opposition between these 
ends? If we think most of all of the welfare of the whole or- 
ganism, must we sacrifice the interests of the constituent parts ? 
No one can do the most for the group of which he is a mem- 
ber who has not realized in his education the development of 
those abilities with which he is peculiarly endowed. The 
nurture of those abilities upon which society places a premium, 
and the inhibition of non-social tendencies, means greater 
opportunity for the exercise of whatever strength the indi- 
vidual possesses, greater individual growth and development, 
than would otherwise be possible. It is only through partici- 
pation in social life that the highest individual development 
is possible, and it is true that ‘“‘he who loseth his life” for the 
good of the group “‘shall find it.” There is, then, no opposition   
     
-P-A-G-E-17
  The Aim of Education 8 
bet w of education which declares that the wel- 
far: of paramount importance, and that which 
der al well being. If we are successful in obtain- 
ing e must have secured the latter. 
I of the relation of the individual to society 
is ct ‘ustified in claiming that any adequate state- 
Meme vt une aim of education must point unmistakably to the 
idea of the common good. Education aims so to adjust the 
individual to the group that the welfare of society as a whole 
may be advanced. This adjustment can be brought about 
only through participation in social activities, and thus the aim 
is constantly realized in the process. 
Tn our democratic society, which makes possible free educa- 
tion for all of its members, there can be no question of the 
right of society to demand that education aim to develop men 
and women who work for the common good. It is necessary, 
then, to analyze this aim of social efficiency in terms of our 
society. The equality of opportunity which we profess to 
offer is to be thought of in terms of possible service which may 
be rendered. 
In any community the contribution to the general welfare 
which may be made by any one of its members is conditioned 
by the interests which the individual has in the general good. 
The unsocial individual, the one who seldom responds to the 
needs of the group, is out of sympathy with social problems, 
and contributes little to social welfare. 
But it is not enough that the individual be interested in the 
common welfare. Interest may lead him to do that which is 
harmful rather than helpful, or it may be that his interest may 
have no result except to give him certain pleasurable emotions. 
There must be added to sympathy, knowledge. Interest or 
sympathy in the welfare of society may furnish the propelling 
force, but knowledge is necessary for effective action. The 
world is full of men and women with the best intentions who 
hinder rather than advance the common good.
-P-A-G-E-18
  4 A Brief Course in the Teaching Process 
Since each is responsible not only for his own conduct, but 
also for the welfare of the whole group, it is necessary that our 
education provide opportunity for growth in intelligence. 
Our schools have always emphasized this element in educa- 
tion. We have often defined the aim of education in terms 
of the development of citizenship. Usually the chief quali- 
fication of the citizen has been interpreted to be that knowl- 
edge which would enable him to exercise the right of suffrage 
with intelligence. We do well, however, to remember that 
intelligence must be exercised in all of the activities of life. Our 
education must strive constantly to develop men and women 
who will be rational at all times. But we may not forget that 
our schools have been so much concerned with the intellectual 
side of education that they have tended to neglect other ele- 
ments which are equally significant from the standpoint of 
social welfare. 
There is still another element which must be added, the habit 
of acting on behalf of the group. We all know people who 
know just what is demanded in a given social situation; they 
profess to be interested in the welfare of the group; but they 
never act. When their own private interests are involved 
they are quick to seize the opportunity for improving their 
condition ; but in social matters they are inactive. It isin this 
particular, rather than in any other, that our schools fall short. 
We do much to arouse the sympathy of children in the general 
welfare ; we give them the knowledge by which their action may 
be guided; but we give them little opportunity to form the 
habit of social service. This is due to the fact that we so often 
think of adult social activities as the only ones that are worth 
while, forgetting that for the child the important thing is 
social activity now and in his society, that the only way to 
prepare for adult social effectiveness is to secure social effi- 
ciency on the part of the child. 
These questions still remain: how can we, through educa- 
tion, produce the individual who, because of social sympathy, 
 
-P-A-G-E-19
  
The Aim of Education 5 
knowledge, and activity, will tend to advance the welfare of all; 
and what kinds of education meet the demands of the aim 
which we have set up. 
First of all, we must endeavor to produce the individual who 
is sound physically. Modern education recognizes the fact 
that a man’s usefulness is conditioned by his bodily condition, 
and is also coming to find that physical activity is not without 
its effect on the mental development and life of the individual. 
There is, therefore, one large division of our work which we 
may call physical education. 
On the side of mental development, education consists in 
preserving and stimulating the child’s interest in the materials 
and processes with which he may come in contact. Intellec- 
tual training aims to develop the man or woman who is mentally 
alert, active in investigation, and controlled by reason. It is 
to this intellectual education that our schools have devoted the 
larger part of their time. The school is the agency set aside 
by society for transmitting culture, and the teacher must 
always concern herself largely with the intellectual life of 
children. 
Our modern view of education is leading us to stress, along 
with physical and intellectual education, a kind of training 
which aims to develop the individual whose moral standards 
are positive rather than negative. Moral-social education 
should establish ideals of social service as well as standards of 
individual righteousness. 
Along with physical, moral-social, and intellectual-cultural 
education, there is need for that type of training which will 
enable each individual to do some particular work with a high 
degree of efficiency. This type of education we commonly 
call vocational. It is only recently that we have come to 
realize that it is not enough to train an individual with respect 
to general intelligence and morality, but that it is also just as 
fundamental that our education provide the training necessary 
for success in the particular calling which each individual is
-P-A-G-E-20
  6 A brief Course in the Teaching Process 
to enter. For the preparation of clergymen, doctors, lawyers, 
teachers, and engineers, whose vocations require a maximum 
of intellectual achievement, it is true that we have long had our 
vocational schools. We are coming now to appreciate the 
fact that equality of opportunity demands that special train- 
ing be given to those who are to enter the industries. Indeed, 
our vocational schools must multiply until there is training 
offered for each and every calling before we can claim to pro- 
vide that training which is essential for social efficiency. 
Another problem is that of the training for leisure. In 
society as at present constituted, it is possible for many in- 
dividuals, and it should ultimately be possible for all, to have 
a considerable amount of leisure time. The contribution of 
each individual in his special line of work, and his general 
interest in the whole community, will depend in a considerable 
degree upon the proper use of leisure time. Our education 
must, therefore, attempt to equip men with interests and ideals 
which make for the nobler enjoyments. 
Keeping in mind the sympathetic, wise, active social indi- 
vidual, made so by the process of acquiring experience or 
making of adjustments, both physical and mental, we have yet 
to reduce our aim to the terms of schoolroom practice. What 
can a teacher hope to do in this hour, with this group of children 
to work with ? 
First of all the teacher can work for the formation of 
habits which are socially desirable and for the inhibition of 
those which are undesirable. ‘Education is for behavior, 
and habits are the stuff of which behavior consists.” 1 The 
school may be a very important factor in the formation of 
habits in each of the fields of education mentioned above. 
If the schooi is organized on a rational social basis, it must 
continually present opportunities for actions which should 
become habitual, and the future efficiency of the learner 
depends upon gaining such control of much of the knowledge

The Aim of Education y 
which we teach that the response desired becomes habitual. 
The social virtues of promptness, regularity, helpfulness, 
industry, fidelity, honesty, truthfulness, cleanliness, both 
physical and mental, patriotism, and the like, should be made 
habitual in connection with the situations which demand their 
exercise. The physical habits acquired in childhood are of 
the utmost significance throughout life. Much of arithmetic, 
spelling, writing, geography, history, and even of literature and 
art, will be significant in proportion as we have reduced our 
knowledge to the automatic basis of habit. One cannot stop 
to reason everything out; life is too short. We gain time and 
energy for the higher activities of life in proportion as we 
reduce the responses which occur frequently to the basis of 
habits. In vocational schools one of the chief aims is the for- 
mation of habits of skill. Later we shall want to discuss in 
detail the methodology of habit formation. 
Every teacher recognizes that one of the ends which must 
be achieved by the school is knowledge. We shall not here 
enter into the discussion of the problem of what knowledge is 
of most worth, since for the teacher this choice is usually 
made and prescribed in the course of study. One cannot, 
however, refrain from suggesting that much that is taught 
would be eliminated, if we kept constantly in mind the end 
for which we strive. The following criteria, proposed by Pro- 
fessor Frank M. McMurry, will be suggestive from the stand- 
point of teaching, whether the teacher determines the curricu- 
lum or not. 
“We hold to the following propositions in the rejection of 
subject matter. 
“y, Whatever cannot be shown to have a plain relation to 
some real need of life, whether esthetic, ethical, or utilitarian 
in the narrower sense, must be dropped. 
“2, Whatever is not reasonably within the child’s compre- 
hension. 
1F. M. McMurry, “Advisable Omissions from the Elementary Curriculum,” 
Ed. Rev., May, 1904. 
 
-P-A-G-E-22
  8 A Brief Course in the Teaching Process 
“3. Whatever is unlikely to appeal to his interest ; unless it 
is positively demanded for the first very weighty reason. 
“4. Whatever topics and details are so isolated or irrelevant 
that they fail to be a part of any series or chain of ideas, and 
therefore fail to be necessary for the appreciation of any large 
point. This standard, however, not to apply to the three R’s 
and spelling.” 
’ These criteria indicate clearly that knowledge can never be 
in itself an end of teaching. It is not that the child may have 
knowledge merely, but that he shall have knowledge which 
will function. This knowledge which we seek to have the 
child master will concern his physical life, his social relation- 
ships, his vocation ; and in each field the knowledge he possesses 
will limit his intellectual activity. 
The school must keep alive, or, in some cases, awaken those 
interests which are socially desirable. It is not enough that 
habits have been formed and knowledge acquired. Much of 
the usefulness of the individual after he leaves school will de- 
pend on his interests which lead him to acquire new knowledge, 
or to attempt some new activity. It has sometimes been 
asserted that the school, as at present organized, tends to kill 
rather than to preserve those interests which are common to 
little children. It is probable that the passing interests in 
things due to curiosity must disappear, regardless of the edu- 
cation which we give; but it is a poor sort of education which 
leaves the child without abiding interests which will help him 
not only in making a living, but also in enjoying his life. 
Here, as elsewhere in education, we may be satisfied with the 
result only when we get the corresponding action. That child 
has an interest in good literature who reads good literature. 
We can be sure that the boy is interested in natural phenomena 
when he is willing to spend his leisure time finding out more 
about nature’s ways. The only test that we have of an abid- 
ing interest in the welfare of others is the fact that the child 
is now active on behalf of others. In like manner are we to 
 
-P-A-G-E-23
The Aim of Education 9 
judge of our success in arousing and maintaining those other 
interests which are desirable. 
Judgments of fact are called for constantly in acquiring 
knowledge and in our everyday activity; but no less impor- 
tant in the life of individuals are judgments of worth. Edu- 
cation must concern itself with the ideals, purposes, and stan- 
dards which should be acquired by children. There is no field 
in which greater skill is demanded in teaching than in bringing 
children to appreciate those things which are good, true, and 
beautiful. Ideals, or, for those who do not agree with them, 
prejudices, will always be of tremendous importance. They 
determine the course of action a man will take. Because of 
their ideals men have been willing to labor incessantly for a 
cause which they considered just, to give up personal good in 
the pursuance of public duty, to lose all, if they might but 
retain their honor, yes, even to lose their lives because they 
felt that this extreme service was demanded of them. The 
awakening and nurturing of ideals of work (or industry), of 
honor, of duty, of purity, of service is the greatest contribution 
of the best teacher. 
There is one other aim which the teacher should have con- 
stantly in mind, included possibly in the above, but which 
needs to be stated separately for the sake of emphasis, i.e. 
that children should be taught how to work independently. 
The best teacher is the one who is constantly striving to render 
her services unnecessary. There is nothing that the school 
can do which will take the place of giving the child knowledge 
of the most economical means to be employed in achieving 
desirable ends. Is it a matter of knowledge, the child should 
be made conscious of the methods whereby truth may be es- 
tablished; is it the need of establishing a new habit, or the 
breaking up of the old one, we should make available for the 
pupil the principles of habit formation so that he may apply 
them to his own case ; in matters of right and wrong, the school 
should have supplied standards of reference which will help

in the difficult situation. Possibly the great weakness of many 
teachers in imparting this knowledge of methods of work is 
best illustrated by citing the well-known fact that children of 
high school, or even college age, are found very frequently 
who do not know how to read a book, or study a lesson assigned. 
This problem will be treated in considerable detail when we 
come to consider the study lesson. 
Pupils at work forming habits of thought, feeling, and ac- 
tion; acquiring knowledge of nature and of society; forming 
ideals which make for social well being; and learning in all of 
this work to act independently, to function in the society of 
which they are a part: this is education, and these are the 
goals which we should strive to achieve every day and every 
hour that we teach.

  CHAPTER II 
THE FACTORS CONDITIONING THE TEACHING PROCESS 
Tr it is essential that the teacher approach her work with a 
clear view of the ends which it is desirable for her to achieve, 
it is quite as necessary that she be conscious of the factors 
which condition the teaching process. The school, with its 
limitations and its advantages, the community and home life 
of the child, and, above all else, the child himself, his instincts, 
impulses,‘ and abilities must be the subject of most careful 
study. Much progress has been made in recent years because 
of a better understanding and a more sympathetic attitude 
toward children. ‘Teachers are beginning to see that education 
has its beginning in, and that it is always conditioned by, the 
life of the child outside of the school building. The possibil- 
ities of the school as an institution for the education of children 
are just beginning to be realized. 
While it is true that the school shares with the home, the 
church, and the community at large the education of children, 
no one can fail to recognize the fact that the responsibilities 
and the activities of the school have been very greatly aug- 
mented during the past few decades. Where other institutions 
have lost or have become less effective, the school has gained, 
or has been forced to accept new responsibilities. Changed 
industrial conditions and life in cities have made it impossible 
for the home to continue to hold the important place which it 
once occupied in preparing its members for efficient participa- 
tion in the productive activities. Whether we like it or not, 
we are forced to admit that the church no longer exerts the 
power over the lives and conduct of men that it once did. 
12
-P-A-G-E-27
  The Factors Conditioning the Teaching Process 13 
Along with the specialization of function which is so charac- 
teristic of our modern life, citizenship in our democracy has 
come to require less of that type of participation in public 
affairs which was once a great educative factor in our com- 
munity life. 
As these changes in the effectiveness of other institutions 
have taken place, men have looked to the schools to make 
good the deficiency. The schools have responded to the de- 
mand made upon them. Our curriculum no longer consists of 
the three R’s. Cooking, sewing, gardening, and many other 
kinds of manual work, music, physical training, and fine art 
are already found in our courses of study. We are coming to 
recognize the need for more systematic training in morals and 
civics, and vocational training is being introduced. 
What is the significance of these changes for teachers? 
Is it not true that they must teach whatever is demanded by 
the course of study; and is not this the only difference in the 
teacher’s function brought about by changed conditions? The 
answer is, most emphatically, no. The situation which has 
already made necessary the change in curriculum demands also 
changes in method quite as revolutionary. It is more essen- 
tial to-day than ever before that the school present oppor- 
tunities for codperation and for group work, a chance for pupils 
to work together for common ends, because there is so much 
less demand of this sort made upon children outside of school 
than was formerly the case. We ought to do more than we do 
to develop the independence and the self-reliance which were so 
characteristic of the boy and girl who lived in an environment 
which constantly made heavy demands upon their strength, 
skill, and ingenuity. The responsibility for taking the initia- 
tive, and of measuring the success of one’s efforts by the results 
produced, is all too uncommon in the lives of our children. 
The school must, if it is to adequately meet its enlarged respon- 
sibility, develop those habits of thought and action which 
enable one to get along with his fellows. The school life of the
-P-A-G-E-28
  14 A Brief Course in the Teaching Process 
child must, in so far as this is possible, present such oppor- 
tunities, make such demands, and judge results by standards 
essentially social. The child must learn in school to serve, to 
accept responsibility, and to produce results socially valuable. 
We could do much to increase the efficiency of the school if we 
planned more carefully to have schoolroom activities find their 
application in the homes of children. 
School education begins not with the ignorance of children, 
but with their knowledge. Children come to us with a great 
wealth of experience. Our work as teachers is to enlarge and 
to interpret this experience, to give it greater meaning and 
significance. Can any one question, then, the necessity for 
acquaintance with the life of the child outside of school? 
And this study of the out-of-school environment must continue 
as long as the child is in school, if the teacher’s work is to be 
most effective. It makes a great deal of difference when you 
wish to teach nature study that your children have always 
lived in the city, at a considerable distance from a park. The 
problem of teaching a great commercial center to children liv- 
ing on farms presents some difficulty. But it is not alone 
these more gross differences in the lives of children which de- 
mand our attention. There are differences in ideals, differ- 
ences in social custom, in short, in ways of thinking, feeling, 
and acting, which one must know if one would claim any ade- 
quate knowledge of the child to be taught. Probably the best 
opportunity to gain this intimate knowledge of the lives of 
children whom we teach is to be had in the work with parents 
and older brothers and sisters which should be carried on in the 
school building when the smaller children are not present. The 
school which is a center of community life, a place for study, for 
recreation, for physical development, and for social inter- 
course is the school that is fulfilling its mission in the life of the 
people; and the teacher who works in such a school will know 
her children. 
There is one other responsibility which we as teachers must
-P-A-G-E-29
The Factors Conditioning the Teaching Process 15 
acknowledge which again leads us beyond the schoolroom. We 
should work for the welfare of our children during the time that 
they are not with us. No other body of men and women knows 
the needs of these children better than we do. Our work is 
conditioned by the life of the child before he comes under our 
influence. Our work is ofttime of no effect because of the ad- 
verse conditions outside of the school. What does it matter 
that we try to develop morality in children, when the forces of 
immorality in the streets more than counteract our influence ? 
what does it matter that we strive earnestly to provide hygienic 
conditions for work during five hours of the day, when filth 
and disease are doing their deadly work outside of the school for 
nineteen hours a day? Who knows better than we that chil- 
dren with starved bodies cannot do great things intellectually ? 
If we were only organized to improve these conditions, we could 
do much for the welfare of the community. The time is 
coming when it will be considered as legitimate for a body of 
teachers to discuss the problems of impure food supply, of re- 
lief for the poor, of means for the suppression of vice, and of 
better hygienic conditions for the children of our cities, as it is 
to discuss the problems of method or the organization of school 
work. Whzct we need, if we are to be effective in the work, is 
better organization, more craft consciousness. We now pos- 
sess potentially great power for social betterment. We are 
exercising this power in the school, and, as individuals, outside 
of the school. We will, let us hope, in time, recognize the 
larger social demand and perform the larger social service. 
The children with whom we work come to us equipped with 
many native reactions or tendencies to behave. In any situa- 
tion the child will react in accordance with some native ten- 
dency or habit which has grown out of the original tendency. 
Success in teaching depends upon a recognition of these in- 
stinctive tendencies, the development of some, the grafting 
of new but similar reactions on others, and the inhibition of 
the native reaction and substitution of another in still other
-P-A-G-E-30
  16 A Brief Course in the Teaching Process 
cases. The instincts which are of importance in education 
have been variously named; among these those of greatest 
significance for the work of the teacher are play, constructive- 
ness, imitation, emulation, pugnacity, curiosity, ownership, 
including the collecting instinct, sympathy, wonder. We 
shall deal briefly with each of these in relation to the work of 
the teacher. ; 
Play: Possibly the lesson which teachers need most to 
learn is that play has real educative value. Before the school 
age has been reached, the child has learned chiefly by playing. 
In play the child gets his first experience in those activities 
which are later to make possible a happy, useful life in the com- 
munity. The number of possible reactions possessed by a 
child of six is largely determined by the opportunity he has 
had to play. This is why we value so much a life free from 
restraint, and in contact with nature, for little children. Con- 
tact with the trees, the rocks, the birds, the flowers, and asso- 
ciation with other children mean possibilities of learning for the 
child which no amount of instruction or exercise of authority 
can equal. The child plays now with this object and again 
with that; and in consequence comes to know not only the 
objects, but his own power. In an imaginative way he expe- 
riences all of the adult activities about him, sowing, reaping, 
building, cooking, cleaning, hauling, fighting; and he is wiser 
and better prepared for the period of struggle, which must 
come later, because of these activities. 
Nor should this period of play end when the child enters 
school. The skillful teacher makes a game of many of the 
exercises of the school, which might be otherwise drudgery. 
The desire to win is common to children six years of age, and 
many a hard task will become play, if the element of compe- 
tition is introduced and sufficient variety in procedure is 
provided for. By playing, children may learn to work. Te 
achieve the ends desired in a game may involve the overcom- 
ing of difficulties which require the most earnest effort. There
-P-A-G-E-31
  The Factors Conditioning the Teaching Process 17 
can be no better preparation for life than the playing of games 
where team work, self-restraint, and fairness are demanded. 
We need more careful study on the part of teachers of chil- 
dren’s games, and more planning that all may secure the bene- 
fits which come from this sort of activity. In the school- 
room, wherever it is possible, the spirit of play should pervade 
the work. There will be cases enough where results will de- 
pend upon the exercise of authority. Let us never forget that 
the reaction of play may mean just as valuable results as 
the reaction of necessity, and that the ideal life is the one in 
which all work is play. 
Constructiveness: Closely connected with the play instinct 
is the instinct to make out of the material at one’s command 
that which will represent some element in the play. In the 
beginning, gestures, sounds, and whatever objects are present 
suffice in the make-believe world of the child. But soon the 
materials are rearranged or shaped into some new form in order 
to represent the object desired. Materials become to the 
child just what he can make out of them. And it is not simply 
in power to construct or to represent that the child grows 
because of this activity. To make something, to work out in 
materials one’s idea, means growth in definiteness and control 
of ideas. The one adequate test of ideas must always be some 
sort of expression; and, for the adult as well as for the child, 
construction is one of the most important forms of expression. 
We would gain much in all of our school work in clearness and 
definiteness, if we resorted oftener to construction as a test. 
Of course, construction is not to be limited to the making of 
things of three dimensions. The map, plan, or artistic repre- 
sentation belongs to the same group, and is developed from the 
same instinctive tendency. 
Just one more word of caution needs to be given with regard 
to work of thiskind. In constructive work, whether with wood 
or clay, or with pencil or brush, the point of departure should 
be the child’s idea, not the model or pattern provided by an 
Cc 
 
-P-A-G-E-32
  18 <A Brief Course in the Teaching Process 
adult. After the child has made his attempt, then let him 
see where he has failed by reference to the object which he has 
tried to represent. And we can afford to be satisfied in the 
beginning with a crude product, so long as it satisfies the child. 
As for technique, there will come a time when the desire for a 
better product will call for greater skill and will furnish the 
very best possible motive for the necessary practice. 
Imitation: In both play and constructive work a most 
important element is the instinct to imitate. The child con- 
stantly imitates adult activities in play, and in construction 
he represents the objects about him. As has already been indi- 
cated, it is in this way that he clarifies his ideas, that he gains 
experience. In imitation, which is truly instructive, the child 
does not consciously plan to imitate; it is enough that the 
model is present. This kind of imitation is sometimes called 
spontaneous imitation, in contradistinction to the other type 
of imitation, in which the individual persistently tries to repro- 
duce the activity of another. In the latter case he is conscious 
of the process ; and this type is sometimes called voluntary imi- 
tation. This distinction is important for teachers in many 
phases of school work. There are cases where the only satis- 
factory response is that which accords with the model, the 
standard which society imposes. We do not want a child to 
try to spell a word without being conscious of the form com- 
monly accepted. He will succeed in spelling because he has 
studied this word, or is able to build it up from his knowledge 
of its constituent parts. On the other hand, wherever creative 
work is to be done, wherever originality is required, the edu- 
cational value of the exercise is inversely proportioned to the 
degree in which conscious imitation of a model has entered 
to produce the result. In such subjects as English composi- 
tion, constructive work, science work involving observation 
and experiment, what we want above all else is the attempt 
on the part of the learner to express his own ideas; and it is 
only after this expression that any adequate appreciation of 
model or of criticism can be hoped for.
-P-A-G-E-33
  The Factors Conditioning the Teaching Process 19 
There is one other factor in connection with imitation which 
is of great importance in teaching ; namely, that children per- 
sistently imitate what they admire. This has a double signifi- 
cance for the teacher. Those things which can be made less 
attractive will tend to be less imitated ; and, conversely, that 
which is held up as worthy of great respect will be much imi- 
tated. If we were only wise, we would devote our attention 
to the leader of the group, trying to secure the appropriate or 
desired reaction upon his or her part, rather than devoting 
ourselves equally to the whole group. We can depend upon 
it, the crowd will follow the leader whom they admire. Our 
appeals often mean little to children, and the models which we 
set up have little effect, because, however admirable these 
standards may seem to us, they are beyond the power of chil- 
dren to comprehend or admire. Instead of giving a boy a letter 
of Jefferson as a model, better give him the one written by his 
classmate. Do not expect the girl to imitate the noblest 
women in history, but make your appeal on the basis of the 
virtue of the girl she likes. 
Emulation: Much that has been said above under imitation 
might quite as well have been written under the head of emu- 
lation. As social beings, we tend to do what others do. Con- 
sciousness of kind compels us to lay great store upon our ability 
to do as others do. When in Rome the difficult thing is not 
to do “‘as Romans do,” but to do otherwise. The desire to do 
not only as well as others, but to accomplish more, is respon- 
sible for much that is achieved in the world. If we did not 
have others with whom we are constantly comparing our- 
selves, few of us would do as well as we now do. Rivalry will 
always be one of the greatest means of bringing about im- 
provement or advancement in social conditions. In school, as 
well as in the world at large, rivalry, if kept free from jealousy 
and envy, will justify its existence by the results produced. 
The boy or girl who is anxious to distance his fellows in school 
is apt to be the man of ambition and of success in later life. 
 
-P-A-G-E-34
  20 «=A Brief Course in the Teaching Process 
Pugnacity: More prominent in boys than in girls, but present 
in some degree in every individual, is the instinct to fight, 
the desire not to be overcome either by persons or conditions 
which surround us. In so far as this instinct leads to physi- 
cal encounter, for all except the unusually strong physically, 
the correction comes by way of defeat. For all, the substi- 
tution of games which involve physical prowess for fighting, 
and the substitution of victories of intellect for the victories 
of physical combat, point to the utilization of this instinct in 
education. It is sometimes possible to appeal to this in- 
stinct when discouragement and defeat in school tasks seem 
inevitable. No boy likes to be told that he has been downed 
by the task in long division, or that he has failed to make good 
in spelling or geography. The whole world hates a~quitter, 
and normal, healthy children are no exception to the rule. 
Curiosity: Children are proverbially curious about things. 
They want to know more, to enlarge and make more definite 
their experience. This desire shows itself in their actions in 
handling materials, in making and unmaking, in questions 
asked, in reasoning, in play, and in imitating others. The most 
striking characteristicin the mental life of childrenis the breadth 
of theirinterests, due to this instinct of curiosity. Mostadults 
think along very narrow and restricted lines; not so with chil- 
dren. While it is true that they do little abstract thinking, 
there is scarcely an object or an action which comes within the 
range of their senses that is not followed by the desire to find 
out more. 
Children have the spirit of inquiry, have many problems, in 
short, are mentally active to a degree most uncommon among 
adults. The problem of the teacher is how to keep alive this 
spirit of inquiry, how to insure a continuance of this mental 
alertness. Much of our school work has certainly tended in 
the opposite direction. Reciting what is written in books, 
without thought or question, has too often been characteristic of 
recitations. The appeal to authority, whether of the teacher or 
 
-P-A-G-E-35
  The Factors Conditioning the Teaching Process 21 
of the book, instead of the appeal to experience, to observa 
tion and experiment, or to other methods of establishing truth, 
tends to kill rather than to strengthen the spirit of inquiry. 
We should place greater value upon the intelligent question 
than upon the parrot-like answer. Respect for the problems 
of children, even when they seem of little account to us, rather 
than ridicule or evasion, will tend to keep alive this most 
precious heritage. Of course it is not wise to encourage the 
scatter-brained boy or girl who never thinks about the same 
thing for two minutes in succession. One great function of 
the teacher is to help children to concentrate upon the main 
issue, to show a child that his question is irrelevant to the prob- 
lem under consideration, and to guide him on the path which 
makes thinking pleasant and profitable. 
It would be a good thing for every teacher to ask herself 
whether while under her direction the children whom she 
teaches are usually mentally alert, thinking, asking questions, 
or whether they concern themselves only with repeating the 
thoughts of others. If there be any doubt with regard to the 
children’s natural aptitude, let her observe them when out of 
school and contrast the result. Mental laziness is a habit 
acquired in spite of our initial advantage, in spite of our desire 
for knowledge and the pleasure which comes from thinking. 
The school and the teacher must always be judged by their 
success in keeping children awake mentally; for it is power to 
learn rather than knowledge which counts in later years, and 
learning is most of all dependent wpon the initial impulses 
toward inquiry. 
Ownership: Very early in the life of the child the idea of 
personal ownership develops. There can be no doubt con- 
cerning the importance of this instinct in its effect upon the 
achievements of men, but we are concerned chiefly, in dealing 
with children, with one aspect of this tendency which is com- 
monly known as the collecting instinct. This desire to have 
the most complete collection of buttons, postage stamps, pic-
-P-A-G-E-36
  22 A Brief Course in the Teaching Process 
tures, birds’ eggs, shells, arrowheads, or whatever else it may 
be, may often be utilized to great advantage. [Illustrative 
material for work in history, geography, nature study, and ta 
some degree for other subjects can be had in this way. Sucha 
collection will mean not only a much greater interest in the 
work, but also a livelier appreciation of the subject, more 
images upon which to base its generalizations. I have never 
seen a class that learned more geography in a short time than 
was mastered by a class who followed the American fleet 
around the world, collecting pictures, products, and stamps for 
each of the countries visited, and writing a full account of the 
country visited to accompany these illustrations. Another 
class made most interesting collections in connection with their 
study of colonial history. It is a mistake to suppose that ready- 
made collections will answer the same purpose. They may 
illustrate better, but the added interest and enthusiasm growing 
out of the exercise of the collecting instinct will be wanting. 
The collecting instinct may be utilized in work which deals 
with ideas rather than things. Children may be just as keen 
in collecting ideas about a subject in which they are much 
interested as in making their collection of stones, or birds. 
The transition from the one type of collecting to the other is 
apparent, in collections which are interesting mainly for the 
ideas which they suggest. 
The Social Instinct: The school has often overemphasized 
the individualistic point of view. Competition is a legitimate 
motive; but if all of school life centers around this motive, the 
child has lost much in the non-exercise of that peculiarly human 
instinct which demands codperation and sympathy. At the 
foundation of our society is the idea of working together for the 
common good. Boys and girls who are to be most useful to 
their fellows, who are to do the most for society, 7.e. those who 
are truly educated, must have kept alive and developed this 
spirit, more than altruistic, which sees in the good of society 
the greatest individual gain. In a later chapter this topic will
-P-A-G-E-37
  The Factors Conditioning the Teaching Process 23 
be dealt with in considerable detail; suffice it to say here that 
many opportunities should be found for group projects, for 
service on the part of each member of the group of the sort 
that he is particularly qualified to render. 
Wonder: The instinct of wonder or awe, closely related to 
or possibly identified with the religious instinct, is one that 
our modern critically scientific attitude tends to discourage. 
No one who has had the experience can doubt the value of this 
element in mental life. To wonder at the glory of the heavens 
will doubtless make more difference in the lives of most men 
and women than the smattering of astronomy they may ac- 
quire. Theman who wonders at themanifestation of the power 
of the forces of nature may get more real joy out of life than 
he who feels that he has solved all of her mysteries. We are 
not as a people remarkable for our reverence. It may be 
well urged that our schools have often been responsible for the 
opposite attitude. This instinct of wonder will thrive only in 
a sympathetic atmosphere. No teacher can directly inculcate 
or develop it. Only that teacher who has preserved and nur- 
tured the instinct in her own life can hope to be effective in 
keeping alive the same spirit in children. 
In the first chapter it was claimed that teachers should work 
to develop the socially sympathetic, intelligent, and active 
individual, and that the ends to be expected from any exer- 
cises might be classified as habits, knowledge, interests, ideals 
or appreciations, and methods.of work. In our discussion of 
the native reactions of children, we have endeavored to show 
that the possibilities of such accomplishment are the common 
possession of normal children. It is for the teacher who would 
accomplish these ends most economically to discover the in- 
stinctive basis for the habit to be formed, the knowledge to be 
acquired, interest to beawakened, or appreciation to bearoused. 
The instinctive interests of children will furnish the most power- 
ful motives, and will serve as a basis for the most lasting results. 
Even when the native reaction is undesirable, the successful 
 
-P-A-G-E-38
  24 A Brief Course in the Teaching Process 
process may depend not merely upon negation, but upon a 
grafting upon the original tendency of one that is socially desir- 
able; or, in other cases, the substitution of another reaction 
based upon some other instinctive tendency. We may not 
always follow where instinct seems to lead, but we can never 
ignore these native tendencies. Whether we blindly ignore or 
attempt to work against nature, or wisely utilize the instincts, 
the fact remains that all of our work is conditioned by the 
native equipment. 
It has become more or less the fashion in recent years to 
decry the theory of those who discuss the teaching process 
from the standpoint of the child’s native tendencies, and with 
due regard to his interests. The reactionary who continually 
harks back to the good old times is still with us. The term of 
ridicule most commonly used in lieu of argument is “soft 
pedagogy.” We are told that the only way to develop men 
and women of strength is to begin by making sure that we make 
our appeal on the basis of our superior authority, or even brute 
strength, instead of finding the foundation for our work in the 
instinctive curiosity and tendency to mental activity with 
which children come to us. It is presumed by those who argue 
on the side of the importance of authority that, unless children 
are compelled by others to do hard tasks, they will never 
attempt anything that involves effort. Again, they interpret 
interest to mean the blind following of the child’s instinctive 
tendencies. 
In our previous discussion we endeavored to show that edu- 
cation concerns itself quite as much with the inhibition of unde- 
sirable tendencies as with the encouragement of those which 
lead to desirable activity. The process is not one of following 
where children lead, but rather of availing ourselves of the 
native tendencies in order that the ends we desire to achieve 
may be accomplished with the least waste of time or energy. 
In reality, the choice between the two positions is not whether 
we will have regard for childish instincts and capacities, but
-P-A-G-E-39
  The Factors Conditioning the Teaching Process 25 
rather whether we shall approach our task from the standpoint 
of one who has faith in an appeal to the lower motive of fear, 
or whether we believe that children are best prepared for later 
activity who work out their own problems. 
The best teaching can never consist in driving pupils to tasks 
which they do not understand and which have little significance 
for them. The standard of efficiency is found in ability to 
present to the child a need, a purpose, or a problem which 
solicits his attention. It may be that we shall be but imper- 
fectly able to accomplish this result, but, nevertheless, this 
must be our ideal. And it is not for reasons of sentiment that 
we adopt it. The learning processis explained in this way only. 
We make a new adjustment, reconstruct our experience only 
in a situation which makes such a demand upon us. When a 
child is compelled to do a piece of school work without realiz- 
ing the significance of that which he does, there is substituted 
for this realization of need or probleman artificial need; namely, 
to avoid an unpleasant consequence. 
There is another important argument which must not be 
overlooked. When a child works under compulsion, he usu- 
ally gives just as little attention to his work as may be neces- 
sary to escape painful results. It is not uncommon for children 
to divide their attention most skillfully between distasteful 
school tasks and the out-of-school activities in which they are 
vitally interested. This lack of undivided attention to the 
work in hand results in a habit of work which cannot fail to 
be disastrous to the highest intellectual attainment. It is 
true also that children who have been subjected to such treat- 
ment come to look upon books and lessons as something of a 
nightmare, and are only too glad when the opportunity pre- 
sents itself to leave school and go to work. The child’s atti- 
tude, growing out of his school experience, is quite as important 
as any result which we may achieve in knowledge. 
Professor Dewey’s summary of the relation of interest and 
effort defines most adequately interest in its true significance, 
LIBRARY, 
     
-P-A-G-E-40
  26 A Brief Course in the Teaching Process 
and indicates the place of effort in educative process. He 
says : — 
“Genuine interest in education is the accompaniment of the 
identification, through action, of the self with some object or 
idea, because of the necessity of that object or idea for the 
maintenance of self-expression. Effort, in the sense in which it 
may be opposed to interest, implies a separation between the 
self and the fact to be mastered or the task to be performed, 
and sets up an habitual division of activities. Externally, 
we have mechanical habits with no psychical end or value: 
Internally, we have random energy or mind-wandering, a se- 
quence of ideas with no end at all because not brought to a 
focus in action. Interest, in the sense in which it is opposed 
to effort, means simply an excitation of the sense organ to give 
pleasure, resulting in strain on one side and listlessness on the 
other. 
“But when we recognize there are certain powers within 
the child urgent for development, needing to be acted upon, in 
order to secure their own due efficiency and discipline, we have 
a firm basis upon which to build. Effort arises normally in 
the attempt to give full operation, and thus growth and comple- 
tion, to these powers. Adequately to act upon these impulses 
involves seriousness, absorption, definiteness of purpose, and 
results in formation of steadiness and persistent habit in the 
service of worthy ends. But this effort never degenerates into 
drudgery, nor mere strain of dead lift, because interest abides 
—the self is concerned throughout.” ! 
Interest, as Professor Dewey defines it, is intrinsic. The 
pupil does his work not because he hopes to escape some punish- 
ment or get a high mark, but because the work of itself 
commands his attention. The teacher must constantly choose 
whether she will work for interest of this type, which depends 
upon the recognition of the worth of the task to be performed, 
or resort to an interest which has no relation to the work ta

The Factors Conditioning the Teaching Process 27 
be done. Shall she appeal to the child through his instinctive 
delight in finding out, in constructive work, or other form of 
expression, or shall she appeal to his instinct of fear of a whip- 
ping or dislike of ridicule or nagging ? 
It is true that, after the teacher has done her best to appeal 
on the basis of the child’s needs for growth and development, 
not all children will respond equally, and so, as in the 
larger society outside of school, the child will need to be kept 
from interfering with others, and required to do that which 
those who are wiser have decided that it is advantageous for 
him to do. But this resort to authority, an acknowledgment 
of lack of ability on our part or the result of unfavorable con- 
ditions, must come last; it should never be the point of de- 
parture. 
There is one other distinction which it is well to keep in 
mind when we think of interest. Our discussion thus far has 
considered interest as a means for securing certain desirable 
ends. We may not forget that to secure interest which will 
persist in many of the types of activity found in the school 
should be considered as an end worthy in itself.1 We may 
hope to have a boy interested in his history lesson in order that 
he may gain the knowledge contained in this subject. In- 
terest is the means we employ to secure the desired result. 
On the other hand, we may hope that the boy we teach will 
continue to be interested in history throughout his life. In 
this latter case the interest which we hope to secure in history 
becomes an end for which we work. Asa result of any system 
of education, we are justified in expecting, not only an increase 
in the command of facts and in a knowledge of the best method 
of procedure in working in subjects taught, but also in hoping 
for the development of lasting interests which will make for 
a continuance of the period of education and for greater joy 
in life. 
Heredity in Education: An inquiry into opposing theories 
1 Thorndike, Principles of Teaching, Chapter V.
-P-A-G-E-42
  28 A Brief Course in the Teaching Process 
of heredity is not relevant to our main purpose; but we are 
concerned with certain facts, commonly accepted, which con- 
dition our work. No one will dispute the fact that the children 
assembled in any schoolroom differ in native capacity, as well 
as in experience. Whether genius or its lack are apt to be 
reproduced in the children of gifted or dull parents is not the 
question the teacher has to solve. For her the demand is 
too often that she turn out a uniform product from a group 
of individuals who range from the genius to the dullard or 
mental defective. It is well for teachers to realize that in any 
non-selected group the majority of individuals may be ex- 
pected to be of ordinary ability, and that a few will range 
above this standard, and a few will fall below. The important 
thing to remember is that a group of normal children cannot 
be ranged in ability in two or three distinct groups with clearly 
defined boundaries, but that if any adequate test be given, we 
will find that they distribute themselves over a wide range, with 
small rather than large differences between individuals. For 
example: if a searching test in fundamental operations of arith- 
metic is given, we know that some child will probably get 
nearly all of the work done correctly, and, even with our care 
in grading, some child in the group will probably fail in more 
than half of the work; and that between these two extremes 
we will have almost every grade of ability represented, with 
a tendency for a considerable number to group themselves at 
about that point which we consider ordinary or average ability. 
Not only is it true that individuals differ in ability of any 
particular sort, but it is also true that the child who has little 
ability in one direction may be up to the average or have more 
than usual ability in some other direction. In our teaching 
we should have a minimum standard of efficiency for all who 
are not mentally defective, and we should strive earnestly to 
have all reach this goal. If wisely selected, this minimum

Thorndike, Educational Psychology, Chapter VIII.

The Factors Conditioning the Teaching Process 29 
will include that which is absolutely necessary for further 
advancement along the line of work pursued. The majority 
of the class should achieve results beyond this minimum, and 
for the exceptionally bright child the maximum should be 
fixed only by the child’s ability and the requirements of good 
health. It is useless to attempt to make all alike; it is wrong 
to limit the accomplishment of the gifted by the capacity of 
the majority; these are the lessons which the consideration of 
the capacities of any group of children should teach. We 
cannot furnish ability, but we may create an attitude of list- 
lessness and mental laziness, if we do not give the bright child 
enough to do. Education demands a recognition of peculiar 
abilities and their nurture. We can never create genius from 
mediocre ability, and we may not assume that genius is irre- 
pressible.

  CHAPTER III 
THE TEACHING PROCESS 
EpucatIoN means change, growth, development. The 
process is one of adjustment in which the individual is not only 
affected by his environment, but is also capable, in turn, of 
changing or even in a measure creating the situation in which 
he lives. The experience of any individual grows in meaning 
and significance through successive demands for new adjust- 
ments. Among the lower animal forms there are those who 
have very little power of adjustment; regardless of the situa- 
tion presented, they can react only in one way, or, as the animal 
structure increases in complexity, in a very few ways. The 
power of adjustment being small, the possibilities of learning 
and of education are small. As has already been indicated 
in our discussion of instincts, human beings are equipped with 
many tendencies to react, and with power to react in a very 
great variety of ways. Man has power beyond all other 
animals to profit by experience, and is distinguished from them 
by his power to learn by means of ideas, not simply by the 
process of trial and error. Our problem is, then, to inquire 
concerning the conditions under which a situation demands 
adjustment, under which experience is reconstructed, and, 
further, to discuss the manner in which socially desirable 
reactions may be made the permanent possession of the learner, 
while those inimical to social welfare are eliminated. 
In general adjustments are made in response to one of the 
following situations: (1) when satisfaction of some instinctive 
need results; (2) when satisfaction of an idea of an end to be 
reached, the attainment of which will satisfy some instinctive 
or acquired need, results ; (3) when satisfaction of an acquired 
32
-P-A-G-E-47
  The Teaching Process 33 
need, functioning at the time the adjustment is made, is the 
immediate result. In these cases a type of adjustment not 
instinctively demanded and not originally in itself pleasing 
reaches a point where it is in itself satisfying. The value of 
the experience is intrinsic. 
Little need be said concerning the first class of adjustments 
in addition to our discussion of instincts in the previous chap- 
ter. When one finds himself in a situation which threatens 
bodily harm, he instinctively tries to get out of the way. In 
the presence of materials, children instinctively handle them, 
or make a noise with them, or attempt to construct something. 
The schoolboy, with his questions, his collection of stamps, 
his adherence to his gang, is making adjustments which satisfy 
instinctive needs. 
Under the second class are included reactions in which the 
satisfaction of the instinctive need is not the immediate result, 
and those cases where satisfaction may be explained only by 
reference to an acquired need. The essential characteristic 
of this class of adjustments is the fact that the idea intervenes. 
It is for the satisfaction of our idea of an end which may be 
remote for which the adjustment is made. A pupil may try 
to read well because he has the idea that reading well pleases 
the teacher. The end desired may be simply to get along with 
the teacher without the discomfort of a scolding, or because 
of his instinctive desire for praise. A boy may labor diligently 
in building a sled because of his idea of the pleasure which will 
result to himself or possibly to others. A group of children 
may save their pennies to buy books, instead of satisfying their 
desire for candy, because of their idea of satisfaction to be 
derived from the books to be bought. A man may endure 
many hardships because of his idea of future wealth, political 
preferment, fame, or other good which he hopes will result. 
After a time activities which were stimulated by the idea 
of a satisfactory end to be achieved may be repeated for their 
own sake. This gives us our third class of adjustments. The 
D i
-P-A-G-E-48
  34 A Brief Course in the Teaching Process 
boy may find it very difficult to spend five hours a day with 
books, while the man finds his chief delight in this form of 
activity, altogether aside from a result beyond his present 
satisfaction. A child may begin to read because of the au- 
thority of the teacher and his fear of unpleasant consequences, 
and yet may later come to find great delight in reading. In 
teaching we should strive to bring as many as possible of the 
adjustments to be made under this last category. The boy 
or girl who finds his greatest satisfaction in making the ad- 
justments, in gaining the experience, in doing the work that 
the school provides, is getting the best possible preparation for 
the life of the man or woman who finds his own greatest joy 
in his everyday activity. We need not be discouraged be- 
cause of the seeming impossibility of the task, since its achieve- 
ment would indicate perfection, toward which we strive, and 
which, because it is perfection, we never achieve. Adjust- 
ments are to be made, experiences must be had; and ourappeal, 
whether based upon the satisfaction of instinctive tendencies, 
the idea of ends near or remote, or the satisfaction of acquired 
needs which are socially advantageous, must be the highest 
appeal which can now be made with the assurance that the 
resulting reaction will be secured. 
There is one point which all of these situations which call 
for adjustment have in common; that is, satisfaction. This 
fact is fundamental in teaching. Not only are we limited in 
our work by native tendencies and capacities, but the results 
must give satisfaction, else the reaction induced will tend not 
to be repeated. Of course satisfaction or pleasure is a relative 
term; possibly it would be fairer to say that the individual 
reacts in the way which will result in the least dissatisfaction 
or pain. A boy may dislike to write in a copybook, but he 
may prefer that to a whipping or to being kept after school. 
There is one other possible misconception which must be guarded 
against. That which theindividual considers most satisfactory 
may not be best for his well-being, nor for the welfare of others
-P-A-G-E-49
  
The Teaching Process 35 
with whom he associates. It is the work of the teacher to 
encourage adjustments which are socially desirable, and to 
make unpleasant the results which are socially disadvantageous, 
even though they originally gave satisfaction to the individual. 
Corresponding to the types of adjustment mentioned above 
are the types of attention. When the adjustment is made in 
response to an instinctive tendency to react, we have what is 
called passive or involuntary attention. The boy who looks 
at the door when it opens, who makes a paper boat instead of 
doing his work in arithmetic, or who talks to his neighbor 
about the ball game they are to play after school, is passive so 
far as any attempt to control his mental activities is concerned. 
He is following the line of least resistance. He does not will 
to make these adjustments, or to attend to these things; 
hence we say that he attends involuntarily, that he is passive 
in the situation. 
A second type of attention is that in which the individual 
makes an adjustment, follows a given line of activity, volun- 
tarily. He is active in his determination to accomplish certain 
ends, and in order to secure these results he resists the ten- 
dency to wander, to give his attention to other elements in the 
situation which may be natively more attractive. This type 
of attention we call active. We have this type of attention 
wherever the individual works for the satisfaction of his idea 
of an end worthy to be accomplished. It corresponds to the 
second class of adjustments mentioned above. 
Through the exercise of active attention over a considerable 
period, the necessity for effort, for the exercise of the will in 
order that we may not wander from the main purpose, be- 
comes less and less, until finally a passive attitude is again 
reached. This type of attention is designated as secondary 
passive attention.' It corresponds to the third type of ad- 
justments named above. 
1For this classification of attention, see Titchener, Primer of Psychology, 
Chapter V. 
   
-P-A-G-E-50
  36 A Brief Course in the Teaching Process 
In teaching, we begin most frequently with passive atten- 
tion; we work most earnestly to secure and to hold active 
attention ; and if our work is successful, children will reach the 
stage of secondary passive attention, at least with reference to 
some of the activities found in the school. 
In the first grade, in the beginning reading class, the teacher 
appeals to the children on the basis of their instinctive delight 
in movement, their desire to be like or to excel others, their 
pleasure in drawing with pencil or crayon, their love of a good 
story, and other like instinctive tendencies to react. The ad- 
justments made are in response to instinctive needs, and the 
attention is largelypassive. Gradually, asthe work progresses, 
the ends to be achieved will become more remote, and instead 
of immediate satisfaction of instinctive needs, the children 
will work for the satisfaction of their ideas of ends which are 
desirable, whether based on instinctive or acquired needs. 
They may work diligently in the phonic or word drill because 
they have the idea that this must be done in order to read the 
story, and the end ultimately to be satisfied may be to give 
pleasure to others. The adjustment is made here in response to 
the idea of an end to be secured, which represents the satis- 
faction of a need which probably has been acquired in the 
school or at home. Later in the history of these same children 
they may read, overcoming whatever difficulties may present 
themselves, simply because this process is for them in itself 
worth while. Here we have the adjustment which gives im- 
mediate satisfaction of an acquired need, and the type of at- 
tention which has been designated as secondary passive. 
The problem for the teacher is to secure continued attention 
to one thing. Almost any exercise which the school offers 
will be interesting for a brief time because it is something new. 
The difficult task is not to get attention, but to holdit. Chil- 
dren attend to the situation at hand just as long as it proves 
more attractive than some other. The boy who is called in- 
attentive may be most attentive to the plan he is making to
-P-A-G-E-51
The Teaching Process 37 
earn money to go to the circus. The teacher must endeavor 
to discover ends sufficiently attractive to command the active 
attention of children for a considerable period. The child 
must be willing to exert himself, and the motive for his effort 
must be strong enough to bring him back to the task in hand 
every time that he tends to wander. Often the success of the 
work will depend upon a recognition of the fact that it is very 
difficult to attend for any considerable period to a situation 
in which the elements do not vary. We may secure continued 
concentrated attention by recognizing the fact that variety 
in procedure, or in appeal, will make it possible for the child 
to keep his attention fixed. Take, for example, a topic in 
geography. The teacher will question to bring out different 
aspects of a topic, show the children pictures or use illus- 
trative materials, have children read the map, tell a story or 
incident relating to the situation under consideration, and in 
this manner keep children actively thinking on one topic for 
half an hour. We shall discuss at some length the problem 
of aim, in connection with the inductive development lesson. 
Suffice to say here that often we fail to secure the continued 
attention of children because we ask them to attend to that 
which for them lacks interest or significance. 
Children work hardest when the problem to be solved is 
one that they recognize as their own. Theymake adjustments 
which mean immediate satisfaction, or which they believe will 
ultimately give satisfaction. Our difficulty is often that the 
end we set up is too remote. The idea of becoming a well 
educated man will not ordinarily be powerful enough to keep a 
boy at work on a composition, but the desire to be the author of 
a paragraph in the school paper, to write to a boy in another 
city or country, or to compose part of a drama which the class 
will act for their friends, may mean the hardest sort of work, the 
most concentrated attention of which he is capable. 
The children with whom we work come to us with tendencies 
to react, and are capable of reacting in a great variety of ways.
-P-A-G-E-52
  38 A Brief Course in the Teaching Process 
They learn by making adjustments to a great variety of situa: 
tions. The teaching process consists in providing the situa- 
tions and the stimuli to action, in guiding the individual in 
such a way that the undesirable reactions will be eliminated by 
disuse or because the results are unpleasant, in making per- 
manent desirable native reactions or those which have been 
grafted upon or derived from them by making the results 
pleasant. 
The teaching process is, in general, as described above; 
but the actual work of the teacher varies greatly as she strives 
now for one end and again for another. There is a methodology 
of habit formation which the teacher must command if she is 
to do successful work in equipping her pupils with desirable 
habits. If our problem is one that lends itself to the inductive 
method, we have one sort of procedure; while if the thinking 
involved is deductive, certain other elements enter. There isa 
kind of work in which we aim primarily for appreciation, and 
at another time we are chiefly concerned in teaching children 
how to study. The proper conduct of a review or examination, 
and the type of exercise commonly known as a recitation lesson, 
need to be discussed in some detail. In the chapters which 
immediately follow, each of these types of schoolroom exercises 
will be considered. Success in teaching consists quite as much 
in working definitely for well defined ends which may be ac- 
complished in this fifteen minutes, this half hour, or during this 
week, as in keeping in mind the more general aims of education. 
Indeed, the only way in which we can secure the larger ends is 
by successfully achieving the lesser tasks. The teacher who 
knows that she has fixed this desirable habit of thought, feel- 
ing, or action, that this bit of knowledge has taken its place in a 
usable system, that this ideal or purpose has been awakened, 
that certain methods of work are available for the group of 
children whom she is teaching, that teacher can be sure 
that she is fulfilling her mission.

accomplish this result. In some schools this type of work has 
been overemphasized, while in others it has been neglected. 
It is a mistake to spend the whole of a child’s time and energy 
drilling him upon that which some one else has thought. He 
must think for himself while a child, if he is to show intellec- 
tual strength as a man. And it is just as much a mistake to 
believe that the greatest progress in thought or action can be 
achieved without careful attention to the formation of desir- 
able habits. Probably there is little need to-day to argue 
against this conception of teaching, which makes the teacher 
simply and solely a drill master. Our respect for the native 
tendencies and for the experiences of children, our emphasis 
upon doing, our belief that the best preparation for future 
efficiency is to be found in present childish efficiency, all refute 
any such narrow view of the educative process. There is, 
however, in some quarters a danger that this insistence upon 
thinking and doing may be construed to mean that drill work 
is no longer necessary. There are children who are terribly 
handicapped in their later work because they have not learned 
to spell common words, to write a legible hand, to give without 
hesitation the addition combinations, to reproduce the multi- 
plication tables, to use without much thought the processes 
commonly employed in arithmetic work. They find difficulty 
in reading, because they lack that knowledge of phonetics 
which would make easy the recognition of unfamiliar words in 
41 
 
-P-A-G-E-56
  42 <A Brief Course in the Teaching Process 
their reading; they stumble in geography, fail in music, lack 
ability to comprehend their work in nature study or history, 
all because facts essential to further progress, once presented 
and understood, were not reduced to an automatic basis by 
carefully conducted drill exercises. If it is clear that much of 
the knowledge which children acquire must be reduced to the 
basis of habit, we may next inquire just how this drill work is 
to be related to the other part of the school work. 
Question of motive: In the formation of habits not provided 
for by native tendencies to react, the occasion for making the 
adjustment is, as in the case of our thinking, the recognition 
of a need. Our first attempts to talk or to use our limbs were 
due solely to the compelling force of instinct, but later we 
learned a foreign language or achieved success in the high 
jump because wé had a definite aim in mind. So far as the 
teacher is concerned with habit formation, she can hope to 
utilize instinctive tendencies, but may not depend upon them 
alone to secure the result. A motive must be provided for the 
work. The stronger this incentive, the greater will be the 
attention given to the work in hand and the sooner will the 
desired result be secured. Very much of the drill work which 
is done is well-nigh futile because it is imposed upon children. 
They do not see its significance, and feel little interest in the 
accomplishment of the results demanded. 
Ideally, drill lessons should come when the children see that 
their future progress is conditioned by successful formation 
of the habits involved. And this is not so impossible of ac- 
complishment as might appear at first sight. If the material 
given to children to read in the first grade is of such a nature 
that they really care to read it, they are very quick to see that 
word drill, and later phonetic drill, will help them to secure 
the end desired. Of course the reply may be made: “What 
is the use of bothering one’s self with this attempt to make a 
rational appeal to children? They will be completely satisfied 
if you simply keep them at it. It is a game for them. They
-P-A-G-E-57
    The Drill Lesson 43 
enjoy it simply because they delight in accomplishment.” 
One might reply to such a statement by calling to mind the 
fact that the school exists to develop rationality. You may be 
perfectly sure that frequently enough the children, and later 
the men and women, will be driven or led without any appeal 
to reason. It will undoubtedly be true that we shall have to 
appeal to motives other than rational ; but surely this appeal 
to reason should be made, and, if our education is successful, 
should be increasingly potent as we advance from grade to 
grade. Even when a rational motive has been made the point 
of departure, we shall have to use many devices to keep alive 
the child’s original intention. But let us frankly admit, both 
to ourselves and to the children, that these subsidiary aims are 
merely aids in helping us to achieve the more worthy aim. If 
such a standard of motive were applied throughout our work, 
we should probably find it necessary to postpone certain ac- 
tivities which we insist upon for no reason which a child can 
understand, until there was some real use for the habit to be 
formed. We might even find ourselves compelled to eliminate 
much which finds no application in real life. The occasion for 
drill is found in the demand for automatic control of thought or 
action, and much of the later success of the children in think- 
ing and doing will be conditioned by the quality of the work 
done in these drill exercises. 
Knowing what to do: A clear idea of the result to be accom- 
plished is, of course, involved in the notion or aim as it has 
been discussed above. The importance of this element in 
habit formation cannot be overemphasized. It may seem 
superfluous to call attention to the fact that every child should 
have a clear idea of what is to be done before the drill work 
begins ; but it sometimes happens that the teacher takes too 
much for granted. Children stumble and fail, or do nothing 
at all, simply because they do not know what it is all about. 
It would seem impossible that any group of pupils should be 
asked to commit to memory anything which they did not un- 
 
-P-A-G-E-58
  44 <A Brief Course in the Teaching Process 
derstand, and yet we are constantly reminded by their later 
interpretations that they have not understood. Such logical 
organization is not always possible, nor, indeed, even desirable, 
as, for example, in learning addition combinations. In such 
a case the value of the habit is largely due to the fact that we 
no longer attempt to rationalize the process nor attempt to 
fix it in a logical series. But whether the task be the memoriz- 
ing of a poem, the learning of addition combinations, the 
formation of the habit of neatness, or the gaining of skill in 
handling a saw, it is essential that the child know just what is 
to be done and that he be provided with an adequate motive 
for doing it. 
Repetition with attention: After a child knows what to do, 
has the right idea, and the greatest possible motive for doing 
has been provided, the teacher’s problem consists in keeping 
alive the desire to achieve the result while the process of repeti- 
tion is going on. A child learns to spell a word not simply 
because he repeats the letters or writes them in the correct order 
ahundred times. We all have knowledge of cases in which this 
sort of repetition has seemingly resulted in no advancement. 
The most economical method of learning to spell requires that 
the maximum of attention be given while the letters are re- 
peated. The story of the boy who, after he had written after 
‘school the phrase “I have gone” a hundred times, wrote at 
the bottom of his paper for the information of the teacher, who 
had left the room, “I have went home,” isa casein point. The 
trouble with this boy was not that he had not repeated the 
correct form often enough, but that he had not attended to it. 
He had failed to realize the significance of what he was doing. 
Doubtless his attention, instead of being fixed on the work in 
hand, was more largely given to the game of baseball his com- 
panions were playing, or to the prospect of the delights of the 
swimming pool. Much of the concert work that one hears 
shows a lack of attention on the part of the larger part of the 
class except in so far as is necessary to follow the leaders.
-P-A-G-E-59
  
The Drill Lesson 45 
Such work is undoubtedly helpful to those who lead, but it is 
of little use to the others who take part. It is a very good 
plan to test concert work by listening closely to distinguish 
those who are carrying the burden, have them stop, and 
measure the success of the work by the result which can then 
be had. 
Means of holding attention: No matter how strong the 
motive with which we start, any one of us will grow weary 
when the task imposed requires many repetitions. It is even 
more difficult for children to keep their attention fixed for 
any considerable length of time. We must, therefore, plan 
carefully to conduct the drill in such a way that the maximum 
of attention may be secured. Among the devices which are 
employed, one of the most important is variation in procedure. 
Suppose, for example, we wish to spend ten minutes in drilling 
children on addition combinations. The best results will not 
be secured by spending the whole time in either oral or written 
work. Probably the maximum of attention and consequently 
of result could be secured by dividing the period into three 
parts: one devoted to oral work, holding every one respon- 
sible for every answer ; one to written work on a series of prob- 
lems provided on number cards or mimeographed sheets; and 
one to work of the same sort placed on the blackboard. Of 
course there is nothing peculiarly good in the order of exer- . 
cises suggested above, beyond the fact that they give variety. 
The next day the teacher would want to change the order or 
to, introduce a new type of exercise. 
Another means of securing the maximum of attention is to 
place a time limit. Have the children see how many problems 
they can solve, how many stanzas they can commit to memory, 
or how many words they can learn to spell in a period of ten 
minutes. It makes a very great difference whether the teacher 
says “work on this task for ten minutes,” or “‘see how much 
you can get done in ten minutes.” 
This leads us to consider a third means commonly employed
-P-A-G-E-60
  46 <A Brief Course in the Teaching Process 
to secure earnest work, the appeal to emulation. The desire 
of a pupil to do as well as other members of his class, or the 
desire of a class to equal the record of another class of the same 
grade, will do much to keep attention fixed on the work. 
Neither the devices mentioned nor any others will avail unless 
the teacher is wide-awake and alert herself. The greatest 
single reason for lack of interest and attention on the part of 
the class is found in the indifference and lack of energy on the 
part of the teacher. It is useless to expect vigorous action on 
the part of pupils, when the teacher is half asleep or otherwise 
either physically or mentally incapacitated for good work. It 
is possible at times for a teacher to arouse her own flagging 
interest by just such appeals as have been suggested above as 
applying to children. 
Necessity for accuracy in practice: Our nervous system 
is so constructed that to do anything once leaves a tendency 
to do the same thing the same way when next we are placed 
in a similar situation. It is bad to allow careless work or 
random guessing, not simply because the result in this one case 
may be wrong, but more especially because the tendency to the 
wrong reaction is there and must be overcome before the cor- 
rect action can be fixed as a habit. If a child, the day after 
he has studied the word foreign, has occasion to write the word 
and does not know how to spell it, it is a mistake to permit the 
word to be written incorrectly. It would be better to have 
the child discover for himself or find out from the teacher the 
correct form before attempting to write the word. It is well 
to insist on the necessity for absolute accuracy. Better by 
far discontinue the drill while every one is still fresh enough 
to give close attention to the work in hand and while the re- 
sponses are accurate, than to make the serious mistake of 
allowing the work to be done carelessly or to flatter one’s self 
that approximately accurate results are good enough. Better 
be sure that in the drill work on the multiplication table to-day 
the children have invariably given the correct response when we
-P-A-G-E-61
  The Drill Lesson 47 
have asked them how many are six times three and six times 
four, than to have attempted to teach the whole table with the 
knowledge that one fourth of the answers have been wrong. 
We should not be misled; the child who gave us a wrong 
answer is not simply wrong this time, but, what for us is 
more important, will tend to be wrong ever after. We have 
more than doubled the task we set out to accomplish. We 
must now get rid of the tendency to give the wrong answer, and 
then teach the correct one. In our later consideration of the 
moral life of the child, we shall have occasion again to point 
out the significance of this principle. 
The periods elapsing between repetitions or series of repetitions 
should be gradually lengthened: The fixing of a habit so that it 
shall always thereafter be available to determine our thought 
or action requires that we do more than arrive at a point where 
the response can be readily secured in a given situation. The 
word which your pupils spell so readily, the table which they 
recite so glibly, the poem which they have so completely mas- 
tered, will apparently have completely disappeared next week 
or next month. Of course the work you have done is not 
without effect. It will be easier to learn the word, table, or 
poem again. But the child should command these results for 
which we labored now. There is a body of knowledge, a group 
of actions, which ought to be available automatically at any 
time. If we are to succeed in fixing this body of habits, if they 
are to be made permanently available, we must recognize the 
fact that when we have first secured the result desired we have 
only begun the process. The boy who recites Lincoln’s 
Gettysburg Address without any mistakes to-day has made a 
good beginning; but if that address is worth remembering 
always, he must recite it several times during the next week, 
and go over it again next month, next term, and next year. 
There will come a time, depending upon his native retentive- 
hess and upon his method of memorizing, when it will no longer 
be necessary to repeat it for the sake of fixing the address in 
 
-P-A-G-E-62
  48 A Brief Course in the Te caching Process 
memory. It will not take a great deal of time to recall that 
which we believe we have fixed permanently last week or last 
month, and by doing this we shall add greatly to the probabil- 
ity of possible recall a year or ten years from now, and inci- 
dentally discover, much to our surprise, how much has already 
escaped. 
Teachers often unconsciously follow the cramming method 
in their attempt to have children advance rapidly ; and, as is 
always the case when this method is employed, what has appar- 
ently been learned is soon forgotten. Fortunately for all con- 
cerned, many of the responses which need to be reduced to an 
automatic basis are demanded over and over again as the child 
progresses from grade to grade, and are thus provided for. 
But much that is now lost could be retained, and each succeed- 
ing teacher could accomplish more than is now customary, if 
only this principle of habit formation were commonly observed. 
In the case of a series of responses to be made automatic, be 
careful to include each member of the series: Much of our work 
is weak because it lacks system. If we are engaged in teaching 
addition combinations, we should be absolutely certain that 
we have taught every possible combination. If we want to be 
sure that children know how to write numbers up to one mil- 
lion, we must have given them drill on all of the possible diffi- 
culties. If children are always to respond correctly when 
problems involving two steps in reasoning are presented, we 
must have been careful to provide for the purpose of drill all 
of the combinations of situations involving addition, multipli- 
cation, subtraction, and division which can occur. For any 
other similar field, the same care must be exercised. 
The greater part of the time should be spent in drilling upon 
that part of the work which presents special difficulty: ‘There 
is no use in spending one’s time equally on all of the words 
included in any list. Some of them can probably be spelled 
with little or no drill, while others may require very careful 
study and many repetitions. In any other field the same
-P-A-G-E-63
  The Drill Lesson 49 
situation will be found. Many of the responses desired will 
be reduced to the basis of habit readily, and a few will require 
continued attention. It is the function of the teacher to dis- 
cover these special difficulties as soon as possible, to clear up 
any obscurity in ideas which may stand in the way, and then 
to drill with special reference to these special cases. 
Briefly summarized, it is the function of the teacher in guid- 
ing pupils in the formation of habits to see to it that they have 
the correct idea of the thing to be done; to secure the maximum 
of motive and to maintain the maximum of attention during 
the process; to guard against carelessness and lapses by 
insisting upon the accuracy or the adequacy of the responses ; 
to provide occasion for repetitions from time to time with 
gradually lengthened intervals; to be careful not to omit any 
of a group or series of responses equally important; to spend 
the greater part of the time and energy of both herself and 
pupils upon those cases which present special difficulty.

  CHAPTER V 
THE INDUCTIVE LESSON 
WE are skeptical to-day of that sort of teaching which aims 
mainly to equip children with a body of accepted knowledge in 
order that they may some time find use for this body of informa- 
tion in later life. We emphasize, rather, the control of mental 
activity which makes for the discovery of truth and the avoid- 
ance oferror. Thinking of this sort is purposeful. We control 
or direct our ideas toward some end, toward the solution of some 
problem. One great purpose of teaching must be to provide 
the opportunity and the stimulus for this kind of thinking. 
We may not be able to lay down any fixed order of procedure, 
nor to devise any set of rules whereby children may be trained 
to be good reasoners; but we can consider what is involved 
in the process, point out the possibilities of interference, and 
suggest some of the means to be employed in encouraging this 
type of mental activity on the part of children. In this 
chapter we shall confine ourselves to that type of reasoning 
which we call inductive. This type of schoolroom exercise 
has usually been treated as composed of five steps; namely, 
preparation, presentation, comparison and abstraction, gener- 
alization, and application. We shall employ this classification 
to guide us in our discussion of the process. 
Preparation: To prepare a child to reason in a given situa- 
tion from the data in hand to the conclusions which must of 
necessity follow, it is first of all necessary that he should see 
that the situation presents a problem. We reason only when 
we have some aim or purpose which can be satisfied by the 
process. But if consciousness of aim or problem is at the 
foundation of this type of thinking, and if we are to deal with 
5$t 
 
-P-A-G-E-66
  52 A Brief Course in the Teaching Process 
children in groups, it is essential that the situation which in 
volves the problem be made the common possession of all. 
The step of preparation presents these two problems to the 
teacher: (x) to find a basis in experience already had, or to 
provide the experience which involves the problem to be con- 
sidered; (2) to make the children feel the necessity for the 
solution, z.e. to make the problem vital to them. 
In considering the necessity for common experience as a 
basis for discovering the problem to children, we are dealing 
with the principle of apperception. Briefly stated, it is this, — 
that any object or situation has meaning for us only as it 
connects itself with and is interpreted by our previous experi- 
ence. Suppose, for example, that a group of first-grade chil- 
dren were asked to tell what made seeds grow. It is possible 
that some of them would not know, could not interpret from 
past experience, the meaning of seeds. If the class were at 
work in a large city, we could be sure that many had never been 
conscious that growing plants had any connection with seeds, 
and there would be few, if any, who had ever noticed the condi- 
tions under which such growth takes place. The first problem 
for the teacher in this case would be solved only when, through 
recall of past experiences, observations, or experiments, the 
experience “seeds growing” became the common possession 
of the group. This is an extreme case, one in which the expe- 
rience which involves the problem is entirely wanting. At the 
other end of the series, we may have a problem for considera- 
tion, the basis for which is found in experiences common to all 
children. But even though this be the case, there will still be 
need for the recall of the experience and for making prominent 
some factor heretofore unnoticed before the children will be 
ready to reason. We may suppose that all children have had 
experience with streets or roads, but we shall want to recall 
many of these experiences in order to make significant the prob- 
lem of transportation which we wish to consider in the class 
in home geography.
-P-A-G-E-67
  The Inductive Lesson 53 
The step of preparation has only partially accomplished 
its purpose when the experience necessary to the realization of 
the problem has been recalled or provided. Still greater skill 
is required in making the child conscious of the problem. In- 
deed, it may well be argued that in the curriculum as it is at 
present organized, very many of the problems that we ask chil- 
dren to solve are problems for them only because we, as teach- 
ers, require that that certain piece of work be done. Often 
the child’s problem consists mainly in avoiding, as far as pos- 
sible, the work which we require, which has little or no signifi- 
cance for him. Children would do much more thinking if we 
were only more careful to give them childish problems to solve. 
Too frequently the organization of knowledge which we impose 
is influenced exclusively by our adult logical conceptions. 
Not that children should be illogical, but rather that child 
logic and the child’s ability to reason depend upon his abil- 
ity to appreciate problems, upon his experience, and upon his 
ability to interpret that experience. When we impose our 
adult point of view upon him, when we ask him to take our 
problem and with the data that we supply ask him to work out 
our solution, whatever else may be said of the exercise, it may 
not be called an exercise in reasoning by children. 
If we do respect the child’s experience and point of view, the 
task still remains of making all of the group of children we 
teach conscious of the aim as their problem. There is no greater 
test of teaching skill than this. Can the teacher, after having 
brought to mind the experiences which are relevant to the work 
she wishes the children to do, make them conscious of a lack 
in this experience; can she awaken the need for further con- 
sideration of past experience and a desire to reconstruct and 
to amplify it? In proportion as she is able to accomplish this 
result, we may be sure that children are reasoning upon prob- 
lems which are vital to them, and that the motive has been 
provided which will secure the maximum of controlled intel- 
lectual activity on their part. The best single test of the
-P-A-G-E-68
  54 A Brief Course in the Teaching Process 
accomplishment of this ideal is to require that the statement 
of aim be made by the children themselves as a result of the 
guidance we have given. This conception of the meaning and 
significance of the aim suggests the solution of the difficulty 
which some people find in harmonizing the idea of instruction 
with the doctrine of self-activity. 
Instruction, when properly conducted, does not impose the 
ideas, the problems, or the conclusions of adults upon children. 
Rather we are concerned in instruction with the child’s expe- 
rience, his tendency to react, his need of adjustment; and our 
function as teachers is to guide him, to stimulate him to his 
own best efforts, to insure the maximum of self-activity while 
we guide this activity toward the accomplishment of ends which 
are desirable. The difficulty is, of course, that the problem 
for solution at any given time may not be equally vital to 
every member of the group. Here is where the element of con- 
trol enters somewhat in opposition to the self-activity of the 
individual. But this condition of affairs is necessarily true 
both in school and out of it, for society sets up for us certain 
norms or standards of experience which must be realized by all, 
and we must for the sake of economy handle children in groups. 
If the problem is not beyond the child’s comprehension, if it 
deals with situations which are significant to him, if the solu- 
tion derived has some bearing on his future action, if he has 
carefully scrutinized his experience in the light of the problem 
stated and has brought to bear those elements which are sig- 
nificant for its solution, we may be confident that the activ- 
ity resulting is closely akin to that which is found in the con- 
trolled thinking of men the world over. 
In order that it may be more easy for children to focus their 
attention upon the problem in hand, there is considerable 
advantage in a clear, concise, concrete, and preferably a brief 
statement of the aim.!_ A problem is half solved when one can 
state it clearly. So long as the problem is not sufficiently well 
1 McMurry, Method of the Recitation, Chapter VI.
-P-A-G-E-69
  The Inductive Lesson 55 
defined to admit of accurate statement on the part of pupils, 
there is danger that there may be much wandering in its con- 
sideration. One of the great lessons to be taught in work of 
this sort is the need of examining the ideas as they suggest 
themselves to see whether or not they are relevant. 
The. argument as it has been stated above points to the 
statement of aim as the culmination of the step of preparation. 
This does not mean that a considerable period must always 
elapse in the conduct of an exercise of this type before the aim 
can be stated. There are occasions, and when the teaching 
has been good they should be frequent, when the lesson should 
begin with the statement of the problem discovered in a pre- 
vious lesson and made clear in the assignment of work. In 
other cases the same aim may hold for several days; 7.e. until 
the problem is solved. In general, as we advance through the 
grades, the ends for which children work should become rela- 
tively more remote, and the achievement of these ends should 
require a longer period of work. There is an advantage in 
setting up subsidiary aims which will make steps of progress in 
the realization of the larger purpose. 
Another distinction that it is well to keep in mind concerns 
the development of intellectual interests on the part of chil- 
dren. The characteristic aim for a first-grade child may make 
its appeal chiefly to his desire for satisfaction, which has little 
intellectual significance ; but education fails if it does not make 
for an increase of interest in intellectual activity. For ex- 
ample, a first-grade boy may be led to count because he wants 
to be able to tell how many marbles he has, or how to measure 
the materials he uses in constructive work; while the mathe- 
matician may work night and day upon a problem of mathe- 
matics because of a purely speculative interest in the result. 
We may not hope to produce the great mathematician in the 
elementary school, but we may hope after a certain point has 
been reached in our study of arithmetic that a boy will recog- 
nize the necessity for drill in addition simply because he

realizes that in the ordinary affairs of life this knowledge is 
required. 
Presentation: The full realization of the problem to be solved 
involves a consideration of data already at hand in experience. 
When we have the problem clearly in mind, we examine this 
experience more carefully to see what bearing it may have 
upon the solution, or we gather further data, observe more 
critically or more extensively, or experiment in such a manner 
as to involve the solution of our problem. What is the func- 
tion of the teacher during this part of the process? There is 
no single answer to this question. Sometimes the work of the 
teacher will consist almost wholly in helping children to recall 
their past experience and to apply it to the question at hand. 
At another time, when experience is lacking, the teacher must 
direct children to the sources of data, guide them in their 
observations or experiments, or even give them outright all 
of the data that she can bring to bear on the situation. It will 
not always be economical to wait for children to gather the data 
for themselves, just as it is not always feasible to require them 
to reach conclusions for themselves. There are times when 
the best teaching consists in demonstration, and occasions 
arise when the only feasible course for the teacher is to liter- 
ally flood the children with data from which they may draw 
their conclusions. 
Again the problem of gathering data becomes the problem 
of memory. We want children to think, and we should insist 
that they gather facts with reference to the solution of some 
problem ; but the solution may not always be immediate. We 
may suspend judgment while we gather further facts and 
organize them. The facts gathered for one purpose, when 
rearranged with reference to a new problem, take on a new 
meaning. If this be true, we may not in our zeal for clear 
thinking neglect the tools with which we work. There may be 
some people who have a great many facts and who reason little, 
but no one can reason without data. Our ability to think
-P-A-G-E-71
  The Inductive Lesson 57 
logically upon any topic is conditioned by our ability to see 
facts in new relations, to reorganize our data with reference 
to new problems; but facts we must have, and a memory 
stored with facts is one of the greatest aids to thinking. 
One of the means mentioned above for the gathering of data 
was observation. It is necessary that we appreciate the fact 
that observation involves something more than having the 
thing present to the senses. Our observations are significant 
for our thinking when we have clearly in view the problem 
which the observations are to help solve. Teachers some- 
times make the mistake of supposing that when children have 
objects with which to work they have a problem. It is not 
unusual to hear teachers speak of objective work as concrete 
work. Now the concreteness of a situation is not at all de- 
pendent upon the presence of objects. Logically a situation 
may be concrete, and yet present.no objects to the senses. On 
the other hand, objects may be: present, children may be 
directed to use them, and yet in the absence of any real prob- 
lem the work done may be of the most abstract sort. Objects 
help to make a situation concrete when the problem under 
consideration demands their presence, or when they help to 
make clear the situation under consideration. For example, 
children may have peas or beans in solving problems in addi- 
tion; they serve to present objectively the reality which is 
symbolized by the teacher or pupils in their written work, 
but this does not make the work in addition concrete. The 
concreteness of these exercises will depend upon the need which 
children feel of the ability to find the sum of two or more num- 
bers. The beans will be significant, beyond their use as ob- 
jects, to illustrate the one-to-one correspondence between sym- 
bolic representation and reality, only if the problem of summa- 
tion which at that time engages their attention concerns the sum 
of certain numbers of beans. Indeed, it may be claimed that 
the use of one set of objects continuously to illustrate a process 
in arithmetic hinders rather than helps the child in his ability
-P-A-G-E-72
  58 <A Brief Course in the Teaching Process 
to reason in this situation, since he may come to consider this 
chance relationship of beans and addition as essential. He 
may think that he ought always to add when he is given beans. 
A good illustration of the necessity for a well defined prob- 
lem for guidance when observations are to be made is found 
in the futility of much work that is done, or rather left undone, 
when children are taken on excursions. The directions which 
follow for the conduct of excursions are those which should 
be followed whenever work in observation is required, those 
which have reference to the handling of a large group of chil- 
dren in the field being added. 
1. The teacher must have clearly defined in her own mind 
the purpose of the observation. If the teacher has not defi- 
nitely formulated the problem, the observation of the chil- 
dren will surely be purposeless. 
2. It is not enough that the teacher know just what data 
she expects the children to gather toward the solution of a 
particular problem; she must know exactly what data are 
available under the conditions governing the observation. 
3. The preliminary work must have prepared children for 
their observations by giving them very definite problems to 
solve. Often it will be advantageous to have these problems 
written in notebooks. 
4. Children not only need to want to see, but also need to 
be directed while they are observing. Nothing is easier than 
to look and not see that which is essential. 
5. It is always advisable to test the success of the obser- 
vations while they are being made. There is nothing more 
difficult than to correct a misconception growing out of care- 
less or inadequate observations. 
6. It is well to remember that not merely number of ob- 
servations counts in the solution of a problem. It is rather 
observations under varying conditions which give weight to 
our conclusions. One intensive observation may be worth 
a thousand careless ones.
-P-A-G-E-73
  The Inductive Lesson 59 
7. When children are taken on excursions, great care must 
be exercised to keep them under proper guidance and control. 
The organization of children into smaller groups with leaders 
who are made responsible for their proper observance of direc- 
tions will help. These leaders should have been over the 
ground with the teacher before the excursion. The assistance 
of parents, teachers, or of older pupils will at times be neces- 
sary. 
8. There should be definite work periods during the ex- 
cursion, just as in the schoolroom or laboratory. 
9. A whistle, as a signal for assembling at one point, will 
help in out-of-door work, provided it is clearly understood 
that this signal must be obeyed immediately, and under all 
circumstances. 
Comparison and abstraction: With the problem clearly 
defined and the data provided, the next step consists of com- 
parison and the resulting abstraction of the element present in 
all of the cases which makes for the solution of the problem. 
In the ordinary course of our thinking the sequence is as fol- 
lows: We find ourselves in a situation which presents a prob- 
lem which demands an adjustment; we make a guess or for- 
mulate an hypothesis which furnishes the basis for our work 
in attempting to solve the problem; we gather data in the light 
of the hypothesis assumed, which, through comparison and 
abstraction, leads us to believe our hypothesis correct or false ; 
if the hypothesis seems justified by the data gathered, it is 
further tested or verified by an appeal to experience; i.e. we 
endeavor to see whether our conclusion holds in all cases; 
if this test proves satisfactory, we generalize or define; and 
lastly this generalization or definition is used as a point of 
reference or truth to guide in later thinking or activity. 
There is danger that we may overlook the very great im- 
portance of inference in this process. We cannot say just 
when this step in the process will be possible, but it is possibly 
the most significant of all. A situation presents a problem.
-P-A-G-E-74
  60 A Brief Course in the Teaching Process 
Our success in solving the problem depends upon our ability 
to infer from the facts at our command. Often many inferences 
will be necessary before we succeed in finding the one that will 
stand the test. Again with the problem in mind we may be 
conscious of a great lack of data and may postpone our in- 
ference while we collect the needed information. There is 
one fallacy that must be carefully guarded against in dealing 
with children, as also with adults; namely, the tendency once 
the inference has been made to admit only such data as are 
found to support this particular hypothesis. 
It is this ability to infer, to formulate a workable hypothesis, 
which distinguishes the genius from the man of mediocre ability. 
It is the ability to see facts in new relations, the giving of new 
meaning to facts which may be the common possession of all, 
that characterizes the great thinker. Other people knew many 
of the facts; but it took the mind of a Newton to discover 
the relationship existing among these data which he formulated 
in the law that all bodies attract each other directly in pro- 
portion to their weight and inversely in proportion to the square 
of the distance separating them. As we teach children we 
should encourage the intelligent guess. We would not, of 
course, encourage mere random guessing, which may be en- 
gaged in by children to have something to say or to blind the 
teacher. A child who offers a guess or hypothesis should 
be asked to give his ground for the inference, should show that 
his guess has grown out of his consideration of the data in 
hand. It is fallacious to suppose that this kind of thinking 
is beyond the power of children. They have been forming 
their inferences and testing them in action from the time that 
they began to act independently. 
There is one element in the consideration of the step of com+ 
parison which cannot be too much emphasized, and that is tha 
it is not the comparison of things or situations which presen 
striking likenesses which gives rise to the highest type of think. 
ing. To look at a dozen horses and then to conclude that al
-P-A-G-E-75
  The Inductive Lesson 61 
horses have four legs is merely a matter of classification; to 
observe that the sun, chemical action, electricity, and friction 
produce heat, and to arrive at the generalization from these 
cases, apparently so unlike, that heat is a mode of motion is 
the work of a genius. In general, it is safe to say that we 
would greatly strengthen our teaching if we were only more 
careful to see to it that our basis for generalization is found 
in situations presenting as many variations as possible. For 
example, if we want to teach a principle in arithmetic, the way 
to fix it and to make it available for further use by our pupils 
is not to get a number of problems all of which are alike in form 
and statement; but rather we should seek as great a variety 
as is possible in the language used or symbols employed that 
is compatible with the application of the principle to be taught. 
In an interesting article on reasoning in primary arithmetic, 
Professor Suzzallo has pointed out the fact that children’s 
difficulty in reasoning is often one of language.!_ The trouble 
has been that teachers have always used a set form, or a very 
few forms of expression, when they described situations which 
involved any one of the arithmetical processes. Later when 
the child is called upon to solve a problem involving this 
process he does not know which process to apply because he is 
unfamiliar with the form of expression used. To succeed in 
teaching children when to add involves the presentation of 
the situations which call for addition with as great a variation 
as is possible, z.¢e. by using not one form, but all of the words 
or phrases which may be used to indicate summation, In like 
manner in other fields the examples for comparison will be 
valuable in proportion as they present variety rather than uni- 
formity in those elements which are not essential. Equally 
good illustration can be had from any other field. If we want 
upils to get any adequate conception of the function of adjec- 
ives, we should use examples which involve a variety of adjec- 
ives in different parts of sentences. In geography the concept

  62 <A Brief Course in the Teaching Process 
“river” will be clear only when the different types of rivers 
have been considered and the non-essential elements disregarded. 
Generalization: When we feel that we have solved the prob- 
lem, we are ready to state our generalization. There is con- 
siderable advantage in making such a statement. One can 
never be quite sure that he has solved his problem until he 
finds himself able to state clearly the results of his thinking. 
To attempt to define or to generalize is often to realize the 
inadequacy of our thought on the problem. Children should 
be encouraged to give their own definition or generalization 
before referring to that which is provided by the teacher or the 
book. Indeed, the significance of a generalization for further 
thinking or later action depends not simply upon one’s ability 
to repeat words, but rather upon adequate realization of the 
significance of the conclusion reached. The best test of such 
comprehension is found in the ability of the pupil to state the 
generalization for himself. 
There is very great danger, if definitions or generalizations 
are given ready-made to children, that they will learn to 
juggle with words. The parrot-like repetition of rules of 
syntax, or principles of arithmetic, never indicates real grasp 
of these subjects. Children think most when the requirement 
for thinking is greatest, and none are readier than they to take 
advantage of laxness on the part of the teacher in this respect. 
It is not only when the formal statement of principles or defi- 
nitions is called for that the teacher needs to be on her guard. 
At any stage of the process, if the teacher will only take their 
words and read meaning into them, some children will be found 
ready to substitute words for thought. It is really a mistake 
to tell a child that you know what he means even though he 
did not say it. Language is the instrument which he employs 
in thinking, and, if his statement lacked clearness or definite- 
ness, the chances are very great that his thinking has failed 
in these same particulars. Instead of encouraging children in 
loose thinking by accepting any statement offered, it would|
-P-A-G-E-77
  The Inductive Lesson 63 
be much better to raise the question of the real significance 
of the statement, to inquire just what was meant by the words 
used. Such procedure will help to make children more care- 
ful in expressing themselves, and will inevitably tend to 
clearer thinking. 
A pplication: Whatever conclusions we have reached, what- 
ever truths we have satisfactorily established, influence us in 
our later thought and action. But even though this is true, 
there is a decided advantage in providing for a definite appli- 
cation of the results of the thinking which children have done 
as soon as possible and in as many different ways as is feasible. 
In the first place, such application makes clearer the truth 
itself, and helps to fixitin mind. Again, the conclusion arrived 
at to-day is chiefly significant as a basis for our thinking of 
- to-morrow, and it is as we apply our conclusions that new 
problems arise to stimulate us to further thought. Then, too, 
the satisfaction which comes when one feels his power over 
situations as a result of thinking is the very best possible stim- 
ulus to further intellectual activity. Finally, we need to show 
children the application of that which they have learned to 
the life which they live outside of the school. We are not apt 
to err on the side of too frequent or too varied application of 
the generalizations we have led children to make. Rather we 
shall have to study diligently to provide enough applications 
to fix for the child the habit of verification by an appeal to 
experience. 
A few words by way of caution concerning the inductive 
lesson may not be out of place. 
First: Not all school work can be undertaken on this general 
plan. There are times when the end to be accomplished is 
distinctly not the discovery of some new truth, but rather 
the fixing of some habit. There are exercises which are dis- 
tinctively deductive, some which aim to produce habits, and 
others which seek to secure appreciation. But more of this 
is in the succeeding chapters.
-P-A-G-E-78
  64 <A Brief Course in the Teaching Process 
Second: Even when we seek to establish truth, we cannot 
always develop it by an appeal to the experience of children 
nor to observations which they can make. We shall have, on 
some occasions, to supply the data, and in still other cases it 
will be most economical to demonstrate the truth of the posi- 
tion which we desire to have them take. There are occasions 
when the solution of the problem is not possible for children. 
In this last instance we shall have to provide the authoritative 
statement. Indeed, it may be argued that one of the lessons 
which we all need to learn is respect for the expert. We can- 
not settle all of the problems which arise, but we may choose 
from among those who profess to have found a solution. Our 
education ought to help us to avoid the quack and the charla- 
tan. The habit of logical thinking on the part of children, 
and expert knowledge in some field, however small, is the only 
protection which the school can give against the pretensions 
of those who represent themselves as the dispensers of truth." 
Third: There is a grave danger that we may help children 
toomuch. Some teachers interpret the inductive development 
lesson to mean that each step in the thinking required must 
be carefully prepared for and quickly passed. They consider 
that they have taught the best lesson when there has been no 
hitch in the progress from the statement of aim to the wording 
‘of the generalization. The suggestive question which makes 
thinking on the part of children unnecessary is a favorite 
measure employed. If we stop to consider what thinking 
means, we cannot fail to see the fallacy of such work. We all 
do our best thinking, not when the problem to be solved is 
explained by some one else and all of the difficulties removed, 
but rather when we find the problem most difficult of solution. 
If children are at work on problems which are vital to them, 
we may expect them to continue to work even though they 
make mistakes. Indeed, the best recitation may be the one 
1 For a full discussion of this point, see Eliot, Educatioral Reform, the essay 
on “The Function of Education in a Democratic Society.”
-P-A-G-E-79
  The Inductive Lesson 65 
that leaves the children not with a solution skillfully supplied 
for them by the teacher, but rather with a keen realization of 
the problem, and with a somewhat clearer idea of the direction 
in which the solution may be sought. It is the teacher’s work 
to help the child to see the problem, and, seeing the problem 
herself from the child’s point of view, to stimulate the child to 
his best effort. The teacher must know not only the pupil’s 
attitude of mind toward the problem and how his mind is most 
likely to react, but also the mental activity required to master 
properly the issue that has been raised. On the one hand, the 
teacher’s equipment consists of a knowledge of the minds of the 
children whom she teaches, and on the other a knowledge of the 
subject to be taught, not simply as a body of knowledge more or 
less classified or organized, but as a mode of mental growth.! 
What the teacher needs is a clear realization of the difficulties 
which the pupils must meet, and the way in which childish 
minds may best overcome these obstacles. When such sym- 
pathy exists between teacher and pupil, we may expect that 
pupils will constantly grow stronger in their ability to think 
logically, instead of becoming more and more dependent 
upon the teacher. And this is our great work as teachers, to 
render our services unnecessary. 
Fourth: No teacher should attempt to outline her work on 
the basis of the steps indicated in the discussion of the induc- 
tive method without a clear realization of the fact that these 
steps cannot be sharply differentiated, that they are not mutu- 
ally exclusive. To define a problem adequately may mean that 
we have passed through the whole process. At any step in the 
process after the problem is defined, and some hypothesis 
formed, we may wish to verify our guess by an appeal to known 
facts, and often we shall find it necessary to abandon the 
hypothesis already formed and provide another as a basis for

Teachers,” The Third Year Book of the National Society for the Scientific Study 
of Education.

further thinking. It is true that the natural movement of the 
mind is roughly indicated by the steps named ; but it must be 
remembered that no mind can possibly arrive at the solution of 
a real problem by adhering to a fixed order of procedure. We 
do not by our teaching create the power of logical thought; 
we rather guide a mind that naturally operates logically. We 
can never teach children to reason, but we can provide the 
occasion for logical thinking, and can guard against the com- 
mon fallacies. Our success will depend upon a clear realiza- 
tion of the possibilities of the child mind and of the subjects 
we teach as part of their growth and development. 
Teaching by Types: Teaching by means of types is sometimes 
discussed as a separate method, while in reality it is simply one 
form of the inductive process. As was indicated in our dis- 
cussion of observation above, there are times when the con- 
sideration of a single situation or object in detail may be worth 
more than a thousand careless observations. It is especially 
true that a thoroughly adequate knowledge of one object or 
case of a class prepares in the best possible way for future 
observations of members of the same class. Familiarity with 
the life history of one animal or plant will help us greatly to 
understand other animals and plants, because that which is 
most essential in all has been carefully observed in the case 
considered. Nowlet us suppose that several plantsand animals 
have been studied. If the cases which are considered are truly 
typical, it may be possible for the student to appreciate not 
simply the individuals belonging to the classes studied, but 
also something of the interrelation of the several classes. This 
illustration, given because it represents in a general way 
something of the method followed in the study of science, 
represents a very common method of procedure in the ordinary 
affairs of life. None of us can hope to support our conclusions 
by a careful scrutiny of all possible cases. We take something 
on authority; namely, that the individual case considered is 
representative of a large group, then after we have investigated
-P-A-G-E-81
  The Inductive Lesson 67 
the one case we apply our conclusions to the whole group. Of 
course there is one great danger. We may be overhasty in 
our generalizations. No fallacy is more common than the 
emphasis placed upon non-essentials by those whose observa~ 
tions have been limited. The stories of the traveler who 
generalizes, after seeing one red-headed child or after eating at 
one hotel, concerning the children and hotels of the country 
visited, are too common to need repetition here. Where ob- 
servations are necessarily limited, the important consideration 
is to get cases that seem as different as possible in order that 
that which is essential may be differentiated from the non- 
essential or accidental. 
Teaching by types in our ordinary school work has been 
applied most frequently to the subject of geography. Apply- 
ing the principle stated above, we shall be careful in teaching 
rivers, mountains, cities, commerce, or any other geographical 
notion to see to it that the individual cases considered are as 
widely different as possible. To teach New York City, Phila- 
delphia, and Chicago only would give children a very erroneous 
idea of the concept “‘city.”” They are all exceptionally large, 
all American, all modern. There are cities smaller, with 
peculiarities due to age, to location, and to the ideas and re- 
sources of the people building them. A better selection would 
be New York City, London, Tokyo, Venice, Cairo, and Munich. 
Objection could still very well be offered that this list is too 
short to include all classes. There can be no doubt that to 
have taught any city carefully will aid greatly in understanding 
the notion “city” and in appreciating other cities, but mani- 
festly any final generalization concerning cities must wait until 
our knowledge of geography has been widely extended. The 
same conclusion would be reached were any other notion of 
geography, or any other study, subjected to the same test. 
There is, however, no harm in forming tentative judgments. 
Indeed, we must all do this every day of our lives. The main 
issue is to see to it that there is no mistake as to the tentative

character of the conclusions reached, that the open-minded 
attitude be preserved.

‘CHAPTER VI 
THE DEDUCTIVE LESSON 
Tue complete process of thought involves both induction 
and deduction. Every general principle, unless it is self-evi- 
dent, must either be arrived at through the process of induc- 
tion, or be accepted without any attempt at verification. 
Having formed our generalizations, we use them as a basis for 
further thinking. If we find that the principle always holds, 
we are satisfied with its validity. In this testing of the gener- 
alization tentatively made, the process of thought is deductive. 
The fact is that in the process which we designate as induction, 
deduction enters to verify our inference. In the face of the 
problem which can be settled only by reference to some estab- 
lished principle, we find ourselves questioning the generaliza- 
tions formerly accepted, and the process of thought in solving 
our problem will involve induction as well as deduction. Foy 
convenience we treat the problems of teaching under the two 
heads, the inductive and the deductive lesson, according as 
one or the other type of thought seems to predominate in 
reasoning required to solve the problem involved. 
Fyery one thinks deductively who has had sufficient expe- 
rience to form any generalizations. In the early life of the 
child we find the psychological basis for deduction in the ten- 
dency to act in accordance with ideas. Children define things 
in terms of their function. Thus a hat is something to wear 
on the head; a drawer something to pull out and push in; 
a shovel something to move the sand with; and so for the other 
objects in the child world. A child makes a dog in clay, draws 
a picture of a flower, makes a house of his blocks — and in this 
way tests his ideas. Not all deductive thinking ends in motor

activity; but we can never be satisfied with our deductions 
until we have established them experimentally. The question 
concerning our ideas always is, will they work ? 
Whenever we offer an explanation of our ideas or of cur 
actions, the process of thought is deductive. Not that either 
adults or children often state the general principle upon which 
they base their statement or action. We are all only too prone 
to assume the general principle. The foolish answers which 
children give may be logical enough. From his very limited 
experience a boy may have generalized that grass is something 
to look at and not to be walked on, and that people always live 
in houses from four to ten stories high, with many families 
in a house. Now, if such erroneous generalizations have been 
developed, the way to handle the boy is not to laugh at his de- 
ductions from these premises, but rather to require him to state 
the generalizations upon which he has based his thinking, and 
to lead him to discover their inadequacy. It matters not what 
group of children one works with, this same need for a declara- 
tion of the principle upon which the argument is based, the 
generalization which covers the situation under consideration, 
will be found essential. That teacher does much for the chil- 
dren who frequently pushes them back to a statement of what 
they assume to be true. This statement is not always easy 
tomake. Even with adults it is very common to explain action 
by reference to some feeling or attitude which it is assumed has 
some basis in reason. Some instinctive tendency, or a mode of 
feeling, thinking, or acting which has become habitual, fre- 
quently explains, but fails to justify our actions. The ability 
to state clearly what one assumes, and to claim as valid only 
such conclusions as are based on premises which are admitted 
to be true, is the mark of the man of unusual rationality. 
There is no set of rules which a teacher may follow in order 
to make the children she teaches logically minded. On the 
other hand, all of her activity tends in some degree to encourage 
or to eliminate the logical habit of mind. The teacher who
-P-A-G-E-86
  72, A Brief Course in the Teaching Process 
dogmatizes continually in her teaching can do little to over- 
come a like tendency in the children by conducting exercises 
logically correct. The wrong emphasis on correctness of the 
result, instead of correctness of the method employed in getting 
the result, encourages much illogical work and develops care- 
less habits of thought. And it is just as true that an open- 
minded attitude on the part of the teacher will be reflected 
in the children. The teacher who insists upon the verification 
of generalizations, who asks children frequently to give the 
ground for the statements which they make, and who encourages 
reflection, will engender logical habits of thought. 
To recognize the wide application of the deductive method in 
our thinking, one has only to consider what is meant by reflec- 
tion. It is well also in this connection to remember that the 
habit of reflection distinguishes the educated from the unedu- 
cated man. It is not the number of experiences which makes 
the difference between men, but rather the use that has been 
made of those experiences. [When we reflect, we think over, 
organize, and relate our past*experiencés:} Suppose, for ex- 
ample, that some one makes the statement that corporal pun- 
ishment should be banished from all schools. If you reflect 
upon such a thesis, you bring to bear your experiences, whether 
of action, observation, or thought stimulated by reading what 
some one else has said; and, as a result of your thinking, you 
consciously or unconsciously assume a general principle under 
which you feel satisfied that this question of discipline falls ; 
and then you will refer all of your experiences to this principle, 
testing its validity by seeing whether or not it does uniformly 
hold. The process of thinking which you have employed is 
essentially deductive. If stated in the form of a syllogism, it 
might be expressed somewhat as follows : — : 
1. Any action which tends to brutalize either pupil or teacher 
should not be permitted in any school. 
2. Corporal punishment tends to brutalize both teacher and 
pupil.
-P-A-G-E-87
  
The Deductive Lesson 73 
3. Hence corporal punishment should be banished from all 
schools. 
The process of thought employed has led you to search for a 
general principle which you accept as true and which offers an 
explanation of the position which you take in agreeing that 
corporal punishment should be banished. If you are really 
reflecting, you willnot stop with this reference toa generalization 
apparently true. Rather you will inquire whether in your 
experience the infliction of corporal punishment has tended to 
brutalize you. You will also ask yourself whether this is true 
of others, and to what degree. You will recall specific cases of 
punishment of this sort, and will try to decide whether the dis- 
advantages or evil outweighed the good. Only after such care- 
ful thought is the process of reflection complete, and it is only 
then that you can feel satisfied of the soundness of the position 
which you have taken. It will be noted that the process of 
thought has been both inductive and deductive. 
If children are to learn to reflect, they must have leisure to 
think over their past experiences. There is danger that in our 
desire for more knowledge and more activity on the part of 
our pupils, we may give them little time for reflection. To ask 
a child to state the significance of what he has done, to encour- 
age him to examine every assumed truth in the light of his 
experience, and to state somewhat formally the result of his 
reflection is worth much more than the new experiences which 
might have been gained in the same length of time. The habit 
of reflection will be developed only when sufficient time is 
given for children to stop and take account of the experience 
which they have had, when respect is accorded the experiences 
of the individual, and when the teacher requires such work and 
guides children in the process. 
An attempt has been made in the preceding pages to indicate 
in a general way the significance of the deductive method in 
our school work. It remains to indicate briefly the method of 
procedure in the conduct of class exercises which are essentially
-P-A-G-E-88
  74 A Brief Course in the Teaching Process 
deductive in their nature. Such exercises will be found in any 
subject in which there is developed a body of general principles. 
For example, the real test of a pupil’s knowledge of a principle 
of arithmetic is found, not in familiarity with the process of 
induction by which the principle is derived, nor in his ability 
to apply this principle to the problems given in the book, imme- 
diately following the rule, all of which fit the generalization, but 
rather in his ability, when a miscellaneous list of problems is 
given, to pick out the principle which applies to this one case. 
The test of one’s knowledge of geography is found not simply 
in the facts which he knows, but also in his ability to explain 
phenomena or to anticipate situations by reference to a body 
of general principles. 
The problem: From what has already been said it is clear 
that in deductive thinking, as well as when the process is induc- 
tive, the occasion for thought is found in a problem tobesolved. 
We wish to know whya certain region is arid or what the possi- 
bilities of agriculture are in another, and we, therefore, recall our 
knowledge of the principles of geography in order to solve our 
problem. A moral situation confronts us; we need to act ; and 
in response to this necessity we endeavor to refer the situation 
to some norm or standard of conduct which we accept as fun- 
damental. The success of our work in securing clear thinking 
by children will always be conditioned by our success in enabling 
them to realize the significance of the problem presented for 
solution. 
Finding the generalization or principles which fit the situa- 
tion to be accounted for or explained is the next step. In order 
to accomplish this part of the process successfully one must be 
able to discover that which is essential and to neglect the non- 
essentialin the problem tobe solved. Suppose, for example, that 
the problem is: Why has the greater part of Africa not been 
settled by civilized men? The factor which is significant is the 
climate of this region, and it will be of no use for the pupil to 
recall the size of the continent, the color of its inhabitants, the
-P-A-G-E-89
  
The Deductive Lesson 75 
fact that Livingstone made a journey across it, except that by 
eliminating these facts he may be brought to realize that none 
of them determine the situation, and hence he need no longer 
pay any attention to them. It is the function of the teacher 
to suggest to the pupil a number of alternatives and then to 
guide him in his search for the determining factor. For 
example, the teacher might ask: Is it because of the savage 
inhabitants, because of a lack of means of transportation, be- 
cause the country is overrun by dangerous wild animals, or be- 
cause of climate? ach of these classes of facts may be known 
to the pupils, and each in turn may be eliminated as non-de- 
termining factors until he comes finally to the last. He must 
then, provided he decides that climate may determine the 
availability of a region as a habitation for civilized man, dis- 
cover under what condition of climate civilized man fails to 
make advance. He has thus fitted his situation, his problem, 
to the generalization under which it falls, and has, in fact, taken 
the next step in the process. 
Inference: The inference that the greater part of Africa is 
not inhabited by civilized men because of adverse climatic 
conditions is arrived at just as soon as the pupil settles upon 
climate as the essential factor. Just as in the inductive 
process we pass immediately from the step of comparison and 
abstraction to the statement of the generalization, so in the 
deductive lesson, when once we have related the particular case 
under consideration to the principle which explains the situa- 
tion, we are ready to state our inference. There is real value 
in making such a statement. The further process of verifica- 
tion depends upon a clear and definite statement of the infer- 
ence; and the best test we have of the completion of the pre- 
ceding step is the ability which the pupil shows to state his 
inference. 
Verification: When the inference has been made, we have 
yet to satisfy ourselves concerning the validity of our reason- 
ing by an appeal to known facts. Following the illustration
-P-A-G-E-90
  76 A Brief Course in the Teaching Process 
already used, we should ask ourselves what has happened in the 
past to civilized men who have gone to Central Africa. We will 
be satisfied that our reasoning has been correct, onlyif all of the 
facts we are able to discover point unmistakably to the con- 
clusion that the climate of the larger part of Africa is unendur- 
able by civilized men. 
The element which needs most emphasis in deductive teach- 
ing is the realization on the part of the teacher that the success 
oi the process is directly proportional to the independence with 
which the pupil discovers for himself that which is essential in 
the situation under consideration, his attempt to fit or relate 
the particular case to the principle or generalization by which 
it will be explained, and his willingness, when he discovers his 
error by an attempted verification, to repeat the process. We 
do not think logically by having some one else do our thinking 
for us, nor is our growth measured by the uniformity with which 
we hit upon the correct solution of the problem at the first 
attempt. Rather we may measure success by the power of our 
pupils to criticize the reasoning which appears plausible until 
carefully scrutinized, and by their readiness to retrace their 
steps and to search for firmer ground when they have of their 
own accord given up a scheme of reasoning which has proved 
invalid.

  CHAPTER VII 
LESSON FOR APPRECIATION 
EpvucaTION aims not only to enable one to avoid error, tc 
discover truth, and to equip him with desirable habits, but also 
to develop the power to appreciate and to enjoy that which is 
beautiful, whether in literature, painting, sculpture, art, or 
music. It is not enough that a man be able to make a living; 
he ought, as a result of his education, to be able to enjoy life. 
Matthew Arnold’s definition of culture, ‘the acquainting our- 
selves with the best that has been known and said in the 
world,” embodies much that‘is essential in modern education. 
The ability to enjoy a drama of Shakespeare, a picture of 
Millet, or an opera of Wagner, means the possibility of noble 
pleasure, of leisure time spent in such a way that inspiration 
and strength, instead of possible waste, or, even worse, degra- 
dation and weakness, result. It is, then, a vital part of our 
school work to give opportunity for and to encourage in every 
way possible the development of power of appreciation. 
Some of our schoolroom exercises ought to aim primarily 
to develop power of appreciation in the several fields men- 
tioned above. Not that appreciation can be taught directly, 
but because there are conditions which are negative in their 
influence. No one will ever learn to appreciate music or liter- 
ature or art because some one tells him that he ought and that 
this is worthy and that unworthy. This sort of teaching will 
result in hypocrisy and cant. On the other hand, the best 
guarantee of development along these lines is found in associa- 
tion with those who do genuinely appreciate. It is in this 
fact that we find our first suggestion for work of this kind. 
8 
 
-P-A-G-E-93
  Lesson for Appreciation 79 
Do not try to teach any one else to enjoy that which you 
do not fully appreciate yourself. The fundamental qualifica- 
tion for the teacher is power to appreciate. She must enjoy 
to the full that which she hopes to make appear beautiful in 
the eyes of her pupils. It is useless to ask children to enjoy 
one of Stevenson’s child rhymes, if you find yourself unable 
to enter into the spirit of the poem. Pictures may be hung 
on the wall and religiously taught; but children will not want 
to buy good pictures, nor are they apt to frequent the art 
galleries, unless they have associated with those for whom 
pictures are a genuine source of pleasure. The best prepara- 
tion for the teacher who feels that her teaching is inadequate 
in those phases ef her work which involve appreciation is to 
plan to do what she can to insure her own growth in this par- 
ticular. Read more poetry, and especially read it with those 
who derive great pleasure therefrom, if you wish to teach poetry 
better. If you are familiar with the great musicians, and have 
through your acquaintance with their work developed some 
measure of appreciation for this type of expression and for the 
method by which the musician has been able to build up his 
wonderful composition, then you may rest assured that your 
pupils will not find music uninteresting. 
The question most frequently asked concerning the teaching 
of those subjects in which we seek to develop appreciation is 
whether one must command the technique involved in creation 
in order to grow in power to enjoy the work of the masters. 
For example, must one be able to read music in order to ap- 
preciate music; must one be able to state the rhetorical excel- 
lence of Stevenson’s narratives in order to enjoy his stories; 
is it essential that one fully appreciate the technique of paint- 
ing in order to get the most out of Corot? In general, the an- 
swer is that such knowledge of technique may either help or 
hinder one in his actual power of appreciation. It will hinder, 
if the consideration of technique is constantly uppermost in 
one’s mind; it will help in so far as knowledge of technique 
 
-P-A-G-E-94
  80 A Brief Course in the Teaching Process 
gives one the feeling of excellence or perfection of form, pro- 
vided always that it is this beauty of the product which most 
engages the attention, and that interest in technique is sub- 
sidiary. To express the same idea in another way: if one’s 
knowledge of technique makes him overcritical or oversensi- 
tive, he is apt to lose all enjoyment in his concentration upon 
the technique, in looking for weaknesses, or in his feeling of 
discomfort because of imperfection. What significance, it 
may be asked, has this for our teaching? Mainly this, that 
we must remember that appreciation is in large measure a 
matter of the emotions, and that any attempt to overintel- 
lectualize the process will defeat the end we desire to secure. 
There is no other kind of work in which the attitude of the 
individual at the beginning of the exercise is as important. 
There is a story told of a teacher who wished to teach a beau- 
tiful poem, the burden of which was the beauty of kindness to 
birds. She began with the birds that the children knew — 
sparrows. In a short time the children developed the notion, 
and very justly, that sparrows were a pest, that they had driven 
away our song birds, and that it would be a good thing to ex- 
terminate them. The children were ready to go forth to the 
slaughter; and then came the poem with its admonition to 
kindness toward birds. These children would, of course, 
have been more impressed had this preparatory work been 
omitted entirely. Very frequently for work of this kind, the 
very best preparation is found in placing children directly in 
contact with that which you hope to have them appreciate. 
Read the poem, play the music, expose the picture to view, and 
allow them to do their work. Later a somewhat more detailed 
treatment, possibly involving many repetitions, will give oppor- 
tunity for increased appreciation. 
Children should not be forced to give expression to the feel- 
ing awakened. The teacher may accept gladly such expression 
as comes spontaneously. She may at times ask for a selection 
of the part most enjoyed. Especially to be avoided are 
oo
-P-A-G-E-95
  Lesson for Appreciation 81 
expressions such as: “Don’t you think this beautiful?” 
“Don’t you enjoy this?” and the like. Children under such 
stimulation are apt to say that they enjoy whether they do or 
not. They are just as anxious to do the right thing as are some 
of their elders. To be constantly directed, always told what to 
admire, means lack of confidence in one’s own ability to judge 
of excellence, or, even worse, the attitude of the hypocrite 
who admires that which he thinks it fashionable to favor. It is 
probably safer to judge of the success of work of this kind by the 
expression on the faces of the children than by the words you 
may persuade them to use. 
Ina lesson of this type the teacher does the best work when she 
acts as interpreter. Success depends not so much upon initia- 
tive on the part of the children as upon the ability of the teacher 
to sympathize with the childish point of view, and to lead them 
to greater heights by the force of suggestion growing out of her 
own joy in that which she presents. It is by voice, by gesture, 
by suggestion, and by explanation,— in all, by providing the most 
favorable opportunity possible for appreciation, keeping herself 
asmuch as possible in the background,— that the teacher makes 
provision for the development of this power by children. 
Much is gained in power of appreciation by giving oppor- 
tunity for creative work on the part of children. The group 
of children who have composed a song, and who have labored 
diligently to make the music which they have written fit the 
spirit and rhythm of the words, will find a new meaning in the 
lullaby which they are asked to learn to-morrow. Music will 
mean so much more than pitch, time, notes of different value, 
and the like. Through their own attempt they will have real- 
ized in the best possible way the fact that the music of the 
song is intended to express feeling in harmony with the words 
that they sing. The child who has attempted to draw a land- 
scape will by virtue of that fact grow in power to enjoy the 
landscape placed on the wall for his enjoyment. And so for 
any other field in which we seek to develop power of apprecia- 
G
-P-A-G-E-96
    82 A brief Course in the Teaching Process 
tion; to attempt to create for himself will give the child a bet- 
ter understanding of the elements which go to make up excel- 
lence, and the contrast between his own effort and that of the 
master will greatly enhance the value of the latter in his eyes. 
Thus far in our discussions of the lesson for appreciation we 
have interpreted it to mean the development of the esthetic 
emotions. There is another sort of appreciation which involves 
rather more of the intellectual element, but which, so far as 
teaching method is concerned, may probably be treated to 
greatest advantage in this same connection. Indeed, there 
are cases, as in literature, where both elements are involved. 
In the study of a drama of Shakespeare we are concerned not 
only with the beauty of expression, but quite as much with the 
portrayal of the lives of men and women as they have acted and 
reacted on each other in their common environment. In his- 
tory we have this drama extended to include a nation or the 
nations of the world in their relations to each other. In either 
case we have the record of cause and effect, an account of social 
experience fundamentally akin to our own. Appreciation 
here involves the ability to follow the logical relations which are 
recorded. In proportion as one becomes aware of the motives 
which have actuated men, the relationships which have 
existed among them, the organization and outcome of their | 
activities, he has widened his own experience. This possibil- 
ity of a vicarious extension of the child’s social experience is 
one of the reasons for giving history and literature a place in 
our school curriculum. 
Let us inquire what is involved in securing appreciation of 
this type. Take, for example, the appreciation of the period 
just preceding the Civil War. How are we to understand this 
remote situation? We cannot observe directly ; we cannot, as 
is the case in the solution of a problem in our present expe- 
rience, gather data by means of observation; nor can we test 
our conclusions by experiment. Our first great need is to have 
presented all of the facts possible. We may read the histo-   
-P-A-G-E-97
  Lesson for Appreciation 83 
rian’s account, or have it read to us; we may get hold of the 
newspapers published at that time; read the debates which 
took place in Congress; peruse the letters of men and women 
who lived and wrote at that time; make inquiry concerning 
the number of slaves, and the value of the Southern plantations 
worked by them; try to find out why slavery had been abol- 
ished in the North, and by every means possible familiarize 
ourselves with what men said and did and the conditions under 
which they worked at that time. We must have this material 
made accessible to the children through books or by word of 
mouth before we ask them to follow the logical relations estab- 
lished among these facts by the historian. Appreciation has 
its beginning in the abundance of data supplied which makes 
possible the imagery with which the children are to work, and 
isconsummated when the child has, through his own efforts and 
by following the development of another, come to understand 
the play of cause and effect, the organization and relationship 
existing among these human activities. Work of this sort 
has in the last step something in common with the inductive 
lesson, but with this difference, that the children are in the main 
concerned with appreciation of facts and of the relationships 
established among them by some one else, presumably the 
expert historian. It is more a matter of understanding than 
the discovery of new truth. Of course, there are lessons in his- 
tory in which the problem is just as distinct as in anyscience, 
and where the work can be best described as inductive or 
deductive reasoning. 
And so likewise for literature. The author presents the 
situation, and draws his conclusions, supposedly true to the 
logic of human action. The teacher may need to supply details 
which are missing, may need to guide the children in their 
attempt to follow the interpretation of the author, but it must 
be mainly interpretation of facts provided; and presumably, 
if great literature is studied, the appreciation of the author’s 
interpretation of the human relations is of vastly greater im- 
 
-P-A-G-E-98
  84 <A Brief Course in the Teaching Process 
portance than the attempt at interpretation which the chil- 
dren may make. 
Appreciation does not mean quiescence, —farfromit. Neither 
does it concern itself primarily with the discovery of new truth 
or excellence. Rather we aim to understand, and to enjoy, 
when the esthetic emotions are involved, the work of the mas- 
ters. If we can, even in some degree, lead children to think 
their thoughts, to interpret human activity and human feeling 
as they have interpreted it, we shall have most signally widened 
and enriched their experience, and shall have made available 
for them for all their lives a source of recreation and enjoyment, 
a storehouse of wisdom, which may constitute their greatest 
indebtedness to our efforts in their behalf.

    CHAPTER VIII 
THE STUDY LESSON 
Tuat it is the main business of the teacher to render her 
services unnecessary cannot be too often reiterated. To be 
able to reason clearly one’s self; to have control of one’s 
habits; in short, to know how to use one’s energies to best 
advantage when the problems of life are encountered, is the 
greatest benefit to be derived from education. We shall con- 
cern ourselves in this discussion with study as it involves con- 
trolled thinking, whether inductive or deductive; with the 
most economical method of making knowledge more available 
for use by increasing the possibility of recall; and with the 
possibility of reducing certain knowledge or responses, whether 
physical or mental, to the basis of habit. 
In general, our problem in teaching children to study con- 
sists in making them conscious of the best methods to be em- 
ployed in logical thinking, or in the formation of habits, and 
then in giving sufficient practice in the use of these methods to 
make them the habitual manner of reaction, as far as this is 
possible. It is true, of course, that one who applies the logical 
method to a question of mathematics or geography may be 
swayed by prejudice when the question concerns politics or 
religion; and that the man who knows best how to form 
desirable habits may be so bound by some other that he will 
fail to achieve that which he knows to be desirable. Be this 
as it may, if the school makes the child conscious of the most 
economical methods of work, the chances for later efficiency 
are greatly increased. 
Strangely enough, what we have been prone to call good 
86
-P-A-G-E-101
  The Study Lesson 87 
teaching has not always accomplished this desired result. It 
has too often happened that the direction and help offered by 
the teacher have tended to make the child dependent, utterly 
unable to do a piece of work for himself. Even when children 
have supposedly been required to do much thinking, the teacher 
has sometimes weakened her work by continually stepping in 
to propose the next step whenever a critical point has been 
reached. The argument which proves conclusively that chil- 
dren do not learn to work independently is found in their 
inability in the upper grades, in the high school, and even in 
the college to use their time to good advantage.! 
In teaching children how to study, the first step involves 
fs clear statement of the problem to be solved. The teacher 
who says ‘‘take the next five pages” cannot expect that the 
children will do anything more, so far as learning how to study 
is concerned, than waste time in fulfilling her demands. We 
think hard when we have a problem to solve. If it be true 
that children need to have an aim clearly in mind when they 
are at work with the teacher, it is much more essential that 
they should have clearly in mind the goal toward which they 
are striving when they work alone. Whenever children are 
expected to do any work at their seats or at home, the type 
of assignment becomes a determining factor. It is a mistake 
to suppose that a minute or two at the end of a recitation will 
be sufficient to make clear to the pupils the problem involved 
in the work to be accomplished during the study hour. The 
best time to make assignments is when, as the subject is de- 
veloped, a problem arises which cannot then be solved. A 
good recitation ought to culminate in the statement of the 
questions yet to be answered quite as much as in a statement 
of what has been accomplished. If the class has been kept 
intellectually alert, there ought to be raised by the children

many questions, which may be assigned either to the whole class 
r to individuals for report at a succeeding recitation. 
A very good incentive to study is found in making assign- 
ments to individuals or groups for report to the whole class. 
Even if the problem itself is not of surpassing interest, the 
desire to contribute one’s share to the group project, and the 
wish to do as well as one’s neighbor, will stimulate to greater 
effort. It would be well if teachers tested their own work 
and the children’s comprehension of the assignments made 
by asking frequently during the study period for a statement 
of the problem. To read a book intelligently, to perform an 
experiment to advantage, children must know what they 
seek. The attitude which we hope to develop should lead 
a child to ask, when in doubt, such questions as these : “What 
am I to try to find out from reading this chapter?” “What 
am I to look for on the excursion?” ‘What is the problem 
which we are now discussing?” ‘Is the report which has 
just been made to the point?” ‘Did John’s answer have 
anything to do with the question we are discussing?” and 
the like. When children have learned to expect to work 
toward the accomplishment of some definite result in thought 
as well as in action, when they hold to the main issue regard- 
less of the allurements of subsidiary problems which should 
be held for later investigation, when they become critical of the 
contributions offered by books or by their companions, then, 
and not until then, have they taken the first step in learning 
to study. 
When children have become conscious of the meaning of the 
ines or problem as an element in successful study, and when 
\ their practice is guided by this consciousness, they will meet 
with another difficulty in learning how to secure the data 
adequate for the solution of the problem. Before leaving the 
elementary school, children should know how to use dictionaries, 
encyclopedias, gazetteers, year books, and the like. It is 
passing strange that college students often seem not to know
-P-A-G-E-103
  The Study Lesson 8g 
the purpose either of the table of contents or of the index in 
the books which they use. It is pitiful to see a person leafing 
through a book trying to find information on some question 
at issue, when in a minute he could find in the index just the 
Page or section in which this topic is treated, and so spend the 
time gathering data instead of wasting it in a random search 
for the information desired. It is necessary to teach children 
to consult the indices and tables of contents of books, and to 
give them frequent practice in work of this kind, if they are 
commonly to employ this device or method. 
Another help to the collection of data might very well begin 
_ to be used in the intermediate grades of the elementary school ; 
it is the practice of noting, when more than one book or source 
\ of information is used, just where the information is to be 
\found, and something of its nature. If the pupil consults more 
‘than one authority, the one read last may raise questions 
which must be answered by a return to those used earlier, and 
one ought to be able to turn directly to the sources formerly 
consulted. Or it may be that a similar problem, or one having 
much in common with it, will arise a week or a month later, 
when a record of the sources of information consulted before 
will lighten the work by half. A record of this sort could be 
kept in notebooks, or, as is done by older people who know 
how to work, in a card index. Of course work of this kind 
presupposes the use of some books other than a single text- 
book; and to go very far in giving children the command of 
the technique of study we shall have to provide ourselves 
with more than a single book for a subject. 
Another way by which children can be greatly helped is 
teaching them how to take notes and how to annotate. There 
is no exercise more valuable to the student, so far as his future 
work is concerned, than practice in writing in a very few words 
the gist of a paragraph or page. As they reflect later, they 
‘may want to know the argument of this authority or that, 
but they must have it in condensed form or they will be little 
er
-P-A-G-E-104
90 6A Brief Ccurse in the Teaching Process 
better off than whea they began their work. A very helpful 
exercise is to have children to abstract, either orally or in writ- 
ing, a page or two of a book which they are studying, and to 
compare results. In this work the problem is that which con- 
fronts the thinker at every stage of his work, the selection of 
that which is relevant and the discarding of that which is less 
significant. If we think logically, among the mass of possible 
data we must always choose that which in our judgment is 
relatively most valuable for our purpose. The teacher in the 
organization of material for presentation in any subject is con- 
fronted constantly with the problem of zelative values. Not 
all can be presented, even though relevant to the issue in- 
volved; hence, choice must be made. And just so, if the child 
learns to study, to conduct his own investigations, he must 
be made conscious of this need of discrimination, and he must 
be given practice in its exercise. 
; Adequate study demands not simply that an abundance 
of data which bear on the problem be secured, but that the 
/validity of the data be brought into question. Children ought 
‘not to accept blindly the statements of books or even of the 
teacher. The one thing which characterizes the student is his 
search for truth, his attitude of inquiry as opposed to an appeal 
to authority. It is well for children at times to question the 
statements found in their books when experience suggests 
the doubt. It is equally important, of course, that they be 
willing to acknowledge their mistake, should proof be forth- 
coming in support of the book. If a child really studies, he 
must, even as an adult, find statements of fact, the records 
of observations or experiments, which are at variance with the 
evidence which he already possesses. It is just in this par- 
ticular that the student differs from ordinary men who allow 
others to do their thinking for them. The student may not 
be able to settle the question, and so forms a judgment which 
is frankly tentative. Children ought to have the experience 
of finding that there are some questions to which a definite 
 
-P-A-G-E-105
  The Study Lesson gI 
answer cannot, in the present state of knowledge, be given. 
They should be shown, wherever possible, how the conclu- 
sions of men on some of the most important problems that 
have been studied have changed from time to time. They 
can at times be made to realize the folly of overhasty gener- 
alization. 
No one has learned how to study who has not been trained 
to reflect upon his experience, whether the experience has been 
recently acquired with the express purpose of solving his prob- 
lem, or is some more remote element in experience which may 
shed light on the question in hand. A skillful teacher can 
guide in this process of reflection, and will later tell them what 
is meant, and demonstrate for them something of the value 
of the practice. It is quite worth while for a student to know 
when he has concentrated his attention upon a problem, and 
just what is meant by reflection. Many older people deceive 
themselves into thinking that they are exercising themselves 
in these directions when a slight acquaintance with the ele- 
ments involved in fixing attention or in reflection might awaken 
them to the futility of their practices. There need be noth- 
ing occult or hard to understand about the practice of study. 
It is not a matter of terminology nor of a systematic course 
in psychology, but rather consists in guiding the individual 
in his practice of the art, and then making known to him the 
elements in his experience which have meant success or failure. 
It may be enlightening to compare the emphasis upon careful 
examination of data, the formation of tentative rather than 
fixed judgments, the guarding against hasty generalizations, 
and the emphasis upon reflection with the steps of presentation, 
of comparison and abstraction, and of generalization in the 
‘inductive lesson, and with the corresponding steps of the de- 
ductive lesson. The conviction will probably be deepened 
that when the teacher instructs the student in the art of study 
she is making available for him the method which she employs 
in instruction. This must be the relationship; for the teacher 
 
-P-A-G-E-106
  92 A Brief Course in the Teaching Process 
can do nothing more than take account of the way the child 
learns, and adapt her method to his possibilities. 
The habit of verification is one of the most important from 
the point of view of learning how to study. The questions 
which the student must constantly ask himself are: ‘Can the 
conclusions be applied?” ‘‘Do they always hold?” ‘Does 
it work?” Fine-spun theories are of little avail, however 
much satisfaction the originator of them may have found in 
deriving them. At every step in the progress of his thought 
the conclusions must be tested by an appeal to known facts. 
The teacher cannot too frequently insist upon this step as the 
criterion of the worth of the thinking which has been done. 
And the insistence will be necessary, for it seems natural for 
human beings to become so enamored of their theories that 
they hesitate to expose them to the test which may prove them 
false. 
Teaching children to memorize: Throughout the school life 
of the child, memorizing is a regular part of his work. If 
practice alone were necessary, every child should soon learn 
how to do this kind of work in the most economical manner. 
The great difficulty is that often neither teacher nor pupil has 
given any thought tothe method employed, their attention hav- 
ing been wholly engrossed with success or failure in achiev- 
ing the result. It is a well established principle of psychol- 
ogy that the possibility of recall is conditioned by the system 
of ideas with which that which we wish to recall has been identi- 
fied. The more associations made, or the more perfect our 
control of any system of ideas which involves that which we 
wish to remember, the greater the probability of bringing to 
mind the fact when we need it. As Professor James puts it: 
“Of two men with the same outward experience, the one who 
thinks over his experiences most, and weaves them into the most 
systematic relations with each other, will be the one with the 
best memory.” And along with this fact is another equally 
important for the teacher: that we may not hope to increase
-P-A-G-E-107
The Study Lesson 93 
the native power of retentiveness. The child whom we teach 
may be endowed by nature with little or mucl: power of this 
sort, and we cannot change it; but we can improve his method 
of memorizing. 
The first step in memorizing is to understand. If we try 
to commit to memory the words of a book when we do not fully 
comprehend the meaning, we are depending very largely on 
our desultory memory, z.e. upon our ability to remember the 
things because they have been once present in mind ; and our 
efficiency will depend wholly upon our quality of native re- 
tentiveness. But, unfortunately, for want of knowledge of 
a better method, children are frequently satisfied that they are 
doing adequate work when they are repeating over and over 
again the words which they have made little attempt to com- 
prehend. 
Even when the sense of the words to be memorized is fairly 
clear, it is uneconomical to employ this method of accretion. 
The child who studies the poem by saying first the first line, then 
the second, then the first and second, then the third, then the 
first, the second, and the third, depends upon mere repetition, 
not upon thinking, for the persistence of the impression. It 
has been demonstrated that on the basis of the amount of 
time required this method is uneconomical. Add to this the 
fact that after the first complete repetition, later successful 
recall depends upon the efficiency of the system of associated 
ideas which have been established ; and there can be no doubt 
of the folly of such a method of procedure. It is no wonder 
that children who commit to memory in this way forget so 
readily. They may have understood what they said when 
they first repeated the poem ; but the method they employed 
almost precludes the building up of a system of associated 
ideas on the basis of careful thinking. 
If the child has read aloud and understands the selection to 
be memorized, the next thing to be done is to analyze it into its 
principal thought units; and then each of these large units 
   
-P-A-G-E-108
  94 A Brief Course in the Teaching Process 
of thought may be again carefully scrutinized until a full appre- 
ciation of the thought has been accomplished. The thought 
of the whole may then be stated, using as far as possible the 
words of the author, and then each of the subdivisions or 
thought units may be examined in more detail in order to get 
the shade of meaning that is brought out by this or that word, 
by relationship of codrdination or subordination of clause, or 
the modification indicated by this word or phrase. It will be 
necessary, as the work progresses on the large thought units 
into which the selection has been divided, to return constantly 
to the whole thought in order to keep clear the relationship of 
the part to the whole, and to establish the part in the system of 
ideas which we seek to build up. ‘All the evidence we have 
goes to show that the method of memorizing by wholes is most 
economical.” 1 If children were taught to work in this way, 
there would be little drudgery about memorizing. The care- 
ful, thoughtful study once completed, memorization has been 
accomplished. The energy and attention of the child have not 
been centered upon a merely technical process, but he has been 
concerned mainly in trying to appreciate fully the thought that 
he is to make his own. Memory work of this kind is highly 
educative, not merely because of the product, but also because 
of the process employed. Suppose, for example, you wish 
children to memorize Stevenson’s Bed in Summer: — 
In winter I get up at night 
And dress by yellow candle-light. 
In summer, quite the other way, 
I have to go to bed by day. 
I have to go to bed and see 
The birds still hopping on the tree, 
Or hear the grown-up people’s feet 
Still going past me in the street.

to Memory,” Journal of Educational Psychology, Vol. I, pp. 133-142.
-P-A-G-E-109
  The Study Lesson 95 
And does it not seem hard to you, 
When all the sky is clear and blue, 
And I should like so much to play, 
To have to go to bed by day? 
You would begin by reading the whole poem, calling to mind 
the experiences of the children in going to bed before dark on 
the long summer evenings and of the cold, dark winter morn- 
ings when they may have dressed before it was light. The 
number and the kind of explanations which will need to be 
made will, of course, depend upon the previous experience of 
the children and the time of the year. Then the poem might 
be read again a time or two. After this preliminary work has 
been done, you might ask some one to tell you the story. Let 
us suppose that the reply was about as follows: “A little boy 
had to get up before it was light in the winter, and go to bed 
before it was dark in the summer. In summer when he went 
to bed he heard the birds hopping on the trees and the people 
walking past him in the street. He thought it was hard to 
have to go to bed when it was still daylight, when he wanted 
so much to play.”” If the main facts were less well told, or if 
there were notable omissions, it would be necessary to get at 
least an outline of the main thought before proceeding. Now 
we are ready to call the attention of the children to three main 
thoughts, each told in a stanza. First, the difference between 
getting up in winter and going to bed in summer. Second, 
what did the boy in the story see and hear when he went to bed 
before dark? Third, how do you feel when you have to go to 
bed in summer while the sky is still so clear and blue, and you 
would like so much to play ? 
It will be very easy to get the thought of the first stanza 
impressed in the words of the author. It will help to read 
the whole poem again, the teacher meanwhile asking the chil- 
dren to pay particular attention to the way the author says 
it.. Possibly there will be some difficulty with “quite the 
other way,” but skillful questioning will get the correct form. 
 
-P-A-G-E-110
    96 A Brief Course in the Teaching Process 
And so for the second'and third stanzas ; if the thought is clear, 
the words will follow very easily. After each thought has been 
thus carefully developed, with the whole story always in mind, 
and the words of the author have been made the vehicle of ex- 
pressing the thought by the children, it will be advantageous 
to have the poem repeated several times by individual mem- 
bers of the class. In this repetition the dramatic element 
should enter as far as possible. ‘To suit the action to the word, 
to really feel what one recites, helps greatly to strengthen the 
impression, and thus aids recall. 
It may be thought that the illustration used was particularly 
well adapted to illustrate the theory advanced. Or some 
teacher may say that children would memorize Bed in Summer 
without teaching. It may, therefore, not be out of place to 
suggest that the best way to discover for one’s self the value 
of the method is to try it. It will work equally well if the sub- 
ject is Lincoln’s Gettysburg Address, a selection from the 
Declaration of Independence, the Twenty-third Psalm, or any 
other masterpiece of English. 
The principles to be applied are essentially the same even 
when verbatim memorization is not required. To get lasting 
control of the facts of geography or of history, one must have 
reduced them to a system. There must be a relating of less 
important facts to more important, a clustering of important 
points of reference to any other facts which are logically re- 
lated. This, indeed, is just what scientific organization means, 
and the main purpose of such organization is to render facts more 
available, to save labor. The memory is relieved of much of 
its burden when once we have established the relationship of 
cause and effect, of equivalence, of similarity, or of analogy 
among facts. It is this association of ideas on a logical basis 
which counts most in the possibility of recall. 
It is quite possible for children, very early in their school life, 
to begin to apply these principles and to become conscious of 
the fact that the way they do their work has an important
-P-A-G-E-111
  The Study Lesson 97 
bearing upon the ease with which it is accomplished and the 
permanency of the results gained. The work of the teacher 
is not done by merely dictating the method, even though that 
may help greatly to establish right habits of study; our best 
assurance that the method will be employed when the teacher 
is not present to direct the work is found in our knowledge that 
the children not only habitually, but also when a question 
arises or there is a suggestion of another way, consciously 
employ the right method. 
Teaching children how to form habits: Our next prob- 
lem is to inquire how children may be led consciously to employ 
the principles of habit formation when their school work in- 
volves work of this type. They can be taught the function of 
drill or repetition, and can be led to see under what conditions 
such work will prove most successful. It is not difficult to 
prove to a boy that his listless, half-hearted work in repeating 
the spelling of the words he has missed is making little im- 
provement in his ability to spell them. A boy can be led to 
see by an illustration in which he himself is the chief actor 
that concentrated attention will make much difference. Let 
him see how much he can accomplish in ten minutes, and thus 
get him in the habit of using this means when he finds that he 
is not working up to his normal capacity. Show him that a 
new impetus will be given and that attention will be easier if 
he reverses the order, writes instead of spelling orally, or closes 
his eyes and attempts to visualize the words. No matter 
what motive the boy has for the attempt he is making, he will 
welcome the suggestions which make the task easier. 
Later you can teach this same boy the need of verification 
before drilling himself whenever a question of fact is raised. In 
the beginning, of course, the doubt or question will be raised by 
the teacher, and it will be the chief work of the child to find an 
authority and assure himself that he has the right idea or form 
before proceeding. A big step in the education of a child has 
been taken when he is able to say, ‘I know I am right, because 
H
-P-A-G-E-112
  98 A Brief Course in the Teaching Process 
I have consulted the commonly accepted authority.” Occas 
sions will arise constantly in the study of any subject where, 
instead of asking the teacher or being satisfied with information 
which is of questionable validity, the child should, as a matter 
of habit, turn to the authority for verification. It is not at 
all unusual for children to have misgivings, but they too fre- 
quently end by going ahead and ignoring their doubt. To 
respect one’s doubts, to be somewhat critical, is significant for 
education only when one is led thereby to endeavor to discover 
the truth. Children will work to advantage when they realize 
that these steps of doubt, verification, repetition, with undi- 
vided attention, are essential to good work. 
Children can be taught the necessity of accuracy in practice. 
Any day’s work in a schoolroom will furnish illustrations of 
the danger of lapses and the necessity of guarding against them. 
The fallacy of the notion that “this one doesn’t count” can be 
made just as clear to children as to adults. So, too, the mis- 
taken notion that cramming may be substituted for systematic 
work day in and day out can be brought to the attention of 
pupils. 
It would be a good plan for every teacher to ask herself 
questions like the following : “What would the children do if I 
did not carefully direct their work?” “How much better able 
are they now to work independently than they were at the 
beginning of the year?’’ “Can they take a book and find in it 
the part which bears upon the topic assigned for study, and 
do they do it with the least possible waste of time and energy ?” 
“Do they know how to memorize; what it means to concen- 
trate their attention; how to reflect?” ‘Are they more 
open-minded or more dogmatic on account of the year spent 
with me?” “Have they established the habit of verifi- 
cation?” ‘Do they appreciate the method to be employed in 
habit formation?” To answer these questions honestly will 
give the teacher some idea of her success as a teacher, for the 
teacher’s goal is realized in proportion as her pupils have
-P-A-G-E-113
  The Study Lesson 99 
advanced in power to work independently of her guidance or 
control. : 
In teaching children how to study, it will be well to devote 
whole periods to this type of exercise. The teacher will gain 
much in the progress which her class will make by taking a 
period frequently during which she studies with the children. 
By example rather than by precept, by guiding children in 
correct methods of study and then making them conscious 
that they have done their work to the best possible advantage, 
rather than by telling them what to do, she will secure the 
maximum of results in her endeavor to teach children how to 
study.

   CHAPTER IX 
REVIEW OR EXAMINATION LESSON 
THE review or the examination, in so far as methods of 
teaching are concerned, present the same problem. We seek 
by means of exercises of this type to bring about a better or- 
ganization of knowledge, to test the efficiency of our work by 
finding out whether or not pupils can, when put to the test, 
utilize the knowledge or habits which we have labored to make 
available for them, whether they are actuated by the ideals 
and purposes which we have sought to inculcate, whether they 
do actually employ the most economical methods of work 
when they meet a situation which challenges their strength. 
It will be recognized at once that work of this sort is a part of 
every recitation. But for our own satisfaction, and, possibly, 
in order to meet the requirements which may be imposed by 
those higher in authority, we may at times feel the need for a 
stated exercise of this sort. 
A review should mean a new view, a placing of facts in their 
true relationship. It should mean a clearer view of the topic 
or the subject which the children have been studying. It 
avails little to go over the ground that has already been covered 
more rapidly. The purpose to be accomplished is not to fix 
in mind a series of unrelated facts. In our discussion of mem- 
ory we had occasion to call attention to the fact that recall of 
past experiences was conditioned by the number and the 
quality of the associations which had been established. And 
it is not simply a matter of recall. The use that we can make 
of a fact depends upon our ability to relate it logically to other 
facts. It is quite possible that a man of great native reten-

-P-A-G-E-116
  102 A Brief Course in the Teaching Process 
tiveness might be able to recall thousands of facts, and yet be 
stupid, utterly unable to do the thinking required for effective 
action. To bring about such an organization of ideas demands 
that from day to day the new facts or principles that are learned 
be consciously related to the old. It will not be economical 
to put off all reviewing until the end of the month, or quarter, 
or term. The step taken in advance to-day can be properly 
appreciated only when it is seen in relation to that which has 
gone before; and the work of the past week or month will, in 
turn, by this additional effort be seen in truer perspective. 
There are, however, convenient units into which subjects 
naturally divide themselves; and when one of these units has 
been completed, it may be well to take a period or two for 
the express purpose of review. We may then clear up any 
misconceptions, give a chance for additional verification and 
application of the knowledge thus far gained. It cannot be 
too strongly emphasized that the review which really counts 
is one in which the teacher works with the children, guides 
them and instructs them, rather than sits in judgment over 
them. There is nothing more disastrous to the best type of 
work than the idea on the part of children that the review les- 
son is the teacher’s opportunity to ask catch questions, or to 
overemphasize unimportant details. Children respond very 
quickly in such a situation by their endeavor to cram, with 
little or no effort at organization, all of the facts that they 
have been taught. 
A convenient stimulus to the proper sort of review is found 
in the requirement that pupils prepare en abstract or topical 
outline of the ground which has been covered, and submit it, 
preferably from memory, for class criticism and discussion. If 
the teacher asks questions, she should be very careful to see 
that they are questions of large scope which demand organiza- 
tion, or still better the application of organized knowledge. 
This brings us to the problem of testing. j { The only adequate test of school education, as of all other
-P-A-G-E-117
  Review or Examination Lesson 103 
education, is action. The nearer we can in our tests reproduce 
the conditions which will confront the child in actual life, the 
better. Not that we can always have him actually present 
in the situation; but when that is impossible, we can present 
for his consideration ideal situations which correspond to those 
which he will later find. The possibilities of presenting pre- 
cisely the test which he will meet and is meeting in life are, I 
believe, much greater than most examiners suspect. We 
have discovered after many years that the best test of a child’s 
ability to spell in the only situation in which he will ever need 
to spell is to test him in that situation ; i.e. by judginghis ability 
in writing words in connected discourse. The way to discover 
whether one can speak or write grammatically is to listen to him 
speaking or reading what he has written, and not to ask him to 
recite rules of grammar. The only real test of a child’s ability 
to give adequate oral expression to the story or poem is to see 
whether or not he can make clear the thought and furnish 
enjoyment to others, preferably to those who have not before 
heard the selection which he reads. We can assure ourselves 
that we have awakened an interest in literature and history, 
when we know that children read good books other than those 
which we compel them to read. The success of manual work, 
the time spent in art or music, ought certainly to be measured 
by ability to make and to decorate, the singing of songs, and 
the desire to hear music, or to see pictures. The more occa- 
sions that can be found for the application of the arithmetic we 
teach in actual measurements and computations which have 
real significance to children, the better will children under- 
stand their work, and the more certain we can be of their fu- 
ture efficiency.! It is coming to be a recognized principle of 
nature study that the common things, the animals and plants 
which are significant for our living, are the ones which should

School,” Teachers College Record, Vol. IV, No. 2; D. E. Smith, “The Teaching 
of Arithmetic,” Teachers College Record, Vol. X, No. 1.
-P-A-G-E-118
  104 A Brief Course in the Teaching Process 
engage our attention; and we expect that children will, on 
account of the teaching, enjoy more, take better care of, and 
utilize to better advantage the plant and animal life with which 
they come in contact. Even in such subjects as history and 
geography, one can hope to find just such applications while 
the child is studying as are apt to occur in his later life. The 
presentation of the results of the study of a country to a school 
assembly with the aid of pictures and a lantern, or the inter- 
pretation of current events in the light of their geographic 
setting will afford no mean test of the children’s knowledge of 
geography. The comparison of to-day’s happenings in the 
light of the events of a decade or a century ago; the explana- 
tion of the historical reference in the period devoted to litera- 
ture; the writing and presentation of a historical drama, will 
afford as great application of one’s knowledge as most of us 
ever make. 
Work of the sort indicated above will not only serve to test 
the value of the work that children have done, but will also 
add greatly to the interest and enthusiasm with which children 
do their work. We can scarcely hope that all examinations 
will satisfy this ideal; but of this we can be sure, the more 
work of this kind we do with our pupils, the firmer will be their 
grasp upon their work and the greater is apt to be their power 
to satisfy even less adequate tests. 
Examinations have another function which we as teachers 
should not overlook. Any adequate test of children’s abilities 
is also a test of our teaching. It will probably not be best for 
us to try to defend ourselves by pleading the inadequacy of 
the test, nor the backwardness of the pupils when they come 
to us, nor their parentage, nor any other less common reason. 
If children do not write as well as they should, if they misspell 
words they commonly use in their written work, if they can- 
not tell the story, recite the poem, solve the problem, descrihe 
the geographical area, or relate the events of the historic 
period, we had better inquire whether we have helped them
-P-A-G-E-119
  Review or Examination Lesson 105 
to work to best advantage, whether we have clearly dif- 
ferentiated the several aspects of our work and have then 
applied the methods suitable to accomplish the desired result. 
There may be mistakes made, but, all things else being equal, 
the teacher who gets results is the best teacher. 
We shall do better work, children, teachers, and supervisors, 
when we have provided for our use more definite standards 
or scales by which to measure our results. There is no reason 
why we should not have a scale which would enable us to tell 
with a fair degree of accuracy just what the standing of this 
group of children is in writing, in ability to perform the funda- 
mental operations in arithmetic, in spelling, in writing com- 
positions, in discussing the geography of North America, in 
decorating a cover for a notebook, or in any other subject or 
aspect of their school work. Beginnings have been made in 
this direction, and we may hope for more as time passes.! 
As these units of measure are perfected and applied in examin- 
ing the results of school work, we will, of course, hear the cry 
of those who will tell us that the best things that a teacher 
does cannot be measured. The obvious reply will be that 
efficiency in accomplishing results which can be measured need 
not in any way prevent a teacher from exercising that influence 
or doing that sort of work which is not recorded on examination 
sheets. Rather it will be found, I venture, that the efficient 
teachers, as measured by the results which we can test, are, 
on the whole, the teachers that are doing the noblest work. 
/ Strength of personality, appreciation of child nature, a life 
“which by its example makes for truth and beauty in other lives, 
/ are qualities not uncommon in the teacher who is glad to be 
) judged by the results which pupils can demonstrate.

  CHAPTER X LE 
THE RECITATION LESSON 
THE recitation lesson as commonly conducted consists in 
having children tell what they have read in their textbooks. 
Sometimes the teacher accepts or even demands that the pupils 
recite by repeating the words of the book. Better teaching 
requires rather that they render the thought of the author in 
their own language. In this chapter we shall discuss some of 
the worthy ends which may be accomplished by such an ex- 
ercise, some of the common deficiencies in work of this type, 
and the modifications which are advisable in the light of the 
principles already enunciated. 
The recitation lesson commonly tests the pupil’s memory 
for facts. The questions asked and answered serve to reveal 
to the teacher the knowledge or lack of it on the part of the 
pupil. In a way this testing also gives the teacher some idea 
of the amount of work done by the pupil. The great weakness 
of work of this kind is found in the tendency to demand and 
to accept words, the rehearsing of facts unrelated and unor- 
ganized. Of course this need not be true, since it is entirely 
within the power of the teacher to frame her questions in 
such a way that the pupil’s grasp on the whole topic rather 
than his memory for isolated facts is tested. 
The recitation which tests the pupil’s ability to present in 
orderly fashion the substance of the thought found in the 
sections assigned in the book for study is of genuine value. 
The topical recitation affords an opportunity to develop on 
the part of children the ability to stand on their feet and speak 
to a question for some minutes. And it may be suggested in 
this connection that we should develop more power of this sort 
107 
   
-P-A-G-E-122
  108 A Brief Course in the Teaching Process 
than is commonly found in our schools. The ability to express 
one’s self adequately on the topic under consideration will 
always make for effectiveness in social life. It would be well 
to test the progress of our pupils from grade to grade by their 
ability to speak more effectively and for a longer period as 
they advance through the school, on some topic connected 
with their school work. 
When pupils are required not simply to recite on some topic 
which is presented for their consideration, but are required 
to furnish their own outline and to recite on the basis of their 
own organization of the selections which they have read, the 
recitation may become a valuable exercise in thinking. The 
success of work of this kind will depend upon the definiteness 
with which the problem or aim of the work has been provided. 
Tt will not require much thought simply to follow the paragraph 
headings or marginal notes of the author and to present the 
organization as a basis for recitation. If, however, a problem 
has been suggested the solution of which may be found in 
the pages assigned for study, then the recitation may test the 
pupil’s power to analyze and organize the material which the 
book provides. And this is the only test of a thorough 
mastery of the book. We do not read to find out everything 
that an author says. Our needs may demand a very different 
ordering of facts, we may use factsin entirely new relations, and 
may ignore much that was essential from a different point of 
view. Children have read their textbooks thoroughly when 
they have derived from these texts the facts or ideas which are 
essential in the solution of their problem, the satisfaction of the 
aim which they hope to realize. 
This ability to use to best advantage a book is a very valu- 
able accomplishment. When the recitation lesson accom- 
plishes this result, it justifies its use. Too frequently we find 
adults who seem to feel that they must try to gather all of the 
knowledge and must try to follow none other than the author’s 
point of view in their reading. These persons read one book,
-P-A-G-E-123
  The Recitation Lesson 109 
and, as a result, believe one theory. It seems not to disturb 
them greatly that the next book they read takes the opposite 
point of view and that they range themselves on that side of 
the question. Books are, or at least ought to be, our servants, 
not our masters, and in the handling of books in his regular 
school work the child ought to come to realize their true 
function. There is no greater proof of a lack of thought than 
the ready acceptance of whatever one finds in print. 
There is great danger in the use of textbooks that children 
and teachers will become satisfied with words, that they will 
come to think that the repetition of the formula of the text- 
book is proof of knowledge. Textbooks are all too often 
merely books of texts. They have been made frequently 
enough by those who possess a very wide knowledge of the field 
in which they write; and by some strange process of thought 
they have apparently reached the conclusion that the way to 
make a subject simple is to condense it. Many of our most 
used textbooks are merely summaries or outlines of the subject 
treated. They lack richness of detail, and state conclusions 
instead of furnishing a large number of experiences, from which 
one may, through processes of logical thought, derive the gener- 
alizations of the subject. Take, for example, most of the text- 
books in history for elementary schools, and read carefully 
upon any topic selected at random, and then ask yourself just 
what these words mean to twelve-year-old children; or, better 
still, ask these children who repeat so glibly the words or re- 
produce the statements of the book just what they mean by 
the words they use. ‘Try to discover whether they have any 
adequate knowledge of facts, or any command of images, 
which would make possible the generalizations which they give 
as a result of the process of thought. Remember that a text- 
book is not logical for children because it has been logically 
arranged by the scholar. The test is rather to be found in the 
pupil’s ability to reproduce in his own thinking the steps which 
| have made possible the conclusions of the author.
-P-A-G-E-124
110 A Brief Course in the Teaching Process 
Any wide-awake teacher can make her work more interesting 
and more significant for children, if she will carefully provide 
for the enrichment of the text. The sources from which data 
can be gathered, regardless of the subject under consideration, 
are almost without number. Especially to be recommended 
are the standard works in the subjects. It will be interesting 
to discover that children would rather read Parkman than to 
study the text in which some less competent person has en- 
deavored to tell his story in a few paragraphs which mean 
absolutely nothing to the child. ‘The magazines which publish 
articles of wide social interest will furnish much helpful 
material. There is no school that may not greatly enrich its 
work by an appeal to the actual experiences of the children 
and by carefully directed observations and experiments. We 
need our textbooks as a summary, as a convenient condensed 
outline, or as books of reference; but we must provide as 
best we can other books of reference which will furnish the 
details which are impossible in the limited number of pages 
allowed to the text. In every room of every school a 
library of books, pamphlets, magazine articles, and illustra- 
tive material should be found, and every teacher should expect 
to increase this collection and to improve its quality as the 
years go by. 
It will give new meaning to notebooks and note-taking, if 
both teacher and children realize that the books thus prepared 
are a real addition to the texts used. A comparison of the 
work done by different members of the class will add interest 
in the work. One of the greatest deficiencies of the recitation 
lesson is the danger that nothing new will be presented. It is 
not intellectually stimulating to listen to others who repeat 
simply the thought with which you are already familiar. 
Where good notebook work is done and reported upon, the 
chance for new ideas, the stimulus to thought, through the 
presentation of new material, will greatly strengthen the work. 
A tendency in work of this type to accept vague and in- 
 
-P-A-G-E-125
  The Recitation Lesson 1I\ 
definite answers is another argument against the recitation 
lesson which consists merely in rehearsing the words of the 
book. Statements are apt to be vague when ideas are vague, 
and we may not expect ideas to be very clear when the child 
lacks experience. The child’s power of expression, aside 
from the difference in original talent in this direction, is con- 
ditioned first of all by his acquaintance with things and pro- 
cesses. The recitation lesson, as it is ordinarily conducted, 
gives little opportunity for this sort of firsthand knowledge. 
To work at the sand table, to construct with wood, clay, paper, 
or yarn, to experiment, and to observe carefully the working 
of nature may mean more for the command of language than 
much more time devoted to so-called language lessons. But 
the effective use of such experience for language growth de- 
pends in a measure upon the requirement that the teacher 
makes for adequate expression. The teacher who accepts the 
vague and indefinite answer encourages slovenly habits of 
expression and incidentally slovenly habits of thought. It is 
usually a mistake to say to a child: “I know what you mean 
even though you have not said it.’ Children are often lazy 
enough to allow the teacher to do their thinking for them, if 
the teacher willingly accepts the burden. Thinking is neces: 
sary for expression; language is the tool of thought; we can 
do no greater service to children than te hold them for what 
they say, give them credit for the thought which they express 
and no more. Words for children, as well as for adults, are 
used to conceal ignorance as well as to reveal thought. A child 
is quick to take advantage of the teacher who will accept any 
sort of an answer and interpret it as a statement containing 
thought. Indeed, it is possible that a child may even come to 
think that his incoherent statements, his word juggling, really 
represent thought. 
“Another danger in the recitation lesson is found in the 
tendency to develop the purely individualistic attitude. If 
excellence consists in endeavoring to repeat more of the book 
 
-P-A-G-E-126
  112 A Brief Course in the Teaching Process 
statement than any one else, manifestly it is your advantage 
to hinder rather than to help others in their work. The 
attitude of excessive competition on the one hand, and of in- 
difference on the other, are both avoided when children work 
together for common ends. The standard of the school should 
be codperation and helpfulness. 
The recitation lesson in its least desirable aspects will not 
disappear until all of our teachers realize that teaching does 
not consist in hearing lessons. The broader the training of 
the teacher, the better her understanding of child nature and 
of the meaning of education, the less likely is she to resort to 
this method to any considerable degree. We shall, it is true, 
so long as we use textbooks, take occasion to discover what use 
children have made of them ; but this testing will be incidental 
to our teaching, and not the sum and substance of it.

home land. All Puritans were agreed in wishing for a freer government than 
they had had in England under the Stuart kings, and in state matters were 
really the liberals of their time. In religious matters, however, they were not 
all of one mind. Some of them wished to make only a few changes in the 
church. These were called Non-Conformists. Others wished to make so many 
changes in religion that they could not stay in the English State Church. These 
were called Separatists. The settlers of Plymouth were Separatists; the 
settlers of Boston and neighboring towns were Non-Conformists.”” 
“Unlike the poor humble Pilgrims were the founders of Massachusetts. 
‘They were men of wealth and social position, as, for instance, John Winthrop 
and Sir Richard Saltonstall. They left comfortable homes in England to 
found a Puritan state in America. They got a tract of land extending from 
the Merrimac to the Charles, and westward across the continent. Hundreds 
of colonists came over in the year 1629-1630. They settled Boston, Salem, 
and neighboring towns. In the next ten years thousands more joined them. 
From the beginning Massachusetts was strong and prosperous. Among so 
many people there were some who did not get on well with the rulers of the 
colony.” ! 
Professor Johnson asks, “Do the children see or feel anything but 
words? Do they see Puritans? Do they see anything that the Puri- 
tans might change or any reason for changing it? Do they see any- 
thing that happened in America? ... But what do the words 
actually tell about the circumstances of the Puritans? ... Can any 
one think that such statements really convey information about the 
Puritans to one who is being introduced to them for the first time?” ?

  CHAPTER XI 
QUESTIONING 
In all teaching much depends upon the skill with which the 
teacher stimulates and guides the class by means of the ques- 
tions which she asks. Occasionally one finds a teacher who 
seems to think that the sole purpose of questioning is to test 
the knowledge of her pupils. She asks hundreds of questions 
which can be answered merely by an appeal to the memory. 
This sort of testing is valuable for review, but it does not neces- 
sitate thought. When a teacher habitually asks these fact 
questions, the children respond by trying to remember the 
words or the facts given in their books. | 
A type of question still less worthy is the direct question, — 
the one that can be answered by yes or no. The teacher who 
asks, ‘Is Albany on the Hudson River?” does not expect the 
children to think. If they are fairly bright, they will probably 
guess from her inflection whether the answer is yes or no. 
In any event, after one guess has been made there is only one 
alternative, and the pupil who answers second often deceives 
both the teacher and himself into thinking that he really knew 
the answer. The question which suggests an alternative is 
in effect the same as a direct question with its alternative 
answer of yes and no. ‘Does the earth turn on its axis from 
east to west or from west to east?” is no better than to ask, 
| “Does the earth turn on its axis from west to east ?”? Indeed, 
the alternative question in the example given is worse than 
the direct form, since it suggests a wrong answer which may 
make sufficient impression to confuse the pupils when the 
question arises again. 
114
-P-A-G-E-129
  Questioning 
The leading or suggestive question is much used by teachers 
who attempt to develop with children generalizations for which 
they have no basis in knowledge. It is perfectly possible to 
have children give some sort of expression to the most profound 
generalizations of science or philosophy, if one is only skillful 
in suggesting the answers which they are to give. As an ex- 
ample of this sort of questioning, the following is taken almost 
verbatim from a teacher who thought she was having her chil- 
dren think about the growth of plants. ‘Did you plant your 
flowers where the sun would shine on them? Do you think 
plants would grow in a very dark place? What do plants 
need to help them to grow? When the ground gets dry, what 
will you sprinkle on the ground to help the plants to grow? 
What do plants need besides light to make them grow? 
Would your plants grow if it was very cold? What do plants 
need besides light and moisture to make them grow?” If 
such a series of suggestive questions is asked, the responses 
will be prompt and the waving of hands most vigorous, but 
surely there has been very little necessity for thinking on the 
part of the children. This brings us to the crux of the whole 
problem. A question in order to be most stimulating must be 
of sufficient scope to demand that the experience of the chil- 
dren be organized anew with reference to the problem under _ 
consideration. 4 
The teacher who wants to test the quality of her questions 7 
ought frequently to ask herself whether her questions are of — 
sufficient scope. If all the children can answer every question 
asked immediately, the questions have not been very success- 
ful from the standpoint of provoking thought. It takes time 
to think. The question of large scope will be followed, not 
by a wild waving of hands, but rather by a period of quiet 
reflection. The teacher who was trying to have her pupils 
think about the conditions of plant growth should have asked 
one or two thought-provoking questions instead of the larger 
number of suggestive questions. She might have put the fol-   
  5   
 
-P-A-G-E-130
  116 A Brief Course in the Teaching Process 
lowing questions: What have you known any one to do to get 
good, strong, healthy plants? Would it be possible to change 
any of these conditions and still have the best plants? What 
is necessary for the growth of plants? If questions similar to 
the above are asked, one might naturally expect children to 
relate and to compare experiences, in fact, to solve the prob- 
lem by bringing to bear as best they could the facts concerning 
plant growth which had been observed in their experience. If 
the teacher wants the children to get some adequate idea of a 
mountain, in their work in home geography she might tell 
them about it or read them a description; but even after the 
best description she would want to question them in order to. 
have them think about the facts which had been given. She 
might ask: How long do you think it would take a man to 
walk to the top of a mountain? What would be the difficulties 
in getting to the top? If you stood on the top and threw a 
stone, how far down the mountain do you think it would go? _ 
» To ask good questions takes careful thought and planning 
‘on the part of the teacher. A half dozen thoroughly good 
questions often make a recitation a most stimulating exercise 
in thinking, while the absence of this preparation on the part 
of the teacher not infrequently results in the ordinary listless 
class period, which may actually be harmful from the stand- 
point of the child’s intellectual growth. It would be well for 
every teacher to ask herself the following questions when she 
is dissatisfied with the results of her teaching: Were my 
questions clear and concise? Did they challenge the attention 
of all the members of the class? Did the children need to

Did each child have a chance to answer? Did the children 
ask questions ?— When children are active mentally, they will 
have questions to ask. 
In asking questions much depends upon the novelty of the

form in which the question is put or of the issue which is 
presented. The writer has enjoyed asking several groups of 
teachers why they teach. The answers have been most varied, 
and on the whole indicate the real attitude of these men and 
women toward their work. A very different response is se- 
cured, however, when you ask the same groups to define the 
aim of education. They will all profess that they hope to 
realize the aim of education in their teaching, and that it is 
because they hope to participate in the development of socially 
efficient men and women that they teach; always provided 
you have asked a question concerning the aim of education. 
The difference in the two situations is accounted for by the 
difference in the wording of the question. In the one case 
these teachers really asked themselves the question — why do I 
teach? They answered in terms of their experience. Some 
taught for money, some because it was a respectable calling, 
some for want of anything better to do, some because they liked 
children, and some because of their appreciation of the signifi- 
cance of education in our modern democratic society. In the 
other case, the answers were given in words conveying ideas 
which were supposed to be those most acceptable to the teacher. 
It is often helpful to state the opposite of the common ex- 
pression of a generalization and to suggest that you are willing 
to maintain this point of view. The best lesson that the writer 
ever conducted on induction and deduction was begun with 
the statement: ‘Induction always begins with a generaliza- 
tion and moves to the consideration of particulars. Deduction 
always begins with a particular and moves to a generalization.” 
The class was excited because the usual form of expression had 
been reversed, and, before the period was over, did some think- 
ing about the commonly accepted definitions of induction and 
deduction. These definitions had really been nothing but a lot 
of words to juggle with, rather than the embodiment of clear 
ideas. This method of shock through the unfamiliar form of 
the question, or by means of a statement which challenges
-P-A-G-E-132
  hei (\ 118 A Brief Course in the Teaching Process 
attention because it is seemingly contrary to the accepted for- 
mula, is one of the surest means available to the teacher who 
would stimulate thought. 
It may be objected by some teacher that the form of ques- 
tion indicated above gives little or no place to the necessary 
reciting from books; that when one wants to discover whether 
the pupils have studied carefully the content of a text, the 
one way to be sure is to ask the fact question. In reply, it 
may be said that questions which call for the use or organiza- 
tion of facts demand not only the knowledge demanded by the 
fact question, but the more significant use of these data. It is 
true that some teachers still hear lessons. On the whole, there 
is too much telling of what the book says and too little teach- 
ing. The skillful teacher, in the assignment of her lesson, will 
give the children problems concerning which they can find 
information in their books. ‘The recitation will demand the 
answer to the questions that have been put previously, as 
well as to such other questions as may be necessary in the 
development of these problems. If the book is to be given a 
larger place, the recitation may be topical. Here, again, the 
large topics which are assigned should demand not a repetition 
of the headings and paragraphs of the book, but rather the out- 
line furnished by the teacher, or, better still, made by the class ; 
should necessitate a reorganization of the material of the text. 
There is little use in trying to furnish children with the knowl- 
edge of an encyclopedia. They will forget all except that 
which has become part of a system or scheme of ideas which 
have meaning and significance because of their organization. 
It is true that facts are the raw material of thinking, and it is 
equally true that those facts which have had some place in our 
thinking are the ones which we retain for future use. 
v-Aside from the form of the question, the teacher must con- 
sider the technique of questioning. One of the most common 
mistakes is to call on the bright children almost to the exclusion 
of the less capable. The writer has repeatedly followed closely
-P-A-G-E-133
  Questioning 11g 
the distribution of questions among the members of a class, 
only to discover that often from one fourth to two thirds of 
the class were not called upon at all, and that generally three 
fourths or more of the questions were addressed to a very small 
number of children. Most teachers would find it interesting to 
keep a record for a few days of the number of questions assigned 
to each child. Such a score would help to explain the lack of 
interest and backwardness of some pupils. dy, 2 
One hesitates to suggest that questions should not be given 
to the pupils in any regular order from the beginning to the end 
of the class by rows of seats or otherwise. Of course the teacher 
who does this notifies the members of the class that they need 
not be troubled about the work until their turn comes. Almost 
as bad, from the standpoint of maintaining the feeling of re- 
sponsibility by the whole class, is the method of asking ques- 
tions which prefixes the question with the name of the child 
who is to answer. When the teacher says, ‘‘ George, will you 
summarize the points which have just been made,” John, 
Henry, Mary, Catherine, and all the rest realize that there is 
nothing for them to do. The teacher should rather announce 
her question, and then wait long enough for all to be active 
before calling on any one. Ra uty 
Another source of lack of attention is found in the question “~ 
which is repeated. Children soon come to know whether they 
must listen when the question is first put, or whether they may 
wait until the second or third statement before they will be 
called upon. There is another weakness often shown in re- 
peating questions, viz.: the question is varied in form, which, 
in some cases, leads to confusion in the minds of attentive 
pupils, or the different forms used enable the child to guess the 
answer which is desired. To repeat questions is to acknowl- 
edge either that the form in which it was first put was not 
good or that the children were not expected to attend to the 
first statement of the problem. Either alternative will be 
avoided by a thoughtful, well prepared teacher. 
 
-P-A-G-E-134
  120 A Brief Course in the Teaching Process anwar 
The besetting sin of most teachers is the practice of repeat: 
ing the answers given by children. If the recitation is a place 
where children are to discuss their problems together, then 
every answer should be addressed to the whole class, not to the 
teacher. The teacher who repeats each answer cannot expect 
the children either to recite to the class or to pay attention to 
the one who is speaking. » Here is another chance for an inter- 
esting experiment. Score one every time you repeat an answer, 
and then try to see how soon you can eliminate this bad habit. 
It is often helpful to stand or sit in some part of the room not 
directly in front of the class. The fact that the teacher is 
among the class, one of them at least in position in the room, 
will make it somewhat easier for children to talk to the whole 
group. This habit of repeating the answer really grows out 
of the feeling which so many teachers have that the function 
of questions is to test for facts, and that in the recitation the 
answer should be addressed to the teacher and given by her 
to the class so that all may be made aware of the correct answer. 
The position which has been maintained is that the main pur- 
pose of questioning is to stimulate thought. Even if questions 
were mainly useful as a means of testing for facts, it would still 
be unwise to repeat the answers. 
Questioning by the teacher which does not lead to the asking 
of questions by pupils is unsatisfactory. If the children are 
thinking, really trying to solve the problem at issue, they will 
have questions of their own. If any single test were to be 
applied to the strength of the teacher’s questions, this would 
probably be best. Needless to say, the questions which chil- 
dren ask should, as a rule, be addressed to the class, or to some 
one member of the class, and not to the teacher. Some of the 
best lessons are those which end with children’s questions still 
unanswered, these problems furnishing the point of departure 
for the study which is to precede the next day’s work. 
If any one thinks that questioning is a simple matter, one 
that deserves less consideration than has been given to it, let
-P-A-G-E-135

him sit down and write four or five good questions which might 
be used in teaching a first-grade lesson on the dog ; a fifth-grade 
lesson on the Southern states; a seventh-grade lesson on mak- 
ing jelly; or a high school class on the law of gravity. The 
teacher who will get some one to write down for her the ques- 
tions which she asks in a single recitation will be surprised 
both at the number (it will be almost unbelievably large) and 
the quality of the product. 
There is nothing more searching than to attempt to write 
down beforehand the half dozen or more pivotal questions 
which are to be used in a recitation. When the attempt is 
made, any weakness in knowledge, in organization of subject 
matter, or in appreciation of the pupil’s point of view with 
relation to the material to be presented, will become apparent. 
There is no one thing that a teacher can do which will bring a 
greater reward in increased teaching power, than systematically 
to prepare questions for one or more recitations each day. If 
the writer could be sure that any group of teachers would try 
conscientiously to improve in the art of questioning, he would 
be just as sure that these same teachers would be rated by any 
impartial critic as superior to those who are willing to trust 
to inspiration in this most important part of the teacher’s work.

old ballads has been given before. The text used was Seward, Narra- 
tive and Lyric Poems, pp. 20-35. 
Teacher: Before we begin to talk about modern ballads, let’s see 
what you got from your first impression of the old ballads last time. 
In the first place, give four or five subjects that the old ballad writers 
were especially interested in. 
Pupil: Fighting, principally, and some romance. 
Teacher: What do you mean by romance? 
Pupil: Romance — that is all. 
Teacher: People meant different things — fighting, or love —do you 
mean love ? 
Pupil: No, fighting — romance. (Teacher writes on board “ ro- 
mance.”) That is about all I know, in the first — old ballads; oh, yes, 
one gruesome one, about c—. 
Teacher: Corbies ? 
Pupil: Yes. 
Teacher: Horror, perhaps. 
Pupil: Yes. 
Teacher: Elsworth? 
Elsworth: It only happened once, — lovers separated and met again. 
Teacher: Yes. (Writes “Fighting, Tales of Horror, Shipwreck, Parted 
Lovers.”) Is that a fair list? Ishould think so. Let us see about the 
spirit in which they were written, that is, the kind of qualities the people 
in those ballads showed, and the kind of qualities in human nature 
people of that day liked. 
Pupil: I think bravery. 
Teacher (writing “ bravery”): Anything else? 
Pupil: A hero and a villain. 
Teacher: Hero and villain; in other words, you take sides? 
Pupil: Yes. 
Teacher: What other qualities besides bravery ?
-P-A-G-E-137
  Questioning 123 
Pupil: Treachery, of the kind in the ballad of Johnnie Armstrong. 
Teacher: Yes, and the hero shows what quality ? 
Pupil: He believes in the king even when he is summoned before 
him. 
Teacher: Good faith on one side, and treachery on the other. Any- 
thing else ? 
Pupil: Honor. 
Teacher: Honor, yes. (Writes “ honor.”) 
Pupil: A great deal of honor among themselves. 
Teacher: Loyalty to each other; and as regards their enemies, what ? 
Pupil: They used to fight for fun, and they had certain rules; they 
were not really angry, they had to keep certain rules. 
Teacher: In other words ? 
Pupil: They couldn’t do just as they wanted to. 
Teacher: There were rules of honor even toward your enemy, a sort 
of amateur spirit. 
Pupil: Courtesy to their enemies. 
Teacher: Courtesy, — and perhaps we might say this includes being 
true to the rules. Could we say anything about the style in which 
these poems were written, kind of language, and kind of verse form? 
Pupil: Could be put to music. 
Teacher: Easy to sing, for one thing ? 
Pupil: Yes. 
Teacher: Complicated tunes, or simple ? 
Pupil: Simple. 
Teacher: How about the words, the English ? 
Pupil: Old English and Scotch. 
Teacher: Old English and Scotch; easy or hard to understand ? 
Pupil; After you have read two or three, I don’t think it is hard. 
Teacher: If you had been an old Scotchman of those times, should 
you say they were written in hard or easy language ? 
Pupil: Simple, — quaint. 
Teacher: Simple and quaint — old-fashioned. Let us turn to the 
ballads you had for to-day; see how they compare with these old ones. 
The first one, Lord Ullin’s Daughter —as regards the subject matter, 
is it the kind of story you think would appeal to ancient writers ? 
Pupil: It seems so; this one was about an elopement, they seem to 
write that kind of story. 
Teacher: Anything else ? 
Pupil: Shipwreck. 
Teacher: Do you think the old ballad writers would have been satisfied 
with the way the story came out? 
 
-P-A-G-E-138
  124 A Brief Course in the Teaching Process 
Pupil: I don’t think so; they liked to-see their side win; the lovers 
won in this case, but were drowned; I don’t think they would have 
liked it that way. 
Teacher: If they are going to get away from the father, they ought 
to get away clear. I think that is true; things end simply in the old 
ballads, it is an out-and-out tragedy or a happy ending. 
Pupil: They had some death, like Johnnie Armstrong, where the hero 
was killed. 
Teacher: How was he killed ? 
Pupil: By treachery. 
Teacher: Was there any here ? 
Pupil: No. 
Teacher: Were they killed through anybody’s fault, or by accident ? 
Pupil: By accident. 
Teacher: How is it in the old ballads ? 
Pupil: In the first stories they were not, —a shipwreck. 
Teacher: But in most cases it is a matter of somebody’s treachery. 
In Sir Patrick Spence who gets drowned ? 
Pupil: The Scotch nobles. 
Teacher: There it is the lords and all those other fine noblemen. 
As far as the style goes in Lord Ullin’s Daughter, should you say that 
the story goes rapidly, as rapidly as possible, or should you say that if 
an old ballad singer were telling the siory, there is something that could 
be left out ? 
Pupil: I think so. 
Teacher: Can you see any group of verses that could be left out 
without breaking the story up? 
Pupil: I think where it described the boat (reads) : — 
“The boat has left a stormy land, 
A stormy sea before her — 
When, oh! too strong for human hand, 
The tempest gather’d o’er her.” 
Those descriptions could be left out; and (reads) : — 
“For sore dismay’d, through storm and shade, 
His child he did discover : — 
One lovely hand she stretch’d for aid, 
And one was round her lover.” 
Teacher: You think the picture of how she looked in the boat does 
not count ? 
Pupil: 1 like it, but it could have been left out.
-P-A-G-E-139
  Questioning 125 
Teacher: The old ballad singers would have left out that part. Are 
there things in the earlier part of the poem that could be left out if you 
just wanted the story ? 
Pupil: The first verse. 
Teacher: Better if they got started at once, perhaps. Miss Weiss ? 
Miss W.: The third verse: — 
“And fast before her father’s men 
Three days we’ve fled together, 
For should he find us in the glen, 
My blood would stain the heather.” 
He says right after that that the horses are right behind him, so he 
could have left that out. 
Teacher: He spends too much time in talking to the boatman, that is 
true. 
Pupil: The seventh verse. 
“ By this the storm grew loud apace, 
The water-wraith was shrieking ; 
And in the scowl of Heaven each face 
Grew dark as they were speaking.” 
Teacher: You can’t help wondering why they didn’t get in the boat, 
and stop talking. The old ballad writers pared it all down to nothing 
but the story. Turn to the next one, — Lady Clare; would that have 
pleased the old ballad writers ? 
Pupil: I think it would have. It is just the kind of love story they 
liked, — it all turned out well. 
Teacher: Turns out well in the end; and in it the lovers show what 
kind of qualities ? 
Pupil: Faithful. 
Teacher: You like that ? 
Pupil: Yes. 
Teacher: The sort of things anybody would like, all the admirable 
qualities of a good love story. I wonder if any one noticed the language 
f this poem, anything that would show that Tennyson was trying to 
imitate the language of the old ballads ? 
Pupil: “1 trow they did not part in scorn.” 
Teacher: “1 trow” — that sounds old-fashioned. Anything else ? 
Pupil: The way he brings in the nurse: — 
 
-P-A-G-E-140
  126 A Brief Course in the Teaching Process 
“In there came old Alice the nurse, 
Said, ‘Who was this that went from thee?” 
‘It was my cousin,’ said Lady Clare; 
“To-morrow he weds with me.’” 
And “thee” and “thou.” 
Teacher: How about the word “Said”’; has that any subject ? 
Pupil: “ Alice the nurse” is subject of both came and said. 
Teacher: Yes: anything else ? 
Pupil: The last of that verse, ‘To-morrow he weds with me.” 
Teacher: That sounds old-fashioned; anything else ? 
Pupil: Some of the repetition. 
Teacher: What line? 
Pupil: “Are ye out of your mind, my nurse, my nurse?” 
Teacher: And “Yet here’s a kiss for my mother dear, 
My mother dear, if this be so,” 
sounds like the kind of repetition a man would make on a guitar, or 
something like that. 
“Play me no tricks,’ said Lord Ronald, 
‘For I am yours in word and in deed. 
Play me no tricks,’ said Lord Ronald, 
‘Your riddle is hard to read.’” 
It comes again and again. When you come to Lucy Gray, a poem 
which was very famous, and which is, perhaps, a little hard to get the 
real spirit of at first; did any one feel especially attracted by that? 
Miss Graves? What did you like about it? 
Miss G.: It was entirely different from the others, —the way it 
turned out, — well, just the description in everything, — the snow, — 
then, it seemed to go easier than the others. 
Teacher: We have rather taken it for granted all along that all these 
were very easy, — easy to sing. 
Pupil: I don’t think the later ballads are nearly as easy to sing as 
others. 
Teacher: You think this Lucy Gray is different, you like the descrip- 
tive verses in it? Any special phrases or description that particularly 
struck you, Miss Graves ? 
Miss G.: I don’t see any just now — 
Teacher: Any one happen to remember any ? 
Pupil: “The minster-clock has just struck two.” 
Teacher: Miss Thibaut ?
-P-A-G-E-141
  Questioning 127 
Miss T.: “Her feet disperse the powdery snow, 
That rises up like smoke.” 
Teacher: “Her feet disperse the powdery snow, 
That rises up like smoke.” 
Would that be in place in one of the old ballads? They weren’t inter- 
ested in the appearance of the snow very much. Miss Weiss? 
Miss W.: I think I like this ballad because it leaves something to 
the imagination, the rest tell you everything; it doesn’t say surely that 
she is still alive, it leaves it to you to think about it. 
Teacher: Do you think Wordsworth himself thinks she is still alive? 
Pupil: I think he does; I don’t know if he does, but I think he does. 
Teacher: In this remote country region, the people who would main- 
tain that she was alive would be —? 
Pupil: The country people. 
Teacher: What is Wordsworth’s attitude ? 
Pupil: I don’t think he credits it very much; I think he respects it, 
but I don’t think he credits it. 
Teacher: He doesn’t tell you whether he expects you to believe it 
or not; but at any rate, there is a fineness of feeling toward the coun- 
try people that makes him respect the country superstition. 
Pupil: I think she must have been lost, because if she hadn’t, she 
might have come back to her mother and father. 
Teacher: Of course, your imagination there is piecing it out; Words- 
worth doesn’t tell you out and out that she was drowned. 
Pupil: I think he does; he says her footsteps stopped in the middle 
of the plank, and something must have happened there. 
Teacher: The actual drowning was not described; you cannot help 
feeling that in the old ballads they would have given you a full descrip- 
tion, like Sir Patrick Spence; the ballad ends how? 
Pupil: Wordsworth was not trying to imitate the old ballads, was 
he? 
Teacher: No; it is a good deal further away from the old ballads 
than the others we have had; it is a more imaginative poem, more beauty 
of phrasing and thought. Any other questions or comments about 
Lucy Gray? 
Pupil: I like this verse : — 
“They follow’d from the snowy bank 
Those footmarks, one by one, 
Into the middle of the plank; 
And further there were none.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-142
  128 A Brief Course in the Teaching Process 
Teacher: You think that is because of the things Wordsworth does 
not say, the fact that he keeps a certain amount to himself ? 
Pupil: Yes. 
Teacher: That quality of reticence, isn’t it? How is it in modern 
times; have you noticed how you respect people who do not say quite 
all they feel; they keep their deepest feelings largely to themselves, 
and you can only guess at it by what is left unsaid? Are the kind of 
people who are represented in this poem the sort of people you ordi- 
narily encounter in the old ballads ? 
Pupil: I don’t think we do; the chief characters were the nobles 
and barons, the highest people in England and Scotland. 
Teacher: These people were what ? 
Pupil: Common people. 
Teacher: You get that from what phrase in the poem? Any one? 
Pupil: Just after he asked her to go for her mother: “At this the 
father raised his hook ”’; he wouldn’t have done that if he hadn’t been 
a working man. 
Pupil: I don’t think he would have sent Luc, Gray after her mother 
in the snow; they would have been riding in a coach and four. 
Teacher: How is it with some of the other early writers? Was 
Shakespeare more interested in common people or wealthy ? 
Pupil: Wealthy.! 
The questions and answers quoted represent about two thirds of the 
work of a period. 
Note the number of questions, their scope, the amount of thought 
necessary on the part of the pupils, the explanations offered by the 
teacher, and the relative amount of talking done by teacher and pupils.

  CHAPTER XII 
SOCIAL PHASES OF THE RECITATION 
Empuasis has already been given to the social aim in educa- 
tion. This chapter will discuss in some detail the possibility of 
realizing this aim through the conduct of the recitation. The 
real advantage to be derived from grouping children in classes 
is found in the opportunity which is afforded for exchange of 
ideas. A group of children seated with faces to the front re- 
sponding to the teacher’s questions and anxious only for her ap- 
proval is an educational anomaly. The recitation is more than 
a place for the teacher to test the knowledge of the children, 
or to explain to them as a group some phase of their work 
with which they have had difficulty. It maybe well to inquire 
concerning the motives which operate, the activities present, 
and the results commonly achieved by the recitation. 
In many classes children seem to feel that the main purpose 
of the recitation is to please the teacher. Nor is the teacher’s 
attitude different. She praises or blames in proportion as the 
children answer her questions or follow her directions. Of 
course there are times when it is the main business of the 
teacher to test children or to direct their activity; but more 
commonly it is the office of the teacher to work as a member of 
a group who are working together for the realization of some 
worthy end. Both teacher and pupil should be pleased when 
progress is being made in the work at hand because of the 
active participation of all of the members of the group. 
There are other motives commonly operating which are 
even less worthy than that of pleasing the teacher. Children 
not infrequently are somewhat attentive to the work of the 
x 129 
 
-P-A-G-E-144
    130 A Brief Course in the Teaching Process 
class because they fear the punishment which follows failure. 
The more ambitious, on the other hand, come to look upon 
the recitation as an opportunity to display their superiority. 
They believe, and too often they are right, that the chief end of 
school work is to get ahead of some one else, — to get a higher 
mark. In each of the cases mentioned, the motive is essen- 
tially individualistic. Better have the boy at work in order 
to please the teacher than to have him idle; better use punish- 
ments and rewards and secure some results in knowledge and 
habits than to fail of these desirable ends: but the socializa- 
tion of the boy and the maximum of intellectual activity for 
each member of the group can only be brought about in a situa- 
tion which is genuinely social. 
What could be more natural than that children should ask 
each other questions; that they should exchange experiences ; 
that they should work in codperation for the satisfaction of a 
commonend? ‘This presupposes that they have a problem or 
purpose which is genuine. But that is only to assume that 
there is some real reason for intellectual activity. Or let us 
suppose that the children are at work in order that the product 
of their effort may be used in some social situation. It is not 
particularly difficult under such conditions to get the liveliest 
kind of discussion, to secure the most earnest codperation, or 
to have pupils themselves accept in a considerable measure 
the responsibility for progress in their work. 
This difference in attitude toward school work, if once es- 
tablished, is apparent in all subjects. The work of a class in 
reading or literature will be transformed when children work 
together to understand and appreciate its content. Instead of 
the complaint that John has lost the place, it will be discovered 
that he not infrequently has a question to ask, or that he can 
contribute an explanation. The writer has seen a class of 
third-grade children as active in questioning each other con- 
cerning a reading lesson as they were on the playground in in- 
quiring concerning the games they played or the novel expe- 
 
-P-A-G-E-145
  Soctal Phases of the Recitation 131 
riencesin which they wereinterested. The teacher had attained 
this result by making the children understand that they ought 
to ask each other questions when they did not understand the 
thought expressed in their books, and that one of the best ways 
to explain was to tell of a similar experience which they had had. 
In a class in nature study in a fourth grade a boy told a 
wonderful story of the activities of a squirrel. Ordinarily the 
teacher might have been expected to tell the boy that the story 
was untrue and that she did not want that kind of stories. In 
this class, however, the children felt responsible for the con- 
tributions which were made. The story had no sooner been 
told than the narrator was plied with questions. Where had 
he seen the squirrel? On what kind of a tree? What was the 
color of the squirrel? Just when did the events related hap- 
pen? The boy could not answer these questions satisfactorily, 
and finally admitted that his story had a very slight basis 
in fact. The rebuke thus administered by his classmates 
probably did more toward giving this boy respect for truth than 
a dozen statements by the teacher that his contribution was 
unsatisfactory. 
In an eighth-grade class the children were discussing the 
panic of ’73. One of the boys maintained that the causes 
of panics were, in general, the same, regardless of the ac- 
tivities of a few individuals occupying important positions 
in government or in the commercial world. His contention 
was mainly that it was unfair to charge a president or a politi- 
cal party with the distress occasioned by a panic, when in real- 
ity the cause was to be found in economic conditions over 
which neither president nor party had control. One of the 
girls in the class objected, and cited as proof the panic of 
37, which she claimed was caused by President Jackson. 
The teacher could have settled the question immediately by 
an authoritative statement, which most classes of children 
would have accepted. In this class, however, the teacher en- 
couraged the class to participate in the discussion. In the 
 
-P-A-G-E-146
    132 A Brief Course in the Teaching Process 
end the members of the class davies textbooks and othei 
more complete histories, and reached their own decision with 
comparatively little help from the teacher. The value of 
this work in history consisted mainly in the fact that the chil- 
dren, having once discovered the problem, felt responsible 
for its solution. They were engaged in the liveliest kind of 
thinking and discussion. They were learning where to go, 
and what materials to use in the solution of this kind of prob- 
lem. | 
Possibly work in the industrial arts offers the very best 
chance for group work. At every turn in work of this kind 
there is the demand for careful planning involving discussion of 
ways and means, and for codperation in the execution of the 
plan. A group of second-grade children were occupied most 
profitably with the partial furnishing and daily care of the 
teacher’s rest room. ‘They had first of all to decide what they 
could do to make the room more comfortable or more beautiful. 
They decided that they could make pillow, table, and couch 
covers, and window curtains, and that they could keep the 
room clean. In determining materials and design, as well as 
in the execution of the work itself, there was need for codpera- 
tion. The children gained not only in appreciation of some of 
the elements of home-making, but also in ability to plan and to 
work together. They were being socialized both by the con- 
tent of their work and by the method employed in executing it. 
Another group of children, fifth grade, spent a number of 
weeks working together in planning and building a playhouse 
for the first grade. A wide-awake teacher enlisted the codpera- 
tion of three grades in the making and selling of candy in order 
to get money enough to buy pictures for the school. The 
preparation of a picnic luncheon, or meal for guests invited by 
the cooking class, the making of a large rug from many smaller 
rugs woven in such a way as to contribute to the pattern of the 
final product, the building of window boxes, the writing of the 
account of an excursion or other school exercise in order that 
 
-P-A-G-E-147
  Social Phases of the Recitation 133 
the best results may be brought together in the final account 
which is to be used in a school paper, are examples of the kind 
of work which may involve the kind of activity which makes 
for present social efficiency, and, therefore, for that social effi- 
ciency which it is the ultimate purpose of education to achieve. 
One of the best ways to transform the recitation from a place 
where lessons are heard to an active social group is to plan 
definitely for a variety of contributions from the individual 
members or small groups of the class. When each member of 
the class studies the same pages of the same book, there is little 
incentive either to try to tell well what the book contributes 
to the problem in hand, or to listen to the recitation of one’s 
classmates. If, however, one group of children have been re- 
ferred to one book, another to a second book, and still another 
to a magazine article, to pictures, or other objective represen- 
tation, there is some reason why each should do his best in 
reporting, and a genuine motive for following closely the con- 
tribution of each member of the class during the recitation is 
provided. Work of this sort is easily available in history, 
geography, nature study, or manual training. 
In the subjects which seem to lend themselves less easily to 
variety in assignment, many possibilities will be found by the 
teacher who is anxious to prove the efficiency of this method. 
The best reading that the writer has ever seen in a third grade 
was done by children who read to each other. They used the 
readers in the school and books from home and from the public 
library. Each child was permitted to make a selection and 
submit it to the teacher for approval. Then came the period 
of preparation, extending often over two or three days or even a 
week. During this time the child was supposed to study the 
selection carefully, learn the pronunciation of difficult words, and 
practice reading the selection so that he might give pleasure 
to those for whom the reading was done. The one good reason 
for reading aloud is to read to an audience who cares to hear 
what you have to offer. These children were participating 
 
-P-A-G-E-148
  134 A Brief Course in the Teaching Process 
in a social situation which demanded much of them, and they 
enjoyed the hard work which was necessary because the motive 
back of it all was genuine. In arithmetic, if arithmetic deals 
with the quantitative aspect of the experiences which the chil- 
dren are having, it will be possible to allow for some variety. 
in the work which is assigned. If the problems are real, there 
will be a considerable interest manifested by the children in the 
solution of the problem and the results which are secured. 
Suppose a, class were given a list of the articles which are to be 
put in a Thanksgiving basket, with instructions to find the cost 
of the basket so that a friend may pay for one of the donations 
which the class plans to distribute. In such a situation the 
children will be most eager to compare prices and total cost 
when the class next meets for the arithmetic lesson. Of course 
the carping critic will say that it is easy to devise a few cases 
of the sort listed above, but that in real school work you 
haven’t time to make such plans. The only answer is that 
the difference between superior teaching and the kind that one 
sees all too commonly is found in the ability and willingness of 
the artistic teacher to be more nearly true to her ideals than 
are others. Any teacher, who is sufficiently interested, can 
find many situations in which Lie can vary the work of the 
class in such a way that the recitation period shall become a 
place where each member of the class brings his individual 
contribution. | 
Possibly the greatest need in our schools to-day is for more 
purposeful work for children. We are so much concerned 
about the many things which children ought to know that we 
are tempted to spend most of the time drilling children on facts 
which have very little meaning for them. The demand that 
the school be socialized is only another way of saying that the 
work of school children should function in the school itself and 
in their lives outside of school. It has seemed possible, in a 
few schools, to give children opportunity in the industrial 
arts to work at making something which they really want for
-P-A-G-E-149
  Social Phases of the Recitation 135 
themselves, or upon a project which may involve the welfare 
of the group, as, for example, when they work upon school 
apparatus or furniture. An eighth-grade group of boys made 
the furniture for the principal’s office; the children at Hyannis, 
Massachusetts, make baskets, brooms, hammocks, raise vege- 
tables, build a boat or a fence, as occasion demands.! At 
Tuskegee the more mature students have even burnt the 
bricks and constructed the buildings for the school. 
If a significant project in the industries is undertaken, it 
may furnish the motive for doing work along many lines. The 
raising of vegetables may involve arithmetic in the measuring 
of beds and the buying of seeds, in finding the value of the 
product, and, if the product be sold, in the keeping of a bank 
account. ‘The study of dairying might very well involve a visit 
to a farm; the measuring of an acre; the estimating of the 
cost of production of milk and butter; and the return from the 
investment. The cost and means of transportation might be 
studied; a churn, butter bowl, and paddle might be con- 
structed; and finally a complete account of these many ex- 
periences might be written and printed. If children are en- 
gaged in activities of this sort, there will be no question of socializ- 
ing the school. By the very nature of their activities children 
will be led to question each other and their teachers; they will 
of necessity codperate in those phases of the work which involve 
team work. 
But it is not in the industrial arts alone that school work 
may deal with genuine situations. A good teacher finds a 
hundred situations in which children can write for an audience. 
The writer recently attended the closing exercises of an ele- 
mentary school where the graduating class had composed a 
play which they presented. Themain plot of the story centered 
in a prize essay contest, and, as might be inferred, the essays 
which were read were those which the children had written dur- 
1 Baldwin, Industrial School Education. A most helpful discussion of indus- 
trial work. 
 
-P-A-G-E-150
  136 A Brief Course m i. Teaching Process 
ing the regular class work. In geography the members of a 
sixth-grade class prepared talks to accompany pictures thrown 
on the screen from a lantern. In history certain incidents of 
the period which a class was studying were dramatized and 
presented to the whole school. 
The president of a water company in a middle-western city 
told the writer that they kept things in better shape at the water 
works since they had agreed to allow the children to come to 
visit the waterworks whenever a teacher chose to bring a class. 
In the same city there is an unusual number of pianos in the 
schools, school playgrounds are being established, parents’ 
associations are active in codperation with the teachers to im- 
prove school conditions. If one were asked to explain why the 
schools in this city are better, why they are so loyally supported 
and so proudly spoken of by all classes of people, the answer 
would be found, I believe, in the fact that there is a closer 
relationship between the school and activities outside the school 
in home and city than in most other places. If teachers more 
commonly had in mind the needs of the children during the 
time they are not in the school, it would be easier to find situ- 
tions in which the school activities would be significant because 
of the genuine needs which are felt by the children. 
If there were nothing gained toward socializing children 
through activities involving the codperation of the whole group, 
the fact would remain that the best type of intellectual activ- 
ity can be secured only with this most genuine of all incentives. 
Most people, even as adults, think better when they have some 
one with whom to discuss the problem in hand. It is true, 
too, that often the best teacher is one whose experience is 
somewhat similar to our own and whose attitudes and difficul- 
ties are similar to ours. Children can often interpret where 
teachers fail. It cannot be too often reiterated that it is the 
chief business of every teacher to render her services unneces- 
sary. If the children taught are not at the end of any term’s 
work better able to work for themselves, more ready to take the
-P-A-G-E-151
  Social Phases of the Recitation 137 
initiative, more capable in defining their problems, in gather- 
ing data, and in finding solutions than they were at the begin- 
ning of the period, then the work has been a failure. Creative 
work! is not done when some one stands over the child and 
dictates his every step, nor does thinking consist in answering 
the questions which a teacher may put concerning the facts 
recorded in a text. There is entirely too much truth in the 
charge which is sometimes brought against our schools, that 
they fail to keep alive the intellectual activity which is natural 
to childhood. 
We must never lose sight of the fact that a child who is 
vigorous intellectually, actively sympathetic with those causes 
which make for the general welfare, and able and willing to 
work in codperation with others, even though this may mean that 
he subordinate himself to others for the time being, is the type 
of individual upon which our democracy depends for its per- 
petuation and for its future progress. It is necessary to em- 
phasize the social side of school life because we have, in our 
anxiety to impart information and form habits, neglected this 
aspect of school life. The pity of it all is that in neglecting the 
child’s social development we have done less efficient work in 
the fields we sought to emphasize because of the lack of genu- 
ine motive. Whether we are concerned with habits, with the 
acquisition of knowledge, with development in clear thinking, 
or in fixing ideals, the maximum of return will be secured in the 
genuinely social situation. Children working together on real 
problems are being socialized through participation in social 
activities. There is no other way in which the school can 
contribute so certainly to the accomplishment of the aim of 
all education.

  CHAPTER XIII 
THE PHYSICAL WELFARE OF CHILDREN 
INTELLECTUAL development, and more especially intellectual 
efficiency, are conditioned in no mean degree by one’s physical 
condition. Schools have too frequently, and with justice, 
been accused of producing physical defects in children. It is 
coming to be recognized that we must in increasing measure 
take account of the hygienic conditions under which school 
work is done, as well as provide for the elimination or ameliora- 
tion of physical defects. We now have open-air schools for 
consumptives, medical inspection, and dental clinics. There 
are some schools which provide school lunches at a nominal 
price or without cost to the pupils. Corrective physical 
training is coming to be recognized, along with special play- 
ground work. Everywhere appreciation of the importance 
of physical health as a condition prerequisite to intellectual 
vigor is leading those who have the welfare of the community 
at heart to demand that active measures be taken to protect 
and nourish the bodies of school children. It is the purpose of 
this chapter to indicate briefly the relation of teachers to this 
movement for physical well being. 
The demand that light be sufficient and that it come from 
the right direction is familiar to all teachers. It may be ar- 
gued that teachers cannot control the lighting of their rooms. 
The author has known teachers who have had blinds properly 
placed, walls and ceilings painted or papered with respect to 
proper distribution of light. Some teachers have even been 
instrumental in securing alterations in buildings or the erec- 
tion of new buildings. Teachers who know that the area of 
139 
 
-P-A-G-E-154
  140 A Brief Course in the Teaching Process 
windows should be one fourth of the floor space, that the light 
should be admitted from one side of the room, and that it 
should come over the children’s left shoulders, may not be 
able to meet all of these conditions; but they can do all that 
is possible to ameliorate defects, and can call attention to the 
dangers which the situation possesses for their pupils’ eyesight 
by giving or having given tests and making known the results. 
Modern school buildings are built with artificial ventilating 
systems. ‘The success with which any system works depends 
in no inconsiderable measure upon the teacher. By opening 
windows in one room the efficiency of the ventilation of all 
other rooms in the building may be impaired. Failure to note 
the temperature may mean that children and teacher are suffer- 
ing from a condition easily remedied by the janitor or engi- 
neer. Every teacher should have the temperature of her room 
recorded on the blackboard, where every one can see it, at least 
twice during each school session. Needless to say, the ther- 
mometer should be accurate, and, if possible, hung in the center 
of the room, not more than four or five feet from the floor. 
Teachers are responsible for right habits of posture. If seats 
need to be adjusted, the teacher should note the fact and notify 
the principal. Although special cases may demand expert 
advice and care, the teacher must hold herself responsible for 
the posture of the majority of the class. Defects of vision may 
be either the cause or the effect of improper position of the body, 
and should bring from the teacher an urgent appeal for careful 
examination and correction. Frequent rest periods should be 
provided, the habit of correct posture insisted upon, and simple 
corrective exercises given by the teacher. 
Schoolrooms are not infrequently the center of infection for 
the community. Any teacher can insist upon separate drink- 
ing cups, if sanitary fountains are not provided in the build- 
ing. When a child appears with a rash, with an abnormal tem- 
perature, and not infrequently with only a cough, the teacher 
should appeal to the principal, the health inspector, or others
-P-A-G-E-155
  The Physical Welfare of Children 141 
in authority for the elimination of the child from the group. 
The author has been in schoolrooms where two or three chil- 
dren in the incipient stages of whooping cough were allowed to 
infect the whole class. A school superintendent was distressed 
with what proved to be a veritable scourge of scarlet fever in 
one of his schools. Upon visiting the school he found one child 
on the playground proudly showing the other children how he 
could take flakes of skin from his arm. No one expects teach- 
ers to be expert diagnosticians, but any teacher should acquaint 
herself with the more common indications of childish diseases, 
and should act promptly when her suspicion is aroused, even 
though she prove to be wrong in half the cases. If anything 
is wrong, eliminate the child from the group, suggest that a 
physician be consulted, and await developments: this is the 
only safe rule. 
In addition to her activity in eliminating contagious diseases, 
the teacher may often be the first to detect deficiencies in sight 
or hearing. Children who are inattentive and apparently dull 
may often be found to hear indistinctly. A very simple test 
for hearing is to tap a pencil against a desk out of sight of the 
child, and ask him to tell how many taps he hears. Head- 
aches, squinting, the position in which the book is held, often 
indicate to the teacher eye deficiency which parents have not 
suspected. Any child who gives indications of eye trouble 
should be tested by teacher or principal, and, if any indications 
of difficulty are found, the parents should be urged to consult 
a competent oculist. 
Dr. William H. Allen gives the following suggestions to 
teachers who would discover cases of adenoids and enlarged 
tonsils : + 
“yz. Inability to breathe through the nose. 
“2. A chronically running nose, accompanied by frequent nose- 
bleeds and a cough to clear the throat. 
1 Allen, Civics and Health, p. 53.
-P-A-G-E-156
  142 A Brief Course im the Teaching Process 
“3, Stuffy speech and delayed learning to talk. ‘Common’ is pro 
nounced ‘cobbed,’ ‘nose,’ ‘dose,’ and ‘song,’ ‘sogg.’ 
“4. A narrow upper jaw and irregular crowding of the teeth, 
“5. Deafness. 
“6. Chorea or nervousness. 
“4, Inflamed eyes and conjunctivitis.” 
Any one who has known a child with a bad case of adenoids 
or enlarged tonsils, and who has followed the progress of the 
same child after the removal of the defect, will not think it 
too much trouble to insist that suspected cases receive the 
attention of a physician. In these cases, and where the child 
is suffering because of the ills superinduced by bad teeth, 
the teacher must work with the parents. Often through 
mothers’ clubs or parents’ associations, addressed by a physician 
and by teacher, the necessity for action, from a purely eco- 
nomic point of view, if from no other, can be impressed upon 
parents. It is possible that we shall have to resort to an 
appeal to private charity to save the child, or perhaps we shall 
in time have free compulsory dental, surgical, and medical 
clinics. 
The children are society’s greatest asset, from whatever point 
of view we consider them, and teachers should be most active 
in all movements which make for child welfare. There is no 
other group of people better acquainted with the needs of 
children, none other which stands in so strategic a position with 
relation to parents and the community at large. Parents 
should be taught the necessity of plenty of sleep, wholesome 
food, and clean skins for children. Better devote time and 
energy to this education of parents than attempt to teach 
children handicapped by the lack of proper living conditions. 
The anti-tuberculosis campaign, the pure milk crusade, the 
demand for medical inspection, should be earnestly supported, 
if not instituted, by the teachers of children, Health is not 
an individual matter. The welfare of the whole group is bound 
up in conditions which spell disaster for the individual.
-P-A-G-E-157
    The Physical Welfare of Children 143 
Finally the teacher has a right to good health. Living 
under bad hygienic conditions, with children who are unclean 
and diseased, should not be demanded of any teacher. The 
efficiency of the work which the teacher does, no less than that 
of the children, is conditioned by her health. If it is true that 
the teacher may suffer because of diseased children, it is none 
the less true that a teacher in poor physical condition injures 
all of the children she is pledged to help. Happy, healthful 
lives for children and teachers is a condition which will be 
brought to pass when all teachers work for this end.

  CHAPTER XIV 
MORAL TRAINING 
CuaractTer building must always be recognized as a most 
important function of the school. It is a mistake to divorce 
the intellectual training of children from growth in morality. 
If our country demands increased industrial intelligence, the 
training of men and women for leadership in manufacture, 
trade, and commerce, much more must it demand citizens 
of sterling character. Industrial and intellectual supremacy 
can mean nothing to a nation unless righteousness prevails 
both in public and in private life. The idea that the schools 
of our democracy are to train for citizenship has always been 
interpreted to mean an education which will fit for a life of 
service to the best interests of humanity. The fact that re- 
ligious instruction, as such, is barred from our schools, does 
not mean that we are as a people irreligious, much less that 
we undervalue the significance of the moral training of our 
children. 
School conditions offer advantages for moral training, even 
though the overemphasis on intellectual attainments may at 
times seem to give the teacher little opportunity for work in 
this direction. The fact of a group of children who may learn 
to work together, to help each other, to respect each other’s 
rights, to serve the best interests of the whole group, in fact 
a situation which demands just those virtues which are de- 
manded in society outside the school, makes the school in 
some respects an ideal situation for training in morality. Of 
course it is possible that the demand for intellectual attain- 
ment may so occupy the mind of the teacher that she will 
L 145
-P-A-G-E-160
  146 A Brief Course in the Teaching Process 
resort to repression in order to get results in habits and knowl- 
edge. It is true, too, that the curriculum may be so narrow 
as to give less opportunity than might be desired for the type 
of activity which best lends itself to the development of social 
virtues. But if adverse conditions hinder somewhat the work 
of the teacher, they cannot deny a very important place to the 
school in the formation of character. 
The increased responsibility of the school for the moral 
training of children becomes apparent at once when the in- 
fluence of the home and the church of to-day are contrasted 
with the strength which these institutions once possessed. 
Regret it as much as we may, neither home nor church is as 
potent in the development of morality as they once were. 
Before the dominance of the factory system the boy or girl 
who participated in the activities of the home gained in ap- 
preciation of necessity for codperation and in understanding 
of his responsibility to the group in a way that is denied the 
modern child. To be a party to those industries through 
which food was secured, clothing obtained, and shelter provided 
meant the exercise of all of the social virtues. It was fitting 
under such a régime that the school should devote itself 
largely to the tools of learning. But under our present con- 
ditions the demand is insistent that the school provide, in 
some measure, through its curriculum, its organization, and 
by means of its methods of instruction, for the development 
of the attitude of responsibility, and that positive morality 
which places a premium upon doing good. 
Let us inquire still more closely concerning the conditions 
under which moral training must be effected in the school. 
First of all there is the fact of heredity. Thechildren with whom 
we work are different by nature, and nothing that we can do 
will make them all alike. Then, too, there is the added factor 
of training before the school age. Many children come to 
school with bad habits and low ideals. The one thing that | 
every teacher ought to realize as fundamental in moral train-
-P-A-G-E-161
  Moral Tratning 147 
ing is the fact that differences in children must be met by a 
corresponding difference of appeal on the part of the teacher. 
Over against the differences due to heredity and previous 
training, there is to be found the common instinctive equip- 
ment. Children instinctively imitate, construct, collect, 
inquire, emulate, sympathize, contest, wonder, are proud, and 
the like. This instinctive equipment furnishes the basis for 
actions which in turn become habits. The problem of the 
teacher is to use these instincts in securing desirable responses. 
Of course, undesirable responses have their basis in instinct. 
Here it is the business of the teacher to make the undesirable 
response result in discomfort, or, better, to substitute a desir- 
able response. To be too proud of one’s attainment as con- 
trasted with others may be unlovely, but to be proud of work 
better done to-day than yesterday is a positive virtue resting 
upon the same instinctive foundation. The teacher may be 
worried because of the imitation of that which is socially un- 
desirable, but she may use this same tendency to react to pro- 
duce the social graces. There are cases in which the attempt 
to substitute may fail, and the necessity for inhibition by 
accompanying the undesirable response by unpleasant results 
arise. The important thing is not to neglect this instinctive 
equipment. The tendencies shown in childhood furnish the 
one basis for moral development, and their neglect may re- 
sult in lack of moral strength throughout the life of the 
individual. 
Besides the differences among individuals, there are differ- 
ences corresponding roughly to stages of development. The 
authority which is accepted without question by children of 
six will be seriously questioned by the adolescent. Children 
grow not only in their ability to judge of the right action, but 
also in their demand that authority be amenable to reason. 
There can be no doubt but that rational morality is the type 
which the school should attempt to develop. To this end it 
is essential that the responsibility of children for their own
-P-A-G-E-162
  148 A Brief Course in the Teaching Process 
actions and for the welfare of the whole group should increase 
as they pass through the school. There is a possibility of 
controlling little children through fear, but the time comes 
when threats no longer avail. It is a sorry spectacle to see 
a mature individual who must still be controlled by fear of 
the results which will follow misconduct. It may be ques- 
tioned whether the continued use of corporal punishment 
may not result in arrested development in morality. The 
desire for social approval develops throughout the school 
period. When children or adults fail to see the reasonable- 
ness of a demand, this appeal to approval of the group may be 
most effective in securing desirable responses. The rule which 
the teacher must follow is never to appeal to a lower motive 
when a higher may be used. Fear, respect for authority, 
faith in the wisdom of the one directing, desire for social 
approval, ability to pick out the essentially moral element in 
the situation, and desire to act in accordance with one’s best 
judgment, —thus runs the hierarchy of motives which control. 
In any group some children can be appealed to by one motive 
and some by another. The teacher who is developing moral 
strength in the group will constantly seek to appeal to the 
children on a plane just higher than that which they have 
hitherto occupied. 
Another factor which plays an important part in condition- 
ing the work of the school in developing morality is the 
generally accepted standards of the community. Social 
heredity furnishes the basis for belief in the continued develop- 
ment of society. The progress that has been made, the 
standards once established, become the common heritage of 
the members of the group. Drunkenness is no longer con- 
sidered gentlemanly ; we do not lie to our enemies when they 
have a right to know the truth; our ideal of civic righteous- 
ness demands that a man be as honest when he serves the whole 
people as he is when he deals with individuals. The impor- 
tance of this factor of environment in determining the moral 
 
-P-A-G-E-163

life of the individual is admitted even by those who emphasize 
most strongly the importance of original nature. For the 
school it gives hope because of the influences which may there 
be brought to bear upon the child; and it adds a problem, 
because the school may not'ignore the home or the street from 
which the child comes. It does not seem unreasonable to 
expect that teachers will at no far distant day become most 
active in all activities which make for better, cleaner, more 
worthy surroundings for the children whom they attempt to 
train during a relatively small part of their waking hours. 
The physical condition of children and teacher has much 
to do with the possibility of effective school work, and train- 
ing in morality is not an exception to the rule. There is not 
much use in trying to form moral habits, nor in asking children 
to form moral judgments, in a room filled with foul air, with 
the temperature above seventy-five. Poor physical condition 
on the part of the teacher is often responsible for lack of con- 
trol on the part of children. A nervous, worn-out teacher is 
apt to nag, is almost sure to magnify insignificant acts, and 
by virtue of her lack of control of herself is in no position to 
control or instruct children. It would seem at times that we 
need medical care for teachers even more than for children. 
One child in poor physical condition may be hard to manage, 
and may fail to gain much either intellectually or morally 
from the school; but one teacher in poor physical condition 
may do positive injury to a roomful of children. A few days 
with a dyspeptic teacher may mean the formation of bad habits 
which it will take weeks or even months to eradicate. 
We are beginning to realize that there is a direct relation 
between hygiene and morality. The underfed, overworked, 
physically unfit are so frequently immoral that we had almost 
charged their condition to their immorality. In doing so we 
were often confusing cause and effect. However the problem 
may be solved so far as adults are concerned, we are satisfied 
that children of school age are entitled to happy, healthful 
     
-P-A-G-E-164
  150 A Brief Course in the Teaching Process 
lives in so far as it is possible to achieve this result. The work 
done to secure better physical conditions, both in school and 
at home, is probably as significant for the morality of children 
as is amy instruction that is given; and such care for the 
physical welfare of children is the condition without which we 
have no right to expect them to grow morally strong. 
While all are agreed as to the necessity for moral training in 
our schools, there is a difference of opinion concerning the 
method to be used. One school advocates direct moral in- 
struction by means of fairy tales, history, and other stories, and 
by moral precepts. The advocates of this form of instruction 
believe that they can in this way make children understand 
clearly what is right, and because of the emotional reaction 
produced by tale or story the children will not only know the 
right, but will also want to do right. Those who believe in 
indirect instruction find in the regular work of the school, in 
the teaching of all subjects, as well as in the control of the chil- 
dren in school, the best opportunity for moral instruction. 
With regard to the direct method, it seems to the writer 
that it is assumed that ‘“‘to know right is to do right.” So far 
as the emotion aroused by a story of bravery, or honesty, or 
temperance is concerned, the chances are that it will have 
entirely evaporated before any occasion for action is found. 
And right here is one very great danger in this sort of instruc- 
tion. To have the emotions aroused without any outlet in 
the corresponding action may result in developing individuals 
who are entirely satisfied with the emotion. They learn to 
delight in emotions, and lack efficiency in action. The time 
to tell the story of braveryis when bravery is actally demanded ; 
or for the child who knows the story simply as a story and 
without any attempt to use it to teach morality, the story may 
be referred to when this virtue is demanded. Likewise with 
the moral precept. For one who has had some experience in 
acting in accordance with his best moral judgment, the precept 
may be used as a significant generalization. Honesty may be 
 
-P-A-G-E-165
  Moral Training 151 
the best policy after you have won in the struggle and have 
the approval of conscience, and of those whose judgment you 
value. You may be ashamed to be designated by the name 
of the unlovely character in the story, when you are really 
guilty of his weakness of character. It would seem safer, from 
what we know of the emotions, to assume that actions are 
responsible for emotions rather than to expect the emotion to 
produce the corresponding action. 
In support of the indirect method of teaching morality, it 
may be argued that the school presents continually a situation 
in which moral action is demanded.! It is possible, of course, 
to deny to children any considerable responsibility for their 
actions. Children who are hedged about by rules and regu- 
lations, who are constantly directed and commanded by the 
teacher, will grow little in power to form correct moral judg- 
ments. But the ideal school is in fact a society, and the de- 
mand for moral activity, and consequently the chance to grow 
in morality, is as great as in any other life situation. It must 
be remembered, too, that the main purpose of the moral train- 
ing which the school gives is to make moral growth continuous. 
New situations will demand new adjustments, and it is not 
possible to supply the child with a morality which will be suffi- 
cient for his future needs. The one preparation which will 
certainly be effective in making possible later growth is to be 
found in the moral action of to-day. 
The subjects of instruction lend themselves to moral train- 
ing. Moral strength depends upon interest in those activities 
which make for social welfare, in the exercise of judgment in 
determining the course of action which will contribute most 
to the general welfare, and in action in accordance with the 
judgment rendered. Our course of study contains much which 
should result in increased appreciation and sympathy in the 
activities which characterize our modern society. Geography, 
history, nature study, literature, all deal with men in their 
1 Dewey, Moral Principles in Education. 
 
-P-A-G-E-166
  152 A Brief Course in the Teaching Process 
relationship with one another in a common environment. If 
teaching means anything more than gaining knowledge, 
the method employed in school subjects cannot be without 
moral significance. Teachers who demand accuracy, who are 
more interested in the truth of history than in a moral tale, 
who are open-minded rather than dogmatic, who seek to exalt 
the intellect and to hold the emotions under control, are doing 
more effective moral teaching than those who preach by the 
hour. 
As has already been indicated,' the ordinary school work 
lends itself to the development of positive moral virtues. To 
work together, to contribute to the welfare of the whole group, 
to determine conduct in view of the possible effect on others, 
is to exercise those virtues which are demanded in all social 
situations. Pride and joy in one’s work and contempt for the 
shirker are as natural in school as in any other situation. The 
so-called school virtues of punctuality, regularity, obedience, 
and industry are virtues outside of schools by virtue of the same 
sanction which gives them validity in the school society. It 
is important to realize that many of these virtues must be 
reduced to the basis of habit in order to be most effective. 
Acts of kindness, courtesy, punctuality, repeated often enough, 
become second nature. They need no longer to be thought 
about. i 
In the field which requires judgment, it is also true that one’s 
attitude may become habitual. Much which we call morality 
can be accounted for by taste. Many boys and girls have 
been saved the struggle through which others pass by ideals 
and contempts which they have derived from their associates. 
Fortunate, indeed, is the boy or girl who can say : “The mem- 
bers of our set do not frequent saloons, do not lie or cheat, 
play fair, work hard, dare to do right.” Allofus tend to de- 
rive our moral code from the group of people with whom we 
are constantly associated. There is honor even among thieves, 
1 See chapter on Social Phases of the Recitation.
-P-A-G-E-167
  Moral Training 153 
because they have a code which they respect. The teacher 
who secures the codperation of the leaders of the group can 
modify, indeed transform, the moral attitude of a class by 
this appeal to the code which the whole group accepts and upon 
which the leaders insist. 
The highest type of moral action is that which involves 
judgments of worth. When one asks himself the question, is 
this right, will it be for the general welfare, and then acts in 
accordance with that judgment, he has performed an essen- 
tially moral act. Training for this sort of action is of the same 
sort that is demanded wherever the judgment is involved. The 
child must be taught to analyze the situation and to pick out 
the essentially moral element. The writer once knew a high 
school class who habitually cheated in examinations. They 
said that they were getting ahead of the teacher. The princi- 
pal explained that they were dishonest, that cheating was steal- 
ing. The attitude of the class changed. They responded to 
this analysis of the situation which pointed out the moral ele- 
ment. What we call thoughtlessness and the sowing of wild 
oats is often to be explained by the lack of analysis which makes 
prominent the moral significance of the contemplated action. 
The school should give opportunity whenever possible, whether 
in ordinary schoolroom work, on the playground, or with refer- 
ence to extra-school activities, for the exercise of the moral 
judgment. Power to analyze new situations and to act morally 
depends entirely upon previous judgments and actions. 
Any discussion of moral training would be incomplete which 
did not take account of the reformation of the wrong doer 
through school punishments or discipline. “Discipline and 
punishment are teaching processes as much as are grammar or 
arithmetic lessons, and when we remember that conduct and 
behavior is the whole of life, we must welcome the occasions for 
discipline, and even for punishment. No sane person is glad 
that a child’s instincts, impulses, and habits have taken wrong 
forms, but the real teacher is glad that these forms manifest 
    
 
-P-A-G-E-168
    154 A Brief Course in the Teaching Process 
themselves, so that they may be worked over into correct reac- 
tions.” 1 The key to the situation is found in placing the re- 
sponsibility with the child. If a wrong has been committed, 
either he has failed to think of the moral significance of his act, 
or he has chosen to do wrong. In the one case reformation may 
be brought about by making clear the nature of the act ; in the 
other the child must will to do differently, and must by his 
own act regain his place in the group whose welfare he has 
transgressed. What the ordinary situation demands is more 
of thinking on the part of children and less of resentment and 
anger on the part of teachers. 
Punishments need to be differentiated to fit the child. The 
writer has known boys in active rebellion against school author- 
ity who would accept corporal punishment rather than give 
any evidence of intention to submit. In such a case this form 
of punishment was justified. Happily such casesare rare with 
the teacher who knows how to work with children. Even in 
cases where the offense is seemingly identical, the punishment 
must be varied to suit the individual to be reformed. Sugges- 
tion may suffice for. one, another may be persuaded, and still 
another must be labored with at length in order that the judg- 
ment which the teacher has passed may be accepted by him as 
valid. In anyevent it isthe thoughtful individual, who has the 
habit of analyzing the situation when in doubt, and then acts 
in accordance with his judgment, which it is the purpose of the 
school to develop. 
The importance of the moral influence of the teacher has 
always been recognized. At times, however, the negative 
rather than the positive factors have been emphasized. It is 
well enough to demand that the teacher be free from vices, 
petty or great; but it is even more important to inquire con- 
cerning the positive virtues which characterize the instructor 
of children. We may hope that our schools will develop open-

minded children, provided the teachers are not dogmatic. 
Courage, industry, integrity, are fundamental virtues. Does 
the teacher possess them? Sympathy with all activities which 
make for public good is demanded of allin a democracy. Does 
the teacher participate, is the teacher a factor, in those move- 
ments which make for improvement in the community? The 
ideal teacher is an intelligent, hard-working public servant, 
whose field of endeavor is limited only by the needs of the com- 
munity which he serves. The number of teachers who have 
thus exalted the office of teacher in the community is happily 
increasing. The moral effect upon the lives of children of 
association with such a man or woman cannot be overestimated.

      CHAPTER XV 
CLASS MANAGEMENT 
In any discussion of class management it is necessary to 
distinguish clearly between organization and control as a means 
and as an end. Much of the discussion of school and class 
management assumes that its sole purpose is found in economiz- 
ing time and energy for teacher and pupils. Class manage- 
ment, from this point of view, is important as the means with- 
out which effective work cannot be done in the school. Such a 
view neglects to consider the opportunity afforded in managing 
a class for growth on the part of pupils in the power of self- 
control. Any school which plans to reproduce in its life the 
conditions commonly found in life outside of the school must 
allow children to accept responsibility for their own acts, and 
will, therefore, look upon management as an end. 
The discussion has not been wholly one-sided. At times 
there has been considerable controversy concerning the kind of - 
management which was most to be desired in the schoolroom. 
Those who have thought of management as a means only have 
been apt to overemphasize routine; while those who have 
thought only of the opportunity afforded for growth in self- 
control have neglected to realize the importance of habit in 
situations which are invariable. The adherents of the one 
type of control want everything done at the tap of the bell, in 
accordance with the rules which have been made by the teacher. 
Their opponents would do away with “mechanized routine,” 
and would expect children to exercise their judgment as each 
question arises. This difference in point of view is easily 
157
-P-A-G-E-172
  158 A Brief Course in the Teaching Process 
reconciled when we look at management now as a means and 
again as an end. 
If a fire drill is to be effective, every one must drop the work 
in hand when the signal is given and march out of the building 
in an order and by a route which has been determined previ- 
ously and from which there is no variation. Here we have 
the best example of management as a means. There can be 
no question in this situation concerning the right of the indi- 
vidual to exercise his judgment. The safety of all depends 
upon the absolute following of rules, upon the degree to which 
the response to the fire drill has become a matter of habit. 
If we analyze this situation, we will discover the elements 
which characterize situations in which we are to look upon 
management as a means. In these situations we should strive 
to secure habitual responses. 
In the first place the response demanded is invariable. It 
will not do to march out of the building one way to-day and 
another to-morrow. The class may not go before or after its 
placein theline. The speed with which the building is emptied 
depends upon every individual. Here we have the second 
element: the welfare of the whole group demands that the 
situation be followed always by a certain response. 
Let us examine now some of the schoolroom situations in the 
light of these criteria. In passing books, paper, pencils, and 
the like, a definite order should be followed. In this situation 
the end desired is invariable. What is wanted is to place the 
desired material in the hands of each pupil with as little delay 
as is possible. The welfare of the whole group depends upon 
this invariable response upon the part of each pupil. If any 
one fails to do his part, there is delay and loss of time in the 
work which it is desired to accomplish. For the same reasons 
it is wise to have a definite order in getting wraps, a rule con- 
cerning the manner of passing in the room, the habit of rising 
and facing the majority of the class when reciting, and the 
like.
-P-A-G-E-173
  Class Management 159 
Let us now examine other situations which afford an oppor- 
tunity for the exercise of self-control, in which management is 
an end. In some schools children are formed in lines five min- 
utes before the hour and marched into the building. There is 
no good reason why children should march into the building. 
The end desired, that they all be in their places promptly, 
can be secured by ringing a warning bell and requiring that 
all enter the building as they see fit and be in their places on 
time. In the latter instance they have a chance to act as nor- 
mal human beings who accept and fulfill their responsibility to 
themselves and tothe group. The desired end is secured, and, 
far more important, the children are learning to exercise that 
self-control which is demanded outside of school. Of course, 
it may be objected that it is much easier to control the children, 
if you march them into the building. The answer is found by 
suggesting that the school does not exist primarily for the ease 
of teachers, but rather for the development of socially efficient 
children. 
A principal who had some difficulty in having the boys come 
from a somewhat distant playground promptly lined them up 
for a race to the schoolhouse. They found that it took them 
little more than a minute to reach their schoolrooms. The 
boys understood his suggestion that the warning bell, rung five 
minutes before school opened, afforded ample time to reach 
their rooms and be ready for work when school opened. It 
would have required less thought on the part of the principal 
and less self-control on the part of the boys to have marched 
them to the schoolhouse at the right time each day. Many 
school situations offer similar opportunity. Passing through 
halls, asking the teacher questions, leaving one’s seat for books 
or materials, consulting with one’s neighbor may, in the hands 
of a skillful teacher, become a most efficient means of training 
children in self-control. In all such cases management is an 
end, in the sense that these opportunities are sought by the 
teacher because of their value in training children. 
 
-P-A-G-E-174
  160 A Brief Course in the Teaching Process 
Pupil participation in school government has been much ad- 
vocated of late as the best means of securing a feeling of re- 
sponsibility on the part of pupils for the welfare of the whole 
group, as well as in the exercise of self-control. As long as these 
ideals control, it matters little what particular form of organi- 
zation is utilized to secure the ends desired. What sometimes 
happens is an exaggeration of the importance of the machinery 
of government, with a corresponding lack of self-control, or 
exercise of social responsibility. The writer once visited a 
school which was much talked of because of its system of 
“pupil self-government.”’ He found there the worst bullying 
of small boys by those who held offices that he has ever seen 
in any school. Many of the children declared that they were 
not parties to the government supposedly in control of the 
school. When the teachers were absent from their rooms, the 
children droned over certain set exercises which were constantly 
before them and from which type of activity they were not per- 
mitted to depart. Now these defects in school management 
may not all be charged directly to the overemiphasis of the 
machinery of government, but they were due to the fact that 
this machinery, this form, had taken the place of genuine self- 
government on the part of the pupils. 
A wise principal or teacher may secure good results by in- 
augurating a system of pupil participation in school govern- 
ment, but the wise guide and counsellor must be there all of 
the time. Introducing children dramatically to the machinery 
of government will not place old heads on young shoulders. 
Children will still be childish in their judgments and in their 
ideas of punishment, even though they be called senators, 
aldermen, policemen, judges, and the like. The dramatization 
of city or state government will undoubtedly help in the un- 
derstanding of the function of citizens and of their servants, the 
officeholders. This alone would be sufficient justification for 
introducing in the upper grades, in dramatic form, a system of 
government, without expecting that it would in any consider-
-P-A-G-E-175
  Class Management 161 
able measure relieve teachers or principals of the necessity of 
guiding children in their development in power of self-control, 
and in their acceptance of social responsibility. 
The same system of pupil participation in school govern- 
ment will succeed with one principal and set of teachers and 
fail in another situation. The results which are most worth 
while, self-control and the exercise of social responsibility, will 
be secured without any of the forms of civil government in one 
school, while another principal will claim that success in his 
school is due to his system of “pupil government.”’ No teacher 
need feel condemned because she cannot succeed with a par- 
ticular scheme of government, and none should be unduly 
elated because of the invention or use of some particular form 
of organization. The essential element in school management 
is found in the spirit of codperation and helpfulness which 
should actuate teachers and pupils. 
The questions of management considered above cover much 
of the ground usually considered under the head of school dis- 
cipline. The same problems, especially from the standpoint of 
punishments and rewards, are considered in the chapter which 
deals with the moral training of children. It may be well to 
add here that the problem of discipline is largely one of good 
teaching. Children who are hard at work seldom worry the 
teacher. Right conditions for work may play an important 
part. The consideration of some of the problems of organiza- 
tion is, therefore, in place in a chapter on management. 
The ordering of the daily program is one of the most 
important elements in classroom management. The desire 
for variety is strong in children, and their power to concentrate 
their attention upon a single kind of work is correspondingly 
short. In the primary grades periods of from eight to twelve 
minutes, with a possible extension to fifteen, will give sufficient 
opportunity for change of work. These periods may be length- 
ened to thirty or even forty minutes in the upper grades. The 
length of the period will depend upon the variety which may be 
M
-P-A-G-E-176
  162 A Brief Course in the Ti caching Process 
found in the work of a single period. Ina reading lesson which 
includes word drill, reading, and oral composition, the maximum 
period may be used, while a period devoted to number drill 
may be worse than useless after the first five or six minutes. 
It is undoubtedly better for children to work to the maximum 
of their capacity for short periods than to dawdle for twice the 
time. In the upper grades twenty minutes may be as long 
as children can work on the development of a difficult problem 
in geography, while they may be active and willing to continue 
work in a literature lesson after thirty-five or forty minutes. 
The writer has seen a class of seventh-grade children who 
worked consistently for forty-five minutes on a history prob- 
lem which involved discussion, map work, and the consulting 
of reference works. — 
Group instruction has long been recognized by teachers of 
large classes as essential to the best work. In a class of forty 
or fifty children, however carefully they may have been graded 
at the beginning of the year, there will appear differences in 
attainment which make it necessary to divide the class into 
two or more groups in some subjects, in order to work to best 
advantage. In the lower grades, especially in the first, where 
grading is least able to place children on the basis of their 
ability, there is the greatest demand for group work. As 
many as three or four classes in reading may. be necessary in the 
first grade. It must be remembered that such grouping should 
never be made to apply to all subjects, nor is it necessary to 
apply the group plan to any subject without variation. Chil- 
dren divided into three groups for reading may do very well 
in two for arithmetic, and may all work together in nature 
study or constructive work. In reading it will be worth while 
to have all work together at times on work which is possible 
for the least capable and which may serve as a review for the 
more advanced group. 
By the time the fourth or fifth grade is reached, the pupils 
will be somewhat more evenly graded. It will still benecessary,
-P-A-G-E-177
  Class Management 163 
however, to group pupils in those subjects in which the se- 
quence is such that the pupils’ advance depends upon the com- 
plete mastery of the part of the subject already covered. In 
arithmetic, in the more formal part of the work in English 
composition, and sometimes in geography or history, two 
groups are advantageous. 
When pupils all work together it is not expected that all 
will be able to do an equal amount of work. It is especially 
important that provision be made for the brighter members 
of the class, in order that they may have enough work to keep 
them active and alert. It too often happens that in large 
classes the work is scaled down to meet the ability of the 
poorest half of the class, in consequence of which the brighter 
pupils learn to loaf and tend to lose interest in school work. 
However many groups the class may be divided into, there 
will always be the necessity for individualizing the children of 
each section. The brighter ones must be given assignments 
which are beyond the ability of the less capable, while a mini- 
mum of achievement must be accepted when it represents the 
best effort and means the continued development of the pupil 
who is weaker intellectually. 
Good teachers provide for individual needs, not only by 
grouping their classes on the basis of their ability, but also 
by giving individual instruction. No daily program should 
fail to provide a period during which the teacher can devote 
herself to the needs of those individuals who need special 
help. It may be to help the boy or girl who has been absent 
on account of sickness, to explain a difficult problem in arith- 
metic, to help in the interpretation of a map or diagram, or 
to teach the pupil how to study; always there will be plenty 
for the teacher to do who thinks of her pupils as individuals 
during the half hour or more devoted to individual instruc- 
tion. 
The idea of providing individual instruction may be made 
the central idea in organizing the daily program, as is done in 
   
-P-A-G-E-178
  164 A Brief Course in the Teaching Process 
the Batavia system,! which allows one half of all school time 
for individual instruction. There would seem to be little need 
for devoting so much time to individual instruction in a school 
having any adequate system of grading and promotion. 
Indeed, as has already been pointed out in the discussion of 
social phases of the recitation, there is a positive advantage 
in teaching in groups. The extravagant claims sometimes 
made for particular systems of organization, especially when 
it is declared possible by means of the system for all children 
to reach the same standard of excellence, bear on their face 
the evidence of their fallacy. 
Any attempt to give group or individual instruction must be 
accompanied by provision for seat work for those who are not 
working with the teacher. In the lower grades much has been 
accomplished by allowing children to express themselves with 
colored crayons and paints, with scissors and paste, as well as 
with the more common pencil and paper for copying, or the 
letters and words for word and sentence building. There is 
probably as much worth in the seat work which results in the 
expression of the ideas gained from a story bymeans of crayons 
or with scissors as there is in the conversation concerning the 
story in class. As children advance, more difficult problems 
in constructive work and in study may be assigned. 
In the intermediate and upper grades the problem of having 
children occupied who are not directly under the supervision 
of the teacher is largely the problem of teaching these children 
to study. A child in the fourth grade ought to be able to 
discover and note carefully the difficulties which the lesson 
assigned presents, and he should, in some measure at least, be 
able to satisfy the problems which arise. In succeeding grades, 
if children are being taught to study, they ought in increasing 
measure to be able to gather data, organize it, and proceed to 
the solution of their own problems.”

  Class Management 165 
The conduct of the recitation has been discussed at length 
in preceding chapters. It may be well to emphasize here the 
more essential criteria. In a well managed recitation all of 
the children are responsible for the progress of the class all 
of the time. To this end the teacher addresses her questions 
to the whole class before calling on any individual. The pupils 
are held responsible for the answers which are given. The 
teacher does not constantly repeat and explain answers. 
When they do not understand, children are expected to ask 
each other questions. To secure these ends the class should, 
when possible, be seated so that the one reciting may easily 
face the other members of the class. The ideal seating is 
found in the kindergarten circle. In a room with sufficient 
space in front, the children may be seated or may stand in such 
a way as to gain most of the advantages of the circle. If 
pupils must sit in rows of seats with their backs to each other, 
it may help to have the children reciting face the majority, 
and to encourage those whose backs are toward the speaker to 
turn in their seats. It would seem possible that we may some- 
time furnish our schoolrooms with reference to our ideals of 
education; that a classroom may sometime become a place 
fitted for a group of children who are to work together in the 
solution of their problems. 
The lack of proper management of a class may hinder the 
work of a teacher whose work is excellent in other respects ; 
but no skill in management, however efficient in keeping chil- 
dren in order, can take the place of good teaching. Most men 
and women who know how to teach learn to manage a room 
full of children. There are still a few who call themselves 
teachers who exalt management unduly. For them the es- 
sential elements in school teaching are discipline, control, 
organization. To the young teacher, or to the one who would 
grow, the ideal of better teaching must constantly lead 
toward greater efficiency. Observe any successful teacher, 
and you can discover the devices of management which allow

her to work to best advantage, and the use which she makes 
of the opportunities which the school presents to develop 
self-control and social responsibility on the part of her pupils.

CHAPTER XVI 
LESSON PLANS 
Tue best teachers never reach the point where preparation 
for the day’s work is unnecessary. The teacher who stimu- 
lates her pupils to their best effort must herself be interested 
in the work in hand. If nothing new in material or method 
is found to vary the work, interest soon lags. The lesson 
often repeated is as dry and lacking in power to interest or 
inspire as the proverbial sermon taken from the barrel. Even 
when a teacher has taught a most successful lesson, it is dan- 
gerous to try to repeat that exercise in precisely the same 
way. The two situations will not be alike. The fact that she 
tries to repeat will take the edge off the lesson for the teacher, 
and make it correspondingly dull for the pupils. Young and 
inexperienced teachers are often most successful because of the 
zest with which they attack the problems which are new to 
them. The older teacher may be able to keep a class in order 
and teach them something with a minimum of preparation; 
but her best work will be done only when she has planned as 
carefully as the novice for whom the need of preparation is so 
apparent. 
The subject matter which should be drawn upon for any 
lesson constantly changes. No two groups of children have 
had exactly the same varieties of experience ; hence the need 
for varying the approach, as well as the demand for differences 
in observations, experiments, reading, or other methods em- 
ployed to bring the data necessary for the solution of their 
problem before children. Subject matter is growing, is being 
made all of the time. Last year’s discussion of the geography 
167 
 
-P-A-G-E-182
  168 A Brief Course in the Teaching Process 
of Europe, of South America, of Africa, or of Asia will not 
suffice for this year, because interesting and important events 
have occurred in these countries during the year intervening. 
For the wide-awake teacher, even that most exact of thesciences, 
mathematics, represented by arithmetic in our curriculum, 
will change; since the number aspect of children’s experience 
will vary. If spelling means the study of words which are 
needed for use in written expression, the work in spelling will 
vary just as surely as the occasions for written expression 
vary among children. No teacher could, if she would, repeat 
a series of lessons which deal with natural phenomena. In any 
field, the need for preparation becomes apparent for one who 
would command the material which should be made available 
for children. 
In the preparation of a lesson plan the first and in some re- 
spects the most important step is to become acquainted with 
the subject to be taught. There is no method of teaching 
which can take the place of a thoroughgoing knowledge of the 
material which bears upon the topic to be treated. The 
teacher who finds in the life of the children outside of school, 
in school activities, in books, pictures, magazines, in study and 
travel, material for her daily class work, will make any course 
of study vital and interesting to children. In such an at- 
mosphere pupils will grow not only in knowledge, but also in 
the desire to inquire and investigate and in power to satisfy 
their intellectual craving. 
After the teacher has in hand an abundance of interesting 
material, the next step in the plan is to organize the data to be 
presented. Some organization is usually found in textbooks 
and courses of study, and it is possible simply to try to fit 
any additional material which may have been collected to the 
scheme provided. The difficulty with this ready-made or- 
ganization is found in the fact that it has little or no relation 
to the needs or problems of the particular group of children to 
be taught. Any organization which is to be significant to 
 
-P-A-G-E-183
Lesson Plans 169 
children must take account of their point of view, and attempt 
to present subject matter in response to the need which they 
feel for the material to be presented. This is precisely what 
is meant by the difference between the logical and psycho- 
logical methods of presenting subject matter. Not that the 
psychological method is illogical, rather it takes account of the 
child’s needs and is for him logical beyond the most complete 
adult logical scheme. It may seem logical to the adult to 
teach the crayfish by calling attention to the large parts and 
then to thesmaller parts in order, or to deal with the structure 
of the skeleton, nervous and circulatory systems, connective 
tissues, and the like. To an eight-year-old child, the problems 
which will probably be most logical, most satisfying to his 
desire for investigation, will deal with the way in which the 
crayfish gets his living, how he protects himself from his ene- 
mies, how he brings disaster by making holes in levees, and 
how important he is as an article of food. In satisfying these 
childish problems, much of the information which might have 
been imparted, had the adult scientific order been followed, 
will be mastered by the pupils. Much more will be remem- 
bered, because the information is associated with the solution 
of interesting problems. It may seem logical in teaching 
India to a sixth-grade class to treat of prevailing winds, surface 
features, climate, vegetation, animals, mineral products, and 
people; but the children whose teacher approached this sub- 
ject by asking them to try to discover why they have had 
such terrible famines in India probably remember more of the 
geography of India to-day than those who followed the adult 
logical order. In organization, then, the starting point is to 
get the child’s point of view, to discover his problems, and to 
organize the material to be presented with reference to these 
childish aims. 
Good organization demands that material presented to 
satisfy the demand made by the child’s problem be grouped 
yround few coérdinate heads.! Many topics of equal value 
1 McMurry, How to Study, Chapter III. 
   
-P-A-G-E-184
oD 170 A Brief Course in the Teaching Process 
in an outline generally indicate a lack of organization, a lack 
of appreciation of the relation of the various facts to be pre- 
sented. For example, one might think of a great many facts 
about plant growth; the seeds must be put in the earth, the 
weather must be warm enough, they must have water, they 
need to be hoed, the ground should be fertile, they need air, 
they grow best when they havesunlight, they may have toomuch 
moisture, in rocky ground the soil may not be deep enough, 
they must not be too close together, weeds and insects must be 
destroyed, the roots should not be disturbed, the.choice of 
the seed is important, and so on. For a g ‘oup of lower- 
grade children there are two problems; namely, (x) what 
kind of plants do we want, and (2) what can we do to 
make them grow well. Under the first head would come the 
plants which are suitable for our conditions of soil and climate, 
and the question of seed selection. Under the second head 
the topics will be moisture, sunlight, air, and cultivation, in- 
cluding the destroying of insects or other pests. Each of these 
topics will be suggested in answer to the problems which have 
been raised (what plants we want, and how we can make them 
grow well) by a group of children who have had any experience 
with growing plants. If any important topic is omitted, the 
teacher will call for it by a question which suggests the lack of 
a complete solution to the problem which is being considered. 
This brings us to the next step in plan making. 
A good lesson plan will include pivotal questions which will 
serve to call for the data as indicated by the main topics given 
in the organization of the subject matter. The problem of 
questioning has been discussed at some length in a previous 
chapter! In planning a lesson, a question or two which will 
discover to the children the problem to be solved should come 
first in the plan. With the problem before the children, the 
function of the question is to stimulate thought in the direction 
of the solution of the problem. The writer is familiar with the 
1 See ante, Chapter XI. 
   
-P-A-G-E-185
  Lesson Plans i 4 171 
objection that questions cannot be prepared ahead of time. 
It is true that the form of question may need to be varied 
because of progress or the lack of it, not anticipated by the 
teacher, but the question carefully prepared ahead of time will 
help rather than hinder in the formulation of a question to meet 
the situation. It is true, too, that not all of the questions can 
be prepared ahead of time. Alli the more reason for careful 
preparation of a few questions which will enable the teacher 
to prevent wandering by children during the development of 
the topic. Thought-provoking questions which guide and 
stimulate children in the solution of their problems are de- 
pendent upon the aim which has been established and upon 
the organization of material which it is desired to follow in the 
solution of the problem. One might as well deny the need 
of organizing material, as to question the value of preparing 
a few pivotal questions as a part of the plan. 
Lessons often fail because the ground covered during the 
period cannot be retraced by the children at the end of the 
exercise. In a well-organized plan the teacher will provide for 
summaries as each main point is covered. In general these 
summaries should aim to recall the subject matter covered from 
the beginning of the lesson. It may be suggested that any 
good teacher summarizes her work as she passes from point to 
pointin her teaching, and that no artificial reminder is necessary. 
The difficulty is that a good summary is not accomplished 
merely by asking for a recapitulation of the material covered. 
The skillful teacher puts her question which involves a sum- 
mary in such form that the pupils get a new view of the ground 
already covered. In the experience of the writer, questions 
which involve a summary of the work covered, with the added 
element of a new view as a stimulus to further thought on the 
subject, are more raie than good questions introducing new 
topics. 
A good plan will include a list of illustrations, illustrative 
material, books including references to chapter or page, maps 
 
-P-A-G-E-186
172 A Brief Course in the Teaching Process 
or charts which are to be consulted during the recitation. 
Teacher and children are often disappointed because of the 
lack of materials which could have been at hand had the teacher 
only thought about the lesson before teaching it. In like 
manner, the opportunities for motor expression, other than 
reciting or discussing, should be noted in the plan. Dramati- 
zation, constructive work, graphic representation at the seat 
or on the blackboard, may make the difference between success 
and failure in a recitation. 
A lesson which has been well planned will naturally end in 
the assignment of work to be done in preparation for the next 
recitation. In the discussion of any problem there must arise 
questions which cannot then be answered. A good lesson is 
characterized not simply by the ability of children to report 
progress, but quite as much by their statement of the questions 
still unanswered. The direction sometimes given to call up 
again the question which is left unanswered during the recita- 
tion indicates a teacher whose assignments provide a real 
stimulus for study in preparation for the next day’s work. If 
it is necessary to have a live problem before children during 
the recitation conducted by the teacher, obviously it is much 
more necessary to make assignments which involve real issues 
for children to meet. 
In outline form the discussion of plan making given above 
would appear as given below. This lesson on plan making 
may be taken as an illustration of the type of plan a teacher 
should prepare for a development lesson. In this plan, as in 
others, it seems wise to keep the subject matter separate from 
the method of procedure.

1. Value of forests to systems of 
irrigation. 
2. Our relations to the irrigated 
regions. 
3. Advisability of introducing 
irrigation in the Eastern states. 
4. Irrigation in Egypt. 
5. Irrigation in India. 
Individual assignments : — 
1. Economy of water in irriga- 
tion. 
2. Fruit growing on irrigated 
land.

4. Relative value to a state of 
gold mining and of farming. 
5. Relation of irrigation in the 
West to the people of Europe. 
6. To the people of the Eastern 
states. 
The plan given above for the topic “ irrigation”’ is typical of 
many plans which the teacher should make. It indicates the 
development of the whole topic, which will need the time of 
several recitations for its complete development. The topics 
given at the end of the plan for class study and for individual 
assignment show that the teacher had thought over the prob- 
lems which might arise as the subject was taught, and that 
she was ready to make such assignments as the situation de- 
manded from day to day. If such a list of possible assign- 
ments has been prepared before the topic is taught, the chances 
are that the ground will be much more thoroughly covered 
than would be the case if the teacher trusted to her ability to 
select an interesting problem at the end of each day’s work. 
Lesson plans should, as a rule, cover a complete unit of work 
or topic. One plan will commonly include inductive develop- 
ment work in the derivation of principles, drill work to fix 
these generalizations or to give skill in their application, and 
at times deductive work in the use of the principles derived 
to explain new situations. A complete plan for teaching per- 
centage in arithmetic would include all of the elements men- 
tioned. A lesson for appreciation or a recitation lesson may 
often be followed by drill work. When the topic lesson plan 
has been prepared, the teacher will need to consider from day 
to day the best method of proceeding with the subject. She 
may wish to vary somewhat the approach or order of develop- 
ment.

  180 A Brief Course in the Teaching Process 
A PLAN FOR A DRILL LESSON 
The work indicated here can be done in one period. The 
plan is given as an illustration of the principles involved in good 
drill work. It is especially necessary, in planning for lessons 
of this type, to be ready to vary the exercises in order to 
maintain the interest and attention of the class. Repetition 
with attention is what counts for habit formation. The chil- 
dren have been playing a game in which the score secured by 
throwing a bean bag in squares, numbered from one to ten, 
has been multiplied by two and later by three. The class has 
been divided into sides, and the competition has been keen. 
They want to make larger scores, and, therefore, have a com- 
pelling motive for studying the next table. 
Teacher’s aim: To teach multiplication by four. If we are 
to make larger scores, what table must we learn next? How 
many think they can learn half of the table of fours to-day ? 
If you learn it, we will play our game for ten minutes. 
Pupil’s aim: To learn the multiplication table of fours. 
Supyecr MATTER Meruop

4X2= 8 blackboard, as indicated under

Now let us take the first three. 
Proceed as before. 
T'll erase the first three. Look 
at them carefully. Now write 
them on your tablets.

Let four or five children read 
their answers. 
Margaret may ask for answers. 
She drills on the first three com- 
binations. 
The other two are easy to re- 
member, — four times three we 
know; it is the same as three times 
four, and four times five are twenty 
we can all remember. Look care- 
fully ; I am going to erase them. 
Drill by teacher on last two 
combinations. 
All combinations put on board 
again and read and written by 
\ children. 
Robert tries to discover whether 
there is any girl who has forgotten 
any part of the table. 
Katharine tries to catch the 
boys. 
All write at the dictation of the 
teacher, supplying the products. 
The game is then played. When 
any one makes a mistake in record- 
ing his score on the blackboard, 
his side is penalized the amount of 
his mistake. 
Possibly all the plans the experienced teacher needs for the 
lesson outlined above are a few notes concerning the variations 
to be introduced from time to time in the drill. She must plan, 
however, to put zest into the lesson by means of the variety 
which she introduces, and she must, if she is to get ths best 
work, provide some motive which will make the drill work 
seem worth while to the children. .

  182 A Brief Course in the Teaching Process 
A LESSON ESSENTIALLY DEDUCTIVE 
A part of a larger topic plan on taxation. The children 
have begun the study of taxation by inquiring how police- 
men, street cleaners, firemen, and other city employees are 
paid; how money is secured to run the schools, to provide 
water, and the like. 
Teacher's aim: To teach how to determine the amount of 
taxes to be paid when the assessed value of the property and 
the rate of taxation are known. 
George, did you find out the assessed valuation of your 
father’s house and lot? 
Henry, did you find the rate on real estate? 
Pupil’s aim: Let us try to find out how much tax George’s 
father must pay on his house and lot. 
Supject MATTER 
A knowledge of percentage is 
assumed. 
To find the percentage we mul- 
tiply the base by the rate. 
House is worth $3500. Rate of 
taxation is $1.80 on the hundred 
dollars. 
$2.80 on one hundred dollars 
35 times $1.80 would be the 
900 amount due on thirty-five 
540 hundred. 
$63.00 
Taxation is simply an applica- 
tion of percentage.   MetHoD OF PROCEDURE 
If you want to find six per cent 
of $3500, how do you proceed ? 
If George’s father pays $1.80 on 
each hundred dollars, how can you 
tell how much he must pay on 
thirty-five hundred dollars ? 
Do you discover in this example 
anything like the problems in 
which you find a certain per cent 
of a given sum? 
Find .o18 (115 per cent) of 
$3500. If you multiply the as- 
sessed. value by the rate, will you 
get the amount of the tax? 
Why must you point off two 
places ? 
Do you think you can find the 
amount of the tax to be paid on 
any house and lot in the city, if I 
tell you how much the assessed 
value of the house is?

PLAN FOR A SERIES OF TOPICS IN HISTORY — SIXTH GRADE 
A plan covering the work for several weeks given in the form 
of a topical outline with suggestions as to methods of treatment. 
This general plan would need to be supplemented by definite 
additional preparation from day to day. This plan was pre- 
pared by Miss Lida Lee Tall, supervisor of grammar grades, 
Baltimore County, Maryland. 
Aim: To teach the colonization of Maryland and show its 
development as a part of England’s colonial empire in the New 
World. 
Topical Outline (for the Teacher) 
I. Conditions in Europe at the time of the settlement of 
Maryland. 
II. Conditions in the New World.

As you read find out why 
this was so. 
Half the class may be given the 
first assignment, the other half the 
second. 
When, at the close of the study 
period, the teacher calls for the 
work, it will be through her se- 
quence of questions that the sub- 
ject matter will be organized ac- 
cording to the outline under 
“Subject Matter.” If the discus- 
sions are lively and argumentative, 
the spirit of the seventeenth cen- 
tury will be felt and the life of the 
time pictured. Pictures of castles, 
London streets, Ireland, the con- 
tinent, sea vessels, etc., will help 
to make impressions more vivid. 
Topic 6 makes a good summary 
and can be conducted in a way to 
make the work most attractive to 
the pupils.

As the teacher develops the 
lesson from the class, by means of 
thought-provoking questions, she 
can make an outline on the board, 
the class helping; then this outline 
may be copied by the pupils in 
notebooks used for history lessons 
only. These outlines should serve 
as summaries and also as reviews 
as the lessons continue.

2. The voyage. 
a. The stop at the Barbadoes. 
(It is necessary that 
the class understand 
something of Eng- 
land’s colonial terri- 
tory at the time: 
England colonized 
Barbadoes in 1625, 
after it had been 
depopulated by the 
Spanish. The island 
had, therefore, been 
under English con- 
trol for eight years. 
It was possible that 
  If the previous situations have 
been vividly presented, then the 
problem of the difficulties of get- 
ting such a trip under way that 
confronted Cecilius Calvert should 
be eagerly discussed by the class. 
‘There can be map work — Eng- 
land: locate Gravesend, Isle of 
Wight; also make the flag of Eng- 
land under which the expedition 
sailed. (The flag of 1608 was the 
united flag of England and Scot- 
land, the flag of St. George and St. 
Andrew combined. Lord Balti- 
more’s own banner can be made 
and colored, though it was not 
known to have been used until the 
battle of Severn; it was adopted 
as the state flag in 1904.) 
2. The voyage can be treated as 
a recall of the knowl- 
edge gained from the 
celebration of a holiday 
like Maryland Day in 
a previous grade, or an 
outline map may be 
drawn and pupils may 
trace the route if they 
can. 
(More map work can follow to 
indicate the stop at the Barbadoes, 
the route up the Atlantic to Old 
Point Comfort, another stop, and 
on to Blackiston Island.)

Barbadoes planned ?

for the Barbadoes. 
The colonists 
stopped for three 
weeks, in that time 
repairing the ves- 
sels, securing negro 
slaves, and buying 
supplies, among 
which was seed corn 
for the Maryland 
settlement.) 
6. The stop at Point Com- 
fort. — Letters from 
Cecilius Calvert and 
the king were to be 
delivered with great 
respect, by the hands 
of a messenger who 
was comformable to 
the Church of Eng- 
land, to Sir John 
Harvie, the governor 
of the Virginias.

arrangement with 
native Indians. 
5. Thesettlement on St. George’s 
Creek, afterward 
known as St. Mary’s

method followed should 
be: developing ques- 
tions, with the use of a 
textbook which should 
be read either before the 
lesson or after the de- 
velopment in order to 
verify conclusions made ; 
but this must be left to 
the judgment of the 
teachér and her own 
individual plan for deal- 
ing with the subject. 
Assigned reading : Gam- 
brill, pp. 17-19. 
7. For the life in the colonies, 
reading periods may be 
occupied with readings 
from any good book that 
gives a graphic account 
of the times, such as 
Alice Morse  Earle’s 
Home Life in the Colo- 
nies. If the sand table 
is used, the children 
should consult these 
books. Another way to 
vary the procedure, if 
there are books enough, 
is to assign readings and 
let the pupils bring to 
the class accounts of the 
details of the life in the 
colonies that seemed 
most interesting to them 
individually. 
In the Affairs of Interest it 
will be necessary for the 
teacher to tell about the 
conditions in England.

the information neces- 
sary for this purpose, 
but Cheyney’s European 
Background of American 
History should _ be 
studied by the teacher. 
The European _ back- 
ground can be very 
simply drawn. 
The Kent Island affair may 
be read before being dis- 
cussed, but there is good 
problem work there, and 
the better plan would be 
to read the text last.

Nore. — Here the development of the Maryland colony may be 
closed because of the political difficulties which are entirely beyond the 
experience of the sixth-year child. The French and Indian Wars might 
be studied; also the opening up of western Maryland by the coming 
of the Germans; but the main point has been accomplished. The chil- 
dren have worked their way through the study by living in the conditions 
of the colony and solving Leonard Calvert’s problems for him. To 
work such a plan out in detail, to give just enough to whet the appetite 
of the child and then make him think for himself, to have him live as 
a colonist of the times, interested particularly in the details of govern- 
ment that concern the colonists as a united body until finally a “two 
house” legislature is demanded because of the growth in population, 
area occupied, and interests represented, is a task for the skill of the 
teacher, and is worth while.

A LESSON IN NATURE STUDY INVOLVING A REAL PROBLEM 
This lesson was planned and taught very successfully in the 
third grade by Miss Roxana A. Steele of the Speyer School, 
Teachers College, Columbia University. 
Teacher's aims: — 
1. To teach pupils why and how to transplant. 
2. To prepare for the transplanting of the salvia plants in 
our school garden. 
Pupil’s aims: 
1. To be able to select good plants for transplanting. 
2. To know how to transplant in order to plant salvia plants 
without help.

Box of young salvia plants for 
observation and comparison with 
cabbage and tomato plants. 
(Salvia plants to be transplanted 
into garden later.) 
Advantages of transplanting: 
Plants get an early start. 
Opportunity for good arrange- 
ment. 
Disadvantages : 
Extra work. 
Extra care. 
Cabbage and tomato plants dis- 
carded by Teachers College gar- 
dener. 
I. Choice of Plants. 
Very small plants: 
Do not root well. 
Are slow in getting started. 
Large plants: 
Stalks too long and weak. 
Bend very easily. 
If used, need to be planted 
deep. 
Roots have not had room 
enough in hotbed. 
Medium-sized, strong plants: 
Best for planting. 
Good roots. 
Good stalk. 
Green leaves. the Teaching Process 
METHOD OF PROCEDURE 
What are we planning to do with 
our salvia plants when they are a 
little larger ? 
Why didn’t we plant the salvia 
seeds in the garden ? 
What are some of the advan- 
tages of transplanting? disad- 
vantages ? 
How many children feel that 
they know just the best way to 
transfer a plant? (Pupils’ Aim.) 
Do you think we can afford to 
practice with the salvia plants 
when we have so few? Who can 
suggest a good way to learn to 
transplant ? 
Let us look at those cabbage 
and tomato plants which I have 
brought from Teachers College 
and see what we think about them. 
These are from the box from 
which plants were selected by the 
gardener last week. 
I shall divide the plants into 
small, large, and medium-sized. 
Tell which you think are best for 
transplanting and why. 
Why would you not select the _ 
very small ones? the very large 
ones ? 
When a gardener has not enough 
fine, straight plants, can you think 
of a way of planting by which he 
might use a crooked plant?

Now that we know what kind of 
a plant to select, can you think of 
something else we must learn be- 
fore we are ready to transplant 
our salvia plants? 
(Statement of Pupils’ Aim.) 
Can you think of some things 
which might help a very young 
plant to get a good start? 
Has any child ever seen a farmer 
plant cabbage or tomato plants? 
Tell us exactly how he did it and 
why. 
Several children who can select 
a good plant may plant them in 
this box of earth. The class will 
decide whether they are good gar- 
deners. 
Each child will have an oppor- 
tunity to plant a salvia plant in 
the garden. Can you tell which 
plants will be most liable to grow 
well? 
A LESSON PLAN IN GEOGRAPHY WHICH IS PREDOMINANTLY 
DEDUCTIVE 
The study of maps forms the basis for inferences which are 
later verified by referring to the text. This plan was written by 
Miss Mary F. Kirchwey of the Horace Mann School, Teachers 
College, Columbia University. This lesson was most success- 
fully taught to sixth-grade pupils in the Horace Mann School. 
Teacher’s aim: To teach the geography of India and to give 
practice in the application of principles of geography known 
by the pupils. 
     
-P-A-G-E-212
  198 A Brief Course in the Teaching Process 
Children’s aim: Why do they have such terrible famines in 
India ? 
Supyecr MATTER 
Failure of crops — dense popula- 
tion directly dependent upon agri- 
culture for a living — lack of suffi- 
cient means of transportation. 
We have abundant rainfall — 
temperature favorable to crops — 
great land area in proportion to our 
population. 
In Egypt — even as far back as 
in the days of Joseph (Bible) — 
also in recent years. 
Nile’s overflow less abundant 
than usual — dense population. 
Location and approximate extent 
of the Indus Valley. 
Between latitudes 23° and 30° N. 
the temperature is warm. 
Florida is in about the same 
latitude, but the extremes of tem- 
perature are not so great owing to 
the water mass that surrounds it 
and tempers both heat and cold. MeEtHoD oF PROCEDURE 
What is a famine? 
Sufficient conversation to im- 
press upon the children the suffer- 
ing attendant upon famine. 
What are some of the conditions 
that bring about a famine? 
Have you ever heard of famines 
in our country? Why not? 
In what part of the world have 
you heard of famines ? 
What were some of the causes 
of famine in Egypt? 
The Indus Valley in India is 
one of the regions that is subject 
to terrible famines. Let us see if 
we can find the reason for it. 
Point out the Indus on the map. 
Where does itrise ? Where empty ? 
Draw your pointer along the length 
of the valley — across it. 
In what latitude is it? 
What temperature conditions 
must prevail there? What part 
of North America is in about the 
same latitude? What do you 
know about the temperature of 
Florida? Do you think that the 
Indus Valley has about the same 
temperature? Look carefully at

the location of both places ~ 
Florida and the Indus Valley. 
Can you see any reason for think- 
ing that temperature is not the 
same? How are the summer and 
winter temperatures of Florida 
affected by the waters about it? 
How are the summer and winter 
temperatures of the Indus Valley 
affected by the land mass about it ? 
Find out whether your conclu- 
sions are right. 
Is the temperature of Florida 
favorable or unfavorable to crops ? 
Is a temperature somewhat 
hotter in summer and colder in 
winter unfavorable to crops? 
Is there anything, then, in the 
temperature of the Indus Valley 
that explains their famines ? 
We must evidently look for 
some other cause for the famines. 
Upon what other climatic con- 
ditions do crops depend ? 
In what wind belt does the 
Indus Valley lie? 
From what general direction 
do the trades blow in the northern 
hemisphere ? 
Let us see if there is ever any 
exception to this rule. How does 
the temperature of the land com- 
pare with the temperature of the 
water in summer? What effect 
has this upon the air over the land ? 
What naturally follows?  
-P-A-G-E-214
200 A Brief Course in the Teaching Process 
From a general southerly direc- 
tion. 
Arrows on map show that the 
winds come from the southwest. 
From the northeast in winter. 
From the southwest in summer. 
There can be practically no 
rainfall in the Indus Valley in 
winter because the winds blow over 
the great land mass of eastern and 
south-central Asia before reaching 
the Indus and have lost their 
moisture. 
There is more rainfall in summer 
because the winds from the south- 
west come directly from the 
ocean. The valley lies so low, 
however, that the winds sweep 
over the southern part of it without 
having much of their moisture 
condensed. There is little con- 
densation until they near the high- 
lands on the north. 
Refer to rainfall maps which 
show well-watered regions in the 
upper valley — desert in the lower. 
Generally favorable in the upper 
valley — unfavorable in the lower. 
The Nile Valley — Egypt. 
The annual overflow of the 
river. From what direction, then, do 
the winds blow in India? 
Turn to the map of the winds 
and find the exact direction. These 
winds are called the Southwest 
Monsoons. 
Tell again from what direction 
the winds of India come. 
What, then, do you conclude as 
to the rainfall of the Indus Valley 
in winter? Is there apt to be more 
or less rainfall in summer? Why? 
Look at the map very carefully 
and see if it is likely that even the 
summer winds bring much rainfall. 
Is the rainfall equally light all 
through the valley? Where is it 
apt to be heaviest? Why? 
Prove that your conclusions 
are correct. 
Would you then say that the 
rainfall is favorable or unfavorable 
for agriculture ? 
Does this mean, necessarily, 
that agriculture cannot be carried 
on in the lower valley ? 
What other river valley have 
you studied that is noted for its 
agriculture in spite of a very light 
rainfall ? 
What makes agriculture pos- 
sible in the Nile Valley? 
 
-P-A-G-E-215
  Lesson Plans 
The heavy precipitation in the 
mountainous districts that feed its 
tributaries. 
Indus has many tributaries that 
rise in the Himalayas. In the 
summer, when the snows on the 
mountains melt, these tributaries 
carry to the main stream such a 
quantity of water that an inunda- 
tion results. 
Overflow is less and a corre- 
spondingly smaller area productive. 
Character of the soil. 
River valleys in general have a 
rich soil. A river that overflows 
leaves a deposit of rich mud that 
makes its banks very fertile. 
Favorable — warm climate, rich 
soil, overflow of the river. 
Unfavorable — scanty rainfall. 
Crops grow so rapidly and easily 
when rains do not fail, that vast 
numbers of the people engage in 
farming. It is almost purely an 
agricultural region. 
It has attracted vast numbers of 
people. 
Principal products — millet, 
rice, cotton, sugar cane, wheat, 
tea. 
Practically all needed for home 
consumption. 
More railroads might be built 201 
To what is the overflow of the 
Nile due? 
Is there anything in ‘the loca- 
tion of the Indus that makes it 
likely that it, too, overflows? 
What is the result if the rainfall 
is less abundant than usual? 
Upon what beside temperature 
and rainfall does the productive- 
ness of a region depend? 
Can you come to any conclusion 
in regard to the soil of the Indus 
Valley ? 
State again the conditions in the 
valley that are favorable to agri- 
culture. Those that are unfavor- 
able. 
What has been the effect of these 
physical conditions upon the oc- 
cupations of the people? 
What has been their effect upon 
the density of population ? 
What crops would you expect 
to find in the Indus Valley? Con- 
sult your textbooks and see what 
else is grown there. 
Do you think that much is ex- 
ported? Why, then, do they have 
such terrible famines in India? 
Can you suggest anything that 
 
-P-A-G-E-216

in order that food products could 
be carried readily from one section 
to another. 
Better methods of 
might be employed. irrigation A Brief Course in the Teaching Process 
might be done to lessen the danget 
of famine ? 
Consult your textbooks and see 
what steps have already been taken 
More variety of occupation in this direction. 
might be introduced, so that fewer 
people would be directly dependent 
upon agriculture for a living. 
A LESSON FOR APPRECIATION 
A lesson for appreciation which includes creative and inter- 
pretative work. The interpretation of the song in the dance, 
or dramatic game. 
This lesson was planned and taught to a group of second- 
grade children by Miss Eleanor Wright of the Speyer School, 
Teachers College, Columbia University. 
The lesson was based upon the little German folk song which

Lesson Plans 203 
Teacher's aims: — 
1. To have the children make a dance which will be suitable 
to the music of Das Steckenpferd. 
2. To help the children to appreciate this form of self-expres- 
sion, — expression by means of the whole body. 
Pupils’ aim: — 
To make a little ‘folk dance” which they will present at the 
May Festival for the entertainment of parents and friends.

2. One day, not long ago, 
Miss S., Miss T., and I 
were talking over our 
program for the May 
Festival, and we decided 
that the little people did 
not have enough to do. 
The first-grade children 
are to play a little story, 
and our two grades, you 
know, are to sing The 
Little Princess —so we 
thought that the sec- 
ond grade ought to have 
a little part of its own. 
Now what do you think 
itisto be? Iam going 
to tell you. 
3. Nature of the problem. 3. We are going to make 
our own little dance to 
the music of Das Pferd-

that will be very inter- 
esting ?
-P-A-G-E-218
B. 1. Set the standard for 
judging the value 
of the work done: 
that is, to have 
the dance tell the 
same story as the 
music.

familiar melodies, 
and show, in phys- 
ical expression, 
what they tell.

2. Bye-Low — girls. 
3. Robin Hood — part- 
ners. 
  204 A Brief Course in the Teaching Process 
1, When we made the 
tunes for our songs last 
winter, what did the 
music always have to 
tell ? 
Just so, as we make 
our dance to-day, it must 
tell the same story as the 
folk song. 
2. Let us sing one of our 
little songs that we have 
known for a long time, 
and see if we can tell, 
in a dance, how that 
makes us feel. 
Different children 
may here give different, 
individual _ interpreta- 
tions. Encourage much 
freedom. 
I am thinking of an- 
other tune that is quite 
different from this one. 
You may sing it with 
me if you like. 
Virginia may show us 
how that song makes 
her feel : what she wishes 
to do when she hears it. 
(Handle these two 
songs in a manner simi- 
lar to that used for the 
other two.) 
I am going to choose 
James to dance this, for 
he knows so much about 
soldiers.

A LESSON IN ARITHMETIC BASED ON A REAL PROBLEM WHICH 
WAS INTERESTING TO CHILDREN 
Such a lesson gives little opportunity for practice in arith- 
metical computation, but gives the very best possible motive 
for the drill work which is to follow. This lesson was planned 
and taught in the third grade of the Speyer School, Teachers 
College, Columbia University, bv Miss Roxana A. Steele.

  208 A Brief Course in the Teaching Process 
Teacher’s aims: To have children appreciate the practical 
value of itemized bills. 
To make children conscious of their need for the multipli- 
cation table of six. 
Pupil’s aim: To find the cost of the basket of food to be 
given to a poor family on Thanksgiving Day.

How many children know about 
the Thanksgiving baskets which 
are sent from the Speyer School ? 
You may tell the rest of the class 
how this work is planned for. 
Miss S. was telling me yester- 
day that a gentleman offered to pay 
for one of the baskets, but she did 
not know the value of one. She said 
that she knew the different articles 
which are put into the basket, but 
did not know the value of each. 
I thought Grade IIT could find the 
cost for her. Would you like to 
try to do it? (Pupils’ Aim.) 
Miss S. gave me a list of the 
things which are to go into the 
basket. 
As I put the list on the board 
try to think of the price of each 
article. 
We will choose the average price 
because our goods will be average

We cannot always follow in every detail the plan which 
we make for a lesson. It is interesting in this connection to : 
read Miss Steele’s accurate account of what actually hap- 
pened when the lesson, as planned above, was taught. The 
description which follows appeared in the Adlantic Educa- 
tional Journal for November, 1910. 
A PRACTICAL LESSON IN ARITHMETIC 
By Roxana A. STEELE, SPEYER ScHoon, TEACHERS COLLEGE, 
CoLumBIA UNIVERSITY 
Pupil’s aim: To find the cost of a Thanksgiving dinner. 
Teacher’s aim: To make children conscious of their needs in arith- 
metic. 
Last fall Grade Three had been studying the wholesale market in 
industrial work. The wholesale market was compared with the retail 
market, prices contrasted, etc., and much language and arithmetic work 
was based upon this work. 
A few days before Thanksgiving a gentleman stepped into the school 
office and offered to pay for one of the Thanksgiving baskets which the 
school sends out to poor families in the neighborhood. No one seemed 
to know the exact value of one of the baskets, so Grade Three was asked 
to make the estimate. 
This could have been done by an adult in a few minutes, but it would 
have been done no more accurately than the children were able to do it 
after having made a careful study of market lists. The exercise also 
furnished an excellent child’s aim for the arithmetic lesson. The class 
felt its responsibility and was anxious to do good work. 
The list of things generally put into one of the baskets was given to 
the class. The children decided upon the average price of each item. 
This called for an appreciation of the word average. The work was 
done orally with class discussion. For instance, when the price of a 
squash was asked, one child said “twelve cents,” another, “eighteen 
cents,” etc. The class finally agreed that a medium-sized squash would 
cost about fifteen cents.

The child who recorded the price of the squash on the board wrote 
fifteen cents —$.15. Before the lesson was over, several children had 
a little trouble in writing cents without dimes ($.06), keeping the money 
columns straight, using the dollar mark and decimal point, etc. With 
suggestions from other members of the class, the list was complete. 
In the item “6 lb. of beef @ 16%” the class found that it was neces- 
sary to multiply by six. As they had never had the six table, I did not 
expect them to be able to do it, but it chanced that one boy knew his 
six table and did the work readily. 
  Marion Thalman. Nov. 23, 1909. 
The Cost of a Thanksgiving Dinner 
1 squash $ .15 
2 cans of vegetables @ 10% 20 
3 qt. of potatoes @ 8% 24 
6 lb. of beef @ 16% -96 
2 qt. of apples @ 12# +24 
1 qt. cranberries 12 
1 Ib. sugar 06 
t Ib. nuts 18 
$2.15 
When the price of each item had been decided upon, the children 
found the total cost at their seats, and their results were compared. 
The lesson closed with the question, “What did you find out in to-day’s 
lesson?” The answers were: “The cost of a Thanksgiving basket”; 
“That Russell is the only child who knows his six table”; ‘That we 
need to write dollars and cents so that we won’t make mistakes.” 
At the beginning of the arithmetic lesson the following day, when 
the class was asked, “What do we need to do to-day?” there was a divi- 
sion of opinion as to whether the drill on dollars and cents or learning 
of the six table should come first. The decision was in favor of the drill 
on writing money, and the six table was presented later in the same 
period. 
The result of the lesson on the cost of the dinner was sent to the prin- 
cipal. The class received a note of thanks for the help which it had 
rendered. The children were proud of their accomplishment and anxious 
to work out more real problems.

  212. A Brief Course in the Teaching Process 
A LESSON FOR APPRECIATION 
Teacher’s aim: To help children to enjoy Stevenson’s 
Bed in Summer. 
Did any child in the room ever have to go to bed before it 
was dark? Did you ever get up in the morning before day- 
light ? Stevenson remembered how he used to feel when he 
had to go to bed before dark, and wroteastory about it. Would 
you like to hear the story ? 
Children’s aim: To enjoy Stevenson’s story about going 
to bed before dark. 
Supyject MATTER 
BED IN SUMMER 
“Tn winter I get up at night 
And dress by yellow candle light ; 
In summer quite the other way, 
I have to go to bed by day. 
“T have to go to bed and see 
The birds still hopping on the 
tree; 
And hear the grown-up people’s 
feet 
Still going past me in the street. 
“And does it not seem hard to 
you, When all the sky is clear and blue, 
And I should like so much to 
play, 
To have to go to bed by day?” Meruop oF PRocEDURE 
I want you to tell me all you 
can about the place where Steven- 
son lived, when I am through read- 
ing the story. 
Read the poem. 
Who will describe the place 
where he lived ? 
Were there other children who 
lived near by? 
Were there any trees near the 
house ? 
T'll read the poem again and you 
will see how many reasons Steven- 
son had for not wanting to go to 
bed by day. 
Read the poem again twice. 
Why does he tell you that he has 
to get up at night in the winter ? 
When do the birds go to bed? 
Do the grown-up people go to 
bed when children do? 
How was he able to see the birds, 
in the trees? Do you think he 
ever got out of bed?
-P-A-G-E-227
  Lesson Plans 213 
Do you think all the children in 
the street had to go to bed as early 
as Stevenson? Let me read the 
last stanza and see whether you 
can tell. 
Recall the Mother Goose Rhyme : 
“Girls and boys come out to play, 
The moon doth shine as bright 
as day; 
Leave your supper and leave 
your sleep, 
And come with your playfellows 
into the street.” 
How did Stevenson know the 
other children were in the street? 
Read the last stanza. 
T’ll read the whole story again, 
and then ask some one to tell me 
Stevenson’s story about going to 
bed in summer. 
Read the poem, calling attention 
to the different scenes: (1) The 
boy that gets up by night and 
dresses by yellow candlelight. 
(2) In summer quite the other way, 
he has to go to bed by day — he 
has to go to bed and see the birds 
still hopping on the tree and hear 
the grown-up people’s feet still 
going past him in the street. (3) 
The little boy lying in bed who 
feels very much abused. 
And does it not seem hard to you, 
etc.? Let us see all of the pictures 
again. Read in same way again. 
Who will tell the story? 
I am going to write it on the 
board, so that we can tell the story 
as Stevenson did. 
 
-P-A-G-E-228
  214 A Brief Course in the Teaching Process 
After the treatment indicated above, memorization will be 
very easily accomplished. The preliminary study for appre- 
ciation will make the poem mean more to the children than it 
could have meant had the teacher simply read it to the chil- 
dren two or three times and then asked them to memorize it. 
In a study lesson, the plans will vary from a single exercise 
in finding the principal thought in a paragraph to a develop- 
ment lesson, not dissimilar as to plan to other lessons of the 
same type. The recitation lesson may be a development 
lesson, inductive or deductive, or a drill lesson. The plans 
would therefore be similar to those given above. 
In conclusion, it may be suggested that any teacher who feels 
that it is impossible to plan all of her work will gain greatly if 
she will plan carefully for a single subject. As facility is gained 
in plan making, it will be possible to write plans for two or 
three or for more subjects. A topic plan should result in defi- 
niteness in the work of both teacher and pupils. Good plans 
give the teacher more freedom in conducting her work, and 
enable her to tell definitely the progress which the class has 
made. Plans are necessary in teaching. No one has a right 
to pretend to teach without previous thought concerning the 
subject to be taught, and the method to be employed in giving 
children command of this material.

The plans which follow were offered to teachers as suggestions rather 
than as outlines of subject matter or of procedure to be followed abso- 
lutely. Reorganize these plans so as to show subject matter and method 
separately. Add to the subject matter or method wherever necessary. 
If you think best, change the organization of material, the statement of 
aim, the references to books, and the like. Do not change the topic. 
As a result of your work you should be ready to present a plan for which 
you are willing to stand.

How did this make her act ? 
Did the hare expect to lose the race? ! Why not? 
gu The teacher may tell the story of th irl going to market with a 
basket of eggs on her head. She was so sure of getting 
sale for her eggs that she set to dreaming of the pretty 
things she would buy with the money she was to get for 
the eggs. She would buy, she thought, a bright new 
dress and a new hat; and then how mean and shabby 
she could make the other girls look; and how she could 
walk past them all, tossing her head in pride! Forget- 
ting that she was still only on her way to market, she 
then gave her head a proud little toss; and — what do 
you think happened ? 
Let the children give the story of the : mi and the Tortoise in their 
own words. 
What is likely to happen to any one of ts who is too sure of winning ? 
What will we say, then, of any one who is too sure of anything ? 
It has been said, “Count not your chickens before they are hatched.”

by drivers; their observation of the affection shown by 
a horse toward his master. 
General Condition of Horses : — 
Discuss the effect of grooming upon the horse’s coat. 
Why should the horse be fed regularly ? 
Why should ground food be given to an old horse whose teeth 
are poor ? 
Discuss the necessity of allowing the horse freedom in traveling. 
Temporary lameness is frequently due to a stone in the foot; 
how may it be removed ? 
What should be done for a horse that is seriously lame ? 
3. The economic value of such knowledge as the foregoing : — 
Horses are stiffened by standing unblanketed in the wind or 
cold. 
Foundering is caused by watering a horse when he is over- 
heated. 
A properly fitted harness and a comfortable checkrein, if any 
is used, save the strength of the horse. 
The selection of a horse whose strength and temperament fit 
him for his work adds to his value and usefulness. 
Skillful drivers, especially those who like their teams, can secure 
a great amount of work from them and yet save much 
of their energy. It frequently happens that after a day’s 
work one man will bring in a team comparatively fresh, 
while under a different driver the same team will be 
worried into exhaustion.

  CHAPTER XVII 
THE TEACHER IN RELATION TO SUPERVISION 
TEACHERS are generally responsible in some measure to one 
or more supervisory officers. Those who control the schools 
believe that better work will be done because of the supervision 
which is provided. It may not be out of place, therefore, in a 
book devoted to the problems of the teacher to consider the 
relation to supervision and to those who supervise her work. 
The fundamental purpose of supervision, whether of schools 
or of other activities, is increased efficiency of all who partici- 
pate in the work. Supervisors are worthy of the name only 
when they do their best to increase the efficiency of every teacher 
with whom they come in contact. Happily, this attitude of 
helpfulness characterizes most of those who are known as prin- 
cipals, primary or grammar-grade supervisors, subject super- 
visors, assistant and associate superintendents, and superin- 
tendents of schools. It may be that because of the great 
number of teachers employed in a system of schools some of 
these officers can have little direct relationship with individual 
teachers; but in the organization of the schools, by means of 
regulations, courses of study and the like, or through those 
who come directly in contact with teachers, these men and 
women seek to help each teacher to do better work. It is 
important that all teachers realize clearly the significance of 
the supervisor’s work, and that she avail herself of the help 
and coéperation which is thus provided. 
One of the functions of the supervisor is to criticize the work 
which is being done by individual teachers. It is especially 
difficult for some teachers to appreciate the purpose of such 
criticism, or to avail themselves of the aid which is offered in 
224 
 
-P-A-G-E-239
  
The Teacher in Relation to Supervision 225 
this form. Let us examine the different kinds of criticism 
which one may expect to receive, and try to discover how to 
get the most out of this instrument of supervision. 
There are supervisors whose criticism is occasionally purely 
negative. They come into the room, observe some of the 
work, and remark, either at the time or later, that the work was 
good, or that it was poor. It does not help one much, except 
in a feeling of good will toward the supervisor, when told that 
work is well done; nor is it very significant for future work 
that one’s efforts have been condemned. When the supervisor 
indulges in this type of criticism, the teacher has a right to ask 
him for the reasons which lead him to praise or to condemn. 
If excellent work is to be repeated, then the elements which 
have made for success should be pointed out. One may try 
to repeat good work and fail miserably because the elements 
in the excellent work which made for success have been over- 
looked in the second effort. Likewise failure may occur, even 
though it has been stamped as poor work, because the teacher 
fails to see the essential weakness of her effort. 
Most supervisors are able to find strength of some sort in 
the work of every teacher. It may be worth while for the 
teacher at times to ask for a discussion of the strong points in 
her work. This constructive appreciative criticism may help 
her to receive with open mind the destructive criticism which 
may be needed to bring about the elimination of weakness. 
Any teacher should welcome the criticism which frankly points 
out the deficiencies of her work and suggests the remedies 
which should be applied. We all want to do our best work. 
Unfortunately we cannot always see our teaching in true per- 
spective. The supervisor who comes in from the outside, as it 
were, with a wide range of experience in teaching and in ob- 
serving teachers can often give the suggestion which will make 
work, not only more efficient, but also more pleasant. 
It is a good rule for both supervisor and teacher to wait 
until the end of the day or even for two or three days after the 
Q
-P-A-G-E-240
  226 A Brief Course in the Teaching Process 
visit before the criticism is given. Snap judgments are apt to 
be wrong on both sides. The supervisor needs time to analyze 
the situation carefully in order to pick out the elements in the 
situation which are most significant and to overlook that which 
is trivial. The teacher will often be able to analyze her own 
work and to point out its defects, if time is given her to think it 
over. If the teacher can discover her own inefficiency, and 
if she is willing to talk frankly with the supervisor concerning 
these difficulties, the work of criticism will give satisfaction to 
both. A teacher has a right to ask for an appointment with 
a supervisor for the discussion of her work. Supervisors are, 
as a rule, only too willing to grant such a request. 
Criticism has not fulfilled its mission, if it stops with dis- 
covering to the teacher her strength and her weakness together 
with the analysis of the situation which enables her to repeat 
successes and avoid failures. A wide-awake teacher will be 
looking and asking for suggestions concerning new kinds of 
work. Suggestive criticism opens up the way for growth by 
giving the teacher the encouragement and help which are 
needed to undertake the new or unusual type of work. Many 
of the best teachers might have remained in the less efficient 
group, had it not been for the help and inspiration which was 
imparted by a wise supervisor. 
School exhibits are another means sometimes employed by 
the supervisory force to increase school efficiency. Here, again, 
the teacher should realize that the purpose of the supervisor is 
not to burden her with work, but rather to offer the help 
which may come from an exchange of experiences. The 
school exhibit which is most worth while does not require 
any special preparation of material on the part of the teacher. 
The work regularly done by children without corrections or 
refinement constitutes a true exhibit of the results secured. 
Any other kind of an exhibit is merely a test of the teacher’s 
ingenuity, her skill in masquerading under the names of her 
children.
-P-A-G-E-241
  The Teacher in Relation to Supervision 224 
When a genuine exhibit of children’s work is brought to- 
gether, it affords to teachers and supervisors alike a wealth of 
suggestion and help. The writer remembers visiting an ex- 
hibit of drawing and constructive work in one of our large 
cities. The supervisors of this work were in charge at regular 
hours each week. A very large number of teachers came to 
see what was being done by other teachers in their grade. A 
special feature of the exhibit was an abundance of suggestions 
for the work of the next week provided by the supervisors and 
taken from the work of previous years. The consultation 
between supervisors and teachers concerning the work exhib- 
ited, and with reference to the work both past and yet to be 
done, was free from restraint and often lasted ten, fifteen, or 
even twenty minutes. Needless to say, the results achieved in 
drawing and constructive work in this city were far above the 
average. Similar exhibits of work in English composition, 
arithmetic, some phases of the work in literature, nature study, 
history, and geography are possible and cannot fail to help the 
teacher who is anxious to improve her work. 
Visiting the work of other teachers has one advantage not 
possessed by the exhibit: it is possible to see not only the re- 
sult but also the methods which are employed in securing the 
product. A good supervisor should be able to tell teachers 
where to go to see the kind of work which is most helpful. 
Any teacher should welcome the opportunity to see the work 
of a teacher who is strong where she is weak. Random visit- 
ing is not worth much. What counts is a visit to a teacher 
who has some help to offer, in order to satisfy a real need. 
Often the most profitable visiting can be done within the sys- 
tem in which the teacher works. Not infrequently thegreatest 
help can be secured from another teacher in the same building. 
Whenever or wherever a teacher visits, the important thing is 
to look for the strong points in the work. The teacher who 
goes for help will not be disappointed; the one who looks for 
defects, who is hypercritical, will not profit by the time used.  
-P-A-G-E-242
228 A Brief Course in the Teaching Process 
After a visit to a teacher whose work is known by the super- 
visor, a conference may be held, or a report given by the visit- 
ing teacher. If the visit is worth making, it is worth some 
further consideration. It will help the teacher to talk over 
the visit with the supervisor with particular reference to her 
own work. The elements of strength in the work of the 
teacher visited can thus be determined, and the modifications 
in the work of the visitor desired by the supervisor be made 
definite. 
Examinations have from time immemorial been used by 
supervisors to determine the success of school work. Teachers 
not infrequently seem to feel that they are an unnecessary 
hardship imposed without sufficient justification, whether 
teacher or pupils are considered. Let us inquire what examina- 
tions should mean to the teacher. First of all, it may be worth 
while to remember that the command of some knowledge, and 
the ability to use it when demanded, should form a part of the 
equipment of children who are being educated. It is well at 
times to stop and discover how much children know, and what 
facility they show in using their knowledge. It is a shock 
sometimes to discover that a room full of enthusiastic, well- 
behaved children do not know their multiplication tables, 
cannot add, subtract, or divide without making many mis- 
takes, cannot write an acceptable paragraph because of mis- 
takes in form which they should have mastered long ago, do 
not know on which side of the Ohio River to locate the state of 
Ohio; but that is just what is apt to happen in a school where 
examinations are never given. 
Success or failure in an examination should not be all-im- 
portant to children, nor should it lead to undue praise or con- 
demnation of teachers. The wise teacher will try to find in the 
results of the examination evidence of the deficiencies of her 
teaching. In the light of the work done by the children she 
can tell where she can depend upon their knowledge, what part 
of the work needs to be reviewed, which children need special
-P-A-G-E-243
The Teacher in Relation to Supervision 229 
help. An examination should be a taking of stock which will 
enable teacher and pupil to do more and better work, because 
each is acquainted with the needs of the situation better than 
before. 
Teachers’ meetings are worth just about what each indi- 
vidual teacher is willing to put into them. The teacher who 
comes to a meeting with her problems, willing to acknowledge 
that she needs help, and anxious to get it will not find these 
gatherings dull or uninteresting. If the meeting is organized 
for study, as is done in connection with reading circle work, the 
meeting can be transformed from a perfunctory recitation of 
the ideas of the book into a live professional discussion, by 
the activity of two or three earnest teachers. If the meetings 
are not good, individuals are at fault; if these teachers become 
active, if they try to make the most out of these discussions, 
their attitude will change. 
One of the best types of teachers’ meetings is centered round 
the actual teaching of children by a member of the group, to be 
followed by discussion of the work done. There is no more 
certain way to grow professionally than to be willing to demon- 
strate your theory by practice, or to discuss the work which is 
done by other members of the group. In several of our cities 
these lessons, taught sometimes by the supervisors and at other 
times by the teachers themselves, have become a regular fea- 
ture of the year’s work. The teacher who is most anxious to 
grow will be the first to avail herself of the opportunity to 
teach such a lesson. Supervisors sometimes hesitate to suggest 
this kind of a program for teachers’ meetings, because teachers 
are so unwilling to do their part in making the work a success. 
It is a poor professional spirit which is not strong enough to 
lead a teacher to accept the criticism of her fellow teachers, 
when she knows that therein lies the possibility of growth. 
Any group of teachers who will voluntarily participate in such 
work will find that the teachers’ meeting, instead of being a 
bore, will come to be looked upon as the brightest spot in the

  230 A Brief Course in the Teaching Process 
* whole week, because of the help and inspiration which is de- 
rived from the hour’s work. 
Institutes were once looked upon as places where teachers 
came to be entertained, or, possibly, to be inspired. There 
was a time when the best institutes were conducted on the 
“pouring in” plan. A lecturer, or several lecturers, dispensed 
the truth, and teachers sat in their places, supposedly drinking 
deep draughts from these fountains of wisdom. It is strange 
that all of the theory of teaching which was dispensed did not 
suggest that the manner of conducting the institute was wrong. 
In our best institutes to-day teachers participate in discus- 
sion, study and recite from books, undertake the revision or 
organization of courses of study in codperation with their 
supervisors; in short, the institute has become a school for 
professional study. In such an institute, as in teachers’ meet- 
ings, those who come with real problems, anxious to get help, 
find the week or two all too short. Agroup of teachers anxious 
to grow professionally can, in most cases, secure the codperation 
of supervisors in transforming an institute which is organized 
on the old basis. 
If a teacher’s supervisors are not helping her, it may be well 
to inquire whose fault it is. ‘The teacher who meets the super- 
visor halfway, the one who invites criticism, who avails her- 
self of the help and suggestion which may come from exhibits, 
visiting, teachers’ meetings, and institutes will, in all probabil- 
ity, grow strong enough to help others. She may in her turn 
be called upon to accept the responsibilities, the trials, and the 
joys of a supervisor.!

  CHAPTER XVIII 
THE TEACHER IN RELATION TO THE COURSE OF STUDY 
TEACHERS sometimes look upon the course of study merely 
as a demand made by those in control of the school system for 
a large amount of work to be accomplished. The course of 
study indicates that certain topics in English, arithmetic, 
nature study, geography, history, industrial arts, and the other 
subjects of the curriculum are assigned to the grade, and the 
teacher expects that her pupils will be examined on this work 
at stated times during the year in order to determine the effi- 
ciency of her work and the fitness of the children for promotion. 
From this point of view, the course of study is an ever present 
taskmaster, always urging that more work be accomplished. 
Let us inquire whether this is in reality the meaning of the 
course of study to the teacher. 
In the first place, all will admit that in any system of schools 
it is necessary to determine somewhat definitely the work to 
be done by a given grade. If such provision were not made, 
it would be impossible to transfer children from one school to 
another, and very difficult for the supervisory force to render 
help to large numbers of teachers. Then, too, there is an order 
in the development of subjects, which is necessary both from 
the standpoint of the subject and from the point of view of the 
child who is to gain the experience which the subject offers. 
It is true that a course of study which is made to fit all of 
the children of a great city or state must be interpreted liber- 
ally, if good teaching is to be done. To this end, our best 
courses of study demand that a minimum amount of work be 
done by all teachers, and suggest alternative and optional work 
to meet the needs of children whose experiences are varied, 
232
-P-A-G-E-247
The Course of Study 233 
and whose needs are correspondingly different. In any pro- 
gressive school system, the capable teacher has opportunity 
to vary the material presented under the head of the various 
subjects in such a manner as will satisfy the interests and the 
problems of the group of children for whose growth she is 
responsible. 
A good course of study will save the teacher much time and 
energy by the organization of material which it presents. In 
many of our larger cities a volume of from fifty to two hundred 
pages has been prepared for each subject. These manuals 
suggest the order in which it has been found by experience that 
the topics can best be presented. In many cases a helpful 
analysis of each large topic from the point of view of presenting 
it to children is included. Besides this organization of material, 
references which will prove helpful to the teacher, both from 
the standpoint of subject matter and of method, are included 
in our best courses of study. In many cases suggestions for 
teaching, elaborated at times into complete lesson plans, are 
given. 
In the making of the course of study, the teacher should 
welcome any opportunity to contribute her knowledge con- 
cerning the availability of material or the methods to be used 
in her grade. Any good course of study should be the joint 
product of at least three classes of people: the expert in the 
subject, the expert in supervision and administration of schools, 
and the expert teacher. The subject matter expert is needed 
to pass upon the material from the standpoint of fact and from 
the point of view of one who sees the beginnings of a subject 
in relation to the whole field. The supervisor has to provide 
for the proper relation of the different subjects, determines the 
amount of time to be devoted to the subject, and the general 
method of procedure in teaching the subject. The teacher 
needs to advise as to the practicability of the whole scheme. 
She has in mind a particular group of children with certain 
experiences, interests, and abilities, and her judgment is prob- 
 
-P-A-G-E-248
  234 A Brief Course in the Teaching Process 
ably safer than either of the others as to the availability of any 
particular topic or phase of the subject. In addition to this 
service, any group of teachers can give most significant help 
with respect to the methods which have proved most helpful. 
Indeed, our courses of study could be made much more helpful 
if teachers were only asked to give suggestions concerning 
the organization of material and methods of teaching, which 
they are so well equipped to offer by reason of their experience 
in teaching the subject to children. Happily, the practice of 
inviting the codperation of teachers in making the course of 
study is becoming more common in our cities. . Any capable 
teacher who is anxious to participate in the organization of the 
curriculum will find opportunity to make her contribution. 
Possibly there are teachers who, because of the very excel- 
lence of the courses of study provided, feel that all that is re- 
quired for them is to follow blindly the directions given. In- 
stead of considering the course of study as a hard taskmaster, 
they look upon it as a crutch upon which they lean heavily. 
For these teachers there is little need for preparation. The 
course of study and the textbooks have solved the problems of 
teaching. Let us inquire just what the curriculum of our 
schools stands for before attempting to decide just what rela- 
tion the teacher bears to it. 
A course of study is not so much knowledge to be poured in. 
Rather it represents possible experiences for which children 
may have need, experiences which will aid them in the solu- 
tion of their problems and make possible for them the realiza- 
tion of their purposes. How did all of this knowledge come to 
be preserved, and how did it happen to be arranged in groups 
labeled by certain names? Men have preserved from time 
to time, by handing down by word of mouth or by records 
made on stone, wood, skin, paper, or other surfaces, knowledge 
which they have found useful in meeting the problems which 
confront them. For convenience of reference this knowledge 
has come to be grouped, and to each group a name has been
-P-A-G-E-249
The Course of Study 235 
applied. If we could only remember how we came to have this 
body of knowledge, how it happened to be thought worth while 
to preserve the experiences which when grouped together we 
know as subjects, it might make us a little more judicious in 
our attempt to acquaint children with their inheritance. 
Our schools have all too frequently acted upon the principle 
that children could assimilate the school subjects without 
reference to their past experience or their present needs. It has 
been common to say, teach so much of this or that subject, 
just as if the child mind was a receptacle to be filled. The 
difficulty of this attitude toward school subjects is twofold: 
first, the children fail to gain any appreciation of the experi- 
ences involved; and, second, they fail to gain from the process 
the power of independent thought, or the spirit of investiga- 
tion which it is the purpose of education to impart. 
The doctrine of formal discipline, as commonly interpreted, 
has been largely responsible for our wrong idea of the meaning 
of subjects of study. The idea that any study, especially if it 
proved disagreeable to the pupil, and had no definite relation- 
ship either to his past experiences or present needs, would 
mean most for his education, has not yet entirely disappeared. 
Aside from the psychological fallacy involved, that ability 
to do one kind of work would spread or be available for all 
other kinds of mental activity which we call by the same gen- 
eral name, the devotees of the doctrine ignored the fact that 
the maximum of activity or hard mental work could be secured 
only under the stimulus of genuine interest. 
Possibly the introduction of the industrial arts? and the 
more rational approach which they demand, may serve to 
illustrate the method to be used in teaching other subjects.

236 A Brief Course in the Teaching Process 
In cooking, for example, we would hardly expect to have a 
child begin by engaging in an exercise in beating eggs without 
reference to any problem which required this activity. If chil- 
dren are to learn something of wood and its use in our in- 
dustries, we commonly expect them to gain some knowledge 
of the processes involved in the course of the construction of 
furniture for the playhouse, a flower box for the window, a sled, 
a checkerboard, or some other interesting project. It is true 
that the industrial arts lend themselves more readily to the 
dominant interests of children to do and to make than do most 
school subjects. If these activities, which are essentially the 
activities characteristic of our modern civilization, be used to 
best advantage, they will offer many opportunities for making 
significant the other subjects. 
Any considerable participation in the processes which are 
fundamental to the great industries cannot fail to arouse an 
interest in the source of materials, the development of the in- 
dustry, and a desire to express one’s self with reference to the 
work which is being done. From the interest in the source of 
materials grows naturally the work in nature study and geog- 
raphy. The development of the industry takes us back even 
to the time of primitive man, and history becomes significant. 
The handling of materials in construction suggests the need of 
measurement, and arithmetic is provided for. In all of this 
work there will be a demand for communication, the necessity 
to learn what others have recorded in books, and the wish to 
express one’s own experience in oral and written speech. The 
experiences of people like ourselves, as idealized in literature, 
will make its appeal in spite of the worst our teaching can do. 
It is not maintained that all subject matter groups itself natu- 
rally around industrial activities, and that these activities 
should, therefore, form the center of the curriculum; rather, it 
is sought to emphasize the relationships to the real needs of 
children and the possibility of utilizing these genuine motive 
in the teaching of school subjects.
-P-A-G-E-251
  The Course of Study 237 
We teach the subjects of the curriculum in order that chil- 
dren may understand their environment, be adjusted to it, and, 
as President Butler puts it, come into possession of their spir- 
itual inheritance. Out of the work which is done, these same 
children should gain power to adapt themselves to new con- 
ditions and should be equipped to render service in the prog- 
ress which is yet to be made in our society. Now one’s 
adjustment to the present environment must be an adjustment 
to his environment, a solution of his problems as they at pres- 
ent exist. Future adaptability is conditioned by the ex- 
perience which one has had in making such adjustments. 
The ability to contribute to the progress in which each should 
participate is dependent, not so much upon the number of facts 
one possesses, as upon the attitude of investigation which 
characterizes him, the respect for truth, and ability to think 
straight which have been developed by his education. From 
whatever point of view we approach the problem of teach- 
ing our subjects, the answer is the same: meet present situ- 
ations, solve present real, vital problems, make subject 
matter meet the needs of the children you are teaching. 
This analysis of the curriculum makes apparent the impor- 
tant part to be played by the teacher in making available 
the experiences which the school subjects are organized to 
present. 
The courses of study may present much that is helpful in 
the organization of material, the suggestions for teaching may 
be gathered from the experience of many teachers, and still 
the great problem of making these subjects vital to children 
remains as the work of every teacher. Motives which grow 
out of the experience which children have already had must 
be sought. The material to be presented will be significant 
in the experience of these children only when they approach 
it in order to satisfy their real needs. Aside from the possibil- 
ity of finding in one of the subjects, as, for example, the in- 
dustrial arts, a motive for other work, the school situation 
 
-P-A-G-E-252
    238 A Brief Course in the Teaching Process 
itself presents many opportunities for discovering real needs 
to children. 
The school festival, school parties for parents, fairs and 
sales, the general assembly, excursions, gardening or other 
industrial activity, plays and games, have in the hands of 
skillful teachers provided a compelling motive for a great 
variety of school work. The author would not deny the power 
of intellectual interest, but he knows, as does every other teacher, 
that with children in the elementary school this motive is only 
gradually developed. The teacher who is alert to find some 
real need for the computations of arithmetic; who gives a 
genuine opportunity for oral or written expression; who ap- 
peals to the desire to use the knowledge gained in history and 
geography by means of the historical festival, the article in the 
school paper, and the like, as well as to the curiosity of the child ; 
who allows children to make real things which satisfy their 
individual or collective needs in the industrial arts, — is the 
teacher who is teaching school subjects in the way that will 
mean most in the education of her pupils. 
The demand that the teacher vitalize the curriculum does 
not lose sight of the necessity for drill, or of the demand that 
children know, as a result of their education. As a matter of 
fact, the more vital the experiences, the more apparent it be- 
comes to both teacher and pupil that the fixing of knowledge or 
the acquiring of skill is a necessary condition of present efficiency 
and of future progress. The children who have the most 
genuine need for the multiplication table will be the first to 
learn it. If you are to read to a whole school and want to 
have them enjoy with you the selection which you are to in- 
terpret, you will have the best possible reason for good ex- 
pression. History means something, if you really need to 
know the history of a period in order to reproduce accurately 
its language, manners, dress, and the like in your festival. 
The mistake which at times has been made by enthusiastic 
teachers of neglecting the drill side of the work, has not been
-P-A-G-E-253
  The Course of Study 239 
due to any difficulty which the situation presented from the 
standpoint of the children who are engaged in meaningful 
activities. 
The teacher may not expect all children to gain equally in 
command of the experiences represented by the course of study. 
For her there must literally be courses of study for each sub- 
ject, in that she must adapt her work in so far as is possible to 
individual needs. The office of teacher may well be exalted, 
for it is the teacher who must, because of her insight, provide 
for the needs of each child committed to her care, and in ren- 
dering this service provide society with its greatest asset, a 
truly educated human being.

The chief difficulty in the work of this grade is in teaching the arith- 
metical forms as applied to concrete processes. Pupils should know 
very thoroughly the work given on pages 1 to 23, Cook and Cropsey’s 
Arithmetic, before any new forms are taught. They have up to this 
time used the arithmetical signs and the sentence, and have stated results 
only. New forms for addition and subtraction are first applied to con- 
crete processes on page 24. No other forms should be taught until

pupils are very familiar with these. A drill should be given showing 
that these two forms are identical and that we must first know what we 
wish to use them for, if applied to problems. Write 9

Pupils should be eer familiar with these forms before any written 
concrete work is given. 
When the new form for multiplication is introduced, this drill should 
be repeated :

t2 Ea xa Ir 7 18 
Nothing new should be added to this until pupils can use these forms 
without confusion. 
When presenting the new forms for division and partition the same 
method may be used, but pupils should use the form for division some 
weeks before using the same form for partition. It is not necessary to 
use the division form for partition until the last four weeks of the term, 
and not even then, if there seems to be any danger of confusion in using 
the same form for both processes. The terms division and partition 
should not be used. The terms measure and finding one of the equal 
parts can be easily understood. Pupils should be able to read arith- 
metical forms well, before any use is made of these forms in their applica- 
tion to written concrete work. 
All concrete problems should be simple and within the child’s experi- 
ence:

they are engaged. They will keep a record of all expenses for materials

nection with history, they have opportunity to use all standards of 
measurements. Number is demanded in almost all experimental science 
work ; for instance, the amount of water contained in the different kinds 
of fruit, or the amount of water evaporated from fruits under different 
conditions (in drying fruits). All plans for wood work will be worked 
to a scale and demand use of fractions. When the children have en- 
countered many problems which they must solve in order to proceed 
with their work, they are ready to be drilled on the processes involved 
until they gain facility in the use of these. The children should be able 
to think through the problems which arise in their daily work, and have 
automatic use of easy numbers, addition, subtraction, multiplication, 
short division, and easy fractions.

CHAPTER XIX 
MEASURING RESULTS IN EDUCATION 
Erricrency in any line of human endeavor depends upon 
our ability to evaluate the results which are secured. No one 
would question the progress which has been made in education 
during the past hundred years; but one may very justly in- 
quire concerning the efficiency of the work that has been done 
from the standpoint of the money which has been spent, and 
the effort and devotion of those who have engaged in teaching. 
In the mercantile pursuits it has been noted that seven out of 
every ten failures can be charged directly to a lack of knowl- 
edge of facts. Such investigations as we have had in educa- 
tion tend to prove that a like situation is to be found in this 
field. The failures in education, whether due to a lack of 
economical use of the funds available, to an inefficient system 
of organization, or to unintelligent practices in method, are, 
on the whole, not to be charged to a lack of devotion on the 
part of those who have given their lives to the schools. Until 
it is possible to measure the results achieved, the facts of suc- 
cess or failure cannot be established. 
Of course, no one would deny that real progress is made by 
the process of trial and success, both in the art of teaching and 
in the practice of administration. It is true, too, that we shall 
have to depend in considerable measure upon demonstration 
as a means of bringing about improvement in current educa- 
tional practice. It is none the less true, however, that scien- 
tific work in education will furnish the basis for the more rapid 
elimination of the mistakes in current practice, as well as point 
the way for improved organization of teaching. The science 
of education will, in its development, occupy relatively the 
247 
 
-P-A-G-E-262
    248 A Brief Course in the Teaching Process 
same position with reference to the art of teaching that the 
science of medicine occupies with respect to the art of healing. 
The progress which has been made during the past twenty-five 
years in the art of farming would never have been possible 
without the scientific work that has been done in agriculture. 
Aside from the fact that we are only beginning to have a 
profession of education, many other factors have entered to 
delay the progress in the direction of standardizing our work 
by means of accurate measurement of the results achieved. 
One of the most comforting of the fallacies which are at times 
urged against the attempt to measure results is found in the 
popular statement that the only criterion by which the success 
of school work can be measured is found in the ultimate success 
of the individuals who are subjected to the process. The most 
inefficient teacher in the most poorly equipped school, if his 
period of service has been long enough, will point to the success 
of a few of the boys who once attended that particular school, 
as proof of the adequacy of the work which is now being done. 
The failures are never brought tomind. The fallacious reason- 
ing found in such an appeal is all too common in our educa- 
tional discussion. To take a selected group of individuals, 
who have, because of native ability, and possibly because of 
favorable environment, achieved distinction; and to claim 
that this success is due to our system of education, may be 
satisfying to our pride, but cannot appeal to our good judg- 
ment. The only available measure of the success of the work 
done in any particular school is to be found in the changes 
which are brought about in boys and girls, young men and 
young women, during the period of their school life. 
It has been argued, too, that that which is most worth 
while in education cannot be measured. Those who advance 
this argument speak continually in terms of “atmosphere,” 
“spirit,” and the like. There are two replies to be made to this 
contention. The one is that any power which the teacher 
has, whether it is called influence, or ability to teach arith-
-P-A-G-E-263
  Measuring Results in Education 249 
metic, must result in some change in the children who are 
taught. Another equally valid answer is to be found in the 
fact that the best teachers of arithmetic, of literature, of 
geography, of history, and the other studies are, at the same 
time, the teachers whose influence we value most in the school. 
We have been hopeful that the sciences of biology, psy- 
chology, sociology, and economics would, in their develop- 
ment, solve the problems of education. No one would deny 
the significance of the work done in these fields as fundamental 
to the development of scientific work in education. No one 
is fully equipped to undertake investigation in the field of 
education without preliminary training in these fundamental 
sciences. Progress in the science of education has come, 
however, through the efforts of those men of sound funda- 
mental training who have attacked the problems of education 
as such, rather than through the work of the biologist, psy- 
chologist, sociologist, or economist. If we should wait for the 
sciences mentioned to solve our problems, progress would 
indeed be slow. 
Those who are unacquainted with modern statistical meth- 
ods as applied in the social sciences have at times felt that 
it was impossible to measure large groups of individuals who 
differ in ability, in interest, and in environment. It is im- 
possible within the limits of a brief chapter to make clear the 
validity of such measurement. It may be confidently asserted, 
however, that the measurement of a large group of individuals 
is, on the whole, more satisfactory than the attempt to measure 
a single individual. We can be more sure of the accuracy 
of our results in comparing two groups of children of a thou- 
sand each, than we could in the attempt to measure accurately 
, a single individual with regard to ability in school subjects. 
A most persistent objection to the measuring of results comes 
from those who feel that it is not fair to compare individuals 
or groups who are not alike in all particulars. They would 
claim, for example, that we cannot compare children in spelling 
   
-P-A-G-E-264
  250 A Brief Course in the Teaching Process 
ability when one group comes from homes in which the Eng- 
lish language is spoken, while the other comes from the homes 
of those who speak a foreign language. It is probable that 
this objection is due to a belief that measurement will result 
in a comparison of the present situation without any regard 
to the growth or development which has characterized the 
group. If we derive units of measurement in spelling, mani- 
festly the attempt would be to measure the changes which have 
been brought about in any group in terms of units which are 
comparable. If group one shows ability ten, having advanced 
during the year from ability seven, it will be considered just 
as satisfactory as the advance which has been made in group 
two, which has moved from ability eight to ability eleven. 
In other words, the purpose of measurement is never to attempt 
to make all alike. It is rather to discover differences and the 
reason for their existence; but most of all to give us some 
adequate means of determining progress or change. 
Let us suppose again, in a matter of business administration, 
that one school shows a much higher per capita cost than 
another. This does not prove that one school is more effi- 
ciently managed than another. What it does do is to suggest 
that some adequate reason is to be found for the difference 
which exists. In like manner, one city may show a much 
higher cost for janitors’ salaries than does another. This may 
suggest investigation, but it does not prove that the city with 
the higher cost for janitors’ service is inefficiently managed 
or extravagant in its expenditures. It may be that the city 
that spends a relatively large amount for janitorial service 
actually gets more per dollar for the money which it spends 
than does the city with the smaller cost. It is always a purpose 
of measurement to discover discrepancies and to raise problems. 
It has been contended that it is not important to derive 
scales or units of measurement on the ground that the scientific 
study of education is significant only in so far as it has to do 
with a careful investigation of the processes involved in growth,
-P-A-G-E-265
    Measuring Results in Education 251 
Those who make this contention seem to feel that a careful 
study of the way in which children come to form habits, to 
grow in power of reasoning, or in ability to appreciate, will give 
us the final answer concerning the methods to be employed in 
teaching. The difficulty with this point of view is that human 
beings, even though they be trained in investigation, are fallible. 
The only final test of the success of any method, however 
carefully derived, and however much of it may depend upon 
a knowledge of the processes involved in growth in the par- 
ticular aspect of mental life which is involved, is to be found 
in the result achieved. Theoretically a method may seem to 
be perfect, and yet in terms of the results which are secured it 
may prove to be a failure. If the results are not accurately 
measured, if we do not derive scales of measurement, we can 
never be certain of our conclusions with regard to the method 
to be employed in bringing about any particular type of mental 
growth or development. 
Possibly the one element in the situation which has operated 
to retard development in the direction of accurate measure- 
ment of results, more than any other, is the tendency in educa- 
tion to appeal to authority, and the corresponding lack of de- 
votion to scientific investigation. It is, of course, much easier 
to solve the problems which one meets by taking the opinion 
of those who have had experience in the field. No one would 
deny the value of the judgment of our great educational leaders. 
The fact remains, however, that these same leaders would be 
the last ones to place their own opinion in opposition to the 
results obtained from a careful scientific investigation. In- 
deed, it is in no small measure due to the insistence of these 
leaders that we are coming to have adequate investigations 
with regard to our educational practice. 
It has seemed necessary to discuss at some length the ob- 
jections which have been made against the attempt to measure 
results in education, rather than to devote more space to a dis- 
cussion of the work which has already been done. All students   
 
-P-A-G-E-266
  252 A Brief Course in the Teaching Process 
of education are familiar with the early work of Rice, and with 
the later contributions of Thorndike, Ayres, Cornman, and 
many others who have contributed to the literature of educa- 
tional investigation. Possibly the most significant piece of 
work that has been done is Thorndike’s scale for measuring 
handwriting.1 We may reasonably hope to have scales de- 
rived for the measurement of abilities in other subjects. 
In administration, considerable work has already been 
done with reference to the cost of education, both as regards 
the relationship of expenditure for education to other ex- 
penditures, the question of a proper distribution of money 
within the educational budget, and of the proper distribution 
of state school funds.” We can, of course, hope for much more 
significant work in this field as more adequate systems of 
accounting are introduced and more satisfactory reports are 
issued. It is noteworthy that in those school systems in 
which an attempt has been made to check up expenditures 
carefully, remarkable savings have been made. We have not 
yet reached the limit of possible reduction of expenditure with- 
out the sacrifice of our present efficiency. Much work has 
been done on problems of school organization, yet the problems 
of retardation and elimination will be satisfactorily treated 
only as we secure more accurate records concerning attendance, 
scholarship, health, promotions, and demotions, such as are 
provided for by the genetic records now kept in some of our 
more progressive school systems. The problems of depart- 
mental work and individual instruction can never be satis- 
factorily solved until we measure accurately the results 
secured under different systems of organization. 
Implicit in all of the argument which has been advanced in 
favor of measuring results is the contention that education 
means change. If changes are brought about in the children

of Education; Strayer, City School Expenditures.
-P-A-G-E-267
  Measuring Results in Education 253 
who are being educated, then there must be the possibility of 
measurement. These changes may take place in habit, in 
knowledge, in methods of work, in interests and ideals, and in 
power of appreciation. Probably no one would question the 
possibility of measuring the change which takes place in the 
formation of habits. We have quite commonly been willing 
to measure growth in knowledge by tests which demand that 
students not only remember facts, but that they show some 
ability to apply them. Whether or not a student commands 
a particular method of work can be determined by observa- 
tion of his method of procedure as well as by the results that 
he secures. If interests or ideals are changed, there necessarily 
follows a change in activity. Any real power of appreciation 
will be accompanied by some change in expression. 
The fact that we do not yet have scales or units of measure- 
ment which will enable us to evaluate accurately the results 
obtained in all of the different forms of school activity is not 
an argument against the possibility of measurement. In any 
field the development of units of measurement is dependent 
upon careful investigation, and upon a realization of the im- 
perfection of the units already used. It is only as we insist upon 
measurement that we can hope to have our units refined. 
Take for example the problem of grades or marks which are 
commonly assigned to students as a measure of their efficiency 
in doing school work. Any investigation of these units will 
show that there is very great variation in their application by 
different members of the teaching corps. 
The way to bring about a remedy is not to abolish all marks 
or grades, but rather to study the problem of the proper dis- 
tribution of marks, and, if necessary, to weigh differently the 
marks of different instructors. The more imperfect the unit 
of measure which we now apply, the greater the need for in- 
sisting upon accurate measurement. 
The first step in the development of scientific inquiry in any 
field is found in accurate description of the phenomena in-
-P-A-G-E-268
  254 A Brief Course in the Teaching Process 
volved. The demand that we measure results in education is 
simply a demand that the basis for scientific investigation be 
made available by means of this accurate description of the 
situation as it exists. Some investigators in education have 
already been able to take the further steps in scientific inquiry 
which have enabled them to foretell with considerable accuracy 
the results which might be expected in education under given 
conditions. Further progress is, however, dependent upon 
that sort of measurement which will discover problems which 
are not now clearly defined or which have not yet been thought 
of. Of course, as inferences are made in the light of the prob- 
lems suggested, there will be still further necessity for accurate 
measurement. When those who are charged with the re- | 
sponsibility of determining educational policy appeal to fact | 
rather than to opinion, when we are able to evaluate accurately 
that which we achieve, educational progress will be assured 
and a profession of education will have been established. 
We shall always have most excellent work in teaching 
done by those for whom scientific investigation, as such, means 
little. The investigations made will, however, modify the 
practice of these same teachers through changed demands and 
because of the demonstration of the validity of the new method 
of work by those who can appreciate the significance of results 
achieved by investigators. It is certainly to be expected that 
open-minded teachers will experiment for themselves and will 
aid in the work of the expert who must use the schools as his 
laboratory. Much depends upon the codperation and good 
will of all who are engaged in teaching. It is not too much 
to expect that the spirit of investigation will be found in large 
measure to characterize those whose privilege it is to provide 
the situation in which intellectual development is stimulated. 
Anexample of a study involving the codperation of the pupils, 
teachers, and supervisory officers of twenty-six separate schools 
or school systems is Dr. C. W. Stone’s study on Arith- 
metical Abilities and Some of the Factors Determining them.
-P-A-G-E-269
  Measuring Results in Education 255 
The following quotations from Dr. Stone’s study indicate the 
type of result which we may hope to get from such investiga- 
tions. 
In Reasoning 
The scores for the reasoning problems were determined from the 
results of two preliminary tests —one, giving one hundred 6th grade 
pupils all the time they needed to do the problems as well as they could 
in the order as printed (see page 11); and another, giving one hundred 
6th grade pupils all the time they needed to do the problems as well as 
they could in the reverse order from that as printed. The results as 
tabulated below in table II show that scores for reasoning problems of 
Grade VI pupils can be very definitely arranged in a scale on the basis 
of relative difficulty. Just what the scale should be can only be deter- 
mined by determining the form of distribution and the location of the 
zero point. From what is known of these the scale of weighting shown 
in the last column of table II is believed to be the best, and this is the 
one employed in the computations of this study. However, in order to 
enable the reader to satisfy himself as to which is the best method, the 
scores of the twenty-six systems were calculated on each of three other 
bases — (x) counting each problem reasoned correctly a score of 1; 
(2) counting each problem reasoned correctly a score based on the ratio 
of its difficulty as shown in the next to the last column of table II; and 
(3) counting the scores made on only the first six problems for which 
presumably all pupils of all systems had ample time. See Appendix, 
p. 98. 
In both reasoning and fundamentals the scores used as a measure of 
the achievement of a system were computed by combining the scores 
of one hundred pupils. Where more than one hundred pupils were 
tested, the papers used were drawn at random, the number drawn from 
each class being determined by the ratio of its number to the total num- 
ber tested in the system. Where less than one hundred pupils were 
tested, the combined scores made were raised to the basis of one hundred 
pupils.

Precautions observed to make the Scoring Accurate 
The simplicity of the tests made the scoring comparatively easy; and 
with the observance of the following precautions it is believed that a 
high degree of accuracy was attained. (r) In so far as practicable, all 
the papers were scored by a single judge — only two persons being em- 
ployed on any phase of the work for the entire twenty-six systems; 
(2) each problem was scored through one hundred or more papers, then 
the next followed through, etc.; (3) the score for each part of each 
problem, the errors, etc., were entered on a blank provided with a sepa- 
rate column for each item; (4) where there was doubt as to how the 
score should be made, the scorer made a written memorandum of how 
the case was finally decided and this memorandum served as the guide 
‘pr all future similar cases.

What the Scores Measure 
As used in this study the words achievements, products, abilities, 
except where otherwise qualified, must necessarily refer to the results 
of the particular tests employed in this investigation. That some sys- 
tems may achieve other and possibly quite as worth-while results from 
their arithmetic work is not denied; but what is denied is that any 
system can safely fail to attain good results in the work covered by 
these particular tests. Whatever else the arithmetic work may pro- 
duce, it seems safe to say that by the end of the sixth school year, it 
should result in at least good ability in the four fundamental operations 
and the simple, everyday kind of reasoning called for in these problems. 
It does not then seem unreasonable, in view of the precautions pre- 
viously enumerated, to claim that the scores made by the respective 
systems afford a reliable measure of the products of their respective pro- 
cedures in arithmetic. 
The Data 
The source of the data used to help answer the above questions is 
some six thousand test papers gathered from twenty-six representative 
school systems. Copies of the tests may be found in Part I, pages 10 
and 11; as may also a statement of conditions under which the tests 
were personally given by the author, page 13; and the method of scor- 
ing, pages 15 to 18. 
The achievements are considered from two standpoints — (1) the 
scores and mistakes of the systems as systems, (2) the scores of individual 
pupils as individuals. 
Table III gives the scores made in reasoning by each of the twenty- 
six systems, counting all the problems that were solved, and weighting 
them according to the last column of table II. The Roman numerals 
used in the left-hand column to designate the systems are those that fell 
to each system by lot. As seen by the column headed scores made, the 
systems are arranged according to number of scores, i.e. system XXIII 
made three hundred fifty-six points, the lowest score, and is placed first 
in the table; system XXIV made four hundred twenty-nine points, and 
is placed second, etc. System V, having made the highest score, is 
placed last in the table. 
The middle column gives the deviations from the median, which is 
that measure above and below which one half the cases lie. In this 
table the median is five hundred fifty-one. These deviations serve to

show the differences in scores made; and they are also employed in 
computing the measures of variability and relationship. The third 
column is the deviations in per cent of the median. It affords another 
expression of the difference in size of scores made by the systems. 
Table IV reads exactly as III, the scores? being those made on all 
problems of the test in fundamentals. These two tables give some 
general help on the nature of the product of the first six years of arith- 
metic work. One very evident fact is the lack of uniformity among 
systems; another is the lack of correspondence of relative position 
among the systems in the two tables. With the exception of systems 
XXIII and XIV, no system occupies the same relative position in the 
two tables, e.g. system XXIV stands second from the lowest in reason- 
ing and eighteenth from the lowest in fundamentals. This fact is more 
accurately summarized in the coefficients of correlation, table XV, 
Pe 37. As seen from its heading, table XXII gives the systems in order of 
achievements. These serial standings are derived from tables III and 
IV. Reading from the top, system XXIII has an average serial stand- 
ing of one, being lowest in both reasoning and fundamentals; system 
XXV ranks éhree in average serial standing, being fourth from lowest in 
reasoning and second from lowest in fundamentals; the readings for 
the other systems are similar. 
Tables XXIII and XXIV keep the same order of systems and show 
1In proceeding to the part of the study that is necessarily largely composed 
of tables, it may be well to state the position of the author regarding the partial 
interpretations offered in connection with the tables. It is that the entire 
tables give by far the best basis for conclusions; that for a thorough compre- 
hension of the study they should be read quite as fully as any other part; and 
that they should be regarded as the most important source of information rather 
than the brief suggestive readings which are liable to give erroneous impres- 
sions, both because of the limitations of a single interpretation and the lack of 
space for anything like full exposition. 
2 M = Median, which is the representation of central tendency used 
throughout this study. It has the adyantages over the average of being 
more readily found, of being unambiguous, and of giving less weight to 
extreme or erroneous cases. 
5For reliability of measures of reasoning ability, see Appendix, p. 100. 
? As stated in Part I, p. 17, a score is arbitrarily set at one. The fact that 
the zero point is unknown in both reasoning and fundamentals makes these 
scores less amenable to ordinary handling than they might at first thought 
seem. Hence, entire distributions are either printed or placed on file at Teachers 
College.

the time expenditure. The first line of table XXIII reads, — system 
XXIII ranks fourteenth from the lowest in time expenditure, with 1150 
week minutes devoted to arithmetic, 9675 week minutes devoted to all 
subjects, the 1150 week minutes devoted to arithmetic being 12 per 
cent of the 9675 week minutes devoted to all subjects. Similarly for 
the other systems, e.g. system XXV with a serial standing in abilities 
of three, and a serial standing in time expenditure of two, spends 722 
week minutes on arithmetic, and 8700 week minutes on all subjects, 
arithmetic costing 8 per cent of all the school time. The reader will 
recognize that the third column, which gives the time devoted to all sub- 
jects for one week of each of the first six years, gives the only new data of 
this table, column two being the same as given in table XXI and the 
first and fourth columns being derived from the others.
-P-A-G-E-276
  262 A Brief Course in the Teaching Process 
Probably the first essential shown by this table is the lack of corre: 
spondence between the serial standing in time cost and the serial stand- 
ing in abilities; e.g. the system with the lowest time cost is found by 
referring to table XIII to be system XXII, which is seen in table XXII 
to rank four and one-half in average abilities, Similarly, the system 
that ranks fifteenth in time cost, ranks fifth in abilities, etc. Another 
noticeable showing is the wide variability in the school time of the systems. 
It will be seen to vary from 7200 to 9900 week minutes. This time 
includes recesses, and it means that lengths of school days vary from an 
average of four hours to five and one-half hours. And if the names of 
the systems were given, it would be recognized that almost invariably the 
longer school hours are accompanied by the least amount of variation 
in program, such as physical education, field trips, assemblies, etc. Per- 
haps the other most striking fact of this table is the wide variation in 
the per cent of time devoted to arithmetic. It varies from 22 per cent 
for system IV to 7 per cent for system XXII, a difference of more than 
three to one. 
As table XXIV is part of the discussion of factors in time expendi- 
ture, its sample readings are given under that heading, page 62. 
The Relation of Time Expenditure to Abilities Produced 
The reader found one indication of the relation, or lack of relation, 
between time cost and products in tables XXII and XXIII. Each of 
the three following tables expresses these same facts.

1For the data from which these calculations were made, see first column 
of table XXI, p. 52, and the first columns of tables III and IV, p. 2r. The 
absence of known zero points makes such computations inadvisable except 
in connection with the more reliable evidence of the preceding table.
-P-A-G-E-278
  204 A Brief Course in the Teaching Process 
XXI. As measured by the time used in school, the thirteen systems 
with less than the median cost stand slightly the better; and as meas- 
ured by the time including home study, the thirteen systems with more 
than the median time cost stand somewhat the better. The time used 
in school is doubtless the more exact measure, but, as shown in table 
XXI, some systems depend on home study to a considerable extent. 
Hence both measures are used. The lack of relation indicated in this 
general way is shown more accurately in the table, page 263, in terms 
of coefficients of correlation. 
The order of systems in this table is determined by the first column, 
which gives the average serial standing as determined by the ratios of 
time to products. The right-hand column under each heading gives 
the ratio of time expenditure to abilities produced, and the left-hand 
column gives the serial order of that system as measured by the high- 
ness of the ratio, i.e. highness of cost per unit of product; e.g. in system 
IV the ratio of time to reasoning is 3.99 (see fourth column), the highest 
ratio in reasoning (determined by dividing the time cost, 1854 week 
minutes, by 464, the points made in reasoning). The ratio of time to 
fundamentals in this system is .52; giving an average ratio of 2.26. 
That is to say, the ratio of time to abilities in system IV is as 2.26 to 1, 
the highest among the twenty-six systems. 
That there is no direct ratio between time expenditure and abilities 
is again shown by this table. For example, system XXII, which spends 
the least amount of time (see table XX1I), ranks fourth from the lowest 
in abilities (see table XXII), ranks 25th, that is, next to the highest, in 
ratio of time cost to abilities produced; and, what is even more striking, 
system XXVI, which spends third from the least amount of time, ranks 
third from the highest in abilities and 26th or highest in the ratio of time 
cost to abilities produced. 
That a large amount of time expended is no guarantee of a high stand- 
ard of abilities may again be convincingly seen by comparing the ratios 
of the five systems spending the smallest amount of time with the five 
spending the largest. Of the five spending the least time, the average 
ratio is .80, which corresponds with the 23d or the 3d from the best in 
ratio; and of the five spending the greatest amount of time, the average 
ratio is 1.57, which corresponds with the 4th poorest in ratio. 
The last three tables have each shown the decided lack of relation- 
ship between time cost and abilities produced, and hence for these 
systems it is evident that there is practically no relation between time 
expenditure and arithmetical abilities; and, in view of the representa- 
tive nature of these twenty-six systems, it is probable that this lack of 
relationship is the rule the country over.
-P-A-G-E-279
  Measuring Results in Education 265 
This is not to say that a certain amount of time is not essential to the 
production of arithmetical abilities; nor that, given the same other 
factors, operating equally well, the product will not increase somewhat 
with an increased time expenditure. What is claimed is that, as present 
practice goes, a large amount of time spent on arithmetic is no guarantee 
of a high degree of efficiency. If one were to choose at random among 
the schools with more than the median time given to arithmetic, the 
chances are about equal that he would get a school with an inferior 
product; and conversely, if one were to choose among the schools with 
less than the median time cost, the chances are about equal that he 
would get a school with a superior product in arithmetic.! 
So far, then, as ability in arithmetic means ability to handle such 
foundation work as is measured by the tests in this study, this “essen- 
tial” has not necessarily suffered by the introduction of other subjects 
and the consequent reduction of its time allotment. 
One would need to read the whole study to appreciate fully 
the nature of the investigation. From the pages quoted, how- 
ever, it must be apparent that: (1) schools and school systems 
vary greatly in the results which they secure in arithmetic; 
(2) the excellence of the work done is not directly pro- 
portional to the time expended. We will find it necessary to 
revise our opinions with regard to the organization of school 
subjects, the allotment of time, the methods of teaching, and 
the like, in proportion as we have careful investigation in these 
several fields.

one would get a school with a superior product in education.

II. First Steps in Instruction 
1. MATERIAL. 
1. Material should be (1) interesting, (2) literary, so far as possible, (3) 
adapted to the capacities and tastes of children, (4) of enough difficulty and 
sufficiently above their own ordinary thoughts to have value as instruction. 
2. The best material (x) folk stuff, such as the classic fairy tales, Mother 
267   
 
-P-A-G-E-282
  268 Appendix 
Goose, etc., (2) tales of heroism and sacrifice, (3) poetry of the simpler type, 
like that of Stevenson and Christina Rossetti. 
3. Much of the language work should be free conversation between the 
teacher and the children about their ordinary experiences. 
2. METHOD. 
1. During the first years much of the literary material must be given orally 
by the teacher. Oral work is to be held of great importance. 
2. Children to be encouraged to commit good things to memory. 
3. All reading aloud by the pupils to be done as naturally as possible. Im- 
portance of reading by phrases and sentences, rather than word by word. 
4. Value of the dramatic element in early work. 
5. The conflict between the “word method” and the “sentence method” 
over. Modern teaching eclectic in method. If any name can be given to the 
best way, it might be, perhaps, “thought method.” 
6. Use of script and print: advantages of each as a first form. Value of 
printed cards and other devices for drill. 
7. Form of type for beginners’ books: not too large; letters to have all 
differentiating marks distinct. Importance of right kind of paper, width of 
columns, etc. Kinds of pictures most serviceable. 
8. When shall writing begin? In pam not to be forced on the child in 
the first year. Arguments for and against this arrangement. Should there be 
any fixed standard of accomplishment for the first year? | 
9. Phonetic drill. How many words must be known before it begins? 
Various plans equally successful. The main thing, perhaps, is to have drill 
enough to give the pupils certainty in their work, but to keep the drill subordi- 
nated to their interest in reading. 
to. The order of such drill. “Norinal words,” chosen for their meaning, 
their frequency of occurrence, and their similarity in form to other words 
either at their beginning or at their end. Many words, however, must be 
learned without relation to such a scheme. 
tx. “Normal sentences” those that partially help the reader to the recognition 
of words; as, “The sun rises in the east, and sets in the west.” For young 
children, sentences involving the use of repetitive phrases must also be regarded 
as normal, as in “The House that Jack Built.” | 
12. In general, both analysis and synthesis to be used in word drill. 
13. Importance of securing good habits as to intelligent reading, correct 
spelling, etc., in the early years. Children can usually do better than they or 
their elders think they can. | 
14. Emphasis to be placed upon reading many of the good things over and 
over, until they are known in whole and in part.

Ill. The Teaching of Literature 
1. GENERAL PROBLEMS. 
1. Can literature be taught? Or can pupils “be taught through literature” ? 
Examples of such educational use of literature. 
2. Present aims in teaching literature: entertainment, portrayal of life, ac- 
quaintance with the world of thought and feeling as presented in books, culti- 
vation of imagination and sense of beauty. 
3. True interpretation implies grasping the central purpose, idea, or feeling of 
the piece. 
4. Various types of literature demand various treatment. Necessity of adapt- 
ing the treatment to the class. 
5. Taste (sense of beauty) developed mainly by contact with good models. 
Instruction plays a minor part. The love of good reading fostered by judicious 
selection of material, and by example and influence. 
6. How can the habit of good reading be cultivated ? 
2. MATERIAL. 
1. The literature chosen must be suitable in its themes, its action, its feeling, 
its simplicity. 
2. Literary histories and biographies: their limited value in elementary work. 
3- Scientific and historical material in literature. Literary use of such ma- 
terial not to be confounded with science and history. 
4. Pictures and other illustrative material: Sometimes give intuitive basis 
for desired concepts; sometimes interfere with the imagination. 
3. Mertuop. 
1. Reading aloud: its value. Means of securing good results; interest, sense 
of reality, consciousness of an audience. 
2. Analytic study, of content, form, and general literary effects. 
a. Must be adapted to the pupil’s interest and his stage of development. 
b. Must yield results of value appreciable by the pupil. 
c. Effects of too much or too little such study. 
3. Correlation of literature with other work possible in limited degree. A 
matter of class treatment rather than of the general arrangement of the course 
of study. A problem for the teacher rather than the principal. 
4. Treatment of allusions, historical, literary, etc. The need of judicious 
selection. 
5. Treatment of figures of speech, verse forms, new words, etc. 
6. Lesson plans: their function and value. 
a. An outline should control and direct the work, yet be flexible enough 
to allow freedom on the part of teacher and pupil. 
6. Introductions: their nature and function. When necessary.

2. ELEMENTS INVOLVED IN THE PROBLEM: Form AND SUBJECT MATTER. 
1. Importance of subject matter in giving motive and interest, and in deter- 
mining form. 
2. Subjects for composition to include topics from school work and from 
daily life: to be made real, as far as possible. Reality dependent upon interest 
and the consciousness of an audience. 
3- Preparation for the work. Importance of oral treatment, of the gathering 
and ordering of facts and ideas. Originality not to be expected. 
4. Composition units: necessity of training in both sentence and paragraph. 
Value of outlines, and of drill in sentences.

Il. The Persons involved in School Geography Teaching 
1. Tae Duties or THE ScrentIFIC GEOGRAPHER. 
A. Should help make content sound geographically. 
He should be source of geography materials. 
B. Should ascertain that work will insure good training in elements of 
geography. Adapted to pupils and valuable as foundation for good later work. 
C. Should outline method in large so as to produce geographic progress. 
D. Should assist in substituting good for bad details and help choose be- 
tween essentials and non-essentials. 
2. THE OBLIGATIONS OF THE SUPERVISOR OR SUPERINTENDENT. 
A. Must recognize goal to be reached from standpoint of good geography, 
and relations of school geography to other phases of geographic education. 
B. Should accept materials and larger plan of geographer. 
Arrange time of schedule. 
C. Should see that children’s general training is not sacrificed and pecal 
training is secured. 
D. Should insure that work is practical and usable. 
E. Must see that relations to other subjects are emphasized. 
Causal notion again. 
3. THE OBLIGATIONS AND OPPORTUNITIES OF THE TEACHER. 
A. Must know more subject matter than he expects to give pupils. 
B. Must know purposes and scope of course — his part in course as a whole. 
Also must know preparation furnished by earlier year’s work. 
C. Must know relations to other work in the curriculum as a whole and in 
Zeography particularly. 
D. Must know ways subject must be organized and presented to his grade 
so as best to gain aims desired. 
General and special method. 
4. THE PosITION oF CHILDREN IN REFERENCE TO WoRK. 
 
-P-A-G-E-297
   Appendix 283 
Meaning of “To teach children geography.” 
The preparation that may be expected in different grades. 
Children’s interest in work. 
iene must be trained to work and think. 
Goals are knowledge and power. Importance of rational repetition, 
of reviews and map work. 
REFERENCE: Dodge, Journal of Geography, v, p. 385. The Opportunity of 
the Geographer in Promoting School Geography. BORE 
Ill. The Organization of a Course of Study 
1. Course as A Wuore. 
A. Must be capable of being judged as good by geographers. 
B. Must lead to knowledge and power. 
C. Must be arranged so as to lead from known to unknown along lines of 
least resistance but not least effort. 
Method of approach of mature mind must not always be followed. 
Some FUNDAMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS. 
No one course available for all localities. 
Course should start with home geography. 
Should lead next to elementary knowledge of world whole. 
The emphasis to be given to continental work. 
Division of work by grades. 
Disadvantages of teaching all continents twice. 
The following compromise is suggested as in general workable: 
a. Twice: North America, United States, Europe, and perhaps portions 
of Asia. 
b. Once: Asia, Africa, Australia, and South America. 
Present importance of South America. 
F. Plan of intermediate work should differ from plan of upper grades. 
“Concentric Circles.” 
G. The place of physical geography in the course of study: 
a. Home geography: observational side. 
Danger of overemphasis, of giving wrong outlook. 
6. Intermediate grades: give setting to life side. 
Larger facts only. 
c. Upper grade: basis of work. 
Not to be taught as a topic by itself but as a means to an end. 
H. Emphasis of industries and commercial side. 
I. “Following interests of children,” — best meaning of phrase. Value 
and dangers. 
Recent interest in industrial education places a renewed obligation on 
geography to be practical and to be free from fads. 
Developing interest. Temporary and permanent interests. Bh DABEYS

IV. Home Geography and World Whole 
i, CERTAIN GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS. 
A. Home geography not a subject or a division of geography, but a method 
of approach to field as a whole, — cannot have a uniform course for all places. 
B. Method of procedure must be from known to unknown through analysis 
of experiences of pupils. 
C. Work should not call for knowledge of distant places.

F. Definitions, if any, to be summaries at close of developed points and not 
points of departure. 
G. Units developed to be good geography units which may be used as basis 
for comparison over world. Heat, storms, woods, for instance, are not good 
units. Crossroads or city corners good units. 
H. Local history to be brought in as much as possible. 
Should be intimately related to geography and may often be point of 
departure. 
I. Importance of observation of local conditions. 
Reasons for giving a certain place to processes of earth change.

V. The Point of View and Method of Approach in Intermediate Work 
1. PURPOSES. 
Knowledge of more important Continents and Countries, lives of people and 
reasons therefor. 
A. Knowledge of facts of everyday life. Consequences to causes, — phys- 
ical features in the large as points of departure for giving setting. Follow politi- 
cal divisions because of practical advantage.

A. What isatype? ‘A type is that individual of a species or genus which 
contains the largest number of features which are characteristic of the species 
or genus as a whole.” 
B. Types must be good geographic units, and not mere instances, The essen- 
tials of a good geographic unit. 
C. A typical instance is not : 
a. The most involved or striking example. 
6. The most interesting example. 
D. Why types cannot easily be selected in geography. Advantages and 
difficulties of using types. 
a. Examples of good types. 
£. Ways in which teaching by types is actually used in various texts and 
courses of study. 
F. Teaching by “types” does not readily lead to the bringing out of political 
features; leads to overmuch detail and overemphasis of non-essentials. 
REFERENCE: McMurry, C. A., Special Method in Geography, chap. ix. 
VI. Industrial and Commercial Geography . 
1. Present Empuasis or INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL GEOGRAPHY. 
A. Reasons for that emphasis: practical and educational. 
B. Industrial geography deals with the geography underlying the principal 
human occupations: that is, the reason for the occurrence of industries in given 
localities. 
C. Commercial geography deals with the elementary principles of trade and 
commerce, and includes a study of geography of great regions of production 
and demand, with causes. Emphasizes interrelation of commercial areas and 
reasons for same. 
D. Tndustrial geography should be emphasized in intermediate years; com- 
mercial geography in the upper grades. 
£. Industrial geography should include the study of groupings of peoples 
according to occupations and lead up to a knowledge of the simpler reasons 
therefor. These groups are agriculture, grazing, lumbering, mining, manufac- 
turing, commerce, and “scenic centers.” 
F. Geography does not call for study of technique of industries, and should 
not include special study of details of industries. Futility of studying processes. 
Geographic side includes the reasons for industry and not the manner of it. 
Technique is largely result of human invention and is not geographic except pos-
-P-A-G-E-302
  288 Appendix 
sibly where some invention has revolutionized an industry and greatly changed 
relations of peoples to their geographic surroundings. 
G. Geography underlying agriculture, grazing, and lumbering as examples of 
geographic influences. 
#H. Commercial geography should be based on knowledge of industrial and 
physical geography of earlier years, and should be a part of regional geogra- 
phy — not a special topic. It should include study of routes of trade, areas 
of supply and consumption of chief foods, textiles, manufactured products, 
raw materials, etc., and relative status of chief commercial nations, and 
reasons. 
I. Difficulties in teaching commercial geography are due to modernness of 
subject, constant changes involved, lack of illustrative materials and to diffi- 
culties of securing proper materials for class study. 
J. Some recent successes in teaching commercial and industrial geography. 
The development and purposes of commercial museums for schools.

VII. The Basis of Work in the Upper Grades 
1. GroGRAPHY IN UPPER GRADES SHOULD BE FOUNDED ON Goop WorKING 
KNowLepcE oF ELEMENTARY PRINCIPLES OF GEOGRAPHY. 
A. These principles should be elaborated summaries or generalizations of 
earlier work, and should be developed only so fully as is necessary for clearness 
and for future good work. 
B. Physical geography not as an end, but as a means to an end. 
C. Life consequences to be made prominent as illustrations at every 
step. 
2. Tuts WoRK SHOULD INCLUDE : 
A. Earth’s shape — simple proofs and effects. 
B. Earth’s motions — results. 
C. Elements of climate and weather as related to earth’s motions with effects. 
Importance of climate. 
D. Simpler land forms and influence on life. Drainage. 
E. Simpler features of oceans and oceanic movements as related to commerce 
and trade. Tides need not be elaborated 
F. Distribution of plants as related to causes, especially climate. 
G. Distribution of animals as related to causes. This topic should be treated 
briefly. 
H. Races of men and their distribution as related to climate and food 
supply. 
I. Elements of commerce causally developed. 
J. Elements of political geography — including meaning of nation, of boun- 
dary, origin of boundaries, exchange of consuls, ministers, etc. 
3. Topics WHICH MAY BE OMITTED : 
A. Causes of tides.
-P-A-G-E-303
  Appendix 289 
B. Condition of interior of earth. 
C. Causes of mountain growth. 
D. Details of glaciation. 
E. Geological development of continent. 
4. Mernop In LarceE. 
A. Work should be developed, as far as possible, as result of map work and 
personal observations. 
B. Principles should be illustrated as widely as possible to show general im- 
portance. 
C. Some topics may readily be studied in association with study of Africa or 
Australia, and thus training may be given in working from causes to conse- 
quences, as preliminary to later use of definite causal order. 
REFERENCE: Redway, New Basis of Geography, chap. viii. 
VIII. The Topical Method in Upper Grades 
1. GENERAL AGREEMENT IN REFERENCE TO TEACHING CONTINENTS IN UPPER 
GRADES FROM CAUSES TO CONSEQUENCES. 
A. Principles should be used as basis of work. 
B. Work should be largely based on map study, especially maps of climate, 
physical features, distribution of trade routes, peoples, industries, etc. 
C. Work should not be too stereotyped, — that is, order of procedure should 
not always be the same. 
D. Training should be given in reasoning and in use of reference books, texts, 
atlases, etc. e 
E. Topical method means to work from larger, simple, general features, out 
to more detailed, special and complex conditions. Possible modifications and 
advantages. Using an imaginary continent.

IX. The Use of Maps and Textbooks 
1. ADVANTAGES OF A TEXT: 
A. Outlines a course of study when none better is available. 
B. Gives clear definitions and summaries. 
C. Gives second exposition of subject matter of value to pupils who gain 
best impression through the eyes. 
D. Shows relative values of different parts of subject. 
£. Furnishes text, maps, and illustrations for study. 
F. Gives chance for training in how to study. 
G. Gives means of holding children responsible for certain work.
-P-A-G-E-305
  Appendix 291 
2. How To use Text: 
A. Text should be servant of teacher, and not the teacher a slave of text. 
B. Text used before recitation in association with outline or series of map 
questions where nature of materials or other conditions do not permit develop- 
ment. Advantages of assigning lessons in certain grades. 
C. Text used in recitation to give training in how to study in intermediate 
grades. 
D. Text used after recitation as means of summary and review in much ot 
home geography and in certain parts of upper grade work. Teachers here 
use materials of book as “texts” or points of departure. 
3- THe Use oF Maps. 
A. Maps fundamental in geography. 
B. Maps only clear and accurate means of representing certain classes of 
facts. Examples of such facts. 
C. Essential points to be kept in mind in map use. 
a. Cardinal directions indicated by meridians and parallels. 
6. Top of map is not necessarily north. 
c. Scale is necessary for getting ideas of distance and area. 
d, Each map has special symbols adapted to special purpose of map. 
e. First maps studied should be maps of local region shown in a horizon- 
tal position and properly oriented. 
D. Maps of most service in texts and classroom: 
a. Political maps in all grades. 
6. Physical maps of large areas only give relative conditions. Cannot 
give exact representation of country. Dangers in physical and relief 
maps. 
c. Climatic maps: annual, seasonal, special. Winds and heat belts. 
d. Vegetation maps in upper grades. 
e. Product and commercial maps as related to vegetation, climate, and 
surface.

X. The Relation of Geography to Other Subjects in Curriculum 
I. PLACE OF GEOGRAPHY. 
A. Geography is considered by some as fundamental subject in curriculum, 
as it gives basis for study of human activities. 
B. Geography is rather an important subject to be studied in connection 
with other subjects so as to produce best results from curriculum as a whole. 
C. Codperation between subjects does not mean parallelism in teaching or 
disorganization on one subject because of temporary possible cross relations 
to other subjects. 
D. Unity of course of study as whole in any subject of more value than tem- 
porary mutual relations between subjects. 
   
-P-A-G-E-306
  292 Appendix 
E. Geography closely related, in many ways, to nature study, history, 
language, and arithmetic. 
F. Geography may contribute to and receive help from industrial sub- 
jects. 
2. GEOGRAPHY AND Nature Stupy. 
A. Simpler elements of geography should be included sanely in nature 
study of Grades I, II, and III. 
B. Geography in Grade III and perhaps IV should be based on nature 
study of earlier years. Simpler aspects of home geography should be taught 
before Grade ITI. 
C. Geography contributes to nature study knowledge of conditions influ- 
encing distribution of plants and animals, elements of weather, soils, slopes, 
drainage, simple land forms, distance, and other conditions affecting problems 
of food, clothing, and shelter. 
D. Geography gives application to nature study in upper grades, summar- 
izes distribution of animals and plants, and gives regional basis to nature 
study. 
E. Nature study Loudatutes to geography knowledge of plants and animals 
and their ecological relations, physics and chemistry of soils, water, etc., as 
related to agriculture, grazing, and lumbering. 
F. Topics of doubtful value in nature study or elementary geography. 
a. Formation of coal, marble, and rocks, and similar topics. 
6. Minerals, except in localities where minerals may be found. 
c. Earth’s motions and similar large topics which cannot be studied 
through observation. 
GroGRAPHY IN Its RELATION TO History. 
. Geography finds its best applications in history. 
. Geographic influences vs. geographic controls in history. 
Geography deals with the relation between physical environment and 
life in all its phases. History deals with the interpretation of human move- 
ments. 
D. Hence history finds its basis largely in geography both in reference to 
large facts and smaller details. Examples. 
E. Suggested order of studying geography and history in the different 
grades. History should aid in making political geography understand- 
able. 
4. GEOGRAPHY IN ITS RELATION TO ARITHMETIC. 
A. Problems in area, distance, time, averages, proportion, etc., may well 
be developed through use of facts of geography. 
B. Graphic method of representing comparisons in geography should be 
developed in arithmetic. 
C. Latitude and longitude to be developed in geography and applied in 
arithmetic. 
5. GEOGRAPHY IN ITS RELATION TO LANGUAGE. 
A. Geography finds much of its material in literature and its largest means 
of expression in language. 
B. Geography should pie landscape setting to poetry and prose. Away 
 
-P-A-G-E-307

C. The study of literature should include material which is geographically 
sound. 
D. Much geography is not expressed in good literary form, and much lit- 
erature is geographically unsound.

XI. Geography and Expression Work 
1, EXPRESSION. 
A. Chief and most important forms of expression are oral and written 
expression. 
B. Danger and unfairness of considering expression work to be merely 
handwork. 
2. Cater WAYs IN wHIcH HANDWORK CAN BE USED IN GEOGRAPHY. 
Through map drawing, map filling, sand or chalk modeling, and freehand 
drawing. 
A. Modeling: 
a. A means to an end of value if done skillfully and easily. 
b. Dangers in representing scale and slopes. 
c. Should involve small area as to details or merely general features 
of a large area. First work in modeling should be devoted to 
features that children may observe as wholes. 
B. Map Drawing: 
a. Too time-consuming as a rule. 
6. Difficulties of projection and scale. 
c. Over-refined product should not be called for. 
d. Children’s maps are a bad basis for visualization. 
C. Map Filling: 
a. Makes use of best base map available and same base map for all. 
6. Excellent means of review as test of knowledge gained. 
c. Relative value of flat and relief outline maps. 
D. Freehand Drawing: 
a. An accessory to geography work, not a way of making confused objects 
or relations clear. 
b. Value of slope sketching, of simple landscape work, and of map color- 
ing. 
c. Hand work may borrow ideas and details from geography but adds 
littie to value of geography as a subject.

XII. Equipment in Geography Teaching 
1. Necessity oF EQuipMENt. 
Maps, globes, and illustrations. Costly single pieces of apparatus to be 
avoided. | 
A. Maps: | 
a. Every schoolroom should contain the following wall maps: 
(1) Mercator map of world. (2) Map of North America or United 
States. (3) Map of continents to be studied. ; 
6. Maps should be chosen for demonstration and recitation work and 
not for study. 
c. Hence should be clear, capable of being seen across the room, not 
overcrowded with details: rivers and cities not overemphasized. 
. Upper grades should have physical map of United States and Europe 
for use in history and geography. 
The use of United States Geological Survey Topographic Maps. 
Use and means of securing weather maps. 
Blackboard outline maps, — value and use. 
. Difficulties of securing certain much desired wall maps. 
lobes : 
One 10 or 12 inch political globe available in every room. 
Globe to be of a size to be easily handled. 
Political globe should be up-to-date; not overcrowded. 
. Blackboard globes, — how used. 
Small physical or political globes for individual use. 
f. The use of relief globes. 
C. Apparatus: 
a. Avoid large pieces and geographical diagrams. 
b. Standard thermometer, barometer, compass, and wind vane to be 
available. 
c. Special pieces available for special purposes. 
D. Illustrations : 
a. Includes photographs, cuts from magazines, slides, stereoscopic 
views. 
b. Necessity of scheme for selection, classification, and storage of mate- 
rials. 
c. Value of a few good illustrations as compared with a host of poor 
illustrations. 
d. Relative advantages of pictures, slides and stereoscope for special 
purposes. 
e. Mechanical difficulties incident to class use of illustrations.

XIII. The Geographic Preparation of a Teacher of Geography 
It is neither possible nor desirable to have every grade school teacher a 
specialist in geography. 
A. The scope of work analyzed. 
a. Larger portion of work will be the geography of continents in earlier or 
later grades. 
6. Small portion of work will be development of principles of physical and 
life geography. 
c. The principles will be expected to be used in continental work. 
B. The requisite training of a teacher must then include: 
a. Some study of larger principles so as to make these principles usable in 
all grades. 
b. Special study of one or more continents so as to give point of view and 
method of studying a region causally. 
c. Training in use of maps, especially atlas and text maps, weather maps 
and United States Geological Survey Topographic Maps. 
d. Knowledge of larger principles underlying geography teaching in the 
grades and study of special difficulties in each phase of elementary school work. 
Knowledge of subject matter is an essential basis for study of methods of 
teaching. 
e. These requisites suggest the necessary content and order of procedure in 
geography courses in training classes. 
C. Desirable training that teachers should be encouraged to secure. 
a. Knowledge of geography beyond the minimum outlined above and suffi- 
cient to make them independent workers and possibly investigators in some 
phase of geography. 
6. Good knowledge of history of United States and Europe. 
c. Knowledge of elements of anthropology, economics, and biology, par- 
ticularly along ecological lines. 
d. Knowledge of modern industrial problems in the United States, particu- 
larly along lines of agriculture, manufacturing, commerce, and conservation of 
forests and water supply. 
D. Opportunities for securing training in geography. 
a. Larger and better normal schools and many colleges and universities now 
include well planned courses in geography. 
6. Teachers in service will find splendid opportunities for geography work 
at the summer schools of colleges and normal schools. Also in some cases in 
certain phases of the subject, work may be secured in extension and corre- 
spondence courses. 
c. Teachers seeking summer school opportunities should go to institutions 
that have summer terms, and not, as a rule, merely to summer institutions. 
Geography cannot be adequately taught without equipment, and only those in- 
stitutions which are in operation the year round can have adequate equipment.

Iv. THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
By Henry Jounson, A.M. 
I. What History is 
1. Tae Worp “History” MAY DENOTE: 
. Past facts themselves. 
Traces left by past facts. 
The study which investigates such traces. 
The knowledge thus obtained. 
An account or narrative in which such knowledge is embodied. 
Tue Sources or HistortcaL KNOWLEDGE. 
. Primary sources. 
1. Material remains — roads, buildings, tools, weapons, clothing, any 
material object shaped by man or associated with his life on the 
earth. 
2. Reports of conditions and events made by actual observers. Such 
reports may be oral, written or printed, pictorial. 
6. Secondary sources — reports or accounts based upon primary sources. 
c. Accounts based upon other accounts in varying degrees of removal even 
from secondary sources. 
d. Existing sources relate to fragments only of man’s total experience in the 
world. 
3. HistorrcaL Criricism—THE FOUNDATION FOR THE DETERMINATION 
or ParTICULAR FACTS RELATING TO THE Past. 
a. External criticism — investigation of the origin and transmission of 
sources; a study of form, language, writing. Is the material remaining 
authentic? Who was the author of the document? What did he say? 
b. Internal criticism — investigation of the content of sources. What did 
the author mean? Are his statements true? 
c. The need of historical criticism finds daily illustration in the schoolroom, 
in ordinary conversation, in the newspapers. 
d. Historical criticism first formally applied by the Greeks. Not fully de- 
veloped until modern times. 
4. HistoricaL SyNTHESIS — PUTTING THE FACTS TOGETHER INTO A Bopy 
OF ORGANIZED KNOWLEDGE. 
a. The chronological order — facts arranged according to time of occur- 
rence. 
6. The geographical order — facts arranged according to place of occurrence. 
. The logical order — facts arranged according to their intrinsic nature. 
. One order used exclusively. 
. History As AN ACCOUNT oR NARRATIVE. 
. The subject embraced. 
1. A single person. 
2. A single people — whole known period or a part of it. 
aypsaneea anas 
 
-P-A-G-E-313
  Appendix 299 
3. The whole world — universal history. 
6. General conceptions of history writing. 
1. A narrative of memorable events. Aim, mainly to please. Content 
determined by taste of authors and their public. Epic poets and 
story-tellers early contributors. Classical type fixed by Herodotus, 
the “father of history.” 
2. A collection of precedents supposed to be useful to statesmen, generals, 
and others. Aim, didactic. Content determined by the kind of 
examples or lessons needed. But these, according to early concep- 
tions, to be valuable must be true to the facts. Facts largely poli- 
tical and military. A conception introduced by Thucydides and 
developed by Polybius. 
3. Scientific history. Aim, to exhibit the past as it was and to explain how 
it came to be what it was. Content determined by what is regarded 
as significant in illustrating the idea of development in human 
affairs. 
c. These general conceptions correspond roughly to stages of human cul- 
ture. 
d. History generally regarded merely as a branch of literature up to 1850. 
e. Side by side with scientific histories, works of the older types are still 
being produced.

II. The Problem of Adapting History to Children 
1. SPECIAL GUIDANCE SOUGHT IN THE “NaTURAL” TaSTES AND INTERESTS 
oF CHILDREN. 
a. These determined by experiment. 
b. Sometimes regarded as a final criterion. 
c. Reinforced by the culture epoch theory. 
d. Conclusion: “The childhood of history for the child, the boyhood of 
history for the boy, the youthhood of history for the youth, the manhood of 
history for the man.” 
e. The conclusion interpreted. 
1. Facts to be selected and arranged according to their cultural stages 
and not according to time or place of occurrence. 
2. Manner of treatment to accord in general with the conception of his- 
tory first developed by the race. 
3. Scientific history thus excluded. 
f. General comment: Important to distinguish between the natural tastes 
and interests of children and the cultivated intelligence of children.
-P-A-G-E-314
300 Appendix 
2. APPROACH FROM THE Sipe or History. 
a. Kinds of historical facts. 
Te Facts relating to physical appearance of men and their material en- 
vironment. 
a. Possibility of direct appeal to the senses. 
b. The simplest illustration of change in the world. 
c. Material aspects of the past sufficiently unlike those of the present 
to be interesting. 
Facts relating to what men did. 
a. Direct sense appeal not applicable. 
6. Only actions now in progress can be observed. 
c. With these as a basis actions in progress in the past more or less 
readily imaged. 
d. That action appeals to children an axiom of history teaching. 
Facts relating to thoughts and feelings of men, the motives that moved 
them to do or to say. 
a. Known only through deeds and words. 
6. Real understanding of the past measured by pupil’s ability to enter 
this inner life of history. 
c. Important to recognize difficulties and limitations. 
d. The mental states of a Clovis, a Charlemagne, a Napoleon, or even 
of a cave-man, an Indian, a pioneer, largely beyond the experience 
of children and of most adults. 
In each of these groups the simplest facts relate to particular objects. 
particular acts, thoughts, feelings. 
Collective facts, facts relating to social groups, to institutions, to gen- 
eral causes that act in history, much more difficult. 
a. How represent a wave of prosperity? a panic? a revolution? 
society itself? 
b. Such expressions made intelligible by resolving them, so far as 
possible, into their concrete elements. 
b. The kinds of facts enumerated common to literary, didactic, and scientific 
history. 
c. Degree of difficulty presented by a given type of facts not essentially dif- 
ferent for different kinds of history. 
d. A principle of grading thus suggested as applicable to one kind of history 
as to another. 
Ze 
a; 
3. 
4. Any facts readily visualized possible material for school history. 
Clear visualization a factor in stimulating interest. 
Clear visualization of the man, the act, the situation, a necessary key 
to his mental states. 
Elementary history, therefore, to be largely descriptive and narrative, 
to be made up of concrete examples rather than generalized knowl- 
edge. 
e. Time and place relations essential to the conception of any fact as histor 
ical. As difficult for one kind of history as for another.
-P-A-G-E-315
  Appendix 301 
j. Special conditions imposed by scientific history. 
1. Facts in palpable conflict with present knowledge not to be regarded 
as historical. 
2. Facts to be characteristic of persons, peoples, places, periods; not 
exceptional, abnormal, bizarre. 
3. Facts to be so presented as to exhibit relations, cause and effect, 
continuity. 
4. Facts to be so presented as to arouse some consciousness of how we 
know what we know about the past and why we do not know 
more. 
5. These conditions quite possible to meet within the limits suggested 
by the principle of grading already set forth.

1. Tue Farra oF Epucators IN THE Utitity or History ATTESTED BY 
PROGRAMS IN THE SUBJECT FOR EVERY GRADE OF INSTRUCTION FROM THE 
KINDERGARTEN TO THE UNIVERSITY. 
2. Current Discussions CONFUSING. 
a. Aims sometimes defined without reference to the nature of history. 
History then repudiated wherever it happens to interfere with “the uses of 
history.” 
6. Aims sometimes inconsistent with each other. 
c. Little to indicate that one of the aims of historical instruction is to teach 
history. 
. AIMS COMMONLY ProposeED. 
Discipline — training of the memory, the imagination, the judgment. 
Culture — “enriching the humanity of the pupil.” 
Inspiration — furnishing ideals of conduct, patriotism, social service. 
Practical knowledge — teaching pupils how to act in the present. 
The illumination of other studies, especially literature and geography. 
The cultivation of a taste for historical reading. PO AD Saw
-P-A-G-E-316

The explanation of the present — nothing in the world to-day really in- 
telligible apart from its history. 
. SPECIAL MoprrN Empuasis UPON THE Social VALUE or History. 
An application of a general point of view in education. 
. Special demands upon history. 
x. Must show in the form of concrete examples what society is and how 
it works. 
2. Must “give a vivid and intense realization of social duties and obliga- 
tions.” 
5. PERTINENT Questions. 
a. Are the aims proposed in fact promoted by a given kind of instruction ? 
b. Are they promoted as effectively as they might be by some other kind of 
instruction ? 
c. Are they the most useful of the possible ends that history might serve?

c. Character of the textbooks. 
Rarely the work of historical experts. 
Aim to tell a story rather than history. 
Accuracy a minor consideration. 
Show little sense of historical proportion. 
Their merit is that children can understand them. 
Some recent books conceived in a more serious spirit and much bettc.” 
as history. 
d. The use of maps, pictures, and other special aids to visualization increasing 
Still much to be desired. 
3. Tue Last Two Years. 
a. Textbook work becomes more formal. 
b. Types of textbook recitations. 
1. “Hearing” the lesson. 
a. Teacher announces the heading of paragraph or opening words ot 
sentence. 
b. Pupil carries the story forward until relieved by “next.” 
c. A test of memory. 
2. The question and answer method. 
a. Teachers’ questions suggest analysis of text. 
6, Short answers by pupil. 
c. Memory test prominent. 
3. A good general plan. 
a. Teacher announces topic. 
6. Pupil tells what he knows about it. 
c. Corrections, additions, and questions by other members of class.

outlines and tempts to generalizations which are largely meaning- 
less to children. 
5. The class recitation thus in danger of becoming an exercise in mere 
words.

VI. The Biographical Approach to History 
i Waat THE BrocrapuicaL METHOD Is. 
a. The study of individual men and women as individuals. 
6. The study of individual men and women as representatives of movements, 
periods, social groups. 
c. The persons selected for study usually great or famous. 
2. REASONS FOR PREVALENCE OF THE METHOD. 
a. Offers units that are simple, concrete, interesting. 
b. Satisfies ethical demands made upon historical instruction. 
c. German experience a potent example. 
d. Supported by “great man theory” of history. 
1. “The history of what man has accomplished in this world is at bottom 
the history of the great men who have worked here.” — CARLYLE. 
2. “Great men sum up and represent humanity.” — RENAN. 
3. Tue Kinps or PERSONS THAT INTEREST CHILDREN. 
a. Men of primitive instincts — cave-men, Indians. 
x
-P-A-G-E-320
  306 Appendix 
b. Men who “did things” — especially brigands, pirates, adventurers, 
generals, kings. 
c. These types fully exploited in books for children. Possibly cause as well 
as effect of children’s tastes. 
d. Relatively few tests of children’s attitude toward scholars, writers, artists. 
4. GENERAL CRITICISM. 
a. Personal element essential to school history. 
b. Events can to some extent be grouped about individuals. 
c. But “great man theory” not well applied. 
1. Persons selected for study often not representative. May be excep- 
tional. Often at best merely picturesque. 
2. Historical characters often distorted for moral ends, 
3- Doubtful anecdotes used to excess. 
d, The “great man theory” not generally accepted by historians. 
e. Individuals often more easily grouped about events than events about 
individuals. 
f. The general tendency of the biographical method is to leave a series of 
disconnected impressions.

VII. The Social and Economic Point of View 
1. Great MEN NOT EXCLUDED, BUT THE “MASSES” INCLUDED. 
2. Empnasis upon SoctaL AND Economic CONDITIONS, — 
Occupations, industries, inventions, commerce, manners and customs, edu- 
cation, amusements, food, dress, upon whatever serves to illustrate the com- 
mon life. 
3. THE Pornt or DEPARTURE. 
a. The daily life and material environment of the community in which the 
school is situated. 
b. The development of some special invention, trade, art, industry, related 
to the immediate neighborhood. 
c. The constructive activities of children — sewing, weaving, cooking, mak- 
ing furniture. 
d. Local history. 
4. APPLICATION To History IN GENERAL. 
a. Limited by the nature of the material available. 
6. Difficult to arrange a connected narrative.

man life at selected stages described, compared, and contrasted. 
5. A GrowING RECOGNITION OF THE GENERAL Point OF VIEW. 
a. Influence of democratic ideals. 
b. Industrial education an important factor in securing change of emphasis.
-P-A-G-E-321
  
Appendix 307

VIII. Making the Past Real 
I. WHERE THE TEXTBOOKS Fatt. 
a, Reading matter usually insufficient for clear images of material aspects 
of the past or for definite impressions of past mental states. 
b. Within certain limits definiteness and simplicity secured by brevity of 
statement. 
c. But the principle of making a thing elementary by not saying much 
about it carried too far. 
d. Stories inherently simple often expanded; those inherently difficult often 
abridged. School history would be more intelligible if the conditions were 
reversed. 
2. SpectaL AIps TO VISUALIZATION. 
. Material remains in vicinity of school. Visits to historic places. 
. Casts, models, pictures, visualization charts, maps. 
The stereoscope, lantern, and other similar apparatus. Moving pictures. 
. Ulustrations‘in textbooks. 
Historical albums. 
. “LIVING THE Past.” 
Exaggerated views illustrated by demand that pupil “identify himself 
completely with the thought, passion and resolution of the time” under con- 
sideration. 
1. Such a demand scarcely met by the most expert historians. 
2. Realism of this type not attainable by children and not even desirable. 
6, Some impression of how men thought and felt essential. 
c. Special aids. 
1. A man’s own words expressed in letters, diaries, personal reminiscences, 
speeches, state papers. 
a, Value varies with character of person and circumstances of utters 
ance. 
6. Words often no clue to real sentiments of author. awe aaoes
-P-A-G-E-322
  308 Appendix 
2. Characteristic stories and anecdotes. 1} 
3- Dramatization of history. 
a. Plays composed by children. May be based on good historical 
material. 
6. Ready-made plays less effective. 
c. Historical pageants. 
d. Historical drama of the professional stage. 
4. Imaginary letters, diaries, speeches, prepared by pupils. Answering 
the questions: “How should I have felt?” ‘What should I 
have said or done?” 
Historical poems and novels. 
a. Value for history easily exaggerated. 
6. A distinction to be made between those that are contemporary 
with scenes represented and those that are merely later attempts 
at reconstruction. 
ce General use in school due in part to tradition which so long made 
history a mere branch of literature, in part to more general 
acquaintance with this kind of material than with material more 
distinctly historical. 
6. Material supplied by detailed histories.

IX. Time and Place Relations 
1. Time Sense IN CHILDREN. \ 
a. Rudimentary at age of entering school. “Yesterday,” “last week,” 
“last month,” have a meaning. “One hundred years ago”’ has not. 
b. The sense develops slowly. Even children of twelve or thirteen often 
measure short periods of time vaguely. 
c. From this an argument advanced against dating any events in distant 
past for children. Can mean only “a long time ago.” 
d. The difficulty in part removec. by objective assistance — chart, rolls, 
knotted cords, and other devices. 
e. Dates properly introduced at least as early as the fifth year. 
2. DATES TO BE REMEMBERED. 
a. Famous events. 
6. Important events. 
c. A few in each year fixed as a permanent possession. 
d. Evidence at present of recovery from extreme reaction against learning 
dates. 
3- Tae Prace RELATION.

Appendix 309 
. The way prepared by geography. 
Maps to be introduced as soon as children have learned to read them. 
Two kinds of historical geography. 
1. Contemporary maps. 
2. Modern maps. 
d. School history should show how events were influenced by geographig 
conditions. Natural features of the earth determine in great part: 
1. Climate, productions, physical development, employments, habits. 
2. Facilities for commerce. 
3. Advantages for military and naval defense or aggression 
4. Intellectual tendencies, but to a less extent. 
e. Place relation to be fixed under same conditions as time reiation.

X. School History and the Historical Method 
1. History ror ScHooL PURPOSES USUALLY TREATED AS A Bopy or AssURED 
KNowLence. 
a. The problem of elementary instruction held to be interpretation and net 
criticism. 
b. Controversial matters omitted so far as possible. 
Little to indicate varying degrees of probability in historical facts. 
Uncertainties covered by dogmatism of textbooks. 
. RAISING THE QUESTION oF How WE KNOW. 
Makes for more intelligent view of history. 
Often adds to interest in the subject. 
Affords material for exercise of reasoning power. 
Directly related to everyday problems. 
e. The question usually excluded from elementary history on ground of the 
‘difficulties involved. 
3. A Simple APPROACH SUGGESTED. 
a. When anything has happened we may know about it because: 
x. We were present when it happened — direct observation. 
2. Some one has told us — oral tradition. 
3. We have read about it — written or printed tradition. 
4. We have seen a picture of it — pictorial tradition. 
6. In how many ways may we know 
1. That John was absent from school yesterday ? 
2. That Lincoln delivered an address at Gettysburg in 1863? 
3. That the “Mayflower” crossed the Atlantic in 1620? 
c. Which is the best way to know about a thing that has happened? Is

that way always possible? Why? How do we get most of our knowledge of 
things that have happened ? — 
d. Application to material remains. 
In how many ways may we know abeut 
1. The spelling-books of our grandfathers? 
2. The bows and arrows used by Indians? 
3. The house that George Washington lived in at Mount Vernon? 
4. Some SimpLe ILLusTRATIONS OF PROBLEMS CONNECTED WITH HIsToRI- 
caL Merson. 
a, The story of how the Egyptians found out that they were not the oldest . 
people in the world. Herodotus, Book II, chapter 2.

trarch, p. 28. 
c. The adventures of the manuscript of Bradford’s History of Plymouth 
Plantation. Introduction to edition published by the State of Massachusetts.

XI. Historical Reading for Children 
. BOOKS DESIGNED ESPECIALLY FOR CHILDREN. 
. Principles of grading not well defined. 
Many books needlessly inaccurate. 
Literary style often bad. 
Some unnecessary “writing down” to children. 
Tue Use or STANDARD HisroriEs. 
a. Availability of historical works for school purposes not in inverse ratio 
to size and scientific value. 
1. Treatment of special topics often simpler and more concrete than 
treatment of same topics in textbooks. 
2. Many passages in detailed histories and biographies of special interest 
to children. 
Some of these can be read by children. 
Some can be read to children. 
A factor in cultivating taste for history. 
. Talks about writers of important works stimulate interest in the 
works, 
3- Real obstacles to more general use. 
a. Cost of standard histories.

COST OF HIGHER EDUCATION 
Central in the influences which have directed development during 
the two years is the rising cost of higher education. As one element 
in the educational costs of the Nation, higher education has been sub- 
jected to the restraining influences of compulsory economy. But be- 
cause such a small proportion of the taxpayers participate directly in 
higher educational activities, the colleges and universities have been 
subjected to more criticism, perhaps, than other elements of the 
educational system of the United States. 
The whole series of facts with reference to the cost of higher 
education had, at the opening of the period which this discussion 
covers, been presented to the public and to educators with decided 
emphasis. The income of higher institutions in 1912, excluding 
additions for endowment, was $89,835,787; by 1922 this had increased 
to $272,815,703. This threefold increase in money costs during the 
10-year period, an increase much greater than the increase in popula- 
tion or in the income of the country, caused great concern. 
The most important element in accounting for the increase is the 
growth in teachers’ salaries. This increase during the years of the 
World War and immediately thereafter has been one of the most 
remarkable phenomena in higher education in the United States. 
In small colleges salaries rose from an average of about $1,400 to 
an average of $2,000, in medium-sized institutions from $2,500 to 
$4,000, and in the large institutions from $5,000 to $8,000 or $10,000. 
During the same period the number of students more than doubled. 
In 1912 there were 255,673 students enrolled in the colleges and uni- 
versities; by 1922 the number had become 550,906. Obviously, how- 
ever, doubling the number of students does not fully account for the 
1 
 
-P-A-G-E-6
  2 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1922-1924 
fact that expenditure trebled. Other factors contributed to increased 
cost. 
Research, always an expensive feature of university expenditures, 
became in all fields increasingly a concern of higher educational 
institutions. Every university of any pretensions came to base its 
claims for honor and reputation largely upon extensive programs of 
graduate research. Undergraduate courses at the same time multi- 
plied and were enriched by the addition of a great variety of offer- 
ings which formerly had not been regarded as essential parts of an 
undergraduate course. Technical courses were added, professional 
courses stiffened, and work with direct pre-professional purposes 
emphasized. More students, more research, more varied courses, 
mean more teachers (an increase in staff from 30,034 in 1912 to 49,- 
838 in 1922) ; more buildings, including dormitories, laboratories, and 
classrooms; more equipment; in other words, more money. While 
this educational development was going on, money lost value, or in 
other words price levels increased. 
As a result of all these influences, educational expenditures for 
universities and colleges were of necessity expressed in terms of 
American “big business.” People who had previously concerned 
themselves little about higher education or about any education in 
fact, felt free to criticise and to make suggestions. Adverse comment 
was released which had formerly been held back by the somewhat 
sacrosanct position which higher education had come to enjoy. A 
flood of questions resulted, all tinged with discontent. “Are the 
results obtained in our colleges worth the cost?” “ Are our educational 
institutions giving us, in the character of citizenship which their 
training is supposed to develop, a type of citizen worth paying for?” 
“Do the colleges and universities build up character of a democratic 
kind, or do they develop snobbishness and intellectual aristocracy ?” 
“Are the institutions turning out graduates of such intellectual 
ability, even of such scholarship, as we may expect from what we 
spend upon them?” Business men and others were free in their 
statements that the college graduate came from college with no idea 
of how to work and showing little development of thoroughness and 
application. It was questioned whether the college really met the 
fundamental material needs of students by providing them with a 
means whereby they could earn a better living by reason of their 
college education. All this criticism was general in nature but di- 
rected toward those fundamental things which had in the past been 
accepted as the peculiar functions and contributions of higher 
education. 
Criticism went further. It asked whether those who received the 
benefits of higher education should not pay for what they get. The 
suggestion that free education should not be quite so free struck the 
public institutions supported by taxation and the private institutions 
supported by endowment and free gifts. Response to the financial 
 
-P-A-G-E-7
  ‘ , HIGHER EDUCATION 3 
pressure of the moment may account for such criticism more largely 
than the general theory that society should pay less of the expense 
of higher education, but everywhere the tendency was toward in- 
sistence upon higher tuition and institutional fees. 
The great influx of students, the resulting expense, and discontent 
with the product of the colleges made many ask whether too many 
men were not going to college. President Hopkins, of Dartmouth, 
made the statement in regard to this point which excited the most 
comment and discussion: “'The opportunities for securing an educa- 
tion by way of the college course are definitely a privilege and not 
at all a universal right.” The apparent antidemocratic tone of this 
statement led educators to interpret President Hopkin’s statement to 
mean that there are not too many trained men turned out by the 
colleges, but that too many are in college who can not be there 
profitably. The argument then becomes, “Do not let into college 
those who will not themselves profit in proportion to effort and 
expense, or those who by their presence will slow up the progress 
of others.” In practically no case have college presidents been will- 
ing to subscribe to the belief that the college should care only for 
the exceptional man. 
The nature of college work and its aims have also suffered attack. 
Frequently objection has been made to the cultural motive in Ameri- 
can college education in favor of the vocational. One of the great 
foundations goes so far in a report as to advocate that the cultural 
elements be cared for by the high school and that the college devote 
itself largely to technical, professional, or other vocational training 
and to research work. 
Economic pressure is not sufficient to account for the action taken 
to meet the criticism offered, nor is the criticism released by economic 
conditions adequate ground for explanation of the steps taken to 
improve higher education. College and university administrators 
have not been compelled by economy and criticism to take cognizance 
of defects in the higher educational system. Rather, outside interest 
and suggestion have given them increased opportunity and freedom 
to inaugurate corrective measures which former tradition and con- 
servatism made difficult. These measures and proposals have not, 
for the most part, been generally accepted as final or of universal 
application. They consist in many cases of more or less isolated 
experiments and discussion. Choice of educational proposals and of 
measures for inclusion in this survey is therefore based largely upon 
subjective judgment and not upon standards of practice. 
No question can be raised that the economic situation has led to 
determined efforts to bring about more careful institutional book- 
keeping and budgeting. In the past, and even to a great extent at 
the present time, the higher institutions have known only approxi- 
mately the actual costs of conducting the institution, and have had
-P-A-G-E-8
4 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1922-1924 
even less idea of the distribution of these costs. The Bureau of 
Education has never been able to collect, even from State-supported 
institutions, statistics of expenditures which are comparable in form 
and substance. It is to be hoped that the educational finance in- 
quiry authorized in 1922, in so far as it relates to higher education, 
will result in some further general understanding of college and 
university accounting. 
Notable among contributions to this end is the very careful cost 
system worked out by the University of Illinois in 1921-22 and 
described by the president’s report for that year. The work of the 
board of higher education curricula of the State of Washington is 
already well known. The General Education Board, which had 
previously published material and given assistance upon the budget- 
ing of college and university funds and expenditures, has, as a result 
of increased interest in this subject, recently created a division of 
college and university accounting. Colleges everywhere are rapidly 
adopting intelligent budget methods and learning to handle the busi- 
ness affairs of the institutions in a businesslike way. This is one of 
the most marked tendencies of the biennium, which is directly due to 
increasing costs and financial pressure. 
SELECTIVE PROCESSES 
Partly as a result of increased costs and partly as a result of 
increased interest in testing and grading programs developed from 
Army psychological testing, colleges have during the biennium 
attempted to meet the problem of the great influx of students by 
more careful selective processes, both for admission and for passage 
through the work of the college. These processes range all the way 
from direct limitation of numbers to attempts to score the individual 
characteristics of students with reference to the bearing of these 
characteristics upon suitability for college education. The most 
important methods may be grouped under seven heads: First, arbi- 
trary limitation of the number admitted; second, increased fees; 
third, use of the entrance examination; fourth, enforcement of high 
standards for entrance and institutional accrediting; fifth, grade 
limitations, both for admission and for progress; sixth, scoring of 
personal characteristics; and seventh, psychological testing. Each 
of these will be discussed briefly in turn. 
No attempt has been made to determine all of the institutions that 
have during the biennium placed a direct limitation upon the num- 
ber of students admitted. Harvard placed, in June, 1924, a limit of 
1,000 for its freshman class. Syracuse University during the bi- 
ennium adopted the plan of abolishing scholarships in order to 
maintain a tuition income commensurate with the number of stu-
-P-A-G-E-9
    HIGHER EDUCATION 5 
dents instructed. By this device the university was able to save 
$50,000 annually. 
Limiting enrollment has its reverse side. Arbitrary restriction 
in the number of students whom an institution will receive may 
result, unless careful thought is given to the resources of the institu- 
tion and the work offered, in a unit which is not economic. Over- 
head expense does not vary in exact correspondence to increase or 
reduction of the number of students. An instructor who has a 
small student-hour teaching load costs just as much and the space 
occupied is usually just as great as if he had a load of standard 
efficient size. Furthermore, limitation of numbers results in reduc- 
tion of tuition income, which may make necessary uneconomic re- 
duction of institutional expenditures. In cases where limitations 
have been imposed they have been based upon analysis of the institu- 
tion’s resources and an estimate of its ability to handle certain 
numbers effectively. Such limitations, it is stated, have resulted in 
a changed attitude on the part of those entering college. For the 
idea that the college is a respectable four-year loaf has been sub- 
stituted, in many instances at least, a realization that college 
attendance is a privilege which must be met by a corresponding 
sense of responsibility. 
INCREASE OF FEES 
An obvious device which it-was thought might limit the number of 
applicants for college entrance and the number of those who persist 
through a college course, was increase of student fees. This pro- 
posal was in line with the criticism of higher education that it was 
too free and that students should pay a larger proportion of the 
expense of their education. A study of the fees charged, made by 
the Bureau of Education for the year 1923-24, shows, when compared 
with fees listed in the catalogues of preceding years, that many in- 
stitutions have thus increased the financial load of the student during 
the biennium. However, reduction in the number of students has 
not resulted. Michigan increased the fees in its medical courses, 
but this had little effect upon the number applying for admission. 
The University of Illinois also increased its fees to nonresidents of 
the State, but again this had little effect in reducing the number of 
\ applicants. In general, increase of fees, therefore, has the effect 
of increasing the income of the institution but little effect upon dis- 
couraging attendance. Such increase of income as is derived from 
increase of fees does not necessarily mean greater economy. If the 
number of students admitted increases, costs may increase more 
rapidly than fee income, since in no case has an institution attempted 
to raise its fees to the point where the student pays the entire cost
-P-A-G-E-10
6 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1922-1924 
of his education. No one has as yet determined a fee charge which 
will actually hold applications for admission to any specific number 
for a given institution. | 
ENTRANCE EXAMINATIONS 
Although some institutions, notably those in New England, con- 
tinue to maintain, a direct control over the number of entrants each 
year by means of the entrance examination conducted by the institu- 
tion itself, there seems to be little tendency to take further advantage 
of this device. In the Middle West and West, where the State- 
supported institutions more generally set the pace under the restric- 
tions of a position in the public-school system, there seems little 
tendency to limit numbers or to determine educability by means of 
institutional entrance examinations. It may be questioned whether 
more extensive use of this device y not have a contribution 
to make to the creation of institutions of distinctive character. 
Uniformity is promoted between different institutions through 
standardization carried on by the national and regional accrediting 
associations and through the work of the College Entrance Exami- 
nation Board; there will always be a place for institutions which 
participate in such a uniform system. However, it is probable that 
in the near future institutions which now maintain their position in 
the college world only upon the basis that they conform to the stand- 
ards of accrediting associations may wish to develop educational 
service of distinctive character. They may find the entrance ex- 
amination one means of insuring entrants who will be suited to the 
peculiar character which they wish to impress upon the institution. 
STANDARDS OF ADMISSION AND OF INSTITUTIONAL ACCREDITING 
The work of the regional and national accrediting associations 
tends to bring about uniformity between institutions. During the 
biennium the influence and importance of the regional associations 
have developed to a remarkable degree. The north central associa- 
tion and the southern association now exercise more powerful in- 
fluences upon secondary education and upon the standardization of 
colleges themselves than do any other national forces. In this con- 
nection a resolution of the north central] association, adopted in 1923 , 
and supported by the higher educational representatives in the asso- 
ciation, recommends that the colleges should provide an alternative 
system of entrance by which students who have completed 11 or 12 
units in the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth grades of the senior high 
school. may be admitted with full standing. If this resolution is 
accepted by the member institutions, it will have an important effect 
 
-P-A-G-E-11
  HIGHER EDUCATION 7 
upon the development of the junior-senior high-school system and 
tend to reduce the number of applicants for college entrance who are 
unfit, by providing in these high schools completion courses not 
looking to college entrance. Similar effects in relieving the college 
burden may be expected from the growth of the junior college idea. 
Further discussion of the junior college will be found at another 
point in this review. 
The tendency toward uniformity has been promoted by the adop- 
tion by the American Council of Education of standards for colleges, 
junior colleges, and teacher-training institutions, the two latter 
during the biennium. These standards were published with the 
recommendation that the regional and other accrediting agencies 
adopt them as a basis for accrediting institutions within their special 
fields of influence. Practically all of the regional associations have 
followed this suggestion and adopted the American council’s stand- 
ards or modified them somewhat to meet local necessities. The Asso- 
ciation of American Universities, which had previously operated 
under the standards devised by the Carnegie Foundation, has also 
adopted the standards of the American council and has been given a 
grant by the Carnegie Foundation to enable it to conduct examina- 
tions of institutions for purposes of accrediting. The Catholic Edu- 
cation Association has accepted the standards of the American 
Council of Education, and other denominational educational organi- 
zations have been considering similar or other action looking to 
betterment of standards in church schools under their control or 
influence. The interest of the denominational colleges in the develop- 
ment of higher standards has arisen in part from the influence of 
increased standardization for other institutions and in part because 
the competition for students has been so reduced that they can afford 
to take steps in this direction. 
The American Association of Teachers Colleges also adopted at 
its meeting in Cleveland, in February, 1923, standards for accredit- 
ing teachers colleges and normal schools. These standards have not 
and probably will not be applied to the institutions which were mem- 
bers of the association at the time of this adoption, but new appli- 
eants for membership will be admitted upon the basis of these 
\ standards. No doubt this will have considerable influence upon the re- 
gional associations in their accrediting of teacher-training institutions. 
The Colorado State College adopted in 1923 higher standards in- 
volving more restrictive prescriptions for preceding work, condi- 
tional admission, and most significant, perhaps, omission of credit 
for life experience, teaching of penmanship, training in art and 
music, and other forms of work which do not contribute directly to 
the course offered by the college.
-P-A-G-E-12
  8 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1922-1924 
Paralleling the development of more exact standards for admis- 
sion to college and for admission to the list of institutions which may 
properly be defined as higher educational institutions is the develop- 
ment in the standards for professional work. The American Bar 
Association adopted standards in 1921; and in 1923, the American 
Pharmaceutical Association, the National Association of Boards of 
Pharmacy, and the American Conference of Pharmaceutical Facul- 
ties also established standards for their specific work. 
The University of Michigan determined in 1923-24 to begin in the 
fall of 1926 to require for admission to the school of law three years’ 
work in college and in 1927 four years’ work. This will make the 
law school at Michigan entirely a graduate institution, with the ex- 
ception that students who take the combined letters and law course at 
the university or in other approved colleges may save two years of 
work. In line with the Carnegie Foundation’s studies upon dental 
education, a similar plan is being considered by Michigan for the 
College of Dental Surgery. Columbia’s Teachers College in October, 
1922, adopted for the School of Practical Arts a change in admis- 
sion which requires for admission two years in a college or a technical 
school instead of graduation from high school. This change was 
made necessary by the rapid growth of the School of Practical Arts. 
The tendency is to extend the time preliminary to professional train- 
ing and the time for professional training itself in law, medicine, 
dentistry, pharmacy, teaching, and engineering. 
GRADE LIMITATIONS 
At the same time that it limited its enrollment in the entering class 
to 1,000, Harvard changed its entrance requirements to provide that 
75 per cent must be obtained on the entrance examination and also 
that the boys admitted without examination must in their prepara- 
tory work rank among the highest seventh of boys in the class. The 
University of Illinois requires a grade of 10 per cent better than 
passing in the institution from which the student comes. The 
Kansas State Board of Administration has recommended that the 
plan of admitting graduates of accredited high schools upon an 
automatic basis be abolished. In general, many college executives 
are coming to believe that the selective process upon the basis of 
high rating in the preparatory work results in reduction of the 
number of students who will not profit sufficiently from college work. 
It is a real selective device. 
CHARACTER SCORING 
It seems to have been established by various investigations, notably 
at the University of Minnesota, that failures on the part of fresh-
-P-A-G-E-13
  HIGHER EDUCATION 9 
men are not due so much to lack of ability as to lack of personal 
qualities and characteristics which enable the student to adjust him- 
self to the environment and work of the college. Increased em- 
phasis has been placed, therefore, upon admission to college upon 
the basis of personal qualities, including the physical. Scoring of 
applicants for college entrance upon the basis of personal charac- 
teristics attempts to cover good habits, industry, manners, respect 
for law, perseverance, alertness, competence, vigor, promptness, 
accuracy, participation in activities, and financial condition. The 
University of Chicago, Oberlin, Harvard, Kansas Agricultural 
College, Leland Stanford University, Reed College, Ripon College, 
and Swarthmore all have in a serious way attempted such scoring 
as the basis for admission. The scoring may be a very formal mat- 
ter, conducted upon the basis of a blank furnished to the principal 
or other officer of the secondary school, and may involve in addition 
to such procedure a personal interview between the student and a 
representative of the college authorities. Northwestern University 
plans to undertake such scoring upon an extensive scale. Swarth- 
more, where the plan has been in effect for some time, states that 
the real entrance examination is the personal interview. 
In addition to the service which character scoring renders in secur- 
ing students who are fitted for good college work, the results of such 
personal knowledge of students should aid the institution in render- 
ing careful instructional service. In the past the professors under 
whom students took their work knew little about the high-school 
records of their students, nothing in most cases about the parents and 
home conditions from which the students came, and only so much of 
their mental abilities and tendencies of character as they might derive 
from classroom contact. The personal history and estimate of stu- 
dents, if made available to the instructing staff, should contribute to 
improved college teaching procedure. 
PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS 
Enthusiasts about the possibilities of pyschological tests frequently 
have urged that the psychological test be used as a basis of admission 
to college. So far development in this line seems to be insignificant. 
One investigation, made by the north central association in 1924, 
shows that institutions within its territory were not using mental 
‘ testing for admission to any great extent. The service of psycho- 
logical testing, in so far as it has been accepted, apparently lies in 
other directions, presented in another portion of this discussion. 
FRESHMAN PROBLEMS 
Careful selection of students for admission to college implies that 
the work offered after admission will meet their needs to the fullest
-P-A-G-E-14
  
10 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1922-1924 
possible extent and will give their abilities the greatest possible 
opportunity for development; and that college life outside the hours 
of formal instruction will contribute definitely to the well-being of 
students and will aid directly in their preparation to participate in 
the privileges and obligations of their adult life. 
In the University of Wisconsin by February, 1923, 11 per cent of 
the class entering in the preceding fall had dropped out; in Febru- 
ary 1924, the corresponding figure for the class which entered in the 
fall of 19238 was 13 per cent. In Harvard only 76 per cent of the 
freshmen who registered in September, 1923, were promoted in good 
standing at the end of the freshman year. Lack of ability is the 
least important factor in accounting for such losses; overenthusiasm 
for sports and other extra-curricular activities is perhaps the most 
frequent cause. Leaving the freshman almost entirely to his own 
devices in making his entrance into the official and social life of the 
institution results in homesickness and discouragement or in useless 
effort and dependence upon chance influences. Naturally his fellow 
freshmen and older students give him a one-sided conception of 
college life, a picture made up largely of athletics, social life, and 
extra-curricular employments. The college authorities, the faculty, 
and study, under such conditions, contend upon unequal terms with 
“ activities” in presenting their claims to his time and attention. He 
has little direct personal contact with college officials and official pur- 
poses, and that little is under what he and his fellows regard as 
compulsion. 
Several institutions, following the lead of the University of Maine, 
the University of Rochester, and the Agricultural and Mechanical 
College of Texas, which are pioneers in the movement, have adopted 
the device known as “ freshman week” in order to deal systematically 
with the conditions described. A study made in 1923-24 by Mary 
Frazer Smith, of Wellesley College, shows that 41 institutions have 
adopted this method of orienting freshmen. These institutions re- 
quire that freshmen report in advance of upper classmen for con- 
ferences and lectures, tests, and inspection of the institutional plant. 
Although called quite generally “freshman week,” the actual time 
devoted to freshman orientation may vary from 1 hour to 10 days. 
The purpose is to acquaint the new student with the aims, oppor- 
tunities, and customs of the institution and to secure information, 
by means of psychological or other tests, which will aid in more / 
careful personal educational service during the freshman year and 
thereafter. The plan is so simple, results obtained so excellent, and 
the possibilities for further development so obvious that general 
adoption of the device of freshman week may be looked for among 
institutions which are seriously trying to meet their educational and 
social problems.

SECTIONING CLASSES 
Freshman week affords an opportunity for obtaining information 
which will enable the institution to group students according to their 
abilities, as revealed by previous academic records or by special 
tests. The plan of sectioning classes in this way is developing rather 
rapidly. Eleven institutions, in addition to two now following the 
plan, intend to inaugurate such sectioning in the near future. The 
chief hindrances in the way of satisfactory sectioning are the desire 
of students for specific instructors and schedule difficulties which 
prevent free passage from one section to another in accordance with 
the record made by the student in his college work. 
Those of us who in college were more concerned in choosing the 
men under whom we took our work than in choosing the subjects 
which made up our curriculum sympathize with the student who 
insists upon being permitted to study under a chosen instructor. To 
be sure, freedom of choice leads frequently to the selection of pro- 
fessors who have reputations for giving “snap” courses, but there is 
a sound element in the judgment of students which it may be a mis- 
take to ignore. Frequently students wish to work under good 
teachers. 
If the sectioning plan is to mean anything real, it must involve 
shifting from lower to higher groups as the student develops or 
displays his ability to work with such groups. This is especially 
true in view of the records and tests upon the basis of which section- 
ing is made in the first place. No one seems to have unlimited con- 
fidence in preparatory-school records, in entrance examinations, or in 
the results of psychological testing. 
A study made in the University of Minnesota indicates that the 
newer psychological method of testing is less reliable than high- 
school records in prognosticating future work. Mental testing has 
made enormous strides since the Army tests were applied to so many 
young Americans, and institutions have attempted to make greater 
use of them for such rating of students as is implied in the plan for 
sectioning classes. The results have not been so satisfactory as the 
friends of psychological testing would desire. Toops and Bridges 
assert that, to be valuable, the correlation between test and scholastic 
record must be between 0.70 and 0.80. No such high correlation has 
\ been obtained. Many authorities seem to doubt whether the mental 
tests have a higher predictive value than other criteria. In a study 
made in the public schools it was found that the correlation between 
public school teachers’ ranking and the subsequent work of students 
was 0.70 or above, which is higher than has been obtained to date 
between the mental tests and students’ work.

President Coffman, of the University of Minnesota, makes a state- 
ment which perhaps represents with considerable justice the present 
attitude toward the tests: 
I would not for a minute speak disrespectfully of intelligence testing, but 
those who are the members of this cult have in some instances claimed that, 
by a series of intelligence tests, it is possible for them to determine in a few 
minutes of time what students can profit by a university and even what voca- 
tion they should follow. 
The conclusion stated, somewhat humorously, is that because of 
innate perversity or obstinacy of mind many of us are not entirely 
convinced. The use of psychological tests for purposes of section- 
ing is admitted generally, however, to be of value, even though the 
ability of the test to avoid injustice to the individual is not admitted. 
The test makes no or insufficient allowance for extraordinary ambi- 
tion and industry. Students who would be excluded upon the basis 
of a psychological test, if this were the method of determining admis- 
sion to college, have, under the restricted application of the test to 
sectioning, an opportunity to overcome poor records upon the test 
by means of extra effort. If the test has been wrong in rating them, 
the injustice can be repaired. In general, educators appear to feel 
that the psychological test can not yet be trusted to determine the 
limits of educability and kind of educability, yet its usefulness is 
admitted, even by sober-minded men who are not carried away by 
a new experimental process. 
ORIENTATION COURSES 
  One of the charges brought against colleges and universities is 
that they are overorganized. A multiplicity of schools, of depart- 
ments, and of courses offered are of necessity confusing to the im- 
mature student. He comes from an institution where his work has 
been very largely prescribed and almost altogether carried on under 
the immediate direction of his instructors. When he finds his new 
institution made up of a number of schools which bid more or less 
independently for his patronage, and of an even larger series of 
departments magnifying the worth and importance of their subjects, 
it is a difficult problem for a freshman to understand the relationship 
existing between the bodies of knowledge which these schools and 
departments represent. He is likely to go through college with the 
idea that the department or school which he chooses upon ground of 
initial interest or personal suggestion represents the whole or nearly | 
the whole body of knowledge required of an educated man. 
To overcome the difficulties of the student and to mitigate the 
effects of departmental mindedness, as distinguished in the phrase 
of Dr. R. L. Kelley, from curriculum mindedness, institutions have
-P-A-G-E-17
HIGHER EDUCATION 13; 
followed the lead of Columbia University in offering special orienta- 
tion courses for freshmen. Just as freshman week is intended to 
orient the student in his new administrative and social environment, 
the orientation course is intended to orient him in the fields of knowl- 
edge which are spread before him in the college curricula. The 
orientation course is intended to unify the material of the curricu- 
lum; to constitute what may be called, following the terminology of 
vocational education, a pre-educational course. More specifically, 
it is intended to train the student to think and to introduce him to a 
general survey of the nature of the world and of man. Committee 
G of the American Association of University Professors has issued 
a study of such courses offered by Amherst, Antioch, Brown, Co- 
lumbia, Dartmouth, Johns Hopkins, Leland Stanford, Missouri, 
Princeton, Rutgers, and Williams. 
One institution at least, Reed College, has carried this idea 
further; the college course is intended as an orientation one, 
but orientation in life rather than in college is sought. Of 
course, colleges have always made the claim that this was their 
purpose. Reed seems to have attacked the problem from a somewhat 
fresh’ standpoint and without the restraints of traditional organi- 
zation. The criticism so frequently directed against the colleges, 
that the attitude of instruction is chronological rather than func- 
tional, applies in many cases to the work of the orientation courses. 
Even at Reed, for instance, the first two years of work are directed 
to providing an historical background. This method of approach is 
also the one frequently adopted by the freshmen orientation courses. 
Historical interest usually develops in a student only after a con- 
siderable body of information has been accumulated with no or little 
chronological unification. Desire to unify and coordinate through 
the agency of time or logical classification is a comparatively late 
development. The filing system comes after accumulation of corre- 
spondence. Although it may require a high order of genius to relate 
instruction material to the familiar life of the entering college stu- 
dent, some element of such relationship is always introduced by good 
teachers. In this way only can reality be given to knowledge and 
intellectual attainments. The present orientation courses, excellent 
as they are under the limitations of chronological approach, might 
be greatly strengthened if more systematically and consciously re- 
‘lated to student experience. 
The attitude of college and university administrations indicated 
by class sectioning and orientation courses implies changed methods 
in the later part of the college course. Measures of the kind already 
described are in large part preliminary to meeting other general 
criticisms of college work. It is charged that the colleges do not 
27301°—27——2  
-P-A-G-E-18
14 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1922—1924 
develop a high type of scholarship. The Phi Beta Kappa Society 
of the upper Hudson has been sending out speakers to talk to 
college students about scholarship, since it is maintained that they 
have very little opportunity to hear about scholarship and great 
opportunity to hear about athletics and money-making. It is 
charged that the processes of college are machinelike and that under 
the formal standards set up education tends to become more inter- 
ested in meeting formal standards than in education itself. It is 
asserted that the work of the regional and national standardizing 
agencies contributes to destruction of individual aims and institu- 
tional character. 
In the attempt to meet these and similar criticisms institutions 
have during the biennium considered carefully matters of curriculum 
revision, and watched with interest surveys of special fields of 
instruction such as those conducted by the American Classical 
League, Modern Language Association, and the Society for the 
Promotion of Engineering Education. ‘They have even begun to 
plan to take definite steps toward the development of better college 
teaching. Systems of providing special honors and distinctions to 
induce interest on the part of students in scholarship and in work 
have made considerable growth. More striking, perhaps, than any 
of these attempts is the development of honors courses and the 
tendency to recognize the value of comprehensive examinations. 
Each of these measures is worthy of consideration. Comment upon 
proposals with reference to improvement and economy in graduate 
work will also be discussed before turning to problems of social and 
college life. 
CURRICULUM REVISION 
It seems to be generally accepted that it is the function of the 
college to train the common citizen. If this is true, too much lab- 
oratory work, too much research, too much methodology and tech- 
nique may develop in a college a kind of training which defeats 
the purpose. What the general run of students need is content 
material useful in common life, and instruction whose aim is presen- 
tation of information in a way that will develop intelligence and a 
judicial spirit in matters of ordinary experience. In other words, 
the curriculum should prepare the student to function in the life 
that he will live after he leaves college. Colleges have always main- / 
tained, perhaps, that these were the purposes of their work. The 
most common method which has been adopted to insure a reasonable 
unity and relationship between the several subjects studied by a 
student, and to insure that his course contains all those elements 
which should enter into the educated consciousness of the common 
man, has been the grouping of subjects as a guide for the student
-P-A-G-E-19
HIGHER EDUCATION : 15 
in the construction of his curriculum. Grouping of subjects has 
not been very strictly observed, however, either by students or by 
the colleges, and little functional unification has resulted. It is still 
possible for the student to take chemistry without arriving at an 
understanding of the scientific method. He may still specialize to 
an extent that leaves him after college an uneducated man in the 
sense that his knowledge is unrelated to large areas of human activity 
and interest. 
In this connection several interesting experiments have been made 
which give students or a committee of students an opportunity to 
suggest curriculum changes. In the second semester of 1923 Vassar 
organized a student curriculum committee whose work continued 
in 1924, and its suggestions have been regarded by the faculty as of 
real value. The students of the College of the City of New York 
have worked seriously upon this college administrative problem, and 
their suggestions are of interest in that they appear to indicate that 
students themselves feel the need for simplification, high standards 
of scholarship, and what used to be known as an “ all-round” educa- 
tion. They recommended that extra credits for high marks be 
dropped, that Latin and Greek be reduced to the status of electives, 
that the third-year language requirement for the A. B. degree be 
abolished, that the language requirement for the social science degree 
be increased, that required military training be abolished, and that 
final examinations for “A” students be eliminated. Their sugges- 
tion that the requirements for the bachelor of science degree include 
one year each of psychology, philosophy, English literature, and the 
history of science, indicates that they recognize the undesirability 
of too great specialization. They also recognize the basic place of 
good health in any educational program by the proposal that recrea- 
tion activities be required of upper classmen as well as of lower. 
An important suggestion, which would imply rather thorough- 
going revision of present curriculum practices, is that instruction be 
developed functionally upon the basis of student grouping in accord- 
ance with their dominant interests. The growth of international 
study groups among college students upon a noncredit basis would 
seem to point to a certain degree of utility and practicality in this 
proposal. Voluntary clubs formed to study international relations 
exist in 85 or 90 colleges. The Institute of International Education, 
\ which is largely responsible for this devolopment, has proposed that 
orientation courses in foreign relations be developed as a result of 
this work, but study of this kind is more closely related to the pro- 
posal to develop functional credit courses upon the basis of group 
interest, than to the orientation idea. International relations is but 
one of many subjects of interest to which students in groups of 
 
-P-A-G-E-20
  16 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1922-1924 
considerable size are willing to give time and work. The possible 
value to formulation of college work of such mental initiative on 
the part of students is undoubtedly worthy of further thought, but 
administrative and practical difficulties are so obvious that outside 
the range covered by free electives, colleges will probably find adop- 
tion of the plan inapplicable. 
An outstanding and courageous attempt to free the traditional 
curriculum from some of the old standards has been made by the 
University of Delaware. This plan contemplates that a group of 
junior students shall study a year abroad and receive credit at Dela- 
ware for the work done. France is selected as the place for the first 
experiment. Students, under the direction of a member of the resi- 
dent faculty of the university, leave the United States in July and 
remain until July of the following year. They follow a very in- 
tensive course of language study in France and take up residence at 
one of the French universities. Each student lives while in residence 
in a French family, so that French must be spoken. 
President Hullihen reports that the greatest obstacle to the plan 
has been the credit difficulty. Foreign courses do not exactly corre- 
spond to work in America. It would seem that the careful restric- 
tions placed upon students to insure that they have the benefits of 
real study, real language work, and travel under most advantageous 
conditions for acquisition of knowledge should justify acceptance of 
a year of such work as the equivalent of nine months’ residence in 
an American institution. The fact that this is not the case seems to 
bear out. the charge that interest in units of credit rather than in 
education is one of the characteristics of American colleges and 
universities. 
Delaware has adopted, in addition to careful planning and super- 
vision of the work abroad, two important methods and safeguards 
to avoid criticism which may arise because of the departure from 
the formal traditional standards of American college education. 
Juniors are selected for the experiment in order that the faculty 
will have an opportunity to observe the students when they return 
to the university as seniors. It is proposed also to substitute for 
the foreign examinations an examination of the comprehensive type 
now made familiar and respectable by the development of honors 
courses. 
No doubt the presence in the student body of those who have had .’ 
the privilege of this foreign study will inspire many first or second 
year students to qualify for admission to later foreign-study groups. 
President Hullihen states that the plan has already had a distinct 
effect in providing a direct objective for the students of the Uni- 
yersity of Delaware. Another advantage of the plan which is an-
-P-A-G-E-21
  HIGHER EDUCATION 17 
ticipated is that it will stimulate the teaching of foreign language; 
since, if successful arrangements can be made, similar student groups 
will be taken to other countries of Europe and South America. 
TEACHING METHODS 
Colleges have been as yet little affected by the development of 
educational theory already commonly applied to instruction in the 
elementary and secondary schools. At first sight it would seem 
difficult to account for this fact since these theories have been de- 
veloped in large part by the schools and colleges of education in the 
universities. Familiarity with these theories, however, seems to be 
confined to the professors of education. As a matter of fact the 
college-teaching profession does not rank teaching with research. 
College teachers and college administrators, although both would 
repudiate the attitude, tend to undervalue the man who is more 
greatly concerned about his teaching problems than about his admin- 
istrative or research work. 
No doubt there is a methodology of college teaching. At any 
rate there is a considerable body of knowledge in regard to the tech- 
nique of teaching which is not shared or practiced to any great 
extent by college professors. Graduate students qualify for college 
teaching positions upon the basis of research which is only in the 
slightest degree related to ability to instruct. In fact research work 
of the type which places students upon the list of eligibles for college 
employment is frequently of such nature that it unfits for teaching. 
Perhaps the new Kappa Phi Kappa educational fraternity which 
has for its purpose interesting men students in education may in the 
long run have considerable effect upon the attitude toward teaching 
on the part of the professorial class and lead to greater knowledge 
of college teaching problems. 
Aside from the development of the sabbatical furlough for college 
professors, which has a somewhat attenuated connection with im- 
provement in college teaching, little positive action has been taken 
to make college professors better college teachers. It is true that 
college administrators are pleased when they obtain a good teacher, 
but they have few means of judging the nature of teaching in their 
institutions and even less satisfactory standards for determining the 
, teaching ability of new men whom they employ. In this connection 
‘protest has been made quite frequently during the biennium that as 
soon as an institution gets a professor who establishes a reputation 
for good teaching or leadership in research, he is hired away by 
some other college. Proposals have been made for enforcing con- 
tracts more carefully and for the development of high standards of 
honor as between institutions in the hope that this practice may be 
discouraged. These proposals are in part based upon the belief that
-P-A-G-E-22
  18 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1922-1924 
rooting an instructor in an institution tends to develop better teach- 
ing. Objections to this idea are so obvious that it is hardly necessary 
to mention them. Extreme manifestation of the belief is afforded 
by the college president who appealed to a graduate institution for 
an instructor with a statement to the effect that, although the men 
previously obtained had been good men, they had been hired away 
by other institutions, and that he hopes now to secure some one who 
will stay. Selecticn and retention of professors upon this plan, 
means, of course, that a premium is placed upon the employment 
of mediocre men who do not give promise of developing competition 
for their services. 
SPECIAL HONORS AND DISTINCTIONS 
There is a growing tendency to adopt some plan of providing 
special recognition and distinction for the man who attains a certain 
ranking throughout his college course and for the man who does 
extra work. These plans follow in general the old principle of 
granting the degree cum laude or magna cwm laude. One of the 
most popular recent devices of this kind is based upon what is known 
as the point system. The plan as adopted at the University of 
Michigan provides that for each “A” grade three points shall be 
counted; for each “B” grade two points; “C” grade one point; 
“D” grade no point; and “E” grade a minus point. For gradua- 
tion the same number of points as of credits or hours is required. 
The man whose general average in points is 2.15 or 2.5 is regarded 
as having attained distinction or high distinction, and his name is 
frequently put in the catalogue or commencement program under 
these headings. The point system, of course, insures a kind of re- 
ward for meeting faithfully the ordinary requirements, but does not 
very extensively encourage independent study. When in addition 
honor points are given for extra technical, educational, or special 
courses, the result is merely to add to the number of units of regular 
work without giving the individual an opportunity to do work of a 
' distinctive and personal character. This point plan for rewarding 
industry and high ranking in the work offered implies the least 
disturbance to the present standardized series of processes through 
which a student must pass in order to secure a degree, or it may even 
imply a belief that these processes are the most useful that can be 
devised. : 
Of the same general nature as granting special distinctions to 
students upon the basis of high rating under the regular system is a 
tendency to make more difficult the passage from sophomore to junior 
year or from junior year to the senior. Princeton has undertaken 
to make passage from the sophomore to the junior year somewhat
-P-A-G-E-23
  HIGHER EDUCATION 19 
more difficult, and this is but one of several instances which depend 
upon increased difficulty without material change in the work offered 
or in the methods used, to secure higher scholarship and better 
training. 
HONORS COURSES 
Limiting enrollment, selective processes intended to secure students 
who will profit from training, special orientation courses for fresh- 
men, and maintenance of high course averages all fail to provide 
adequately for the specially gifted student. They all fail to en- 
courage independent initiative and self-directed work to the point 
where the scholarly attitude or the power of independent procedure 
in dealing with new problems is developed. ‘The need is for some 
method which will induce every student, and especially the gifted 
ones, to extend themselves to the limit of their abilities. The old 
methods and courses failed to do this. The commission on faculty 
and student scholarship of the Association of American Colleges in 
1923 reported that, of all the attempts to accomplish these purposes, 
the honors courses developed in this country by Swarthmore is the 
best and most promising. The honors courses as developed by 
Swarthmore and adopted by other institutions, notably Barnard, 
Carleton, and Smith, are based in fact upon the influence of the 
English honors courses made familiar to this country through the 
Rhodes scholarships, Canadian practice, and by closer international 
student relations. The extent of interest in the plan is evidenced by 
the fact that President Aydelotte’s account of the honors courses 
as developed at Swarthmore, published by the National Research 
Council, has been exhausted and a second edition made necessary. 
At Swarthmore the number of honors students has doubled each 
year for three years. No single movement in higher education has 
been given more interest or promises more far-reaching results than 
this. The course as developed implies independent study on the 
part of students, less formal relationships with the faculty, and 
relaxation of attendance upon classes and ordinary class examina- . 
tions. Honors work is confined to the junior and senior years, in 
part because freshmen and sophomores require basic work, which 
in Europe is regarded as secondary. This condition emphasizes 
and no doubt will contribute to more general and practical accept- 
ance of the fact that the first two years of American college work 
belong in the secondary school. The development of the junior 
college will doubtless be hastened through this influence of honors 
courses. 
Two features of the honors courses have made an appeal to insti- 
} _ tutions which have not themselves adopted the plan. Several institu- 
tions have attempted to extend the privilege of voluntary attendance ir 
 
-P-A-G-E-24
20 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1922-1924 
upon classes to students who attain certain ratings. Princeton at- 
tempted in September, 1928, to extend further its plan of voluntary 
~ attendance upon lectures but was compelled to return to its former 
plan because lectures were entirely deserted. This fact may indicate 
that the greater part of the instruction now carried on by the lecture 
method may more easily and quickly be obtained through reading, 
or it may indicate that those who do not rank high in regular work 
have not the maturity and development to understand how to manage 
their own educational progress. Another element of the honors 
system which makes decided appeal is the comprehensive examina- 
tion. The honors students at Swarthmore are tested by comprehen- 
sive examinations which emphasize the general subject and therefore 
tend to decrease the importance of the individual course. At Swarth- 
more these examinations are conducted by men familiar with the 
fields, who are brought in from outside the institution. A knowledge 
of the field rather than of the specific courses taken is thus insured. 
In a sense those who are directing honors work are thus judged along 
with the students whose work they control. Reed College uses the 
comprehensive examination at the end of the junior year. Its work 
is so organized that such an examination is applicable. At Swarth- 
more the students in the senior class have petitioned that their final 
examinations be of the comprehensive type. In the opinion of 
friends of the comprehensive examination this desire on the part of 
the seniors is regarded as an indication of high educational and 
intellectual interest. Persons who are not converted to the com- 
prehensive examination contend that ability to organize and pre- 
sent information in a clear and logical manner, which is the main 
purpose of the comprehensive examination, may be tested just as 
thoroughly by the ordinary course examination and that in addition 
the latter tests knowledge and memory of course work. The discus- 
sion is valuable in that it is securing much needed attention to the 
technique of examinations in America. 
GRADUATE WORK 
The United States has developed a large number of great univer- 
sities which are famous for their research work. Through a some- 
what curious misapprehension of educational purposes, research and ; 
greatness have therefore become somewhat confused. Research no 
doubt is an important means of testing the standing and reputation 
of a university, but this basis of judgment is carried to an extreme 
point when it leads practically every university in the United States 
to base its claims to recognition upon extensive and varied programs 
of graduate research work. The fact that eligibility for college 
 
-P-A-G-E-25
  
HIGHER EDUCATION 21 
employment depends so largely upon research has contributed to this 
attitude. The results have not been entirely happy. 
During and following the World War the demand for college in- 
structors exceeded the supply. Colleges still demanded, however, 
that their instructors hold higher degrees. As a result, pressure 
upon graduate institutions to meet this demand aided in the promo- 
tion of the already existing tendency to carry over into graduate 
research work the prevailing undergraduate conception that educa- 
tion consists of completion of courses and compilation of units. It 
is asserted quite frequently that graduate work is now on the basis 
of what the graduate student is admitted from and not upon the 
basis of what he is admitted to. In other words, research is in some 
of our graduate departments defined largely in terms of under- 
graduate college education. As someone has expressed it, present 
graduate work “ coddles immaturity.” Professor Woodbridge states 
the case: “ Graduate work should not prepare students for advanced 
degrees but should give them a chance to do something worthy of a 
degree.” 
Tf it is admitted that this situation is justly pictured, it is obvious 
that considerable reduction may profitably be made in the extent 
of graduate research work for degrees now carried on in a large 
number of our universities. It can not be stated too emphatically 
that this does not imply in the slightest that the value and importance 
of real research have been exaggerated. On the contrary, it is a plea 
for extending and raising the standards of research which lead to the 
higher degrees. 
Two proposals have been made recently looking to improvement of 
the situation with reference to graduate work: First, that institu- 
tions specialize in the kind of graduate work to which they devote 
their resources, thus insuring, in so far as educational expenditures 
serve to direct research activity, concentration of energy and ability 
upon limited fields. Beyond question money alone, even money com- 
bined with the assembly of large bodies of graduate students, does 
not provide all the conditions necessary for successful prosecution 
of highly specialized research. It is thought, however, that special- 
ization as between institutions will attract to each institution leaders 
of research who will find in the combination of their work and efforts 
and in the special facilities provided a happy ground for work of the 
‘highest type. A second suggestion made, which is in no way con- 
tradictory to the first, is that a greater degree of cooperation in re- 
search work as between higher institutions be developed. Several 
examples of such cooperative research during the period are of 
special note. The Modern Language Association Research, for in- 
stance, in which 35 research groups are cooperating, is pointed to as 
a conclusive argument for such procedure. Cooperation in research
-P-A-G-E-26
  
  
  22 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1922-1924 
in the humanities similar to that carried on by the National Research 
Council in the scientific field might serve to prevent waste and might 
promote coordinated effort. While not strictly graduate coopera- 
tion, the arrangement of the schools of commerce and business in 
the Universities of Illinois, Indiana, Minnesota, Nebraska, Ohio 
State, Wisconsin, and Chicago to publish the University Journal of 
Business in cooperation is an indication that cooperative effort in 
educational enterprises tends to gain ground. 
SOCIAL AND COLLEGE LIFE 
Much discussion of the work of the colleges and unjversities of 
the United States is centered about the activities which are not 
directly under the control of the college authorities and arises from 
discontent with the institutional efforts to give the individual student 
proper living guidance at those times when he is not in the class- 
room. These problems, always matters of concern to university 
administrators, have been emphasized by current criticism. The 
institutions have felt an increasing need to take positive action look- 
ing to personal advice and guidance for students in their numerous 
academic, social, and financial relations. The feeling has developed 
that the housing, health, and morals of students are matters to which 
administrative authority may properly devote more attention. The 
question is raised whether even the activities directed by students 
themselves may not be brought into closer relationship with the 
institutional and educational aims of the college. The charge that 
the higher institution is an isolated island in the midst of the activi- 
ties of the world has led to increasing interest in the establishment 
of outside contacts. 
The outside estimate of the tone of our large universities is per- 
haps best reflected in the bequest in the will of Willard D. Straight, 
which left to Cornell a sum of money to be devoted to making the 
institution “a more human place.” This problem is not confined to 
the larger institutions. The president of the University of Illinois 
in his report for 1922-23 indeed makes a strong case for the larger 
institution in this respect. He points out that an institution with 
ten thousand students and a staff of one thousand encourages per- 
sonal relationships to as great an extent at least as is the case in the 
smaller college. A larger choice of personal contacts is possible. 
However this may be, the universities and colleges are recognizing 
increasingly the necessity for setting up some agency whose busi- 
ness it is to look after these personal problems. In many institutions 
this agency is the dean of students. In others personnel bureaus have 
been established which serve both the needs of the student and of 
the administrative requirements of the institution itself. 
A
-P-A-G-E-27
  HIGHER EDUCATION 23 
The position of dean of students may be almost indefinitely sub- 
divided. It is recognized that a dean of men may contribute almost 
as much to the life and education outside college walls as the dean of 
women contributes to the well-being of the girls. The dean of fresh- 
men is an office which, under the dean of students, devotes itself to 
the problems of new students. In the University of Illinois a special 
position was created in 1923 to look after student activities and 
organizations. The dean of women frequently encourages group- 
ing of women in organizations, as is the case in Illinois. 
Frequently the dean manages the employment bureau, is a member 
or chairman of the student loan committee, gives vocational and 
educational guidance, advises with reference to and participates in 
student social activities. The dean helps the individual with per- 
sonal, friendly advice, straightens out relations with townsfolk, looks 
after sick students, and establishes contact with parents. He has 
largely ceased to be regarded as the college official disciplinary agent ; 
he is the college friendship man. 
The housing problem in smaller institutions, as well as in the larger 
ones, presents many problems. The development of dormitories for 
women especially enables the institution to exercise a certain degree 
of supervision over the unscheduled hours of the student. Training 
in the social conventions in college dormitories and dining halls is 
carried on by means of example or even definite regulation by cul- 
tured supervisors. When students live in town, scattered through 
rooming houses, supervision becomes a difficult matter. Careful 
supervision of such houses for women is common, but the expense 
seems to be too great to exercise any large degree of control over the 
places where the men live. This problem is being met* by building 
dormitories, but requires further attention by institutions which can 
not hope to house their own students in the near future. 
Athletics present troublesome problems to the college adminis- 
trator who is interested in the well-being of his students and has 
caused much comment and concern outside college walls. The ath- 
letic situation is greatly complicated by the fact that athletics has 
become a matter of large money transactions. In Michigan in 1922 
the revenues from athletics were $226,465.15, while the expenditures 
were $182,909.08. In 1923 the revenue had grown to $309,107.11 and 
expenditures to $190,300.23. In Princeton in 1923-24 the revenue 
exceeded that of 1922-23 by $53,063.80, while at the same time 
operating expenses decreased $57,032.07. The size of these opera- 
tions has emphasized the need of mature control of financial matters. 
Young boys, even young men who are supposed to be receiving a 
college education, should not be called upon to transact business of 
such magnitude. The effect upon athletics is to make public spec- 
tacles of intercollegiate contests, even though it is true that the
-P-A-G-E-28
  24 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1922-1924 
tickets for the big games are taken largely by alumni and students. 
The tendency is to carry on contests with institutions that result in 
large gate receipts and to develop coaches and teams who will be 
winners. i 
The Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools in the South- 
ern States in 1921 appointed a committee of five to inquire into these 
conditions and into the administration of athletics in member col- 
leges.. The inquiry deals with the entrance of athletes to college, 
their record in college, their past athletic records, with absences from 
college during the athletic season, with the salary of the coach and by 
whom paid. The results of this inquiry indicate the need for more 
effective faculty control, the necessity for reducing salaries of 
coaches to reasonable limits, and as a corollary the desirability of 
eliminating the seasonal coaches. The report also advocates the 
elimination of special students from athletics, the eradication of 
scouting, and the encouragement of intramural athletics. Condem- 
nation of long trips and of gambling in connection with college 
athletics is emphatic. 
The report in 1921 of the committee of the American Physical 
Education Association indicates some facts with reference to control 
of college athletics that are worth recording. Thirty-two per cent of 
the 250 colleges of which inquiry was made place management in 
the hands of the faculty; in 80 per cent management is in 
the hands of the faculty and students; in 25 per cent students and 
alumni share the control; in 13 per cent students control. There is 
a growing tendency to place the management of athletics in the hands 
of the department of physical education. The figures above indicate, 
however, that there may be some truth in the charge that in certain 
instances college authorities look to college athletics to create college 
unity and publicity. The charge is that this attitude accounts for 
the fact that, in spite of well-known abuses, little is done to correct 
them. 
Much of the discussion centers about the position of the coach. 
Coaches themselves maintain that high salaries are necessary, since 
their period of usefulness is short and they have little certainty of 
tenure. They maintain that college authorities insist upon their 
_producing winning teams and base tenure upon ability to do so. 
They are not left free to handle the athletic situation as a part of a 
physical development program. The proposal that coaches’ salaries 
be reduced to a point where they compare not too favorably with thc 
salaries of full professors will depend for its successful operation 
upon support from the college authorities. Abolition of professional | 
college coaches and substitution of faculty coaches in their place has 
received great impetus from its approval by representatives of 12 
New York and New England colleges in 1922. This plan has been 
 
-P-A-G-E-29
  HIGHER EDUCATION 25 
adopted by Union, Wesleyan, Bates, Trinity, and Hamilton, and 
submitted for consideration to Amherst, Bowdoin, Middlebury, 
Tufts, Williams, and Colby. The problem of raising the tone of 
college coaching is also being met by the special courses for coaches 
offered by various institutions. The University of Minnesota offered 
in 1924 a complete course of training for teachers of physical educa- 
tion, including coaches, which will lead to the degree of bachelor of 
science in the college of education. The State Teachers College at 
Cedar Falls, Iowa, will offer also a four-year course for athletic 
coaches. 
The contention that it is impossible for the college to develop in- 
tramural sports in those lines which are carried on in intercollegiate 
athletics has been disproved conclusively. At Princeton, to take 
but one instance, 1,215 of its 2,000 students were in 1924 members 
of intercollegiate sports squads. ‘This did not include those who par- 
ticipated in intramural athletics; if this number were included, 90 per 
cent of the students of Princeton participated in some form of sport. 
Careful supervision and determined efforts to bring about an athletic 
situation which would really contribute to the physical and moral 
welfare of the students account for such development. The Uni- 
yersities of Illinois, North Carolina, Ohio State, and Ohio Wesleyan 
also report a great growth in intramural sports. At Michigan in- 
tramural contests between teams of women students have developed 
remarkably. At Michigan also the gymnasium is used to a much 
larger extent than formerly by summer school students. Efforts to 
induce upper classmen to participate in regular exercise have been 
stimulated. Intramural athletics has been coordinated with teacher 
training work in physical education so that senior and junior stu- 
dents act as instructors for intramural teams, organize teams, and 
officiate at games. Michigan’s new four-year teachers’ course in 
school health and physical education is thus made to contribute to 
the development of intramural athletics. 
The growth of freshmen teams since the adoption of the one- -year 
rule, commonly known as the freshman rule, which at first appeared 
to be a development which would encourage intramural sports and 
free the minds of freshmen somewhat for college work, has shown 
that freshmen athletics is subject to the same abuses as general college 
contests. Contests between freshmen teams of different institutions 
have grown to such a point that abuses are quite as serious as those 
arising from intercollegiate athletics in which teams represent the 
entire institution. Princeton and Harvard have, as a result, discon- 
tinued their freshmen contests. 
Important from the standpoint of defining the purposes and 
objectives of college athletics is the work of the Amateur Athletic 
Federation which developed from the Secretary of War’s Man-
-P-A-G-E-30
  
  26 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1922-1924 
Power Conference, held in 1922. The federation is attempting to 
define what constitutes physical fitness and to stimulate various 
agencies, including those of the colleges, to adopt standards and to 
direct their athletic and sport activities to the attainment of these 
standards. The University of Michigan is devoting consider- 
able time to working out a series of annual performance or physical 
efficiency tests for upper classmen. Similar standards for girls are 
being developed. Modification of men’s games when played by girls, 
to suit the physical characteristics of girl participants, and accept- 
ance of the idea that girl teams should always be coached and con- 
trolled by women, indicate considerable progress. : 
The purpose of all this is, of course, to make college sports and 
athletics contribute to health rather than to competitive advertising 
or to the development of students of marked physical prowess. 
The morals of college students undoubtedly have always been 
high, as compared with the morals of similar groups of young people. 
Aside from the supervision exercised by deans and the advice and aid 
which they give of a personal nature, the outstanding current dis- 
cussions which may be regarded as of moral significance concern 
drunkenness and suppression of smoking by girls. In view of the 
prohibition laws and regulations, institutions have felt that drunken- 
ness, especially public drunkenness, is an offense more serious than 
in pre-Volstead days. Princeton has undertaken to deal more de- 
cidedly with intoxication by means of suspension in cases which 
come to the attention of the college authorities. In the case of 
drunkenness for the first time the period of suspension is short; the 
second offense results in longer suspension and sending the student 
home, so that his parents may deal with the case as they see fit. 
In some cases expulsion results. The attitude of the University of 
Michigan is somewhat more decided. The president has been com- 
mended throughout the United States for his courage in dealing 
with the problem of drunkenness. In 1923 the regents passed reso- 
lutions upon the subject, and in the fall of the same year the uni- 
versity senate discussed this matter thoroughly. The decision was 
reached that cases of public drunkenness should be punished by 
dismissal. 
Although in the eastern States smoking by girls is not regarded as 
a matter of moral depravity but rather as one of convention or 
health, in the West and Middle West a moral significance is attached 
to smoking by girl students. An outstanding case is that of a girl 
student expelled for smoking in the Michigan State Normal School 
at Ypsilanti. This case received wide publicity because it was car- 
ried to the courts and because the judge sustained and commended 
the dean of women for her action. It remains to be seen whether the 
increasing freedom of women will result in making the standards of
-P-A-G-E-31
  HIGHER EDUCATION 27 
convention and moral practice for the two sexes more nearly the 
same. 
OUTSIDE CONTACTS 
More extensive and closer contact between the higher educational 
institutions and the outside world is intimately bound up with two 
matters which have given trouble to college authorities—freedom 
of speech and academic freedom. The former concerns the freedom 
with which college buildings and property may be used by student 
organizations and others for presenting ideas and facts which are 
the subject of discussion outside college walls. No general rule 
which will eliminate the necessity for discretion has been devised. 
In general, addresses of a scholarly nature or those of general inter- 
est are permitted and encouraged. Advocacy of destruction of the 
Government by violence or unlawful means or attack upon the 
accepted code of morals are forbidden. What constitutes an accepted 
code of morals is, of course, a matter of opinion. Critics of educa- 
tional institutions contend that when revision of conventional moral 
standards is in progress, institutions permit the greatest freedom 
to those who defend the conservative viewpoint, while those who are 
working for change are forbidden to present their ideas to students. 
One of the important matters of this kind which has aroused discus- 
sion and disagreement is the matter of birth control. Similar differ- 
erences of opinion arise in connection with political campaigns. No 
institution would forbid a general discussion of political issues; 
many will forbid the use of college or university buildings for pre- 
sentation of the claims of a political candidate even though such 
discussions and claims are presented freely in the newspapers and 
across the street from the campus. No doubt an institution has a 
legal right and a moral obligation to control the outside influences 
which are brought to bear upon its students; its standards of con- 
trol should be publicly known and impartially applied. 
The matter, however, of participation of the college staff in out- 
side discussions, either in the classroom or in public, presents some- 
what greater difficulties. A committee of the Association of American 
Colleges in 1922 formulated general principles in regard to this 
matter which after a year’s discussion were adopted in 1923. These 
principles deal with four points. First, they recognize that freedom 
of research should be maintained unless restriction is necessary in 
the interest of teaching. Second, the college should not place restric- 
: tion upon freedom in presentation of the teacher’s own subject in the 
classroom, in outside addresses, or in publications except such as are 
agreed upon in advance or such as are necessary for immature stu- 
dents. Third, they recognized the right and the duty of the insti-
-P-A-G-E-32
  28 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1922-1924 
tution to restrict discussion of outside matters in the classroom which 
is supposed to be devoted to instruction of a special kind. Fourth, 
that the teacher’s right of public discussion of questions outside his 
own field is the same as that of anyone else, except that the teacher 
must always make it clear that he and not the institution is responsi- 
ble for the views expressed. 
JUNIOR COLLEGES 
Mention has already been made of the fact that the first two years 
of college properly belong to the secondary field and of the fact 
that during these two years occurs the greatest mortality among 
students. The burden upon the institutions because of large attend- 
ance, as well as theoretical reasons, makes them friendly toward the 
idea of developing separate two-year junior colleges. It is the pur- 
pose of such institutions to render educational service along three 
lines. First, presentation of a liberal arts course of two years which 
will lead to entrance to the junior year in a college or university; 
second, conduct of two years of professional or preprofessional 
courses; and, third, offering two-year completion courses for those 
who do not desire to secure a degree or to lead professional lives. 
Friends of the junior college idea see in its future develpment pro- 
vision for a number of such institutions so conveniently distributed 
as to provide locally training of the kinds indicated. They believe 
that this will relieve the college of many of the problems which arise 
from immature boys and girls being severed from home connections 
and also will result in the college being able to concentrate its 
energies upon higher education rather than upon instruction of a 
secondary nature. The development of the junior college during the 
two-year period has been remarkable. In California in 1921 a bill 
was passed which makes possible the setting up under State aid of 
an extensive system of junior colleges. Those which undertake to 
prepare for the last two years of college work must be affiliated with 
the State university. They are inspected by the university, and the 
qualifications of the faculty must comply with university standards. 
The courses of all institutions must be approved by the State board 
of education and conform to minimum standards set up by the 
State board. This results in a system which coordinates the junior 
college with the public schools and with the university more closely 
than in any other State. In 1922 in the United States there were “ 
200 junior colleges, of which 4 were affiliated with high schools, and 
125 were reorganized small colleges. Dr. George F. Zook, president 
of the Municipal University of Akron, while chief of the division of 
higher education in the United States Bureau of Education, contrib- 
uted through his surveys a great deal to the development of this 
 
-P-A-G-E-33
  HIGHER EDUCATION 29 
movement. His studies of college distribution upon the basis of 
economic resources, population, transportation, and type of educa- 
tional service required resulted in recommendations looking toward 
reduction of competition between four-year denominational colleges 
by changing several of them to the rank of junior colleges and 
making them feeders for one or two strong institutions affiliated 
with the denomination concerned.

  CHAPTER IT 
SOME RECENT MOVEMENTS IN CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS 
By W. S. DrerrensaueH 
Chief. of Oity Sehoot Division _ 
So extensive and so complex has the modern city school system 
become that it is impossible in a brief chapter to treat more than a 
few of the recent educational movements. In addition to day schools 
the activities of the city school system include night schools, con- 
tinuation schools, special schools, health supervision, vocational in- 
struction, vocational guidance, clinics, etc. Reviews of some of these 
activities appear in other chapters of the Biennial Survey of Educa- 
tion, and discussion of them in this chapter is unnecessary. 
ADMINISTRATION 
Nothing more than usual is reported in the field of general admin- 
istration. Having small school boards elected at large has become the 
prevailing practice. Some difference of opinion still exists regarding 
the method of choosing boards of education, though authorities in 
school administration are generally agreed that the elective plan 
is upon the whole to be preferred to any method of appointment by 
city or other officials. 
The question of the relation of the city council to the board of 
education is perennial. Numerous instances might be given to show 
that there has been friction between them; but this is nothing new. 
Several attempts have been made to divorce school from municipal 
affairs. For instance, a bill sponsored by the New Haven Teachers’ 
League, to make the board of education independent of the city 
officials, was defeated at a recent session of the Connecticut Legis- 
lature. The claim made by the teachers’ league was that the finance 
board interfered unduly in the management of the schools. This, 
however, is an old story and may be duplicated in some of the other 
cities where the school boards are dependent upon the city officials 
for appropriations. 4 
ADAPTING THE SGHOOL TO INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES 
Within the past few years possibly more attention has been given 
to adapting the school to individual differences than to any other 
phase of school administration. The fact that children differ in 
ability to progress through the grades has long been recognized, 
31
-P-A-G-E-36
32 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1922-1924 
but the general use of intelligence and achievement tests has empha- 
sized the fact that there is a wide spread of mental ability in the 
same class—that some pupils are of the highest intelligence and 
others of very low intelligence. With all these facts before them, 
school administrators have come to see how absurd it is to expect 
children of the same chronological age but of different mental ages 
to progress through school at the same rate. 
In order to provide for these individual differences serious atten- 
tion is being directed toward plans that promise to break up what 
is known as the lock-step system of grading and promotion. In 
fact, since the beginning of the graded-school system various at- 
tempts have been made to devise plans to assure pupils’ continuous 
progress through school without repetition of entire grades. Semi- 
annual promotion was considered a means toward this end. More 
frequent promotion intervals, however, are considered desirable if 
it is possible to provide them, and several such plans have been tried. 
When Dr. William T. Harris was superintendent of schools at St. 
Louis, Mo., he organized classes with about five-week intervals 
between them, so that the brighter and more industrious pupils could 
be advanced without skipping a grade, and so that pupils not able 
to sustain themselves in the classes to which they were assigned 
could drop back to the class below without losing a half year or even 
a whole year. Not many cities adopted this plan, yet it had great 
possibilities, especially in a large school building where five or six 
groups could be formed from the same grade. This plan may, how- 
ever, be recognized to-day in the homogeneous grouping of pupils 
which is receiving serious attention in many cities. Of 215 cities 
furnishing information to the Bureau of Education as to the uses 
made of intelligence tests, 64 per cent are using them in the ele- 
mentary school for grouping pupils according to ability, 56 per 
cent in the junior high school, and 41 per cent in the senior high 
school. A few years ago only a beginning had been made in so 
classifying pupils. ! 
The question, however, has been raised whether the attempt to 
group children by ability would result in adaptation to individual 
differences. Dr. S. A. Courtis says:   
The Detroit results prove conclusively that, whether instruction be indi- 
vidualized or not, children of each level of intelligence, as shown by scores 
in mental tests, have a very wide range of achievement and very different 
rates of progress in any special skill * * *. Intelligence is a factor de- 
termining progress, but by no means the only factor, so that grouping on an 
intelligence basis is only a partial solution of the problem of individual dif- 
ferences. A complete solution is furnished by individualization of instruc- 
tion where any child, whether his intelligence is A, B, C, D, or E may go as 
fast or as slowly as his condition at the time demands.

RECENT MOVEMENTS IN CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS 33 
It is conceded that it is impossible to obtain perfectly homo- 
geneous groups, since no two pupils are exactly alike. Even 
children with the same intelligence quotients vary widely in their 
school progress. It is a matter of common observation that lazy, 
intelligent pupils may not make as rapid progress in school as do 
the industrious ones who are less intelligent. What may be con- 
sidered good grouping at the beginning of the school term may be 
found very poor a month or two after. Dr. Ernest Horn, of the 
University of Iowa, in summarizing studies made in Detroit, Mich., 
Los Angeles, Calif., Winnetka, Ill., San Francisco State Teachers 
College, and the University of Iowa, says:? 
All these data, gathered by five groups of investigators working independ- 
ently, point to this conclusion: Children do not fall into natural ability 
groups and can not be classified so as to yield homogeneous groupings; groups 
which appear relatively homogeneous at the time of classification soon vary 
more within themselves than they do from each other; different types and 
amounts of instruction are required by different children within each group; 
ability grouping does not solve the problem of adjusting schools to individual 
differences. 
Although the homogeneous grouping of pupils is not an ideal 
plan for adjusting instruction to individual pupils, it is generally 
conceded that such grouping makes for better adaptation to indi- 
viduals than does undifferentiated mass instruction. If, for in- 
stance, there are four fifth-grade classes in a school building, it is 
better to divide them into four or more groups on the basis of 
ability than it is to assign to each of the four teachers children of 
all degrees of ability and at all stages of progress within the fifth 
grade. 
Designed to reach the individual child more completely than does 
any method of grouping, several plans of individual instruction 
that have attracted wide attention may be mentioned. One of these 
plans originated at the State Teachers College, San Francisco, and 
has been adopted in other places under city school conditions. 
Winnetka, Tll., has given the plan the most thorough trial. 
Another plan of individual instruction, known as the Dalton 
plan, originated at about the time Winnetka began its experiment. 
The Dalton plan has been more widely adopted in England and 
other European countries than in the United States. Among the 
schools in this country that have adopted the plan are the South 
Philadelphia High School for Girls, Philadelphia Trade School, 
the Manhattan Trade School of New York City, and the Children’s 
University School, under the direction of Miss Helen Parkhurst, 
New York City. 
That more attention should be given to individualized instruction 
seems evident. The fact that children should be socialized must 
*Part II, 24th Yearbook, Nat. Soc, for the Study of Education, p, 166, 
 
-P-A-G-E-38
  34 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1922-1924 
not be forgotten. The elimination of all class instruction is not 
advocated even by the most enthusiastic supporters of any of the 
plans of individualized instruction. The Winnetka plan calls for 
a large amount of socializing work, as does the Dalton plan, through 
its provision for conferences and discussions. 
TEACHERS’ SALARIES 
Most cities have awakened to the fact that in order to maintain 
efficient school systems salaries equal at least in purchasing power 
to those of 1914 must be paid. Some cities have advanced salaries 
to such an extent that their purchasing power is greater than in 
1914, and others have made only nominal increases—with the result 
that the real salary is less now than in 1914. On the whole, how- 
ever, teachers’ salaries in city schools to-day exceed in purchasing 
_ power the salaries paid in 1914% Since 1922-23 there has been 
little increase in teachers’ salaries, amounting on an average to about 
3 per cent. 
During the biennium considerable attention has been given to 
the formulation of salary schedules and to plans for rating teachers. 
The single-salary schedule—that is, equal pay for equal training 
and experience—whether the teacher teaches in an elementary or 
a high school, is growing in favor among superintendents and 
teachers. The chief advantages chained for this type of schedule 
are the following: 
1. It is easy to operate and permits better business methods. 
2. It eliminates class consciousness among teachers. 
8. It contributes strongly to a feeling of unity and satisfaction in the corps. 
4. By financial recognition of additional experience and training, it promotes 
tenure. 
5. It attracts superior ability and training to the elementary schools and 
gives elementary teachers a higher appreciation of their services. 
6. It emphasizes high standards of professional attainment and encourages 
professional study and growth, thus producing more efficient teaching in every 
grade. 
7. It permits the transfer of teachers without financial loss from positions 
for which they are not adapted to positions where they can render efficient 
service. 
One of the arguments that has been advanced against such a 
schedule is its cost, since the increased expenditure for instruction 
would be ie ae if all the teachers placed i in the elementary 
schools were graduates of four-year courses in teachers’ colleges. 
The question of cost, however, should not be considered if teachers 
with four years of training are needed in the elementary schools. 
This is the point that should be settled in the minds of school boards 
adopting a single-salary schedule. If such a schedule is adopted and 
then the school board continues to employ teachers with only two 
  
®See Research Bulletin N. E. A., Public School Salaries, 1924-25.
-P-A-G-E-39
  a RECENT MOVEMENTS IN CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS 35 
years of training, the question at once arises, Why was such a 
schedule adopted? It is obvious, however, that whenever a school 
board sets the same standard of qualifications for elementary-school 
teachers as for high-school teachers the salary schedule should be 
the same. As already stated, the question to decide is whether 
elementary-school teachers should be required to attend normal 
school or college the same number of years as high-school teachers. 
If the answer is in the affirmative, there should be no hesitation in 
adopting a single salary schedule. 
According to a study* made by Elmer H. Staffelbach, of Stan- 
ford University, the average superintendent considers three years of 
scholastic training above the high school adequate for the elementary- 
school teachers, four years of such training adequate for teaching 
in the junior high school. and five years for teaching in the senior 
high school. 
Isaac O. Winsiow, superintendent of schools of Providence, R. L., 
writing on the adjustment of teachers’ salaries, says, regarding equal 
pay for equal preparation: 
It is easy to understand that such a scheme as this may be very com- 
fortable for the administrators of the system. The certificate of academic 
attainment is definite and automatically. determines the salary. No trouble- 
some questions can arise in the application of the rule. But there are serious 
questions that should be considered from an outside standpoint. Will the 
method stand the test of searching criticism? * 
EQUAL PAY FOR MEN AND WOMEN 
The question of equal pay for men and women doing the same 
kind of work has been discussed pro and con for several years, and 
some cities have adopted the plan of giving men and women equal 
pay. As a result, the school boards in these cities are being con- 
fronted with the following problems: Shall the salaries of women 
teachers be increased so as to equal those of the men, or shall the 
salaries of the men be reduced to equal those of the women, or shall 
there be an averaging of the salaries so that the school budget may 
not be increased? If the salaries of the men are lowered, will not 
many of them leave the profession? The question may be asked, 
If all salaries are raised to the level of the men’s salaries, what will 
be the result? It has been predicted that more men will be employed. 
Heretofore school boards have been paying men more than women 
because men could not be had for the salaries paid the women 
teachers; but owing to the fact that men had to be paid more, only 
a few men have been employed in many school systems. 
Certainly there should be no leveling-down process. If equal-pay 
laws mean anything, they mean that the salaries of women should be

raised to equal_those of the men; discrimination should not be tole- 
rated, but the men must not be driven out of the schools by lower- 
ing their salaries to equal those now paid women in cities where the 
women receive less salary than the men. 
RECENT SALARY SCHEDULES 
A recent salary schedule that has attracted attention is the one 
adopted by Congress for the District of Columbia. After one year 
of satisfactory probationary service teachers serve on tenure. 
Teachers with experience elsewhere may be placed in the fifth year 
of the elementary schedule and in the sixth year of the high-school 
and normal-school schedules. The schedule provides for Group A 
and Group B teachers. The Group B schedule provides for those 
teachers whose superior teaching, advanced study, and higher pro- 
fessional qualifications justify larger salaries than those paid 
teachers in Group A. The schedule for elementary and high school 
teachers is as follows:

GROWTH OF WORK-STUDY-PLAY OR PLATOON SCHOOLS 
The number of cities having work-study-play or platoon schools 
continues to increase. The first platoon school was organized by 
Supt. William Wirt, in Bluffton, Ind., in 1902, and the second was 
organized by him in Gary, Ind., in 1907. From 1907 to 1918, 4 
cities—Kalamazoo, Mich., Kansas City, Mo., New Castle, Pa., and 
Sewickley, Pa.—organized 15 schools on the platoon plan; from 
1914 to 1920, 35 other cities organized 148—that is, the increase was 
at the rate of 21 schools a year; and from 1921 to February, 1925, 
53 cities organized schools on the plan. By April, 1925, 93 cities, 
having a total population of more than 16,000,000, in 30 States had 
the platoon plan in one or more schools. Half the cities with a 
population of 100,000 or more, 1 out of every 5 cities with a popu- 
lation of 30,000 or more, and 31 cities with a population of 2,500 to 
30,000 have platoon schools. These cities are of all types, from large 
industrial centers to wealthy suburbs. 
In April, 1925, there were more than 500 schools on the platoon 
plan in the 98 cities. Twenty-one of the 93, or one-fourth of the 
total number, have adopted this form of school organization as a 
city-wide policy and are adding new schools each year. Akron, 
Ohio, Birmingham, Ala., Dallas, Tex., Detroit, Mich., Gary, Ind., 
Philadelphia, Pa., Pittsburgh, Pa., and Sacramento, Calif., fall into 
this group. Twenty-one of the 93 cities have introduced the platoon 
plan into nearly half their elementary schools. Ten have adopted it 
for their junior or senior high schools as well as elementary schools— 
Gary, Ind., East Chicago, Ind., Franklin, N. J., Greer, S. C., Newark, 
N. J., and Saginaw, W. S., Mich., fall into this class. 
The platoon schools vary in size from 100 to 3,000 pupils. Of 
369 schools providing information in regard to size, 63 have from 
100 to 500 pupils, 136 have from 500 to 800 pupils, 187 from 800 to 
1,500 pupils, and 33 from 1,500 to 3,000 pupils. In many instances 
the same city—for example, Birmingham, Ala.—has schools in each 
of these groups. 
Standing of platoon-school pupils in academic work compared 
with nonplatoon-school pupils —In all cases reported in which edu- 
cational tests have been given comparing the academic work of 
pupils in platoon schools and in nonplatoon schools, the standing of 
the platoon-school pupils is equal to or superior to that of the pupils 
in the nonplatoon schools. 
The superintendent of schools of Birmingham, Ala., reported in 
1924 that— 
During the past school year two groups of children in Grades IV to VIII 
were selected by the department of research of the Birmingham public schools, 
one from several nonplatoon schools, the other from several platoon schools. 
These children were approximately equal in their ability to learn and the  
-P-A-G-E-42
388 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1922—1924 
amount of learning already acquired, in intellectual maturity, and in the 
number of days in attendance during the period of investigation. On Decem- 
ber 15 they were measured by a standardized test in arithmetic, reading, his- 
tory, literature, language, geography, and spelling for the amount of learning 
they had acquired up to that time. Four months later they were measured 
again by a test of equal difficulty to see how much they had gained in all 
these subjects. This test shows that while the average pupil in the nonplatoon 
schools made a gain of nearly 51 points in his score, the average pupil in the 
platoon schools made a gain of almost 66 points in the same period, or 29.5 
per cent more than the one in the other type school. The amount of gain is 
such that, according to the experiences of the best authorities in educational 
measurement, should the investigation be repeated an infinite number of times, 
the chances are 20 to 1 that there would he a substantial difference in favor 
of the platoon schools. 
A report issued October 22, 1924, by the department of research 
and measurement, Pittsburgh public schools, Pittsburgh, Pa., where 
there are 40 platoon schools, records the results of educational tests 
in spelling and arithmetic given to pupils in platoon and nonplatoon 
schools. The report states that— 
In arithmetic it is evident that the platoon group is superior in all grades 
in that function of arithmetic which we call reasoning. The platoon schools, 
however, maintain almost the same supremacy when the scores for correct 
answers are considered. At no point do they go below the corresponding 
median score of the nonplatoon group. * * * All grades considered, in 
both arithmetical accuracy and arithmetical reasoning, the platoon type of 
school organization in Pittsburgh shows superiority over the nonplatoon type. 
Previous surveys in spelling and reading show similar superiority in favor of 
the platoon group. This superiority in the three R’s is worthy of commenda- 
tion in view of the fact that the platoon school carries an enriched curriculum. 
In addition to all the other excellent enriched activities, the platoon schools 
in Pittsburgh furnish more adequate training in the three R’s than do the 
nonplatoon schools.® 
Supt. S. O. Hartwell, of St. Paul, Minn., in an article published 
in the Elementary School Journal, February, 1925, “A sidelight on 
platoon schools,” gives the result of tests in platoon and nonplatoon 
schools in spelling, arithmetic, reading, and language. He prints 
graphs which he summarises as follows: 
  There was clear advantage of the platoon schools over the other schools not 
only in the general curve for each subject but im practically three-fourths of 
the grades, subject by subject. * * * Two factors seem to be largely respon- 
sible for the success of the platoon schools. First, the academic teacher of 
platoon classes is relieved of most of the special work. * * * The teacher's 
freedom from special subjects, therefore, makes for better concentration on the 
part of both teacher and pupil in the regular recitation, and concentration pro- 
duces results. Second, supervision is better adjusted, an advantage in both the 
regular and special subjects. In a word, the teaching staff in a platoon school 
is seldom intrinsically superior to that in other buildings, but it is better clas- 
sified and organized, which, in turn, leads to improved results.

  RECENT MOVEMENTS IN CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS 39 
Attitude of superintendents in schools in cities of 100,000 popula- 
tion or more toward the platoon plan—tIn September, 1924, the 
United States Commissioner of Education wrote to all superintend- 
ents of schools in the 68 cities having a population of 100,000 or more 
the following letter: 
The Bureau of Hducation, in response to a very general demand, has been 
endeavoring to collect full and complete information about the platoon system 
of schools. It is not the policy of the Bureau of Education to advocate or 
oppose the introduction of this or any other particular type of school organiza- 
tion, but we wish to be in a position to furnish information both with reference 
to the advantages and disadvantages of this plan. 
In order to enable us to carry out this policy, will you be kind enough to 
write me your opinion of the platoon system. Give us frankly the benefit of 
your experience, observation, and study, both as to the merits and demerits 
of the platoon school. 
Of the 56 cities replying, 24 had one or more schools on the platoon 
plan. All of these 24 cities were favorable to the plan, although one 
superintendent stated that as the platoon school in his city had just 
been organized they could not yet report on results. 
Of the remaining 32 cities which did not have schools on the work- 
study-plan or platoon plan, 5 superintendents reported that they 
were in favor of the plan; 1 reported that he was planning to have a 
platoon school during the next year; 5 said that they were not com- 
mitted for or against the plan; 1 reported, “We have not adopted 
it. We do not have the necessary halls and gymnasia for a fair trial 
of the plan”; 10 reported that they had “no experience with the plan 
and therefore had no opinion”; 8 gave no opinion at all; 3 confused 
the plan with the double session system by which half the children 
in a school come in the morning and the other half in the after- 
noon; and only 4 superintendents reported that they were unfavor- 
able to the plan. 
In other words, out of a total of 56 cities, 58.5 per cent of the total - 
number were favorable to the plan or were planning to have schools 
on this type of school organization; 39 per cent gave no opinion or 
said they were not committed for or against the plan, or that they 
had not started it because they did not have the necessary equipment, 
or confused the plan with the double session system; and only 7 per 
cent of all the cities were not favorable to the plan. 
RESEARCH AND TESTS 
A few years ago all questions of school policy were settled largely 
upon the basis of mere opinion. To-day mere opinion does not play 
such a prominent part in school administration, but as scientific 
data is often lacking it still plays a very large part. Whatever 
opinion is offered should be based upon facts, if there are any avail- 
able, rather than upon theory. School people, however, are slowly
-P-A-G-E-44
  
40 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1922-1924 
becoming more scientific. Boards of education, if composed of men 
and women accustomed to dealing with data, do not listen to ora- 
tions but ply the superintendents with questions regarding the most 
successful practices in school administration. 
Not content to depend upon guess work, boards of education are 
establishing research bureaus to collect and compile data regarding 
practically every phase of their respective school systems. 
In 1923 there were about 80 research bureaus connected with 
city school systems; now there are about 120 such bureaus, although 
they are not always so designated. In some of the cities, especially 
the smaller ones, a supervisor may do the educational research work. 
In some of the larger cities the research work is under the direction 
of an assistant superintendent. : 
The scope of a fully organized research bureau may be best ex- 
plained by briefly describing the research bureau of Detroit, Mich.: 
The function of the department of instructional research in the city of 
Detroit appears to be that of a headquarters; it formulates the educational 
policies to be carried out throughout the city school system. Its labors take 
the form of testing the work, surveying the work done, and appraising poli- 
cies in order to make and keep them efficient and truly serviceable. These 
labors are performed by its own staff, by the department of supervision, and 
by the personnel of the schools themselves. These comprehensive units are 
interwoven in organization and cooperative in activity, while each maintains 
its own individuality for the furtherance of mutual service. 
When the department was opened in 1914, 10 aims were set up by its 
director: (1) To measure the efficiency of the teaching; (2) to increase the 
number of children benefiting by school work; (8) to eliminate waste in 
subject matter and methods; (4) to aid in the adjustment of school training 
to the world’s needs; (5) to help teachers give greater assistance to individual 
children in accordance with the peculiar weaknesses, and (5a) to help teachers 
give greater facilities to individual children in accordance with their par- 
ticular aptitudes; (6) to set up objective standards, reasonable because based 
upon the measured ability of children, so that each child may have the 
pleasure of success; (7) to aid the superintendent and others in the prepara- 
tion of reports; (8) to aid in the continued professional training of teachers; 
(9) to supply any information about the Detroit system that may be wanted; 
(10) to maintain year after year a critical study of the Detroit public schools, 
in order that each year the same may be made more efficient. 
As a result of educational research in Detroit, a number of standardized 
tests and practice materials have been developed sufficiently to create a gen- 
eral demand for them throughout the country. Among these are the Courtis 
standard practice tests in arithmetic, the Courtis standard practice tests in 
handwriting, the Detroit first-grade intelligence test, the Detroit kindergarten 
test, Courtis-Smith picture-story reading lessons, and Detroit word-recogni- 
tion test. 
A few years ago the use of intelligence and achievement tests in 
the elementary and secondary schools was looked upon as a fad, but 
to-day the school superintendents who do not use such tests find 
themselves in a small reactionary group looking on and protesting 
as the educational world moves away from them. 
 
-P-A-G-E-45
RECENT MOVEMENTS IN CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS 41 
At first the standardized tests were used largely for the purpose 
of comparing one’s school with the standard score or with the scores 
made in other cities of the same size. This is no doubt one of the 
valuable uses of such tests, but it has been found that they may be 
used for many purposes. 
General intelligence tests are chiefly used for classifying pupils 
into Homogeneous groups and for supplementing the teachers’ esti- 
mates of pupils’ ability. They are used also for diagnosing causes 
of failure of admission to the first grade of the elementary school 
and for determining the promotion of pupils. 
An outgrowth of the use of such tests is the new type of examina- 
tion that has been introduced into many schools. The old general 
question type of examination was not easily graded. One teacher 
would grade a paper 90 per cent, another the same paper 70>per 
cent, and another 50 per cent or even less. The grading was purely 
subjective, depending upon the opinions of the persons doing the 
grading. The new type of examination admits of but one answer, 
which is either right or wrong. Since the pupil has to do little 
writing in this type of examination and the scorer little reading, the 
test can be made much more comprehensive than the old-style ex- 
amination. The traditional high-school examination usually con- 
sists of 10 questions and requires two or three hours. The new 
type may consist of 50 or 100 questions and requires about an hour 
of the pupil’s time. 
In brief, the progressive schools of the country are now relying 
upon objective rather than upon subjective tests. 
THE ALL-YEAR SCHOOL 
The movement to organize the city schools of the country on an 
all-year plan has made little progress. In fact in one city, Newark, 
N. J., where the plan has been in operation for many years, it was 
recommended that the all-year schools in that city be discontinued ; 
the board of education decided, however, to continue them until 
September, 1925. 
When the all-year plan was adopted in Newark it was believed 
that it would be possible— 
1. To save two years of the time now regularly required to com- 
plete the elementary-school course. 
2. To prove that under proper conditions of discipline and instruc- 
tion pupils will suffer no physical or mental injury by reason of an 
additional eight weeks of school attendance during the months of 
July and August. 
3. To prove also that the continuous session through July and the 
greater part of August saves an enormous loss of time and energy.
-P-A-G-E-46
    42 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1922-1924 
The superintendent of the Newark schools? says regarding these 
points: 
‘That there has been no physical or mental injury by reason of the eight weeks 
of school attendance in July and August may be granted as probably true. The 
testimony of a large number of teachers is to that effect. Some teachers claim 
to have felt the strain and others decline to remain to teach in July and August, 
fearing injury to their health. Those who have taught several successive sum- 
mers state that they have lost buoyancy and spirit because of the continued 
work, but they do not condemn the plan. The vice principals of the two schools 
longest established are now out on furlough because of ill health. It would be 
difficult to prove that the all-year work was the cause of these two breakdowns. 
The report of the medical department shows a larger number of exclusions in 
the all-year than in other schools. That might well be expected, because the 
schools are open longer and are larger. It is reasonably certain that there is no 
widespread injury to the health of children or teachers, or if there be injury to 
anyone it can not be definitely fixed as due to the all-year plan. The facts 
available are at least not sufficient to contradict the theory. 
It is extremely doubtful whether the all-year plan saves an enormous loss of 
time and energy. It is true that in June much time is spent in the traditional 
schools in reviews and in helping the children to organize their knowledge into 
usable form for examinations. That is clearly a part of the educational 
process, and it is an error to regard it as lost or wasted effort. There is value 
in going over old examination questions even, for such practice assists in clari- 
fying and classifying what has been learned and in fixing it better in memory. 
The fact that many immature and unfit pupils have entered the high schools 
seems to prove that the saving of this time is not justified; in fact, that at- 
tempted acceleration for pupils of elementary school grade is doubtful both 
as to-its wisdom and its results. 
The theory that pupils can be accelerated to the point of saving two years in 
an all-year elementary school is not true. There are three important reasons 
which make the theory fallacious. The first is the constantly changing enroll- 
ment in the schools, due to the shifting population ; the second, the five reor- 
ganizations each year, the additional one due to the summer vacation; the 
third, the criticism of the immaturity of all-year pupils and their failure in the 
high schools. The latter criticism is now causing a retardation of the children 
in the elementary schools. 
  The failure to secure acceleration of pupils as theoretically claimed 
for all-year schools, the impossibility of maintaining a stable and 
satisfactory organization throughout the year and of coordinating 
well such organization with the traditional school system, the unwise 
practice of sending immature and poorly prepared pupils into the 
high schools rather than making them as strong as possible in the 
elementary studies, are serious faults of the all-year system. The 
cost of the all-year schools is also a matter for careful consideration. 
Several of the smaller cities that have tried the all-year plan have 
discontinued it. 
One or two experiments, however, are not sufficient to prove or 
disprove whether it is desirable to organize the schools of the country 
  7 Corson, David B,, All-year schools: Newark School Bul., pp. 149-150, April, 1924.

  RECENT MOVEMENTS IN CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS 48 
on an all-year plan. Other experiments with this type of organiza- 
tion will be watched with interest. 
The technical high school of Omaha, Nebr., has been operating 
48 weeks a year for the past 7 years, and according to the super- 
intendent of schools the long term has proved very satisfactory. He 
cites the following advantages of the plan: 
1. The continuous use of the school plant, which indicates good business 
management and economy. 
2. The holding power of the school. This school formerly had a_ two- 
year commercial course, practically 90 per cent of the pupils taking the course. 
We give no two-year courses now—they are all full four-year in every de- 
partment. 
3. It enables the bright and energetic pupil to finish the course in three 
years, 
4, Having a greater use of the school building, pupils are able to move more 
rapidly through the system and thus make a clearance for others who want 
to attend—again economy. 
5. A pupil may of necessity be absent any quarter, fall, winter, summer, or 
spring, with the loss of only 12 weeks, instead of a full semester’s work. 
  Recently the schools of Nashville, Tenn., were organized on an all- 
year plan. The superintendent of schools of that city says: 
We were not deterred by the failure of the experiment elsewhere, but firmly 
believed in the necessity for and the flexibility of continuous all-year training. 
The school year in Nashville has been divided into four terms of 
12 weeks each; classes are started at the beginning of each quarter. 
The summer term differs in-no way from the three others in subjects 
taught or in amount of work covered. 
After the brief trial of the all-year plan, the superintendent of 
the Nashville schools says that the results confirmed the belief that 
there was real demand for educational opportunities at all times, and 
that better results through continuous occupation were attained in 
all the things regarded as of prime importance in the training of the 
child—regularity, punctuality, attention to duty, contentment, cheer- 
ful obedience to authority, health of body, mind, and soul. 
Mr. Theo. Fulton, principal, Jefferson High School, Los Angeles, 
Calif., makes the following deductions from his study of reports 
and answers to questionnaires regarding the all-year school :* 
1. The all-year school is an interesting experiment, differing considerably 
from the organization of the ordinary 10 months’ school. It is yet in the 
experimental stage but has received more commendation than criticism. 
2. Success of the plan may very largely depend upon— 
(a) Climatic conditions—favorable here. 
(b) Desire and need of a section of a city for such a type of school— 
involving summer idle time and economic pressure for early 
graduation to enable pupils to become breadwinners. 
8. School units involved should include at least one senior high, one junior 
high, and two or more elementary schools. Schools emphasizing vocational 
    
SLs Angeles School Journal, Feb. 4, 1924,
-P-A-G-E-48
    44 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1922-1924 
training would probably best serve the purposes of such an experiment. The 
very expensive shop and commercial equipment would thus be utilized for one- 
fifth more of the days in the school year, 
4, Benefits of the full-year system would accrue to certain groups of pupils, 
if results in Milwaukee, Omaha, and Newark may be taken as a basis for any 
conclusion. These groups are: 
(a) Over age. 
(b) Mentally slow or inferior. 
(c) Mentally superior. 
5. Benefits would also accrue to teachers in the all-year school. 
(a) Increase in salary would permit plans for further study and im- 
provement in the profession. 
(b) After continuous service for two or more years, one or more quarters 
could be utilized for rest or travel. 
6. The more frequent changes of classes and shorter periods between promo- 
tion would permit a closer check on curricula and adjustment of details. 
7. The expense involved in the operation of a group of four-quarter schools 
would be greater than the expense of 10 months’ schools plus summer-vacation 
schools. 
8. The larger number of pupils graduated, the saving of time in the child’s 
school life, the elimination of long vacations, resulting in great loss of interest 
and efficiency, and the utilization of expensive plants, now idle in summer-vacation 
time, could be set up against the expense mentioned in deduction No. 7. 
9. The four-quarter plan, properly organized, would represent better business 
administration as applied to school affairs. ‘ 
    That children should be kept poring over books for five hours a 
day for 48 weeks can not be defended. But the old-time school with 
nothing but the three R’s has passed away. More and more atten- 
tion is given to what are termed special activities, and still more 
time could be given them if the all-year plan were adopted. The 
real all-year school will come into existence when it broadens its 
work so as to give more time to play, handwork, and other activities 
that do not now receive much attention. After such a program 
children probably would not enter high school so immature, as much 
immaturity may be due to the fact’ that they have been held to a 
narrow program of studies. 
IMPROVEMENT OF TEACHERS IN SERVICE 
There seems to be no abatement in the efforts to provide means 
for the improvement of teachers in service, but the plan of holding 
a teachers’ institute for several days at a time is no longer consid- 
ered the best means of improving teachers. Attendance at summer 
school is considered so far superior to attendance at teachers’ insti- 
tutes that many school boards are providing additional increase in 
salary for those teachers who attend the summer session of such 
schools. A plan promising much is that of assigning some project, 
as the preparation of courses of study, to groups of teachers. In 
Oakland, Calif., for example, more than 700 of the 1,500 teachers 
have been actively engaged in the work of curriculum revision,
-P-A-G-E-49
RECENT MOVEMENTS IN CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS 45 
working on committees under the leadership of what is known as 
the supervision council. 
DEMONSTRATION LESSONS 
No doubt plans for the self-improvement of teachers originating 
with the teachers themselves are better than those that are super- 
imposed upon them. As an illustration of a plan for self-improve- 
ment that of Oakland, Calif., may be cited. The principal features 
of the plan are: 
(1) A system of demonstration lessons, (2) courses of professional study, 
(3) a permanent project and exhibit library, (4) a teachers’ professional 
library maintained in connection with the administrative offices of the super- 
intendent of schools. 
In a circular issued by the superintendent of the Oakland schools, 
special attention is given to improvement of teachers by means of 
demonstration lessons. Several types of demonstration lessons are 
provided: (1) Demonstrations given by the supervisors as instruc- 
tors, the teachers acting the part of pupils; (2) demonstrations by 
supervisors with classes of pupils; (3) demonstrations by the class- 
room teacher at work in her own room; demonstrations through ex- 
hibitions of school work. 
SABBATICAL LEAVE 
The granting of sabbatical leave seems to be meeting with favor 
from some of the school boards of the country. Recently the New 
York Board of Education granted sabbatical leaves of absence to 
150 teachers, all of whom had been in the service of the city public 
schools for 19 years or more. The leaves take effect February 1, 1925, 
and will continue until September 1, 1925. They are granted for 
study, travel, or the recovery of health. The plan is financed with- 
out expense to the board of education, sufficient amounts being 
deducted from the salaries of the teachers on leave to pay for sub- 
stitute service during their absence. 
Among the smaller cities that have adopted a plan for sabbatical 
leave for teachers, Pueblo, Colo., may be mentioned. In that school 
system a teacher of 10 or more years’ service may be granted a sab- 
batical year to attend an educational institution of higher learning 
for the purpose of improving her professional equipment as a teacher, 
and shall be allowed for such year one-half of the annual salary 
she would receive if actually employed in the schools. No teacher, 
however, shall receive during the sabbatical leave more than $900. 
Not more than three members of the teaching force may be absent 
at any one time for such courses; and the college, university, or 
normal school attended, as well as the character of the course se- 
lected, must be approved by the superintendent of schools.

RATINGS 
One of the purposes of teacher rating is no doubt to show the 
teacher her strong and her weak points, but too frequently teacher- 
rating schemes have been used merely as a means of determining 
whether a teacher shall or shall not receive an increase in salary or 
whether she shall be retained in the school system. <A rating scheme 
that is not open to the inspection of the teachers has practically no 
value as a means of improving teachers. Rating schemes that may 
be used cooperatively by supervisors and teachers, not as a means 
of determining salary increases but as a means of supervision, un- 
doubtedly are of great value in improving teachers in service. Many 
superintendents are issuing for the teachers’ use facsimiles of the 
rating plans that had formerly been used by the supervisors only. 
Other superintendents are issuing rating schemes which have been 
devised for the exclusive use of teachers, so that the teachers may 
learn to know themselves, to find their strong points and their weak 
ones. 
THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CURRICULUM 
Every child is affected by the elementary school curriculum, since 
all children are required to attend school for a certain number of 
years. Many never get beyond the sixth grade, and many of those 
completing the sixth grade do not.enter high school. It is thus 
evident that the elementary-school curriculum should be given at 
least as much attention as the high-school curriculum. 
Not enough thought has been devoted to the elementary school, 
but with the advent of better prepared elementary-school super- 
visors, principals, teachers, and research workers, the elementary 
school is coming into more prominence. 
All authorities in education agree that the time is at hand for a 
thorough revision of the elementary as well as the secondary pro- 
gram of studies. In fact the entire program from the kindergarten 
to and including the first two years of college is in need of revision. 
New studies have forced themselves upon the schools until the 
question has been raised as to whether the course of study has been 
enriched or impoverished. Dr. Charles McMurry, commenting upon. 
the necessity of a revision of the elementary curriculum says: ° 
We have now in the schools a troublesome multiplicity of studies. As we 
go on increasing the number of studies and topics, the time spent on each 
subject must be decreased. With twice as many studies on the docket, each 
can receive only half as much time. In a complete up-to-date school we now 
have about 16 or 18 studies, twice as many as of old. A seventh grade class 
was reciting in 11 different subjects in one day. Five or six lessons a day 
would be far better. This multiplication of studies makes for short and 
snappy treatment of topics. For important subjects the time allowed is wholly

inadequate. Because of this shortage of time, teachers and textbooks are com- 
pelled to abbreviate and epitomize. Many of our textbooks in the middle and 
upper grades and in the high schools show this tendency to shorten and con- 
dense topics to a remarkable degree. This crowding of many studies upon the 
school program has produced a sketchy and superficial method of study. The 
whole course of study tends to become a memorized table of contents rather 
than an interesting and instructive development of knowledge. Stated in this 
form the result is simply distressing. 
Such a condensed and overcrowded course of study breeds a host of evils. 
It leads both teachers and children into a bog where they fail to find sure 
footing. Crowded with this excessive variety of knowledge children lose 
confidence in themselves and look upon studies as a bore. They fall into a 
dull memorizing scheme of study that fits the requirements, while thinking 
and doing and all the higher activities are blighted. This fatal effort to 
condense knowledge actually fosters the two most serious blunders that can be 
made in teaching: First, it abolishes concrete illustrations and reasoning pro- 
cesses from instruction ; second, it imposes upon children the dry schedules and 
formularies of a sapless knowledge. 
Our conclusion is that while our course of study has been flooded with this 
excess of riches brought by new subjects, the outcome is a steady deterioration 
through condensation of textbooks into outlines, summaries, and what may be 
called catalogues of topics; in other words, impoverishment of studies. 
The foregoing describes the condition of the elementary school 
curriculum in most cities; but now that the need of curriculum revi- 
sion is seen, various organizations, schools of education, State and 
national committees, and bureaus of educational research are engaged 
in studying the problem. Several cities have revised their courses 
of study with a view to simplifying them and with certain objectives 
in mind. They have not resorted to the use of scissors and paste jar, 
but have made first-hand studies to determine what should be in- 
cluded in and what omitted from a particular course, and how the 
various studies may be so organized that they are not isolated from 
one another—as is the case at present in many of the schools of the 
country, each subject being taught without any relation to any other 
subject. 
Several city-school systems, as Detroit, Mich., and Long Beach, 
Calif., have formulated courses of study designed to secure progress 
at the normal rate for all pupils. At Long Beach, for example, it is 
the policy of the school to develop two modifications of the regular, 
or Y course of study. One of these, the X course, is a maximum or 
enriched course; the other, the Y course, provides only for the mini- 
mum essentials. The Z courses are for normal pupils. The super- 
intendent of schools, in describing them, says: 
If school organization makes any subnormal pupil a member of a Z class 
the course can not be considered as intended to meet his needs. Teachers 
should guard against the belief that a slow pupil is necessarily subnormal. 
The effort to bridge the gap between the kindergarten and the 
first grade should not go unnoticed. For many years the first-grade 
 
-P-A-G-E-52
48 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1922-1924 
teachers gave slight attention to what was taught the children in 
kindergarten. The tendency now is for these teachers to build upon 
the foundation laid by the kindergarten teachers. Several kinder- 
garten-primary courses of study have been prepared to assist in uni- 
fying the work of the kindergarten and the primary-school grades. 
One of these courses is that prepared by a committee of principals, 
supervisors, and teachers of Los Angeles, Calif. In the course in 
language-art, for example, the first-grade work is built upon the 
work of the kindergarten; the same is true for number and nature 
study. In number work the kindergarten child begins with very 
concrete work, which is continued on through the second grade, with 
steps of increasing difficulty. 
THE JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL 
For many years the junior high school was a mere hazy concep- 
tion. Finally it became a reality in a few school systems. ‘To-day 
junior high schools are numbered by the hundreds. Many school 
superintendents who have organized one or two junior high schools 
are planning to organize more, and most of those who have not or- 
ganized such schools are planning to do so at the earliest possible 
moment. The junior high school is beyond the experimental stage. 
All that remains now is to adopt it as rapidly as conditions permit 
and to study its various problems in administration and organi- 
zation. 
The junior high school movement has swept the country because 
school men and others have long been convinced that there are 
certain defects in the conventional type of organization on the 84 
plan. The purpose of the junior high school in general is to remedy 
these defects. By pointing out some of the recognized shortcom- 
ings of the 8-4 plan of organization, it is clear what purposes the 
junior high school serves. 
Every child must come into possession of the school arts, or the 
tools, but it is believed that these can be acquired in less than eight 
years. At present in some cities of the country the elementary- 
school course is only seven years in length, and there is no evi- 
dence to show that the children completing a seven-year course 
do not have the school arts well enough mastered to begin high- 
school work. It is now known that a child can begin junior high- 
school work after six years in the elementary grades. In fact, a 
5-3-3 plan has a few advocates. Several cities already have the plan 
in operation. Surely by the end of the sixth grade a child should be 
able to take up secondary school work such as is offered in leading 
junior high schools of the country. Some years ago very few per- 
sons attended an elementary school more than 50 or 60 months, 
especially those residing in the rural and small-town district, yet
-P-A-G-E-53
  
= RECENT MOVEMENTS IN CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS 49 
many of them began formal high-school work with this amount of 
preparation. Now it requires 72 or 80 months to complete an elemen- 
tary course of eight years. 
It is evident that the elementary-school work has been stretched 
out over two more years than are necessary. In schools organized 
on the conventional 8-4 plan the work of the seventh and eighth 
grades repeats to a very great extent that of the fifth and sixth 
grades. In the fifth grade the pupil studies common and decimal 
fractions and again in the seventh. He studies percentage and inter- 
est in the sixth grade and again in the eighth. In the fifth grade he 
studies geography from a small textbook and in the seventh grade 
the same topics from a larger book. All this repetition is unnecessary. 
The seventh and eighth grade work of the conventional school 
looks backward, whereas it should look forward, so that the pupils 
may do better the things ahead of them—whether it be work in 
school, store, factory, or office. General introductory courses in the 
seventh and eighth grades are now recognized as having such a for- 
ward look. That such courses are better, whether the pupil continues 
in school after completing the junior high school or whether he 
drops out of school, is now pretty generally conceded. 
One of the defects of the old 8-4 system was that pupils when 
entering high school were confronted with an array of curricula 
and courses about which they knew nothing. They were told to elect 
a curriculum and then possibly courses within the curriculum. They 
had had no inkling of the nature of the high-school course. Algebra 
and geometry were mere terms, as were Latin, French, social science, 
biology, physics, and chemistry. The general.course in mathematics, 
physical science, social science, languages, manual arts, and other 
subjects provided in the junior high school introduces the “pupils to 
the specialized courses in the senior high school by permitting them 
to explore their interests, aptitudes, and capacities. In the manual 
arts, for instance, a boy may explore in many lines, so that if he 
leaves school at the end of the junior high school course he will have 
a better idea for which trade he is fitted; and if he remains to enter 
senior high school, he will know which of the technical or trade 
courses lis can pursue with most profit. 
Prof. Thomas Briggs,’? speaking of exploratory courses with 
references to their value in enabling pupils to elect wisely, says: 
This exploration, then, gives each pupil some knowledge of the general 
field more exhaustively studied in higher courses, and thus enables him to 
choose more wisely his future curriculum. Our system of electives in the 
senior high school and in college presupposes an intelligent and informed 
elector; under the old system he might be intelligent but not informed. If, 
as is quite possible, such exploring courses should lead a pupil into a general 
elective which later he might wish to change, he still could do so and not be

-P-A-G-E-54
50 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1922-1924 
more retarded in his program than most pupils are to-day. Exploration at 
the age of 12 to 14 is much more economical than it is two or more years 
later. 
This is a point that can not be too much emphasized in enumerat- 
ing the purposes of the junior high school. General introductory 
courses in the junior high school make possible two things that 
were not possible in the old grammar-school grades, namely, (1) 
exploration, so that a pupil may elect wisely when he enters senior 
high school, (2) a good general education rather than a drill upon 
the three R’s. 
One of the purposes of the junior high school is to economize 
time—not necessarily in the sense that pupils will spend fewer years 
in school, but that they may employ their time more profitably. 
No doubt after a thorough reorganization of the program of studies 
from the kindergarten up, and not from the college down, much 
more can be accomplished than is now the case in the 12 years de- 
voted to elementary and secondary instruction. Possibly one or two 
years of junior college work could be done within the 12 years, thus 
saving the city boy and girl two years in college. This, however, is 
a matter for experimentation. 
FORMS OF ORGANIZATION 
The larger cities have uniformly adopted the 6-8-3 form of or- 
ganization. In the smaller cities there is not such uniformity of 
practice. Some of these have adopted the 6-8-3 plan and others 
the 6-6 plan. In some, schools have been organized on the 6-24 
plan. The 6-3-3 plan, however, seems to be the prevailing one 
and to meet with the favor of most authorities on secondary educa- 
tion. In some few cities where the 11-year public-school system is 
in operation, the schools have been reorganized on the 5-3-3 plan, 
which is undoubtedly better than the 7-4 plan in that this latter 
plan does not offer any opportunity for exploratory courses. The 
5-8-3 plan has the same purpose as does the 6-8-3 plan. The only 
question to be answered is whether the elementary-school course 
should be shortened to five years. Possibly this can be done in 
those cities where children enter the first grade of the elementary 
school at seven years of age, as is the case in San Antonio, Tex., 
in which city the schools have been reorganized on the 5-3-3 plan. 
Experimentation with this type of organization will be watched 
with interest. 
HOUSING 
In the larger cities the tendency is to erect separate junior high 
school buildings having their own organization. In some of the 
medium-sized cities a modified 6-8-3 plan has been adopted by erect- 
 
-P-A-G-E-55
  RECENT MOVEMENTS IN CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS 51 
ing a combination junior-senior high school building, the junior 
high school occupying one section of the building and the senior 
high school another section. The special activities rooms—as audi- 
torium, gymnasium, and shop—are used in common. One principal 
is in charge of beth schools, but the actual duties are often delegated 
to an assistant. It is apparent that in a school system enrolling 
about 1,000 pupils in grades 7 to 12, this type of organization is 
more economical than that of having a separate junior high school 
building. { 
In the smaller cities where the secondary school enrollment is only 
two or three hundred, the junior-senior high school usually consti- 
tutes one unit. Certain advantages may be secured by housing the 
-seventh to twelfth year pupils in one building. These may be stated 
as follows: 
1. The seventh and eighth year pupils are benefited by a better material 
equipment, including the use of the gymnasium and shops of the senior 
school. 
2. The seventh and eight year pupils gradually approach senior high school 
conditions by personal acquaintance. This bridges the chasm between ele- 
mentary and secondary school work to a large extent. 
8. A feeling of mutual respect and a spirit of mutual helpfulness are 
created between the teachers of the earlier and later secondary school years. 
4, The seventh-year work is better taught (upon the whole) in the 6-6 plan 
by a more considerable treatment of ninth-year pupils. 
5. The one secondary-school principal exerts a more positive and beneficial 
influence oyer his pupils by securing two added years for their supervision and 
guidance. 
6. This housing in one building may prove the entering wedge for the 
introduction of many modern and so-called junior high school ideas of man- 
agement and method by which the whole year period of secondary educa- 
tion may be harmonized. 
    More may be expected of junior high schools when all the pupils 
of a city are enrolled in such schools. If there are only a few 
junior high schools scattered throughout a city the graduates of such 
schools will have some difficulty in transferring to the regular four- 
year high school. Once a city has organized one or two junior 
high schools, some adjustment should be made in the junior high 
school to the courses offered in the regular high school. 
According to the report of the committee that made a survey of 
the junior high schools of New York City *— 
Experience has shown that if there are only a few junior high schools 
scattered throughout the various boroughs so that only a few 9B graduates 
enter senior high schools from them, those pupils have to encounter not only 
all the difficulties which pupils meet who go from one school to another, but, 
in addition, the disadvantages arising from the fact that their classmates are 
much more familiar with the high-school organization, the teachers, the

methods, etc., because they have been in the high school for a year. Assuming 
that the principals and teachers of the senior high schools are sincerely anxious 
to aid junior high-school graduates, many problems present themselves which 
are difficult of solution. If the number of such pupils is small, it is almost 
impossible to organize them into separate classes or give them special atten- 
tion. If such pupils are merged with the pupils who have been in the high 
school for a year, even slight differences in courses of study and textbooks, 
amount of ground covered, etc., stand out very prominently. These difficulties 
are removed, however, when, as a result of the organization of a system of 
junior high schools, large numbers of junior high-school pupils enter grade 
10A of the senior high schools each term. Under such circumstances principals 
of senior high schools should be able to solve whatever problems arise through 
slight differences in method or subject matter. 
Furthermore, it is an unwise educational policy to have two sets of schools— 
namely, the traditional 8B and the junior high schools—in a given neighbor- r4 
hood, by which some pupils attend the first type of school, pursue a uniform 
course of study through the seventh and eighth years and are transferred to 
senior high schools at the end of the eighth year, and other pupils attend the 
junior high schools for the seventh, eighth, and ninth years of instruction. 
All experience points to the conclusion that since the organization of a 
system of junior high schools has been decided upon as an educational policy, 
steps should be taken to extend it, term by term, as far as practicable, with 
the ultimate aim of relieving the senior high schools of all or nearly all the 
pupils of the first year and of having all or nearly all the seventh, eighth, and 
ninth pupils included in junior high schools. 
That there is a certain amount of confusion and irritation between 
the junior high school and the senior high school in the regular 
four-year high school is evident, but according to Mr. J. M. Glass,'* 
director of Junior high schools for the State of Pennsylvania: 
The responsibility for the ninth-year curriculum in 6-8-3 school systems has 
passed in part and should pass altogether from the senior high school to the 
junior high school. With the responsibility should also go the opportunity 
to reconstruct the ninth-year core curriculum in accordance with the recon- 
struction already initiated in the seventh and eighth years. Insistence by the 
colleges on 16 college-entrance units constitutes a condition which threatens the 
full realization of the principle of continuity in the reconstruction of the junior 
high school curriculum. The present tendency to modify college-accrediting 
relations in harmony with the objectives of the new 6-3-3 plan should be 
presented and encouraged until the junior high school is able to carry on 
unhampered the curriculum reorganization already initiated and partly effected 
in the seventh and eighth years. The junior high school must be free to make 
of itself a self-contained and integral unit in the public-school system.

CONSTRUCTIVE TENDENCIES IN RURAL EDUCATION 
By KarHerine M. Coox, 
Chief, Division of Rural Education, Bureaw of Education 
ConTEents.—Introductory statement—Tendencies to equitable school support—An impor- 
tant equalizing tendency : The improvement of the teacher staff—Supervision: A con- 
structive and equalizing factor in rural education—Centralizing tendencies in 
administrative organization for efficiency and economy—Tendencies in secondary 
education for rural children. 
INTRODUCTORY STATEMENT 
The most conspicuous and pertinent tendency in rural education in 
the biennium is that toward better understanding of and intelligent 
accomplishment in the direction of more equitable distribution of 
school opportunities and school expense burdens. Rural education 
is still the weak spot in the American educational system. Equality 
of educational opportunity has in the past been the principle about 
which lay the most of discussion and the least of action. Ideals are 
ever in advance of accomplishment. It is therefore notable that the 
passing of this biennium marks a decided tendency toward complete 
emergence of rural education from the realm of sentimental oratory 
and general promotion to that of statesmanship and professional 
achievement. 
Professional achievement is manifest in the growing number of 
research studies in rural-school administration and practice and con- 
ditions concerned with rural children. Among the important inves- 
tigations made during the biennium worthy of special mention are the 
State survey of Texas; a state-wide study of conditions and needs in 
Pennsylvania, including rural-teacher training, rural high schools, 
ete., undertaken by specialists within and without the State, and con- 
templating changes in school legislation; an investigation of public 
education in Missouri; a study of the measurement of educational 
need as a basis of distributing State aid in New York; a number 
of research studies of conditions of children in two rural town- 
ships in Iowa, conducted by the University of Iowa; and an investi- 
gation for the formulation of a State elementary course of study 
now in progress in California, financed in part by the Common- 
wealth fund, These examples indicate a new professional attitude 
affecting rural schools in an increasing number of States. State-

wide testing programs through the use of intelligence and standard 
achievement tests are reported from Nevada, Maryland, Connecticut, 
Louisiana, and Montana under the direction of State departments. 
A full discussion of the question of the equable distribution of 
school facilities in the United States would involve a lengthy treat- 
ment of many phases of the subject. This chapter can give but a 
brief résumé of tendencies in rural education. Details of accomplish- 
ment in 48 States, if attempt were made to enumerate them, would 
confuse rather than enlighten. For this reason it is believed that to 
select from among the accumulation of testimony certain outstanding 
and representative lines of achievement as indicative of the trend of 
accomplishment, rather than to attempt a complete account for each 
State, will be as enlightening as possible, with the time and space 
limitations necessary. A brief résumé of the most important move- 
ments in certain arbitrarily selected but significant fields of rural 
education follows. 
TENDENCIES TO EQUITABLE SCHOOL SUPPORT 
Among the factors upon which equalization of opportunity is based 
financial support looms large. We are committed to a program of 
full elementary and secondary education as the minimum to be 
offered to all children regardless of place of living. Basic to the car- 
rying out of this conception is an equitable distribution among 
taxing units of school-tax burdens according to ability and of educa- 
tional facilities for children within the responsible unit, namely, the 
State. Upon recognition of these truths rests the fate of rural edu- 
cation. The biennium has added to the general knowledge of the 
inadequacy of present sources of support and of inequitable methods 
of distribution. Several important studies of educational conditions 
State-wide in scope, as in Texas, Missouri, and West Virginia; 
county and township surveys, as in Michigan and South Carolina, 
have been made or are in progress, which have emphasized weak- 
nesses in the financing systems of the States concerned and have 
called general attention to them in others. Several volumes have 
been added to the series of studies presented by the educational 
finance inquiry commission, and other important studies of State- 
school financing of major interest have been made during the period. 
These are among the factors which have resulted in an increased 
realization of the inadequacy of present sources for securing money 
for the support of schools and of the unsatisfactory methods still 
prevalent in the distribution of funds, leading to renewed serious and 
widespread efforts on the part of several States to replace them. 
Marked effort to discover sources of income not yet tapped for school 
support has been made as it became more fully realized that property 
tax is neither adequate nor reasonable as the sole source of support.
-P-A-G-E-59
  RURAL EDUCATION 55 
In all such efforts the rural schools are those in which the greatest 
need exists, and therefore the chief beneficiaries from careful and 
serious study and consideration. 
Two distinct tendencies are apparent, the first toward increasing 
school revenues from new and old State sources; the second toward 
better methods in the distribution of State funds designed primarily 
to equalize tax burdens and educational opportunity, and at the same 
time encourage local effort and initiative. In some States in which 
increased revenue has been secured new sources of income, such as 
adoption of a severance tax, as in Arkansas, have been found, and 
the amount so raised distributed either on the regular basis in vogue 
or a new and more nearly equalizing one. In other cases some form 
of equalization fund has been secured from old sources increased in 
amount and distributed among units within the State on the basis of 
need. In others, increased State contributions or subventions to aid 
specific school functions or activities or school buildings or equip- 
ment have been provided. 
In most cases States which succeed in securing increased funds 
inaugurate at the same time better methods of distribution. Indeed, 
an equalizing fund is not properly so named unless the appropria- 
tion secured is properly distributed. States which contribute from 
State sources a large percentage of the total support generally 
purpose and necessarily achieve some approach to equalization, 
though unwise methods of distribution of State moneys tend to 
nullify that purpose. In some States securing increased funds has 
been possible without at the same time securing scientific methods 
of distribution, generally due to difficulty in changing constitutional 
provisions. The tendency, however, has been to secure both. IIli- 
nois is an example. During the year 1923 the State appropriation 
for schools was increased very considerably. At the same time a law 
was passed discontinuing the per capita method of distribution and 
apportioning funds on a more nearly equalizing basis. Certain ques- 
tions concerning the constitutionality of this act delayed putting the 
improved method of distribution into effect until 1924. The full 
purpose of the new law was not, therefore, realized until that year. 
In Massachusetts and Maryland increased funds were appropri- 
ated from State sources and scientifie methods of distribution 
| adopted during the biennial periods. A brief description of the 
plans followed in each of them is given as illustrative of good prac- 
tice. Until about 1919 Massachusetts depended almost wholly on 
local funds for the support of her schools. Since then the State has 
contributed increasing amounts year by year. Data for 1924, as re- 
ported from this State, show the equalizing effect of a relatively 
small percentage of total expenditure from State funds if distribu- 
tion is made on a scientific basis. The Massachusetts general school  
-P-A-G-E-60
  56 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1922-1924 
fund law was designed to equalize local school expenditures be- 
tween larger and smaller towns and to increase teachers’ salaries, 
thereby encouraging the employment of trained teachers. This 
fund is distributed to towns whose valuation is less than a fixed 
minimum and whose expenditure exceeds a fixed tax rate. The 
amount varies directly as the local tax and inversely as the valua- 
tion. ' According to a statement from a State department of educa- 
tion, the amount of this appropriation so distributed in 1923 was 
$4,782,644, exceeding that of 1922 by about $45,000, the total amount 
averaging approximately 10 per cent of the total school expenditure 
of the towns to which it was distributed. The percentage of this | 
State fund varies among towns from 8 to 30 per cent of the total — 
per capita expenditure. The local per capita tax revenue without 
equalization varies from $57 to $74 (in round numbers) ; the amount 
of State aid per capita from $6.47 to $24.50, while the total ex- 
penditure varies among these towns from $74 to $81 (in round num- 
bers) per capita. The State, by paying an average of 9.8 per cent 
of the total per capita expenditure, reduces a discrepancy among 
towns from approximately $17 as between those of lowest and high- 
est valuation groups without supplementation by State funds, to 
$7.93 so supplemented, with the poorest towns in the highest ex- 
penditure group. 
STATE PROGRAM IN MARYLAND 
During the biennial period just closed Maryland has put into oper- 
ation a system of State financial participation in school support, the 
chief characteristics of which are: (1) Increased State school budget ; 
(2) provision of equalizing fund and its distribution on a scientific 
basis. Provisions of distribution of the fund are: (a) Basis of need, 
thereby supplying sufficient State funds to 15 counties to enable them 
to maintain standards; (0) State assumes two-thirds of the cost of 
state-wide plan of supervision; (¢c) State pays one full-time attend- 
ance officer in each county; (3) increased State subventions mainly 
for the purpose of providing special aid to high schools, for training 
teachers in service, and for free textbooks. 
Maryland’s budget for school purposes for 1923 represented an 
increase of approximately 26 per cent over that provided for the 
preceding year. Of this increase the largest item was that providing 
for an equalizing fund. This was distributed to 15 counties, which, 
having levied the regular 67 cent county tax rate prescribed by 
statute, were still unable to carry out standards set by the State for 
higher salaries and better prepared teachers. This type of equaliza- 
tion is augmented in its results by another State subsidy providing 
for the payment from State funds of two-thirds of the salaries of 
officers for supervising instruction in all counties. For this purpose
-P-A-G-E-61
RURAL EDUCATION 57 
a new salary schedule increasing the minimum salaries was provided 
by legislative action in 1922. Besides paying two-thirds of the sal- 
aries of supervisors, the State pays the entire salary up to $1,200 of 
one attendance officer in each county. These three provisions are all 
equalizing measures in their nature and effect. 
The State school budget provided also a fund of $12,000 for train- 
ing teachers in service in their home communities. State aid to 
approved high schools was increased 50 per cent, and State appro- 
priations for free textbooks 3314 per cent at the ‘same legislative 
session. 
COURT DECISION AFFECTING EQUALIZATION FUND IN OKLAHOMA 
An unusual and significant opinion was handed down by the 
Supreme Court of Oklahoma on September 9, 1924, upholding the 
validity of an act appropriating an equalization fund of $650,000 
designed to aid in paying teachers’ salaries in districts which, hay- 
ing levied the constitutional limit of local school tax, could not 
maintain school for an eight months’ term. The constitution of Okla- 
homa limits the local district tax for school purposes to 15 mills. 
Many districts with low assessed valuation are unable, with the maxi- 
mum of levy and the apportionment from State sources, to support a 
term of eight or nine months of school. The appropriation was made 
to assist such districts. In handing down its decision the court held 
that the burden of education rests on the State, and that an appro- 
priation of the kind indicated is part of the fulfillment of the State’s 
obligation to maintain a system of public schools; that responsibility 
for a State system implies some degree of uniformity and equality of 
opportunity. A special session of the legislature in Oklahoma, held 
in 1923, provided for a State fund amounting to $15 per capita for 
children of school age. This act was, however, declared uncon- 
stitutional. 
PROGRESS OF CERTAIN STATES IN SCHOOL SUPPORT 
The following is a brief summary of achievements in the direction 
of more State support or better methods of distribution of State 
funds: 
Arkansas.—Trebled State support through income, severance, 
cigarette tax laws, and pistol regulation law, effective 1924. 
Delaware.—Special State aid granted for paying all transporta- 
tion charges; $100,000 for 1923, and $105,000 for 1924. Supple- 
mentary law permits all districts to bond themselves. 
Florida.—Change in constitution which has resulted in substantial 
increase for a large number of rural schools through State, county, 
and local funds.  
-P-A-G-E-62
  58 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1922-1924 
Illinois —In 1923 eliminated apportionment of State school funds 
on census basis. Provided for apportionment which considers 
“teacher-school-day ”; pupil attendance; assessed valuation of prop- 
erty; bonus for teachers in one-room schools. Also increased fund. 
Indiana.—State tax, 7 cents on every $100 and 50 cents poll tax 
for common-school fund; 70 per cent of this fund for teachers’ sal- 
aries; 30 per cent becomes a relief fund for maintaining elementary 
schools for term of eight months and for certified or commissioned 
high schools for minimum required term. This is apportioned to 
counties which levy a tax of $1 on $100 taxable property and 25 
cents poll tax and still have not enough money to run the schools 
for the required length of term. It may be used either for payment 
of salaries of teachers or for current operating expenses necessary 
to lengthen the term. 
Kentucky.—A number of counties increased their levy to reach 
the maximum, i. e., 50 cents on $100. Legislature authorized presen- 
tation of State bond issue of seventy-five millions, of which five 
millions were designed for rural schools. Defeated by popular vote. 
Maine—During the biennium a State school fund to aid rural 
schools has been placed in operation. Used at the discretion of the 
State superintendent as an equalizing fund to aid in teachers’ sala- 
ries, buildings and equipment, and consolidation, as well as to stim- 
ulate special progressive educational movements. 
Maryland—First distribution of State equalization fund to 
counties unable to meet standards, with county school tax levy of 
67 cents. Amount was $234,733 in 1923 and $255,447 in 1924. State 
aid toward salaries of administrative and supervisory officers and 
high-school aid increased about 50 per cent over that of 1922. County 
superintendents’ salaries increased materially during the biennium. 
Massachusetts —About $70,300 added to State fund distributed in 
biennium over that of 1921 and 1922. This amount to approxi- 
mate 10 per cent of total expenditure distributed on inverse ratio to 
tax valuation. 
Michigan.—State aid of $200 to each school maintaining nine 
months’ term when cost of seven months’ schools is $12 or more per 
thousand of assessed valuation. 
Oklahoma—Equalizing fund provided to pay teachers in certain 
poor districts. 
Pennsylvania —Legislation of 1923 increased State aid for teach- 
ers’ salaries to districts of low valuation, and for transportation. 
Rhode Island.—Aid for high school increased $10 per pupil. Maxi- 
mum State support for supervision increased from $750 to $1,000 
per district. Equalizing fund apportioned at discretion of State 
board of education and State aid distributed on equalizing basis.

South Carolina.—Increase in county and State support for schools, 
$2,000,000. Guarantees seven months’ school by supplying State 
funds when deficiency occurs after fixed tax rate is reached by coun- 
ties and districts. 
Tenmessee.—State aid to standard and consolidated schools in- 
creased in amount. 
Virginia.—In year ending 1928, one-third total number of counties 
assessed the maximum rate. Year ending 1924, one-half the counties 
assessed maximum rate. State aid to rural school libraries increased. 
One thousand aided. 
Wyoming.—State oil royalty for schools. Distribution considers 
among other things length of term and aid to transportation. 
Indiana, West Virginia, Mississippi, Texas, Tennessee, Wisconsin, 
and Missouri are among the States whose State departments of edu- 
cation have promoted large State legislative programs involving 
State support in some measure during the biennial period. In a few 
of these States recent educational surveys are made the basis of the 
program. As an illustration of the type of activities or provisions 
promulgated in these programs the following from the educational 
program of Texas and from the State superintendent’s program from 
Tennessee are presented : 
The Texas educational program advocates 15 points, of which the 
most important are those providing for a nonpartisan State board 
of education which shall appoint the State superintendent, enacting 
a modified county unit law providing for the employment of the 
county superintendent by the county board, providing for a county 
tax, amending the teacher certification law, increasing State school 
funds, amending the attendance law, and providing for a minimum 
term of six months. 
The Tennessee educational program includes 11 points, not all of 
which require legislative action. The most important are as follows: 
Improved county administration; a minimum eight months’ school 
term; revision of the elementary course of study; changes in the re- 
quirements for licensing county superintendents and teachers, salary 
scale to be included; equality of educational opportunity for all chil- 
dren, including State equalization funds; and a State school archi- 
tect. 
AN IMPORTANT EQUALIZING TENDENCY—IMPROVEMENT OF 
THE TEACHING STAFF 
Progress toward improvement in rural teaching service during 
the biennium has been characterized chiefly by two definitely con- 
structive achievements: (1) Substantial rise in minimum qualifica- 
tions demanded for teaching certificates; and (2) increased and 
 
-P-A-G-E-64
  60 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1922-1924 
improved facilities for training rural teachers through the estab- 
lishment of departments of rural education or the offering of special 
courses for rural teachers in teacher-preparing institutions, particu- 
larly State normal schools and teachers colleges. This has been 
accompanied by the introduction of special courses for rural ad- 
ministrators and supervisors in these and other higher institutions 
of learning. There has been wider recognition of the necessity of 
setting up state-wide, reasonable minimum standards for certificates 
acceptable in any type of school, even the lowest as to salary and 
other standards, and of the fact that different standards for teachers 
in urban and rural schools are unjustifiable as a permanent policy 
and indefensible except as a temporary expedient to tide over an 
interval until equivalent standards can be put into operation. 
LEGAL PROVISIONS FOR CERTIFICATING TEACHERS 
The result of these measures is that certification laws are being 
revised or replaced by new and improyed provisions. Among the 
replacing provisions, the following tendencies are noticeable: (a) 
Toward complete centralization of the certificating authority in the 
State department of education. (5) Raising standards gradually 
to prevent radical shortage of teachers, to give teachers in service 
the opportunity to prepare for higher certificates without abandon- 
ing their. teaching positions, and to sound by a time limitation suf- 
ficient warning to prospective candidates for teaching certificates to 
make the necessary preparation. (c) Setting up minimum stand- 
ards or prerequisites for the lowest grade certificate and requiring 
gradually increasing amounts of professional training—each year 
more nearly approximating the goal usually set forth in the law 
itself or State department regulations of graduation from a stand- 
ard normal school as a minimum prerequisite. (d) Elimination of 
one or two classes of low-grade certificates. (¢) Ultimate elimina- 
tion of examination as a basis for issuing teaching certificates. 
Leading the procession in the effort to establish minimum creden- 
tials equivalent to graduation from a State normal school are Wash- 
ington and Connecticut which, during the biennial period just 
passed, enacted laws providing for the accomplishment of that goal 
in 1927; Pennsylvania, which had previously set the same year for 
the accomplishing of the same standard; and California which, 
according to reports from the State department, has established the 
requirement of two and one-half years beyond high-school gradua- 
tion and has set the standard of three years to be reached gradually — 
but at no definitely stated date.? 
  
* California stili issues county certificates on examination. The percentage granted on 
examination is small. 
 
-P-A-G-E-65
  RURAL EDUCATION 61 
Following the principle enunciated in the laws and practices in the 
foregoing States are the States in another group which have now 
attained a standard of one year (36 weeks) of professional training 
above high school, but have set no definite date for attainment of 
the higher standard, though the apparent hope of officials in charge 
is that they shall later do so. Indiana is an example. The law 
passed in 1923 raised qualifications for certificates of all kinds and 
set up as a minimum prerequisite for the lowest grade of cer- 
tificate high-school graduation and 36 weeks of professional train- 
ing in addition, the latter to be obtained in a standard or approved 
normal-school course. To procure the rural teachers’ license a candi- 
date must also have specialized in the work of the one-teacher school. 
Other States which report having reached an equivalent standard 
of attainment or have laws setting a definite date for attaining it 
are: Michigan, to be attained in September, 1925; New Hampshire, 
effective July, 1923; Oregon, effective January, 1925; Utah, effective 
July, 1924. In Utah the law also provides that the one year above 
high-school training required shall include specified educational 
subjects. 
As a means of raising standards a few States abandoned the 
practice of issuing lower (usually third grade) certificates. Among 
these are New Mexico, which reports having raised requirements 
for all certificates, increased salaries, and abolished the third-grade 
certificate through the law passed in 1923; Kansas, Virginia, and 
Tennessee, all of which have abolished their lowest grade of cer- 
tificate during the biennial period. Maryland is raising standards 
by a salary scale which offers increases in salaries of teachers holding 
a second-grade certificate (representing high-school graduation and 
six weeks of professional training in addition), and those of higher 
grades, but providing no increase for teachers with third-grade 
certificates. In addition, renewals are difficult to obtain. Thus, 
continuation of teaching on third-grade certificates is penalized. 
Alabama reports the basis of certification changed from examina- 
tion to professional training. Kentucky reports “a new certifica- 
tion law looking toward the issue of certificates on credentials only.” 
Several States report that the number of certificates issued on ex- 
amination is decreasing. Washington, for example, reports a de- 
crease in the number of such certificates of 44 per cent in 10 years. 
Several other States, notably New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Con- 
necticut, Maryland, and Michigan, report decreases in the number 
of low-grade certificates issued. 
Other States reporting increased requirements during the biennium 
are: Minnesota increased minimum prerequisite, effective Septem- 
27301°—27—_5  
-P-A-G-E-66
62 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1922-1924 
ber, 1924, to four years of high-school training; Montana the same 
prerequisite, effective the same date. Nebraska, in 1923, enacted a 
law raising the requirements to completion of the eleventh grade as 
prerequisite for the lowest grade of certificate, effective September, 
1924; and completion of the twelfth grade as a minimum for the 
lowest grade certificate, effective September, 1925. Vermont reports 
a minimum of completion of four years of high school, effective 
September, 1924. In Rhode Island the State board is systematically 
raising the minimum requirements for teaching certificates. Florida 
reports increased requirements without definite statement as to the 
exact prerequisite. Arkansas and Utah have recently enacted laws 
requiring higher qualifications, including special training in ad- 
ministration and supervision for county and other rural-school 
superintendents and supervisors. Practically all new laws center 
responsibility for certificates in the State department or with State 
officials, thus abandoning the policy of county or local control. 
The importance to the cause of rural education of prerequisites 
for teaching certificates which include minimum standards for aca- 
demic and professional training should not be overlooked. Excel- 
lent as is the practice of raising the standards for certificates of 
higher grades and of giving more and more consideration to pro- 
fessional training and to specialization in training courses, attain- 
ments of this character do not reach the crux of the situation, namely, 
the prevalence of unqualified teachers in the small, one-room rural 
schools. These schools can be reached only when the State actually 
enforces as a minimum prerequisite standards equivalent to high- 
school graduation and some professional preparation of higher 
grade. Urban communities whose schools are in charge of pro- 
fessional superintendents have formed the practice of looking.about 
and bidding for teachers professionally qualified. Rural school 
board members, mainly responsible for the employment of rural 
teachers, have the layman’s point of view and too often fail to dis- 
criminate among the different grades of certificates and as to the 
educational attainments to which they testify. In the large, the 
best.safeguard for rural children is a State law exacting as a mini- 
mum for any certificate high-school graduation and additional pro- 
fessional training two years in duration. This standard may be 
approached gradually. The experience of several States indicates 
that this method of dealing with the problem of raising certification 
requirements does not result in a shortage of teachers nor impose 
an undue hardship upon the teaching staff. 
Centralizing the certificating authority in the State dopartiea 
of education is of equal importance to the efficiency of rural schools.
-P-A-G-E-67
  
  RURAL EDUCATION 63 
It assists in preventing inbreeding of ideas and dominance of local 
considerations in the employment of teachers. The examination 
method, while it exists, will continue to be the short cut to teaching 
positions used by those who have not the inclination or the ability 
to take the more arduous and expensive course of securing profes- 
sional training in higher institutions of learning and securing cer- 
tificates through credentials rather than by examination. 
. 
THE PREPARATION OF RURAL TEACHERS 
States raising the requirements for teaching certificates to the 
extent of demanding professional training must logically accom- 
pany the demand with the provision of adequate facilities for offering 
training courses either in State teacher-preparing institutions of 
higher grade or those connected with secondary schools, as in Mich- 
igan, Wisconsin, and Ohio. The movement for offering specialized 
courses or establishing special departments for training rural teach- 
ers is growing, paralleling a movement for specialized training for 
other groups, such as kindergarten-primary, elementary, interme- 
diate, junior high school, and the like. It is becoming more and 
more recognized that the special problems involved in the administra- 
tion, supervision, and teaching of rural schools’ demand similar 
specialization. Certification laws demanding higher qualifications 
and specialized courses for rural teachers, supervisors, and adminis- 
trators have led also to higher entrance requirements to rural cur- 
ricula. Such requirements are now well established in all but a few 
of the teacher-preparing institutions of higher grade. Rural teacher 
curricula have been organized and placed on the professional level, 
requiring for completion from one to five years above high-school 
graduation. Departments of rural education,s meaning generally 
those having one or more full professors devoting full time to this 
field, have been established in nearly 40 teacher-preparing institu- 
tions. Differentiated curricula for teachers specializing as rural 
teachers are offered in a constantly increasing number of institu- 
tions, and special certificates for rural teachers are required or recog- 
nized in several States. 
One hundred and twenty-two State normal schools and teachers 
colleges now offer 257 courses in rural education. Practically all 
teacher-preparing institutions assist in supplying the demand for 
rural teachers through their regularly established courses. Many 
institutions supplement the regular courses with rural sociology, 
  
*No uniform definition of this term is established. The terminology used in announce- 
ments or catalogues is accepted in this chapter, 
 
-P-A-G-E-68
  64 - BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1922-1924 
rural economics, and other courses pertaining to rural life, thus 
offering partially differentiated preparation for teaching in rural 
communities. A few institutions have established the practice of re- 
quiring as a constant from all students at least one general course 
in rural education. 
Among the problems that teacher-training institutions must meet 
in preparing teachers for rural schools, provision for observation 
and practice looms large. A number of institutions have affiliated 
groups of one-teacher rural schools, often in several counties ad- 
jacent to the institution, as well as one or more consolidated schools 
which are used for the purpose indicated. Critic teachers, and in 
most cases administrative officers in charge, are regular members 
of the faculty of the institution, receiving salaries equivalent to 
those paid the other members. Courses are generally so arranged 
that students in the rural department are enabled to spend full time 
at their schools during the observation and practice period. 
The enrollment of rural teachers has been no small factor in the - 
remarkable growth in attendance in summer schools and extension 
courses. A few States which have passed certification laws, in 
which higher qualifications are made effective gradually, depend on 
summer schools, éspecially those on the quarter basis, as a means of 
enabling teachers in service to reach the advanced standards. The 
form of in-service preparation is supplemented in some States by 
reading and correspondence courses conducted by State departments 
of education. Alabama reports 86 per cent of the teachers in the 
State doing professional study during 1923-24; 40 per cent of these 
receive State credit for their work. Wyoming reports 50 per cent 
of her teachers in summer school attendance last year; Arkansas an 
80 per cent increase in such attendance last year; and Pennsylvania 
a 183 per cent increase in the past three years. 
Normal training courses of secondary grade or in connection with 
secondary schools are maintained in 23 States. Three States— 
Maryland, Nevada, and Virginia—have recently discontinued the 
plan. Oregon expects to discontinue it after this year. Two other 
States report the expectation of eliminating teacher-training work 
in high schools at an early date. Another reports that such second- 
ary courses are not receiving encouragement in that State because 
the State normal schools are rapidly taking over the task of supply- 
ing the demand for prepared teachers. Five States—Michigan, 
Minnesota, New York, Ohio, and Vermont—maintain the work on 
a postgraduate basis; that is, high-school graduation~is required for 
entrance to the course. Another State, North Carolina, plans to place 
the work on a postgraduate basis beginning in 1925. According to
-P-A-G-E-69
  RURAL EDUCATION 65 
Minnesota’s experience, the raising of entrance requirements for 
these courses has increased instead of depleted the enrollment. The 
number of high schools giving teacher-training work has increased 
in two States, Michigan and Wyoming. 
Only a few new normal schools have been reported to the bureau 
as established during the biennial period. A number have been en- 
larged. During 1923, State normal schools were opened at Glass- 
boro, Newark, and Paterson, N. J., and at Morehead and Murray, 
Ky. State normal schools have been voted but not as yet opened for 
students at Salisbury, Md., Kingsville, Tex., and Centralia, Wash. 
Mississippi expects to establish another State normal school at an 
early date. Colorado provided for the establishment of the Adams 
State normal school to devote itself chiefly to the preparation of 
rural teachers, but made no appropriation for its maintenance. 
Progress in providing proper facilities for the training of rural 
teachers and in securing and holding adequately prepared teachers 
in one-teacher schools has not been adequate nor country wide in 
extent. In a number of States the teacher staff is far below the 
approved standard. There is still a decided shortage of teachers 
in service and an insufficient number to fill annual replacements if 
the standard is set, as it should be, at graduation from a standard 
normal school. Even fixing the standard at one year beyond high- 
school graduation, reports from various States indicate a decided 
shortage. Encouragement is gained from the fact that a number of 
States have made such marked advance that the practical possibility 
of others to achieve a prepared teaching staff is beyond the stage of 
argument. Encouragement is gained also from the improvement in 
certification laws and in staffs of teachers in service from a number 
of States. Michigan, for example, reports that 60 per cent of the 
rural teachers, in 1924, had completed one year of professional 
preparation beyond high-school graduation. Connecticut reports 
that 68 per cent of the beginning teachers in one-room schools last 
year were normal-school graduates, although only 35 per cent of 
the total one-teacher school staff had equal training. Considerably 
more than half (57 per cent) of the 805 graduates of the Maryland 
State normal schools entered one and two teacher rural schools last 
year. Louisiana reports 67 per cent of all the teachers as normal 
school or college graduates. With the exception of the city of New 
Orleans, Louisiana is almost wholly a rural-school State. 
SALARIES OF RURAL TEACHERS 
Coordinate with the problem of securing rural teachers with ade- 
quate academic and professional attainments is that of obtaining
-P-A-G-E-70
  66 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1922-1924 
commensurate salaries. Unless salaries justify the expense in time 
and money of pursuing professional courses, rural teachers will not 
qualify on the same basis as those of urban schools. That many 
States recognize this is proved by the present tendency to accompany 
laws demanding increased requirements for certificates with a 
minimum salary scale varying according to experience and training. 
Those States in which the greatest difficulty is encountered in pro- 
moting higher standards on a State-wide scale are generally those 
in which salaries are low and the State unwilling or unable to pro- 
vide increases from State funds or to force them from local sources. 
Thus the desire to increase qualifications must wait on the ability of 
local communities to raise money through local taxation to provide 
additional income. Adequate financing is now the basic considera- 
tion in rural-school improvement. Sentiment is ripe for efficient 
schools, even for drastic changes in administrative organization if 
necessary. The money to finance efficient programs must still be 
found in many States. 
During 1923-24 the Bureau of Education continued the policy be- 
gun in 1922 of making annual studies of salaries of rural teachers. 
The number of county superintendents reporting and correspond- 
ingly the number of teachers whose salaries are reported increase 
each year. The information collected indicates that school officials 
are retaining the ground gained in salaries during the war and post- 
“war years but are not gaining substantially in securing increases in 
their salary scales. As would be expected, the greatest gain in 
amount has been made in consolidated schools, though one-teacher 
schools have ‘profited by the increasing recognition of the necessity 
of paying larger proportionate salaries. The following table shows 
the salary tendency in each of the five classes of schools indicated 
from 1922 to. 1924 in all the States:

Table 2 shows a fair increase in the average teachers’ salaries 
reported in 1924 over 1923. It shows also slight increases in the 
average annual salaries of teachers in the one and two teacher 
schools, a decline in salaries in 24 States which was great enough to 
amount to an average loss of $23 in the annual salary of the 13,850 
teachers reported in the three or more teacher schools. It shows also 
an increase of $53 in the annual salaries of teachers in consolidated 
schools reporting, and a very slight increase in the salaries of teachers 
in village and town schools not consolidated. The number of States 
showing decreases in salaries is indicated in the table. For the 
rural teaching group as a whole there is an increase of $24 in the 
average annual salary paid in 1924 over that paid in 1923. Compari-

SUPERVISION—A CONSTRUCTIVE AND EQUALIZING FACTOR IN 
RURAL EDUCATION 
Progress in supervision during the biennium has been concerned 
more with intensive work toward a higher quality of service than an 
increase in the number of supervisors or extent of the territory over
-P-A-G-E-72
  68 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1922-1924 
which supervision is furnished, although substantial improvements 
have been made in both these aspects also. 
SUPERVISION IN COUNTY UNIT STATES 
Among the States which have done notable work in improving 
the quality of supervisory service under the direction of their respec- 
tive State departments of education during the biennium are Mary- 
Jand and Alabama. Both are organized with the county as the 
administrative school unit, and both include in their State depart- 
ment staffs professionally prepared rural supervisors, two of the 
desiderata for success in rural supervision, A brief description of 
the work in these States is presented as representative of the activ- 
ities in several other progressive States similarly organized. 
The plan followed in Maryland.—The last biennial report of the 
Commissioner of Education noted the passage of a law in Maryland 
in 1922 providing for state-wide rural supervision. This law be- 
came operative in the fall of that year. The past two years have seen 
its accomplishment. Under the terms of this law supervisory of- 
ficers were provided according to the number of teachers, two-thirds 
of the salaries to be paid from State funds. Certain standards of 
educational qualifications for supervisory officers were set up; and 
two types of supervisors, namely, supervising teachers and helping 
teachers, the latter more or less under the direction of the former, 
were provided. From the former, minimum academic and professional 
qualifications equal to college graduation, with special training for 
instructional supervision and four years of experience in elementary 
school work, are required. 
For the first time, in 1923-24, there was at least one supervisor 
or helping teacher in every county in Maryland. One county had 
six supervisory officers at the close of the biennial period. Some 
counties have not yet secured the full quota as provided by law, 
namely, 40 teachers per supervisor, either because qualified persons 
were not available or patrons were not fully convinced of the value 
of supervision. It was therefore deemed wiser to enforce the law 
gradually until both these essentials are attained. In 1923 the 23 
counties of the State employed 39 supervisors and helping teachers. 
In 1924 the number had increased to 44, lowering the number of 
teachers per supervisor to an average of 50 and approaching some- 
what nearer the goal of 40, the standard fixed in the law. 
Maryland has 7 counties with fewer than 80 teachers, in each 
of which one assistant in addition to the county superintendent is 
now employed; 7 counties having from 80 to 119 teachers in which, 
under the terms of the law, 2 assistants should be employed; 4 with 
120 to 185, in each of which 3 supervisory assistants are allowed; 1
-P-A-G-E-73
  RURAL EDUCATION 69 
with 186 to 235, with 4 supervisory assistants; 2 with 236 to 285, 
with 5 supervisory assistants; and 2 with 286 to 335 teachers, with 
6 supervisory assistants; a total of 59 supervisors if the quota were 
filled. The present number, 44, is 15 short of that provided by law. 
The staff of the State department as a whole, including its re- 
search service, and through members especially assigned to rural 
school supervision, has largely devoted its efforts during the past 
two years to improving the quality of the work of the supervisors 
in service. Standard tests in the elementary subjects, notably read- 
ing and spelling, have been given throughout the State. Results 
have been tabulated, studied, and interpreted by specialists in this 
field, and remedial work has been carried on, all under the general 
supervision of the State department staff working through the 
county superintendents, supervisors, helping teachers, and teachers. 
From August, 1922, to March, 1924, eight pamphlets or bulletins 
were issued from the State department designed to improve the 
quality of instruction given and to stimulate achievement on the 
part of teachers and supervisors. 
Special attention has been given to elimination of the excessive 
amount of retardation and overageness in rural schools. Very 
complete studies of age-grade and pupil progress have been made 
throughout the rural schools of the State. 
Where the emphasis is placed in Alabama.—Maryland provides 
for and finances a plan of supervising rural schools which is com- 
pulsory for all counties. Alabama provides for a voluntary plan 
financed by the counties themselves. Approximately half the coun- 
ties employ instructional supervisors. Supervision, therefore, be- 
comes a matter of finding a sufficient number of trained people to 
fill the necessary positions, on the one hand, and a method of financ- 
ing the program, on the other. Apparently further progress in Ala- 
bama waits on securing more adequate financial resources. Recent 
information indicates that there are 65 supervisors (39 white and 26 
colored) in 82 counties at the close of 1924, and a total of 13 members 
of the State department staff engaged all or part time in the super- 
vision of rural schools. 
The supervisory personnel has improved in training and through 
length of service by the setting up of higher standards of require- 
- ments for the county supervisors employed. The minimum qualifica- 
tions are now set at three years’ teaching experience, graduation from 
a standard normal school, and, in addition, a year of professional 
training. This means the addition of one year of training to the 
minimum requirements exacted in 1922. The number of supervisors 
holding bachelors’ or masters’ degrees has increased during the 
biennium because of these higher standards. The qualifications of 
teachers in the supervised counties have also improved in a marked 
 
-P-A-G-E-74
  70 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1922-1924 
degree during the biennium and ‘under the influence of supervision 
At the close of the biennial period 1923-24, 81 per cent of the teach- 
ers in supervised counties held second or higher grade certificates and 
19 per cent, third-grade certificates. For the State as a whole 12.2 
per cent of rural teachers held professional (highest grade) certifi- 
cates, compared with 15 per cent holding them in the supervised 
counties. 
PROGRESS IN NONCOUNTY-UNIT STATES 
The Missouri plan.—The 1923 session of the Missouri Legislature 
made an appropriation for rural education which enabled the State 
superintendent to provide a type of supervision for rural schools 
somewhat different from that in any of the other States. “Missouri 
now has six rural supervisors, one in the State department and 
one in each of five teachers-college districts. The supervisors use the 
teachers college as a center from which they work among the county 
superintendents in the district. During the year these supervisors 
spend a large part of their time in holding demonstration meetings 
for the teachers under the general direction of the county superin- 
tendent. This officer divides his county into five districts. All of the 
schools in each district, except the one in which the demonstration 
meeting is held, are dismissed, the teachers of the dismissed schools 
coming to the center point. The program consists of from six to 
eight lessons of the usual period length in rural schools. The dem- 
onstration is followed by a conference in which the aim of the lessons, 
the manner of presentation, and the results are discussed. Instructors 
and professors from the staffs of the State teachers colleges have 
assisted the supervisors in demonstration meetings and by other means 
of cooperation. During the year in some counties as many as 99 per 
cent of the teachers and a large percentage of the school directors 
have been reached through these meetings. 
Plans for supervision in Idaho.—By mutual arrangement the State 
department of education and the two normal schools of the State 
inaugurated a system of rural supervision, with two supervisors in 
the field, throughout most of the school year, each normal school 
furnishing one supervisor. The supervisors cooperate with the 
county superintendents of the various counties. Teachers are brought 
together in small groups and given opportunity for observing dem- 
onstration lessons given by or under the direction of the supervisor. 
General discussion of problems follows. One whole day and an 
evening session are devoted to each meeting. 
Indiana conducts an experiment in supervision—aAn experiment — 
in rural supervision of unusual significance has been under way dur- 
ing the past two years under the general supervision of the State 
superintendent in Indiana. The experiment is financed by the Gen-
-P-A-G-E-75
RURAL EDUCATION 71 
eral Education Board and directed by the director of the school of 
education of Indiana University. Two counties were chosen for 
demonstration work in supervision. Two other counties, with simi- 
lar school conditions and taxable wealth, were selected as check 
counties. Tests selected from the Stanford achievement test were 
given to all pupils in grades 3 to 8 in all four counties, affecting 
2,771 children in the demonstration counties and 2,685 in the “con- 
trol” or check counties. They apparently established the fact that 
the school attainments of the pupils of the two demonstration counties 
and those of the check counties were approximately the same at the 
beginning of the experiment. The training of the teachers, type and 
» equipment of buildings, and other governing factors were also com- 
parable. Two supervisors were chosen for each of the demonstration 
counties, and in the check counties only such supervision as the 
county superintendent had time’ for was given. At the end of a 
year’s work tests were again given in the four counties. The second 
tests showed that children in the demonstration counties had pro- 
gressed in school work at a rate 14 per cent higher than in the 
unsupervised counties. The experiment is to continue through the 
school year 1924-25 under the same general plan. 
Michigan begins county supervision.._During the biennial period 
four counties in Michigan have established supervision under county 
direction through one or more of the following: Assistant superin- 
tendants, supervisors, and helping teachers. Besides supervision in 
these counties, a group of 30 or more one-room schools in the vicinity 
of Ypsilanti are supervised as an established part of the training of 
rural teachers and supervisors at the Michigan State Normal College. 
The work is carried on under the direction of the rural department of 
the college. Tests are made under controlled conditions designed to 
measure the results of supervision on the quality of instruction and 
the progress of pupils. 
County supervision established in California —California in 1922 
provided an appropriation from State funds for the payment of rural 
supervisors in a manner similar to that in vogue for the distribution 
of State money for teachers’ salaries. A minimum attendance 
unit of 300 pupils is required before a supervisor can be employed. 
Under the provisions of this law, 55 of the 58 counties in California 
now employ rural supervisors, the number depending upon school 
attendance. In one county six are employed. Both general super- 
visors and special supervisors in music and art are employed. 
There is no state-wide plan of organization of the supervisory staff 
within the counties. General supervisors, special supervisors, and 
regional or sectional supervisors are employed, the plan varying 
among counties.
-P-A-G-E-76
    
72 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1922-1924 
County school programs in Kentucky.—During the past two years 
State supervisors of rural schools have assisted county superintend- 
ents and boards of education in formulating a county-wide progres- 
sive program. Twelve counties have been studied and county school 
programs initiated. These programs have been organized under the 
leadership of county superintendents and provide for present and 
future needs of the schools. 
Financial conditions force retrenchment—New Hampshire and 
Delaware are the only two States which report reduction in super- 
visory forces during the biennial period. In Delaware a reduction of 
the appropriation for the maintenance of schools required a curtail- 
ment of the supervisory force. The smaller rural grade schools, . 
formerly under the supervision of the regular rural supervisors, were 
therefore placed under the supervision of their respective principals, 
the rural supervisors confining themselves largely to one and two 
teacher schools and advisory duties with the principals in the larger 
schools. In New Hampshire similar reductions in the State appro- 
priations resulted in reducing the staff by two members. 
Reports from other States—During the biennial period New York 
established a division of rural education in the State department. 
The amount paid district superintendents from State funds toward 
their salaries was increased from $1,800 to $2,400, thereby raising the 
average salary of district superintendents in the State to $3,250. The 
maximum salary is $7,000. This amount is received by district super- 
intendents in two counties. Each superintendent also receives $600 
from the State for traveling expenses. 
Additions to the State rural supervisory staffs are reported from 
California, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee, and Virginia. Ad- 
ditional counties brought under supervision during the period are 
reported from California, Florida, Maryland, Michigan, Arkansas, 
Washington, Pennsylvania, and Tennessee. In all, approximately 
200 supervisors in addition to those reported in 1922 are reported to 
the Bureau of Education. It is estimated that there are about 1,200 
rural supervisors in the United States. 
RURAL SUPERVISION AND STATE EDUCATION DEPARTMENTS 
In-service training for superintendents—A number of States in 
which assistant supervisors to the county superintendents are not yet 
furnished find in State and regional conferences of rural superin- 
tendents an. opportunity to carry on an intensive type of in-service 
training in instructional supervision. Provision for teacher training 
in service is an acknowledged administrative necessity. A similar 
arrangement for superintendents and supervisors is proving particu-
-P-A-G-E-77
RURAL EDUCATION 43 
larly valuable, especially in view of the fact that it is extremely 
probable that some time will pass before any considerable proportion 
of rural superintendents will be adequately trained for supervision 
through graduate courses in higher institutions. 
In recognition of the practical difficulties of the situation, the 
conferences of rural superintendents have been undergoing a grad- 
ual change in recent years. Those in which the bulk of the time was 
devoted to inspirational and informational addresses and general dis- 
cussions are gradually being superseded by conferences of one or 
two weeks’ duration and what may be termed short courses in the 
principles and methods of instructional supervision. Instructors 
who have special training for, and experience in, school supervision 
are brought into these conferences from without as well as from 
within the State. The courses resemble in quality and professional 
standards those given in summer sessions in normal schools and other 
higher institutions. Paralleling the change in type of work given, 
sessions are extended over a longer period. Montana, Oklahoma, and 
Minnesota are among those States which make special mention of im- 
proved standards of county superintendents’ conferences for the bi- 
ennium. Twenty-two States report some form of county superin- 
tendents’ conferences. 
CENTRALIZING TENDENCIES IN ADMINISTRATIVE ORGANIZA- 
TION FOR EFFICIENCY AND ECONOMY 
Recognition of the utter inadequacy of small administrative units 
to meet the demands of modern educational ideals: and a growing 
desire for efficiency and economy in school administration are ‘gov- 
erning factors underlying the movement for greater pooling of 
effort in educational support and school administration. 
Centralizing movements affecting local school units conspicuous 
during the biennium are: 
(1) The movement to provide on a State-wide scale and through 
legislative action, for an administrative unit large enough to afford © 
more nearly adequate support and a complete educational unit of 
elementary and secondary facilities with professional management, 
supervision, and teaching staff. The county as the unit of organiza- 
tion is now established in varying degrees of centralization in 22 
States. The movement is both (a) to strengthen it by increasing 
powers and duties of the county board and superintendent in those 
States where such strengthening would add to efficiency; and (6) to 
establish the county unit in several States now organized on the 
district or township plan. Kentucky and Virginia are two States 
which have taken definite steps during the biennium to strengthen 
 
-P-A-G-E-78
  74 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1922-1924 
the county organization in vogue, Kentucky by changing the manner 
of election and lengthening the term of members of the county 
board of education, and Virginia by stimulating county boards of 
education to exercise more authority and participate more fully in 
the management of schools within their county. 
In at least 10 States adoption of the county unit plan has been ad- 
vocated extensively, fostered by education officials generally, State 
school officials, State education organizations or others. Among 
them are Missouri, Wisconsin, Texas, Colorado, Arizona, Minne- 
sota, Oklahoma, Washington, and Indiana. In some States drives or 
campaigns designed “to inform the people” have been conducted 
on a State-wide scale. (¢) Some consideration has been given also 
to another plan not yet tested in any State but advocated in New 
York for the past four years. It is generally known as the com- 
munity unit plan. Proposed legislation for Kansas involved a type 
of community unit. None of the States that advocated the adoption 
of either county or community plan were successful in securing the 
legislation sought. 
(2) The movement for voluntary centralization on the part of 
small local units generally known as consolidation. 
TENDENCIES IN SCHOOL CONSOLIDATIONS 
Reports coming into the Bureau of Education for 1923-24 con- 
cerning general progress in the direction of bringing small schools 
together to form larger ones indicate that the emphasis has veered 
from numbers to the more fundamental consideration of efficiency. 
Intelligent direction is replacing promotion. Consolidation in and 
of itself is not a panacea for the ills of rural education. Its virtue 
is potential. Transferring from the one-teacher to the consolidated 
school the same short term, unqualified teachers, lack of professional 
management, equipment, and the like, changing only the size of 
building and number of children to be educated under one roof, has 
little to recommend it from an educational standpoint. Consolida- 
tion has possibilities and offers opportunities—is a means to an end. 
Full development of possibilities and full realization of opportuni- 
ties afforded must be sought in order to insure the success of the 
plan. Among the tendencies noticeable in the direction of increased 
efficiency, the following are worthy of special mention: 
(a) Scientific study of special problems.—The growing practice 
of employing administrators and teachers with professional prepa- 
ration including graduate study is responsible for increased em- 
phasis on the necessity for scientific study of the organization, 
curriculum, and practice adapted to the needs of consolidated schools.
-P-A-G-E-79
  RURAL EDUCATION 1D 
Several consolidated schools have been established or their direc- 
tion assumed by teacher-preparing institutions in cooperation with 
the regular officials in charge. It is purposed to use these schools 
for observation and practice work primarily but also for experi- 
mentation and demonstration. i 
(0) Larger units of consolidation —Mounting costs of education, 
especially of secondary education, have hastened a tendency toward 
consolidation on a larger scale than has hitherto been considered 
desirable. Improvements in roads, in motor vehicles, and in trans- 
portation generally have promoted this tendency. 
(c) Consideration. of future development—tThere is a growing 
realization of the necessity of considering future development when 
centralization plans are projected. Intelligent planning in advance 
over a larger extent of territory and considering the education of 
larger numbers of children will, it is believed, facilitate the for- 
mation of each consolidation unit in such a way that it will fit into 
and contribute to the success of the larger plan. It should not be 
difficult to avoid mistakes, common in some sections, of leaving 
strips of territory or even whole districts so isolated that advan- 
tageous centralization in the future is impossible. There is a notice- 
able tendency to postpone the first steps toward consolidation until 
surveys county-wide, or even larger in extent, can be made. 
(d) Improving the small schools—The tendency is increasing to 
improve one-teacher schools where consolidation is impossible. There 
is no incompatibility between promoting at the same time the 
efficiency of the two most prevalent types of rural schools, namely, 
one-teacher and consolidated. Small schools, not only the one- 
teacher type but the two and three teacher types, will undoubtedly 
continue to decrease in number and in the percentage of total num- 
ber of children enrolled. There is little probability, however, that 
such schools will be entirely eliminated in the near future. Thou- 
sands of rural children must depend on the small schools for all 
the education they will receive. We are therefore obligated to con- 
tinue every possible effort to improve them as well as the larger ones. 
Amount and extent of school consolidation —The movement to in- 
crease the size of the school units, buildings, and groups of children, 
and to improve thereby the quality of instruction of rural children 
is not confined to any State or section. Some consolidated schools 
and some one-teacher schools are found in all States. The largest 
numbers of one-teacher schools, apparently, are in those States which 
center around the region of the Great Lakes. In each of the follow- 
ing States there are more than 5,000 one-teacher schools: Wisconsin, 
Illinois, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New York; Minnesota, 
Iowa, Nebraska, Kansas, and Missouri; Kentucky, and West Vir-  
-P-A-G-E-80
  76 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1922-1024 
ginia. The single exception in the Great Lake group is Indiana. 
Iowa, Illinois, and Pennsylvania have approximately 9,000 each. 
So far as numbers are concerned, the problem of eliminating the one- 
teacher schools and substituting consolidated schools is greater in 
these States than in the others. It must be remembered that numbers 
alone afford only one measure either of the difficulty of the 
problem or of the success of the consolidation plan. Information 
concerning the percentage of children enrolled in the different types 
of schools and the relationship of enrollment to the number of 
schools is not available. It is apparent that in the States in the above 
group the percentage of the total number of children attending one- 
teacher schools is large. Massachusetts, Utah, New Jersey, and 
Rhode Island of all the States enroll the smallest percentage of their 
children in one-teacher schools. 
Estimates made in the Bureau of Education, based on reports 
from the different States and information from questionnaires re- 
ceived from State and county superintendents, indicate that there 
were at the close of 1924 approximately 14,000 consolidated schools 
of all sizes from two teacher schools, representing the union of 
small groups, to the large consolidated districts served in some in- 
stances by large high schools and even junior college grades. Prob- 
ably about 150,000 teachers are employed in these schools, and two 
and three-fourths millions of children are enrolled. Approximately 
1,500 consolidated schools have been formed during the biennial 
period, probably adding between 250,000 and 500,000 children to the 
number enrolled in consolidated schools. Thirty-five States report 
on the number of schools formed during the period. Arkansas, 
Mississippi, Texas, Pennsylvania, Georgia, North Carolina, and 
Ohio report the largest numbers, varying from 75 in Texas to over 
300 in Mississippi and Ohio. 
Additional estimates made in the Bureau of Education show that 
there are approximately 168,000 one-teacher schools in the United 
States, enrolling approximately four and three-fourths million chil- 
dren. Other types of schools enrolling rural children are one, two, 
and three teacher schools in the open country, village schools, and 
schools located in towns of 1,000 population and under. On the 
whole, it is estimated that approximately 12,000,000 children in the 
United States, properly called rural, are enrolled in the different 
types of schools, and that approximately 9,000,000 are from farm 
homes. 
The number of consolidations formed, considered alone, is not an 
adequate measure of the progress of the consolidation movement. 
Improvement in the quality of education furnished—the real desid- 
eratum—does not always parallel growth in the number of con-
-P-A-G-E-81
  RURAL EDUCATION Ki 
solidated school buildings. There are States in which relatively few 
consolidated schools have been established, but these few are large 
schools, adequately supported and equipped, and with professionally 
prepared and well-paid. staffs. On the other hand, a large number 
of small one and two teacher schools, in which terms are short, 
teachers neither well qualified nor well paid, and equipment meager, 
are reported as consolidations. The data as to number of schools are 
believed to be of interest, but it is not the purpose of the statement to 
set up numbers as the sole measure of progress in consolidation. 
Recent studies concerning the location of consolidated schools as 
between open country and villages indicate that more schools are 
situated in villages than in the open country, although there is no 
evidence to show that either is the more favorable except from the 
point of view of local considerations. 
Increase in numbers of consolidated schools has not been so great 
during the present biennium as during the preceding one. Progress, 
however, has probably been more substantial. The size of the schools 
organized, the general improvement in facilities, the fact that larger 
units mean better support, and the increased tendency to place 
consolidated schools or systems under trained professional manage- 
ment have all tended toward improving the quality of school con- 
solidations formed. 
Obstacles to overcome.—Recent reports from a number of per- 
sons who are promoting school consolidation indicate that natural 
obstacles, such as contour and topography, hitherto considered as 
the most serious obstacles in the way of the extension of consolida- 
tion, are of less importance than they seemed in the early history 
of the movement. There is a fairly general agreement among these 
workers that the attitude of the people concerned toward education 
and toward modern ideas; the type of organization under which 
the schools are administered; and the ability of communities to se- 
cure from local, State, and county funds the money required to prop- 
erly finance efficient schools are the real governing factors. In some 
sections, the traditional conservatism of farm people renders them 
unfavorable to radical changes and probable increases in the expense 
of maintaining schools. Certain farm organizations oppose the 
extension of the consolidation movement. In other sections the 
people are converted to the idea but are unable to finance larger 
and better schools until a new and better system of school support 
is developed for State, county, and district. In those States in which 
the administrative unit is the district or township, the crossing of 
established boundary lines creates difficulties. In several of these 
States laws requiring a favorable majority vote in each of the con- 
tributing units before a consolidation can be effected make it pos- 
27301°—27—_6 
 
-P-A-G-E-82
    
78 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1922-1924 
sible for a small group to obstruct the desires of the majority in the 
larger group of which it is a part. 
Transportation —Development in transportation has paralleled 
that of the consolidation movement, in general, during the bien- 
nial period. The tendency toward larger units has indeed made it 
necessary to give even more attention to the transportation phase 
of consolidated school management. Children are transported 
longer distances. Vehicles are made larger in order to accommo- 
date more children, and they are of a better type. Manufacturing 
companies producing transportation vehicles are studying seating 
arrangements, placement and operation of doors, and other means 
whereby greater safety may be assured. The general increase in 
motor transportation in cities as well as for suburban and interurban 
purposes has accelerated progress in this. 
The improvement in roads fostered by National, State, and local 
governments has added to the ease of transportation. Because of 
the increased mileage in hard-surfaced roads, wagons and small auto 
trucks are rapidly being superseded by large motor trucks. More 
children can be transported over longer distances; the time on the 
road between home and school is shorter; and consolidations cover- 
ing a far larger extent of territory are feasible. 
The greatest advance, however, has come through the systematic 
administration and operation of school transportation vehicles. 
Careful management as to cost, upkeep, efficiency, and the like have 
reduced expenses and added to the sense of responsibility felt by 
school officials and bus operators. 
It has become generally recognized that transportation is a most 
important factor in the success of consolidated schools, and that 
safety is largely a matter of administrative management. Responsi- 
bility, which formerly centered in school boards and drivers em- 
ployed by them either on a contract or salary basis, has-now been 
centralized in the administrative officer, the principal or the super- 
intendent, with considerable gain in efficiency and economy. 
Complete data concerning the number of children transported and 
the amount of money spent on transportation concerned with schools 
are not available. An estimate based on reports from 32 States re- 
garding the number of children transported and from 46 States 
concerning amounts spent for transportation apparently justify the 
estimate that in 1924 more than a million children were transported 
regularly at an expense of approximately $30,000,000. 
TENDENCIES IN SECONDARY EDUCATION FOR RURAL CHILDREN 
For the first time the rural high school has been studied on a 
national scale in the Bureau of Education during the biennial period
-P-A-G-E-83

1922-1924. For the first time, through summaries of studies now 
completed, the essential characteristics of the rural high school can 
be shown, the extent to which farm children are participating in 
secondary education pointed out, and an analysis made of selected 
factors in their effect upon participation of farm children in 
secondary education. Conclusions gleaned from studies referred to 
are set forth at some length in the Rural High School, by Dr. Emery 
N. Ferriss, of Cornell University (U. S. Bureau of Education, Bul- 
letin, 1925, No. 10); and in High School Education of the Farm 
Population in Selected States, by E. E. Windes, Associate Specialist 
in Rural Education (U. S. Bureau of Education, Bulletin, 1925,

I. A QUARTER CENTURY’S PROGRESS IN MEDICAL EDUCATION 
A review of the previous reports on medical education, together 
with the statements presented herewith, will show that since 1900 a 
vigorous campaign has been successfully carried on for the improve- 
ment of medical education in this country. A better understanding 
of the conditions now existing can be obtained through a brief re- 
- view of the development of medical schools since 1800. As shown in 
Chart 1, since 1800 the number of medical schools increased more 
rapidly than the population. From 4 medical schools in 1800 for 
5,000,000 people, in 1860 the number had increased to 66 for 31,- 
000,000. During the 5 years covered by the Civil War, 20 medical 
schools ceased to éxist or were suspended, thereby reducing the num- 
ber to 46. Following the Civil War, however, the medical schools 
multiplied very rapidly, so that by 1900 there were 160 for 75,000,000 
people. : 
With the rapid increase in the numbers of medical schools there 
was a correspondingly rapid increase in the number of medical stu- 
dents and in the numbers who were graduated each year. Figures 
in regard to students and graduates are available only since 1880. 
For the 100 medical colleges existing in 1880 there were 11,826 stu- 
dents, an average of 118 per college, and 3,241 graduates, an average 
of 32 for each college. In 1904, however, when the maximum num- 
ber of students and graduates had been reached, there were 160 medi- 
cal colleges which enrolled 28,142 students and graduated 5,747. 
The population in 1904 was approximately 82,000,000, people.

Although the number of medical colleges has been reduced, the average size and capacity has been 
increased. The largest number of medical schools was 162in 1906; the largest numbers of students and 
graduates were in 1904 (figures in italics). The lowest number of medical colleges since 1871 was 79 in 
1924; the lowest number of students was in 1919 and of medical graduates in 1922. 
INADEQUATE GOVERNMENTAL CONTROL OVER MEDICAL EDUCATION 
In this country the control of medical education and practice was 
left by the National Constitution to the police powers of the vari- 
ous States, a function which, if assumed at all by the States, was 
only to a limited and inadequate extent. In only a few States have 
efficient regulations been established over the chartering of educa- 
tional institutions; and therefore no legal regulations were made in 
regard to essential buildings, finances, teachers, or equipment which 
a medical school should possess; and as a consequence the majority 
of medical schools established were of an inferior type.

ACTION BY A VOLUNTARY AGENCY 
In the absence of adequate legal control, the agency best qualified 
to recognize the serious deficiencies in medical education was the 
medical profession, and at different times prior to 1900 investigations 
and reports in regard to these conditions were made by special com-
-P-A-G-E-88
  
84 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1922-1924 
mittees of the American Medical Association. These had little 
effect other than to aid in stimulating a few States to create licensing 
boards and to begin some regulation of medical schools. The most 
effective work of this kind was that of the Illinois State Board of 
Health, during the secretaryship of John H. Rauch, as described in 
a previous report.t’ For 15 years that board exerted the only power- 
ful and nation-wide influence toward improvement in medical 
schools and in the closing of a score or more of notorious diploma 
mills in various parts of the country. In 1892 a change of adminis- 
tration in Tlinois brought with it a sweeping change in the person- 
nel of that board, including its able secretary, only one member of 
the former board remaining. Not only the forces for improve- 
ment but also the restrictions against institutions of low grade and 
of doubtful character were at once removed, and the country relapsed 
into another period in which low-grade medical schools were un- 
hindered in their activity. 
LEGAL POWER UV. PUBLICITY 
Beginning in 1900 the statistics collected and published in the 
Journal of the American Medical Association started a campaign 
for improvement, and in 1904 the association created a permanent 
council to exert continuous and persistent efforts toward that end. 
The work of this council, with its series of annual conferences, inspec- 
tions and classifications of medical schools, the securing of mergers 
of two or more medical schools in each of many cities, and the recom- 
mending of higher entrance standards—all of this is now history. 
In 1910 the entry of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement 
of Teaching into the campaign not only obtained additional pub- 
licity to the campaign but also. attracted the attention of philan- 
thropists to the financial needs of medical education. The details 
of this campaign are given in greater detail in previous reports. By 
1910 the number of medical schools had been reduced, mostly through 
mergers, from 160 to 95, the number of students from 28,142 to 
12,930, and the number of graduates from 5,747 to 2,656. By 1924 
the number of medical colleges was further reduced to 80, but the 
number of students had again increased to 17,728 and the number 
of graduates to 3,562. As a result of the improvements, however, 
74 of the medical schools were in every way greatly improved insti- 
tutions, and, of the students, 98 per cent were enrolled in these 
higher institutions, which also turned out 97 per cent of those who 
were graduated each year. In brief, the colleges had been reduced 
to half the former number, but the numbers of well-trained and 
qualified students and graduates had been tremendously increased.

It is interesting to note, also, that the number of students enrolled 
since the lowest ebb in 1919 has been increased by an average of 
1,000 per year, nearly all of which have been trained in medical 
schools which in every way have been greatly improved.

GREATLY ENLARGED TEACHING PLANTS 
A marvelous development in the construction of large medical 
teaching plants has occurred during the past 15 years. Beginning 
with the large teaching plants for Johns Hopkins and Harvard, 
the wave of construction moved rapidly forward through both State 
and private medical schools until, in 1920, large teaching plants had 
been constructed in a score or more of medical schools. Among 
these are the medical schools of the State Universities of California, 
Georgia, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, and Vir- 
ginia; and among the private institutions were Chicago, Cincinnati, 
Jefferson, Pennsylvania, Rush, Stanford, Washington, and Yale. 
New but individual buildings were erected in about a score of others. 
More recently, greatly enlarged teaching plants have been con- 
structed by the Universities of Colorado, Illinois, Ohio, Rochester 
(N. Y.), St. Louis, Vanderbilt, Western Reserve, and Wisconsin; and 
others are now in course of construction, or have been planned for 
early completion, at Chicago, Columbia, Iowa, and Northwestern - 
Universities. The marvelous wave of improvements in the standards 
of medical education, therefore, has been followed by an equally 
marvelous period of construction of new and larger teaching plants. 
HOSPITALS AS RELATED TO MEDICAL EDUCATION 
Along with better buildings, better finances, improved labora- 
tories, and more expert teachers, came also the necessity for closer 
relationships with hospitals, whereby the students under the super- 
vision of other physicians could secure valuable experience by ob- 
serving the examination and treatment of the sick in hospitals and

dispensaries. At the beginning of the nineteenth century there were, 
of course, comparatively few hospitals; and, as the number of 
medical schools increased, few of them were fortunate enough to 
have hospital connections. During the last 25 years, however, the 
numbers have been greatly increased. In 1912 there were approxi- 
mately 2,500 hospitals in the United States, whereas in 1924 the

number had increased to over 7,000. As the numbers have increased, 
better relations have been established between hospitals and medical 
schools, so that now every reputable medical school has a close re- 
lationship with one or more hospitals and is providing its students 
with a valuable training in the observation of, and assistance in, 
the examination and care of the sick,
-P-A-G-E-91
MEDICAL EDUCATION 87 
HOSPITAL INTERNESHIPS 
During the past three decades, attention of the recent graduate has 
been increasingly attracted to the great value of spending an addi- 
tional year or two as an interne in a large hospital, where he has an 
opportunity to apply his medical knowledge while still under super- 
vision and before he enters on an independent practice. In 1912 there 
were not enough hospitals using internes to provide places for all 
graduates. With the improvements in medical schools, and the greatly 
improved qualifications of modern medical graduates, however, 
their services became of greater value to the hospitals and the demand 
for internes was greatly increased. At the same time, the number and 
size of hospitals were greatly increased, which provided additional 
places. At present, therefore, the demand for internes would exceed 
the supply, even if the numbers graduating each year should be 
doubled. The great value of the hospital interne training is that the 
graduate has an opportunity to secure experience in the care of sick 
people while he is still under observation, so that any errors will be 
corrected without injury to the patients. Before these hospital in- 
terneships were available, the graduate had to secure the experience 
in his own active practice without any safeguards in cases of error. 
It is gratifying to state, however, that the ill results in the care of 
patients were extremely few in spite of the lack of the opportunity 
for interne training. The number of hospitals seeking internes is now 
sufficiently large to warrant a requirement in all States that medical 
graduates should not be licensed to practice their profession unless 
they have completed an interneship in a general hospital. 
THE HOSPITAL AN IMPORTANT EDUCATIONAL FACTOR 
An interneship in a general hospital has now come to be recognized, 
not only as a rounding-out process for the training of the general 
pwactitioner, but also as the basis for graduate medical work leading 
to a higher degree of knowledge and skill in the various specialities. 
In other words, an interneship in a general hospital now occupies an 
important zone separating undergraduate from graduate medical 
education. As hospitals are increasing in number, so also are they 
developing as an important factor in medical and public health 
education. Besides their value in the education of medical students, 
nurses, and internes, they are also places where physicians ‘can secure 
a higher degree of training as a specialist in some clinical field, 
such as in skin diseases, surgery, internal medicine, children’s diseases, 
or in diseases of the eye, ear, nose, and throat or some other speciality. 
They are also important ia their communities as educational centers, 
not only for the higher instruction of the physicians in the neigh- 
borhood, but also through their patients, nurses, and others, as a 
means of keeping the people of the community informed in regard  
-P-A-G-E-92
    88 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1922-1924 
to matters relating to infant welfare, public health, and disease 
prevention. 
Il. NEWER PROBLEMS IN MEDICAL EDUCATION 
As a direct result of the great changes and improvements in medi- 
cal education, newer problems have been developed. Among these 
may be mentioned the higher cost of medical education, an over- 
crowded medical curriculum, an unusual rush into specialization by 
recent graduates, the elaborate equipment required for the prac- 
tice of modern medicine, and the decreased number of physicians in 
rural communities as compared with the increasing proportion of 
physicians in the cities. 
HIGHER COST OF MEDICAL EDUCATION 
Prior to 1900, with only a few exceptions, medical schools were 
maintained entirely on the fees obtained from students, and some 
could still pay out dividends after all expenses were paid. As 
medical schools were developed, however, the costs were enormously 
increased. The larger buildings, with the correspondingly larger 
expenses for heat, light, and care; the several essential and better 
equipped laboratories; the larger numbers of skilled teachers, many 
of whom necessarily devoted their entire time to teaching; the 
special and highly technical apparatus; the maintenance of library 
and museum; the more elaborate curriculum, with the higher costs of 
administration—the cost of all these required a higher income than 
could be obtained from students’ fees alone. To provide a training 
in accordance with the present wide knowledge of the causes, recog- 
nition, treatment, and prevention of diseases, the medical schools 
must now have, in addition to students’ fees, incomes from either 
State appropriations or private endowment. 
An investigation covering the college year of 1914-15 showed tPat 
the average income of each college was $68,277, of which $23,795 
was from students’ fees, and the average of expenditures was $66,253. 
The average cost of instruction per student in that year was $419, 
whereas he paid in tuition fees only $150. In brief, it cost three 
times as much to teach a medical student as he paid in tuition fees. 
For the session of 1920-21 an investigation showed that the average 
cost of instruction for each student increased to $655, whereas the 
average fee paid by each student had increased to only $185. The 
average income of each medical school was $130,672, including 
$35,135 from students’ fees. The average expenditure by each col- 
lege was $123,947, of which $46,162 was for full-time teachers; 
$21,131 for part-time teachers; $19,068 for wages of clerks, jani- 
tors, etc, ; and $36,974 for maintenance and supplies,

To offset these greatly increased costs of furnishing medical educa- 
tion, great sums have been donated by the large educational founda- 
tions, private donors, and State legislatures; so that, where formerly 
gifts of more than a few thousand dollars were very rare, in later 
years the gifts of from many hundred thousands to a few millions 
became so frequent as to be considered a matter of course. 
SCHOLARSHIPS AND LOAN FUNDS 
The requirements for admission to medical schools have been in- 
creased since 1912, from a high-school education or less, to two or 
more years of college work. This increased time requirement, as 
well as the higher tuition fees in medical schools, has added con- 
siderably to the time and expense of obtaining a medical education. 
So far as the student is able to do so, it is reasonable to expect him 
to pay at least a fair portion of the amount necessary to provide him 
with that training. There always has been, however, a considerable 
number of students who do not have sufficient money to pay tuition 
fees and are struggling to secure a medical training. As a rule, 
also, this group of students contains many who have unusual quali- 
fications and ability, and from this group in times past many physi- 
cians of high attainments have come. As the educational standards 
and costs of medical education have advanced, more scholarships 
and loan funds for the aid of such students have been established. 
At the present time, 576 scholarships are reported in 46 medical 
schools. Each of these scholarships is available only once in four 
years; so that only 144 are available each year. Loan funds are also 
available in 31 medical schools. 
The present-day medical curriculum is much more severe than it 
was 20 years ago, which makes it much more difficult for a student 
to earn money at the same time he is studying medicine. Neverthe- 
less, many students are still reported to be earning a major portion 
of their expenses during their medical school time. It is a question, 
however, whether the money so earned is not at the expense of much 
valuable experience which they otherwise might have and should have 
obtained. It is during the student’s medical course, while he is under 
able instructors, that he has the best opportunity of his lifetime to 
study and observe diseases of patients in both dispensary and hos- 
pital. In order to make the best use of this opportunity, therefore,
-P-A-G-E-94
  90 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1922-1924 
it would be far better for the student to borrow money with which 
to meet his expenses or to have the advantage of a free scholarship. 
A more worthy object for those who have money to give could not 
be found than in the endowment of more of these scholarships, or 
the establishing of additional loan funds. In granting these, how- 
ever, proper safeguards should be established so that they will be 
used only for students who not only have high scholarly ability, but 
also are actually in need of financial aid. 
THE MEDICAL CURRICULUM. 
Prior to 1900 little concern was felt regarding the course of 
instruction, because few of the medical schools had developed their 
curricula in accordance with the unprecedented expansion of medical 
knowledge since the time of Pasteur. With the improvements in 
medical schools since 1900, however, new subjects were rapidly added 
to the medical curriculum, until it soon became seriously over- 
crowded. So important became this problem that, in 1908, a special 
committee of 100 prominent medical educators was appointed by the 
Council on Medical Education to make a special study and to present 
a report? recommending a model medical curriculum. This com- 
mittee was made up of subcommittees covering the 10 departments 
of medical teaching, including both the laboratory and clinical 
subjects. The original plan was to prepare a curriculum consist- 
ing of 900 hours each year, or 3,600 hours for the four years, but 
when the subcommittees’ reports were presented in 1909, they 
called for a total of 4,400 hours. These reports were accompanied 
by a recommendation, however, that the total be cut down by the 
colleges to 4,000 hours. ‘ 
This report doubtless brought some improvements, but the cur- 
riculum continued to be overcrowded, and groups representing 
certain subjects continued to clamor for larger numbers of teaching 
hours. It became evident, also, that in the teaching of the clinical 
subjects very rare or highly complicated conditions were being un- 
duly emphasized at the expense of the basic principles of diagnosis 
and treatment, which were of greater importance to the student. 
The emphasis laid on special operations also induced graduates, 
without further special study, to begin immediately the practice of 
some specialty. 
GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION 
It is now well recognized that the chief function of the under- 
graduate curriculum is to furnish a basic training for general prac- 
titioners. Then should follow the hospital interneship, which would 
round out and complete the physician’s training as a general prac- 
titioner and not further lure him into some specialty before he has

-P-A-G-E-95
  
  MEDICAL EDUCATION 91 
secured the essential additional training. The exceptional types 
of diseases, and the highly technical and complicated forms of treat- 
ment, should come after the completion of the general hospital 
interneship, in special hospitals or in the graduate medical school. 
The development of graduate medical schools during the past 10 
years is helping to solve the curriculum problem, in that a place has 
been found for certain courses which are better omitted from the 
undergraduate curriculum. The students of some graduate medical 
schools aid in the teaching of undergraduate students, who are 
thereby made familiar with the routine of securing a higher train- 
ing before they can be qualified for practice in any special field. 
They learn also where and how the higher training can be obtained, 
and by observing the work of the graduate students can note the 
character of that work. 
The graduate medical school, therefore, has helped in the solu- 
tion of three problems in modern medical education: (a) It has 
aided in an improvement of the medical curriculum in the clearer 
understanding established as to what subjects belong in the under- 
graduate department; (6) it has helped to stop an inadvised rush 
of recent graduates into specialization by transferring the sub- 
jects which have stimulated this tendency from the undergraduate 
to the graduate school curriculum; and (ec) better facilities have 
been provided in the graduate medical schools where graduates can 
develop the higher knowledge and skill essential for the practice of 
the specialty selected. 
Meanwhile, gradual improvements are being made in graduate 
medical education in this country. Inspections of the various 
graduate and postgraduate medical schools which were made by a 
committee of the American Medical Association in 1916 and 1919 
showed that conditions were decidedly unsatisfactory. While a few 
of these schools were well conducted, in the others the work was 
unorganized and poorly graded; little or no attention was paid to 
the character or qualifications of the physician-student, and prac- 
tically no record was kept aside from his payment of fees. Never- 
theless, some of the schools granted pretentious diploma-like certifi- 
cates for some courses of instruction extending over no more than 
one or two weeks. By 1923, however, through the suggestions given 
out during the previous inspections, conditions were considerably 
improved, and most of the postgraduate medical schools had ceased 
to grant certificates except for courses of six months or more. 
In 1920, in order to secure a basis for the approval of graduate 
medical schools, 15 special committees were appointed to recommend 
what preparation was deemed essential to establish proficiecy in 
each of the 15 specialties to which they were assigned. Their report 
was presented at the annual conference on medical education in
-P-A-G-E-96
  92 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1922—1924 
Chicago in 1921.2. The committees were unanimous in their decision 
that an interneship in a general hospital was not only essential to 
round out the education of the general practitioner, but also should 
be the foundation on which further training in the various special- 
ties should be based. 
Following a third inspection made in 1923, a schedule of principles 
regarding graduate medical education was prepared which provided 
for admission requirements, records, supervision, curriculum, graded 
instruction, qualified teachers, properly equipped laboratories, library 
and museum facilities, essential hospital and outpatient material, 
annual announcements, and regulations in regard to the granting of 
degrees and diploma-like certificates. On the basis of these prin- 
ciples, out of 35 institutions investigated, a list of only 15 approved 
graduate medical schools was prepared. Since 1923, however, 19 
other institutions have been added, making a total at the present time 
of 34. To this list has been added 16 hospitals in which, through a 
higher interneship or residency, a physician can perfect himself in 
the practice of some specialty. 
Where in 1916 only 20 postgraduate schools were offering courses 
of unknown quality and quantity, there are now 50 institutions giv- 
ing courses that have been investigated and found worthy of ap- 
proval. A list of medical subjects has also been prepared, after each 
of which is given the names of graduate medical schools or hospitals 
in which opportunity for higher training in that subject or specialty 
can be obtained. The physician, therefore, is now provided with a 
carefully prepared list of graduate schools from which he can make 
an intelligent selection. As time goes on, an even greater use will 
be made of tlie abundance of hospital and dispensary patients in 
providing opportunities for physicians to perfect themselves in. the 
practice of their profession and thereby render a better care to the 
people coming to them for treatment. 
LIMITATION OF ENROLLMENTS 
During the improvement of medical education, medical schools 
found it necessary to limit the enrollment in their classes so that 
better supervision could be given to the student’s individual work, 
and the results have shown the wisdom of such action. This limita- 
tion, however, coupled with the unprecedented rush of students into

medical schools, increased the difficulty of well-qualified students in 
securing enrollment in medical schools. After having applied to one 
medical school after another and securing the reply that their classes 
were full, a student would send a letter simultaneously to a score 
or more of the remaining institutions. As a result he would be 
enrolled by two or more medical schools, although when the session 
began he could attend only one. This practice resulted in vacancies 
which otherwise might have been filled. Following the opening of 
the session of 1924-25, an investigation showed that after all regis- 
trations were completed, 1,355 vacancies still remained. Some of 
these students had registered and actually paid matriculation fees 
at two or more medical schools. Thus the capacity of medical 
schools is still adequate although some qualified students ‘were 
temporarily debarred. The Class A medical schools report that, 
without much difficulty or expense, they can provide capacity for 
an additional 5,000 students. Our well-equipped colleges should 
soon provide more space, or other high-grade medical colleges 
should be established. Properly qualified students show a laudable 
desire to enter well-established medical schools, since it is this type 
of medical school, rather than the lower type, in which the enroll- 
ments are first filled. 
SPECIALIZATION IN MEDICINE 
In the past 50 years the exact knowledge of the recognition, treat- 
ment, and prevention of diseases has increased more than in all 
previous ages. This increase is but a parallel to the marvelous de- 
velopments in other fields of knowledge and experience, all of which 
have occurred during the same time. With this expansion of medi- 
cal knowledge and the multiplication of the methods and agencies 
for the diagnosis and treatment of diseases, it is but natural that 
physicians in increasing numbers should desire to limit their prac- 
tice within the narrow bounds of some specialty in medicine. Such, 
indeed, is necessary if a physician expects to develop the highest 
degree of knowledge and skill in any specialty. That many physi- 
cians are specializing is but a parallel to what is done in other pro- 
fessions. Among engineers, for example, there are now those who 
specialize in civil, electrical, aeronautical, mechanical, or chemical 
engineering; and in law there are those specializing in, or limiting 
their practice to, patents, wills, corporations, bankruptcies, or to 
civil, criminal, or divorce cases. 
With such specialization in medicine comes the importance of de- 
veloping as specialists those whe are highly skilled as diagnosticians 
and who are especially qualified to decide what particular form of 
treatment will best meet the patient’s needs. At present, this field 
is occupied largely by those referred to as specialists in “internal 
medicine” or “internists,” many of whom have demonstrated un- 
usual skill in diagnosis.

CHANGES IN GENERAL PRACTICE 
Several factors are leading to changes in the routine of medical 
practice. As the knowledge of medicine has been enormously in- 
creased, many valuable laboratory aids have been devised for the 
diagnosis and treatment of diseases. The advantage of being where 
all these aids are available thas led to a rapid increase in the number 
of patients seeking treatment in hospitals. The tendencies of the pub- 
lic also to seek specialists makes the hospital additionally advanta- 
geous, since its staff includes physicians representing the several 
specialities, and in unusually complicated cases the judgment of the 
group can be readily obtained. Hence, access to a hospital has come 
to be looked on, both by recent eeadint: and by the public, as very 
helpful if not essential for an up-to-date physician. 
This view of the public in regard to the hospital, coupled with 
the development of the automobile and cement roads, has induced 
many country people to go to city doctors and to the hospital for 
treatment. This in turn, has forced some of the country physicians 
likewise to move to the city. The future practice of medicine, 
therefore, calls for some arrangement whereby medical care will 
still be available even in the smaller and more remote rural districts. 
Just how these facilities can be provided still remains to be seen. The 
building of hospitals in all communities where there are people 
enough to maintain them will help. A suggestion has been made that 
physicians in the larger towns have office hours for a certain day 
or days of the week in smaller but near-by rural towns. Another 
suggestion is that health centers or clinics be provided in rural 
districts where first aid can be given in emergencies and, when 
necessary, ambulances can be secured promptly to transport a patient 
to the nearest hospital. 
CONCLUSION 
In 20 years medical education in the United States has under- 
gone a marvelous improvement, so that the medical schools of this 
country are at least on a par with those of other leading nations. The 
problems which remain are chiefly those due to the other improve- 
ments made. The greatest of all problems is how the benefits of the 
present-day knowledge of the cause, recognition, treatment, and pre- 
vention of diseases can be brought within the reach of the entire 
population, both from the standpoint of accessibility and cost. This 
problem is one of many other economic and sociological problems 
which have developed during the past few decades due to the rapidly 
changing conditions under which we are living. -Readjustments will 
be made under these conditions which will doubtless bring about 
the desired results,

INTRODUCTION 
Dentistry has evolved from medicine and more especially from 
the surgical aspect of what we now call medicine. Until the six- 
teenth century, physic and surgery were separate professions, and 
what we now call dentistry was a part of surgery rather than of 
physic. For centuries physic was a calling of greater dignity than 
surgery. Since the major influence in modern medicine has been 
physic rather than surgery, this legendary relation to some extent 
accounts for the fact that dentistry, since its establishment as a sepa- 
rate profession, has not been acknowledged to be on a professional 
parity with medicine. 
Dental education, in both Europe and America, was a part of 
medical education until 1840, but the dental features in medical edu- 
cation were only incidental, going little beyond some instruction on 
extraction. No sustained course of lectures on dental subjects was 
given in any medical school until 1837 and then in only one school. 
The better dentists were men who, following a medical education, 
had served an apprenticeship under a preceptor who was a dental 
practitioner, before they specialized in dentistry. 
With the establishment of the Baltimore College of Dental 
Surgery in 1840 separation of dentistry from medicine began, and 
the era of distinct institutional education in dentistry inaugurated 
a type of training in which the mechanical aspect of dental train- 
ing gradually supplanted the basic medical phase. However, train- 
ing through apprenticeship, either instead of the dental school 
course or supplementary to it, remained an important avenue of 
entrance to dentistry for several decades.

  96 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1922-1924 
In no instances was there any university control of, or interest in, 
dental education in its first 25 years. Inasmuch as for 50 years most 
of the dental schools were independent and proprietary, divorced 
from medical influence and lacking the broad principles that result 
from university control, dental education came to be mainly a train- 
ing in a technical art lacking the basis of general education and 
also devoid of adequate knowledge of the fundamental medical sub- 
jects. In this the profession and the dental schools took pride, and 
American dentistry came to excel in the mechanical phases. 
After, the Civil War there appeared in an increasing number of 
States statutory regulation of both medical and dental practice. 
This took the form of examinations before licensing boards, but 
these examinations were waived if an individual were a graduate 
of either type of professional school. In this policy of waiver arose 
the stimulus for organization of new dental schools, some of which 
were of little worth. During the 30 years from 1840 to 1869, in- 
clusive, 18 dental schools had been organized. Of these, 10 were in 
operation in 1870. During the 15 years from 1870 to 1884, inclusive, 
17 new schools were founded and 4 were discontinued, leaving 23 
schools in operation in 1884. In the 15 years from 1885 to 1899, 
inclusive, 57 new dental schools were organized and 29 were discon- 
tinued, leaving 51 dental schools in operation at the beginning of 
1900. There had been organized in 60 years 87 dental schools, some 
of which were scarcely more than diploma mills; many of them were 
happily short-lived. By 1885 the desirability of some regulatory 
control and standardization of dental schools was apparent. 
I, AGENCIES IN THE PROGRESS OF DENTAL EDUCATION 
The progress of dental education can not be properly compre- 
hended unless there is some understanding of the leading organized 
agencies that were factors in this progress, and therefore we shall 
briefly examine these in the chronological order of their appearance. 
1. AMERICAN DENTAL ASSOCIATION 
The practitioners of dentistry organized in 1859 the American 
Dental Association. Through committees it gave some attention to 
the problem of dental education, but this was a minor feature of 
the program which most interested its members. To them problems 
of practice were more compelling than problems of preparation of 
their successors for practice. 
This association, in response to the need for some regulation of 
dental education, in 1883 appointed a committee to arrange a con- 
ference of the executive officers of dental schools, and out of this 
conference arose the National Association of Dental Faculties in 
1884.
-P-A-G-E-101
  
  THE PROGRESS OF DENTAL EDUCATION 97 
Even in later years the American Dental Association has itself 
done little constructive educational work, but it has financially sup- 
ported the Dental Educational Council and thus by proxy has done 
a great educational service. 
2. NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF DENTAL EXAMINERS 
In 1883 the members of the licensing boards of several States 
formed the National Association of Dental Examiners. This later 
came to include the licensing boards of nearly every State. Its 
problems of licensure involve a consideration of education, and 
throughout its career it has shown a real interest in betterment of 
dental education. ‘In 1891 it appointed a committee for conference 
with the National Association of Dental) Faculties and frequently 
met in the same city as did that association, in order to facilitate 
adjudication of differences, for it early came. into conflict with the 
schools, especially with those proprietary schools which graduated 
deficiently trained men, 
3. THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF DENTAL FACULTIES 
In 1884 there were 23 dental schools in operation in the United 
States. Seven of the 30 that had been established had already suc- 
- cumbed. 
On August 4, 1884, 10 of these 23 schools united in the establish- 
ment of the National Association of Dental Faculties. Of these 10 
schools, 7 were independent and proprietary. 
The National Association of Dental Faculties was a potent factor 
in dental education from its organization in 1884 until its fusion into 
the Association of American Dental Colleges in 1923. In these 40 
years it did much, but it also failed to avail itself of the oppor- 
tunities to do more. The accomplishments of its earlier history are 
more to its credit than those of its later years. Throughout its 
existence the independent. schools dominated its policies. Some of 
them were, in name, affiliated with universities but in operation were 
proprietary. Initially, proprietary schools in the professions were 
necessary and served a real pioneer purpose at the time when dental 
education was ignored by most of the universities, but when in 
later years the independent schools have resisted advance in dental 
education they have become a hindrance. 
The primary interest of the proprietary schools, with a few miti- 
gating exceptions, has been to secure a large number of students. 
Since quality of graduates is nearly in inverse ratio to number of 
students, the improvement of quality has never been the primary 
object of proprietary schools.  
-P-A-G-E-102
  98 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1922-1924 
In its initial year the National Association of Dental Faculties 
recommended an increase in entrance requirements to include the 
elements of a good English education, which, from later develop- 
ments, was seen to mean less than the completion of the grammar 
school. It also recommended that the number of sessions be in- 
creased from two to three and that a graded curriculum be adopted 
to replace the repetitive curriculum, in which a student attended in 
his second year upon the same instruction that was given to new- 
comers and which he had attended the previous year. 
None of these recommendations was enforced upon the members 
of the association, and their value was academic rather than regu- 
latory, for more than a decade. Gradually this’ association made 
recommendations and finally regulations to govern its member 
schools, and with great travail moderate advances were made, but 
its ideals were so moderate that after some 20 years many of the 
schools controlled by universities withdrew from it, and left the 
independent schools with slight opposition in the association, with 
little contact with universities. 
Too large a part of the time and effort of the association was taken 
with regulations about the transfer of students from one school to 
another, based on the theory that the student was an asset of the 
school in which he had enrolled, and with discussions about ac- 
cepting students who did not meet the avowed entrance requirements. 
For 25 years this association gave its attention to matters of ad- 
ministration rather than to problems of teaching. Its name was a 
misnomer. It was not an association of faculties, but an associa- 
tion of deans and owners, and it gradually became decadent as the 
broad functions of dental education were fulfilled by other agencies. 
Historically, it is important in the first half of its existence but can 
claim little credit for the advances in dental education that have 
taken place in-the past 20 years. 
4, AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF DENTAL TEACHERS 
The policy of the National Association of Dental Faculties of 
ignoring all matters concerning pedagogy gave an invitation for 
formation of an association to consider such problems. In 1893, in 
connection with the Dental Congress at the Columbian Exposition in 
Chicago, 15 teachers, representing 11 dental schools, organized the 
National School of Dental Technics. The name was unfortunate. 
It was not a school, and it soon found that there were many other 
problems confronting dental teachers beside those in technics. In 
1898 its name was changed to the Institute of Dental Pedagogics, 
and in 1914 to the yet more descriptive name of American Institute 
of Dental Teachers,
-P-A-G-E-103
    
THE PROGRESS OF DENTAL EDUCATION 99 
This group of teachers gradually supplanted the National Asso- 
ciation of Dental Faculties as the leading agency for the advance 
of dental teaching. It was purely advisory, tried to enforce no rules, 
and abjured the question of finding some excuse for accepting de- 
ficient students. Also, since it was an association of dental teachers, 
rather than an association of owners of dental schools, it had no 
property rights to protect. This association of teachers received the 
- support of all the schools, including the university dental schools. 
The consideration of teaching problems for the period from 1893 
to 1908 was entirely taken over by the Institute of Dental Peda- 
gogics, where, from year to year, appeared very creditable papers 
usually freely discussed. At first these were confined to the teach- 
ing of dental technology, but gradually the field was widened until, 
in later years, the discussion of the curriculum as a whole began to 
appear, and finally those administrative problems which affect 
instruction. : 
With the Institute of Dental Pedagogics, later known as the 
American Institute of Dental Teachers, lies nearly all, if not all, 
the credit for whatever concerted effort there was, up to 1908, to 
improve the quality of teaching in the dental schools. 
5. DENTAL FACULTIES ASSOCIATION OF AMERICAN UNIVERSITIES 
The university dental schools began to withdraw from the Na- 
tional Association of Dental Faculties about 1900. Following its 
decision in 1903 to keep preliminary requirements below high-school 
graduation, still more of the university dental schools withdrew 
from that association. By 1908 the number of such schools had 
become enough to warrant organized effort, and in Boston on July 
81, 1908, representatives of 6 of the dental schools that were in- 
tegral parts of universities launched the Dental Faculties ‘Associa- 
tion of American Universities, which gradually increased its 
membership to 18 in 1923. This new association disavowed any 
effort at mandatory control by rules as to accepting students and 
devoted itself to the real educational problems influencing better- 
ment of the instruction within the dental school. In this it sup- 
plemented the work of the Institute of Dental Pedagogics, but. since 
its members were more nearly in sympathy than in the varied mem- 
bership of the institute, this new association was able to agree 
upon a concrete program of educational advance; and freed from 
financial interests and largely from dental politics, its accomplish- 
ments, though not widely heralded, were very substantial. The 
stimulus to the striking progress made by dental education in the 
past 10 years is largely due to the Association of Dental Faculties 
of American Universities.  
-P-A-G-E-104
  100 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1922-1924 
When the beneficent results of publicity of conditions regarding 
medical education came from the 1910 report on medical education 
by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, 
the university association of dental schools sought a similar survey 
and similar publicity regarding dental education by some outside 
agency. This was undertaken 10 years later. | 
6. THE DENTAL EDUCATIONAL COUNCIL OF AMERICA 
The National Association of Dental Examiners had been formed 
in 1883, a year before the National Association of Dental Faculties. 
Its purpose was to approach uniformity of procedure in the deter- 
mination of fitness to enter the practice of dentistry. Since each 
member of a State examining board is a public official, this associa- 
tion was supported by the power of the people as expressed through 
the statutes, and therefore had a status lacking in the voluntary 
association of schools. 
Besides this association and the National Association of Dental 
Faculties, there was the more inclusive association of dental practi- 
tioners, which, existing since 1859, came to include in its member- 
ship the large majority of dentists of the country. It was, and is, 
the most powerful body in dentistry. Its attention was given to 
organization, to the problems connected with practice, and to ad- 
vance in knowledge, technique, and methods in the various fields 
of dentistry. It later gave very definite help to the promotion 
of research. Somewhat incidentally it also gave attention to dental 
education through standing committees that furnished annual re- 
ports, often merely perfunctory, but sometimes with creditable 
recommendations. 
There were thus three associations each interested in dental edu- 
cation from a different viewpoint; one, that of the schools, interested 
in the details of carrying on such education; another, that of the 
examiners, interested in the graduates produced by such education 
in so far as they could or could not, with safety to the public, be 
licensed to practice; and the third, that of the dental practitioners, 
as such interested in the capability of the men who were to become 
their professional colleagues and competitors. 
For several years there had been suggestions of combined edu- 
cational effort by those three groups, and as a result, at Old Point 
Comfort, Va., on August 3, 1909, two committees of five each, one 
from the National Association of Dental Examiners, the other 
from the National Association of Dental Faculties, organized the 
Dental Educational Council of America. They invited the Na- 
tional Dental Association also to appoint 5 representatives, these 
three groups to form a joint committee of 15.
-P-A-G-E-105
  THE PROGRESS OF DENTAL EDUCATION 101 
The organization of this tripartite joint educational council 
marks the establishment of a powerful agency to advance dental 
education in this country. Potentially it was in position to bring 
early order out of the chaos in that field. 
The council organized for its work into three committees. One 
of these was on legislation; another committee was that on curricu- 
lum, charged with preparing a model course of study. Not until 
eight years later did this committee publish its first suggested stand- 
ard course of study, and this with no indication as to sequence 
of subjects. It has not yet taken up any really adequate study of 
the curriculum, which is a purely educational matter. In fact, the 
council has never seized the opportunities offered it to study and 
work out the questions relating to teaching and courses of instruc- 
tion; that is, the constructive educational aspects apart from the 
administrative phases. The committee which proved to be most 
active was that on colleges, the duties of which were to make visits 
to the dental schools, to ascertain their equipment and the char- 
acter of their work, including the enforcement of their avowed 
preliminary educational requirements. The initial program in- 
cluded the making of an early survey of all dental schools of the 
United States in order to get a’comparative knowledge of what 
was done and upon this information to organize a suggestive stand- 
ardization as to administration, facilities, and instruction. No 
idea of classification of schools appears in its earlier statements. 
From the annual reports of the council to its parent bodies one 
can trace its activities. Initially there was an effort to learn some- 
thing about the relative situation in the schools by questionnaires. 
This was but partially successful. In 1911 a definite attack was 
made upon the indifference in administrative enforcement of the 
preliminary entrance requirements, which had in 1910 been ad- 
vanced nominally to high-school graduation. In 1912 this same 
effort was continued, but practically nothing had been done yet 
on curriculum or inspection of schools, and there appeared little 
interest in the council by a majority of its membership, only a 
few valiant members being responsible for keeping it alive. 
In 1918 the council announced its purpose to inspect all the 
schools and then to classify them into grades A, B, C, following the 
plan adopted for medical schools. 
The council was favorable to the extension of the dental course 
from three to four years. In 1911 an effort in the National Asso- 
ciation of Dental Faculties to secure such an advance, to begin in 
1912, was defeated, but the plan continued to gain adherents. Some 
of the university schools announced it as a definite program; and 
finally in 1915, after strenuous debate, the National Association 
of Dental Faculties adopted the four-year dental curriculum, to
-P-A-G-E-106
  
102 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1922-1924 
become effective beginning with the session of 1917-18. In this 
decision the council had a large influence and here first gave prom- 
ise that it was to become the leading dental educational force of 
the next decade. 
In 1916 the council, having in part overcome the mistrust and 
lack of financial support which had nearly throttled it, really began 
to function, for it announced that, having in the past three years 
inspected all the dental schools, it proposed to publish at once a. 
“model ” curriculum, and also the specifications of a class A school, 
and that after a year it planned to reinspect all schools and make 
an initial classification in 1918. 
The specifications for a class A school and a suggested outline 
of a curriculum were published late in 1916. Those specifications 
were very general and liberal, referring chiefly to quantitative 
specifications. No direct attempt was made to standardize any con- 
ditions to obtain a betterment of quality of teaching, partly because 
no measure of determination had been devised, and partly because 
dental educators, as a class, had not yet come to appreciate the 
importance of quality in instruction in addition to quantity. In- 
deed, the whole history of dental education has been based on quan- 
tity; that is, elapsed time and number of weeks, days, and hours 
in the course. This is only one of the major factors of efficiency 
in education. There was nothing in these first specifications to keep 
commercially conducted schools from the highest rating. The pro- 
posed reinspection of schools in 1917 was not carried out. 
In 1918 came the great opportunity for the Dental Educational 
Council. Among the congressional war measures late in 1917 was 
one providing that an enlisted reserve corps be established to which 
should be eligible, among others, the students of “ well recognized,” 
dental schools. Such reservists were to continue in the schools in 
preparation for professional service in the Army. Being already 
enlisted, these reservists were not subject to draft. 
It became the duty of the Surgeons General to determine which were 
“well-recognized ” dental schools, and in January, 1918, they infor- 
mally asked the American Institute of Dental Teachers, which was 
considered the most representative body in dental education, what 
organization of dentists was best fitted to give this advice. By 
resolution of the teachers the Dental Educational Council was 
designated. Thereupon, by common consent, dental political opposi- 
tion to the council was suspended for the period of the war. In 
March, 1918, the council made its first classification of dental schools 
for the use of the Surgeons General. This was not published until 
after minor revisions at a meeting in August, 1918. 
At this August, 1918, meeting also was adopted a principle that a 
dental school conducted for profit to individuals or a corporation 
 
-P-A-G-E-107
  THE PROGRESS OF DENTAL EDUCATION 103 
does not meet the standard of fair educational ideals as interpreted 
by the council. This was soon after-enlarged to state that such a 
condition would exclude a school from an A classification. Thus the 
council threw down the gauntlet and began the battle between the 
advance of dental education on the one hand and proprietary and 
commercial interests on the other. The war with Germany being 
over, the armistice with the various dental political interests was at 
an end, but the accomplishments of the council had already been so 
great that it was futile to attempt to destroy it. 
The council carried out reinspections, revised its specifications for 
a class A school, revised its classification of schools, elaborated its 
suggestions of curriculum, devised some minimum specifications for 
facilities and equipment, and adopted as a principle that a school 
must have a minimum number of full-time teachers, thus definitely 
beginning a program for the improvement in the quality of dental 
teaching. In its classification it made some blunders in cases where 
it allowed political expediency to nullify its published principles in 
regard to schools conducted for profit. 
In recent years the council and its officers have helpfully and 
whole-heartedly cooperated in the survey of dental education made 
by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, and 
the report of this survey promises to mark an epoch in dental edu- 
cation second to none of the epochs of the past. 
In 1923 the council made one of its most far-reaching contribu- 
tions to dental education when it announced that after January 1, 
1926, no dental school may obtain or retain its highest commenda- 
tory A classification unless, as one of its requirements, it enforces 
for preliminary education one year of work in a college of arts and 
science in addition to completion of a four-year high-school course. 
In 1924 this requirement was extended to include schools of a B 
classification. In this the council only followed the more progres- 
sive schools, for already nearly half the dental schools had this re- 
quirement in operation, several since 1921. 
The council has from time to time revised its classifications, but 
each classification has been only an approximation due to the ever 
persistant influence upon its decisions of interests other than educa- 
tional. 
For the past 10 years the council has been the outstanding dental 
educational agency. It has a history of far-reaching helpfulness to 
dental education, and the credit is largely due to two men of high 
capability and altruistic motive who served it as executive secre- 
taries, the first through its period of early struggle, the last through 
the recent years of its greatest activities and trials. To these two 
men education and dentistry owe a great debt of gratitude. Its 
future usefulness must depend upon whether it can free itself from  
-P-A-G-E-108
  
  104 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1922-1924 
those Machiavellian influences which still are existent in dental 
education, whether it can become a really judicial and constructive 
educational body, or must remain swayed by the winds of political 
and commercial expediency; whether in a word it can become more 
educational and less dental. Only the future can answer. 
7. THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF DENTAL SCHOOLS 
In 1923, after various conferences, a consolidation of the three 
associations of dental schools in America and the one association of 
dental teachers was effected under the above title. Since the new 
association is purely advisory, there is little incentive for political 
machination. 
This new association is for discussion of educational problems, 
particularly those that apply to dental education. The results of 
these discussions are not to be enforced upon any school but are open 
to use by any who wish. This association should attack the prob- 
lems of improvement in the quality of teaching in dental schools, the 
neglect of such problems through all-the years since 1840 being 
largely responsible for the present lack of any concerted opinions and 
actions in the field of pedagogy as applied to dental education. 
8. THE CARNEGIE FOUNDATION FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF TEACHING 
As already noted, as early as 1910 some dental educators advo- 
cated a survey of dental education by some agency outside of den- 
tistry in order that a judicial rather than a biased view might be 
attained. Other dental educators opposed this vigorously, claiming 
that only dentists were competent to judge of dental education and 
that the dentists were entirely capable of cleaning their own house, 
if perchance, as many denied, any purgation was necessary or even 
desirable. It was upon this theory that the survey by the Dental 
Educational Council was proposed. Experience has shown that that 
survey, while of great value, is only approximately a reliable verdict. 
In 1921 the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teach- 
ing determined upon a survey in character similar to that it had 
made in medical education, but with the experience gained in that 
former activity the survey of dental education aimed to be more 
exact and more constructive. 
The two divergent views as to whether such a survey should kis 
made by a dental agency or by a nondental agency were happily 
compromised by a cooperative survey. The dental agency selected 
as the best informed, most comprehensive, and least biased was the 
Dental Educational Council. The nondental agency was the Car- 
negie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, which created 
a division for the study of dental education and put in charge of
-P-A-G-E-109
  THE PROGRESS OF DENTAL EDUCATION 105 
this a gentleman of rare capability and tact, trained in science to 
know the high value of painstaking accuracy, 1 yng experienced in 
teaching a fundamental science in a cognate profession, and in 
sympathy with dentistry through contact with members of the pro- 
fession in cooperative research and publication along lines of dental 
science. 
This study of dental education has been most thorough. No time 
or expense has been spared, and the published result soon to appear 
_ will give a reliable basis for dental, educational, and lay informa- 
tion and judgment. The publicity which this report will give the 
relations of dental education to public health and welfare, and the 
needs of the moral and substantial support of the lay public will 
undoubtedly furnish a stimulus to more rapid constructive advance 
than we have yet seen, and bring to dental education the financial 
support it must have to fulfill its public obligations. 
It has been the privilege of the writer, in common with many 
others, to consult parts of the manuscript of the report in advance. 
This has been freely used in the writing of this chapter, and in- 
debtedness is acknowledged for many facts as to time and place 
which are here incorporated. 
Il. ANALYSIS OF PROGRESS OF DENTAL EDUCATION 
Having reviewed the more important agencies which have affected 
the progress of dental education, it is now logical to discuss the steps 
in this progress. It is impossible to ascribe these advances to any 
one agency, since it is the resultant of all of them. At times all have 
cooperated; again the policy of one agency has been opposed by 
other agencies, resulting in a compromise or a stalemate. Commer- 
cial interests, only ancillary to dentistry, have proven a very serious 
deterrent factor in the attempts at progress. 
It seems best to separate the era of dental education into periods 
and then to consider seriatim the progress in some of the different 
factors that enter into this field of education. 
(A) PERIODS OF PROGRESS 
The periods of progress may be roughly set down as follows: A 
first period from 1840 to 1883, the beginning marked by the estab- 
lishment of the first dental school, the end by the formation of the 
National Association of Dental Examiners. This period is thar- 
acterized by a lack of any coordinated educational effort, and by no 
great advance except the fact that in the latter third of the period six 
universities entered the field of dental education—Harvard in 1867, 
Michigan in 1875, Pennsylvania in 1878, Vanderbilt in 1879, Cali- 
fornia in 1881, and Iowa in 1882.
-P-A-G-E-110
  106 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1922-1924 
A second period from 1884 to 1908, the beginning marked by the 
formation of the National Association of Dental Faculties, the end 
by the organization of the Association of Dental Faculties of Ameri- 
can Universities, the inauguration of an effective effort to enforce 
university ideals of dental education in contrast to the lack of edu- 
cational ideals which pervaded the proprietary schools. This period 
is characterized by the organization of an association of teachers in 
1893; by an advance to a three-session course with a partially suc- 
cessful attempt to establish a graded curriculum; by a gradual, but 
hesitant, advance of the requirement in preliminary education; and 
. by the lengthening of the annual session. 
A third period from 1909 to 1916, beginning with the organiza- 
tion of the Dental Educational Council, the first cooperative effort 
of different agencies, and ending with the adoption of a four-year 
high-school preliminary educational requirement and of a four- 
year professional school curriculum. This period is marked by 
very moderate increase of the nominal entrance requirements and 
by the establishment of a graded curriculum. 
A fourth period from 1917 to 1925, beginning with the actual 
enforcement, in practically all of the schools, of a four-year high- 
school preliminary education and of a four-year professional course 
and ending with the enforcement in all reputable schools of a pre- 
dental year. This period is characterized by the introduction of 
the two basic sciences of biology and physics into the curriculum; 
by increased attention to the fundamental medical sciences; by the 
beginning of a policy of full-time teachers in dental schools; by 
extensive work of the Dental Educational Council in inspection and 
classification of schools; by the rapid disappearance of proprietary 
schools and the increase of real university schools; and finally by the 
publication of the Report of the Carnegie Foundation for the Ad- 
vancement of Teaching, based on its study of dental education. 
(B) PHASES OF PROGRESS 
To consider all the aspects of the advance in dental education 
concomitantly would lead to confusion and a lack of appreciation of 
the relative weight of the different factors; therefore a compre- 
hensive understanding will be facilitated by an analysis of this prog- 
ress into several phases. 
Ofethese phases there are two groups, one quantitative, the other 
qualitative. Progress of those phases which are quantitative can be 
followed readily because the records are reasonably clear. The 
qualitative phases, while fully as important, are more elusive and 
are not capable of as definite delineation. It will appear that 
throughout the progress has been more largely of a quantitative 
 
-P-A-G-E-111
  THE PROGRESS OF DENTAL EDUCATION 107 
nature than of a qualitative, more increase in years and weeks of 
instruction than improvement in quality of the instruction given in 
those years and weeks. . 
These quantitative phases may be well considered under three 
headings—preliminary education, length of the session of instruc- 
tion, and number of sessions prerequisite to graduation. 
1, PROGRESS IN PRELIMINARY EDUCATION 
There was apparently no inquiry, certainly no requirement, as to 
preliminary education for entrance to all dental schools in the years 
from 1840 to 1884, although individual schools definitely connected 
with universities did, as early as 1878, make some inquiry of pro- 
spective students in regard to previous education. 
When the National Association of Dental Faculties was formed it 
recommended, at its first meeting in 1884, that a preliminary exami- 
nation be required covering a “good English education” unless a 
diploma were presented from a reputable literary institution or other 
evidence of literary qualification given. One wonders just how much 
this “good English education ” meant until we find in the course of 
the deliberations of this body nearly a decade later a very consider- 
able debate and successful resistance when it was proposed to ad- 
vance the preliminary education to require the completion of the 
grades of the grammar school. 
Not until 1896 was there, even nominally, an entrance require- 
ment by all member schools of the National Association of Dental 
Faculties of an education equivalent to ability to enter the high 
school. At this date nearly all medical schools were requiring high- 
school graduation for entrance. 
In 1899 further prescribed, although by no means rigorously 
enforced, entrance requirements became effective by demanding 
completion of the first year of high school previous to entering the 
dental school. 
In 1903 a further increase to two years of high-school work before 
entrance was adopted by the National Association of Dental Facul- 
ties, to become effective in 1904, and accompanied by an increase in 
the professional course from three to four years. This increase 
of the length of the professional course was rescinded within a few 
: months. 
In 1907 the National Association of Dental Faculties again ad- 
vanced for its members the entrance requirements to completion 
of three years of high-school work, and in 1910 to high-school 
graduation. This latter was an apparent advance but not neces- 
sarily a real advance, because there were many high schools with 
but a two-year or three-year course and graduation from these ful- 
   
-P-A-G-E-112
  108 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1922-1924 
filled the requirement. Not until 1917 was the necessary stipulation 
added that graduation must be from a high school with a four-year 
course. 
Throughout this period of more than 20 years, from 1896 to 1917, 
while the specifications for preliminary education were gradually 
advanced, there was always included in the stated requirement the 
vitiating modifying clause “or equivalent.” The equivalence fre- 
quently was so liberally interpreted as really to mean only a certifi- 
cate of good moral character and the payment of fees, the latter, 
at least, always being relentlessly insisted upon. The National 
Association of Dental Faculties was paying little attention to those 
factors which determine the quality of instruction in the schools, 
but was satisfied with quantity only. Even the quantity require- 
ments affected only the member schools and were to a large extent 
merely published requirements rather than enforced requirements, 
for as late as 1909 the president of the association in his annual 
address said: 
It has long been a practice among the members of this body to accept stu- 
dents with certain conditions to be removed during their college course. This 
practice appears to be just and proper. 
Later disclosures showed that from 1896 to 1916 in many of the 
schools there was resort to various subterfuges to secure “creden- 
tials” for the required amount of preliminary education for candi- 
dates who actually lacked formal schooling to the extent set down 
in the printed rules. It apparently was not appreciated that the 
purpose of entrance requirements is to assure the capability that 
will enable the student to secure from the outset of the profes- 
sional course the complete benefit of the instruction offered him, 
and that without complete enforcement of preliminary education 
the professional course must totter on an unstable foundation. 
From discussion in the proceedings of the National Association of 
Dental Faculties we learn that it was also a common practice to 
accept students some weeks after the instruction had begun and to 
permit them to leave the school a considerable period before the close 
of the session, and also, on occasion, to permit a student to take two 
of the years of instruction concurrently in a single year. Thus, 
with no attempt at control of the quality of instruction, the quantity 
was abbreviated by liberal entrance conditions, coupled with care- 
lessness in their enforcement, by abbreviated attendance, and by 
telescoping the curriculum. 
By 1912 the Dental Faculties Association of American Universi- 
ties was coming to exert considerable influence. For several years 
its members had been requiring high-school graduation for entrance, 
and in most cases graduation from a four-year high school. Its
-P-A-G-E-113
  THE PROGRESS OF DENTAL EDUCATION 109 
influence was indirectly reflected upon the better schools that were 
members of the National Association of Dental Faculties, and in 
1916 that association also adopted graduation from a four-year high 
school as a minimum entrance requirement. The university dental 
schools were also looking forward to further advance, expecting to 
demand some college work for entrance, with the aim of bringing 
the preliminary education required of dental students to an equality 
with the two years of undergraduate college work required to enter 
medical schools. 
The war stopped further advance, but it also clearly showed the 
need for a dental profession with a better general education upon 
which the professional training should be built. 
At the end of the war the Dental Educational Council had 
become the most powerful agency in dental education. In 1921 
many of the university dental schools began the enforcement of an 
entrance requirement of one year in a college of arts and science, 
with certain specified subjects. The Dental Educational Council, 
following this example, in 1923 adopted a resolution that this 
entrance requirement would be demanded of all schools seeking an 
A classification after January 1, 1926. In 1924 this requirement 
was extended to include also all schools of B classification. Since 
only A and B schools are likely to be recognized by State boards, 
this means that all reputable schools will in the future require one 
predental year of undergraduate college work. However, this does 
not bring the preliminary requirements in dental schools to an 
equality with the two premedical years of college work demanded 
by all reputable medical schools. 
Just as some schools have always been outside the standard 
regulations and lagged behind in every advance, so others have 
forged ahead and enforced more than the usual standard. There 
has never been absolute uniformity in requirement and enforce- 
ment of preliminary education, and probably never will be, but in 
time it will become stabilized close to a norm. It would be un- 
wise for any one to predict in print what that norm is going to 
be or when it will be effective. It has been much discussed in 
recent years, and there seems a fairly general consensus of opinion 
among dental educators that the norm will be approximately two 
years of college work based on 15 units of secondary education. 
‘As to the time when it will become effective there is a great variety 
of opinion. 
If one judges by past performances in the advance of entrance 
requirements, we find the increments after 1896 were at intervals of 
- three, three, five, three, seven, and nine years, respectively, which 
would perhaps warrant a conjecture that the next general advance 
27301°—27-——-8
-P-A-G-E-114
  
110 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1922-1924 
in entrance requirements will be somewhere between 5 and 10 years 
after 1926. Meanwhile individual schools will independently ad- 
vance, but the general advance will depend very greatly upon what 
comes to be the general acceptation of the number of years that are 
to be built upon the entrance foundation. This will be discussed 
in another relation. 
There can be no doubt of the advantage of close uniformity in 
entrance requirements. In the individual school it is essential 
sharply to define the minimum. This stabilizes the intake of the 
partially finished product, which is to the dental school the raw 
material from which it must fashion the graduate ready for the 
profession. Too great variation makes for lack of assimilation into 
the school. Individuality there must be, but the base upon which 
the superstructure of the professional course is to be built must 
at least come up to a minimum level. 
The question is whether the dental schools are, at this time, able 
to offer to an entrant a course of a quality that can advantageously 
use the information and training to be secured by a second year of 
work in the college of arts and science. When, in a later section, 
the quality of teaching is discussed, the opinion will be expressed 
that there is another problem fully as important as immediate 
further advance of entrance requirements. The problem of entrance 
requirements has such close interrelation with curriculum organiza- 
tion and improvement of quality of teaching that it can not be solved 
separately. These three major factors must be adjusted jointly. 
2. LENGTH OF THE ANNUAL SCHOOL SESSION 
The first session of the Baltimore College of Dental Surgery 
extended from November 3, 1840, to the latter part of February, 
1841, with the graduation of two of the five students on March 9, 
1841. This designated time was four months, but it is fair to pre- 
sume that, with Christmas holidays out, the exact period of instruc- 
tion was 16 weeks, which was then the usual length of session in 
medical schools. The length of term in most medical schools in- 
creased after the Civil War to 20 weeks and about 1880 to 24 weeks. 
Apparently the dental schools did not follow the medical schools in 
this advance, as they appear to have been still on a four-months 
basis in 1884, when the National Association of Dental Faculties set 
the four-month session to be a standard beginning in the school year 
1884-85. By 1888 the standard length of session had increased to 
5 months, in 1896 to 6 months, in 1899 to 7 months. In all of these 
cases this was elapsed time and included the holiday vacation. 
Deducting this vacation, the weeks of instruction were, at the dates 
noted, 16, 20, 24, and 28. The next increase was in 1904, to 30 
 
-P-A-G-E-115
THE PROGRESS OF DENTAL EDUCATION 111 
teaching weeks. In many cases there were only five teaching days 
per week, but in 1910, when the increase to 32 weeks became effective, 
it also carried a specification of six days per week, exclusive of 
vacations. Thus in the 25 years from 1885 to 1910 the number of 
weeks of teaching in the school session was exactly doubled. 
In the majority of the schools now there are 32 weeks of instruc- 
tion, exclusive of the weeks set aside for examinations. In some 
schools the number of teaching weeks is 36. 
3. NUMBER OF YEARS IN THE COURSE 
The charter of the first dental school in 1840 specified that it should 
give a course consisting of at least one session of four months. When 
the Harvard Dental School was started in 1867 it specified that two 
sessions of four months each would be given, with required additional 
service under a preceptor. This was considered a very striking 
advance. The two-session curriculum was pretty generally adopted 
by the schools that were organized in the seventies and eighties, and 
not until the early nineties did the three-session course come to be at 
all general. In 1891-92 this became the rule in the National Asso- 
ciation of Dental Faculties. There was then a period of 25 years 
before the four-session course became a rule, excepting that in 1903-4 
an abortive attempt was made to increase to a four-session course, 
the decision being reversed within a few months after it was 
adopted. Meanwhile the length of session was gradually lengthened. 
But the number of sessions in the professional school is not the 
whole story. For comparison of educational progress in dentistry 
one must count the number of years from completion of the gram- 
mar grades to the dental degree. If we assume that, even in the 
early history of American dental education, all students had com- 
pleted the grammar grades, which we know is not true, we get the 
following number of years after completion of the grammar grades 
to gain the dental degree, current in the majority of the schools for 
the years specified : 
1840-1869 One professional year of 16 weeks—total, one year. 
1870-1891 Two professional years of 16 to 20 weeks each—total, two years. 
1891-1899 Three professional years of 20 to 24 weeks each—total, three years. 
1899-1902 One year of high school and three professional years of 28 weeks 
each—total, four years. 
1902-3 Two years of high school and three professional years of 28 weeks 
each—total, five years. 
1903-4 Two years of high school and four professional years of 28 weeks 
each—total, six years. 
1904-1907 ‘Two years of high school and three professional years of 30 weeks 
each—total, five years. 
1907-1910 ‘Three years of high school and three professional years of 830 weeks 
each—total, six years.
-P-A-G-E-116
  
112 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1922-1924 
1910-1917 Two to four years of high school and three professional years of 
32 weeks each—total, five to seven years. 
1917-1924 Four years of high school and four professional years of 32 weeks 
each—total, eight years. 
1924— Four years of high school, one year of college, and four profes- 
sional years of 32 weeks each—total, nine years. 
Comparing 1869 and 1925 we see that the minimum number of 
years between the grammar school and the dental degree is now nine 
times what it was in 1869. Comparing 1891 and 1925, we find that 
the number of sessions in the professional school in, 1925 is twice 
that in 1891. We have already seen that the present length of ses- 
sion is a minimum of 32 weeks, against 16 in 1884. The number of 
weeks’ instruction in the entire professional school course in 1884 was 
32, but this was repeated instruction in a nongraded curriculum; 
so the actual number of weeks of new instruction received by each 
student was but 16. Now it is 128 weeks, or eight times as many 
weeks of new instruction as in 1884. When in connection with this, 
it is considered that the average dental student now has five years 
more of education before entering the professional school than he 
had in 1884, we may assume that his profit by instruction by reason 
of education and maturity is from 50 to 100 per cent increased over 
that of the students of 1884, which indicates a dental professional 
course to-day from 12 to 16 times the value of that of- 1884, irrespec- 
tive of any improvements in equipment and in the quality of teach- 
ing. To-day’s course is 24 to 32 times as effective as that of 1869. 
Truly the quantitative increase has been wonderful. 
One may conjecture as to the length of the dental course of the 
future, but the prevalent opinion of dental educators is that the 
dental course will finally become stabilized-at four years of profes- 
sional study after two years of preparation in a college of arts and 
science, making a total of six years from high-school graduation to 
dental degree, and that this will be reached within a decade. 
Meanwhile, it is conceded that we shall have a period during which 
five years from high school to dental degree will prevail. There are 
two plans as to the division of these five years. One is that the pres- 
ent one year of college entrance and four years of professional 
school will continue until such a time as two years of college work 
can be generally required for entrance. The other plan is that the 
schools should immediately require two years of college work for 
entrance, reduce the professional curriculum leading to the initial 
dental degree to three years, saving time by more effective teaching 
and by excluding the dental specialties, and then offer the specialties 
and some advanced work in one additional optional year leading to a 
second dental degree. This plan assumes that enough more effective 
teaching can be at once secured to do in three years what is now  
-P-A-G-E-117
THE PROGRESS OF DENTAL EDUCATION 113 
taking nearly four years to accomplish. It is conceded in this plan 
that perhaps ultimately this optional year will be incorporated into 
the required course, the initial degree abandoned, and thus lead to the 
stabilized program of six years from high school to dental degree. 
The progress in the qualitative aspects of dental education are less 
definite but may be referred to under six headings: The graded cur- 
riculum, the breadth of curriculum, the equipment, the quality of in- 
struction, the standards of scholarship, and university control. 
4, THE GRADED CURRICULUM 
In 1884 the usual professional curriculum in dentistry, following 
the prevalent custom in medicine for more than a century, consisted 
of a single course of lectures in each of several subjects, repeated 
year after year. To these courses came first-year students, second- 
year students who had heard the lectures once, and later third-year 
students. If such a course were scaled for comprehension by the 
first-year students, it would be very elementary and lack any stimulus 
for the second and third year men, If it were planned for the older 
classes, it would be almost unintelligible for the freshmen. If it 
_ tried to compromise, it would fit none of them. 
The unsoundness of this plan became fully apparent when labora- 
tory subjects were introduced. A student might consent to attend 
the same lectures twice, but to repeat the same laboratory course 
_ twice would hardly be tolerated, and yet in human dissection, which 
is the oldest type of laboratory course in medical education, it is 
less than a decade since some medical schools ceased to require that 
a student dissect the body twice. 
The repetitive curriculum was an inexpensive course to carry on, 
because it required only a fraction of the teachers required by the 
graded course. It was prevalent until the early nineties, then grad- 
ually was replaced by the graded curriculum, but it took more than 
two decades -fuily to eradicate it, and even to-day there are a few 
vestiges in the “circular courses.” 
Into this matter of graded curriculum enters another aspect, and 
that is the matter of sequence of courses. The justification of a 
graded curriculum is that progressively throughout all the years of 
the course the earlier subjects shall prepare for the subjects that 
follow, and that the later subjects shall make use of the information 
and training gained in the earlier courses. This fundamental peda- 
gogical principle has not been uniformly enforced in, dental educa- 
tion. In the university dental schools that are part of a systematic 
educational force the logical sequence of courses has been reasonably 
well regulated, but in the independent schools this has been largely 
ignored, and some subjects occupy unfit positions in the curriculum.   
 
-P-A-G-E-118
114 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1922-1924 
This educational problem needs careful and thorough study in 
order that both proper sequence and correlation of courses and sub- 
jects may be obtained. Its very complete neglect is one of the out- 
standing failures of the dental education. 
5. THE BREADTH OF THE CURRICULUM 
The subjects of the curriculum of the first dental school were those 
of the medical curriculum of that day, exclusive of any considerable 
attention to clinical medicine and surgery, and plus mechanical and 
operative dentistry. Specialties in dentistry were not yet in vogue. 
As time went on, less and less attention was given in dental schools 
to medical subjects and more and more to the dental subjects, espe- 
cially to mechanical dentistry. The average curriculum of 1870 was 
not as broad as that of 1850. 
As dental schools associated with medical schools began to arise, 
there was a return to more emphasis on anatomy and physiology, 
though usually only in lecture courses. With the rise of cellular 
pathology, following the work of Virchow and his pupils, nearly 
coincident with the beginning of bacteriology by Pasteur and the 
work of Koch on infectious diseases, there came in the last decades of 
the nineteenth century a great stimulus to the study of bacteriology 
and pathology. This first appeared in the medical schools, was soon 
seen in those dental schools connected with universities, and slowly 
crept into the independent dental schools. The first laboratory 
course in bacteriology in a dental school was one in a university 
dental school in a mid-Western State about 1895. Pathology and 
bacteriology continued to be taught solely by lectures in most dental 
schools until 1917. Only in some university dental schools were 
laboratory courses given. The subject of dental pathology as taught 
in dental schools was not at all a laboratory subject, nor was it really 
pathology, but a conglomeration of etiology, pathology, diagnosis, 
and treatment, both medical and mechanical. Even at the present 
day many dental schools give no laboratory course on the pathology 
of the oral cavity. Clinical dental pathology is still similarly neg- 
lected. 
Chemistry entered the dental curriculum relatively early, and 
with anatomy and histology has had reasonable attention for the 
past 30 years. Physiology has usually been only a didactic course 
but now is coming to have a practical laboratory phase added. 
In 1917, with the inauguration of the four-year curriculum, came 
the greatest broadening of the dental curriculum at any one time 
by the introduction into the first year of the standard four-year 
curriculum, recommended by the Dental Educational Council, of 
biology, physics, English, and mechanical drawing. The most im- 
 
-P-A-G-E-119
THE PROGRESS OF DENTAL EDUCATION 115 
portant of these innovations was the introduction of a required 
course in biology. This was later to be transferred to the predental 
year, but, beginning with 1917, every dental student has received 
systematic instruction in biology as an introduction to his profes- 
sional course. The far-reaching import of this was appreciated by 
only a few educators at that time, but it laid the foundation upon 
which a great change in the conception of dentistry is to arise. This 
change is that dentistry is coming to be considered in its biological 
relations to the various functions of the human body, instead of 
primarily as a mechanical art in the restoration of defective or lost 
structures. The introduction of these academic subjects was not 
done without resistance. The dentists and dental educators were 
not at all enthusiastic about them; in fact, some of them contended 
that all the additional time should go to mechanical and operative 
dentistry. 
Perhaps the attitude of a considerable part of the dentists toward 
a broadening of the curriculum can best be illustrated by the opinion 
of the nestor of American dentistry, known internationally as one of 
the leaders of dentistry and dental education, a graduate in medicine 
as well as in dentistry and a dental teacher for 40 years. In a 
stenographic report on page 65 of the proceedings of the National 
Association of Dental Faculties for 1911, in a discussion concerning 
giving advanced standing to medical students, he is quoted as saying: 
“The medical man in the first two years is devoting his time to 
biology and other subjects that have no bearing at all on dentistry.” 
With such opinions from the most revered and honored leaders, it is 
small wonder that the policy of broadening the dental curriculum 
was long delayed, and when these academic subjects were introduced 
into the curriculum they were very shabbily cared for, either in pro- 
vision of equipment or of competent and stimulating teachers. 
However, it took a very short time to prove their value, and they 
furnished a stimulus for extension of the medical subjects and 
strongly influenced the appreciation of the value of predental col- 
legiate work. With the introduction of the predental college year 
these academic subjects have been transferred to the preprofessional 
school work, permitting yet more attention to the medical subjects. 
As a result, the curriculum of 10 years ago has been greatly im- 
proved in the way of a greater emphasis upon the fundamental 
sciences and a relative, although not absolute, diminution in the 
mechanical phase of the course of study. The results are already 
seen in the products of the newer dental education, who not only are 
better trained, but are also better able to keep abreast of the great 
advance in dentistry and medicine that will occur during their pro- 
fessional lives.

6. EQUIPMENT IN DENTAL TEACHING 
There is no adequate record of just what equipment was consid- 
ered a minimum at any time in the history of dental education. 
A survey of the equipment of dental schools was made in 1896 by the 
National Association of Dental Faculties, but no organized report 
was printed. It seems impossible to ascertain, with any approach 
to accuracy, what was the usual equipment of the dental schools in 
early days. The catalogues tell of the “complete and modern” 
equipment, but to one familiar with the fanciful imaginations of 
some writers of fiction whose efforts appear in the professional 
school catalogues, this is not evidence. 
‘When the Dental Educational Council was formed, it was hoped 
that a standard for equipment would be devised, but it was never 
done, although some rather broad and liberal suggestions were 
made. In the proprietary schools, even of recent years, the major 
part of the equipment was in the infirmary. Here the modern 
improvements in chairs and accessories were usually the first to be 
provided. The technical laboratories had little, and even to-day the 
dental student provides for himself most of the appliances and 
instruments with which he works in his dental subjects. Only the 
larger pieces of apparatus, like lathes and vulcanizers, are provided 
by the school, and in some schools not even these. The typical 
laboratory equipment in dental technology is a room, more or less 
well lighted, with drawers and lockers and tables bare of any equip- 
ment except gas jets. In better schools there are, in addition, some 
teaching models and charts. 
When one reaches the equipment of the laboratories in funda- 
mental subjects and medical sciences, the independent schools usu- 
ally felt these hardly worthy of serious consideration, and their 
equipment has been very meager. In the university schools these 
subjects are cared for in the college of arts and science, and in 
university medical schools they usually have reasonably adequate 
equipment and facilities. As to libraries, with a few praiseworthy 
exceptions, these have been noticeable until recent years chiefly by 
their absence. To-day only about half of the dental schools have a 
library containing as many as 1,000 volumes. 
There is even to-day no accepted standard of what equipment a 
dental school should have anywhere outside the infirmary. All else 
is simply opinion of different men whose opinions are much influ- 
enced by their major interests. If one may rely upon the recollec- 
tion of older dentists, there has been great improvement, but when 
one tries to find any really comparative details, it is futile; and 
about the only conclusion that can be reached is that, in general, 
there has been gradual improvement in all dental schools in equip-
-P-A-G-E-121
  THE PROGRESS OF DENTAL EDUCATION 117 
ment, and this improvement has been much more rapid in the past 
10 years, especially in those subjects that are now taught in the 
undergraduate and medical departments of universities, 
7. THE QUALITY OF INSTRUCTION 
As already suggested in various connections, the attention of den- 
tal educators in endeavoring to secure concerted action in improving 
dental education has been directed almost exclusively to quantitative 
advance, that is, to extension of the number of years of preliminary 
education, to the number of weeks per session, and to the number 
of sessions required to attain the degree in dentistry. Prac- 
tically no concerted action has been taken to improve the quality of 
teaching, nor has consideration been given to the requisite training 
of the teacher in dental schools. While those engaged in dental edu- 
cation have been ready at all times to insist that dentistry has long 
since risen to the dignity of a profession, they have not appreciated 
that education is not only an older but also a much broader profes- 
sion, in which the education of the dentists is but one small corner. 
Indeed, many of those in dental education have taken the opposite 
view and insisted that teachers in dental schools shall be dentists, 
but that their further qualifications along educational professional 
lines are secondary or merely incidental. This has brought two re- 
sults; first, that the greater part of the teaching in dental schools in 
the past, and only in somewhat lesser degree at present, has been 
done by men to whom teaching is merely an incident. Men are 
chosen to professorships in dental schools not because of any ex- 
perience or accomplishments in teaching either past or expected but 
because of success and prominence in the practice of dentistry. The 
second and sequential result has been that these men, busily occupied 
in their practice, have themselves not done any considerable portion 
of the teaching, and so have delegated to demonstrators a large part 
of the intimate teaching and contact with the students. 
The demonstratorships are ordinarily filled by very recent gradu- 
ates. These men look upon such positions as merely temporary and 
serve but one year, or at best a very few years. During this time 
their relation to the school is an avocation, for they commonly have 
begun to practice immediately after graduation. These recent grad- 
uates, conventionally with no more than the minimum preliminary 
education and lacking pedagogical training or teaching experience 
in any line, have constituted the majority of the teachers in dental 
education throughout its history and have done the bulk of the 
teaching in the dental subjects, usually with mediocrity. 
When, in the nineties, more emphasis began to be placed upon the 
medical subjects, the independent schools assigned these subjects  
-P-A-G-E-122
  118 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1922-1924 
either to dentists or to practicing physicians whose pedagogical 
efficiency was little, if any, better. With the advent of full-time 
teachers in the medical schools, the dental schools that were integral 
departments of universities participated in the improvement in edu- 
cational procedure in the medical subjects. When, in 1917, the 
academic subjects were introduced into the dental curriculum those 
schools intimately associated with universities benefited by the stabil- 
ized pedagogical efficiency in these subjects in the undergraduate 
college of the university, but in independent schools the teaching of 
the academic subjects was not comprehended and much neglected. 
Of the many noteworthy advances in dental education accom- 
plished by the Dental Educational Council, none is more far-reach- 
ing than its insistence that the teaching should not be entirely by 
men to whom teaching is merely an incident, but that there should 
be on every teaching staff some men to whom teaching is at least 
a vocation, if not a profession; and to accomplish this there should 
be in every school some full-time teachers. In addition, there should 
be an additional number of men to whom teaching is at least an avo- 
cation rather than merely incidental, and who are giving at least 
half of their time to teaching. The initial number designated was 
small, but the more significant thing was that it was specified that 
some of them must be in dental subjects. 
It is clear that dental education from now on must be a university 
function, and the greatest problem in university dental education 
of the immediate future is not preliminary education but improve- 
ment of the quality of teaching in the dental subjects. The academic 
subjects will be cared for in the predental year, and the medical 
subjects will come under the supervision of the university medical 
schools, which can be depended upon to conduct them acceptably, 
but an adequate quality of teaching in dental subjects must be 
worked out in the dental schools. This can be accomplished only 
when teaching dental subjects comes to be as dignified a career as 
practicing dentistry, and that end lies in the dental profession, and 
when, through public support, adequate salaries will attract capable 
graduates to a career in dental education. 
The quality of teaching in dental schools showed only slight im- 
provement for many years, but since 1917 there has been a great 
impetus, and we may look with confidence to a fruition of recent 
efforts in the next decade. As in all other phases of the dental edu- 
cational problem, some schools, almost invariably those that were in- 
tegral parts of universities, have led in the quality of teaching and at 
all times have been in advance of the general level. Now that all 
schools are to become of this type, we may expect effective results.

8. STANDARDS OF SCHOLARSHIP 
No data are available as to what proportion of the aggregate 
dental student body year by year has been dropped for deficient 
scholarship. In the surveys by the Carnegie Foundation for the Ad- 
vencement of Teaching one of the points upon which information 
was sought was the number or proportion of students that were dis- 
missed for poor scholarship. The information thus secured showed 
a very sharp contrast between the procedure of the proprietary type 
of school and the real university school. 
In the proprietary school dismissal for deficient scholastic attain- 
ment is almost unknown. Some men voluntarily withdraw from con- 
viction of inability to carry the course or distaste for the work and 
some students are delayed in graduation, but there is resort to dis- 
missal only in case of serious moral turpitude or for failure to pay 
‘tuition. Now, that dental schools are all to be under control of uni- 
versities, the elimination of the unfit student can be confidently ex- 
pected in the dental schools as well as in all other departments of 
the university. Elimination of the unfit is a cardinal principle of 
efficient professional education, and now that dental education is be- 
coming more educational and less dental the application of this prin- 
ciple seems assured. 
While graduation in dentistry carried the right to practice, the 
dental school became careless of the fitness of its graduates. With 
the advent of the procedure that graduates must appear before the 
State boards of examination and licensure there was a check upon 
this carelessness which had a salutary influence upon the quality 
of the dental teaching and the rigor of school examinations. When, 
about 1905, the National Association of Dental Examiners inau- 
gurated a tabulation committee and issued public reports of results 
in licensing examinations, there came a further tightening in the 
requirements for graduation, for a record of many failures to 
obtain license by the graduates of any school diverted prospective 
students to other places for their dental course. 
The licensing boards, in their examinations, have properly put the 
emphasis upon knowledge of and ability in practical dentistry, and 
their standards on the fundamental sciences and medical subjects 
have been much lower than on the dental subjects. The teaching 
efforts in the dental schools have responded to this differentiation. 
State boards of examination therefore should have credit for 
aiding in improving the preparation for entrance to the practice, 
but have not been equally helpful in stimulating a broadening of 
dental education; in fact, they are at times deterrent to this effort by 
 
-P-A-G-E-124
  120 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1922-1924 
imposing rules that hamper educational forces in the educational 
experimentation necessary to find the most desirable procedures in 
the education of the student. 
9, UNIVERSITY CONTROL 
Frequent reference has been made in the foregoing pages to the 
conflict between the proprietary thesis of dental education as com- 
pared to real educational principles. Beginning with a single uni- 
versity dental school in 1867, but overwhelmed in numbers for 
decades by the independent schools, the university dental school 
has been in the minority until very recently. In the past two 
decades gradually appeared an appreciation that education for the 
dental profession is a public service that rests in the universities, 
both State and private, and the number of university schools has 
slowly increased. In recent years many independent schools have 
either become university departments or have effected affiliations 
that are educationally advantageous. 
The independent dental school, with rare exceptions, did not com- 
prehend the needs of dental education, or if it did, was unwilling 
and unable to provide for their fulfillment. With the extinction of 
the independent school there comes a distinct need for the extension 
of university participation in dental education. Dentistry being 
now recognized as a part of the health service, its correlation with 
medicine becomes closer and closer, and each university that feels 
its public duty to carry on medical education should see that there 
is a similar duty regarding dental education. 
The curriculum is similar in the first two years except for dental 
technology, and even those medical schools that provide only two 
years of the medical curriculum could well similarly provide the 
first two years of the dental curriculum, the students in their later 
years to go to schools where more clinical material is available. 
However, the question of clinical teaching material in dentistry does 
not involve availability of hospitals, and so can well be carried on in 
university towns where the teaching of the clinical years in medicine 
is not feasible. It is to be hoped that we may see the rise in the 
next decade of several dental schools in connection with university 
medical schools at places where there is yet no dental education. 
‘CONCLUSION 
Any effort to trace the progress of dental education is one of 
difficulty, because of lack of records of accurate detail, although 
some general summaries have appeared from time to time, but what 
has been attempted here is to give to one, interested in education in 
general, a broad view of the problems and progress of this one field.
-P-A-G-E-125
  THE PROGRESS OF DENTAL EDUCATION 121 
With that purpose in view, detailed statistics have not been included, 
nor discussion of the curriculum in detail or of technicalities peculiar 
to dental education, since this is not written solely for dental read- 
ers but as well for those not familiar with dental terminology. 
At the present time we are in the midst of the most active period 
of progress in the entire history of this field of education. The 
publication in 1925 of the report on the Study of Dental Education 
made during the past four years under the auspices of the Carnegie 
Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching will make that year 
an epochal year in dental education, equal to 1840, 1884, 1893, 1908-9, 
and 1917. There can be no doubt that progress will continue. The 
next few years will see in dental education great advancement and 
a probable stabilization, and a decade hence, better than now, can 
be written a judicial appreciation of the results of the activities in 
the past 10 years.

CHAPTER VI 
RECENT PROGRESS. IN LEGAL EDUCATION! 
By Aurrep Z. Rep 
Staff Member of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching 
For nearly half a century there have been organized efforts to 
effect a nation-wide improvement in the American system of legal 
education. The strictly modern phase of this movement may be 
said to have started—in so far as it is possible to assign a definite 
date—in 1910. It was in this year that similar long-continued efforts 
by the American Medical Association to improve medical education 
first impinged upon the public consciousness, and suggested to law- 
yers that methods which had proved successful with physicians might 
be applicable also to the legal profession. 
In many respects the task of legal reformers was far more difficult 
than that of their medical colleagues. Before recounting some of 
the partictilar obstacles and the progress which has since been made 
in surmounting them, a general explanation may be hazarded as 
to why the legal profession was then, and is still, in a relatively 
backward stage of development. The science of law, or at least 
that particular portion of this science (if it be a science) which 
primarily concerns American law schools and bar admission au- 
thorities, is not international in the sense that medical science is. 
In the development of medical schools physicians can draw imme- 
diately upon the experience of the whole world. The task of the 
American law schools, on the other hand, is severely conditioned 
by the fact that these schools exist primarily for the purpose of 
preparing students to practice American law. This is now so dif- 
ferent from that of other countries—even from the English common 
law, of which it is historically an outgrowth and, in a certain sense, 
still a part—that foreign models of legal education and organiza- 
tion, though often suggestive, are rarely closely parallel. Far less 
than physicians can lawyers profit by the intellectual resources of 
other countries. America is virtually obliged to work out its

Dean Henry M. Bates, of the University of Michigan Law School, to the Reports for 1914 
(Vol. I, Ch, X) and 1916 (Vol. I, Ch. XI),

peculiar experiment in government and law by itself, guided only 
by its own-relatively brief and narrow experience. 
It will be convenient to consider briefly what the situation was 
in 1910; then what has been accomplished to improve conditions 
in 16 years; and, finally, what are the most important problems 
that still await a satisfactory solution. 
I. THE PAST 
First, then, as to some of the ways in which the status of legal — 
education compared unfavorably with that of medical education 
in 1910. 
DEFECTIVE ORGANIZATION OF THE LEGAL PROFESSION IN 1910 
One conspicuous difference between the two professions was the 
relative lack of effective organization among lawyers. Among 
their many weaknesses in this respect perhaps the most fundamental 
was this: The medical profession proper constituted only one of 
several groups which were engaged in practicing the healing arts 
or “health service” as a whole. The legal profession, on the other 
hand, assumed to include everyone who was in any way practicing 
law, though the actual occupations might be as diverse as those of 
a physician or surgeon, a trained nurse, a dentist, a pharmacist, or 
a veterinarian. This inclusion of many different kinds of lawyers 
and pseudolawyers under the common head of general practitioner 
made it difficult to plan an effective preparation for any one kind 
and tended to weaken the esprit de corps of a fictitiously united 
profession. 
Another weakness was that State lines split up the lawyers, far 
more than the physicians, into mutually independent local units. 
This weakness is in part due to the nature of the profession. Just 
as American law, in a general sense, differs from the law of any 
other country, so that particular blend of legislation and judicial 
decision which is actually in force in any one State is never precisely 
identical with the law in force in any other State of the Union. 
None the less, the general principles are so similar that a compre- 
hensive nation-wide organization of lawyers is indicated as not 
merely practicable, but also as peculiarly desirable, for the very 
purpose of counteracting the centrifugal tendencies of our Federal 
system. This comprehensive organization did not exist. Whereas 
the American Medical Association, since its origin in 1847, had been 
an integration of State and local medical societies, the American 
Bar Association, organized in 1878, still competed for membership 
with independent State and with independent city bar associations. 
Under these conditions, it contained in 1910 only 3,690 members, or
-P-A-G-E-129
  RECENT PROGRESS IN LEGAL EDUCATION 125 
3 per cent of all lawyers in the United States. The attendance at 
the annual meeting was 326, or 9 per cent of the membership. 
Again, the American Medical Association, largely because of its 
advantageous situation in the two respects above noted, had already 
developed an effective system of professional supervision over 
medical schools and medical licensing authorities. Its extensive 
membership made possible the publication of a weekly Journal, 
through which the facts could be published to the pro- 
fession at large. It also made possible the establishment of a 
Council on Medical Education, with compensated executive officers, 
for the ascertainment of these facts. In 1910 the work of this coun- 
cil had culminated, for the time being, in the publication of a classi- 
fied list of schools, and ‘of a registry containing the educational 
record of all practicing physicians. Nothing of this sort existed in 
the American Bar Association. Its only periodical publication was 
the report of proceedings at its annual meetings. Here were re- 
corded the unhappy rivalries of a mutually independent “ Commit- 
tee on Legal Education and Admissions to the Bar” and “ Section 
of Legal Education”; the more or less permanent but uncompen- 
sated members of the committee or officers of the section made recom- 
mendations which occasionally resulted in the passage of relatively 
fruitless resolutions by the association. 
Still another factor of great importance in its bearing upon the 
capacity for united effort possessed by either profession was the 
different position occupied by the professional school. In the medi- 
eal profession the medical school was accepted, both inside and 
outside of the profession, as a sine qua non in the process of prepara- 
tion. In an overwhelming majority of States graduation from a 
medical college was compulsory. “ Practicing physician” and 
“M. D.”, the degree of doctor of medicine, were, and long had been, 
yirtually interconvertible terms. Legal education, however, was 
still in the process of emerging from the apprenticeship phase. The 
relatively modern law school had everywhere won its first victory 
over the conservative supporters of the older system of office prepa- 
ration; in all States study at a law school was possible under the 
rules for admission to the bar. In no State, however, was. law 
school study obligatory; and many influential older practitioners 
had not yet grasped the truth that a system of legal preparation 
which had worked well in their cases could not, simply because of 
the greatly increased volume and complexity of the law, be ex- 
pected to yield equally good results to-day. 
Accordingly, alongside of the American Bar Association, with its 
‘committee and section, the Association of American Law Schools 
made its own independent decisions as to the standards that were 
appropriate for admission to membership in its body. This organi- 
27301°—27-_9
-P-A-G-E-130
  126 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1922-1924 
zation of law teachers was, on the whole, a more effective agency for 
the improvement of legal education than the practitioners’ associa- 
tion, but was not taken very seriously by the profession at large. 
DIVISION OF THE LAW SCHOOLS AMONG THEMSELVES 
These comparative weaknesses in the organization of the legal 
profession were the more regrettable because of a much more evenly 
balanced division of forces in the law school world. Although the 
development of a proper system of medical licensing tests has un- 
deniably been complicated by the existence of medical sects, there 
could be no question as to the dominance, both in the associations of 
medical practitioners and in the Association of American Medical 
Colleges, of the orthodox thought already represented in the leading 
schools. In legal education, on the contrary, there was nothing 
like general agreement as to what was orthodoxy and what was 
heresy. 
The Harvard school was the strongest of the law schools. Its 
famous case method of instruction, with certain resultant conclu- 
sions as to the end and aim of legal education, had long lived down 
its early reputation as a Boston fad. Harvard had been accepted 
as a leader and a model by a considerable number of institutions, 
including most of the larger universities. This point of view was 
certainly already in the ascendant in the Association of American 
Law Schools. Even here, however, sentiment was by no means 
united, and the members of this association numbered, all told, less 
than one-third of the total number of law schools in the country. 
Excluded institutions attacked the Harvard system and philosophy 
on various grounds and commended themselves to many practitioners 
of standing by themselves departing less widely from the original 
ideals of the law office. Entirely apart from attacks based upon 
ignorance and misunderstanding, there was certainly at least some 
plausibility in the charge that Harvard’s adherents were a little too 
uncompromising in proclaiming as the sole purpose of a legal educa- 
tion the development of a “legal mind.” Practical training and 
detailed information in regard to the law of the local jurisdiction 
were among those aspects of a complete education to which these 
schools seemed to be paying too little attention. 
Thus the easily explicable feeling that good law schools were not 
so important as their theoretically-minded professors thought they 
were was reinforced by a suspicion that the theory of education 
exemplified in the leading schools was itself unsound. It can hardly 
be said that there was a rabid partisan discussion over a matter 
in which most practitioners took no interest at all; but prominent 
practitioners at least thought, and sometimes said, that the case
-P-A-G-E-131
  RECENT PROGRESS IN LEGAL EDUCATION 127 
method was a “ fetish,” thereby running the risk of being themselves 
dubbed “old fogies.” 
INADEQUATE BAR ADMISSION REQUIREMENTS 
The lack of harmony between legal practitioners and schoolmen, 
and the further divisions within the ranks both of organized bar 
associations and of law schools, militated against any rapid advance 
of standards in at least two ways. 
First, and most obviously, in contrast with the powerful educa- 
tional machine headed by the Council on Medical Education and 
supported by the great majority both of practicing physicians and 
of medical schools, different groups of reformers in the disorganized 
legal profession each cherished separate ends. Instead of traveling 
together upon a broad highway of progress, each regarded the other’s 
avenue of reform as at best an unimportant by-path—too often as 
one that led in a positively wrong direction. If they united upon 
anything, it was in their tendency to ascribe to practitioners at large 
a cynical apathy, for which the feebleness and confusing variety of 
their own leadership was primarily to blame. 
In the second place, and more concretely, it was impossible under 
these conditions to build up an adequate system of bar admission 
requirements. 
In medical education, however much remained to be done in the 
way of toning up the licensing system, its general principles and 
its objectives were clear. Already the great majority of States posi- 
tively required applicants for admission to medical practice to have 
graduated from a medical school. The State boards of medical 
examiners were designed to supplement this system and to fortify 
the dominant type of sound medical education. In the case of a 
good school their examinations constituted a precaution, additional 
to the tests provided by the school’s own faculty, against failure on 
the part of individual students to take advantage of their oppor- 
tunities. They constituted an even more important weapon of de- 
fense against low-grade medical schools. The boards had it in their 
power to improve or even to destroy such schools by failing to pass 
their graduates or even by denying to their graduates the right to 
| take the examination. Even in 1910 it was probably broadly true 
that good graduates of good medical schools had little anxiety as to 
their ability to pass the medical licensing tests; and although the 
existence of medical sects complicated the task of weeding out in- 
ferior schools, the united profession has been successful in achieving 
the following ends: Schools that profess to be orthodox have been 
assisted to maintain proper standards; if products of an unorthodox 
type of medical education can often secure permission to practice 
 
-P-A-G-E-132
128 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1922-1924 
the healing art, at least they are usually prevented from holding 
themselves out as “regular” physicians. 
By contrast, in the legal profession no single State required appli- 
cants for admission to practice to have graduated from or even to 
have attended a law school. And in the case of applicants who 
attended law schools not the slightest distinction was made, either 
in professional or in popular usage, between “regular” lawyers and 
others. Products of the case-method law school, of the textbook or 
dogmatic law school, and of no law school at all, stood upon a footing 
of precise equality as regards both the process of admission and the 
legal privileges that would be thereby attained. 
The effect of this undiscriminating uniformity was at once to 
exaggerate the importance of the bar examination and—as will be 
shown later—to destroy the conditions under which it can be used 
profitably to measure educational attainments. The examination 
could not be attached to a proper system of preparation as a useful 
supplement because no one knew what a proper system of education 
was. It had come, therefore, to occupy the position of an independ- 
ent educational test; as such it was more seriously regarded both by 
students and by practitioners than the supplementary medical licens- 
ing examination. Having this factitious importance, it distracted 
attention from other devices that are much better calculated to 
promote competence and character among lawyers. Requirements of 
preliminary general education and of a specific period of law study 
were largely ignored because of deluded reliance upon an unsup- 
ported bar examination. 
DIVERSIFIED LAW SCHOOL REQUIREMENTS 
Another complication in legal education, from which medical edu- 
cation is relatively free, had its origin partly in the conditions above 
described and partly in the inherent difference between law and 
medicine. The time that students are required or expected to devote 
to their preparation is only one of many aspects of professional 
education. It is a highly important aspect, however, and because it 
lends itself to measurement by figures it has always been specially 
emphasized both by reformers and by fact-collecting agencies. The 
diversity in this respect among law schools in 1910 was far greater 
than that among the medical schools and imposed a correspondingly 
heavier burden upon those who wished not necessarily to improve, 
but even to understand, legal education. 
Three elements are involved in any attempt to estimate the time 
that a student devotes to his professional preparation. Of these, 
the first and most obvious is the duration of his course in the profes- 
sional school. In this respect the medical course had already become 
definitely standardized at its present figure of four academic years,
-P-A-G-E-133
  RECENT PROGRESS IN LEGAL EDUCATION 129 
and the path was cleared for a movement to add a supplementary 
clinical year. In 1910 every medical school conducted, at least osten- 
sibly, either a complete four-year course or the first half of such a 
course, designed to be completed in another school. In legal edu- 
cation, however, the orthodox period was only three years, and it 
was not until as recently as 1905 that the Association of American 
Law Schools had required its members to comply even with this 
standard. No less than 40 law schools outside of the association, 
or nearly one-third of the total, still announced courses of two years, 
or even of a single year, leading to a law degree. The situation 
resembled that which had existed in medical education immediately 
after the Civil War, before the inauguration of their modern era 
of standardization. 
A second element of equal importance is the time that a student 
devotes to his studies while in the school. Year for year, a school 
which holds its sessions during the regular working hours of the 
day, for the benefit of students who are not engaged in any outside 
occupation, is, of course, in a position to demand much more than an 
evening school run for the benefit of self-supporting students. Just 
how great the difference is can hardly be expressed in precise mathe- 
matical terms. It is possible, however, to state with precision the 
number of medical schools which operated under this very substan- 
tial handicap. The number in 1910 was only 4 out of a total of 140.2 
Very different was the situation in law. As truly here as in medi- 
cine, institutions that held their sessions during the evening or 
during the late afternoon operated under a serious handicap as 
regards their maximum possibility of accomplishment, year by year. 
On the other hand, an argument of some cogency can be made that 
it is of the utmost importance that students of modest means shall 
not be denied access to the politically privileged bar, and that the 
only practicable avenue of preparation for the overwhelming ma- 
jority of such persons is the evening or part-time law school. 
Whether this argument, which is based upon a recognition of the 
peculiarly intimate connection between law and politics, is or is not 
sound, is a question which will be discussed later. The point of im- 
mediate interest is that, whether sound or not, it provides a basis for 
the part-time law school that is lacking in the part-time medical 
school. Incidentally, artificial light does not impair the efficiency 
of instruction in law as much as it does in a subject where laboratory 
work in the natural sciences is required. Again, the amount of 
capital needed to equip something that can pass muster as a 
“school” is vastly smaller in law than in medicine; a considerable

section of the public is ready to believe that a few chairs, a few 
books, and a printed announcement convert an attorney’s office into 
an educational institution. 
These differences between the nature of medicine and of law 
explain why schools which appeal particularly to self-supporting 
students are so much more numerous in the field of legal education. 
Under bar admission rules which give credit for study either in a 
law office or in a law school, offices develop into “schools” so insen- 
sibly that the precise number of these latter can never, in the 
nature of things, be ascertained. If the count be confined, however, 
to institutions sufficiently pretentious to confer a law degree, we find 
that in 1910 no fewer than 60 out of 124 law schools, or almost one- 
half, were either purely part-time institutions or were “mixed” 
schools holding sessions for independent divisions of full-time and 
of part-time students. 
The third element that must be taken into account in estimating 
the time that law-school graduates devote to their preparation is 
the admission requirement of the school—that part of the student’s 
total preparation which he secures before he begins the study of law 
proper. Here there was less difference between the two professions. 
Of the 136 full-time medical schools the great majority—112, or 82 
per cent—had an entrance requirement, at this date, of a high-school 
education or less: Of the remainder, 8 required one college year 
prior to the four-year medical course, a total of five years after the 
high school; and 16 required at least two college years, a total of 
at least six years after the high school. Corresponding to these 
were 43 full-time, three-year law schools, of which again the great 
majority—81, or 72 per cent—had an entrance requirement of a 
high-school education or less, while 4 required one year, 3 required 
two years, and 5 required at least three years of college. Except 
that the law course was one year shorter than the medical course, 
this particular group of law schools conformed fairly closely to the 
full-time medical schools as regards the time that students devoted 
to their preparation. In both groups there was a feeling that the 
time had arrived for increasing entrance requirements among the 
schools generally to the level: already attained by some. This com- 
mon ideal was reinforced by the circumstance that it was in the 
larger universities that the schools with the highest entrance re- 
quirements were usually found.? To this extent medical schools and 
law schools resembled one another in 1910 both in their actual condi- 
tion and in their aims. 
  
® Six universities—Harvard, Yale, Chicago, Wisconsin, Stanford, and the University of 
California—announced, in 1910, an entrance requirement of two college years, or over, for 
both medical and law departments. No independent medical school or independent law 
school required any college work, and many had no entrance requirement at all, at least 
in actual administration. No attempt has been made to distinguish between these cases 
and a genuine high-school requirement.
-P-A-G-E-135
  
RECENT PROGRESS IN LEGAL EDUCATION 131 
But only to this extent. For whereas the 136 full-time, four- 
year medical schools included, as has already been pointed out, vir- 
tually all the medical schools then in existence, the 43 corresponding 
law schools constituted only one-third of the total. The following 
table attempts to make clear how many features besides entrance 
requirements had to be considered if the nation-wide standardization, 
of medical schools was to be duplicated in legal education. The 
numerals with asterisks include all medical schools and all law schools 
that from the point of view of the medical standardizers could 
already be regarded as “orthodox,” on the ground that students 
were expected to devote to their studies their entire time during a 
period of four years in medicine and of three years in law. Such 
schools are shown to be divided into groups that required periods of 
three years, of four years, of five years, and of six years to elapse 
between the date when the student leaves the high school and the 
date when he secures his professional degree. Finally, the number 
of schools that departed from orthodoxy, as regards either the dura- 
tion of their professional course or the time of day at which their 
class-room sessions were held, is indicated by the figures without as- 
terisks. There are 10 such categories, comprising a total of 81 law 
schools, as compared with one similar medical category comprising 
4 medical schools in all. If sweet simplicity and standardized uni- 
formity are indispensable elements in human institutions, in 1910 an 
Augean stable awaited the legal reformer.

  132 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1922-1924 
Il. THE PRESENT 
Legal education has made great advances during the past 16 years 
in all four of the features discussed in the preceding pages. 
IMPROVED ORGANIZATION OF THE LEGAL PROFESSION 
The improvement has been especially marked in the field of pro- 
fessional organization. The American Bar Association has in- 
creased in membership more than sixfold—from 3,690, or 3 per cent 
of the total number of lawyers, to 23,559, or 17 per cent. The gain, 
having been stimulated by an active “drive,” is not all good; the 
percentage of the total membership who attended the annual meeting 
fell from 9 per cent in 1910 to less than 7 per cent in 1925; but 
even so the actual number of members in attendance rose from 326 to 
the imposing figure of nearly 1,700. 
Of more importance than mere size were (1) the establishment, 
in 1915, of a quarterly periodical, which developed in 1920 into the 
present ably edited monthly Journal of the American Bar Associa- 
tion; (2) the beginnings of cooperation with State and local bar 
associations through the establishment, in 1916, of an active Con- 
ference of Bar Association Delegates; and (8) the adoption, in 1919, 
of constitutional changes by virtue of which the former system of 
mutually independent committees and sections has been remodeled. 
Each “section,” including that devoted to “Legal Education and 
Admissions to the Bar,” now chooses that particular “Council of 
the American Bar Association” which is concerned with the same 
subject matter. 
Meanwhile, the Association of American Law Schools has like- 
wise grown from an organization of 37 to one of 61 law schools in 
continental United States, or 63, counting schools in the Philippine 
Islands and Canada. Expressed in percentages, it now includes, not 
29 per cent, but 37 per cent of the total number of schools. Since 
1914 the regular annual meeting of this association, instead of be- 
ing submerged, as previously, in the large summer gathering of 
the American Bar Association, has been held independently during 
the Christmas vacation. This official severance of the two organiza- 
tions has made for much more successful meetings on the part of 
the schoolmen than was possible when their sessions had to be fitted 
into the interstices of the bar association’s program. An antici- 
pated loss of influence with the practitioners was averted by the 
scheduling of a special meeting in the summer of 1920, in conjunc- 
tion with the bar association. Through this maneuver control of the 
machinery of the reorganized Section and Council on Legal Educa- 
tion was placed in hands sympathetic with the Association of Ameri-
-P-A-G-E-137

can. Law Schools. A special committee was appointed to make 
recommendations looking to the improvement of those admitted to 
the bar. The following year the recommendations of this committee 
were adopted by the section and by the American Bar Association, 
and in 1922 were indorsed, with certain modifying interpretations 
and explanations, by the Conference of Bar Association Delegates 
at a special meeting held in Washington, D. C. During these same 
years, 1921 and 1922, the Association of American Law Schools 
specifically indorsed the action of the American Bar Association, 
and brought its own membership requirements into conformity with 
these now orthodox standards; the requisite amendments to its ar- 
ticles of association became fully effective in the autumn of 1925. 
It is significant that in this important movement, as in the still 
more notable organization of the American Law Institute, mentioned 
in the following section, the lead was taken by schoolmen. That 
they should now be so highly regarded as to make this possible is a 
measure of the progress that has been made toward unifying the 
forces of reform. 
Another instance of cooperative effort that may properly be men- 
tioned in this connection was even more directly stimulated by 
developments in the field of medical education. The year 1910 
had witnessed the publication of the Carnegie bulletin, Medical 
Education in the United States and Canada.* Although not written 
by a physician, the data used in its preparation had been secured in 
cooperation with the Council on Medical Education. The volume 
had been warmly welcomed by the medical profession as an aid in its 
successful campaign against inferior medical schools; in addition, 
because of the wide publicity which it gave to this campaign, it 
suggested to lawyers that they might profitably learn from physi- 
cians how to improve their own system of education. The first 
manifestation of this new inclination to follow the lead of a sister 
profession was, naturally enough, an attempt to induce the Carnegie 
Foundation to perform for legal education.a service similar to that 
which it had already rendered in the medical field. During the 
winter of 1912-13 formal requests to this effect were made both 
by the American Bar Association, through its committee on legal 
education, and by the Association of American Law Schools through 
its executive committee. The inquiry was promptly organized under 
the general direction of one whose previous training had been 
acquired in the field of politics or government, rather than in that 
of its technical subdivision, professional law. Practicing lawyers 
and law teachers have contributed generously of their time to give

to the successive volumes published by the Foundation whatever 
merit they possess. The facts that have been accumulated, and 
the conclusions which have been drawn from these facts, have 
aroused general interest in the legal profession. The Carnegie 
Foundation is not engaged in propaganda in support of the views 
expressed by the individual authors of these volumes, or in support 
of any other views. Its studies must, however, be fairly included in 
any enumeration of organized efforts to assist, the progress of legal 
education. 
METHOD AND AIM OF LEGAL EDUCATION 
A considerable advance has been made also toward reaching a 
general agreement as to the merits and limitations of the case 
method. The publication, as part of the Carnegie inquiry, of Red- 
lich’s study of the case method did a good deal to clear up misun- 
derstandings in regard to its nature, and largely dispelled lingering 
doubts as to its essential value. It has now without question dis- 
placed lectures and textbooks as the orthodox method of legal edu- 
cation in this country. 
On the other hand, the primary justification for the method was 
shown by Professor Redlich to lie in the peculiar nature of Anglo- 
American law. Building on this foundation, the view was ex- 
pressed in a subsequent volume of the same series, Training for the 
Public Profession of the Law, that the method was peculiarly appro- 
priate to the United States for the reason that here the law was 
peculiarly confused. The multiplicity of our jurisdictions, each 
with its court of last resort, produces a tangle of legal principles, 
the reduction of which to systematic form has hitherto defied the 
éfforts of textbook writers. Undoubtedly, therefore, the case method 
of preparing law students for their professional responsibilities is 
at present the method that is best adapted to this country. For, as 
its advocates rightly claim, it is the method which best develops that 
power of legal reasoning which is essential, both to practitioners and 
to scholars, in dealing with the refractory material of American law. 
For its full success, however, certain conditions must exist in the 
law schools themselves. Furthermore, even when these conditions 
are present, attention was called to the fact that the necessity of 
employing this valuable but cumbersome method has squeezed out 
  
5 The following three bulletins have been already published for gratuitous distribution: 
No. 8, The Common Law and the Oase Method in American University Law Schools, by 
Josef Redlich, 1915; No. 18, Justice and the Poor, by Reginald Heber Smith, 1919; 
No. 15, Training for the Public Profession of the Law, by Alfred Z, Reed, 1921. A 
fourth bulletin, bearing the title Present-Day Law Schools, is announced as now passing 
through the press. In addition, the Foundation issues an annual pamphlet which reviews 
recent progress and gives certain details as to bar admission requirements and law 
schools.
-P-A-G-E-139
    
RECENT PROGRESS IN LEGAL EDUCATION 185 
of the student’s preparation many elements that it would be desira- 
ble, if possible, to restore. It was suggested that case method 
scholars might profitably turn their attention to the task of making 
our law simpler, and, to this end, engage in the production of good 
textbooks. 
Since the publication of these views, the American Law Institute 
has been organized, in 1923, primarily for the purpose of reducing 
the present chaos of legal precedents to something like intelligible 
form. Should this body accomplish as much as the character of its 
membership and scheme of operation give reasonable ground to 
hope,® it may be that at some date in the far future the case method 
will be valued principally for its service in training legal scholars to 
perform a monumental task. Meanwhile, the suggestion that, for 
training present-day practitioners, the method possesses, along with 
its paramount advantages, likewise certain drawbacks, may have had 
some slight influence both in the schools that employ it and in those 
that do not. The orthodox schools, feeling that an old partisan dis- 
cussion has finally resulted in their triumph, may be a trifle more 
ready to recognize the defects of their qualities, and to consider 
what remedies, if any, can be presently supplied. Schools where 
conditions are unfavorable are perhaps less inclined to make pre- 
tensions inconsistent with the instructional methods which their 
teachers are, and ought to be, actually employing. 
STRENGTHENED BAR ADMISSION REQUIREMENTS 
The basis of the present standard requirements for admission to 
the bar is to be found in certain resolutions that were drafted by a 
committee of prominent practitioners, headed by the Hon. Elihu 
Root, in 1921. As already stated, these resolutions were formally 
adopted the same year both by the Section on Legal Education of the 
American Bar Association and by the association itself. They read 
as follows: 
(1) The American Bar Association is of the opinion that every candidate 
for admission to the bar should give evidence of graduation from a law school 
complying with the following standards: 
(a) It shall require as a condition of admission at least two years of study 
in a college. 
  6 The institute is composed of higher judges and the heads of bar associations, learned 
societies, and association law schools, ex officio, together with a limited list of elective 
members. Its stated aims are “to promote the clarification and simplification of the 
law and its better adaptation to social needs, to secure the better administration of 
justice, and to encourage and carry on scholarly and scientific work.’ At present it is 
devoting a portion of its energies to the preparation of a draft code of criminal pro- 
cedure. Its principal immediate objective, however, is to restate successive branches 
of the law in such form as to relieve the courts from the burden which is now frequently 
imposed upon them of attempting to reconcile conflicting judicial decisions in a large 
number of coordinate jurisdictions. 
 
-P-A-G-E-140
  136): BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1922~—1924 
(b) It shall require its students to pursue a course of three years’ dura- 
tion if they devote substantially all of their working time to their studies, 
and a longer course, equivalent in the number of working hours, if they de- 
vote only part of their working time to their studies. 
(c) It shall provide an adequate library available for the use of the stu- 
dents. 
(d) It shall have among its teachers a sufficient number giving their entire 
time to the school to insure actual personal acquaintance and influence with 
the whole student body. 
(2) The American Bar Association is of the opinion that graduation from a 
law school should not confer the right of admission to the bar, and that every 
candidate should be subjected to an examination by public authority to de- 
termine his fitness. 
Since then these original standards have been somewhat relaxed 
through qualifying interpretations placed upon them by the Council 
on Legal Education. The proposed admission requirement of two 
college years must be read in the light of the following official 
statement : 
A school which admits certain students who do not fully meet the require- 
ments will not be considered as failing to comply with standard (a), pro- 
vided the number of such students does not exceed 10 per cent of its enroll- 
ment. 
Again, for the purpose of applying standard (bd), the council has 
been compelled to face the question, “How long must a part-time 
course be in order to be equivalent in the number of working hours 
to a three-year full-time course?” The following ruling establishes 
an extraordinarily low official figure: 
A part-time course of at least 160 weeks, covering four school years, is the 
equivalent of a three-year full-time course. This action is the same as that 
taken by the Association of American Law Schools on the same problem. 
Finally, although the original standards were in general indorsed 
at a special session of the Conference of Bar Association Delegates 
held in Washington, D. C., in February, 1922, considerable opposi- 
tion was expressed. In order to meet some of the objections the 
proponents of the ratifying resolutions included in them the fol- 
lowing: 
We indorse, with the following explanations, the standards with respect to 
admission to the bar adopted by the American Bar Association on September 
dod. eto. Fee 
Since the legal profession has to do with the administration of the law, 
and since public officials are chosen from its ranks more frequently than from 
the ranks of any other profession or business, it is essential that the legal 
profession should not become the monopoly of any economic class. We indorse 
the American Bar Association’s standards for admission to the bar because we 
are convinced that no such monopoly will result from adopting them. In 
almost every part of the country a young man of small means can, by energy 
and’ perseverance, obtain the college and law-school education which the 
standards require. And we understand that in applying the rule requiring two 
 
-P-A-G-E-141
  RECENT PROGRESS IN LEGAL EDUCATION 137 
years of study in a college, educational experience other than that acquired 
in an American college may in proper cases be accepted as satisfying the 
requirement of the rule, if equivalent to two years of college work. We 
believe that the adoption of these standards will increase the efficiency and 
strengthen the character of those coming to the practice of law, and will 
therefore tend to improve greatly the administration of justice. We therefore 
urge the bar associations of the several States to draft rules of admission to 
the bar carrying the standards into effect and to take such action as they 
may deem advisable to procure their adoption. 
Whenever any State does not at present afford such educational oppor- 
tunities to young men of small means as to warrant the immediate adoption 
of the standards, we urge the bar associations of the State to encourage and 
help the establishment and maintenance of good law schools and colleges, so 
that the standards may become practicable as soon as possible. 
The concluding declaration that these standards are not every- 
where practicable has proved to have greater weight than the opti- 
mistic assertion that “in almost every part of the country ” they are. 
The concession has done more to dampen the ardor of bar admission 
reformers than the initial hortatory passages have accomplished in 
inflaming their zeal. Over four years have elapsed since the passage 
of the original resolutions by the American Bar Association, and still 
not a single State conforms to all of these standards, even in their 
later modified form. Only one State has followed the fundamental 
recommendation that all applicants for admission to. the bar must 
graduate from a law school.’ Only four States require, before the 
period of law study begins, even the equivalent of two years of col- 
lege training.® 
This outcome of recent professional activities has been a disap- 
pointment to some of the participants. If the existing situation be 
compared, however, with that which existed a few years ago, it will 
be found that there are at least three grounds for encouragement. 
In the first place, it is a great gain to have secured even tempo- 
rary harmony among so many professional organizations and 
factions. Hitherto, practitioners and schoolmen, committees and 
sections, national associations and local associations have pressed 
forward on divergent paths toward their common goal. It is not so 
important that they should be surely headed and rapidly moving in 
the right direction as it is that they should now at last be united in 
their search for the true avenue of reform. Whether it be the road 
they are now traveling or another one, they are more apt to find it 
if they search for it together. 
In the second place, false starts should not be regarded as wasted 
efforts. Rather are they an inevitable part of the process of spying

out the land. The present orthodox plan of reforming: the condi- 
tions under which applicants are admitted to the practice of the 
law calls for the imposition of certain uniform requirements. It is 
only on the basis of knowledge gained through this movement that 
it can be determined what are the defects of the plan, whether in 
the details of the requirements or in the attempt to impose them upon 
all applicants uniformly. 
Finally, even though the precise aims of the standardizing organi- 
zation seem now not likely to be realized, their formulation has 
stimulated general interest in the problem among legislators, judges, 
and examining boards. About 20 States have done at least some- 
thing to improve their primitive admission systems. 
PROGRESS IN LAW-SCHOOL REQUIREMENTS 
Among law schools there has been much greater progress, notably 
as respects the aspect of legal education emphasized in standards 
(a) and (6) of the American Bar Association—the time that 
students are required to devote to their studies. The activities of 
the new Council on Legal Education in drawing up an approved 
list of law schools have been reinforced by the increased member- 
ship requirements of the Association of American Law Schools, 
with the result that in two of the three elements involved in this 
time computation there has been a positively spectacular advance. 
The number of law schools announcing a course of less than three 
academic years has been reduced from 40 to 8. The number of 
schools announcing an entrance requirement supposed to be the 
equivalent of two college years or over has been increased from 10 
to 81, or eightfold. The combined effect of lengthening two-year 
professional courses and requiring also preliminary college work 
has been to increase the number of full-time three-year law schools, 
with entrance requirements of two college years or more, from 8 
to 65, or, again, eightfold. This betters even the record of progress 
made in building up medical schools of a roughly corresponding 
type. During the same period the number of full-time four-year 
medical schools with similar entrance requirements increased from 
16 to 74, or less than fivefold. 
Unfortunately for the comparison, this is only part of the story. 
Tt is true that the legal profession, like the medical profession, has 
recently been signally successful in building up schools that demand 
the full time of their students during five or six years. What pro- 
portion, however, do these constitute of the total number of schools? 
In medical sdurtiict such schools constitute 92 per cent of the 
total number. The explanation of this high figure is that the num- 
ber of full-time schools has dwindled from 136 to 79, of which all 
except 5 maintain the standard entrance requirement; and that, of
-P-A-G-E-143
  RECENT PROGRESS IN LEGAL EDUCATION 139 
the original group of 4 part-time medical schools, only a single 
survivor remains. In a word, the favored type has succeeded in 
driving virtually all competitors from the field, with a resultant 
great decrease in the number of medical schools in general. During 
the past few years a similar development has occurred in dental 
education. 
In legal education, on the other hand, the total number of full- 
time schools has increased since 1910 from 64 to 76, or 19 per cent. 
The total number of part-time and mixed schools has increased much 
more rapidly from 60 to 91, or over 50 per cent. These schools, 
which in 1909-10 already constituted nearly one-half of the total 
number of law schools, comprise now 54 per cent of the total. By 
contrast, full-time three-year law schools, with entrance require- 
ments of two college years or more, in spite of their recent great 
increase, to-day number only 39 per cent of the total number of law 
schools. 
The following table, constructed on the same plan as that on page 
26, shows how successful standardizing efforts have been in convert- 
ing nearly all surviving medical schools into a single improved type. 
It also shows how the result of corresponding activities in legal 
education has been an even greater diversification of types than 
existed when this movement began.

This comparison provides food for thought, rather than an occa- 
sion for lamentation. The primary reason for the great variety 
which the table shows to exist among law schools (16 separate 
groups of schools, classified according to student time, as compared
-P-A-G-E-144
    140 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1922-1924 
with 3 groups of medical schools) is that part-time work has not 
only firmly established itself in legal education, but has been affected, 
like full-time work, by the movement to lengthen the law course and 
to increase entrance requirements. This is certainly a salutary devel- 
opment, so far as it goes. Furthermore, although most lawyers and 
law teachers will probably regret that, whereas in 1910 there were 
fewer law schools than medical schools, there are now twice as many 
schools of law, it is difficult to demonstrate convincingly that our 
present machinery for providing legal education exceeds our social 
need. Finally, even the circumstance that a favored type of insti- 
tution, superior to all others as respects the demands it makes upon 
the time of its students, includes only a minority of law schools, 
while the majority all differ widely among themselves, may provoke 
two very different emotional reactions. To those who are unquali- 
fiedly committed to the present standardizing movement, it must, 
as above intimated, seem unfortunate that so many law schools 
decline to be standardized. On the other hand, it is possible that 
here, as in the field of bar admission requirements, the trouble may 
lie, not in inadequate response to reformatory efforts, but in the 
program of reform itself. If this be true, we should welcome the 
experience gained during this period of partial success as a basis 
for making an enlightened revision of plans for the future. 
Ill. THE FUTURE 
In comparison with the situation in which they found themselves 
16 years ago, it is clear that the lawyers have made great progress. 
Judged, however, by their needs or by the record of other profes- 
sions, they still have a long distance to go. Whether because of 
their backwardness, or because of inherent and ineradicable differ- 
ences between law and medicine, they have not been anything like 
so successful as the physicians in building up an effective system of 
professional preparation and supervision. 
In the section immediately following, several of the still unsolved 
problems or unsatisfied needs of legal education will be briefly noted, 
in the same order as in the previous discussion. These will be fol- 
lowed by a more extended treatment of that topic which in its im- 
mediate importance transcends all others—evening or part-time 
instruction and its influence upon the organization of the legal 
profession. 
MISCELLANEOUS PROBLEMS AWAITING SOLUTION 
The American Bar Association, thanks to its successful membership 
drive, enjoys increased financial resources. As an offset to this un- 
doubted gain, it has become too large to be regarded as a select or a
-P-A-G-E-145
RECENT PROGRESS IN LEGAL EDUCATION 141 
compactly efficient body, and yet is not large enough to include, 
among its own members, more than a small minority of the American 
legal profession. Its vigorous but highly anomalous section, or con- 
ference, of delegates from State and local bar associations hardly 
does more than point the way to that more thorough-going adoption 
of the representative principle which has proved such a source of 
strength to the American Medical Association. The Council on Legal 
Education and Admissions to the Bar is a great improvement upon 
the former mutually independent committee and section dealing with 
the same topics; but it still needs a compensated official staff to enable 
it to exert an influence comparable to that of its model, the Council 
on Medical Education. The ably edited American Bar Association 
Journal, with its 60 or 70 monthly pages, constitutes perhaps as heavy 
a dose of periodical literature concerned with matters of general 
professional interest as the average American lawyer can at present 
digest; it compares with the 70 or 80.pages every week that makes 
up the Journal of the American Medical Association. The lawyers 
can show nothing resembling the elaborate studies of medical schools 
and licensing tests that appear annually in the educational and 
State board numbers of this periodical; nor have they anything analo- 
gous to the official American Medical Directory, the latest (1925) 
edition of which lists 161,358 physicians, with information as to the 
education of each and the date at which he secured his license to 
practice. 
The establishment of the American Law Institute is an event of the 
greatest importance in the development of legal research. It marks 
the fruition of 50 years of scholarly labor under the case method. It 
provides a definite objective for hitherto rather purposeless post- 
graduate schools of law. Yet, the aggregate of time and of money 
that is now devoted to legal research of every sort is positively trivial 
to what is spent in medical institutes and medical schools. 
Bar admission requirements, though improving, are still, in almost 
every State, less severe than the requirements for a license to practice 
medicine. The following table reveals the extent to which the States 
conform to certain standards that have been regarded as essential 
both by the American Bar Association and by the American Medical 
Association.

The contrast between the two columns raises a question to which 
allusion has already been made, namely, whether the American Bar 
Association, in its efforts to improve professional standards, may not 
have followed a little too closely the model set by its sister profes- 
sion. But, entirely apart from this question, the situation revealed 
by the last column of the table, taken by itself, can not be justified. 
To take only a single illustration: There may or may not be inher- 
ent differences between law and medicine which make it undesirable 
for the legal profession to enforce, for every lawyef and in every 
State, the standard of two years of preliminary college work made 
essential for “ Class A rating ” by the Council on Medica! Education 
in 1918, and enforced by 38 medical licensing boards in 1925. Con- 
sideration of this question ought not to delay remedies for an evil 
that is scandalous from every point of view. This is that no less 
than 32 jurisdictions do not require prospective lawyers to have even 
a high-school education before they begin their law studies. 
Finally, let us once more turn from the conditions which surround 
the law schools to the schools themselves. Even though the effect 
of the part-time movement upon legal education were entirely ig- 
nored, it is already evident from the table printed on page 17 that 
law schools tend to lag behind medical schools as regards their 
entrance requirements and the length of their professional course. 
As a matter of fact, the disparity in both these respects is decidedly 
greater than there shown, for the reason that more exacting stand- 
ards have been applied in medicine than in law. In computing the 
number of institutions that require at least two college years for 
admission, law schools have been included whose entrance require- 
ments would not be recognized by the Council on Medical Educa- 
tion as complying with their rule. Similarly as to the duration of 
the respective professional courses, a movement for requiring a 
year’s service in a hospital as an interne has resulted in lengthening 
the period of professional training for virtually all physicians from 
four academic years to five. This additional year figures, as shown 
above, in the medical licensing requirements of several States. It 
is also a specific requirement for the degree in several medical 
schools. On the other hand, not only is the legal profession all at 
sea as to the general problem of whether, after preliminary general | 
education and after theoretical work in the law school, an additional 
probationary period of practice can or can not profitably be re- 
quired. Quite apart from this complication, some existing law schools 
which are credited in the table as maintaining three-year or four- 
year courses do so only in a somewhat fictitious sense. It is true 
that this much time must be spent in the school before a student 
may receive the degree. Not infrequently, however, the great ma-
-P-A-G-E-147
RECENT PROGRESS IN LEGAL EDUCATION 1438 
jority of students who are actually in the school come with the in- 
tention of remaining only during that much shorter period which 
will suffice to satisfy low bar-admission requirements. 
THE PROBLEM OF THE EVENING LAW SCHOOL 
Interesting and important as are the considerations sketched in 
the preceding section, the fundamental unsolved problem of legal 
education is now, as it has been for many years: What is to be done 
with that sturdy plant (or, as some would have it, weed), the evening 
or “ part-time ” law school? 
Since evening schools first began to be sufficiently numerous to 
attract attention, four attitudes in regard to them may be distin- 
guished: The attitude of ignorance, of condemnation, of negative 
tolerance, and of positive and reasoned approval of the type, if not 
of its existing representatives. 
The first attitude, which is still embodied in the bar admission 
rules of a great majority of States and accounts in large part for 
the rapid multiplication of these schools, may be briefly summarized 
as follows: As between a law course that is conducted during the 
regular working hours of the day and one that resembles it in all 
respects except that its sessions are held during evening hours, there 
is no substantial difference. Indeed, the advantage, if any, is prob- 
ably with the evening school, for the reason that it is frequented by 
relatively mature and earnest students who are supporting them- 
selves, instead of by boys who devote much of their time at their 
father’s expense to fraternity, athletic, or other outside activities. 
This argument would seek to justify evening law schools by com- 
paring them with poor day schools. It secured no indorsement from 
the Carnegie bulletin, Training for the Public Profession of the Law. 
This volume, although revealing quite unexpected sympathy with 
evening law schools, stated the fairly obvious fact that a student 
who is devoting part of his time and energies to the task of sup- 
porting himself can not give as much time to his studies as one who 
is not, and that therefore the work of an evening law school year by 
year must, of course, be quantitatively inferior to that of a good day 
law school. It was also pointed out that a similar, though less 
marked, inferiority exists in the case of schools that schedule their 
classroom sessions during the late afternoon or at other irregular 
hours of the day, and that the essential distinction is accordingly 
not between “night ” and “day,” but between “part-time” and “ full- 
time ” law schools. These two truths and this not very happy termi- 
nology are now generally accepted by all factions in legal education. 
A second attitude is that of condemnation. For the reason indi- 
cated above, and for other reasons, legal instruction conducted
-P-A-G-E-148
  144 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1922-1924 
during evening hours is regarded, from this point of view, as so irre- 
deemably inferior that it should be discountenanced in one or all of 
the following ways: Directly, through changes in the bar admis- 
sion requirements, or through exclusion of institutions offering such 
work from educational associations; or, indirectly, through insist- 
ence upon increased entrance requirements calculated greatly to 
reduce the number of possible students. It is an expression of this 
attitude, rather than merely a desire to secure a homogeneous or- 
ganization, that has led certain regional standardizing associations 
to refuse membership to colleges or universities that conduct evening 
law work. The same motive was responsible for the adoption by the 
Association of American Law Schools of two now obsolete resolu- 
tions: 
Whereas the maintenance of regular courses of instruction in law at night, 
parallel to courses in the day, tends inevitably to lower educational stand- 
ards: Be it 
Resolved, That the policy of the association shall be not to admit to member- 
ship hereafter any law school pursuing this course. (1912.) 
Hereafter no law schools shall be admitted except upon the condition that 
neither they nor the universities with which they are connected shall here- 
after conduct night classes in law for students preparing for the bar. (1919.) 
The third attitude, tolerance of evening or part-time law work as 
a necessary evil, is not sharply distinguished from the second. It is 
manifested in proportion as those who condemn this type of work 
lose some of their original crusading zeal in the face of the opposi- 
tion they encounter. 
The difficulties that beset those who seek actively to discourage 
part-time instruction have recently been appreciably augmented by 
the promulgation of an educational doctrine that denies their funda- 
mental assumptions. According to this doctrine, there are sound 
social and political reasons, entirely apart from humanitarian or 
“sentimental ” considerations, so called, why part-time preparation 
for the law should be positively encouraged. A reasoned argument to 
this effect appeared simultaneously in 1921 in the Carnegie bulletin, 
Training for the Public Profession of the Law, and in the Root com- 
mittee report which served as the basis for the current standardizing 
movement. As formulated in this latter document, the argument 
runs as follows: 
If the analogy between the medical and legal professions were perfect, we 
should recommend that a three years’ full-time course should he required, 
just as the American Medical Association has recommended a four years’ 
requirement for intending physicians. But the analogy is not perfect. 
In the profession of medicine it is necessary to consider only one question 
with respect to technical education—How can men best be educated to be 
highly skilled physicians? Nothing need be considered unless it relates to the 
technical efficiency of the graduate. 
    
-P-A-G-E-149
RECENT PROGRESS IN LEGA!, EDUCATION 145 
With us, however, the situation is different. The law is a public profession 
by which, more than by any other profession, the economic life and the govern- 
ment of the country are molded. The proportion of lawyers in legislative 
bodies greatly exceeds the proportion of lawyers in the whole population. In 
executive office they are more numerous than are the followers of any other 
profession or occupation. Of course, all men in judicial office are lawyers. 
And last, but of great importance, is the influence of lawyers as practicing 
attorneys in helping to shape the course of judicial decisions and to draft 
statutory and constitutional provisions which vitally affect the law. 
The principle of opportunity for all applies peculiarly to admission to the 
legal profession. The physicians may properly exclude all who do not measure 
up to the strictest requirements of a technical standard. If this results in 
practically confining the right to practice medicine to men in comfortable cir- 
cumstances, the public will not complain, for the public must at all costs have 
highly skilled physicians. But to confine the right to practice law to one 
economic group would be to deny to other economic groups their just partici- 
pation in the making and declaring of law. Such a restriction would prop- 
erly be resented by the public. 
It follows that opportunities must be given to those who are obliged to sup- 
port themselves during their legal studies. If a man has completed two years, 
or, better still, four years, of a college course, he will do best if he attends a 
law school which commands substantially all of his working time. But if he 
has come to the point where he finds it necessary to support himself, and per- 
haps his family, he should not be denied admission to the public profession of 
the law. For such a man the afternoon or evening school is the only resource. 
But in recognizing the necessity for afternoon and evening schools we do 
not recognize the propriety of permitting such schools to operate with low 
educational standards. We should not license a badly educated man to prac- 
tice law simply because he has been too poor to get a good education. On the 
contrary, the democratic necessity for afternoon and evening schools compels 
a lifting of these schools to the highest standards which they can be expected 
to reach. 
This reasoning underlies what has been referred to above as the 
last of the four attitudes which have been adopted in regard to eve- 
ning or part-time law schools. On this basis was erected the com- 
mittee’s recommendation that part-time law schools should be made 
to conform to the orthodox type, by requiring their students to pos- 
sess identical entrance qualifications and to pursue a longer course, 
“equivalent in the number of working hours.” Agreement or dis- 
agreement as to the merits of this recommendation must not, how- 
ever, be confused with agreement or disagreement as to the value of 
the educational doctrine or political philosophy upon which it 
ostensibly rests. On the one hand, the committee’s concrete recom- 
mendations have been supported by many who have not been con- 
vinced by its line of reasoning. Many motives contributed to secure 
favorable action in the American Bar Association, in the Conference 
of Bar Association Delegates, and in the Association of American 
Law Schools. Some members of these organizations were simply 
overawed by the individual distinction of the committee; some saw  
-P-A-G-E-150
  146 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1922-1924 
no incongruity between these proposals and their own unchanged 
convictions in regard to the inherent evil of part-time legal instruc- 
tion. On the other hand, among those who sincerely accepted the 
doctrine of the social value and the educational perfectibility of 
part-time law schools there have been some who from the beginning 
have expressed doubt whether the particular measures recommended 
by the committee are really measures of perfection. 
Their doubts are grounded in the following considerations: The 
great majority of high-school graduates who are not able to attend 
a full-time law school are obliged to support themselves, not merely 
while they are securing their strictly professional training, but also 
during their preliminary college years. It is somewhat open to 
question whether, if such students were to attempt to offset the time 
and energy devoted to earning their livelihood by taking a course 
of preparation, both academic and legal, twice as long as that pre- 
scribed for their more fortunate brethren, they would secure equiva- 
lent educational results. It is quite certain that except in rare 
instances, or under peculiar local conditions, a part-time course that 
is any shorter than this would not suffice. The typical student in 
such a course would certainly not have the opportunity to devote 
to his studies, both inside and outside the classroom, as much time 
as the student in a good orthodox institution commands. Yet it is 
so obviously impracticable to expect self-supporting students to 
devote 10 years to their professional preparation after leaving the 
high school that the Association of American Law Schools and the 
Council on Legal Education have united in recognizing a much 
briefer period as “ equivalent in the number of working hours.” The 
concession means that such schools, so long as they profess to cover 
the same field as good full-time law schools, are simply crystallized, 
as it were, on an inferior level. Educational reformers who depre- 
cate all part-time work may balk at the pedagogical mathematics, 
but they will not dispute this conclusion. 
To practical minds the extent to which an innovation falls short 
of perfection is of less importance than the extent to which it is an 
improvement upon what existed before. From this point of view the 
policy of condoning and covering up an assured inferiority in part- 
time education might be justified if it clearly conduced to the devel- 
opment of a type of institution superior. to the common run of 
evening law schools to-day. Part-time or mixed schools that comply 
with the requirements of the American Bar Association, whatever 
their limitations, should at least be superior to these get-wise-quick 
organizations. 
There is little present indication, however, that these will be re- 
placed by representatives of the new “orthodox ” type as the result 
either of altered bar admission requirements or of the moral pressure
-P-A-G-E-151
  RECENT PROGRESS IN LEGAL EDUCATION 147 
exerted by standardizing agencies. Only two States (Kansas 
and Ohio) have attempted to regulate part-time law schools in 
anything like the manner recommended. The few other States 
that require a preliminary education of two college years 
(always subject to the demoralizing “equivalent”) do not require 
four years of study in an evening law school. The few other States 
which insist upon applicants remaining in an evening law school 
this long do not demand two years of college. The moral pressure 
of the standardizing agencies is the only influence at work. This has 
resulted in increasing the number of part-time or mixed law schools 
which comply, at least nominally, with the new standard require- 
ments of preliminary education and length of course from one insti- 
tution in the year when these standards were adopted, 1921-22, to 
13 in the year 1925-26. Application of the other two standards 
affecting the library and the faculty has reduced to 6 the number of 
such schools that in the autumn of 1925 were officially indorsed either 
by the Association of American Law Schools or by the Council on 
Legal Education. Even this small increase was to only a slight 
extent at the expense of an inferior type of education. During the 
same four years the number of part-time or mixed schools which do 
not even pretend to comply with the time standards has decreased 
indeed, but only from 80 to 78. In several cases where admission 
requirements have been so strengthened as to exclude a considerable 
number of applicants these have been promptly taken care of by the 
organization of a new school in the same city. 
The total number of part-time and mixed schools (excluding, for 
convenience of computation, those offering a law course of less than 
three years), and the attendance at these schools, have varied recently 
as follows:

In interpreting these figures showing a progressive increase, both 
actual and. proportionate, in part-time or mixed instruction, it 
should be borne in mind not only that the figures for “other”  
-P-A-G-E-152
  148 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1922-1994 
schools include those offering a two-year degree course during eve- 
ning or late afternoon hours, but also that professional law courses 
not leading to a professional degree do not appear anywhere in the 
table. In the autumn of 1925 seven part-time sho~t-course degree 
schools and at least nine evening schools which did not as yet confer 
the degree were in active operation. 
THE INFLUENCE OF PART-TIME INSTRUCTION UPON THE ORGANI- 
ZATION OF THE LEGAL PROFESSION 
Whether or not one more or less standardized type of part-time 
Jaw school will eventually drive all others from the field, the present 
régime of competition between part-time and full-time institutions, 
as recruiting agencies for the legal profession, has many unfortunate 
consequences. The most obvious are (1) the flooding of the bar by 
students whose training must in the nature of things be inferior to 
the none too adequate preparation provided even by the best of the 
orthodox full-time schools and (2) the hesitancy on the part of some 
of these schools to raise their present standards, lest the principal 
effect of such action should be to drive students away from them- 
selves into inferior institutions. Although it is too soon yet to profit 
by the full lesson of experience in this respect, there is already some 
evidence that the current standardizing movement is producing this 
precise result. 
There are several reasons why this situation does not excite more 
apprehension than it does. One is a distinct tendency on the part of 
well-trained lawyers—a tendency probably grounded in the very 
merits of their training and subsequent professional career—to take 
life and its evils unemotionally. Another explanation is that, while 
this element has been attending chiefly to its own business, numerous 
graduates of part-time law schools have become established in posi- 
tions of influence in the profession, on the bench, and in legislative 
- halls. Some of these gentlemen have actually remedied the defects 
of their early training. Doubtless all of them think that they have 
done so. With that loyalty to their own past that most of us possess, 
they close their eyes to any changes that may have occurred in the 
jaw or in the conditions of legal practice since they prepared them- 
selves for the bar. Modestly disclaiming any exceptional force or 
ability in their own characters, they take the position that a course 
of preparation which was good enough for them ought to be good 
enough for anybody. They are particularly apt to oppose reforms 
which they suspect, often with some justice, are dictated by a funda- 
mental lack of sympathy with part-time education. 
Perhaps the most important influence, however, that is at work 
perpetuating an inherently indefensible system is a naive faith in
-P-A-G-E-153
  
RECENT PROGRESS IN LEGAL EDUCATION 149 
the efficacy of final bar examinations to stem the torrent. Lawyers 
of every. description, and to an even greater extent the public at 
large, conceive of the flood of ill-trained applicants as breaking, 
so to speak, at the gates of the bar. These gates are manned by 
examiners who are supposed to have power both to exclude un- 
trained applicants from the profession, and in so doing to put an end 
to any type of preparation whose products do not measure up to 
requisite standards. Even the bar examiners themselves sometimes 
seem to believe that the only real evil in the present situation lies 
in the fact that they are obliged to read too many hopelessly bad 
examination papers. 
As a matter of fact, exclusion of the hopelessly incompetent is 
all that can be accomplished under the present system. Any attempt 
to subject applicants to really rigorous bar-examination tests falls 
afoul of the different methods of preparation that are necessarily 
pursued in the two types of law schools. The full-time schools usu- 
ally avail themselves of the opportunity they enjoy to instruct their 
students by the valuable but time-taking Langdell case method. 
The part-time schools, because of the relatively small amount of time 
that their students can spare for study outside the classroom, can. 
use the method, if at all, only in a form so modified as to rob it of 
much of the effectiveness which it possesses when pursued under 
appropriate conditions. Such schools are apt to attempt to make up 
for their deficiencies in this respect by greater emphasis upon what 
their rivals slightingly refer to as detailed “information” with re- 
gard to local law and practice. Both types of schools exert pressure 
upon the bar examiners—pressure that must be regarded as justified 
so long as the law permits both types to exist and to attract students. 
So evenly balanced is this institutional pressure that—as experience 
has shown repeatedly—examiners can not prudently discriminate, in 
their questions or in their system of marking, against either type. 
Yet it ought to be obvious that a bar examination that is not keyed 
to a particular course of study or instruction simply can not be made 
an effective test of competency to practice law. No one has expressed 
this truth better than the inventor of the case method, Christopher 
Langdell. Nearly 50 years ago, combating an early disposition on 
the part of Suffolk County bar examiners to reject his Harvard law 
graduates, Langdell attacked the entire system of examination, 
“without reference to any particular course of study or instruction,” 
in a passage concluding with the following words: 
It is impossible that such examinations should be at once rigorous and just. 
They must admit the undeserving or reject the deserving, and in the long run 
they will be sure to do the former,

In « word, so far from our being able to rely upon bar examiners 
to insure that the products of our various types of legal instruction 
measure up to a common standard of competency, a powerful influ- 
ence is exerted in the reverse direction. The fact that several dis- 
similar types of law schools compete with one another, as agencies for 
recruiting the legal profession, possesses, in addition to the unfor- 
tunate consequences which lie upon the surface, this additional one: 
Institutional rivalry demoralizes the bar examinations. It dimin- 
ishes the likelihood that even for any particular type will there be 
a desirable safeguard on the industry of the students and the 
informed conscientiousness of their teachers. 
It is for this reason that the problem of the part-time law school 
is not merely perplexing in itself, but is of fundamental importance 
in its relation to the future development of legal education in any 
sort of school. The part-time institution, so long as it is constrained 
to be nothing more than a poor copy of the full-time model, is a 
much more subversive influence than the law office. This latter has 
no powerful friends to fight its battles for it. Bar examiners can 
therefore hold its products up to any standard, even to an inappro- 
priate one. In sparsely populated sections of the country this anti- 
quated avenue of preparation can still be justified. In urban centers 
law offices already develop into evening law schools speedily enough. 
It is a question whether it is worth while to expedite a natural trans- 
formation by the adoption of a bar-admission rule definitely refusing 
credit for time spent in an office. 
The first step toward a proper solution of the problem would seem 
to be to abandon the pretense that evening law schools and good full- 
time schools can be made mutually equivalent, either in the amount 
of time that students devote to their education, or in the precise edu- 
cational benefits they derive. It would be much better to formu- 
late, as an objective, that of making part-time schools as good in 
  their way as the best full-time schools now are in theirs. The grad- 
uate of a part-time school can not be expected to have received as 
large an amount of training, measured simply by its aggregate quan- 
tity, as the graduate of an equally good full-time institution. This 
does not mean, however, that the training may not have been as 
profitable, in its different way, nor even that the curriculum may 
not include valuable elements which the other educational type, in 
the pursuit of its objectives, is obliged to exclude. The authorities 
of our leading orthodox law schools, who are doing so much to 
improve our law, already realize how seriously its present condi- | 
tion strains their teaching facilities. Until the law that has to be 
taught is simpler than for many years even they can make it, they 
know how far they must continue to fall short of turning out ade-

quately trained general practitioners. To contend, under these cir- 
cumstances, that part-time law schools should be tolerated only to- 
the extent that they are cheapened editions of their own schools, is 
to ascribe extraordinary virtue to a diluted case method. It would 
be wiser to cooperate with the many earnest graduates of all types 
of law schools who are now teaching law during the evening and 
late afternoon, in an endeavor to answer the following question: 
What methods and what curriculum are actually best adapted to 
part-time conditions? 
An inquiry prosecuted in this spirit should go far to produce the 
type of part-time law school that the situation demands—not an 
institution which everybody, even its own faculty and student body, 
realizes is a makeshift, an inferior imitation of a really good school, 
but something that stands preeminent in its own educational field, 
at once gives its own students benefits that they could secure nowhere 
else, and frees the full-time law school from some of the responsibili- 
ties under which this type of institution now staggers. An attitude 
of this sort would probably find expression among other develop- 
ments in an alternative system of bar-admission examinations. One 
set of questions, intended for full-time law students, could not be 
answered satisfactorily by anyone else; another set of questions 
would be of such a nature that only well-prepared applicants from 
part-time schools could pass the examination. In the course of years 
this might or might not result in a clearly defined division of the 
legal profession along functional lines. Should this development 
occur, it would mean not merely that the profession had split under 
economic pressure into two fairly distinct divisions, recruited respec- 
tively by the activities of full-time and of part-time schools. This 
it has already begun to do to-day. It would mean that, instead of 
attempting by a process of artificial standardization to arrest what — 
philosophers have long recognized to be a mark of social progress— 
a tendency to proceed from uniformity to diversity—legal reformers 
had regularized this tendency and turned it to good account. It 
would not mean that the legal profession was weakened because of 
not being formally united to the extent that physicians and sur- 
geons, general medical practitioners and consulting specialists and 
research workers, are united in a single profession to-day. The 
practice of the law includes a much greater variety of occupations 
than those in which graduates of medical schools engage. American 
lawyers find a closer analogy, not in the relatively restricted medical 
profession, but in a broadly inclusive “health service,” which 
group comprises practitioners of all the many healing arts. If the 
argument by analogy is to be invoked, it is as unreasonable to 
standardize the education and the professional affiliations of every  
-P-A-G-E-156
  152 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1922-1924 
lawyer in one and the same mold as it would be to impose identical 
educational and licensing requirements upon physicians, dentists, 
health officers, pharmacists, nurses, and veterinary surgeons. 
As a matter of fact, all analogies limp. The analogy of health 
service is defective in so far as it suggests that graduates of part- 
time law schools are likely to remain stratified on a plane of lower 
financial or political rewards. Similarly, the existence in France 
and England of two or more virtually exclusive professional groups 
of practicing lawyers is evidence merely that division of the legal 
profession is possible; it is not evidence that the dividing lines in 
this country will ever run as they do there. The problem of the 
American lawyer is unlike that of lawyers elsewhere or of other pro- 
fessions at home. Illustrations drawn from other fields are stimu- 
lating, but in the past there has perhaps been too much superficial 
reliance upon outside models and too little probing of legal fictions 
and conventional assumptions. No one—least of all the present 
writer—can forecast with any confidence how American lawyers 
will be educated and organized in the years to come. But it is at 
least fairly clear that the form and effectiveness of the professional 
organization will be vitally influenced by the existence of differing 
types of educational preparation and that part-time law schools 
will continue to abound and to turn out large numbers of lawyers 
who differ markedly from the product of orthodox full-time schools. 
This conclusion can be rationally derived from our fundamental 
political principles, and such experience as we have tends to con- 
firm the validity of the reasoning.

ART EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES 
By Royat Battey Farnum 
Principal of the Massachusetts School of Art and State Director of Art Education 
Contents.—Art instruction in the elementary schools—In the high schools—Tests in 
art education—The Federated Council on Art Education—The Carnegie Corporation. 
The time between the publication of the advance sheets on art 
education for the biennial survey of 1920-1922 and the present 
document has seen greatly increased activity in this field of educa- 
tion. More clearly defined aims and objectives have become ap- 
parent in the elementary and high schools, and urgent demands for 
training in taste and the essentials of good color and design have 
arisen in unexpected directions. Industry, commerce, and the pub- 
lic generally have awakened to a partial realization at least of the 
social, economic, and cultural value of xsthetic training. 
In fact the awakening has been so effective and widespread that 
to report adequately and completely the past two years’ progress in 
art education would require a good-sized volume. Industrial plants, 
public utilities, retail establishments, business groups, organizations 
such as the Y. W. C. A., Y. M. C. A., parent-teacher associations, 
women’s clubs, and “out-of-school” clubs throughout the country, 
have sought enlightenment on the subject of art as an everyday 
expression. 
Since the problem of training in art understanding is more or less 
similar for all, no matter what the group may be, this bulletin will 
confine itself chiefly to the public-school situation, touching briefly 
upon other developments. 
ART INSTRUCTION IN THE ELEMENTARY GRADES 
Probably the one outstanding mark of progress in art teaching in 
the elementary grades is the serious effort in many cities to study the 
problem from a scientific standpoint. This, no doubt, was brought 
about because of the success obtained in the general education field 
through surveys and concentrated graduate study in colleges and uni- 
versities. If measurement tests, standards, and definite objectives 
of general value to the child were found possible in other subjects, 
153 
 
-P-A-G-E-158
  154 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1922-1924 
it was logical to conclude that similar results could be obtained in 
drawing and art education. 
Proceeding upon this basis a number of school departments have 
taken the matter under advisement and have issued tentative courses 
in art, preliminary to more thorough study. In each case the first 
step would be to appoint a committee composed of (a) persons 
qualified in art outside of the department; () teachers, including 
principals and art director, in the department; (c) art teachers and 
the director or head supervisor; or (¢@) members from all these 
groups. In most cases these committees would make immediate 
studies of the outlines in current use in cities of similar size or 
larger and also analyze their local study courses. This would be fol- 
lowed by careful revisions of the local course, based upon the most 
advanced thought on methods, objectives, standards of attainment, 
general subject matter, etc., as well as other art outlines. Then 
would follow a year of trial, with many carefully devised experi- 
ments, conference discussions, and tabulated results. 
Denver, Los Angeles, Boston, Toledo, Minneapolis, Baltimore, and 
Seattle are typical examples of cities studying the whole question 
from this scientific angle. ' 
The obvious effects upon the art situation as a whole have been 
somewhat as follows: (a) A cooperative effort on the part of all 
teachers really to investigate the problem; (6) the elimination of 
personal opinion on the part of both grade teacher and supervisor; 
(c) more intelligent support of the art program; (@) keener interest 
in results from a purely educational point of view; (e) thoroughly 
professional attitudes on the part of the art teachers and supervisors 
in close harmony with the general educational program; (/) greater 
confidence from all directions in the subject of art. Under these 
conditions art naturally falls into place with other subjects and be- 
comes as much a part of the school curriculum as English. It is no 
longer a special subject. The superintendent and the grade-school 
principals no longer hold aloof, leaving the art supervisor to ‘go his 
own sweet way. He must now function as part of the whole ma- 
chine. 
Being in a more or less try-out stage, the new phase of art educa- 
tion is unsettled, but some of the general objectives would include, 
(a) drawing primarily for self-expression, as a means rather than 
an end; (0) closer relationship to community needs; (c) training 
in appreciation, taste, understanding of art; (d) development of 
orderly habits and artistic skill; (e) education for the profitable 
enjoyment of leisure; (7) art as expressed in the industrial and 
commercial development of the race; (v) self-expression in the life 
needs of the child through the “project method”; (A) discovery 
and encouragement of special abilities. 
 
-P-A-G-E-159
ART EDUCATION 155 
These objectives may appear to be more or less familiar to many, 
and yet during the past two years a much clearer understanding 
of them has been increasingly apparent. Less controversy and more 
general accord have followed. Drawing, for example, has really 
begun to appear as a language. In spite of emphatic statements 
to the contrary, it has been the involuntary custom to look upon 
children’s pictorial expressions from the viewpoint of the profes- 
sional artist. Criticisms of the purity of line and form and of the 
beauty of color have characterized the attitude of observers at ex- 
hibitions and in the classroom. But this point of view has been 
changing, and emphasis has been placed more and more upon draw- 
ing as a story-telling language, vivid with observed, memorized, 
and imaginative possibilities. Public school drawing has unques- 
tionably received a great stimulus in this direction from the work 
with children carried on in the educational departments of art 
museums,! by private individuals, and foreign exhibitions.? The 
result has been greater confidence on the part of the average child 
in his ability to express his thoughts quickly and completely in an 
exchange of ideas. 
Closer relationship to community needs has been increasingly 
evident also. Various annual “campaigns” have served to form 
more or less regular outlets in this direction. English Week, 
Thrift Week, Safety First, Health Crusades, Accident Prevention, 
Humane Week, and many other worthy causes have become in many 
communities a regular thing. Local efforts for the benefit of that 
particular community have also made their contribution. 
The popular and spectacular display of the community poster 
has led some supervisors to curtail their efforts in this field, the 
tendency being to devote too much time, energy, and material to it. 
The unwholesome effect of money prizes has also caused a reaction 
to set in, particularly against the almost innumerable competitions 
promoted outside the community itself. Consequently, the tendency 
has been to localize the effort as in the case of Indianapolis and 
Syracuse, and also to seek other ways of art expression in support 
of community needs. 
Training in appreciation has aided in correcting this danger of 
overemphasizing the poster and at the same time in relating the art 
work to the community. For many years training in appreciation 
of art meant picture study. With the ever-broadening conception 
of art education as a general training for the consumer, the every-

  156 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1922-1924 
day citizen, came a realization that in appreciation must be involved 
also a more general understanding of art. To know some of the 
masterpieces of painting was not enough. Art is universal; it is 
found in the many things surrounding the everyday lives of chil- 
dren. The community in this respect offered a rich field for investi- 
gation, and wide-awake supervisors have taken advantage of the 
opportunity. 
The training of the girls of the Salem Normal School under 
Charles F. Whitney is an illustration in point. Mr. Whitney takes 
them out into the streets of the historic old town, and the girls dis- 
cover for themselves and through his trained eyes and mind the art 
treasures of Salem. Beautiful fences, doorways, knockers, gates, 
windows, spires, and many other expressions of true craftmanship 
are observed, graphically recorded, analyzed in terms of historic and 
modern art periods, and discussed from the standpoint of utility and 
beauty. The barest community will offer something to observant 
eyes. Art thus centers vitally on the community life. 
True appreciation naturally involves a consideration of art in its 
manifold applications. To meet this situation, Boston + has for some 
time, and Philadelphia® recently, provided beautiful illustrations 
of fine art productions housed in the city’s museum for the indi- 
vidual child to purchase and study. Those in Boston are black and 
white halftones; Philadelphia has reproduced very delightful color 
prints, and they include painting,. sculpture, ceramics, textiles, 
metalry, etc. The result of a study of these prints is twofold, (a) 
an increased appreciation of art in many mediums and (0) an easily 
satisfied desire to visit the Museum of Art. | 
To carry on in a comprehensive way this conception of art appre- | 
ciation, Los Angeles offers a very practical suggestion. Miss May 
Gearhart writes: 
  A very important feature of the work in our art department this year is the 
problem of establishing standards of taste by bringing the pupils into contact 
with actual things embodying principles of art. The modern educational ap- 
proach with its emphasis on self-expression necessarily demands a quickened 
effort on the part of teachers in providing experiences that will create an 
awareness of art values. To meet this need the following procedure was 
adopted in the art department by supervisors and assistant supervisors. . 
Hach supervisor drives an automobile when visiting schools—the board of 
education pays the mileage. Equipment for art appreciation discussions is — 
easily carried from school to school in this way. 
These materials are used to illustrate talks on color, form, and arrangement. 
Pupil participation and demonstration insure interest. By slight changes in- 
numerable compositions can be made. We use this material in presenting

problems to the pupils in the classroom, to the teachers at building meetings, 
to the parents at the parent-teacher association meetings. 
The handling and arranging of actual materials beautiful in hue, texture, 
and form never fails to excite interest. 
In addition, the children make class visits to museum and art 
galleries. 
Many teachers have reported increased activity in schoolroom 
decoration as a phase of art appreciation study. In some com- 
munities carefully matured plans for room decoration have existed 
for some time, but unfortunately in too many instances, beyond the 
problem of general selection, nothing vital has been done. Pictures 
and sculpture, like literature and music, are of little practical edu- 
cational value unless properly and adequately presented. A 
“skyed ” reproduction of a Donatello or a Raphael is about as use- 
less as Stevenson or Grieg on the library shelves. Art, to be ap- 
preciated, must become intimate and mentally and spiritually pos- 
sessed. This requires a proper setting and location for study and 
observation. Chicago, under the influence and generous support 
of Lorado Taft, is at last beginning to tackle this problem in a 
big and fundamental way. Ably backed by the school authorities, 
Miss Lucy S. Silke says: 
Interest in schoolroom decoration is more widespread, with greater willing- 
ness to seek the advice of experts in the selection of pictures, ete. The work 
of the Chicago Public School Art Society is a potent influence in this field. 
Recently the board of education, on the recommendation of the superintendent, 
authorized the setting aside of one room in each new school building for 
an art room, and a large space in the front of each classroom free of black- 
board for the display of a fine picture at the level of the children’s eyes. 
Indianapolis also is giving attention to the problem of proper 
exhibition space for pictures, “down on the eye-level” instead of 
above the blackboard, but finds it difficult “except in the back 
of the room.” As a rule, blackboards could be narrowed with- 
out serious hardship, providing some care were given to their effi- 
cient use. Ordinarily teachers fail to apply art principles to their 
work on the blackboard. Attention to better writing and better 
arrangement would tend to economize space and make for legibility. 
Then pictures could be lowered and even set into the upper part of 
the boards. Better still, when walls are designed for their actual 
use, instead of mere roof supports, the question of pictures will have 
some consideration. 
Relative to picture study Indianapolis is “beginning the study 
of pictures in connection with music, the approach being from the 
emotional side or from the standpoint of the expression of the idea.” 
Mr. Dillaway, in Philadelphia, a musician and painter as well as 
art director, uses his flute most effectively in a popular interpreta- 
tion of pictures with the children,

-P-A-G-E-162
  158 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1922-1924 
Reference was made to the orderly use of the blackboard. Un- 
doubtedly orderly habits and artistic skill have received emphasis 
during the past few years. Growing recognition of the values of 
art education on the part of the more recently graduated men and 
women from the stronger teachers’ colleges has brought encourage- 
ment and support to the art supervisor in her efforts to make art 
principles, the elements of order, carry over into the child’s life. 
Art expression requires careful, thoughtful procedure. Efficient re- 
sults in any field require the same habits and mental attention. To 
seek to develop right habits and skill in designing a booklet only 
to forsake the effort in writing the history lesson is not good gen- 
eral education. Art ever seeks its expression in the best, the most 
beautiful way. It therefore enters all the efforts of the child, in 
school and out. 
The project method has both hurt and helped the art training. 
When the right sort of cooperation is obtained, when all forces are 
working harmoniously for the common good, the art work is found 
to be rather fundamental in its bearing upon the situation. When, 
however, the art teacher is used only because she knows how to 
paint or construct a part of the project expression; when sloppy 
results, crude effects, and garish discords are overlooked in the en- 
thusiasms of a project plan, then art education becomes a farce and 
a frill. 
During the past two years the art departments have unquestion- 
ably strengthened their positions because of the project method, but 
until the art specialist is recognized as a necessity throughout a given 
project, that particular project is a failure. For this reason orderly 
habits and artistic skills are receiving more and more emphasis as 
objectives in art training. 
Real teachers of art have used the project method for many years 
without knowing it. Realizing how art enters all expression, they 
have quite naturally utilized any and every means at hand to assist 
in their teaching. For years they were more or less alone. Not 
until modern thought on general education sought to bring together 
all school subjects in a common effort to develop the brain did 
teachers of other subjects realize the value of art teaching to them 
and their work. They found the art teacher capable and ready, and 
then the child began to enter the realm of school education with 
some understanding and delight. Not everywhere, but in some 
places this is true. The past few years have seen greatly increased 
understanding. 
Broader points of view relative to art education, and the attending 
general methods of utilizing subject matter which involve studies of 
the human race through food, shelter, clothing; records, utensils, etc., 
have tended to give emphasis to industry and commerce; and some
-P-A-G-E-163
  
ART EDUCATION 159 
art educators have sought to compass the whole field under the 
term “industrial art.” More recently the term has been enriched 
to fine and industrial art. Other educators have from the first 
maintained that art education is an all-inclusive title and have tried 
not to be carried too far away in their efforts to teach within their 
field the elements of art, the essentials of good design or order. 
Recognizing this as a basic law in all expression, they have felt that 
there is a distinct and definite place for its study, at the same time 
noting its universal application. 
Boston stresses particularly this point of view, and has for some 
years.? Other places take a middle stand, allowing forms of hand- 
work and applied design to enter to some extent the so-called in- 
dustrial art field. Minneapolis and Seattle, possibly, exemplify this 
middle ground, while Baltimore marks the other wing in its con- 
templated new outline. Leon L. Winslow, formerly State director 
in New York, states that in building the new course outline they— 
expect to make use of the valuable related information already embodied in 
the outlines for arithmetic, geography, history, and music. The art course 
will give considerable emphasis to this related information which it will or- 
ganize under the topics of food, clothing, shelter, records, utensils, tools, and 
machines. 
Not until the present healthy and scientific trend in research and 
investigation develops more fact-finding information will art edu- 
eators be able to assemble stable arguments in one direction or 
another. 
Mr. Winslow analyzes the art-education situation in the Depart- 
ment of Superintendence Third Year Book of the National Edu- 
cation Association, Chapter XIII, as follows: 
The ideal elementary-school course of study is, perhaps, one in which the 
entire curriculum is administered on a plan of perfect articulation of the 
various subjects. In such a course the inspiration for handwork is ade- 
quately furnished by the other school subjects. The mission of the subject 
of art in such a scheme would be very largely the providing of illustrative 
and creative handwork. There is no race, no political division, no literature, 
no history, no science which is not intimately associated with the topics 
about which such an elementary art course is organized. In the elementary 
grades, at least, art as.a subject is at the disposal of all other subjects. 
The importance of the work of the elementary school in the scheme of art 
education is sometimes underestimated. If the secondary-school courses in art 
are to function as they should, it is essential that a foundation be laid in the 
elementary schools. A subject designed to meet the esthetic needs of the 
elementary curriculum has already earned a place in many school programs. 
This subject attempts to combine drawing and construction and to substantiate 
and reinforce this drawing and construction by a content closely related to the 
industries, 
Plans for elementary art education consequently include elements from the 
fields of manual training and fine arts, so called, and they aim to provide com-

  tent and experience which shall be of the maximum educational worth. The 
strength of the best programs consists largely in their adherence to the belief 
that all work in drawing and construction should contribute to the pupil's 
personal and social efficiency at the time when the instruction is given. 
Since’ the teaching of art in the schools can not cover effectively the whole 
field of art but must concentrate on problems of immediate value to the pupils, 
it follows that such teaching must function largely through the projects that 
the pupils undertake. An art project consists of a lesson, or a complete series 
of lessons, which has taken into account the necessary thought content, hand- 
work, or appreciation, or all three, to the end that the general development 
of the pupil is assured. Expression should be the result of a definite purpose 
calling for it. The selection of problems and of activities should always be 
made on .the basis of the general educational values as opposed to the re- 
stricted training values. 
A proper use of the project method presupposes training on the teacher’s 
part, and it often includes such things as problems, investigations, assignments, 
reference reading, lesson plans, and textbooks. If other subjects are worthy 
of systematic organization and of sustained intellectual effort on the teacher’s 
and the pupil’s part, the subject of art is also worthy of them. 
    Intelligent investigation takes time and human energy. While 
studies are made, teachers and supervisors must maintain their 
classes and carry on their work. It therefore must be of rather slow 
development, this newer and more scientific presentation of art in 
education. 
ART INSTRUCTION IN THE HIGH SCHOOLS 
The past two years have emphasized the differentiation in the 
work of the junior and senior high school and the grades. Proba- 
bly there has been less change in subject matter than in point of 
view; and, as in the lower grades, clearer aims and objectives have 
become apparent. 
As a rule art is a required subject in the junior high school -but 
is still elective in the senior high school. There is, however, a grow- 
ing tendency to urge the requirement of a general art appreciation 
course for all freshmen in the senior high. This being the year 
when the greater number leave, and also the period of unsettled 
conviction as to the final course to be pursued, most supervisors feel 
that all students should receive some understanding in the art prin- 
ciples which they will continually use throughout their lives. In 
the New Trier Township High School, Kenilworth, Tll., such a 
course is required in the sophomore year. 
C. Valentine Kirby, director of art for the State of Pennsylvania, 
has prepared an art appreciation course for his State, covering three 
years of the senior high school." This includes many of the subjects 
covered in briefer, less comprehensive courses which separate high 
schools offer throughout the country.

ART EDUCATION 161 
Both junior and senior high schools are placing considerable 
emphasis on the question of art appreciation, and in so doing there 
is a growing tendency to urge the actual manipulation and creation 
of forms studied. Teachers and students are no longer content to 
read about art or merely to see it. True educational experience car- 
ries with it the doing of things. 
Professor Whitford writes :* 
   Actual production assists greatly in teaching appreciation and the true 
worth of the objects studied. Exercises may be undertaken in this connection 
in drawing and design, pottery and tile work, bookmaking, wookwork, leather, 
metal, cement, or in any of the crafts or industrial arts. Carefully selected 
historical material should also be studied wherever possible for comparison, 
enlightenment, and a knowledge of the evolution of art objects and processes 
and the effect which these have had on modern products. Assigned reading 
and study should be carefully planned to open up an industrial, historical, 
and social outlook with regard to art and to present important selected facts 
to the pupil in an easily assimilated form.

burgh, Rochester, St. Louis, and Somerville, and devoted to the ques- 
tion of present practices in the administration of subjects offered in 
grades 5-9, inclusive, indicate that “General Art Appreciation ” and 
“Taste and General Culture ” lead all other art education courses. 
In referring to the situation,» Mr. Winslow, of Baltimore, remarks 
that: 
We may fairly conclude that at the present time most junior high school art 
work is being offered professedly for the sake of the development of general 
art appreciation, taste, and general culture. 
At the same time most teachers of junior high schools recognize the 
special aptitude or vocational objective as essential to the junior 
school program. This is the “try-out ” period, and in all art courses, 
for appreciation or otherwise, the teacher is alert to the capacities 
and capabilities of the students in this field of study. 
The new junior high-school buildings are making special provision 
for the art departments; and in the larger cities more especially op- 
portunities are offered for expression in various kinds of crafts. 
The effect upon the general education situation appears to be three- 
fold: (a) The school authorities become alive to the importance of 
art in its manifold applications in the junior high school program 
and begin to realize for the first time the far-reaching effect of edu-

cation through beauty in production; (4) the children gain a new 
point of view in their school training, a new sense of values, and 
understanding of the relationship between principles on the one 
hand and practice on the other; (c) the community, through the 
parents, is awakened to the immediate value of esthetic training, as 
evidenced by the artistic product from the school studio or shop and 
the more intelligent attitude of the boy or girl in his purchasing 
expeditions. The briefest contact with a community maintaining an 
efficiently organized junior high school art department shows at once 
this wholsesome result, according to many reports. It is no less true 
where well developed senior high school art courses are found. 
This idea of applied art is, of course, no new thing. The arts and 
crafts have existed for some time, but more recently there has been 
greater emphasis placed upon concrete material expression than ever 
before. Volume XXI, No. 1, of “The Sierra Educational News” 
was issued as the “ Arts and Crafts Number,” containing a national 
symposium on the question; the project method has forced the appli- 
cation of art principles not only to single forms but even to all the 
details of dramatic and musical performances carried out by groups 
of children; and special courses based upon the home, the costume, 
etc., make constant demand for practical application. 
In the foreword of the new Boston Syllabus in Art for High 
Schools,?° it is stated that: 
The new note in education is motivation. Conferences with the superintend- 
ent, head masters, and with heads of departments have made us realize that, 
if art is to have its proper place in the programs of our secondary schools, it, 
too, must be more generally motivated. It is with this thought that the 
committee has prepared its syllabus. It has enlarged upon fundamentals and 
motivated courses and emphasized the cultivation of taste, which is the right 
of every educated person. 
The forward movement of art in high-school education has led to 
a number of perplexing problems, now for the first time, perhaps, 
forced into the open. Following the general theme of motivation, 
the Boston outline continues in its introduction as follows: 
The art work of each high school should be differentiated to. meet the needs 
of the students in the different courses; in other words, it should be moti- 
vated. It should touch the lives of the students so intimately and the different 
vocational and academic courses so positively that its need will be obvious. 
To this end, the art work in the Boston high schools is planned around three 
centers—the individual, the home, and the vocation, or the future training of 
the student. That the work of the art department may be purposeful it is 
essential that students of like courses be grouped in their art work as well as 
in the major subjects of their choice. Until drawing is required in at least 
two years in the general high school and is an elective in the third and fourth 
years, it is impossible to plan courses which can be followed as outlined.

ART EDUCATION 163 
Herein lie two of the problems needing to be solved; first, the 
| adequate differentiation of subject matter, and, second, the proper 
_ grouping of students. Professor Whitford offers in his suggested 
“ Outline for General Arts Courses” ™ seven different topics, as fol- 
lows: (1) Study of buildings (civic and general architecture, sculp- 
ture); (2) study of permanent equipment (real estate); (3) study 
of home furnishings (personal property) ; (4) study of printing and 
advertising (commercial art); (5) study of personal apparel; (6) 
study of decorations for special occasions (art for drama); (7) 
study of vehicles and transportation. Under each of these topics 
are listed a great many objects, and he goes on to say: 
The citizen of to-day has a definite, even if vaguely defined, responsibility 
for the approval or disapproval of practically all of the objects mentioned in 
the foregoing list. Upon the citizen of to-morrow will rest the setting of stand- 
ards for new objects and works, and for replacements. 
Involved in the same problem of differentiation is the problem 
of administration. For years art classes have been the last to be 
organized in the schedule; and then, except in the very large schools, 
students representing all years have been herded together. This 
has naturally made it very difficult for the art teacher to organize 
her work and practically impossible to give well-ordered class in- 
struction. Until classes can be organized by years, or by the degree 
of proficiency in the subject, the proper development of differen- 
tiated courses will be a difficult one. At present the attempt is too 
often made to offer different courses for individual students, partly 
to “hold them,” partly to foster talent. 
ART CREDITS 
Another high-school problem confronting the art department of 
the high school is the very important one of credits. For years the 
art classes have been the last scheduled and have been given. least 
consideration from every angle. The more recent attempts to classify 
and rightly place the subject in relation to the school’s curriculum 
in a number of places has immediately raised the question of its 
value in terms of points or credit. The situation is handicapped, 
for secondary schools training primarily for the advanced profes- 
sional colleges, as is usually the case, are extremely loath to give 
credit for subjects not recognized for entrance into the advanced in- 
stitutions. Here is a real difficulty in the minds of most principals. 
Until the colleges and universities, therefore, recognize high- 
school art and drawing courses for credit on entrance examinations 
or on certificate, the tendency will be to retard credit recognition 
in the secondary school itself. Some schools overcome the problem 
  
11 Sch, Rev., Vol. XXXII, Nos. 5 and 6, May and June, 1924,  
-P-A-G-E-168
  164 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1922—1924 
by dodging it. They offer two courses, one for college, the other 
for students not planning to continue their education. Thus, the 
good student with excellent brain capacity, who should have a 
broad general and cultural training preceding the higher education, 
finds it impossible to devote any time to the question of art. 
The importance of the question led to two questionnaires being 
formulated and tabulated by Minna McLeod Beck, M. A., director 
of art at Harrisburg, Pa.1? These questionnaires dealt with “ Some 
Difficulties Encountered by Art Education,” and were sent to 61 
cities. 
The questions pertaining to secondary schools dealt with the value 
of art, recognition of art in relation to other subjects and credits. 
In the summary printed and distributed by the American Crayon 
Co. the following statement is made: 
It is without doubt agreed by all working in the high-school art field, with 
the exception of a very few favorably situated, that art education is laboring 
under difficulties and that these difficulties, in the main, have to do with 
Jack of recognition and credit given in the high schools, and lack of ac- 
ceptance of art credits by colleges. It is, however, admitted that in some in- 
stances the art courses offered by high schools (colleges also) are not worth 
credit or recognition; therefore the need for standardization of art courses. 
Fifty-three colleges and universities responded to the questionnaire. 
These questions related to the sizes and conditions of art depart- 
ments, to propaganda, and credits. The conclusions formulated © 
after studying the returns are as follows: 
It would seem that the matter of college entrance requirements is holding 
back art advancement both in the colleges and high schools. There is a 
reaction one upon another here. It would seem, also, that the matter of 
credits allowed is another disturbing factor. What can we do about this? 
Is it a matter that depends, for its adjustment, upon the evaluation of our 
subject matter and its recognition by college authorities? At which end 
shall we begin? 
Concerning the issue relative to standardization of art courses—dare we 
face this issue? Some one has already said, in replying to the questionnaire, 
“You have started something.” And yet, is it not possible to get together on 
important questions? Is it not possible for art educators to agree among 
themselves upon something like a standard course of art study? 
Until we do form: some sort of coalition, presenting a united front; until 
we can offer a consecutively worked out and consistent course of study—one 
offering undoubted content value, one that, from the standpoint of modern 
pedagogy, may be approved by our greatest living educational authorities— 
can we, indeed, expect much consideration, or even a modicum of what, in 
our injured souls, we call “fair play”? 
And speaking of educational experts—we need the help of these educators— 
we can not work out our salvation alone. They have a contribution to make 
to our work, like that they have made to other subjects. If once they be-

come convinced that art education, rightly conceived and rightly taught, holds 
amazing possibilities—and, should they investigate these same possibilities, 
we may be sure they will champion our cause. 
TEXTBOOKS 
Any course in art appreciation requires a considerable amount 
of illustrative material. It also involves reading and research. This 
naturally brings about a demand for prepared work on the part of 
the student, and a textbook is inevitable. That this is true is. evi- 
denced by the extensive use of the “Apollo,” * and some places are 
adopting lists of accepted textbooks. New York State has such 
a list, and recently the following was issued in Baltimore: 
The board of school commissioners of the city of Baltimore, Md., has re- 
cently adopted a list of five textbooks on art subjects to be used by pupils 
in the junior and senior high schools. The list includes the following: 
Brown’s Applied Art; Degarmo and Winslow’s Essentials of Design; Nor- 
ton’s Hlementary Freehand Perspective; Varnum’s Industrial Arts Design; 
Bement’s Figure Construction; and Neuhaus’s Art Appreciation. It is the 
policy of the Baltimore art department to recommend the adoption of suitdble 
textbooks, in so far as suitable texts can be found, for each of the art sub- 
jects offered in the junior and senior high schools.

Mention should also be made of the action of the State of Mis- 
souri in appointing a committee, headed by Jean Kimber, of Harris 
Teachers College, St. Louis, to prepare a new high school art course 
which will probably be off the press this year. 
No city has taken a more forward step in ‘the field of art edu- 
cation recently than New York. For some time there has been a 
growing need for more adequate facilities to carry on art work, if 
it is to be permitted to grow and expand with the city. The fol- 
lowing is the gist of an article which recently appeared in a New 
York paper: 
JEROME AVENUE SITE CHOSEN BY CITY FOR ART CENTER 
The Reservoir Tract of 200 Acres to be Developed at Cost of $15,000,000; Outdoor Opera 
Provided 
The sinking fund commission selected the Jerome Park Reservoir 
tract of 200 acres as the location for a great educational, music, 
and art center, including an outdoor opera and a bandstand for 
concerts, to be developed at a cost of $15,000,000. Superintendent 
Gompert, in a letter to the city chamberlain, states that at the 
southerly end of the tract was assigned a site for Public School 86, 
Bronx, and an athletic field, and at the northerly end a site for 
the De Witt Clinton High School and an athletic field. Between 
these sites remains a large tract for the proposed music and indus- 
trial art high school. He recommends that the city retain per- 
manent ownership of the entire tract. 
Such a move as this and on such a tremendous scale must do a 
great deal to encourage and support art education elsewhere in both 
elementary and secondary schools. If carefully organized and 
conducted the New York art center should become the model for 
many other city art education developments. 
TESTS IN ART EDUCATION 
Standardization in art training has been developing interest: in 
various parts of the country, a natural outcome of the success in 
attainment tests in other subjects. Two recent experiments are 
noteworthy in this field. 
The Kline-Carey test ‘4 is a carefully worked out series of rep- 
resentation drawing scales by which the child’s drawing ability may 
be estimated. This consists of a number of pictures by children, 
graded, after being judged for position in a numerical scale, by 
many experts throughout the country.

trude L. Carey, Johns Hopkins Press, Baltimore, 1923.

The art appreciation test, by Erwin O. Christensen and Theodore 
Karwoski, of the University of North Dakota, deals with the realm 
of applied design and is still uncompleted. However, a bulletin 
on it is published * and gives to date the findings of the experiments. 
In the foreword it states that: 
A test in art appreciation that functions should make it clear that art 
appreciation is a definite thing, which can be measured without doing violence 
to any personal factor involved which is not reached by the intelligence tests. 
The “test is based on two main ideas—on the ability to react sensi- 
tively to the aims of the artist and to discriminate between inferior 
and superior art quality.” It consists of a considerable number of 
mounted reproductions in black and white and color of paintings, 
architecture, sculpture, abstract design and color, applied design in 
posters, furniture and home furnishings, wall papers, illustrations, 
and advertisements. The student is asked to check the test by ° 
drawing— 
two circles for each judgment; one around (A) or (B), etc., and one around 
one of the reasons, which are numbered (1), (2), (3), (4), ete. Only one of 
these reasons is right. All others are wrong or do not apply. Select the one 
you think is most right. 
A typical test in painting offers two pictures (marked A and B) 
with the following information to be checked:

3. It represents the prairie.

THE FEDERATED COUNCIL ON ART EDUCATION 
Another important and, it is to be hoped, far-reaching movement 
in the interests of art education in the United States is the recent 
organization of the Federated Council on Art Education. For 
many years art organizations have given considerable time and en- 
ergy to the consideration of the many problems involved in art 
education, but the papers, discussions, and committee work have 
borne little fruit. Each association did its own work independently 
of the others; there was no united plan. Meantime the important 
questions of credits and standardization were pressing their needs, 
and when the Beck questionnaire was rounded up it gave impetus

to a unification of effort in the closing paragraph of the pamphlet, 
where it said: 
In offering the results of this questionnaire may I make the following sug- 
gestions: Z 
1. That the Eastern Arts Association, the Western Arts Association, the 
Nollege Arts Association, and other bodies having to do with art instruction 
in the schools appoint committees to meet and confer upon the problems of 
art education and the best way to solve them. 
2. That these committees later confer with leading educational experts from 
our great universities to the end that, if possible, “ effective art education” may 
be defined. 
In the spring of 1924 the Western Arts Association adopted at its 
annual convention resolutions seeking to bring about some organiza- 
tion whose business it would be to bring to a head the various educa- 
tional questions confronting the different art associations. These 
resolutions were presented and adopted at the annual meetings of 
the Eastern Arts Association, the American Federation of Arts, and 
the American Institute of Architects. In each case representatives 
were appointed and in December of that year the Federated Council 
on Art Education was formed to study, investigate, and report on the 
art education problems which individually the associations had 
been considering. Since that meeting in Chicago, the American 
Association of Art Museum Directors, the College Art Association, 
and the Pacific Art Association have joined the council, 
THE CARNEGIE CORPORATION 
Finally, and perhaps more significant than any other one move- 
ment for art education this country has yet seen, is the recent an- 
nouncement of the activities of the Carnegie Corporation. Con- 
siderable sums of money have already been granted through the 
recommendations of President Frederick P. Keppel to several col- 
lege art departments and to art organizations,,including the Fed- 
erated Council on Art Education. But even more important is the 
policy of the immediate future to study art in relation to the Ameri- 
can public and to use its funds and influence in thus promoting art 
in America. 
Such a movement must at once give courage and support to the 
art teacher, professor, and supervisor, and to the educational work 
for which he or she stands. Presidents of colleges, principals, super- 
intendents, boards of education, and teachers and the public 
generally must realize the growing recognition of the great value of 
art education in the immediate and future lives of the children and 
to the State and Nation at large. America may thus take her 
rightful place in art education among the nations of the world.

GENERAL RECOGNITION OF THE VALUE OF INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION 
Industrial education in some form is as old as the industries 
themselves, but it has been only in the past dozen years that the 
public schools have undertaken in a serious way to incorporate 
courses in vocational industrial education in their program of stud- 
ies. With the breakdown of the old apprenticeship system and with 
the growing realization of the need for some effective method of 
training to help the great army of industrial workers better and 
more quickly to adjust themselves to their life work, it was pro- 
posed to make it a responsibility of the public schools to offer at 
least some service in adjusting transition from school to work. 
The arguments for and against this proposition were the results of a 
difference of opinion between two social groups—the first believing 
that the purpose of public education was to contribute to culture 
and to the enjoyment of leisure and life satisfactions of the indi- 
vidual, and the second group holding that public education should 
emphasize vocational objectives and regard the development of the 
economic productive ability as worthy of attention. 
Only during the past 10 years has the point of view of the believ- 
ers in the social importance of effective vocational training of less 
than college grade resulted in a sufficient body of crystallized public 
opinion to support a widely diffused and highly developed program. 
Naturally, the rather sudden initiation of such a broad program 
was accompanied by acrimonious discussion and doubt as to its suc- 
cess on the part of many workers in the educational field. It is 
highly gratifying to note that during the past two years much of 
this discussion and confused thinking has ceased. There is an 
increasing tendency to regard the whole educational program as 
169
-P-A-G-E-174
  170 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1922-1924 
conducted essentially for the purpose of promoting progress and 
stability of our democratic form of social organization. Much liter- 
ature has appeared during the past two years that has directly or 
by implication set forth the conception that the ultimate standard 
by which any form of education must be measured and evaluated 
is the degree to which it contributes to effective adjustment in our 
form of social organization. 
TYPES OF INDUSTRIAL WORK AND OBJECTIVES 
In the United States the term “industrial education” is frequently 
used to designate everything from the simplest form of bench work 
in the elementary schools to full-time trade-school work and the 
work done in training departments of industrial plants. This broad 
use of the word often leads to considerable confusion, especially since 
certain types of industrial education are classified as industrial arts, 
manual arts, or manual training. <A decision as to the classification 
of industrial work should be based upon the nature of the objective 
- set up for training. 
The objectives for industrial-education courses are best defined on 
bases of function. What contribution does the training offered in 
one of these courses make toward qualifying one to perform any of 
the life activities which require on some level manual dexterity and 
knowledge for its performance is the first question that should be 
asked in determining what courses shall be offered and to whom 
they shall be offered. During the past two years there has been an 
increasing tendency to define objectives in terms of ability to per- 
form worth-while activities. 
The important objectives for industrial courses which are gen- 
erally recognized are as follows: 
1. To train the hand and eye in the intelligent use of tools and 
materials through certain fundamental operations which it is well 
for an individual to be able to perform, regardless of his occupation. 
2. To develop an appreciation of constructive work with different 
types of materials, in order that the individual may be a more in- 
telligent consumer, regardless of his occupation. 
3. To gain an insight into and an appreciation of some of the 
important industrial arts, in order that the pupil may make an 
intelligent choice of an occupation. 
4. To develop ability to perform a variety of practical tasks suffi- 
ciently well to meet general social demands and the needs of home 
life but not necessarily up to the standard of occupational practice. 
5. To prepare an individual for profitable and advantageous en- 
trance into employment in a definite industrial occupation, with the 
status of an advanced apprentice.
-P-A-G-E-175
  
INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION 171 
6. To provide an opportunity for those who have already entered 
occupations to add to the knowledge and skill which they already 
possess, in order that they may become more expert workers, with 
increased earning capacity and a better chance for promotion. 
Some general education values will accompany the realization of 
any of these specific objectives, but they will be especially pro- 
nounced in connection with the objectives suitable for the elementary 
grades. The first four objectives are or should be those of manual 
training or manual arts departments in the elementary schools and 
junior and other high schools. There is considerable evidence to 
support the statement that the fourth objective is recognized to an 
increasing degree as one of the most socially worth-while objectives 
for industrial arts and manual training courses. The last two are 
specifically vocational objectives and should characterize the work 
of every school or class that claims to be vocational. The fifth ap- 
plies to the full-time trade extension evening schools, and in most 
cases of part-time trade extension classes. 
Work which has a vocational aim necessarily has definite and 
clear-cut objectives, and it is unquestionably true that the clear 
definition of aims and purposes of vocational schools and classes is 
reacting upon nonvocational work in shop subjects and tending 
toward a clearer definition of the aims and purposes of such work. 
While some progress has been made along this line in the past two 
years there is still great need for further improvement in the defini- 
tion and aims in the whole field of industrial arts and manual train- 
ing. Definite objectives must be set up in terms of abilities to 
perform some specific life activities in these lines and which will 
qualify one for normal living experience. 
THE ALL-DAY TRADE SCHOOLS 
During the past two years there has been a slight increase in the 
number of of the all-day trade schools and in the enrollment in such 
schools. During the year ended January 30, 1924, the total enroll- 
ment in all-day trade and industrial schools, federally aided, was 
33,262. Of this number, 27,012 were boys and men and 6,250 were 
women and girls. It is generally recognized that the all-day or 
full-time school is a rather difficult type of school to establish. This 
is especially true in cities where the high schools are predominantly 
of the academic type, with the emphasis upon college preparatory 
courses. In such a situation the tendency is for the children. com- 
pleting the elementary school either to go to the regular academic 
high school.or to leave school and go to work. Regardless of the 
fact that the great majority of high-school pupils enter employment 
either before graduation from high school or soon after graduation,
-P-A-G-E-176
172 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1928-1984 
the idea still prevails in many cities that the best type of high-school 
work to offer is that type which is especially approved by associa- 
tions of colleges and secondary schools. 
Where this situation exists it can not be expected that any great 
numbers will be attracted to a school the avowed purpose of which is 
to give training in some specific trade for advantageous entry into 
employment. When under these conditions an attempt is made to 
meet the needs of young people of high-school age prior to entrance 
upon employment there is, in a great majority of cases, more or less 
of a social stigma attached to those who enroll in the trade school. 
Because of this and other difficulties surrounding the full-time day 
trade school on a preemployment basis, there has been a marked tend- 
ency to develop trade training on the cooperative plan, whereby 
boys alternate between work and school every week or every two 
weeks. While there is’ considerable evidence that the tendency is 
toward establishing cooperative part-time and apprentice training, 
the full-time school, as such, is still an important type of institution 
which, in many cities throughout the country, is doing an important 
and valuable work. The tendency toward an increase in part-time 
and cooperative apprenticeship training under an alternating plan, 
however, is unmistakable and will undoubtedly increase. 
TYPES OF FULL-TIME TRADE SCHOOLS 
The existing trade schools may be grouped into three principal 
classes, as follows: (1) Separate schools as a part of a city system 
of public schools; (2) departments in high schools; (3) State trade 
schools. 
Under suitable conditions as to organization and administration 
the separate trade school has a fair chance to succeed. The voca- 
tional department in the general high school as a rule has a difficult 
time in maintaining its work on a strictly vocational basis in the 
academic atmosphere which usually characterizes the city high 
school. 
In some instances, the attempt to establish vocational departments 
in high schools has had to be abandoned. However, there are 
numerous instances where such departments are fairly successful 
and are doing efficient work. The success or failure of such de- 
partments depends, at least in part, upon the attitude of the school 
officials and the high-school principal and his staff toward it, and 
varies with different school systems and different types of school 
organization. 
Where State trade schools have been established they have as 
a rule been remarkably successful. The State of Connecticut is 
definitely committed to the idea of State trade schools. Without
-P-A-G-E-177
TNDUSTRIAL EDUCATION 1738 | 
any reflection upon any city trade schools and vocational depart- | 
ments in high schools, it can fairly be stated that no full-time trade 
schools anywhere in the country are more efficient than the eight 
trade schools in the State of Connecticut. Within the past two 
years definite trade courses have been established at the State School 
of Science at Wapheton, N. Dak. This school being apart from the 
academic atmosphere of the city high school is free to set up defi- 
nite trade courses. In the limited number of trade courses thus 
far developed the work is eminently successful. 
OTHER TYPES OF ORGANIZATION 
The State of Wisconsin has enacted laws and adopted policies 
which make it possible to develop vocational education in that State 
upon a somewhat different basis than is possible in other States. 
With its State apprentice law, its industrial commission, and separate 
boards for industrial education, it is possible to set up vocational 
schools which are in no way hampered by traditional standards. 
Probably one of the most efficient schools in the United States is 
the Milwaukee Vocational School. During the past year this school 
enrolled for courses in the day school a total of 16,355. The maxi- 
mum number in attendance at any time in the day school was 11,272. 
The total number enrolled for classes in the night school was 6,397. 
It must be borne in mind that this, in the main, is a part-time school. 
The great majority of the students were in attendance but one day 
of eight hours per week. 
The foregoing school includes the following departments: Ap- 
prentice, rehabiliation, “permit,” and full-time commercial. Ap- 
prentices are required to attend one-half day a week until they 
have completed 400 hours of schooling. The work, in the main, 
is related to their shop work. Occasionally some shop work is done 
in the school. In the permit division the students are required to 
attend eight hours a week until the end of the quarter following 
their eighteenth birthday. Approximately half of their time is 
devoted to academic work, some of which is related to the voca- 
tional work. Boys are given opportunity of selecting vocational 
work preparatory to apprenticeship in about 50 lines. 
SCOPE OF THE WORK 
A recent publication of the Federal Board for Vocational Edu- 
cation lists 158 distinct titles of courses offered in full-time day and 
part-time trade extension schools. The great variety of instruction 
offered indicates that these schools are to an increasing degree meet- 
ing the vocational needs of the people. No one is justified in mak- 
27301°—27——_12
-P-A-G-E-178
    
174 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1922-1024 
ing the assertion that the work of trade schools is confined to five or 
six of the skilled trades. Such a statement would have been true 
_ eight years ago but not so now. 
EVENING SCHOOLS 
The growth of evening trade extension schools and classes has 
been steady during the past seven years, and during the year 1924 
the rate of increase has been somewhat greater than the rate for the 
previous year. The enrollment in the evening schools receiving 
Federal aid was, in round numbers, 85,000 for the year 1924, or 
more than two and one-half times the enrollment in day trade 
schools. 
The eighth annual report of the Federal Board for Vocational 
Education lists 135 distinct courses as indicating the scope of even- 
ing school work. The United States Census report for 1920 lists 
11 general groups of occupations. They are: Food and kindred 
products; Textiles and their products; Iron and steel and their 
products; Lumber and timber products; Leather and its finished 
products; Paper and printing; Chemicals; Stone, clay, and glass 
products; Vehicles for land transportation; Railroad repair shops; 
and Miscellaneous industrial occupations. Persons from each of 
these general groups have been enrolled in evening classes. For 
most of the general groups various numbers of distinct courses have 
been offered—more than 20 in some instances. The fact that 6,000 
coal miners were enrolled in evening trade extension classes in 
mining subjects during the year 1924 indicates the development of 
evening school work, and shows the need for organizing specific 
courses that are of practical value for the occupational improve- 
ment of employed persons. 
APPRENTICESHIP FOR THE SKILLED TRADES 
Apprenticeship for the skilled trades is recognized as constituting 
a problem that must be solved. During the past two years there 
has been a notable revival of interest in apprenticeship on the part 
of employers of labor, manufacturers, architects, engineers, and 
others whose interests are affected by the shortage of skilled work- | 
men. The revival of interest in apprenticeship is not confined to 
any one line of work, although it is very pronounced at present in 
connection with the building trades. Much is being accomplished in 
the promotion of plans for efficient apprenticeship training, not 
only in the building trades, but in the various machine and me- 
chanical trades. As modern conditions make it impossible to revive 
the old system of apprenticeship, it is more and more recognized
-P-A-G-E-179
  INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION 175 
that the new apprenticeship, to fit modern conditions, can be most 
effectively operated through cooperation with the public schools. 
Experience indicates that the problem involved in apprenticeship 
plans can be solved only where there is cooperation on the part of 
at least three groups, viz, the employers, the workers, and the public 
schools. Each of these is an interested party to any apprenticeship 
raining program. Each has certain peculiar and inherent interests 
in any program to be developed, and in addition has certain other 
cooperative interests common to the other parties. The interests of 
o one party can be fully developed without the other. This neces- 
itates the setting up of a definite unified objective for an appren- 
iceship course which will embody the best interests of all parties. 
n the old apprenticeship days the employer was responsible not 
nly for the trade education but also for whatever general educa- 
ion the apprentice was to receive. The parents as interested parties 
o the contract aimed to secure both of these benefits to their child. 
wing to the changed condition in the industries and to the exten- 
ion of public education, it is incumbent upon the public schools to 
ssume responsibilities in connection with the training of appren- 
ices. 
As this work has developed, organized labor has shown conclu- 
ively that it is ready and willing to cooperate to the greatest pos- 
ible extent in the promotion of effective apprenticeship training. 
his is not to be wondered at in view of the fact that real labor 
eaders have always been in favor of the thorough training of ap- 
rentices and have always lent their support to programs of voca- 
ional education under public control. At this time it is not possible 
0 give definite figures showing the development of apprenticeship 
lans. 
The fact that the State of New Jersey is cooperating in a pro- 
ram of education and training for 2,000 regularly employed ap- 
rentices is indicative of the development which is growing through- 
ut the country. Cleveland, Ohio, has more than 1,200 apprentices 
nrolled in the building trades and this year graduated a class of 
50 who completed not only their job training but the courses given 
n the schools covering the technical aspects of their trades. Brick- 
aying is one of the trades in which there has been notable success 
n increasing the number of apprentices through the cooperation of 
mployers and labor. This is evidenced by the fact that in July, 
921, there were 1,427 apprentices and on June 1, 1925, there were 
1,602. 
While the promotion of apprenticeship is essentially a problem 
0 be worked out locally, a very effective background for local devel- 
pment is created through the cooperation of national and State 
rganizations of employers and workers. During the past two years    
    
    
    
    
   
      
   
       
     
       
    
    
  
-P-A-G-E-180
  
  176 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1922~1924 
school officials and employers and workers’ organizations have held 
a number of joint conferences of a national or State character for 
the promotion of apprenticeship programs. The Federal Board for 
Vocational Education has attempted to encourage local initiative in 
the development of local programs to meet local needs and at the 
same time has made important contacts with National and State 
organizations to back up the program. Among the important or- 
ganizations with which cooperative work has been. done are the 
following: The American Construction Council; the Associated Gen- 
eral Contractors of America; the Bricklayers, Masons, and Plas- 
terers’ International Union; the Mason Contractors’ Association ; the 
National Association of Sheet Metal Contractors; and the National 
Granite Association. In many cases local development has been 
promoted because such national organizations have indorsed the pro- 
gram. The Federal Board for Vocational Education has had a num- 
ber of conferences in which representatives from all the interested 
groups have participated. 
With the growing conviction that education for any particular 
individual is for the purpose of adjusting that individual to society, 
there is a manifest tendency to establish fewer part-time schools of 
the general continuation type and to establish more offering practi- 
cal courses for training in some phase of the life activities found in 
the trades and vocations. As a clearer comprehension of the func- 
tion of part-time education is developed the courses for the employed 
youth enrolled in these schools are becoming more and more of a 
vocational nature. 
The type of general education as found in the grades and high 
schools is not adapted to the work of the part-time school, especially 
for the older boys and girls from 16 to 18 years of age. There is a 
manifest need for making the work for these older boys and girls 
more directly related to their vocational needs as determined by 
their employment. Whether or not the work of the part-time school 
is looked upon with favor where it has been established depends 
largely upon the organization and types of courses that have been 
offered. The more nearly the courses are organized to meet the 
needs of employment the more favorable is the local attitude toward 
the part-time work done in the public school. 
Probably the greatest development in apprenticeship training has 
been in connection with the building trades. During the year 1924 
there were in Federal-aided classes alone more than 20,000 persons 
enrolled for apprenticeship and trade-extension courses in the build- 
ing trades. Five thousand were enrolled as apprentices and students 
in day trade schools, taking trade preparatory work. Fifteen thou- 
sand were employed persons taking trade-extension work.
-P-A-G-E-181
  
INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION 177 
These figures are indicative of the tendency to establish courses 
in the part-time schools which more nearly meet the vocational needs 
of these employed persons. Many of the part-time schools and 
classes have been of the general continuation type, but as the possi- 
bilities of the part-time school as an agency for meeting the practi- 
cal needs of the apprentice on the job are more fully realized the 
tendency is to offer courses which are more strictly vocational. 
Especially is this true for employed students more than 16 years of 
age. The courses organized for such students should be largely 
to meet their vocational needs. For this older group the function of 
the part-time school is to give definite preparation for vocational 
work and for advancement in employment. The success of the part- 
time school and the attitude of the local community toward it will 
_be determined largely by the degree to which it realizes these objec- 
tives. For the pupils in the part-time school who are under 16 years 
of age more of the general continuation type of school work can be 
given successfully. 
LEGAL PROVISIONS AFFECTING PART-TIME EDUCATION 
Twenty-five States have enacted some form of part-time compul- 
sory education laws. In other States the spending of money for 
part-time classes and for vocational education purposes has been 
legalized. The age of required part-time attendance by the laws 
of the different States varies, but the majority of the States place 
the lower age limit at 14, two States at 16, and one at 12. The 
upper age limit for attendance varies from 14 to 18. The hours 
of required attendance per week vary from four to eight. The 
number of weeks of required attendance usually approximates the 
full school year. The minimum number of minors required to 
establish part-time classes varies in the different States from 12 to 
2,000, the majority of States requiring no more than 20. 
Not only has there been an increase in the number of States which 
have enacted part-time compulsory school laws, but there has also 
been considerable extension of general education requirements. For 
example, Wyoming, in 1923, raised the age of compulsory education 
to 17 years. Nevada now requires full-time attendance to the age 
of 18. New York State has extended its part-time law to include 
towns between 4,500 and 5,000 population. This extension of the 
period for compulsory education is significant for industrial educa- 
tion in that many students who had formerly been going into em- 
ployment are now by the hand of the law retained in school for at 
least a part of the year. It is the function of industrial education 
to aid in providing for the needs of this particular group. Three
-P-A-G-E-182
  
178 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1922-1924 
million children between 14 and 18 years of age are out of school. 
Three hundred thousand of them are 14-year-old boys and girls, a 
half million are in the 15-year-old group, and those 16 and 17 years 
old number more than 2,000,000. In the course of time more and 
more of the children who are now out of school altogether will be 
kept in school for a part of the time. It will be the duty of indus- 
trial education to help formulate a program for them that will be 
worth while in helping them to make proper adjustment to social, 
economic, and industrial life. 
It is well known that the percentage of the school population 
going to high school is increasing. In 1900 only 3.3 per cent of 
the enrollment in the elementary and high-school grades was in 
high school; in 1920 the corresponding percentage was 10.2; in 
1922 it was 12.3. This increase in high-school enrollment gives an 
added responsibility for the further development of industrial 
courses to meet the needs of the increasing numbers whose chief 
interests are along industrial lines. This principle works both 
ways. Increased high-school enrollment not only creates an obli- 
gation for further development of vocational courses to meet the 
needs of those whose interests are along industrial lines, but the 
introduction of vocational courses increases the percentage of enroll- 
ment in the secondary schools. 
Although only 25 of the States have enacted laws which provide 
for compulsory part-time school attendance by employed minors 
between certain age limits, a number of continuation schools have 
developed in States which have no such laws. Some of these schools 
are among the best part-time or continuation schools in the country. 
This leads us to the conclusion that the success attained in the estab- 
lishment of part-time schools is largely a matter of education of 
the local community to an appreciation of the value of such schools 
for meeting the needs of the employed minors. 
During the fiscal year ended June 30, 1922, the total enrollment 
in Federal-aided part-time schools of all types was 228,555. The 
-enrollment for the same schools for June 30, 1924, was 321,188, 
of whom 256,133 were enrolled in part-time schools of the general 
continuation type. | 
It is a debatable question whether the best way of establishing — 
continuation schools for employed minors is first to get a law 
through the legislature; second, attempt to enforce the law; and, 
third, educate the public sentiment in favor of part-time education. 
Experience seems to indicate that a more logical procedure is first 
to create public sentiment in favor of part-time education by dem- 
onstrating its value in specific cases. Following this it is relatively 
easy to secure the necessary legislation to make it universal through-
-P-A-G-E-183
INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION 179 
out the State. If this procedure is followed, the question of enforce- 
ment becomes of minor importance, and it is possible to maintain 
continuation schools without running into conflict with public 
opinion. 
MANUAL WORK, NOT VOCATIONAL 
There is great confusion in the use of terms to designate manual 
and industrial courses other than those of a strictly vocational char- 
acter. The terms “manual arts,” “mechanic arts,” “industrial 
arts,” “mechanical arts,” “practical arts,’ and “manual training,” 
as well as a number of other terms, have been used frequently to 
mean the same thing and again to mean different things. In order 
to avoid the confusion resulting from the use of any of these terms, 
one large city school system is using “ manual education” to cover 
all forms and phases of the work involving manual manipulative 
processes. Another large city, with an excellent program in this 
field of education, has issued a very commendable monograph cover- 
ing all objectives and courses, under the term “industrial educa- 
tion.” Included are courses for all manual activities beginning with 
the fourth grade and continuing through the senior high school. In 
connection with the descriptions of the courses, the fourth, fifth, 
and sixth grades are placed under the heading “elementary manual 
training ”; the work for the seventh, eighth, and ninth grades (the 
junior high-school period) is listed under the title “ prevocational 
industrial education”; and that for the senior high school under 
“vocational and nonvocational education.” Although the term 
“manual training ” is still to be met, it is no longer in general favor. 
It is not meant to deal here critically with the use of these terms, 
but to point out the fact that there is lack of agreement as to nomen- 
clature for designating work of a manual and industrial type, not 
vocational. It is to be hoped that out of this general confusion such 
an urgent need for standardized designations for different phases 
and levels of the manual work will be felt as will lead to some co- 
operative effort on the part of those responsible for the use of such 
terms and result in the adoption of a terminology that may meet 
with general approval and become standardized. 
The same general confusion found to exist with reference to ter- 
minology is also apparent with reference to subject matter and aims 
for the different courses offered in the manual arts type of work. 
There is no general agreement as to the variety of work to be offered 
or the values to be realized in specific courses for the different grade 
levels. Some individual systems have given careful consideration to 
the selection of courses and to specific worth-while objectives, but 
there has in general been a lack of appreciation of the real need for
-P-A-G-E-184
  180 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1922-1924 
careful definition and evaluation of the work to be done. Too often 
the courses selected and the aims set up are the result of tradition 
rather than of scientific investigation. Past practices and procedures 
- are still too influential in determining content and aims of instruc- 
tion. Asa result of this situation money for equipment and instruc- 
tion, as well as the time of the students, has been spent upon some 
types of work that are of doubtful value. For example, it is the 
judgment of some whose opinions are to be respected that many 
schools still place too much emphasis upon woodwork of the old 
type. 
Forces are at work, however, for the correction of these short- 
comings in the manual arts type of work in the public schools. The 
development of the definite objective for vocational industrial edu- 
cation courses as training for entry upon employment in some spe- 
cific trade is forcing serious consideration of the place and value of 
manual arts education in our public-school program. Probably the 
greatest factor contributing toward the solution of the problems 
dealing with the selection, content, organization, and aims of such 
courses is the application of the principles of modern scientific cur- 
riculum making. Modern ideas of curriculum building, laying stress 
upon the development of specific abilities through natural forms of 
experiences, are doing much to change the conception of manual arts 
work from that of formal exercises of the old manual-training type 
and with general training objectives to that of practical activities of 
a project nature qualifying one to perform specific life activities. 
Another corrective force exerting its influence for the clarification 
of subject matter and methods in the manual arts work is the better 
understanding and application of the psychology of interest and of 
habit formation. The application of the psychology of interest to 
the selection of activities for manual work has led to the development 
of more project work and less of the formal exercise work. In addi- 
tion, it shows the need of selecting for each grade group projects of 
a kind and on a level with the pupil’s interests. The making of 
kites, sailboats, bird houses, radio sets, and many other articles to be 
used in connection with the pupil’s leisure-time activities, and the 
performance of many production and service jobs found in connec- 
tion with the home and community life are now commonly accepted 
practices. A better knowledge of the psychology of habit forma- 
tion is leading to less stress upon transfer values of the manual arts 
courses and to more emphasis upon the acquisition of definite types 
of manual experiences and industrial information. The work done 
in these courses must itself contribute specific values for meet- 
ing some normal living experiences. 
 
-P-A-G-E-185
  
INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION 181 
HOME MECHANICS 
As a result of the effort to give training that will develop abilities 
to meet successively normal living experiences, there has been con- 
siderable shifting and changing, both in the content of the courses 
' in the manual arts and in its organization for instruction purposes. 
At present, the home-mechanics course is in considerable favor, as it 
organizes the manual work of the school upon a practical basis and 
affords opportunity for training in a variety of elementary, funda- 
mental processes which qualify one for performing many of the 
repair and maintenance jobs of the home and community. Some 
school systems are organizing almost all the work offered above the 
elementary grades on this basis. This is especially true for the 
smaller school systems where trade shops can not be maintained 
on account of their cost. A number of State departments of educa- 
tion are holding regional conferences within their States for the 
purpose of developing courses in home mechanics. In such con- 
ferences emphasis is placed upon the values to be derived from such 
courses and is given to working out local programs with suitable 
content material. Special emphasis is placed upon the selection of 
projects that are of practical value in ordinary home life and which 
will appeal to the interest of the pupils, and whose learning diffi- 
culties are on a level comparable with the pupils’ accomplishments. 
THE GENERAL SHOP 
The general shop as an organization for instruction is in consid- 
erable favor, especially for the junior high-school period, where all 
the activities are given in connection with one-shop organization 
under the direction of one teacher. Some of the advantages which 
may be derived from such a general shop organization are: 
1. It brings together, in one-shop organization, activities dealing 
with a variety of materials and processes. It makes possible the com- 
pletion in one shop of a project which is of special interest to the 
student. This is of value in that one teacher, interested in the boy’s 
work, can direct his activities for all the work done on the project. 
2. It makes possible the acquisition of a large amount of indirect 
experience covering a variety of activities and processes. Work 
organized on the one-shop basis affords opportunity for observation 
of the work of other students on various activities far beyond that 
which would be possible in a one-activity shop. Such experiences 
extend very considerably the trade and industrial knowledge of the 
boy. 
3. The shop training and experience resulting from performing 
operations upon a variety of materials and the use of a variety of 
 
-P-A-G-E-186
  182 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1922—1924 
tools qualify the pupils to do various jobs connected with home and 
community life. Many of these can be used as projects in the gen- 
eral shop and are valuable in that they represent activities found in 
normal living experiences. 
4. The work of the general shop may serve as preparatory work 
for young pupils who will later enter upon trade courses. 
5. Through the possibilities offered for the discovery of aptitudes 
and interests the work of the general shop serves in the realization 
of the “ trade-finding ” objective of the manual arts work. 
It is the opinion of some who have made a thorough study of the 
work of the general shop, particularly as found in the junior high 
school, that it is destined to play an important part in manual arts 
activities in the schools. This is especially true for schools which 
are limited in number of pupils and in rooms and equipment. Some 
of the unsolved problems are: Properly qualified teachers, proper 
methods for handling and distributing materials and tools, and 
proper methods for organizing instruction materials and the use of 
proper teaching methods. 
Sometimes the general shop is organized on the basis of a cycle 
of shops, the pupils rotating through a number of one-activity shops 
for a given period in each. Here, also, the pupils are offered a 
variety of experiences, but which are more specialized along specific 
trade lines. This scheme is of particular value in senior high schools 
where the work is so arranged as to be of value for preparatory and 
trade-finding purposes. 
As an example of this type of general shop organization the scheme 
followed in a large well-organized senior high school may be cited. 
In this particular school the general-shop boys are given during their © 
freshman year a six-week period in each of six shops: Plumbing, 
printing, auto repair, machine shop, electrical work, and woodwork- 
ing. In each shop the boy is given as definitely as possible an inti- 
mate contact with the work of the trade. Advantage is taken of 
various opportunities to get to the boys information about the trade 
or industry which can not well be given in the shop or classroom by 
ordinary methods. Motion-picture films are used regularly. At the 
close of the six-week period each group is taken on a shop trip to a 
plant which is typical of the work just finished in the shop. At the 
end of each shop course the boy is interviewed by his instructor and 
given an opportunity to express himself freely in regard to his 
experiences. 
The time given to the manual arts type of work and the variety of 
courses offered, as revealed by an examination of the courses of study 
of a large number of school systems, is convincing evidence of the 
value of such work as a part of a program of studies for the accom-
-P-A-G-E-187
  INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION 188 
plishment of the objectives of the school. Forward-looking steps will 
be in the direction of the further refinement of aims and content in 
school courses to meet more definitely some of the specific objectives 
embodied in the public school program. 
PRIVATE AND CORPORATION SCHOOLS 
Following the signing of the armistice there was a marked decrease 
in the program of training in industry which had been built up dur- 
ing the war. A great majority of the vestibule schools disappeared 
because they were no longer necessary. Although there was no great 
shortage of ordinary factory workers, there was and still is a 
shortage of highly skilled workers. Naturally, the best types of cor- 
poration apprentice schools were not eliminated at the time of the re- 
adjustment, but, on the other hand, these schools have grown and 
developed to a point in advance of anything heretofore found in the 
field of privately supported vocational schools. Large corporations 
can afford to run their own vocational schools in the same way that 
they can afford to maintain their own fire departments. The majority 
of individual plants, however, are not large enough to support 
regular apprentice schools such as many of the railroads maintain 
and such as are found in the large mechanical and electrical manufac- 
turing plants. There is, therefore, a considerable need for agencies 
other than private corporation or apprentice schools to provide 
equally efficient training for those who will find employment with 
‘similar organizations. The full-time trade school and the part-time 
cooperative apprentice school are meeting this need in part. The 
work of such schools is supplemented by correspondence schools and 
private and semipublic schools. 
The entire matter of vocational training is in process of adjust- 
ment and unquestionably will be carried on in the future in such 
ways as are most efficient and result in the lowest net cost to society. 
To an increasing degree, it is recognized that training costs money. 
An employer can not evade this cost by looking to some one else 
to train his men for him. If the teaching is provided by public 
schools, he will have to pay his share by means of taxes levied 
to support such schools. If he trains his own men, he will pay 
for the service more directly. If he attempts to get along without 
training any men, and discourages’ publicly supported vocational 
education, he will eventually have to put up with a supply of 
incompetent or half-competent workers. Their inefficiency on the 
job and lack of skill will probably, in the end, cost him more than 
would participation in an organized training scheme. If he is to 
continue in business, he can not get along permanently with semi-
-P-A-G-E-188
  184 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1922-1924 
skilled and unskilled workers; consequently he will have to face 
the fact that semiskilled and unskilled persons will have to acquire 
training for the job while in his employ. From the present situa- 
tion in industrial training, it appears that for many occupations 
certain phases of training can be given more efficiently and at less 
cost on the job than in any form of school. On the other hand, 
there are types of training which can probably be given better 
at less cost, and with greater social values in public schools. How- 
ever, there are innumerable cases where the most efficient and less 
expensive plan involves some type of cooperation between industry 
and the public schools. Notwithstanding the fact that examples of 
such cooperation are increasing at a remarkably high rate, a begin- 
ning has hardly been made in solving the problem.

AGRICULTURE IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS 
The place that instruction in agriculture should occupy in the 
program of the elementary school is a question on which there is 
much difference of opinion and marked divergence of practice. A 
generation ago there was considerable agitation for a better adjust- 
ment of the rural school to its environment, and most students of 
rural education apparently accepted the view that instruction in 
agriculture should be a part of the program of the elementary school. 
A recent report by a committee of the American Association for the 
Advancement of Agricultural Teaching states that 28 States require 
that agriculture shall be taught in the elementary rural schools. 
Textbooks published to meet the demand for this type of instruction, 
and outlines prepared to assist teachers, show clearly that the training 
of students for rural occupations was the chief end sought. Improve- 
ment of farming was the uppermost object. 
In recent years much consideration has been given to the objectives 
of the elementary school, and numerous curriculum studies have 
been made. As a result there is much less certainty on the part of 
many regarding the desirability of the type of instruction in agri- 
culture that was originally introduced into the elementary school. 
More ‘careful analyses of the economic and social implications of 
such a program of instruction have also contributed to the recognition 
of the undesirability of using the elementary school in the rural 
community as an agent of propaganda for making farmers and 
farmers’ wives of boys and girls who chance to live in the open 
country. 
One of the most challenging philosophical discussions of the use of 
the elementary school for directing children toward farm life has 
been written by Dr. O. G. Brim.t Doctor Brim has gathered from a 
large number of educational writers statements that show the very

general acceptance of the vocational objective in agriculture for the 
elementary rural school. 
Those who have most fully imbibed the urban, economic conception of the 
farmer-group see the rural child as a producer only and his social service mainly 
in terms of food. Guided by this idea, one who desires the school to realize the 
most efficient citizenship from the community states that the “distinguishing 
mark of efficient citizenship in the rural community is skill in the production of 
food.” This conception of the rural child as a producing factor in the rural 
occupation has stimulated various lines of endeavor. ‘Agriculture must be 
taught, because that is to be the occupation of most of the pupils of the rural 
school, and because the school can greatly increase their efficiency on the farm.” 
“A thorough course in manual training is highly desirable and useful,” because 
“the modern farm with its variety of machinery, tools, special type of buildings, 
drainage systems, concrete construction work, etc., taxes the ingenuity of the 
farmer.” Industrial club work, junior projects, home project study, and vitalized 
agriculture—limited almost entirely to rural occupational problems, empha- 
sizing economic return and maximum physical product, and fostered by agri- 
cultural interests from the adult point of view—are indeed being largely accepted 
as the solution of the rural school problem. These are believed to offer a satis- 
factory educational content for the rural child. 
It is evident that many of these writers have misconceived the purpose of 
elementary education and the essential characteristics of a life that is good for 
the child and desirable for a democratic society. They ignore the fundamental 
task of elementary education, which is to make the child a member of society in 
the fullest sense. They aim from the first to make him a member of a group. 
They emphasize the differences, the qualities wherein his parent group is unlike 
- others, instead of strengthening the bonds that unite him to all peoples. They 
center his attention upon local problems, instead of creating interests for him 
common to the groups with whom he must cooperate. They develop occupational 
ability rather than ability to participate in the problems of social progress; and 
then complain because he is not given a place in governmental affairs. ‘‘Society 
must advance toward the ideal democracy of which we dream through a broaden- 
ing of the range of suggestion that floods the individual.’”’ Yet many would 
doom the rural child, already handicapped in his contact with the world, to a 
rural diet in his school experience. It is of primary importance to society and 
to the individual that each be free and intelligently prepared to choose his own 
field of work. But instead of meeting this fundamental provision, these men 
determine the child’s future upon the accident of birth, and use the institution 
dedicated to his larger growth as a means of limiting his vision and determining 
his choice. 
The development of a six-year elementary school and the growth 
of the junior high schools have contributed to a clarification of the 
aims of education for these school periods. Though the two forms 
of school organization have not yet been adopted widely in rural 
schools, the fundamental conceptions back of their growth are 
influencing the view regarding the functions of the elementary 
school in the rural community. It seems very unlikely that there 
will be any general return to the conceptions regarding the purposes 
of instruction in agriculture in the elementary school that have 
prevailed during the past two or three decades.

This does not mean, however, that the vocational objectives no 
longer are held, or that there is general agreement regarding the 
outcomes to be sought through instruction in agriculture. The 
following data regarding the purposes of instruction in agriculture 
in the seventh and eighth grades, recently collected and compiled 
by F. J. Smeeckle,? are evidence on this point:

E. E. Windes * points out the present confusion regarding the aims 
of agricultural instruction in the elementary schools, as follows: 
In no other field of educational endeavor are conditions so chaotic as in the 
fields of elementary-school agriculture. Courses of study are found outlining 
lwork for each of the eight elementary-school grades, providing a continuous and 
comprehensive program. Other courses are found which outline work for a 
single grade only and limit instruction to the consideration of a few problems in 
gardening. Between these two extremes every degree of comprehensiveness as 
to time and content may be found. 
Avowed aims are equally variable. Definite vocational training is sought in 
some cases. A vague cultural aim is frequently phrased. Occasionally a con- 
scious effort to make the course in agriculture the center of the elementary- 
school curriculum, and the dominant farm enterprise of the State the center of 
the agricultural course, is made. 
Practically every method known to teaching practice is found. Occasionally 
there is an effort to apply the problem-project method to elementary-school 
agriculture, making the natural interest of the pupil a basis for choice of prob- 
lems and local conditions the controlling factor in content and sequence of sub- 
ject matter. The usual situation, however, is that a young girl with little 
training, academic, technical, or professional, hears the class read from a text, 
eligiously avoiding discussion. 
In spite of the lack of clarity of objectives for this phase of the 
lelementary-school program, there is but little doubt, as has been 
indicated, that the movement in recent years has been away from 
the vocational objective. Students of the problem are accepting 
ithe view that, instead of using instruction in agriculture in the ele- 
entary school for vocational ends or as propaganda for farm life, 
it should take its place as a part of the program of instruction for 
? From an unpublished study.

vocational and educational guidance, or the “teaching for choice.” 
Evidently this view is almost diametrically opposed to the one that 
has been commonly accepted, at least until very recently. It is 
much more nearly in harmony with the ideals of a democratic society 
than its predecessor. One writer‘ has set forth the reasons for 
rejecting the old aims of instruction in agriculture and placing it on 
a broader basis, in the following statement: 
Determination of capacity for economic service on the part of every prospective 
citizen is quite as important under a theory of democratic organization of society 
as it is under a theory of state socialism. Equality of opportunity is fully as 
dependent on such determination as is the efficiency of the state, for, in the theory 
of democracy, self-realization in and through vocation for the individual is of 
equal or greater significance than his efficiency in the production of a margin of 
utilities for social consumption, whether of commodity or of service. The 
achievement of efficiency as a productive unit in the social organization is not, as 
it is under the doctrine of state socialism, the prime objective of selection for 
economic capacity. Thus, in a country like ours, any means to such determina- 
tion must place election before selection. Indeed, choice in itself is an essential 
element in any equalization of opportunities. All that a democratic society can 
do is to provide for the prospective citizen the basis in experience necessary to 
make his choice genuine or intelligent. 
In the light of the foregoing thesis the proposition which has been put forward 
by many and earnest advocates, that the function of formal education in the 
rural community is to bond the country boy and the country girl to the soil, is 
unacceptable. The fact that a child is born on the farm is not at all an indica- 
tion that he can in largest measure realize his birthright and serve his fellows by 
remaining on the farm. Any system of education designed to limit resources 
of self-discovery is restrictive both of the rights of the child and of the progress of 
society. On the contrary, it is a prime obligation of democratic society to 
provide for prospective citizens who happen to be born in the country every 
possible avenue of self-discovery that may lead to the central life activity of the 
normal citizen—his vocation. 
So far as the basis of experience which society can provide for intelligent 
choice of life pursuits on the part of prospective citizens is concerned, the follow- 
ing postulates are offered: 
1. It must result in the understanding both of essential requirements and of 
significant opportunities in (a) the vocation itself, (b) the life implied in pursuit 
of the vocation, (c) the preparation implied in acceptance of the vocation. 
2. It must take one, two, or all of the following forms, whether under formal 
or informal auspices: (a) Participation, (b) observation, (c) vicarious informa- 
Homceta t 
As to the agency that shall undertake the teaching of country boys and country 
girls what is necessary and possible to intelligent choice of vocation, the common 
opinion of educators is accepted. No rehearsal of reasons is here needed. Th 
agency is the public school in that level given to diversified teaching for the nk 
of “finding’’—the junior high school level. Assuming that an organizatio) 
involving all of the essential functions of the junior high school will ultimately 
be made workable in the rural districts, I venture to suggest a plan for the develop: 
ment of the prevocational function. The plan.centers in the provision of one or 
two teachers for each rural community, employed for the full year rather tha: 
for the school year, equipped with the means of transporting small groups of

  AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION 189 
pupils from place to place, and devoting their whole time, working out from the 
school, to teaching pupils the essentials of intelligent choice of vocation. 
Such teachers must, of ‘course, possess a greater range of qualifications than is 
now required of the teacher in either the junior or the senior high school. Probably 
few persons are now qualified for such a task. But qualified persons can be pre- 
pared if the demand be made. The educational service to be rendered is second 
in significance only to that of the elementary school. The demand will come. 
Qualified teachers will be prepared to serve and will be given the chance to serve, 
whether under such a plan as suggested or under another and better. Until that 
is done “equality of opportunity,” to which rural boys and girls are entitled the 
country over, will remain as it is—equal lack of opportunity. 
E. E. Windes,’ in discussing the problem of agriculture for the 
seventh and eighth grades in the rural schools of Currituck County, 
N. C., makes the general statement and the formulation of objectives 
that follow: 
The life problems of the modern farmer are extremely diversified. He deals 
directly with the primary and derived energy of nature, with the tools which 
transform this primary and derived energy into productive work, with a variety 
of mineral elements and their compounds, with plant life throughout the plant 
series, with animal life throughout the animal series, with man as an individual, 
as organized groups of workers, as a consuming market, and as a controlling 
whole. 
His greatest surety for success lies in training in methods of attack and mate- 
rials available for the solution of problems in all these fields. A partial success 
may attend his mastery of the means of solving problems of one group of rela- 
tionships, but failure to take into account problems of another group may not 
only rob him of returns for his effort in one direction but may actually lead to 
his undoing. He may become very proficient in the use of labor-saving tools 
and materially reduce the labor cost of producing crops, only to face economic 
ruin because of the appearance of a crop pest with which he can not deal, or 
because his increased production has overstocked the market so that consumers 
will not pay even the lowered cost of producing the article. Again, he may 
become very efficient as a producer of a given commodity, only to find that as he 
increases his output and lowers his costs of production other organized groups 
between him and the consuming public absorb the profits through higher wages, 
higher transportation rates, higher returns for capital, or by the appearance of 
additional middle groups through which the commodity must pass. 
The course of study here outlined is frankly prevocational. Its major objec- 
tives are: 
1. To introduce problems involving the essential life relations of farmers as 
dealing with nature, with the world of workers, with the general public, and as 
producers of marketable commodities, to the end that the pupil may get such a 
survey of farming as an occupation and a mode of living that he may judge fairly 
whether he desires to enter upon the occupation, and in case of entrance upon 
farming as an occupation to furnish a basis for an understanding of these rela- 
tionships. i 
2. To introduce a comparative study of occupations to the end that an intelli- 
gent choice of an occupation and of the curriculum best fitting for that occupation 
be made. ‘ i 
8. To provide through construction and production projects such a sampling 
of jobs met with in farming of various types that the pupil may judge his fitness

for the types of tasks necessarily met with in farming of specific types. Since 
farming offers such diversity of tasks and requisite skills, these samplings are 
further valuable as indicating ability in nonagricultural occupations of a consid- 
erable variety: } 
4, To provide training in the method of attack in solving problems and knowl- 
edge of sources of material for the study and solution of problems in agriculture. 
5. To motivate other subjects of the agricultural and general curricula through 
showing their relation to success in agriculture. 
6. To furnish adequate guidance in the selection of vocational projects of the 
high school proper. 
7. To acquaint the pupil with the various agencies of the county, State, and 
Nation dealing with agriculture, the kind of service these agencies render, and 
to develop the habit of using these agencies. 
BOYS’ AND GIRLS’ CLUB WORK 
Any consideration of the teaching of agriculture in the elementary 
school in which the boys’ and girls’ club work was ignored would be 
incomplete. This work has not generally been closely articulated 
with the work of the elementary school, but for the most part the 
members of the clubs are pupils in the elementary schools. Data 
are not available for the entire country to show the extent to which 
club members are pupils in the elementary schools, but an intensive 
study recently made for New York State furnishes the following 
data:*

It is true that in New York State a distinct effort has been made 
to keep the junior extension—boys’ and girls’ club work—on an edu- 
cational basis and wherever practicable closely identified with the 
educational system. This program may be a selective factor result- 
ing in the enrollment of somewhat younger workers than would 
otherwise be obtained. However, these figures correspond fairly 
closely with similar data available from other sources, and a distinct

drive has been made in New York to procure the enrollment of older 
boys and girls, without marked influence on the ages of those enroll- 
ing. As a group the mémbers of boys’ and girls’ clubs are largely 
in the elementary school. 
The latest available report of the office of cooperative extension 
work ? contains the following data on the size of organization deal- 
ing with boys’ and girls’ club work:

  1922 1928 
State leaders - 45 42

Rowntyteaderss oes = ae a OR ee ae 205 153 
The same source is authority for the statement that in 1923 there 
were 28,200 clubs, with a membership of 600,957 boys and girls. In 
addition to the work done by the boys’ and girls’ club leaders, the 
3,500 agents for county agricultural and home demonstration work 
contribute more or less to the club work. 
As this organization deals largely with the teaching of agriculture 
and home economics to children of the elementary-school period, it 
is of interest to note its objectives for these activities. The quota- 
tions which follow are taken from the most recent reports of the 
chief of the office of cooperative extension work.® 
For the past three or four years the effort has been made to make the club 
activities conform entirely to the farm and farm-home needs of the various 
communities and counties. The past year’s work has brought this objective 
within reach as a complete attainment. * * * Greater volume, or number of 
demonstrators per community, has been encouraged in order to more quickly 
establish new practices. As a result, boys’ and girls’ club work more successfully 
and more widely demonstrates better practices than heretofore. 
That most improved phases of farm and home practices can be demonstrated 
by boys and girls is quite generally recognized. In fact, extension workers are 
realizing that many farm and home practices can be best demonstrated through 
boys and girls, and the latter will no doubt play an increasingly important part 
in the prosecution of the extension program in the future. 
A large number of counties undertook for the first time during the past year 
to make provisions for boys’ and girls’ club work in the community and county 
extension programs of work as a means of dealing with particular programs. 
These community programs of work were built on the basis of problems found 
through intensive study, careful observation, and use of all available statistics. 
These statements point clearly to the predominance of the improve- 
ment of farming as the objective.

The enrollment in vocational agriculture for the various types of 
work is shown by the following figures from the 1924 report of the 
Federal Board for Vocational Education:

The enrollment in day schools is primarily in high-school depart- 
ments of agriculture. From the data given it is apparent that there 
has been a tendency in the past few years to expand the types of 
work offered so as to reach other groups of pupils. 
Not all the farm boys who have dropped out of school will be inter- 
ested in preparing for farming. Thousands of them will, however, 
and they will have little or no opportunity to make a study of the 
scientific bases of their chosen vocation, before they become adults, 
unless provisions are made for them in connection with the State 
programs for vocational education in agriculture. In the past the 
instruction in vocational agriculture has been confined too exclusively 
to the high schools. During the past two years the extension of the 
work beyond the high-school group has relatively gone too largely to 
the adult farmers. To reach these youths who are just entering upon 
farming careers is difficult, much more difficult than to attempt to 
work with adult farmers. That it is not impossible is clearly shown 
by the results in several States where they are being reached in large 
numbers.     
AGRICULTURE IN COLLEGIATE INSTITUTIONS 
In many of the colleges of agriculture there has been a decline in 
recent years in the enrollment in agriculture. In the land-grant 
colleges, statistics show the following enrollments in agriculture for the 
white institutions: 
1910-11... 
1911-12. 
1912-1: 
1913-14__.

1915-1

1917-18... 1918-19_      
       This change has aroused the interest of the teaching and adminis- 
trative staffs of the agricultural colleges. Discussions of the cause 
are necessarily more or less theoretical, but it seems probable that an 
 
-P-A-G-E-198
  194 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1922-1924 
important factor is the reaction that followed the marked expansion 
in enrollment 10 to 15 years ago. At that time large numbers of 
students entered colleges of agriculture with erroneous ideas of what 
these colleges could do for them. The possibilities of the college of 
agriculture as now organized and administered are becoming better 
understood. The problem remains whether radical changes in the 
curricula might be made to advantage. It is suggested that an ex- 
haustive study of collegiate instruction in agriculture should be made 
by a sympathetic but unbiased commission, in order to secure reliable 
data regarding the needs for modifications in the work or these insti- 
tutions. The land-grant colleges have had their work in agriculture 
well under way for about a generation. It seems, therefore, that 
such a study might furnish data for the formulation of more satis- 
factory objectives than the present ones. 
Evidences of interest in a more scientific determination of objec- 
tives in this field appear in the following resolution that was adopted 
by the subsection on resident teaching in agriculture at the 1923 
meeting of the Association of Land-Grant Colleges: 
1. Resolved, That this association adopt the proposals put forward in the paper 
by Dean Vivian for a comprehensive study of the objectives in college instruction 
in agriculture, and an analysis of the determined objectives in terms of their 
requirements and skills, as a basis for sound curriculum building in collegiate 
agricultural instruction. 
Resolved further, That the association authorize its president to appoint a com- 
mittee, at least one of whose members is experienced in the technique of job analy- 
sis, which shall present to the association at its next annual meeting a workable 
plan for such a study and providing for the participation of the several colleges 
in its prosecution. 
2. Resolved, That if the executive body concur, the executive committee be 
directed to investigate the possibility of interesting one or more institutions in the 
matter of specialized research on methods of college instruction, with power to 
invite such institutions to designate one or more members of their staff to under- 
take such research as a basis for college instruction in this field. 
Further objective evidences of interest in the improvement of 
collegiate instruction in agriculture are the following: 
1. The considerable portion of the program of the agricultural 
section of the Association of Land-Grant Colleges that in the past

very satisfactory in two such courses offered in the New York State 
College of Agriculture. These courses are as follows: 
22. Psychology for Students of Education. First term. Credit, four hours.

23. Problems of Agricultural College Teaching. Second term. Prerequisite course 
22. Lectures, T. Th., 11-12.30. 
For the academic year 1925-26 a seminar meeting once a week 
will be available to members of the staff who have had the two courses 
described. 
At the convention of the Association of Land-Grant Colleges in 
1924, a special committee on objectives in college instruction in 
agriculture recommended that: : 
1. A permanent central committee of this association charged with the study 
of the desirable reorganization of the curricula of the agricultural colleges be 
appointed. The committee should consist of three deans of colleges of agri- 
culture, two men acquainted with the technique of job analysis and curriculum 
construction, a representative of the Federal Board for Vocational Education, 
and a representative of the Federal Department of Agriculture. 
2. The committee should meet for at least two three-day sessions during the 
year. * * * 
8. The field of agricultural education should be expolored and a study made 
of the major aims and objectives of collegiate training in agriculture. * * * 
In the confident opinion that such a study through a period of years will prove 
one of the most valuable pieces of work every undertaken by this association, 
your special committee urges the adoption of the reccommendations herein 
contained.

INTRODUCTION 
Home economics education during the past biennium has made 
notable progress in a number of directions. These directions include, 
among others, a clarification of the contributions of home economics 
to general education, to health education, to child care and welfare, 
and a reorganization of the curriculum, based on scientific evidence. 
This latter problem, together with a scientific selection of home 
economic objectives to be achieved, has been for some time para- 
mount in the minds of many home economics leaders. 
These interests have called for an almost complete restatement of 
objectives and goals and a revision of subject matter. This has 
occupied leaders of home economics in a number of States and in 
many cities. Notable among the latter is Denver, Colo., where the 
revision of the home economics curriculum was influenced by 
Briggs’s philosophy of education, namely, “'To teach pupils to do 
better the desirable activities that they will perform anyway; to 
reveal higher types of activities and to make them both desired and, 
to an extent, possible,” and, secondly, that “ the curriculum is a series 
of experiences so selected, guided, and coordinated that what is 
learned in one experience contributes to the elevation and enrich- 
ment of any succeeding series of experiences.” 
With this outlook upon education, Denver observed in its curric- 
ulum-making procedure the three following steps, namely, the selec- 
tion of present home activities of the schoolgirl; an enrichment of 
these experiences through subject-matter content, and the elevation 
and direction of the girl’s present home activities and experiences to 
higher levels, thereby safeguarding her preparation for home activ- 
ities occurring in her life at some future time. 
Besides the problems discussed, time allotment, efficient types of 
equipment, and opportunities for research in various phases of home 
197  
-P-A-G-E-202
  198 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1922-1924 
economics education have, during the biennium, been duly 
recognized. 
CONTRIBUTIONS OF HOME ECONOMICS TO GENERAL EDUCATION 
A questionnaire was addressed to leading educators of the United 
States by the Bureau of Education asking their opinion as to the 
contribution that home economics makes to general education in the 
elementary and secondary schools and in institutions of higher educa- 
tion. This questionnaire was sent to the presidents, deans of educa- 
tion, deans of women, and heads of home economics departments of 
State and private universities and colleges, of normal schools, and 
of State colleges for teachers, to superintendents of schools and 
supervisors of home economics of cities with a population of 2,500 
or more, and to State supervisors of home economics. 
Replies to this questionnaire were received from 70 presidents of 
universities and colleges, 80 presidents of normal schools, 54 deans 
and professors of education, 37 deans of women, 170 school super- 
intendents, 71 directors of home economics departments of colleges 
and universities, 33 State and 45 city supervisors of home economics. 
Eighty per cent of the presidents of State and private universities, 
68 per cent of the deans and professors of education, 58 per cent of 
the deans of women in the leading universities and colleges, and 
100 per cent of the city superintendents of schools, heads of depart- 
ments, and supervisors of home economics state that “worthy home 
membership ” is the conspicuous contribution of home economics to 
general education. They believe that this cardinal principle of 
education is realized through the home economics offerings of educa- 
tive experiences and opportunities which lead to the development 
of the following abilities: 
1. To live within the laws of health. 
2. To appreciate home and family relationship and the place of the home 
in the community. 
8. To’contribute to the highest welfare of the child. 
4. To budget income and to weigh values regarding time, energy, and 
resources. 
5. To perform daily household processes; to attack and solve home 
problems. 
6. To appreciate the labor involved in the production of all household 
commodities. 
7. To develop a capacity for a higher enjoyment of life. 
RELATION OF HOME ECONOMICS TO HEALTH 
Home economics makes a positive contribution to health through 
its teachings of adequate nutrition, clothing and personal hygiene, 
sanitary housing and living. It is now conceded that of all the 
   
-P-A-G-E-203
  PROGRESS IN HOME ECONOMICS EDUCATION 199 
other health factors no one is greater than a proper food supply 
intelligently used. This principle is now exercised in many city 
schools. For example, in Columbus, Ohio, the nutrition expert of 
the home economics staff has outlined for grades one to six the 
following health rules: 
1. Eat one leafy vegetable and some fruit every day. 
2. Drink a pint of milk every day and at least four glasses of 
water. 
3. Eat three wholesome meals a day. 
4. Chew thoroughly and eat slowly. 
5. Meals for children should include milk, vegetables, fruits, grain 
products, meat or its equivalent, such as fish, eggs, peas, beans, 
nuts, cheese. 3 
6. Take a bath at least twice a week and keep your clothes clean 
and neat. 
7. Dress in clean comfortable clothing to suit the weather. This 
health rhyme is the clothing slogan: 
“Wool or cotton, fur or leather, 
Proper clothing to suit the weather, 
Loose it is from neck to feet, 
And always tidy, clean, and neat:” 
8. Sleep at least 10 hours a day, with windows open. 
The home economics classes of the Clemens Vonnegut School, of 
Indianapolis, Ind., have developed, a folder for the children of their 
school and have named it “ Good Health for Boys and Girls.” This 
folder asks the following questions: 
1. How much and what food does a growing child need each day? 
2. Need a child who is now underweight remain underweight? 
3. What is a food? 
4, What is a calorie? 
5. What quantities of food are necessary to yield 100 calories? 
In a like manner these home economics classes developed the 
following personal hygiene and clothing suggestions for girls: 
1. Clean the finger nails daily. Do not bite them. 
2. Brush teeth thoroughly twice a day. Do not pick them with 
needles and pins. 
3. Bathe at least once a week in winter and twice a week in 
summer. Use good toilet articles. 
4. Wear simple hygienic undergarments and night clothes. 
5. Wear the hair in a simple, girlish style. Brush and comb it 
every night before retiring. Shampoo it every three weeks. 
6. Wear substantial stockings suitable for a schoolgirl. 
7. Wear shoes according to season. They should be neat and 
comfortable. Polish often.
-P-A-G-E-204
  200 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1922-1924 
8. Rubbers should be worn in rainy weather. Never wear them in 
the house. Raincoats are a great protection. 
9. Wear simple dresses suitable for the occasion and season. Use 
buttons or fasteners; no pins. 
10. Cloaks should be medium or dark in color, of good wool mate- 
rial, styles suitable for several winters. 
11. Hats should be simple, serviceable, and appropriate to season 
and occasion. 
12. Knitted and crocheted sweaters and hats are good for girls. 
A joint committee of the National Education Association and the 
American Medical Association, cooperating with a technical commit- 
tee of 27 in outlining a health-education program for public schools 
and teacher-training institutions, gave a prominent place to nutrition 
and to the teaching of foods. Under the caption “ School Luncheons 
as an Educational Feature,” this joint committee declared that “The 
school luncheon can be made a means of providing for the child edu- 
cational material in a way suited to his needs. In fact, the whole of 
the daily school program can be planned around a meal without un- 
due emphasis upon the food itself.” 
The joint committee organized a health course beginning with the 
kindergarten and extending through the normal school that centered 
around food. 
The State Department of Education of Oklahoma outlined a nutri- 
tion and health program for the elementary school, placing emphasis 
on the right kind of food for growing boys and girls. 
In recent years pronounced progress has been made in State and 
city home economics courses as to the interdependence of foods, 
clothing, hygienic living, and health. Illustrations of this fact can 
be taken from practically all home-economics courses. Space limita- 
tion confines the illustrations to a small number. 
Portland, Oreg.—The major home-economics aims for the seventh 
and eighth grades are— 
1. To know and appreciate the value of the general health rules. 
2. To know types of foods and their functions in the body and 
what are good for babies and children; how to plan attractive and 
well-balanced meals; how to care for food properly; how to set the 
table and serve a meal correctly; correct standards of foods, both 
cooked and uncooked ; and to have some knowledge of food industries 
and a general idea of the cost of food. 
3. Good habits in housekeeping duties, as to personal cleanliness: 
and the importance of sanitary handling of foods. 
New Mexico.—In the State course of study for the common schools, 
for the fifth grade in home economics, are these problems: 
How can I keep my home clean and in order? What care should 
I give my clothing? Am I getting the food I need for my school
-P-A-G-E-205
  PROGRESS IN HOME ECONOMICS EDUCATION 201 
lunch? What can we do to keep the baby well? What does the 
baby need to make him grow? How can I keep well and happy? 
In the sixth grade, under the topic “‘The Child: Its Health and 
the Health of the Family,” are studied these problems: 
What must be done to keep the baby well? What clothes are best 
for the baby? What shall we do to make the baby grow? How 
can the family keep well and happy? What should be done in case 
of illness in the home? 
In the seventh grade, under “Child Care and Health of the 
Family,” are stressed not only the care of the baby but also of the 
older child, as to the kind of food, clothing, home care, and environ- 
ment essential to his well-being, how to prevent colds, information 
essential to prevention and spread of disease, and training in first 
aid. 
Oklahoma.—tThe State department of education outlines for the 
ninth-grade girl in home economics such topics as “Foods and 
Health,” under which are stressed the problems: How we help our- 
selves grow, how much do we weigh, why we should eat vegetables, 
why we should eat regular meals, what factors affect personal ap- 
pearance, and other problems affecting health. 
Home nursing and child. care and elementary dietetics, among 
other courses, may be elected in the senior high school. Reasons 
given in the State home economics course of study for planning the 
first course are that girls may have an opportunity to learn 
causes and means of transmission of communicable diseases, simple 
and usable methods of prevention of them; how to secure and main- 
tain physical and mental health from infancy through life; how 
to be intelligent and helpful in the sick room; and the second course 
is to teach girls, through diet, right food habits and health. 
Indiana.—tThe State course of study in home economics for sec- 
ondary schools states that the basis of the food section is the health 
of the girl in the adolescent period. The food discussion begins 
with the questions: Why should we eat the right food? What is 
the relation of diet to attractive appearance, success in athletics, 
and a good disposition? 
Detroit, Mich—¥or the sixth grade the work in household arts 
is divided into two main divisions. They are (a) health, and (6) 
cooking. The aim of the course is, “'To emphasize attractiveness 
of good health and its advantages, not to make the child health- 
conscious, but scientifically and inspirationally to teach health as a 
natural result of right living.” 
The minor divisions under health are— 
1. Personal hygiene. 
2. Fresh air and exercise. 
3. Rest—amount of sleep necessary. 
4. Diet—the foods necessary to promote good health,
-P-A-G-E-206
  202 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1922-1924 
New York City——The high-school girl in the clothing course is 
taught the interdependence of health and clothing. In this con- 
nection the clothing essentials to health outlined are, (@) warmth; 
(6) ventilation as to weight, porousness, absorption, and conductiv- 
ity; (¢) cleanliness; and (d@) freedom. 
Cleveland, Ohio—A garment-making project for sixth-grade girls, 
the making of' doll’s clothes, is adapted to the needs and purposes 
of the sixth-grade classes. Hence no doll is permitted to wear 
French heels or pointed toes, transparent stockings, unpolished or 
unlaced shoes. The hygiene, suitability, economy, and care of each 
garment are discussed. Sixth-grade girls are not considered too 
young to learn that washable clothes should be washed and ironed 
frequently, other clothes should be aired and dry-cleaned often. 
Des Moines, Iowa.—The clothing course for the seventh-grade girl 
includes the topics: 
1. Standards for hygienic dress (simplicity, appropriateness, 
cleanliness, inherent properties of fibers). 
2. Care of clothing in daily use—airing, folding, laundering, 
brushing, pressing, and repairing. 
8. Formation of healthful habits of work. 
Philadelphia, Pa—In the grades, beginning with 5B, through 
the elementary clothing courses, the following health principles are 
taught: 
5B. Proper sleeping conditions. 
Importance of sleep. 
Fresh air an essential. 
Cleanliness of person, garments, and bed. 
Number of hours of sleep. 
Posture in sleeping. 
6A. Amount and kind of clothing desirable,

HOME ECONOMICS PROVIDES TRAINING IN CHILD CARE AND WELFARE 
I. In Teacher-Training Institutions. 
Training of collegiate character in child care and welfare for the 
pre-school child began in this country in the Merrill Palmer School 
of Homemaking, established in Detroit, Mich., in 1920. 
This institution during the biennium has cooperated with a num- 
ber of colleges and universities in providing for the seniors and 
graduate students of home economics laboratory facilities and 
courses in the problems of the child. 
During the summer of 1924, 27 of the leading universities of 
America offered some courses in “The Health of the Child” de- 
signed for doctors and nurses, while, at the same time, 26 institu- 
tions—colleges and normal schools—were aiming through similar 
courses to give specific training in the problems of the child to the 
teachers of this country. 
In 1924 the Chicago University Cooperative Nursery opened its 
three-story home and placed the nursery in charge of a graduate of 
home economics. 
The practice houses of the college and university departments of 
home economics give opportunities to their students for the observa- 
tion and care of children. This experiment has proved’ so success- 
ful that many of the practice houses are maintaining at least one 
child of pre-school age, and where this arrangement is impossible 
home-economics seniors have assigned to them for care and observa- 
tion young children either in the nutrition clinics of the department 
of home economics or in the community. 
 
-P-A-G-E-208
  204 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1922-1924 
The following topics on child care and training illustrate the em- 
phasis placed by the college department of home economics on this 
subject. The topics are: 
I. The child in relation to his environment. 
II. The rights of the child. 
III. Maternity problems. 
IV. Care of the newborn infant. Positive health for the pre- 
school child. Height-weight charts. Clothing in relation 
to health. 
V. Recognition of common dangers to health. 
VI. Mental and physical growth. : 
Recently the Laura Spelman Rockefeller Memorial contributed 
$250,000 to maintain an institute of child welfare at the University 
of Minnesota. This institute by means of specialists in the various 
departments at the university, such as psychology, education, pedi- 
atrics, physiology, home economics, and sociology, will conduct 
studies relative to the child. It will also serve as a training center 
for nursery-school teachers and for leaders in parent education, 
and assist in an extension program concerning the education of 
parenthood. 
The State Agricultural and Mechanical Arts College of Oklahoma 
organized a nursery for pre-school children in connection with its 
teacher-training courses, and the State course of study for home 
economics outlines a unit in “child care,” for both the elementary 
and high school. 
Ll. In Elementary and Secondary Schools. 
In December of 1924 the Highland Park (Mich.) High School 
opened in connection with its home economics department a nursery 
school and enrolled 12 children ranging from 21% to 4% years of 
age. This forward-looking move in education is distinctive, for no 
other public high school in the United States has attempted to pro- 
vide a laboratory in the form of a nursery for a course in child care 
designed for seniors in home economics, 
Prerequisites for the child-care courses are nutrition and clothing 
for children. The following tentative outline for discussion periods 
in child care is given: 
1. General instruction, and discussion of aims of nursery schools. 
2. Educational importance of daily routine. 
. Food and principles of nutrition. 
. Play equipment, books, songs, plays, ete. 
. Physical care, food, clothing, medical attention. 
Behavior problems. 
. Conflict of wills. 
. Punishments. 
. Habit formation. CHANDA

The day nurseries of Los Angeles, Calif., were taken over for 
maintenance by the board of education of that city in 1917 and 
made an integral part of the school system. There are now 16 of 
these day nurseries which furnish for the elementary-school girl a 
laboratory for the training in her care of the pre-school child. 
In Oakland, Calif., there is a similar organization. 
Schenectady, N. Y., has an intermediate school with an enter- 
prising home economics teacher who found that 50 per cent of the 
girls in this intermediate school “tended baby” when “out of 
school.” Hence she offered to the seventh-grade girls eight 90- 
minute lessons, including: 
1, Information necessary to make the baby grow. 
2. Visit to health clinic. 
8 and 4. Children’s garments young girls can make and how to decorate 
them. 
5. Ways and reasons for fastening baby’s clothes. 
6. Selection of materials for baby’s clothes. 
7. Baby’s diet. 
8. Planning and preparation of meals for an older sister and brother. 
REPORT OF CHILD CARE AND WELFARE MADE BY THE RESPECTIVE STATE SUPERVISORS 
OF HOME ECONOMICS 
The status of child care and welfare is reported by State super- 
visors of home economics of the following States: 
Pennsylvania.—Kighty high schools have a child-care course in 
vocational home economics, with a baby in two of the three teacher- 
training practice houses. 
Delaware.—Chiid care is not taught as a separate course, but is 
included in every food and clothing course in the high school. 
Zowa.—Rural children in 35 counties have been reached with 
nutrition projects. 
Montana— In. some high schools there are short units in child 
care. The State college offers a three-credit course with children 
under observation. 
Kentuchy.—A. few schools offer a unit in child care and infant 
sewing. 
Virginia—Three children of the Crippled Children’s Hospital 
were adopted by the John Marshall High School classes in home 
economics. Food, toys, and clothing were provided for them. An- 
other school adopted two first-grade children. 
Alabama—aAll the high schools give one unit in child care. A 
number of elementary schools carry on practical projects with chil- 
dren. 
New Hampshire.—Child care-given in the Nashua public schools 
in cooperation with the visiting nurse. 
27301°—27-_14    
-P-A-G-E-210

Idaho.—Studied as a special unit in every class.. Layettes and 
clothing for younger children made in many schools, special studies 
of diets, physical care of the baby, training of children. 
North Dakota—Child care is a part of the second-year home eco- 
nomics course in the high schools of the State and a two-point college 
course in the North Dakota Agricultural College for senior women. 
It is combined in the normals, State teachers’ college, and university 
with the work in home nursing. 
Louisiana—Advanced courses of the high schools include the 
work. 
Indiana—High schools emphasize the work. Milk is served to 
school children; health records are kept of children, often of the 
younger children at home; doctors and nurses in a home nursing 
course offer lectures on this point. 
Utah—A mother craft course for high schools includes diet and 
clothing for children. 
Nebraska—Child care is taught in two-thirds of the 60 vocational 
schools. 
Kansas.—All vocational schools give child care including observa- 
tion of young children and some personal care. 
New York.—For six weeks 130 high schools give 90 minutes daily. 
This training is part of the four-year home-making course. 
New Mewxico—ts included under health of the family. 
Vermont.—During the Christmas season, through cooperation of 
the Vermont Children’s Aid Society, home economics classes adopted 
children dependent on the State. 
The home economics girls made clothes, planned the yearly needs 
of their particular child, and sent off a box to meet these needs. 
Special child-care units are introduced in the schools at this time. 
Home nursing is offered in many schools. 
West Virginia.—Fifteen high schools reimbursed by Smith- 
Hughes funds give a unit in child care. 
Rhode Island—Part of the Rhode Island State College course. 
A play school is maintained one afternoon each week for the pre- 
school child. 
Michigan —Kighteen of the oustanding home economics seniors at 
the Michigan State College are admitted to the Merrill Palmer 
School each year. New and revised courses at: all the colleges and 
normal schools are giving practical work. 
Oregon.—The Oregon Agricultural College has an organized 
course in child care which is open to all students on the campus. 
Mississippi—cChild-care units are offered in second year of high 
school, and many of the home projects are selected in this field. 
North Carolina—Some in connection with the home economics 
department of the Womans College at Greensboro. 
   
-P-A-G-E-211

NOTABLE IMPROVEMENT IN HOME ECONOMICS EQUIPMENT 
Among the most noteworthy advances in home economics equip- 
ment is the general sentiment against housing such departments in 
the basement. This sentiment has gathered in such proportions that 
home economics departments have been forced to the surface where 
good light and air are possible. The old-fashioned hollow square is

everywhere being displaced either by the “ unit desk arrangement ” 
or unit kitchens. Housekeeping suites are generally used. One of the 
best examples of this type of equipment is found in New York City. 
However, one of the most improved methods for making home 
economics function in the lives of the girls is the home economics 
cottage. These cottages have increased in number from 1 in 1907 
to more than 200 in 1925. According to Better Homes in America, 
64 per cent of this number “ were acquired between the years 1920 
and 1925.” One high school in the past biennium acquired a place 
for its nursery school. 
GRADES RECEIVING FOOD AND CLOTHING INSTRUCTION 
The Bureau of Education sent a questionnaire to 116 leading cities 
of the Untied States, asking as to the instruction given in food and 
clothing studies. Replies were received from 97 of these cities. The 
grades in which foods and clothing are taught, either as required or 
elective, or both, are shown in the following report:

Among the States reporting the use of educational tests in home 
economics are New Mexico, California, Utah, Idaho, South Dakota, 
Oklahoma, Minnesota, Indiana, North Carolina, Louisiana, Vermont, 
and Pennsylvania. 
During the biennium the following home economics educational

HOME ECONOMICS IN BUSINESS 
Home economics in business is a new venture, but from all reports 
it is proving a most successful one, for the trained home economics} 
woman is making known to the commercial world the needs of the 
20,000,000 home makers. She stands as the coordinator between the| 
home and industry. Her technical and scientific information is| 
appreciated and demanded more and more from food producers| 
and manufacturers of food, household equipment and furnishings, 
textiles and clothing, and from the industries engaged in banking, 
milling, dairying, and baking. Home economics workers are now 
found in all such industries and in a number of others. 
Nutrition service for the employees is now made available through| 
the foresight of many of the larger industrial concerns. The em- 
ployees’ health is now recognized as an asset. A number of home- 
economics women of national reputation have charge of the nutri-+ 
tion service in industrial concerns. Many department stores main- 
tain in their clothing sections trained home-economics lecturers on| 
dress, color, and design for the benefit of their patrons, for it i 
realized that the clothing teacher is responsible for increasing intelli- 
gence in this direction. 
Journalism in home economics is practically an unexplored field. 
yet a number of colleges and universities, realizing its importance, 
are advising the election of courses in the psychology of advertising, 
salesmanship, and others.   
 
-P-A-G-E-215
  PROGRESS IN HOME ECONOMICS EDUCATION 211 
Home-economics women have opened offices as consultants on the 
merchandising of home utilities, and, lastly, home economics has in- 
vaded the associated advertising clubs of the world in order that the 
truth concerning utilities for the home may be broadcast. 
HOME-ECONOMICS RESEARCH 
Home Economics Circular No. 18, published by the Bureau of 
Education June, 1924, gives the titles of completed research from 
home-economics departments in American colleges and universities 
from 1918 to 1923. 
AMERICAN HOME ECONOMICS IN FOREIGN FIELDS 
The American Home Economics Association in 1920 voted to 
raise $6,000 for the support of a professor of home economics for 
the Constantinople College for Women. This undertaking has 
proved so successful that two sisters, graduates of the college, have 
opened a school with most primitive equipment in Tirona, the capital 
of Albania, and called it Kyrias Collegiate. Here, in this humble 
beginning, the fundamental principles of home life are to be taught. 
In 1922 the United States Department of Agriculture loaned to 
France a worker to train county demonstration agents. The result 
was that two young French women were dispatched to this country 
to receive six months’ training, one at Ames, Iowa, and the other at 
the Georgia State College of Agriculture. Upon their return to 
France they were each made responsible for the organization of 
home demonstration work in counties near Paris. 
Both New Zealand and Korea claim American pioneers in home 
economics. 
Perhaps the most outstanding accomplishment during the bien- 
nium is the survey of Chinese home life, made by the dean of nome 
economics of the Oregon Agricultural College. Twelve hundred and 
fifty questionnaires were sent to Chinese homes in 16 different Chi- 
nese Provinces. This study was made preliminary to the introduc- 
tion of home economics into Yenching College of Peking. 
THE BETTER HOMES IN AMERICA MOVEMENT 
The Better Homes in America movement was established in 1922 
and reorganized on a national basis in December, 1923. It is an edu- 
cational movement supported by public gifts and operated for the 
public service. 
It is the aim of Better Homes in America to establish a local 
committee in every community in America. The chairmen of the 
local committees are appointed by the officers of the national head-
-P-A-G-E-216
  212 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1922-1924 
quarters of the movement, and the other members are selected to 
represent local civic associations, clubs, schools, parent-teacher asso- 
ciations, chambers of commerce, and other organizations interested in 
the improvement of the home. 
Departments of home economics in our public schools and col- 
leges have found it. decidedly worth while to cooperate in the local 
Better Homes campaign, for participation in Better Homes demon- 
strations makes it possible for the children of any school to familiar- 
ize themselves with standards of home art and household economics, 
with the principles of selection of furniture and equipment, with 
budgeting of expenses, and with the whole range of the science and 
art of home making in so far as these can be imparted to persons 
of their age and background. 
THE AMERICAN HOME ECONOMICS ASSOCIATION 
The American Home Economics Association has, through the 
efforts of its executive secretaries, secured the affiliation of all the 
States except two, thereby increasing the membership of the asso- 
ciation in the past two years from 2,717 to 5,995 and from 13 clubs 
to 42. 
All the States now have well-organized associations engaged in 
various activities such as outlining the State policies in home-eco- 
nomics education, formulating home-economics information tests, 
sponsoring nutrition programs, extending their influence to the 
home makers through the State federated clubs and parent-teacher 
associations, and specifying their ideals regarding home-economics | 
equipment in no uncertain terms. 
. Five national meetings have been held at the following places: 
Cleveland, Corvallis, Chicago, New Orleans, and Buffalo. 
SOME CONTRIBUTIONS MADE BY THE BUREAU OF EDUCATION TO THE 
PROGRESS OF HOME ECONOMICS EDUCATION 
The following include some contributions of the home economics 
section of the Bureau of Education to the progress of home 
economics education : 
The Chicago conference called-by the Commissioner of Education 
in July, 1923, in conjunction with the American Home Economics 
Association, directed attention to the necessity of better teaching 
methods in home economics and stimulated the formation of com-. 
mittees to study home economics in public schools. 
At the national home economics conference called by the Com- 
missioner of education to Washington, D. C., in April, 1924, the 
place of home economics in the health and citizenship training pro- 
gram was defined and stated. This conference was attended by 62

home economics supervisors of cities of 10,000 population or more, 
by 100 home economics teachers, and by 100 other interested persons 
representing many educative organizations. 
In June, 1924, at Buffalo, in connection with the American Home 
Economics Association, a study was presented to 80 city supervisors 
concerning the specific contributions made by home economics to 
wholesome living not made by any other school subject. 
The free supply of 10,000 copies of Home Economics Circular 
No. 18, “ Titles of Completed Research from Home Economics De- 
partments in American Colleges and Universities, 1918 to 1923,” was 
almost immediately exhausted. 
This circular did two outstanding things which had not been done 
before. First, it summarized for the colleges and universities the 
number as well as the subjects of home economics research accom- 
plished in the various colleges and universities in the United States; 
this information was not available prior to the publishing of Home 
Economics Circular No. 18; and, secondly, it stimulated research in 
home economics departments, which now has been given a material 
impetus by the passage of the Purnell Act. :

   ‘ONTENTS.—Increase in kindergarten enrollment—Better adjustment of kindergarten to 
the school—Progress in teacher-training—Kindergarten legislation—New kinder- 
garten literature—New lines of interest and effort. 
INTRODUCTION 
Marked progress has been made in the field of kindergarten edu- 
sation during the period from 1922 to 1924. This is shown in the 
ontinued increase in the enrollment in the kindergartens of the 
ountry; the better adjustment of the kindergarten to the school as 
whole; the improvement in the training of kindergarten teachers; 
nd the marked increase in the output of literature bearing on the 
subject. 
I. INCREASE IN KINDERGARTEN ENROLLMENT 
During the period from 1920-1922 the number of children enrolled 
the kindergartens of the United States showed an increase of 
5881. This brought the total enrollment to 555,830. Of this num- 
er 500,807 were enrolled in the public-school kindergartens and 
5,023 in those “other than public.” During the period from 1922- 
924 the number enrolled was 617,373, which was an increase of 61,- 
73. Of these, 562,897 were in the public schools and 54,456 in those 
f the other type. This was a falling off of 567 in the latter type 
f kindergartens. The greater increase during the period from 
922-1924 shows that the progress is cumulative. The estimated 
umber of children of 4 and 5 years in the United States for 1920 
was 4,765,661. The number enrolled in kindergartens was 11.7 per 
ent of that number. The estimated number for 1922 is 4,848,902. 
he increase in the enrollment for 1922-1924 has raised this to 12.7. 
In the degree of progress made in each biennium there are marked 
ifferences among the States. In 1919-20, for example, the gain of 
7,811 for both public and private kindergartens represented 32 
tates. The aggregate gain of 44,881 in 1920-1922 represented 39 
nd the District of Columbia. The gain of 61,373 in 1922-1924 
215
-P-A-G-E-220
    216 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1922-1924 
represents 39 States and the District of Columbia. The States hav- 
ing gains and losses differ to some extent from year to year. In 
1921-22, for example, the States having the greatest numerical 
gains in enrollment were, respectively: Missouri, 5,849;* New York, 
5,497; Ohio, 3,696; California, 3,656. In 1922-1924 the list differed 
in some measure as to the States and the increases in each. They 
are: California, 14,666; New York, 6,048; Michigan, 5,772; Ohio, 
5,732; Massachusetts, 3,862. A number of States report larger in- 
creases than usual. Pennsylvania has'a gain of over 3,000; Illinois, 
Towa, and Texas gains of over 2,000; and nine other States— 
Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Maryland, Minne- 
sota, Nebraska, and Wisconsin—gains of over 1,000 each. 
The States also fluctuate in the matter of losses in kindergarten 
enrollment. Those that reported losses in 1920-1922 were Colorado, 
Connecticut, Delaware, Idaho, Iowa, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, 
and Virginia. These losses in the Western States were not surpris- 
ing, in view of the agricultural depression in these States, The 
losses reported in 1922-1924 were in Indiana, Louisiana, Maine, 
_ Missouri,‘ Montana, North Carolina, Rhode Island, South Dakota; 
and Utah! It is worth noting that but one State, Masini; reports 
losses for both years. Since the kindergarten gained but a sligh 
foothold in the South for many years, the gains in the Souther: 
States are deserving of special comment. In 1920-1922 all thes 
States showed gains except Virginia. In 1924 Virginia also showe 
a gain, but Louisiana and North Carolina showed losses. Of thes 
States, the four having the highest gains were Florida, 1,430 
Georgia, 1,536; Maryland, 1,613; and Texas, 2,581. A study of th 
public-school kindergartens and those other than public woul 
doubtless show differences in the groupings and in the changes fro 
year to year, but the general character of the statistics would 
much the same. A comparison of the statistics for 1922-1924 wit 
those of 1920-1922 shows the following facts: That the number o 
school systems having kindergartens has increased from 1,203 t 
1,477; that the number of children enrolled has increased fro 
555,830 to 617,373; the number of kindergartens from 8,889 to 9,813 
and the number of teachers from 11,842 to 12,958. 
Il. BETTER ADJUSTMENT OF THE KINDERGARTEN TO THE 
SCHOOL 
The improvement in the adjustment of the kindergarten to th 
school is evident, but it has been a matter of progressive develop 
ment and can not easily be marked off into definite periods. In th 
  
The abnormal gain. reported for Missouri in 1920-1922 was clearly erroneous. It ij 
probable that no decrease occurred in that State in 1922-1924.—Zditor.

PROGRESS IN KINDERGARTEN EDUCATION 217 
early years of the movement the kindergarten was in the school, but 
not of it in the sense that its work had a definite relation to that 
of the grades to follow. There was a definite reason for this. The 
kindergarten illustrated a conception of education quite new at the 
time, that of the guidance of children’s interests and activities at 
the successive stages of their development. Its work was therefore 
in marked contrast to that of the primary grades, which was still 
conceived of as the mastery of the tools of learning. This made the 
unification of the work of the two difficult. 
THE NEW EDUCATIONAL AIMS THE BASIS FOR UNIFICATION 
The advance in psychology in recent years has made great changes 
in educational theory and practice, and the conception of education 
as the guidance of children’s interests and activities is being gradu- 
ally accepted as the true one, not for the kindergarten only but, in a 
greater or less degree, for the school as a whole. In consequence, 
many changes have been made in the organization and equipment of 
the elementary school in recent years. Not only have such subjects 
as play and games, music, and art in its several aspects, been added 
to the curriculum, but playgrounds, gymnasiums, workshops, and 
art studios have been provided in order that the work in these sub- 
jects might be as effective as possible. The methods, too, have been 
changed to allow opportunities for initiative and self-expression. 
Since the new lines of work were of the active type the value of the 
kindergarten, whose work is largely active, became more apparent. 
The better knowledge of the child’s development which these changes 
imply made corresponding changes in the kindergarten necessary, as 
it showed the play material devised by Froebel to lack the qualities 
that such material should possess. In consequence, there has been 
a change in the kindergarten materials; the small articles, such as 
sticks, rings, pricking and sewing cards, and fine weaving mats have 
been discarded or replaced by larger ones. Building blocks of 
several kinds are particularly favored to take their place. In this 
way the working material in the kindergarten and that in the grades 
have become more nearly alike. 
These changes in the kindergarten and primary grades are based 
upon the recognized fact that the years from 4 to 8 constitute one 
psychological period, and that, in consequence, the work of the kin- 
dergarten and the first and second grades should- be of the same 
general character. 
KINDERGARTEN-PRIMARY SUPERVISION A MEANS TO MORE EFFECTIVE 
UNIFICATION 
The unification of the kindergarten and the first grade has been in 
progress in individual schools and individual communities for seyv- 
eral years, but conditions have prevented its complete success. The
-P-A-G-E-222
  218 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1922-1924 
pros and cons of the kindergarten have, in fact, been the subject of 
many discussions, personal and professional, and these have doubtless 
contributed materially to an understanding of its value. If the work 
of a school is to be so organized that the work of the kindergarten is 
to serve as a real basis for that of the first grade, the work of both 
must be organized to that end. 
The appointment of a kindergarten-primary supervisor is one of 
the means to that end. Such supervisors are relatively new, but the 
number is rapidly increasing. A study of kindergarten supervision, 
made by the Bureau of Education in 1918, showed that there were at 
that time kindergarten supervisors in 131 cities, and the statement 
was made that “in some instances the supervisor of kindergartens is 
also the supervisor of primary grades.” This implied that the super- 
vision of both kindergarten and primary grades by the same person 
was unusual. At present 159 cities provide kindergarten supervision 
in some form. Ten of these have had such supervision for the past. 
year only. In 100 cities the supervision covers both the kindergarten 
and the primary grades. In 7 of these the supervisors were origi- 
nally kindergarten supervisors only, but became kindergarten- 
primary supervisors the past year. In 7 cities the supervision in- 
cludes the supervision of the kindergarten and all the elementary 
grades. In 5 the supervision is done by the assistant superintendent. 
The 12 largest cities vary in their type of supervision. In 4, Balti- 
more, Detroit, Los Angeles, and San Francisco, the supervisors are 
kindergarten-primary supervisors; in the others, Boston, Buffalo, 
Cleveland, New York City, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, and St. Louis, 
they are kindergarten supervisors only. Chicago has no kinder- 
garten supervision. 
The standards of preparation have evidently been raised in recent 
years. Of the 100 kindergarten-primary supervisors, 74 report hav- 
ing had both kindergarten and primary training. Of the entire 
group, 41 have college degrees; 16 of these hold masters’ degrees also, 
PROBLEMS THAT NEED SOLUTION 
The supervisors who recognize the unification of the kindergarten 
and primary grades as a means to the increased efficiency of the 
school have worked for the solution of definite problems. One of 
these has been the bringing of both the kindergarten and primary 
rooms up to the standards required by modern educational ideals. 
Tn this respect the kindergarten rooms have frequently had the ad- 
vantage over the primary rooms in the matter of play and work | 
space, and it has been the latter that have needed the greater atten- 
tion. In the new buildings now in construction the need of adequate 
play space and equipment for young children is recognized and
-P-A-G-E-223
  
PROGRESS IN KINDERGARTEN EDUCATION 219 
met. Many rooms in old buildings lack these conveniences, but many 
of such rooms have been improved or play space has been found 
elsewhere. The kindergarten rooms are usually provided with cup- 
boards and closets in which to keep the material, but with the adop- 
tion of the more active types of work the primary rooms need these 
also. One of the improvements made in these is to make the closet 
shelves low enough in both types of rooms so that the children them- 
selves can get and put away the material. 
The idea of continuity of progress from the kindergarten on has 
also brought about many changes in the furniture. In this respect, 
also, the greater changes are likely to be needed in the primary 
rooms, since the kindergarten has always had movable tables and 
chairs. The games, dramatizations, and construction work that 
now constitute a part of the early grade work make movable fur- 
niture essential in these grades also, and this has already replaced 
the stationary seats and desks in many places. - 
The progressive development of children’s ability to use material 
of different kinds implies a reorganization of the materials used in 
both kindergarten and primary rooms. Much of the traditional 
kindergarten material, such as the pricking and sewing cards, the fine 
weaving mats, etc., are not now approved because of the strain on chil- 
dren’s eyes and small muscles. These have been discarded, and other 
materials, such as small beads, sticks, and blocks, have been replaced 
by larger material of the same kind. Many new and larger types of 
building blocks have been devised, and in working out projects the 
smaller blocks, pegs, and beads can be used. With these changes the 
equipment and work of the kindergarten can be made to prepare 
children for the definite art work in the grades. Some differentia- 
tion, however, must be made in view of the development of the chil- 
dren’s interest and power to use material. Beads and peg boards, 
for example, have an interest for the youngest kindergarten children 
but practically none for the children in the primary grades. This 
reorganization of the play equipment has already been effected in 
many places and is in process in many others. In the changes sug- 
gested and made in the furniture and equipment of the primary 
rooms in particular much credit is due the National Council of 
Primary Education. 
The fact that these changes are well under way is shown in the 
replies to a questionnaire on certain phases of kindergarten super- 
vision recently sent out by the bureau for compilation later. The 
point of this questionnaire was to determine the degree of responsi- 
bility in such matters as the planning and equipment of new rooms, 
the organizing of the curriculum, and related items. Replies were 
received from 89 of the 159 supervisors. Of these, 15 reported 
having from 75 to 100 per cent responsibility in the planning of new  
-P-A-G-E-224
220 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1922-1924 
kindergarten rooms; a large number that they had some voice in 
the matter; and only 14 that they had none at all. In some of these 
replies the explanation was made that this meant that their sugges- 
tions were asked for by school principals, superintendents, and 
architects, and these were carried out if possible. The replies to the 
questions concerning the purchase of supplies, the organization of 
work of the kindergarten and primary in relation to each other, and 
the development of the curriculum were of the same tenor. Indi- 
rectly they indicated that strategic work is in process and that it is 
being done with a fine spirit of cooperation between teachers, super- 
visors, and school executives. 
PROBLEMS OF CLASSIFICATION AND PROMOTION 
One of the important problems of the kindergarten-primary super- 
visor is the prevention of failures on the part of the children and 
thereby the prevention of “repeaters” often found in such large 
numbers in the primary grades. One of the main causes of. these 
failures is that children have been classified and promoted on the 
basis of their chronological age instead of on the basis of their 
mental maturity as shown by psychological tests. ‘The use of these 
tests is one of the forward steps in the organization of the school. 
If the failures due to wrong classification are to be avoided it is 
evident that children’s mental ability should be tested early—at 
their entrance to the school. Tests for that purpose have been in- 
creasingly used with children in the grades, but with the exception 
of the Binet-Simon tests and the revisions of these, few of those 
in common use were adapted to children of kindergarten age. 
Within the past two years, however, several tests suitable for use 
with kindergarten children have been devised. Among these are 
the Detroit kindergarten tests and the Pintner-Cunningham tests, 
both of which are proving very serviceable. It has, therefore, be- 
come possible to classify and promote kindergarten children on a 
scientific basis. 
In order to determine to what extent, if any, such tests are used 
in determining the classification and promotion of kindergarten 
children, an inquiry covering this subject was sent out during the 
past year. To this inquiry 95 people replied. Of these, 51 reported 
that they were using tests in a greater or less degree. The tests 
used are mainly the Detroit, the Pintner-Cunningham, and the 
Binet-Simon, or Stanford revision of the Binet test. According 
to the reports, the tests are used mainly for two purposes: (1)To 
determine children’s readiness for promotion to the first grade and 
their classification into groups; and (2) to determine what to do 
with individual children of special types—those who are capable 
 
-P-A-G-E-225
  PROGRESS IN KINDERGARTEN EDUCATION 221 
of doing first-grade work but are below the entering age, those who 
have reached the promotion age but are below it from the stand- 
point of ability, and those whose promotion is doubtful for other 
reasons. 
Much would be gained if children were tested on entering kinder- 
garten, physically as well as mentally. An experiment in this di- 
rection was made in New York City in 1922 by the New York 
Chapter of the American Red Cross. The testing of more than 
1,000 children is described in a booklet entitled “The Examination of 
Pre-School Age Children.” This was issued by the health service 
of the organization named. 
The testing of kindergarten children is practically a development 
of the past two years. Fewer than one-third of the cities having 
kindergarten supervision replied, it is true, and in many cases the 
use of tests is still limited, but the fact that they are in successful 
use in so many cities will stimulate their use in others. As the use 
of tests for determining children’s ability in the primary grades is 
already established, their use in the kindergarten is needed in order 
that the children who attend it may be more fully prepared for 
successful work later on. 
UNIFICATION OF THE KINDERGARTEN AND PRIMARY CURRICULUM 
The complete adjustment of the kindergarten to the school is 
shown in the unified kindergarten-primary curriculum, which is the 
product of the past few years. This also has been a matter of pro- 
gressive development. In the early years of the movement the kin- 
dergarten teacher had her outline of work or “program” and the 
primary teacher her course of study. Both were little more than 
statements of things to be done or subjects to be taught during a 
given period. Both were equally formal. The change in educa- 
tional objectives during the past few years, with the broadening of 
the elementary curriculum and the changes in method which this 
entailed, has called a new type of curriculum into existence. With a 
clearer understanding of the new educational ideals and their impli- 
cations for the work of the early years the essential unity of the aims 
and methods of the kindergarten and primary grades became ap- 
parent, and the new courses of study gave evidence of this. In 1920 
the State of New Jersey published a “Manual for Kindergarten 
Teachers,” which was, in effect, a kindergarten-primary manual in 
its emphasis upon the unity of the two. In 1922 the Bureau of Edu- 
cation published a kindergarten-first-grade curriculum to indicate 
how the primary teacher should utilize the work of the kindergarten 
as shown in the kindergarten curriculum published by the bureau in 
27301°—27—_15.

1919. Since that time several cities have issued courses of study in 
which the kindergarten is recognized as the first stage in a complete 
school system. 
Ill. PROGRESS IN THE TRAINING OF KINDERGARTEN TEACHERS 
In the training of kindergarten teachers the progress has been 
especially marked during the years from 1922-1924. This is shown 
by the organization of kindergarten training departments in institu- 
tions that have not had them before; the movement for the length- 
ening of existing courses; the reorganization of the separate kinder- 
garten and primary courses into unified kindergarten-primary 
courses, and the organization of graduate courses for teachers in 
service. In the past two or three years kindergarten departments 
or courses have been organized in the City Normal School, Atlanta, 
Ga.; Cotner College, Bethany, Nebr.; Ashley Hall, Charleston, S. C.; 
the State Normal Schools of Danbury and New Haven, Conn.; and 
the Maryland State Normal School, Towson. In this latter case the 
State of Maryland took over the Baltimore City Teachers Training 
School, which included a kindergarten department. Emory Uni- 
versity, Atlanta, Ga., gave kindergarten courses in its summer ses- 
sion in 1924, and efforts looking to the creation of a kindergarten 
department as a part of its school of education are in progress. The 
total number of institutions that give kindergarten training courses 
is now 155. Of these, 79 are supported by States, 25 by cities, and 
the remaining 54 by private funds. In addition to these a few insti- 
tutions give a brief general course in kindergarten education for the 
purpose of giving all students a general idea of the aims and methods 
of the kindergarten. There are also 15 or 20 that have kindergartens 
as a part of the demonstration school and use them for observation 
work in the methods courses. 
LENGTHENING THE KINDERGARTEN TRAINING COURSES 
The movement for the lengthening of all teacher-training courses 
included the kindergarten courses also. This effort was led in large 
part by the State institutions, and in 1921 the legislatures of several 
States empowered the normal schools in these States to give courses 
of more than two years in length and to grant degrees to those com- 
pleting prescribed four-year courses. The States in this group hav- 
ing publicly supported kindergarten training schools or departments 
are California, Colorado, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, 
Nebraska, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, Ohio, Texas, and 
Virginia. These States include 40 institutions that give such train- 
ing, and in those therefore the more adequate courses may be given. 
Thus far, however, but two States have increased their graduation
-P-A-G-E-227
  
PROGRESS IN KINDERGARTEN EDUCATION 223 
requirements. All the courses in the California State teachers col- 
leges have been increased to two and one-half years, and all those in 
the State teacher-training institutions in New York have been in- 
creased to three. Many other institutions, both public and private, 
are offering additional courses or summer courses of advanced char- 
acter for which credit toward a degree is given. A few institutions 
are giving four-year courses. The course at Wellesley College is a 
graduate course and therefore requires more than four years. The 
course leading to a degree in the University of Cincinnati is a five- 
year course. 
GRADUATE COURSES FOR KINDERGARTEN TEACHERS 
The recent changes in the aims and methods of elementary edu- 
cation have created a need on the part of teachers in service for 
courses in the application of the new ideas to the daily schoolroom 
procedure. In order to meet this need many cities have organized 
extension courses for the several groups of teachers. These are 
sometimes optional, but more frequently required. Since the 
changes in the materials and methods of the kindergarten are very 
marked, courses in kindergarten education are usually included. 
These usually deal with the newer aspects, such as the use of the 
new materials, the new methods of recording children’s progress, 
mental measurements, and the unification of the kindergarten and 
first grade. Such courses are being given in a number of the large 
cities—Cleveland and Detroit, under the auspices of their respective 
colleges of education; Baltimore, under the direction of the educa- 
tional department of Johns, Hopkins University; and Cincinnati, 
under the auspices of the University of Cincinnati. 
Closely related to such courses in purpose and character are those 
given during the summer sessions of State normal schools and teach- 
ers colleges and private institutions. Among the State institutions 
kindergarten courses are given in many of those that give such 
courses during the year. The number of private institutions that 
give summer work is comparatively small. The teachers who at- 
tend these summer schools are likely to be of varying degrees of 
experience and to have varied needs. In consequence, varied courses 
are offered. Like those taking the city extension courses, these 
teachers wish for credits that will contribute to the securing of pro- 
motions or salary increases or that will count toward a degree. The 
number of teachers who attend summer sessions is astonishingly 
large, perhaps not fewer than 250,000. This attendance was re- 
quired in many cases to enable teachers to meet the new professional 
qualifications that the States had set. ‘Thousands of others attended 
of their own volition, because they wished to improve their prepara- 
tion. Among these were many kindergarten teachers.
-P-A-G-E-228
  994 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1922-1924 
The offering of advanced courses in kindergarten education and 
the granting of degrees in that subject have contributed very mate- 
rially to the progress of the kindergarten movement. Much of 
the kindergarten training in the past has dealt with the kindergarten 
only, and thereby prevented the kindergarten graduate from doing 
the best work because she did not see her own work as a part of the 
whole educational process. This condition could be remedied only 
by broadening the training teacher’s preparation. That this broad- 
ening is in progress is shown by the replies to an inquiry sent out in 
1924 asking for the names of the kindergarten instructors in the 
order of their rank and the degrees, if any, held by each. Replies 
were received from all but 10. They show that a remarkable advance 
in scholarship has been made in this group in the past few years. 
They show that 71 of the heads of the 145 kindergarten training in- 
stitutions or departments that replied hold college degrees and that 
a corresponding number of the instructors in the kindergarten sub- 
jects in these institutions hold degrees also. Of the entire group, 
51 hold master’s degrees also, 2 hold doctor’s degrees, and 1 the 
degree of doctor of laws. This progress is cumulative, like that in 
several other lines, and can not be measured by special years, but 
those who are familiar with the development of kindergarten train- 
ing know how great an advance it is. 
KINDERGARTEN-PRIMARY COURSES A STEP FORWARD 
This larger scholarship on the part of training teachers has been 
one of the factors in the organization of combined kindergarten- 
primary courses to supersede the separate kindergarten and primary 
courses. The lack of unity between the work’of the kindergarten 
and that of the grades has been due in no small degree to the differ- 
ences in the training of kindergarten and primary teachers. Each 
may have been good of its kind, but the basis for unity was lack- 
ing when prospective kindergarten teachers were instructed in the 
work of the kindergarten only and primary teachers in that of the 
grades only. In consequence neither saw her own work in its right 
relation to that of the other, since neither saw it as a part of a con- 
tinuous whole. With a larger knowledge of the child’s development 
on the part of both and a type of training that covers both the 
kindergarten and the primary grades, a secure foundation is laid 
for the continuity essential to real progress. 
The organization of such courses has been a matter of progressive 
development. A few have been in existence for a number of years, 
but the majority have been organized within the past five years. In 
Pennsylvania the curricula of all the State normal schools were 
reorganized in 1921 so that each school would have four types, each  
-P-A-G-E-229
  
PROGRESS IN KINDERGARTEN EDUCATION 225 
of which would prepare for a definite type of work. A kindergarten- 
primary course was one of the four. Action of the same general 
character was taken by several other States—California, Kansas, 
Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, and perhaps others. 
A study made in 1923 of the catalogues of more than 100 institutions 
that give such courses showed that considerable experimentation will 
be necessary to make these courses serve the purposes for which they 
came into existence. If the idea that underlies the course is carried 
out, the work should cover the four to eight year period; i. e., that of 
the kindergarten and the first and second grades. It is therefore 
evident that there should be a fair balance between the time devoted 
to the work of the children of kindergarten age and those of the 
primary age. In this respect, however, the courses are still far 
apart. A number of these, those in the State normal schools and 
teachers colleges in particular, devote relatively little time to the 
work for kindergarten children and the major part of it to the grade 
work. In the private kindergarten training institutions one is likely 
to find the emphasis on the kindergarten side and but a small amount 
of time devoted to the primary work. 
In consequence, the first ones are in effect primary courses with a 
slight kindergarten flavor, and the second kindergarten courses with 
a slight primary flavor. This is doubtless due to the fact that the 
majority of graduates of the first-named institutions will teach in 
the primary grades and the majority of those in the second in kinder- 
gartens. This may be true, but it is evident that such courses are 
kindergarten-primary courses in name rather than in fact. The real 
purpose of such a course should be the preparation of teachers 
capable of teaching either kindergarten or primary work, or both. 
Unless this purpose is carried out the preparation of either the 
kindergarten or primary teacher will be inadequate. In a course in 
which the emphasis is on the primary side the training of the pros- 
pective kindergarten teacher will be weak, and in one in which the 
emphasis is on the kindergarten the prospective primary teacher 
will lack adequate training. As a result the work with the children 
will lack the continuity that. it should have during the six to eight 
year period. A balance between the time devoted to the work of one 
type and that of the other is therefore essential if a kindergarten- 
primary course is to be true to its name. The organization of such 
courses is a step forward, but much remains to be done to make the 
progress real. 
The study referred to was a response to many requests for infor- 
mation and suggestions as to the organization of kindergarten- 
primary courses, and it has therefore been issued as a Bureau of 
Education bulletin, entitled “An Evaluation of Kindergarten-
-P-A-G-E-230
    226 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1922-1924 
Primary Courses in Teacher-Training Institutions.” This contains 
suggestions as to the means of improving the courses in order that 
they may accomplish their ultimate purpose—the strengthening of 
the beginnings of education by a more complete unification of the 
kindergarten and primary grades. 
IV. PROGRESS IN KINDERGARTEN LEGISLATION 
In the matter of kindergarten legislation there has been reasonably 
good progress. Two kindergarten laws were enacted in 1923. The 
first of these was in New Mexico, which up to that date had no kin- 
dergarten law. The second was in Illinois, which, in the same year, 
amended its permissive law by adding a mandatory-on-petition 
feature. The two laws are as follows: 
New Mexico kindergarten law.—Serction 1425. New Mexico School Code, 
1923: Any school in a district having 200 or more pupils in average daily 
attendance shall have power to establish and maintain, through their govern- 
ing authorities, kindergartens for the instruction of resident children of the 
district between 4 and 6 years of age, the cost thereof to be included in the 
budget allowance of the district and paid from tax proceeds as other mainte- 
nance expenses are paid. The State board of education shall have the power 
to prescribe the course of training, study, and discipline for said kindergartens. 
No person shall teach kindergarten schools without a diploma from a reputable 
kindergarten teacher's institute or without passing an examination in kinder- 
garten work prescribed by the State board of education. 
Illinois kindergarten law..—Srcrion 115. The board of school directors shall 
be clothed with the following powers: * * * 
Sixteenth. To establish kindergartens for the instruction of children between 
the ages of 4 and 6 years, if, in their judgment, the public interest requires it, 
and to pay the necessary expenses of the same out of the school funds of the 
district. Upon petition of a majority of the parents or guardians of children 
between the ages of 4 and 6 residing within any school district where such 
kindergarten is proposed to be established, the board of directors shall, if 
funds are available, establish a kindergarten in connection with the public 
school designated in the petition, and shall maintain such kindergarten as long 
as the annual average daily attendance therein is not less than 15: And pro- 
vided further, That such petition must be signed by at least 50 persons living 
within 1 mile of said public school who are parents or guardians of one or 
more children between the ages of 4 and 6. No one shall be employed to teach 
in a kindergarten who does not hold a kindergarten certificate as provided 
by law. 
  There are now but four States that have not yet adopted kinder- 
garten laws, viz, Arkansas, Georgia, Maryland, and Mississippi. 
In four others, Massachusetts, Nebraska, New Hampshire, and Rhode 
Island, kindergartens may be established without legislation for that 
purpose because of the low age for school entrance.

PROGRESS IN KINDERGARTEN EDUCATION 227 
INFORMATION ABOUT KINDERGARTEN LAWS NOW AVAILABLE 
One of the difficulties in securing the enactment of kindergarten 
laws, or the improvement of existing ones, has been that information 
about these laws and the respects in which they need improvement 
has been difficult to obtain. Bills have failed of passage because they 
did not show an acquaintance with the needs and conditions in a 
given State. To acquaint those interested in kindergarten progress 
with kindergarten legislation has been one of the needs of this 
biennium. This information can now be had. An article on kinder- 
garten laws and the points in which those of the different States 
need improvement was published in the November, 1924, issue of 
School Life, an official publication of the Bureau of Education; and 
a, bulletin entitled “ Kindergarten Legislation ” has just been issued. 
The bureau also has a mimeographed circular entitled “ Suggestions 
Concerning Kindergarten Legislation,” which can be procured free 
of charge. 
V. NEW KINDERGARTEN LITERATURE 
The number of books, bulletins, and circulars concerning the kin- 
dergarten and of value to it written during the period from 1922— 
1924 furnishes additional evidence of the progress of the kindergar- 
ten movement. Books on the kindergarten and the conception of 
education that it illustrates are not lacking, but many of these that 
have been written belong to an earlier period and do not meet pres- 
ent-day problems. A new type of literature is therefore needed, and 
the books of the past two years are of the kind to meet the new need. 
The first kindergarten books in this country were the works of 
Froebel, or the translations of these, and the interpretations of their 
message by William N. Hailman, Susan E. Blow, James L. Hughes, 
and Denton J. Snider. These constituted a distinct contribution to 
the literature of American education, and some years later they were 
followed by a number of books of a different type. Among them 
were “ Children’s Rights” and “Kindergarten Principles and Prac- 
tice,” by Kate Douglas Wiggin and her sister, Nora A. Smith; “A 
Study of Child Nature” and others, by Elizabeth Harrison; and 
“Love and Law in Child Training,” by Emelie Poulsson. The main 
purpose of these books was to acquaint the public, and mothers in 
particular, with the kindergarten as an institution and the principles 
that underlie its procedure. These also had a place in the educa- 
tional literature of the period. 
The better knowledge of the child’s development, which recent 
years have made available, has shown the need of many changes in 
the curriculum and methods of the schools, the kindergartens in- 
cluded. The grades needed a curriculum broadened to include games
-P-A-G-E-232
228 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1922-1924 
and play for the development of the child’s body, experiment and 
construction for the acquisition of skill, and literature and music for 
the cultivation of the higher interests. They also needed methods 
that would allow initiative and self-expression on the part of the 
children. The kindergarten had games, handwork, song, and story- 
telling from the beginning, but its play material was open to criticism 
from the standpoint of size and organization and the methods of 
using these. Both kindergarten and primary grades, therefore, 
needed changes in material and methods, although in different lines. 
In consequence experimentation and adjustment were needed in both 
kindergarten and grades, separately, and in their relation to each 
other. The fact that such experimentation was in progress made 
those who were engaged in it hesitate to publish any conclusions 
they might draw, knowing that these might be tentative only. This 
is one reason why so few books on the kindergarten have been written 
in recent years. Many reports of studies and experiments have been 
made, some of which have been published in periodicals from time 
to time. But few of these have been put into permanent form and 
have not therefore been generally available. The studies entitled 
“ Experimental Studies in Kindergarten Theory and Practice,” made 
by a group of Teachers College specialists of Columbia University, 
were put into available form, however, and have been helpful and 
stimulating to other experimenters. The period of experimentation 
is by no means over, but the principles that are to guide the practice 
of the future have become fairly clear. As a result, a new educa- 
tional literature is appearing in all phases of education. The sev- 
eral books that have been written about the kindergarten during the 
past two years represent the new educational ideals and practice and 
are therefore greatly needed. 
These books may be divided into groups according to the problems 
with which they deal. The first three deal with current problems of 
curriculum and method and are therefore grouped together. The 
first one is “A Conduct Curriculum for the Kindergarten and First 
Grade.” This was directed by Patty Smith Hill and compiled by a 
group of kindergarten and first-grade teachers from the Horace 
Mann School. This book is significant, in part because it is the 
first of a series of monographs on childhood education, and also 
because it stresses character training as the main objective in the 
work with young children. It shows how subject matter and method 
may be organized to that end. 
The second of these books, in the order of publication, was “ Early 
Childhood Education,” by Lalla H. Pickett, director of the training 
school, and Duralde Boren, kindergarten director of the East Texas 
State Normal College, Commerce, Tex. It discusses the underlying 
principles of education for early childhood, the materials to be
-P-A-G-E-233
PROGRESS IN KINDERGARTEN EDUCATION 229 
used, and the curriculum of both kindergarten and first grade from 
the new standpoint. It illustrates the work of these by descriptions 
of typical days in each. 
The third book, entitled “ Unified Kindergarten and First-Grade 
Teaching,” was written by S. Chester Parker and Alice Temple, both 
of the School of Education, University of Chicago. This book traces 
the history of the effort to unify the kindergarten and the first 
grade, shows the objectives in a unified program, the psychological 
organization of the curriculum, and the daily progress. 
Closely related to the foregoing, in meeting a current need, is 
“A Practical Handbook for Students in Observation, Participation, 
and Teaching in Kindergarten, First, Second, and Third Grades.” 
This book was compiled for use in teacher-training classes by Wini- 
fred E. Bain, Gertrude Burns, and Eva Jane Van Sistine, graduate 
students of the University of Chicago. 
The other works on the kindergarten written during this biennium 
do not constitute a homogeneous group like those already mentioned 
but are valuable in meeting other needs. One of them is “A Be- 
ginner’s Book in Religion,” by Edna Dean Baker, of the National 
Kindergarten and Elementary College, Chicago, Ill. This book is 
practically a manual of suggestions for carrying on a Sunday-school 
kindergarten, on the basis of present-day educational and religious 
thought, but is equally valuable for the home. 
Another book, “The Unseen Side of the Child’s Life,” by Eliza- 
beth Harrison, is the third treatise of a trio by the same author and 
is marked by the same insight into child life that characterizes her 
other works. 
A third book is “ Spontaneous and Supervised Play in Childhood,” 
by Alice Corbin Sies, formerly assistant professor of childhood edu- 
cation, University of Pittsburgh, and supervisor of playgrounds for 
small children, city of Pittsburgh. It is a study of the outdoor play 
of young children that has many suggestions for both kindergarten 
and primary teachers. 
A book entitled “ Parenthood and Child Nurture,” by Edna Dean 
Baker, of the National Kindergarten and Elementary College, will 
have a great value for parents who wish to know the fundamental 
facts of their children’s development and the methods of utilizing the 
facts so as to get the best results. 
“Children’s Drawings,” edited and compiled by Stella Agnes 
McCarty, Goucher College, Baltimore, Md., contains many sugges- 
tions for teachers of young children. This study represents the pur- 
posing, planning, and collective labors of the child-study committee 
of the International Kindergarten Union for three years. 
The books, “Pioneers of the Kindergarten in America” and 
“My Garden of Memories,” constitute a notable contribution to the
-P-A-G-E-234
  
230 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF BDUGATION, 1922-1924 
history of the kindergarten movement. The larsb consists of sketches 
of the early leaders and was prepared by a committee of the Inter- 
national Kindergarten Union. The second is the autobiography of 
Kate Douglas Wiggin, who was herself one of the kindergarten 
pioneers. 
The foregoing list would not be complete if it did not mention two 
books, each of which has a chapter on the kindergarten. The first is 
“The Preschool Child,” by Arnold Gesell, M. D., director of Yale 
psycho-clinie and professor of child hygiene, Yale University. In 
this work Doctor Gesell characterizes the kindergarten as “the ves- 
tibule of our vast public-school system” and points out the respon- 
sibilities that devolve upon it because of its strategic position. This 
is a work of special significance in view of the present interest in 
the preschool child. The second book, “The Primary School,” by 
Annie E. Moore, Teachers College, Columbia University, deals with 
the problems of the primary grades as a whole. The chapter on the 
lindergarten touches upon its history as a part of the school and its 
increasing adjustment to the school as a whole. 
The literature of the kindergarten has been augmented also from 
other sources. In September, 1924, a new kindergarten periodical 
was launched, entitled “Childhood Education,” which is the organ 
of the International Kindergarten Union. A monograph entitled 
“General Practice in Kindergarten Education in the United States ” 
has been issued by the National Education Association. This is by 
Mary Dabney Davis, in cooperation with the research committee 
of the department of kindergarten education of that organization. 
The educational periodicals have published some 20 articles on the 
subject and the National Kindergarten Association several leaflets 
and circulars. The Bureau of Education has published 12 bulletins 
and circulars on different phases of kindergarten work. Those bear- 
ing on the training of kindergarten teachers and on kindergarten 
legislation have already been mentioned. Among the others are 
Circular No. 9, “ How the Kindergarten Makes Americans,” by Earl 
Barnes; Gixcular No. 18, “ Prefirst-grade Training,” by William T. 
Root; and No. 17, “ Homi the Kindergarten Aids Children’s Progress 
in the Grades.” 
VI. NEW LINES OF EFFORT 
KKINDERGARTENS IN CONSOLIDATED RURAL SCHOOLS 
The fact that the number of children enrolled in kindergartens 
constitute but a small proportion of the children of kindergarten 
age in the country at large has been stated elsewhere. ‘The outstand- 
ing reason for this is that nearly 50 per cent of the children in the   
 
-P-A-G-E-235
  PROGRESS IN KINDERGARTEN EDUCATION 231 
country at large live in small rural communities or the open country. 
Of these children, thousands have had no educational advantages 
except those which the one-room rural school affords. It is for the 
purpose of providing educational facilities, comparable in some 
degree to those of city children, that the consolidated rural school 
has come into existence. There is no reason why such schools 
should not include kindergartens or kindergarten-primary depart- 
ments in which the needs of children from 4 to 6 years of age could 
be met. The movement for the consolidation of rural schools is 
still new, however, and has difficulties of its own to meet. It is not, 
therefore, surprising that only a few of these schools have yet in- 
cluded kindergartens. Several have been established, however— 
one or more in each of the States of Connecticut, Florida, Michigan, 
Ohio, and Iowa. The last-named State seems to have taken the 
lead in the matter, as its school directory for 1923-24 shows kinder- 
gartens to have been established in 18 consolidated schools in 15 
counties. Of these, 10 are in communities of fewer than 1,000 in- 
habitants. In one of them the population is only 150. 
The fact that kindergartens have been organized in the schools 
of these widely scattered villages implies an increasing recognition 
of the needs of children from 4 to 6 years of age, rural as well as 
urban, that only the kindergarten can truly meet. Rural life may 
and often does contribute much to a little child’s development—in 
the contact with nature that it affords and the opportunities for 
play that it provides. The facts of nature need to be interpreted 
to children, however, if they are to become truly significant. In 
many schools these facts are given no place on the program, and 
the children see no connection between the trees, flowers, or sunset 
within their vision and the story of these as told in poem or picture. 
The farm affords companionship for the little child, that of parents, 
brothers, and sisters, and even that of the animals, but it seldom 
affords the opportunity for that most valuable type of play, that 
with children of his own age. In this play children need the guid- 
ance of an adult, just as they need direction in their nature observa- 
tion and other activities. The guidance of children’s interests and 
activities into worth-while channels is the specific work of the kinder- 
garten. For the sake of children’s fullest development and their 
greater happiness it is therefore hoped that the number of kinder- 
gartens in the consolidated schools may increase. 
The needs of children of preschool age are at present in the focus 
of public attention. The establishing of kindergartens in such 
schools would furnish one way in which that interest could function 
for the benefit of the rural children. This movement originated 
 
-P-A-G-E-236
  232 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1922-1924 
during the present biennium. It was at the Boston meeting of the 
National Education Association in 1922 that the first public address 
on the subject was given by Mrs. Katharine M. Cook, chief of the 
Rural Division of the U. S. Bureau of Education. It was during 
the same year that a circular was issued on the subject, entitled 
“Principles in the Consolidated Rural School.” This is Bureau of 
Education Rural School Leaflet No. 18, written by Mrs. Cook. 
THE NURSERY-SCHOOL MOVEMENT 
The nursery-school movement is one of great significance for 
early elementary education, since some of these schools are serving 
as laboratories for securing more adequate knowledge of young 
children’s development. This movement is new in the United States. 
A few such schools were organized several years ago, that in the 
Waldin School, New York City, in 1915; in the Bureau of Educa- 
tional Experiments in 1919; and in the Merrill-Palmer School, 
Detroit, in 1920. The movement received a great impetus in 1922 
from a course of lectures on the subject given by Miss Grace Owen, 
one of the leaders of the movement in England, who had been 
brought to the United States by Teachers College for that purpose. 
One of the New York day nurseries was used as a demonstration 
school to illustrate the character of nursery school work. During 
the same year the Ruggles Street Day Nursery, of Boston, was 
made into a nursery school. Since that time nursery schools have 
been organized in several cities. Just how many could not be 
learned, since many of the 600 day nurseries in the country have 
adopted the name, sometimes without justification. Day nurseries 
as such are philanthropic in character, and as a rule lack the scien- 
tific and educational aspects that characterize the true nursery 
school. As far as could be learned, about 25 real nursery schools 
have been organized in 16 different cities. They are as follows: 
Boston, Cambridge, Chicago, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Detroit, High- 
land Park, Los Angeles, Missoula, Montclair, New Haven, New 
York, Philadelphia, Pocatello, Schenectady, and Washington, D. C. 
These nursery schools are of different types and serve different 
purposes. Some are practically underage kindergartens, often in 
public schools. Although it may not be possible to provide all the 
nursery-school features under these conditions, the children have 
clean and wholesome rooms, opportunities for play and handwork, 
usually under the guidance of a trained kindergarten teacher, and 
medical inspection such as that given the older pupils. Whether the 
session is for a half day or the whole day, and whether sleeping 
facilities are provided, depends on the conditions, In some cases the   
 
-P-A-G-E-237
  PROGRESS IN KINDERGARTEN EDUCATION 233 
work is so organized as to include instruction to the mothers. Kin- 
dergartens of this kind are to be found in Cincinnati, Cleveland, 
Washington, D. C., and several other cities. 
Of a different type are the neighborhood cooperative nursery 
schools that have been established in several cities. As a rule these 
are organized and carried on by a committee of parents, under the 
guidance of or in cooperation with an expert in child care and train- 
ing. Nursery schools of this type often serve as a laboratory for the 
mothers in a scientifié study of the development of their own and 
their neighbors’ children. It is in this type of work that the Ameri- 
can Association of University Women is rendering a great service. 
The cooperation is of different types, sometimes financial and some- 
times educational. The University Cooperative Nursery School of 
Chicago is conducted by the University Cooperative Nursery School 
Association, the university providing the room. In Missoula, Mont., 
the cooperation is between the parents of the children, the University 
of Montana, and the American Association of University Women. 
This organization has been instrumental in organizing 19 nursery 
schools of this type and 99 preschool study clubs. The participation 
of this organization in work of this type is very new, the resolution 
to do so having been made at the national meeting of 1923. The 
funds for this work are contributed by the Laura Spelman Memorial 
Fund. ‘ 
The nursery schools of the types described doubtless contribute to 
the scientific training of a considerable number of parents, but this 
is but one of the purposes that the nursery school serves. One of 
these is the training of nursery school teachers. Since adequately 
trained teachers are essential to the progress of the movement, 
several institutions have organized courses and training facilities in 
these lines. 
As far as known the institutions giving such training are the 
Merrill-Palmer School, Detroit; Teachers College, Columbia Univer- 
sity, New York City; the Ruggles Street Nursery School and Train- 
ing Center, Boston; the Cleveland Kindergarten Training School, 
Cleveland; Temple University, Philadelphia; and Southern Branch 
of the University of California, Los Angeles. It is evident that 
training for nursery school work must be based upon first-hand 
knowledge of children, and for this the nursery school furnishes one 
of the opportunities. The content of the courses must follow the lines 
in which knowledge is most needed. Most of the courses are still in 
the experimental stage, however, and need not be discussed here. 
A number of nursery schools are serving as research centers for 
still another end. This is the securing of data concerning children’s 
development in specific lines, for use as the knowledge of it may be
-P-A-G-E-238

needed, or for the formulating of general principles for the guidance 
of educational procedure. Very valuable work has been done in 
these and related lines in the Iowa Child Welfare Research Station, 
the Yale Psycho-Clinic, and the Bureau of Educational Experi- 
ments in New York City. Such books as Doctor Gesell’s “ Preschool 
Child,” Baldwin and Stecker’s “ Psychology of the Preschool Child,” 
and Johnson’s “A Nursery School Experiment” are the results of 
such experiments and of great value to all students of childhood.

ADULT EDUCATION FOR FOREIGN-BORN AND NATIVE 
ILLITERATES 
By Cuartes M. Herurmy 
State Supervisor of Adult Alien Education for Massachusetts 
Conrents.—Americanism and Americanization—Significant Federal census data on size of the immigrant 
education problem—Size of national illiteracy problem among the native born—A national survey of State 
programs of adult education in 1925—Federal leadership in adult education—References. 
AMERICANISM AND AMERICANIZATION 
Americanism embraces the ideals of the good citizen in politi- 
eal, social, economic, and cultural relationships. The defini- 
tion and interpretation of these ideals determine the scope of one’s 
understanding of the movement of Americanization; that is, those 
programs and activities that aim to promote Americanism. 
It is commonly understood that Americanization work is re- 
stricted to education and social service for the foreign born. The 
school programs of English and citizenship for adult aliens are 
generally termed Americanization.. The school supervisors and 
teachers in this new type of work, however, are the first to deny 
that the foreign born are the only group that need instruction and 
help in learning the principles and ideals that govern the conduct 
of the good citizen. Moreover, the experienced worker with the 
foreign born realizes that we can not Americanize immigrants until 
our native born practice in their daily lives those principles which are 
commonly understood to be the distinguishing marks of citizenship 
in the United States. Granting the aim of this work to be the pro- 
moting of better citizenship, then the correction of every un-American 
condition may properly be termed ‘‘Americanization work.” 
Consider our outstanding social problems in America to-day. 
Ignorance based on illiteracy, due in turn to inadequate school 
support, racial and religious prejudices and. intolerance, poverty, 
dependency, and all types of social inadequacies are certainly not 
limited to immigrants. And the correction of these conditions is 
very definitely a part of our national Americanization problem. 
In our political life we have the discomforting situation illustrated 
in the national election of 1924, when 30,000,000 citizens failed to 
vote. The percentage of nonvoters in the native-born group was 
larger in several sections of the country than that of the naturalized 
235
-P-A-G-E-240
  
  236 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1922-1924 
citizens. This neglect of the highest privilege of citizenship by 50 
per cent of the eligible voters is a most serious phase of our Ameri- 
canization problem. 
The flood of trashy novels, magazines, motion pictures, and 
plays that is poured out annually to satisfy the low standards of 
the American public to-day deserves much more attention from 
parents, educators, and clergymen than is apparently given. Raising 
the general level of appreciation is obviously a part of our national 
problem of bettering citizenship. 
The term ‘“‘Americanization” is in disrepute among a large number 
of the intelligent leaders of the foreign groups in this country. This 
is due very largely to the utterances of those Americans who believe 
that the immigrant must conform absolutely to certain fixed stand- 
ards of thinking and acting in the United States. Despite the 
fact that there is no agreement and obviously never will be any 
agreement as to the definition of these standards, it would be absurd 
for America to scrap the magnificent contributions which her im- 
migrants have brought not only to our industrial and agricultural 
productivity, but more important still, to the spiritual and cultural 
life of America. As a Jewish mother in an English class in Chicago 
well said: 
Some of the things taught me in the Old World which I want my children to 
preserve are respect for parents, tue teacher, and old age. The tradition for 
thoroughness and honesty of purpose is also one that the people of the New 
World would do well to follow. The race for success may result in subordinating 
religion, high moral standards, and the fine arts, and in considering material 
gain as the height of achievement. 
Are not the standards of conduct and the appreciation of the nobler 
things of life as expressed by this immigrant mother valuable con- 
tributions to America? 
John Daniels, in America Via the Neighborhood, states that 
Americanization does not mean rigid conformity or injection, but 
does involve the intelligent participation of native and foreign 
born in America’s upbuilding. 
The aim of any sound Americanization program is to promote an 
intelligent, loyal, united citizenry. The millions of immigrants who 
have come to America in the past, and those who will continue to 
come voluntarily in the future, have services to render and gifts to 
offer, if we but understand their motives and treat them fairly. The 
evolving of American life and the raising of our standards of citizen- 
ship depend on the joint contributions of native and foreign born 
working together in a spirit of friendly understanding and cheerful 
cooperation. Americanization applies directly to the immigrant, but 
the native American must see to it that his life exemplifies the Ameri- 
canism which we wish the immigrant to emulate.

FOREIGN-BORN AND NATIVE ILLITERATES 237 
SIGNIFICANT FEDERAL CENSUS DATA ON SIZE OF THE IMMIGRANT 
EDUCATION PROBLEM 
Granting the general definition that Americanization has to do 
with promoting good citizenship for the native and foreign born, 
we shall consider now the problem of education for immigrants, and 
especially the approximate number that need school help. 
No immigrant can participate intelligently in American life unless 
he has a good working knowledge of English. He must speak and un- 
derstand our language, and should be able to read and write simple 
English. Moreover, he should be familiar with the important eras 
of American history and the significant facts in our national develop- 
ment. He must understand the form of our Government, the duties 
and privileges of a citizen, and the real meaning of citizenship in our 
Republic. The ability to use English and a knowledge of American 
history and Government are not as essential for his Americanization 
as a genuine feeling of loyalty to the United States. No one can 
command or control the immigrant’s feelings toward America, but 
fortunately most of these newcomers are well disposed when they 
come. The schools can teach English, history, and civics, but the 
inculcation of loyalty can come only through inspiration from con- 
tacts with good American citizens. 
How many immigrants are there in the United States, and how 
many need school help in the Americanization process? The 1920 
Federal census shows the following: 
1. Total number of foreign-born persons------------ 18, 712, 754 
2.- Lotel number of: aliens— 25° = 23 45--  see eS 4, 364, 909 
3. Total number of illiterate foreign born (unable to 
write in any language and presumably unable to 
TORN) Fi? SNe Fo Date ed eee be 1, 763, 740 
It is obvious that all illiterate immigrants who possess normal 
physical and mental faculties would be helped by attending English 
classes. 
No data are available to show what percentage of the 4,364,909 
aliens need school help. Undoubtedly many well-educated immi- 
grants can fit themselves for citizenship by private home study and 
reading. On the other hand, most aliens, from non-English-speaking 
countries in particular, would be benefited by instruction in English 
and citizenship. This means attendance at evening classes by all 
except those who would benefit from private or correspondence 
instruction. Regardless of educational attainments, any immigrant 
who aspires to become a citizen should receive from the United States 
Government authoritative, definite, practical information as to the 
methods and requirements of naturalization. On these general 
principles it is fair to assume that more than 3,000,000 aliens need 
school help before taking the oath of allegiance to the Government 
of the United States.

Care must be exercised in interpreting the above statistics on the 
number of foreign born reported as aliens in 1920. These totals 
have been increased by the number of new arrivals and have been 
decreased by the number who have been naturalized during the 
five-year period from 1920 to 1925. The number of aliens admitted 
to citizenship in the United States during the fiscal year July 1, 
1923, to June 30, 1924, was 150,510. Using this figure as an 
average, the total number admitted since 1920 is 750,000, which 
represents approximately 17 per cent of the total number reported in 
1920. A deduction of 20 per cent from the total for any State would 
give a fair estimate of the number of alien’ in 1925. 
No statistics are available to show the number of illiterate foreign- 
born adults who have learned to read and write during the five-year 
period since 1920. 
SIZE OF NATIONAL ILLITERACY PROBLEM AMONG THE NATIVE 
BORN 
The native illiterate population in the United States by the 1920 
Federal census, is as follows: Native white illiterates, 1,242,572; 
native negro illiterates, 1,842,161. It is significant to note that the 
native illiterate group represents 64 per cent of our total national 
illiteracy problem. The total number of native illiterates in 1920, 
however, shows a marked decrease as compared with the number in 
1910 and 1900. The 3,000,000 citizens of the United States who are
-P-A-G-E-243
  FOREIGN-BORN AND NATIVE ILLITERATES 239 
unable to read and write constitute a challenge to American educa- 
tion. The immediate extension of adequate programs of adult 
  
  
  
    
    
        
        
     
         elementary education would insure a marked reduction of illiterates 
in the census of 1930.

The social, political, economic, and cultural losses due to illiteracy 
can not be estimated. Disrespect for law, disregard for personal 
and community health standards, suspicion, ignorance, and an 
undemocratic point of view—all these undesirable conditions are 
generally found in districts with high percentages of illiterate adults. 
A NATIONAL SURVEY OF STATE PROGRAMS OF ADULT EDUCATION 
IN 1925 
In May, 1925, the Federal Commissioner of Education sent a 
questionnaire + on elementary education in English and citizenship 
for adults to every State superintendent of education in the United 
States. The questions asked in this report covered the following: 
1. State legislation favoring this work. 
2. State educational leadership. 
3. State financial assistance. 
4. Number of local communities providing adult classes. 
5. Number of adult students enrolled in 1923 and 1924. 
6. State teacher-training help for adult classes. 
7. Present outlook for this work. 
Returns were received from 44 of the 48 States and from Alaska, 
Virgin Islands, Canal Zone, and Hawaii. 
“Tt Results of the questionnaire appear on a following page.

The following summaries show the returns according to geographi-

-P-A-G-E-245
  FOREIGN-BORN AND NATIVE ILLITERATES 241 
In addition to the 286,000 students recorded officially from the 25 
States in the above survey, there are undoubtedly 50,000 adults 
enrolled in classes in the larger cities of those States, which have not 
provided State leadership for this work; for example, Chicago, 
Detroit, St. Louis, Baltimore, Trenton, New Orleans, and Milwaukee. 
This grand total of more than 336,000 adult students is the most 
significant proof of the strength of the adult elementary education 
Imovement in the United States. Despite waning of public interest in 
mericanization and the serious retrenchment policy in public ex- 
penditures, the school programs for native illiterates and adult 
oreign born have steadily improved during the past five years, and 
the general outlook for the Nation is most promising. 
The 1920 Federal census shows that every State in the Union has 
ore than 10,000 foreign-born adults and native illiterates. Thirty- 
our States to date have recognized the importance and the need of 
ublic-school programs for adults needing elementary civic instruc- 
ion and have enacted legislation favoring this work. It is significant 
o note, however, that in only 27 of these States has the work been 
ecognized by the State department of education as deserving the 
ervices of a supervisor on full time or part time. 
The rapid development and expansion of adult programs in those 
tates where trained leaders have been appointed in the department 
f education prove the value and need for personal leadership in the 
5 States and Territories where no professional leadership has been 
rovided. 
Financial aid to local communities conducting adult classes is 
rovided by 27 States. The form of State aid varies considerably, 
ut the general practice in most of the States is to furnish reimburse- 
ent on the dollar for dollar basis. The Massachusetts State-aid 
aw,? which has been copied in several Eastern States, is as follows: 
Src. 9. The department, with the cooperation of any town applying therefor, 
ay provide for such instruction in the use of English for adults unable to speak, 
ead, or write the same, and in the fundamental principles of government and other 
ubjects adapted to fit for American citizenship, as shall jointly be approved by 
he local school committee and the department. Schools and classes established 
herefor may be held in public-school buildings, in industrial establishments, or 
n such other places as may be approved in like manner. Teachers and super- 
isors employed therein by a town shall be chosen and their compensation fixed 
y the school committee, subject to the approval of the department. 
Sec. 10. At the expiration of each school year, and on approval by the depart- 
ent, the Commonwealth shall pay to every town providing such instruction in 
onjunction with the department one-half the amount expended for supervision 
nd instruction by such town for said year. 
The teaching of English and citizenship to adult aliens requires a. 
ethodology and subject matter quite distinct from the work in day 
chools for children. Special training is essential for good teaching

-P-A-G-E-246
  242 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1922-1924 
of adults, and the increased enrollment in States where such training 
has been provided is due in large measure to the indorsements of the 
new type of teaching by the immigrants and native illiterates who 
have been taught by trained experts who know what to teach, how 
to teach, and how much to teach. There is no more important or 
valuable form of State service than that of training teachers. Four- 
teen States offer such training. Obviously, there is an urgent need 
for the immediate expansion of this phase of the work in every State.

FOREIGN-BORN AND NATIVE ILLITERATES 245 
FEDERAL LEADERSHIP IN ADULT EDUCATION 
From 1915 to 1919 the Federal Bureau of Education provided 
educational leadership for immigrant education programs in the 
United States. Mr. H. H. Wheaton and Mr. Fred C. Butler ren- 
dered valuable assistance to the school people and representatives 
of civic organizations who were interested in improving the then 
limited programs of Americanization. This work of the bureau was 
discontinued soon after the war, owing to financial retrenchments. 
The schools suffered when Federal direction was withdrawn, and 
especially in 1919, when public opinion had been educated as to the 
need for Americanization programs by the war-time propaganda on 
this subject. 
The State and local directors of school programs for aliens in 1920 
organized as a department in the National Education Association. 
The outstanding aim of this organization has been to secure Federal 
educational direction for this work. The department of immigrant 
education was enlarged in 1924 to include the supervisors and 
teachers of native illiterates, and the name was changed to the 
National Department of Adult Education of the N. E. A. At the 
1925 meeting of this department in Indianapolis, resolutions were 
adopted indorsing the recently announced competitive examination 
for the position of specialist in adult education in the United States 
Bureau of Education. The appointment of such a specialist will 
undoubtedly strengthen the work nationally and will insure the 
necessary development of adult-education programs in the large 
number of States where the ambitious illiterate and immigrant have 
no opportunity for learning English and preparing for citizenship. 
The immigration restriction laws of 1924 have cut down consider- 
ably the number of new immigrants to be admitted to the United 
States in the future, and consequently the number needing instruc- 
tion in English and citizenship. Attention is called, however, to 
three significant considerations, as follows: 
1. The number of immigrants admitted under the new law in 1924 was 706,896. 
2. The total number of illiterate foreign-born persons residing in the United 
States in 1920 was 1,763,740. 
3. The total number of aliens residing in the United States in 1920 was 
4,364,909. 
Obviously we have a tremendous educational problem on our 
hand in the number of foreign born now here who need school help, 
and an annual influx of approximately 500,000 under the new law is 
large enough to need a continuous program of adult citizenship 
education. 
There is considerable misunderstanding in the minds of many 
people about the need for further work. Surely thé facts set forth in 
the three considerations listed answer this question in convincing

form. No extended reference will be made in this report to the 
educational activities of the Bureau of Naturalization. Suffice it} 
to say that this Federal office has furnished the public schools an| 
abundant supply of lesson materials for English and citizenship} 
classes. The schools have been helped also by the lists of names and 
addresses of applicants for first and second papers provided by the 
bureau. The school people generally have cooperated with the 
Bureau of Naturalization in preparing petitioners for naturalization 
procedure. 
The present outlook for effective cooperation between all public} 
agencies that touch the immigrant in his adjustment to the normal 
life of an American citizen is most hopeful. The schools can not 
accomplish this work alone. School leaders and teachers must invite} 
and seek the active cooperation of every group of citizens interested 
in helping immigrants to become truly Americanized.

  SCHOOL HOUSING 
Steady progress in recent years has been made in the safe and 
healthful housing of school children. From a none too carefully 
constructed box, poorly lighted, and fitfully warmed by a’ central 
stove, which failed in making comfortable the wind-chilled floors, 
furnished with unsuitable benches and with blackboards which belied 
the name, and provided externally with toilets which were often 
striking examples of what such appointments should not be, we have 
come, in a half century or so, to single or consolidated schools hay- 
ing suitable heating apparatus in the basement, the latest toilet 
and lavatory arrangements under the same roof, a well-equipped 
lunchroom, blackboards that are black, abundant illumination, suit- 
able seats, some special features for the comfort of the teacher, and, 
in a word, all necessary facilities (so far as we can now see them), 
for the health of all concerned. Many schools have gone still further 
and have supplied special rooms and equipment for the study of 
home economics, and have provided materially for the physical de- 
velopment of the child by furnishing gymnasiums, baths, and swim- 
ming pools. 
In some respects we may have gone too far in the use of creature 
comforts. We have made use of playrooms and gymnasiums in 
seasons when the playground would have been far more appropriate, 
and it has been discovered that frequently the schoolrooms have been 
kept at such a high temperature as to interfere with the loss of body 
heat and to cause coincident interference with mental activity. 
Perennial reports continue from many quarters of overcrowding 
and double sessions, and the picture of the safe, sanitary, and well-

equipped school does not hold universally. In many parts of the 
country deplorable conditions still exist. According to a Parent- 
Teacher Association survey of the schools of Delaware, “two-thirds 
of the buildings now in use are violating practically all of the health 
standards which it is one of the supreme tasks of the school to teach 
to the children.” : 
The water supply of schools is not always chosen with the care 
that one would expect. An examination of the supplies of 97 of its 
rural schools by the State department of health in Connecticut was 
recently made; of these only 24 were considered satisfactory, and 16 
were pronounced unsafe. 
2 PLAYGROUNDS 
Toward the middle of the nineteenth century the educator, intent 
on adding new subjects to the curriculum and zealous to increase the 
intellectuality of his pupils at all costs, lost sight of the importance 
of the playground and often begrudged the child his two blissful 
respites, the traditional recess periods. Old school grounds were 
encroached upon, and with the rising cost of city lots new school 
sites were limited to little more than a mere space for the building. 
However, in the last quarter of the past century an effort at rescue 
of the playground was begun, and with the efficient assistance of the 
Playground and Recreation Association of America not only is more 
adequate room for play now included in the newer school-building 
programs but opportunity is supplied elsewhere and trained organ- 
izers and directors of play are widely employed. In many cities the 
municipal playgrounds are under the control of the board of educa- 
tion and are directed by employees of that department throughout 
the summer as well as at other seasons. It is the opinion of the 
superintendents of schools in 91 out of 136 large cities that all play- 
grounds should be under the supervision of the department of edu- 
“cation. 
Out of 164 cities affording information on the subject 143 stated 
that playgrounds are provided for every new school building. 
Doubtless in many instances there is much to be desired in the size 
of these grounds, but in at least one State a minimum standard has 
been set of 2 acres for every one-teacher school, 3 acres for every two- 
teacher school, 4 acres for every three-teacher school, and 5 acres for 
every larger elementary school. Ten acres has been set as the mini- 
mum for high schools. These dimensions have been greatly exceeded 
by many schools in more than one State. 
Besides furnishing playgrounds, some effort is made to put the 
grounds in condition for use on as many days of the year as possible 
and to make use of them under special or regular teacher supervision

not only during the school session but after school and on Saturday. 
‘There is no time in the regular curriculum, unless it should undergo 
radical revision, for an adequate program of physical training, and 
it is to wisely supervised after-school and vacation activities that we 
must look for full value in this kind of work. 
MEDICAL INSPECTION 
Medical inspection, or health examination (to use a better term), 
began a half century or so ago in Europe with the examination of 
the vision of pupils. In many sections of this country it has not in 
practice advanced beyond this stage of development, and, although 
42 States have laws requiring or permitting medical inspection, it is 
estimated that half of the children of the country have never so 
much as had their vision tested. The examination of vision was an. 
acknowledgment that the eye is an essential intellectual tool with 
which the pupil works and with which he works best when it is most 
nearly perfect. This idea has not, however, as yet penetrated 
through the dense layer of materialistic tradition with which all our 
minds are still incrusted; for many a teacher wastes time and effort 
year after year working not only with pupils handicapped with 
defective vision, but with children who are dull because deaf, and 
stupid because of badly fueled brains. 
It is true that the mere removal of defects does not affect the 
hereditary basis of poor or good intelligence. It is inadvisable, 
however, to attempt to train children who are mentally hampered 
by remediable bodily defects; though this is carried on to an in- 
credible extent. There are bright spots, it is true, but the general 
picture the country over is not what could be wished. In at least 
one European State every child is thoroughly examined, stripped, by 
a physician three times in his school life, and oftener if his condition 
seems to warrant it. feos 
There is no longer need for examination for the mere sake of 
piling up appalling statistics on the subject of human defects. 
Whether in city or country, East, West, North, or South, the pro- 
portion of physical defects is much the same and is a depressing 
commentary on the fall of man from physical perfection. 
Although the examination by a thoroughly trained physician of 
each child fully stripped would be the ideal practice, the recent 
tendency has been to make of the school nurse or the regular teacher 
at least the preliminary examiner. Even where there are other 
examiners it is the teacher’s business to know the instruments upon 
which she plays, whether they are at their best and remain at their 
best. Without the use of any kind of special instrument she should 
know whether a child is doing good work, whether he shows signs of
-P-A-G-E-254
  250 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1922-1924 
defective vision, is dull of hearing, can not breathe through his nose, 
has decayed teeth, is stooped, or shows other evidence of being im- 
provable. As for the detection of communicable disease, the teacher 
can be the only first-hand observer, and first-hand knowledge of 
such conditions is the only kind worth while. It needs only a com- 
paratively brief period of instruction and of practice to make the 
teacher an excellent examiner, and such training promises to be 
afforded hereafter in her professional education. It has, in fact, 
been begun in a few teacher-training institutions. 
No matter who makes the preliminary examinations, there is need 
in every school system of a thoroughly trained and well-paid medical 
inspector and consultant, for the end of such examination is not to 
find defects but to decide which need to be removed or improved, 
and to have something done about them. 
In the health examination heretofore the persons most concerned 
and whose cooperation is most needed—the parents—have been 
ignored. It is notable that in the past few years this method has 
been undergoing change, and in some cities, where an invitation has 
been extended, the parents have been present to the extent of 75 per 
cent. They furnish to the examiner much valuable first-hand infor- 
mation concerning the child’s physical history and reduce the labors 
of the school nurse whose most important business has been the 
“follow-up ” work of home explanation and persuasion after exami- 
nations. © 
It is a high tribute to the usefulness of the school nurse that, 
although there has been some diminution in the number of full-time 
school physicians, the number of nurses has increased in both urban 
and rural regions; and the number of pupils has, in many instances, 
been reduced to 1,000 per nurse. The employment of school nurses 
in rural communities is increasing rapidly, and wherever a sufli- 
ciently trained and tactful person has been employed she has been 
found to be indispensable. 
A few years ago the administration of medical and dental in- 
spection was about evenly divided between departments of health 
and departments of education, but there is an increasing balance 
on the side of educational authority, especially in small cities. In 
80 per cent of cities with a population of 10,000 to 100,000 furnishing 
information on this subject, the administration of medical inspection 
is under the department of education. This division has been occa- 
sioned by the presence of communicable disease, the management of 
which always falls within the province of the health officials. As 
these diseases are stamped out the health work will become more 
exclusively the field of the department of education, though the crest 
of the wave of public-health activity itself has become purely educa- 
tional. 
 
-P-A-G-E-255
HEALTH AND PHYSIQUE OF SCHOOL CHILDREN 257 
Half of the children of the country are in the rural schools, and 
though these are not better off physically than their city cousins, 
health work, except in spots, is far from adequate. It is particularly 
lacking in organization and direction. In most instances it is still 
waiting on the progress toward better county or district organiza- 
tion in public-health work, if not in education, and these await the 
approval of the taxpayer. 
It is to be regretted that in this country more men broadly inter- 
ested and qualified for directing the health activities of schools, both 
urban and rural, can not be given attractive salaries with sufficient 
time for research, as the opportunities for valuable investigation are 
unlimited. 
DENTAL WORK 
There has been a steady development of dental work in schools. 
In many instances this has been inaugurated by the local dentists, 
though most satisfactory results are obtained where it has been in- 
corporated as a part of the general health work of the school. Be- 
sides the school dentist who attends to fillings, extractions, and align- 
ment, dental hygienists are employed in increasing numbers. In 
addition to examining and cleaning teeth, these workers assist in 
the training of the child in the care for the appearance and preserva- 
tion of these valuable structures. 
Mouths which have never been entered by brush or dentifrice may 
contain the most beautiful teeth, while others which have known the 
most persistent and approved efforts at artificial cleansing may con- 
tain few sound specimens. School work on a large scale has proved 
conclusively that oral hygiene alone has little effect, at any rate 
during school life, in reducing the tendencies to decay. On the 
other hand, recent experiments indicate that the amount of caries 
is noticeably affected within a few months by the character of the 
food. 
The Children’s Bureau, in a study of preschool children in Gary, 
Ind., found that in those whose diet was almost wholly deficient, 
or lacked one or more essential food elements, there were 75.6 per 
cent with carious teeth as compared with 52.1 per cent for others; 
and in experiments on three groups of 7-year-old children, conducted 
by Mellanby, Pattison, and Proud in a London hospital, the effect. 
of deficient diet on the extent of existing caries, and on the increase in 
number of decaying teeth, was evident within a few months. 
Though proper nutrition is essential for good teeth, efforts at oral 
cleanliness are worth while, from the point of view of esthetics if 
from no other, and preservation by prompt filling of all cavities is 
of the utmost importance. The trend, however, in dental prophy- 
laxis is at last toward the removal of the causes of caries through the
-P-A-G-E-256
  
  252 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1922-1924 
use of a diet which will furnish from their prenatal beginning the 
right materials for the making and maintenance of the teeth. 
NUTRITION 
For nearly a century and a half it has been found advisable in 
European States to furnish meals for poorly fed pupils, but otherwise 
the most fundamental subject in hygiene, namely, nutrition, has until 
very recently been nearly neglected. The efforts at improving the 
daily food habits of the child constitute the most important move- 
ment in health work of the age and give promise of the most far- 
reaching results not only healthwise but economically. We have 
hitherto been too much inclined to take it for granted that a child is 
“well fed if he does not starve” or that any kind of food will do for 
him. We are much concerned about the kind and amount of gasoline 
and oil which we put in an automobile, but it has not entered our 
heads that the amount and character of work of the school child is 
at all connected with what he has had for dinner, or, as was long 
ago pointed out by Voltaire, that his disposition depends on his 
digestion. 
In the efforts at improving the nutrition of the more evidently 
malnourished children, whether selected by crude measure of relative 
weight for age and height or by the more trustworthy method of a 
general examination for all the signs of this condition, special classes 
have been organized and even open-air treatment has been afforded 
them. The tendency is, however, except in the most serious cases, to 
go direct to the root of the matter and secure the right feeding and 
other conditions affecting nutrition for all children in the home, if 
possible, and give supplemental feeding in the school only where this 
is deemed necessary for the time being. — 
Certainly where children have not sufficient time, or where the 
distance from home is too great for them to return home at.noon, 
a suitable noon lunch, planned and superintended by the teacher of 
domestic science, is now deemed essential, and this function is made 
use of not only for mere feeding but as an objective part of the 
teaching of hygiene. About one-third of all cities are now furnishing 
this lunch. In rural schools, where suitable provisions for the noon 
meal are of especiai importance, the serving of hot chocolate or soup 
with the food brought by the child is arranged for, while suggestions 
to parents and the distribution of such publications on the subject 
as those issued by the Bureau of Education have made an improve- 
ment in the contents of the lunch basket. 
OPEN-AIR SCHOOLS AND OPEN-WINDOW ROOMS 
Open-air schools and open-window classes are a part of the 
special equipment in about 25 per cent of cities having a population
-P-A-G-E-257
  HEALTH AND PHYSIQUE OF SCHOOL CHILDREN 2538 
of 30,000 and more and in about 10 per cent of those from 10,000 to 
30,000. The proportion has not increased much in a decade. The 
success of these schools, which grew out of methods employed in 
sanitoria for the tuberculous, has, of course, depended on much 
more than pure or cool air; for extra feeding, rest periods, and a 
sympathetic atmosphere have been as important factors in the results 
obtained. 
Open-window classes have been used for the same type of pupils 
where no open-air schools exist or for presumably nontuberculous 
cases of malnutrition. 
As Newmayer says, open-window classes were a “confession that 
only malnutrition cases shall receive fresh air, and this to be given 
at times at uncomfortable temperature.” It is the duty of educators 
to furnish such a necessity as pure air at a comfortable temperature 
to every child in every class. “The lack of fresh air in our schools 
is an indictment against the designers and builders of our school 
plants.” Even if we furnish a pure and not superheated atmosphere 
to only our tuberculous children, we shall have to make such condi- 
tions for a very large per cent of them. 
Children who are suffering from active tuberculosis or other seri- 
ous chronic diseases have no place even in an open-air school. Their 
physical care is paramount, and they should be placed in a pre- 
yentorium or sanitorium, where they can have for 24 hours a day 
the best conditions for healing and recovery. Even in cases of 
serious malnutrition: (which may often be due to tuberculosis) as 
much progress will be made if the mental work be made decidedly 
secondary to physical welfare. 
The rulings made in New York City as to cases suitable for open- 
air schools are as follows 
1. Those who show tuberculous infection but have no sign of active 
disease. 
2. Children exposed to active tuberculosis, particularly those of 
a marked degree of malnutrition. 
8. All definitely arrested cases of pulmonary or other forms of 
tuberculosis. 
4. Marked cases of malnutrition. 
Besides learning that pure air and comfortable temperature are 
essential for body-mind activities, we need to be reminded by the 
more recent studies of nutrition that “the human flower is, of all 
flowers, the one which has most need of sunlight.” In this con- 
nection we may well spend some time in informing ourselves as to 
the work of Doctor Rollier, of Switzeriand, who gives his pupils 
not only pure air but abundant light and bodily movement. His 
methods are having an influence in schools in other European coun- 
tries, .

THE SUMMER CAMP 
The summer-camp idea dates back some centuries, but in practice 
it has only lately had its phenomenal development. Like other 
schools, it began and chiefly remains a private institution, but it is 
made use of to an increasing degree as an adjunct of the school for 
the treatment of tuberculous or malnourished children. In the camp 
the child, during a season when he is often left too much to his own 
ill-considered ways, can be placed without thought that he is being 
schooled, under an ideal régime for health in which every condi- 
tion from the foundations of diet and rest, up, can be supervised 
while he is brought into that intimacy with nature, too much lack- 
ing in our modern life. This deserves to become a part of the expe- 
rience not only of the ailing child or the child with well-to-do 
parents but of every child and at public if not private expense. 
The cost might be considerable, but the results would be worth it. 
In 83 cities the camp has established itself as a part of the recrea- 
tional system, and it only needs to be absorbed by the schools. 
OTHER SPECIAL SCHOOLS AND CLASSES 
Besides the open-air schools and classes for those crippled consti- 
tutionally by bad feeding or chronic bacterial disease, there has been 
much progress toward special assistance for those locally crippled 
in eye, ear, heart, or limb. “Sight saving” or “sight conservation ” 
classes are being established in increasing numbers for children with 
corneal opacities, pronounced or progressive near sight, or other 
causes which greatly impair the vision. These classes are given 
an especially good light; extra large print is used; and the methods 
of training are especially adapted to these half-blind children. 
The number of children who are hard-of-hearing is large, and 
classes with appropriately adapted methods have been organized in 
many cities for those children who, because of this defect, can not 
profit as they should by the regular school activities. A study of 
best methods of selecting and training such children has recently 
been undertaken by the American Federation of Organizations for 
the Hard of Hearing in cooperation with the Bureau of Education. 
Children with speech defects are given more attention chiefly - 
through special teachers who work with the children individually 
or in small classes at special periods in the school day. They help 
also indirectly by advising the regular teacher as to general methods 
of handling these children so that they may not suffer from con- 
sciousness of their distressing ailments. In the city of Philadelphia 
10 of these special teachers are employed. 
Children with damaged hearts are given special attention in some 
of our larger cities by the establishment of special heart clinics
-P-A-G-E-259
  
HEALTH AND PHYSIQUE OF SCHOOL CHILDREN 255 
and by placing the children in special classes where their exercise 
and nutrition can be supervised. 
HEALTH EDUCATION 
Training in the practice as well as in the theory of hygiene (or 
health education, as it has been called) is widely adopted in the 
school program, and excellent progress has been made in the perfec- 
tion of methods for arousing interest and for securing results. This 
development has been powerfully stimulated by the efforts of the 
American Child Health Association, the joint committee of the Na- 
tional Education Association and the American Medical Associa- 
tion, the American Red Cross, the National Tuberculosis Association, 
the National Child Welfare Association, and other private agencies. 
Such work hinges on the attitude and degree of cooperation of the 
home, and this fact is still too much ignored. The work of health 
education has its objective beginning in the first physical examina- 
tion of the child, and the presence on that occasion of one or both 
parents should start the welding of a link of mutual understanding 
as to what the school is driving at when it attempts to improve the 
child’s daily habits. Periodic weighing and measuring of the child 
serves as a concrete reminder of his bodily being and as a peg on 
which to hang health lessons that endure. 
This work is placed, in many school systems, under the supervi- 
sion and direction of a special health teacher or of a physical director 
or nurse well grounded in these methods, and preparation in this 
subject has been introduced in teacher-training institutions. 
Besides the helps for teachers in the practical teaching of hygiene 
issued by this bureau, we would mention the reports of the con- 
ferences on health education held by the American Child Health 
Association and the report of the joint committee on health problems 
in education, issued in 1924, and entitled “ Health Education.” 
There has been increasing improvement in the methods of teach- 
ing and in the textbooks used in the elementary school. In high 
schools, however, except incidentally in connection with general 
science, biology, or civics (none of which subjects are always re- 
quired of all pupils), the matters of health are too much neglected 
for subjects of less moment save for obtaining entrance to college. 
There is a steady increase in the number of schools making some 
effort at presenting the facts connected with sex; and, though pro- 
gress in this direction seems painfully slow, there is promise that 
schoolmen are coming to the opinion that this subject is of im- 
portance and that they can transmit information on human origin 
with as much success as those to whom the precious task has hitherto 
been so generously confided. 
 
-P-A-G-E-260
  256 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1922-1924 
The teaching of practical home hygiene, the care of children and 
of the sick, has found a feothold in many schools to the great bene- 
fit of all concerned. This work has been furthered in many quarters 
through the activity of the American Red Cross. 
PHYSICAL TRAINING 
There is a most unfortunate confusion of terms and of understand- 
ing as to what is meant by physical education. Whereas in some 
school systems the words are still applied in their former broad 
meaning as covering all activities having to do principally with 
bodily development, health, and efficiency; in others they are applied 
in a limited sense to those more primitive (but none the less essen- 
tial) body-mind activities in which the larger muscles are brought 
into play with coincident exercise of underlying functions. 
Taking this subject in its narrower meaning, there has been a 
decided widening of interest in physical education in the past decade, 
brought about particularly by the war. 
The movement for physical training of children in public schools, 
which arose in Europe in the early years of the nineteenth century, — 
reached this country in due season. The systems adopted from 
Sweden and Germany were admirably adapted to fit into the routine 
order of classroom work. It was asserted and hoped that these 
exercises would counteract the effects of long sitting and of unavoid- 
able bad posture. It was not likely, however, that gymnastics 
carried on for a few minutes a day could have much developmental 
or recreative effect or any great mental or moral influence. In fact, 
the ‘time element in itself (seldom more than 15 minutes a day) 
negatived any notable influence on physical development. Neverthe- 
less, gymnastic exercises did much good, and were worth all the scant 
time and effort bestowed on them. 
Interschool athletics were pursued in many schools with consider- 
able outlay for coaching and for outfits, but this interest was be- 
stowed where it was least needed from a purely physical standpoint. 
The trend has been in late years, so far as the school curriculum 
and facilities will permit, to add to the formal gymnastic exercises 
the more natural training afforded by dancing, games, and a general 
participation in athletics. Methods of classifying elementary and 
secondary pupils for participation in sports are sought, and rewards 
of excellence in the way of badges or letters are employed to stimu- 
late interest. 
' Thirty-three States have passed laws making physical education 
a part of the school curriculum, and in all but two instances the law 
is, in effect, mandatory. Fourteen States have appointed State 
directors, and the preparation of teachers in this subject, as well as   
 
-P-A-G-E-261
  HEALTH AND PHYSIQUE OF SCHOOL CHILDREN 257 
the general organization of this work, is advancing satisfactorily 
under their direction. — 
While the content of the course in physical training is broaden- 
ing, its extent, so far as the school period is concerned, is still small. 
As a purely instructional exercise perhaps 15 or 20 minutes a day is 
adequate, but from a “study period” point of view, or rather from a 
joy-of-living, developmental, and recreative aspect, two hours a day 
is not too much. 
There is a healthy tendency for the educator to view again the 
recess period with the respect it so long deserved, and some added time 
is gained for supervised physical activity after school and on Satur- 
days with direction by special or by regular teachers. Probably the 
time is not far distant when the special teacher of physical training 
will begin his work in the afternoon and continue it after school 
hours and on Saturdays. 
The development of playgrounds and swimming pools, with super- 
vision through municipal or school authorities, has added much to 
the opportunity for physical and therefore mental and moral health 
of the school child. According to the last report of the Playground 
and Recreation Association of America, 711 cities now maintain 
playgrounds, with an expenditure of more than $20,000,000 a year 
for their upkeep and supervision. It is not sufficient that play- 
grounds should exist. They need to be in charge of well-trained 
directors. 
The value of the summer camp as a place for training in physical 
education and hygiene has been mentioned elsewhere. It is the 
ng link between school sessions and is a place for physical edu- 
cation in its fullest sense. It should be made the connecting link for 
all pupils and not simply for those who can afford the present cost 
of this experience. h 
Besides the summer camp, the Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, and Camp 
Fire organizations have been of much help in promoting physical 
and social education during vacation periods, and the work of these 
organizations is becoming more effective as its leaders are better 
trained. The Young Men’s Christian Association and Young Wo- 
men’s Christian Association remain worthy all-the-year promoters of 
physical, social, and mental health and development. 
Among the notable events along the line of the promotion of par- 
ticipation in sane physical activities has been the birth and develop- 
ment of the Women’s Division of the National Amateur Athletic 
Federation of America. The aims of this organization are to secure 
the adoption by women of those forms of athletics which seem best 
fitted for them, to have all such athletics supervised by their own 
sex, and to encourage research in this field. The division already has 
   
-P-A-G-E-262
    
258 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1922-1924 
a large membership of colleges and secondary schools throughout 
the country and promises to be a great power for good. 
SAFETY AND FIRST AID 
In addition to fire drills, the efforts to reduce the number of street 
accidents has become a fairly necessary part of the school program. 
The number of accidents from speeding vehicles has been reduced 
not only by classroom teaching but by closing certain streets for 
play and the providing of better playgrounds, with special traffic 
directors in the neighborhood of schools at the beginning and end of 
sessions. 
The teaching of rescue of the drowning and the resuscitation of 
the partially drowned has been stimulated by the American Red 
Cross. The subject of first aid has been furthered by the foregoing 
agency and by the United States Bureau of Mines, as well as inde- 
pendently by the local school nurses and other teachers. 
PRESCHOOL WORK 
Physical examinations with the purpose of finding and securing 
the cure of disease or removal of hampering defects were first car- 
ried on in this country in universities and colleges. From these 
higher institutions they filtered into the public schools, and after 50 
years it is recognized that it would be wisest to extend the privilege 
of this examination and bodily betterment to children before they 
are admitted to school. In Germany, for a number of years, chil- 
dren have been examined on entrance to school and if found mal- 
nourished or otherwise unfit are returned to their homes until they 
are in better condition for school work. In this country more fore- 
handed proceedings have been instituted in a few cities by the exami- 
nation of children previous to entry. 
The nursery school, which prior to the war flourished to some 
extent in England and Scotland under recognition by the educa- 
tional authorities, has found a foothold recently in this country. It 
is not to be confused with the day nursery, but is related on the one 
hand to this institution and on the other to the elementary schools. 
We quote from the annual report of Sir George Newman, chief 
medical officer of the English Board of Education: 
It will be generally agreed that the best place for the child under 5 years of 
age ought to be with his mother in his own home, but when the home surround- 
ings are unsatisfactory and likely to retard the physical and mentai develop- 
ment of the child a properly organized nursery school would seem to be the 
most suitable alternative. Such a school should clearly be free from the type 
of control and discipline which may be appropriate to older children. It should 
aim primarily at building up physique and fostering the mental growth of the 
children it cares for by placing them in happy, healthy surroundings where
-P-A-G-E-263
  259 HEALTH AND PHYSIQUE OF SCHOOL CHILDREN 
they will be fed, warmed, and cleansed and taught by homely methods how to 
help themselves, contract good habits, and respect the wishes and desires of 
their fellows. * * * It is generally conceded that the nursery school should 
be in charge of a specially trained, certificated teacher with less highly qualified 
assistants for nursing and attendance. 
Although the health of the child before he becomes a candidate for 
school may seem beyond the province of the school, it is of the great- 
est moment from every point of view that the grist which enters the 
educational mill should be of the highest quality which heredity will 
allow. It becomes, then, incumbent on the community of which the 
school is but a part to see that everything possible is done for the 
preschool welfare of the child. 
Besides the nursery school, there have been developed for the 
earlier care and guidance of the child and his parents, under public- 
health administration, habit clinics, infant welfare, and maternal 
welfare clinics, all of which aid in the delivery to the school of better 
material on which to exercise its very expensive machinery. 
COLLEGE HEALTH 
Attempts at putting and keeping the student in his best condition 
for school work began in higher institutions for learning. . There 
were giants in such work in those days, a third of a century ago,’and 
the health program in the college and university as carried out in a 
few schools, such as Amherst, Yale, and Harvard, have been sur- 
passed since in only a few institutions, and in a very large percentage 
it has not yet been approached. 
In the matter of exercise, however, there has been progress in 
most quarters in furnishing all students with facilities for and in the 
promotion of intramural sports, financed in part by returns from 
intercollegiate games. 
Of 182 colleges and universities of the first rank about 70 per cent 
require a medical examination of some kind at entrance. About 60 
per cent of the schools of liberal arts of these institutions require 
physical training for men, and of these, 61 per cent allow semester- 
hour credit.. In the schools for women the percentage is somewhat 
less. Systematic exercise is one usually in the first two years 
  only, but in some it is required for

phere of the college for women, but the endowment and establish- 
ment of a “course in euthenics” at Vassar is seemingly an entering 
wedge in the direction of education which has a direct bearing on 
the art of living. 
HEALTH OF TEACHERS 
The health of all workers is looked after to a very considerable 
extent, and conditions which make for the effectiveness of the 
teacher are not wholly neglected. The teacher-retirement acts of 
State and city schools have had their effect in reducing to some 
extent the anxiety necessarily felt for the future, and anxiety is 
depressing to physical and mental activities. 
Some States and cities have made wise requirements as to the 
physical condition of teachers, so that the evidently unfit will not fall 
into an occupation for which they are not well adapted. The school- 
ing in hygiene and physical training which the teacher in training is 
now receiving also improves her own health. 
The improvement in the schools as to ventilation, light, and clean- 
liness react (unintentionally) for the benefit of the health of the 
teacher, as do also her efforts at improving the health habits of her 
pupils. It is easier to work with children who, with a minimum of 
defects, are clean, well fed, well rested, and sufficiently exercised 
than with a dirty, malnourished, fatigued, restless, or listless crew. 
In providing suitable houses for the teachers in connection with 
the schools many communities have done much to conserve the ener- 
gies of the teacher and to improve her work. 
TEACHER TRAINING 
Facilities for training the grade teacher for work in hygiene and 
physical training ‘are developing slowly. In some States, notably 
Connecticut, the departments of education are putting into execu- 
tion very comprehensive courses of training beginning with physical 
examinations and the requirements that, within a given time, the 
candidates shall have their physical defects corrected. If such 
programs are carried out as planned, the teachers of a few years 
hence will constitute a strong force for improving personal and 
public health and vigor. 
There has been of late a phenomenal growth in size and number of 
schools giving professional courses in hygiene and physical educa- 
tion. Whereas 40 years ago there were but two schools giving a 
two-year course in “ gymnastics” or “ physical training” to a hand- 
ful of students, some 50 prominent universities and colleges now 
give courses in hygiene and physical education leading to a degree 
in this subject, while the number of State normal and of special 
   
-P-A-G-E-265
HEALTH AND PHYSIQUE OF SCHOOL CHILDREN 261 
schools giving such courses will bring the total of schools to more 
than 100. 
Very few school nurses have had any special preparation for 
school work, but opportunities for training in public health nursing 
are increasing in number, and school work is being included in the 
courses. Special summer courses have also been arranged for in a 
few instances. 
Courses for oral hygienists are now offered in 10 dental schools, 
and the number of these schools will be increased in the near future. 
Most physicians have had to learn the special problems of their 
school work chiefly through experience, but the trend of medical 
instruction toward preventive work is fitting them better than 
formerly for this task. The special schools in public health, which 
had their beginning in 1906, now number 12, and these are adding a 
small quota of better trained workers to the public school field. 
PARENT-TEACHER ORGANIZATIONS 
Medical inspection brought the school, of necessity, into contact 
with the home in a new way. The earlier workers in this field, how- 
ever, exhibited a strangely indifferent attitude toward those most 
interested, in that they never invited the parents to be present at the 
examination of their children. This attitude is, however, now cor- 
rected to some extent. 
The attempt at modifying the fundamental habits of the child, his 
eating, sleeping, etc., made it again apparent that we must have 
the thorough cooperation of the home. By tactful address this 
can be accomplished to an unexpected degree and with a far-reach- 
ing benefit on the home, but again the contact has usually been a 
distant one. 
The parent-teacher association, which has spread so widely, serves 
everywhere to bring the town and gown together in better under- 
standing and has stimulated and improved school work for health, 
at the same time making the home more sensible with regard to its 
obligations toward the work of the school. 
LEGISLATION 
Legislation for health work in the schools in this country may be 
said to have originated about 40 years ago in the practically uni- 
versal introduction of the teaching of physiology and hygiene with 
special reference to the effects of alcohol and narcotics. It was 
instruction in the effects of these rather than any other feature of 
hygiene that was aimed at, and the knowledge conveyed as to the 
mechanism of the human body was incidental.
-P-A-G-E-266
  962 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1922-1024 
Legislation for the physical examination of school children began 
in 1907, when Connecticut made it obligatory for the teachers to 
test the vision of pupils every three years. At present 42 States 
have passed laws on the subject. Though in many States the law 
is only permissive, the majority make it mandatory and specify a 
full examination. 
A State law making physical education a part of the curriculum 
was first passed in 1904, but up to 1915 only three States had enacted 
such legislation. The war gave a great impetus in this direction, 
and by 1924 such laws had been passed by 33 States. In all but two 
of these States the laws are mandatory in effect. Nearly half of 
them emphasize the teaching of hygiene, and many of them make 
provision for teacher training in this work. 
Although in 14 States a division of health work under a special 
director has been created in the department of education, legislation 
in other States has not led to much improvement of the chaotic con- 
dition in the field of general school health administration which 
exists the country over outside of the cities. To a certain extent 
improvement along these lines awaits the development of county or 
district health units. 
The operation of the “school hygiene districts,” authorized by law 
of 1924 in New York State, will be looked upon with interest. In 
such districts— 
a committee is created which is authorized to employ a full-time school health 
director. This committee consists of the city, village, and district superin- 
tendents of the district; the chairman of the (county) board of supervisors, 
and the sanitary supervisor, The county pays one-half of the expense, the 
State the other half. 
In New York $1,000 State aid is granted to districts that employ 
full-time medical inspectors and $700 to districts “that employ 
full-time dentists, dental hygienists, nurses, health teachers, nutri- 
tion or other experts, approved by the commissioner of education.” 
  SCHOOL HEALTH AGENCIES 
The existence of manifold agencies, public and private, working 
for the advancement of health work for the school child, evidences 
great interest in this work on the part of many persons, but at the 
same time it indicates that such work is either not fully appreciated 
by the schools or has not yet been assimilated with the mechanism 
of the school program. ‘The list of organizations which are doing 
excellent service in promoting health work in schools is a long one.

CHAPTER XTV 
GENERAL UNIVERSITY EXTENSION 
By Tuomas H. SHELBY 
Dean of Extension, University of Texas 
ContENTS.—Significance of university extension service—Extension activities—Statis- 
tical study—New lines of service, or lines having unusual development during the 
biennium—Extension practices and efforts at standardization. 
This report concerns itself with the growth and progress of general 
university extension for the biennial period 1922-1924. By general 
university extension is meant extension activities of universities and 
colleges in the fields not covered by agricultural and home economics 
extension under the Federal subsidy acts through the Federal land- 
grant colleges. 
The report makes no pretense at thoroughness. The limitations 
of time and resources for securing data render such an ambition im- 
possible. The information upon which the report is based has come 
largely from universities and colleges holding membership in the 
National University Extension Association, of which there are 41 
at- present. The reason for this limitation is the fact that in these 
institutions the work has been sufficiently standardized to enable some 
degree of comparison, and to arrive at some evaluation of the results 
in general terms. There is a further limitation to the report in the 
fact that data were not available from all the member institutions, 
though a request for such data was sent to every institution on the 
list, together with questionnaires concerning matters of special in- 
terest and importance. Duplicate requests were sent to those who 
failed to report the first time. 5 
It is believed that the data and conclusions here reported are indi- 
cative of the progress and development in this field of service. 
Probably in no other field of university work has progress been more 
notable or more significant. 
SIGNIFICANCE OF UNIVERSITY EXTENSION SERVICE 
The significance of the service is shown not only by the variety 
and comprehensiveness of the activities engaged in, but by the ever- 
increasing number of people reached through the service. When 
one considers the progress of extension of our leading institutions, 
including 31 State universities, he is led to the conclusion that before 
many decades have passed all Americans, both old and young, will 
have the advantages of university training and university service at 
263
-P-A-G-E-268
264 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1922—1924 
their very doors. Such is indeed the program and the ambition of 
general university extension. 
Is not this as it should be? We have agricultural and home 
economics extension under Federal subsidy because, in the main, it 
is desired to increase material production and to conserve resources 
in the home and on the farm—in a word, to increase the ability to 
make a living. Shall we not have equal emphasis placed on other 
vocational and industrial development through instruction given in 
class and correspondence courses in trades and professions, other 
than those covered by the extension work of the land-grant colleges, 
which are equally important in gaining a livelihood for a large 
portion of people? Should there not be even greater emphasis 
placed upon the elements of social inheritance whereby we acquire 
training for making a life, as well as for making a living? These 
aspects of education belong peculiarly to the field of general univer- 
sity extension. 
President Birge, of the University of Wisconsin, whose institution 
was not only a pioneer in general extension, but which has through 
the years continued to occupy a position of leadership in this field, 
declared significantly in 1924 that general university extension is 
essential not only for individual progress on the part of those who 
are unable to attend campus classes, but is equally important as a 
means of preventing the crystallization of social groups. To meet 
the ever-increasing demands of modern life, in the opinion of Presi- 
dent Birge, the social mind must be kept in a state of fluidity. In 
other words, people must study and read for themselves, must con- 
stantly acquire new ideas, and must constantly revise their ideals, if 
social life in a rapidly changing democracy is to go forward. 
Because of its resources of personnel, laboratories, libraries, and 
research material, the university is best equipped to render this 
service. Since general extension of knowledge is essential to social 
and economic development, and the universities are in the most 
advantageous position to extend it at a minimum of cost, they must 
furnish this service. In so far as State universities are concerned, 
probably the large expenditures of money taken from the pockets 
of the taxpayers of the State can be justified only by rendering 
service to the whole people. 
It has been appropriately stated by leaders in this field of thought 
that the functions of a modern State university should consist of 
the following: (1) The teaching of students on the campus; (2) re- 
search and the advancement of learning by its faculty; (3) the 
extension of its resources to the people of the entire Commonwealth. 
Notable progress is in evidence in the institutions of the South and 
West, where extension has found its richest fields of development 
and where State universities exist in largest numbers.
-P-A-G-E-269
  
GENERAL UNIVERSITY EXTENSION 265 
For convenience this report is divided into four parts: First, 
extension activities in different institutions; second, statistical data 
as indices of progress; third, activities that have had unusual devel- 
opment during the period covered by the report; and, fourth, move- 
ments for the standardization of extension courses. 
The data here presented were secured from two sources, as 
follows: 
1. Published reports and bulletins issued by the various extension 
divisions, sent in response to a request for such material as would 
set forth activities and indicate lines of development and progress 
during the two years covered by the report. 
2. Answers to questionnaires. 
I. EXTENSION ACTIVITIES 
Dean L. E. Reber, of the extension division in the University of 
Wisconsin, whose services in the field of extension are outstanding, 
has suggested * that extension services should be divided into formal 
instruction and informal service. By formal instruction is meant 
correspondence or home study; class instruction involving systematic 
and consecutive teaching; study group programs involving a definite 
program of study for a period of time; short courses, institutes, 
and conferences, given on the campus or in centers throughout the 
State; and radio lectures of an organized and consecutive sort. 
The aim of this type of instruction is systematic and consecutive 
teaching resulting in the permanent acquisition of a definite portion 
of knowledge. By informal service is meant service involving 
flexible methods and materials. The results are often inspirational 
and informational, but are less permanent than the results of formal 
instruction. The latter type of service is represented in our general 
university extension program by a great group of activities which 
might appropriately be styled the service line of university extension. 
A large majority of institutions place great emphasis on the 
formal side of extension work, and this service may be said to con- 
stitute the backbone of university extension. Formal instruction 
may be of both credit and noncredit types. The credit type covers 
courses given either by correspondence or class work off the campus, 
or by means of radio, which are in all essential respects equivalent 
to courses given on the campus, and with the same prerequisites that 
are enforced on the campus. Noncredit courses are given by cor- 
respondence, class work, radio lectures, study club outlines, etc., 
the aim being to educate and to give the benefits of college instruc-

  266 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1922-1924 
tion without any thought of credit in the institution. It is but fair 
to say that many of the noncredit courses are in all essential respects 
of college grade, and it is also true that many of them are much be- 
low college grade. For instance, courses for college entrance are 
often given by correspondence, and courses for teachers’ examina- 
tions are sometimes offered in this connection. Many other courses 
that meet special requirements of noncollege grade are included in 
the list. 
In the list of informal instruction and service lines, a survey of 
the literature reveals the following: Lectures, both singly and in 
series; lyceum courses; general radio broadcasting, including lec- 
tures and entertainment features; package library service; visual 
education service, including the distribution of films, slides, art col- 
lections, exhibits and stereographs (some of this material is used for 
entertainment features, but a large part of it is educational and 
informational) ; general information service, including the answer- 
ing of inquiries and questions of various groups and individuals 
throughout the State; women’s club work; conducting high-school 
debating leagues; high-school athletic associations; school and com- 
munity drama service; school and comunity music service; bulletin 
service; contests in literary and other events; school service, espe- 
cially rural service; welfare week-ends; the conducting of Good 
Roads essay contests; health service; special fair exhibits; workers’ 
education; technical service; library extension service other than 
package library service; debate and public discussion outside of, or 
in addition to, high-school service in this line; Government re- 
search or municipal reference bureau; service to women’s clubs in 
assisting in the organization and extension of activities; play and 
recreation service; community institutes; community center aids; 
surveys (economic, social, and school); short graduate medical 
courses; assistance in community organization and improvement; 
assistance in problems of rural economy and sociology; surveys, 
information, etc., on community and industrial relations; high-school 
visitation; music extension; fostering bible study in high schools; 
forestry extension service; engineering extension service; citizenship 
education ; retail salesmanship, including short courses and institutes 
on business.

In Table 1 an effort is made to set forth the various types of 
service, both formal and informal, offered by the different institu- 
tions under general heads that are typical of the service found in 
most institutions. All but seven of the institutions give correspond- 
ence courses. Of the 29 institutions listed as giving correspondence 
courses, all except one or two give college credit for such work, a 
notable exception being Columbia University. A large majority 
of them also offer correspondence courses of a noncredit grade. Of 
the 30 institutions offering class instruction, the vast majority give 
courses of this kind for credit. 
Several extension divisions give noncredit class work, among 
them, California, Columbia, Massachusetts Department of Educa- 
tion, Michigan, Minnesota, North Carolina, and Wisconsin. There 
is a well-defined tendency to give work in this connection which 
might be designated as workers’ education, or an Americanization 
program. Noteworthy examples are the University of California
-P-A-G-E-272
    268 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1922—1924 
and the Massachusetts Department of Education,‘in both of which 
organizations thousands’ of students are enrolled. This movement 
follows, somewhat, the lead of the Workers Education Movement in 
Great Britain, where tutorial classes have been organized through 
cooperation between the colleges and the labor organizations. This 
movement gives promise of splendid results in the program of adult 
education. A. notable by-product is the conclusion reached by those 
in charge of the movement in Great Britain that adults of non- 
collegiate grade can, nevertheless, profit greatly by instruction of 
collegiate grade when such instruction is properly given. 
It is interesting to note from the table that, if one takes the first 
eight lines of service, including correspondence instruction, class 
instruction, public information, and package library service, pub- 
lic lectures, visual instruction, school or community service, and 
institutes, conferences, and short courses, one has a large majority 
of the activities of the various extension divisions. The other 
activities in which we find three or more institutions participating, 
up to as many as 12, include 18 different: groups of activities. The 
number of detailed activities included in these groups is indicated 
by reference to the above list. 
II. STATISTICAL STUDY 
The list given below indicates the extent of offerings in the two 
major fields of extension service. The correspondence list carries 
48 subjects. Included in the list we find the laboratory sciences of 
anthropology, bacteriology, botany, chemistry, geology, paleon- 
tology, physics, and zoology. The effective teaching of the ele- 
mentary aspects of the physical and natural sciences is made 
possible in such institutions as Chicago and Wisconsin by providing 
small laboratories which are sent to the individual student for ex- 
perimental purposes. Extra charges for these courses cover the 
extra cost involved. Reports from these institutions indicate that 
such an arrangement is satisfactory, and that in this way standard 
work can be done. 
Offerings are more extensive in class centers, with 83 subjects listed, 
a few of which doubtless overlap.

Tables 2 to 4 give statistical data concerning correspondence study 
Table 2 shows the number of new enrollments 
and the number of individual students enrolled for each of the years 
1921 to 1924. By enrollment is meant registering for a corre- 
spondence course of unit of instruction. By number of individual 
students is meant the number of different persons enrolling for corre- 
spondence study or class center work. While data are incomplete, 
the evidence of growth both in enrollments and in number of indi- 
viduals served is conclusive. Total new enrollments reported for 
1921 and 1922 are 81,862, and for the biennial period of 1923 and 
1924 the number is 102,025. In individual students enrolled the 
numbers for the two biennial periods are 49,672 and 57,323, 
respectively.

a period of two weeks each. 
In response to the request, “‘ Please give details concerning lines 
of service that have had unusual development for the years 1923 and 
1924,” the following information was obtained: 
Visual Instruction: The University of Alabama reports that vis- 
ual instruction made rapid strides, stating, “ We obtained the ser- 
vices of a full-time expert, bought some $2,000 worth of material, 
and circulated reels of high-grade educational pictures.” The Uni- 
versity of Colorado reports that motion-picture service, slide service, 
and art prints were distributed throughout the State. In motion 
pictures, 144 reels, 41 recreational and 103 educational, were distrib- 
uted. The educational films were classified under industrial, scenic, 
historical, patriotic, and health. Seventy-one sets of stereopticon 
slides on patriotic, scenic, industrial, scientific, and general topics, 
including war slides, health, religious, etc., were distributed. There 
were 97 communities served, with a reported attendance of 65,351. 
The service was well distributed throughout the State, according to 
the report of the director of extension. 
Community Service Work: The University of Alabama reported 
that the community service work was very successful, more than 500 
lectures and addresses being delivered in the State.
-P-A-G-E-277
  
GENERAL UNIVERSITY EXTENSION 273 
Women’s Club Work: The University of Alabama reported that 
the women’s club programs furnished by the extension division were 
very widely used, more than 6,000 women being enrolled in groups in 
which programs were used. The University of Kentucky also re- 
ported unusual development in their women’s club work program. 
Workers’ Education: This phase of extension work had unusual 
development in the Universities of California and Oklahoma and in 
the Massachusetts Department of Education. In California hun- 
dreds of classes were organized, and these were attended by thousands 
of students. In addition to the class work, the extension division 
supervised a number of lectures for the benefit of workers. The Uni- 
versity of Oklahoma reported the organization of 24 classes in work- 
ers’ education, with subjects as follows: Philosophy, 6; economics, 1; 
psychology, 4; English, 5; arithmetic, 5; debating, 1; Spanish, 1; 
shorthand, 1. According to the director of extension, 366 persons 
enrolled in these classes. The work is received with great enthusi- 
asm. In addition to the class work, lecturers in workers’ education 
visited 42 communities, lecturing to 3,550 persons, and holding per- 
sonal interviews with some 1,250. The total number of persons 
served through the workers’ education program is estimated at 
5,282. In the class work special textbooks are used, and the classes 
constitute discussion groups. 'The work is for both men and women, 
and for all trades and occupations. 
The adult alien education under the supervision of the extension 
division of the Department of Education of Massachusetts, as author- 
ized by the general laws of that State about 1920, has had a steady 
_ development since it was inaugurated. The work is conducted in 
what is known as English and citizenship classes in evening schools, 
in factories, and in neighborhood classes (clubs, homes, churches, 
day classes). While reports for 1924 were not available, the 1923 
report indicates a total of 1,567 classes organized, 849 being in eve- 
ning schools, 306 in factories, and 412 in neighborhood classes. The 
work is carried on under the provisions of the law, through the co- 
operation of industrial plants and public schools, under the general 
supervision and direction of the extension division. Statistics show 
that factories in 34 cities and towns cooperated in conducting adult 
immigrant classes during the school year 1922-23, while 113 cities 
and towns operated under the provisions of the law in carrying out 
this type of education. Of these, 74 employed full-time or part-time 
directors and supervisors for this type of work. Enrollment in 
classes for adult immigrants increased from 9,030 for the first year 
after the passage of the act to 27,658 for the year 1922-23. 
Merchants’ institutes represent types of unusual activity in the 
Universities of Colorado and Kansas. In Colorado the institutes 
are held for a period of four to five days, usually under the auspices
-P-A-G-E-278
274 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1922—1924 
of the local chamber of commerce and the university extension divi- 
sion. One or more specialists are brought in for two periods a day 
for lectures and discussions. These institutes are entirely supported 
by the local merchants and those desiring to take the course. Sta- 
tistics indicate that the institutes are largely attended and are very 
fruitful in stimulating merchants to bring about better business 
conditions and closer cooperation between the farmers and the 
business interests of the town. The following is a program showing 
the topics discussed at a merchants’ institute held at Trinidad, Colo., 
November 2-6, 1925: 
Monday, November 2— 
‘9.30 a.m. “Planning for More Business.” 
7.30 p.m. “The Winning Salesman.” 
Tuesday, November 3—- 
9.30 a.m. “How to Get returns from Advertising Expendi- 
tures.” : 
730 p.m. “The Human Side of Retailing.” 
Wednesday, November 4— 
9.30 a.m. “Retail Credits and-How to Control Them.” 
Noon. “The Merchant and His Problem.” 
7.30 p.m. “ Knowing the Goods You Sell.” 
Thursday, November 5-- 
9.30 a.m. “Cost of Operating Retail Stores in Colorado.” 
Noon. “ Building a Community.” 
7.30 p.m. “Fundamentals of Business from the Personal 
Standpoint.” 
Friday, November 6— 
9.30 a.m. “ How to Write Advertising that Pulls.” 
Noon. “Teamwork for Community Development.” 
7.30 p.m. “Cashing in on Sales Opportunities.” 
The director of extension in the University of Kansas reports that 
the greatest development in any single activity of extension work 
during the year 1924-25 was in the merchants’ institutes, in which 
programs were offered in cooperation with the local commercial or- 
ganizations, ranging in length from two to five days. Speakers were 
furnished both from the university faculty and specialists from out- 
side to discuss the special problems of retail merchants and general 
problems having to do with community development. These insti- 
tutes were conducted in 12 communities, the communities in general 
bearing practically all of the expenses. The university assisted in 
only a few cases in bearing the administrative expenses. In addition 
to general lectures on salesmanship, advertising, store management, 
etc., regular courses were conducted in such special subjects as show- 
card writing, window trimming, preparing advertising copy, and 
accounting. The purpose of these courses is to provide both the  
-P-A-G-E-279
  
GENERAL UNIVERSITY EXTENSION 275 
employers and the employees in retail stores with the benefit of the 
experience of the most successful retailers throughout the country, as 
well as the information accumulated by such agencies as the Graduate 
School of Business Research of Harvard University, and many large 
commercial organizations which are conducting special investigations 
along retail lines. In addition to the merchants’ institutes, a mer- 
chants’ short course is annually held at the University of Kansas. 
Municipal research had unusual development in the University 
of Colorado. The Bureau of Government Research is headquarters 
for the Colorado Municipal League, and as such serves as a clearing 
house of information for municipal officials. Studies requiring in- 
vestigation, such as installation of bookeeping systems, efficiency 
studies of municipal departments, etc., are made for cities or civic 
organizations at cost; that is, actual necessary traveling expenses. 
Surveys and reports for State departments, counties, school districts, 
and towns and cities, covering specific problems confronting these 
organizations are made and recommendations made looking toward 
securing greater economy and efficiency in administration. Assist- 
ance in legislative drafting is also furnished. The bureau is the 
headquarters for the State Association of Commercial Organizations, 
and, as such, renders assistance to chambers of commerce and other 
commercial and civic organizations in dealing with their problems 
of organization and operation. 
Child health clinics were also a feature of progress made i in exten- 
sion in the State of Colorado. Five State organizations that engage 
in State-wide health work cooperate in these conferences and clinics, 
including the Colorado Tuberculosis Association, the State board of 
health, State dental association, Colorado child welfare bureau, and 
the bureau of community organization of the extension division. 
These conferences and clinics are held for the purpose of giving 
physical examinations to children, preferably children of pre-school 
age, and of furnishing parents of such children with information 
concerning the results of the clinics. In addition to the clinics, 
public lectures on health are given in the community in which the 
clinics are being held. 
Correspondence study work, or class center work, or both, had 
unusual development, gedording to reports from the Univer ate of 
Indiana, Missouri, North Carolina, Oregon, South Dakota, and 
Texas. 
In Indiana the number of different students enrolled in class cen- 
ters increased from 3,233 for 1921-22 to 5,406 in 1923-24, an increase 
of approximately 50 per cent during the biennium. 
The development in correspondence instruction in the University 
of Missouri has been in the general field of agriculture, including ani- 
mal husbandry, entomology, farm management, field crops, horti- 
culture, poultry husbandry, and soils. These are noncredit courses.

  276 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1922-1924 
From November 1, 1922, to October 31, 1924, figures furnished for 
Missouri show that there were 49 extension class centers and 139 
different classes conducted. There were 2,307 registrations by 2,158 
different students in these classes. University professors traveled to 
these 49 communities once or twice each week to meet the classes. 
The director reports that center classes and correspondence instruc- 
tion work doubled in size during the biennial period. 
The University of Oregon had almost 30 per cent increase in 
enrollments in correspondence study and class centers during the 
biennial period, notable growth being reported from the Portland 
center. 
The University of South Dakota reports that its correspondence 
study work has been trebled during the biennial period. 
The University of Texas has had an increase of approximately 
60 per cent in enrollments for correspondence work during the bien- 
nial period. 
Package library service had unusual development in the Universi- 
ties of Indiana, South Carolina, Kentucky, and Texas. In Indiana 
the circulation increased for the biennial period from 2,359 to 3,812. 
This service for 1923-24 was furnished to 413 communities, serving 
28,212 persons. Hundreds of modern, everyday topics of interest 
to the people were the bases of package libraries. 
The University of South Carolina, through its director of exten- 
sion, reports that in 1923-24 the package library service had its 
greatest growth, its work being shown in the following figures: Plays 
distributed, 2,414; readings, 15,018; reference books, 306; package 
libraries, 2,466; articles, 15,544; club programs, 735; reading 
courses, 62. 
The University of Kentucky reports a large increase in package 
library service and study-club programs in connection with the 
development of women’s clubs in the State in 1924. The increase in 
circulation of package libraries in the University of Texas has been 
from a little more than 10,000 in 1922 to 12,700 in 1924, an increase 
of about 30 per cent. There were 1,800 permanent package libraries 
distributed on more than 1,000 different subjects. 
Radio courses were broadcasted by the extension divisions of the 
University of Arkansas, University of Pittsburgh, University of 
Oregon, Pennsylvania State College, University of Florida, the 
Massachusetts Department of Education, and the University of 
Wisconsin. 
In 1924 the Legislature of Florida appropriated $50,000 for a 
radio broadcasting station to be placed in the University of Florida 
under the supervision of the general extension division. Of especial 
interest in this connection is a report on Massachusetts university 
extension courses given from Westinghouse Electric broadcasting 
station WBZ, as reported by Director James A. Moyer. fn the
-P-A-G-E-281
  GENERAL UNIVERSITY EXTENSION 277 
fall of 1923 Director Moyer, with Mr. Dennis A. Dooley, supervisor 
of university extension classes, saw the utility of radio for purposes 
of sound instruction, and devised a plan for broadcasting university 
lectures. It was arranged with G. H. Jaspert, director of station 
WBZ, Westinghouse Electric Co., to broadcast through that sta- 
tion. The following courses have been given: Household manage- 
ment; radio reception for amateurs; music appreciation; contem- 
porary American literature; short story writers; French lessons; 
and the making of a music lover. These courses were given largely 
by members of the faculties of universities, colleges, and public 
schools. There were from 8 to 10 lectures in each course, with 
a total of 1,636 students enrolled. An enrollment fee is charged 
each student, the purpose being to aid in defraying expenses. This 
matter was arranged in the following manner: Those who desired 
to receive mimeographed study material and to do the prescribed 
assignments of study and reading, and receive a special radio cer- 
tificate, sent an enrollment fee of $1 to the Department of Education, 
Boston. Paid enrollments have been received from Canada and 
from more than one-half of the States of the American Union. 
They came from as far west as the Rocky Mountains, and as far 
north as Newfoundland and Labrador. The director states that the 
experiment is entirely satisfactory, that the work will be continued, 
and that new courses will be planned to meet developing interests. 
Among the new courses planned to begin soon after the report was 
made are: Chief English writers of our day, French conversation 
and literature, and business psychology. The director further states 
that there are undoubtedly tremendous possibilities in this method 
of providing education for adults who want an education, and 
broadcasting courses will become a significant part of the work done 
by the Massachusetts Department of Education. 
The beginning that has been made in giving courses by radio 
indicates the possibilities for service in this direction. It is evident 
from the experiments made that lecture courses, foreign languages, 
social sciences, and other courses of a similar nature can easily be 
given by this method, which combines the lecture with written 
reports. The experience which we have had in this connection indi- 
cates that in the future the lecturer may have thousands of students 
in his classes. This type of work is not confined to universities and 
colleges. A prominent pastor of one of the Dallas (Tex.) churches 
now has more than 25,000 students enrolled in his Sunday school 
lecture class, to whom he lectures every Sunday afternoon from 
6 to 7. 
A course in real estate is offered by the correspondence study 
department of the University of Southern California, This course
-P-A-G-E-282
  278 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1922—1924 
was adopted by the State Real Estate Association; 58 classes have 
been organized to pursue the work. 
An institute of one week is held in the University of Washington 
in which graduate medical lectures by the most noted physicians of 
America and England are given for the benefit of the physicians 
of the State. In like manner a graduate nurses’ institute of intensi- 
fied advanced instruction is given for graduate nurses each year. 
The University of North Carolina offers graduate medical lectures 
in various communities of the State throughout the summer months. 
These institutes may be secured by any community in which a suffi- 
cient number of physicians desire to secure such lectures and will 
pay the necessary fee. The work is entirely self-supporting and 
the university secures for this service outstanding authorities in the 
United States. The movement has been eminently successful in 
North Carolina. 
Another type of extension service in which North Carolina has 
taken a position of leadership is the work of the Bureau of Com- 
munity Drama, working in cooperation with the Carolina Play- 
makers. The latter is an organization of students and faculty in 
the University of North Carolina. The purpose of the playmakers 
is to produce plays as a part of the work in English in the univer- 
sity, and to stimulate the development of play writing of local flavor 
throughout the State. The purpose of the Bureau of Community 
Drama is to assist communities in staging native Carolinian plays. 
Contests in playwriting and playproduction are held and State- 
wide awards made on the basis of the best production and the best 
performance. The work has proved eminently successful in that 
State. 
EXTENSION ACTIVITIES WORKING IN CLOSE COOPERATION WITH 
THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
An interesting phase of university extension development has 
been the tendency in certain quarters to work through the public 
schools, or to cooperate with them in the solution of some of their 
problems. The director of extension in the University of Virginia 
reports that “the most outstanding development in the past two 
years has been in the high-school league, which has extended its 
activities and effected its organization for the conduct of athletic 
and literary contests throughout the State.” An example of this 
type of service which has attracted considerable notice throughout 
the country is found in the University Interscholastic League 
Bureau of the division of extension of the University of Texas. The 
work is in the nature of an extension service offered to the schools 
of the State by the university. Rules and regulations governing 
the 28 different contests have been worked out, and the conduct of 
the league is in the hands of an executive committee composed of 
members of the faculty, appointed annually by the president of the
-P-A-G-E-283
  
GENERAL UNIVERSITY EXTENSION 279 
university. Schools joining the league agree to abide by the rules 
and regulations and the decisions of the executive committee in all 
matters of dispute. Member schools pay a graduated fee ranging 
from $1 to $8, depending upon the size and classification of the 
school. 
There is a county executive committee in each county, and a dis- 
trict executive committee in each of the 32 districts into which the 
counties are grouped. These committees pass on matters of eligi- 
bility with respect to their territory, conduct county and district 
meets, etc. 
The winners in the various events in the county meet represent 
the county in the district meet, and the winners in the district meets 
in general are brought to Austin in May of each year for the final 
State championship contests. The pupils are divided into various 
groups on the basis of schools and ages, and contests are held accord- 
ing to certain eligibility requirements, one of which is that a pupil 
must be a bona fide student and must be passing in at least three- 
fourths of his work before being allowed to participate in the con- 
tests. Contests are conducted in football, basket ball, track and field 
events, tennis, debate, declamation, essay-writing, music memory, 
spelling, journalism, and arithmetic. 
Each of the various contests—local, county, district—represents - 
eliminations and the selection of winners for the next higher contest. 
The winners in the State contests are given the title of cham- 
pions for the State, and are awarded suitable trophies. Approxi- 
mately 4,000 schools are annually enrolled in the league. Many 
thousands of students participate in local, county, and district meets, 
bringing to the schools hundreds of thousands of parents and stimu- 
lating an interest not only in these activities, but in the work of the 
school in general. Approximately 1,200 boys and girls are active 
participants in the final State meet. The benefits to the State in 
raising the standard of scholarship for athletes, and in stimulating 
better scholarship and educational activities in literary events, have 
been outstanding. : 
Another type of extension service in the University of Texas, 
which works directly through the public schools, is the nutrition and 
health education program. This program includes two aspects: 
(a) School-health programs are fostered through the organization 
of what is known as the Health and Happiness League. Public- 
school classes become members of this league upon the payment of a 
nominal fee, and the teachers of the classes agree to use graded 
lessons on health habits and how to form them, which are furnished 
to the teachers weekly by the bureau during the school year. (0) 
A nutrition and health education institute is held each year in 
connection with the Texas State Teachers’ Association meeting, and 
to this are brought some of the leading authorities on health educa- 
tion in the United States. The bureau also conducts conferences 
 
-P-A-G-E-284
  280 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1922-1924 
and furnishes suggestions on health habits and their formation to 
organizations and individuals throughout the State. Special lectures 
on health work are provided, and club programs on health education 
are furnished the club women through the cooperation of the pack- 
age loan library bureau. Posters and exhibit material are furnished 
to community, county, and sectional fairs throughout the State. 
A unique feature of the health program is the conducting of an 
experiment in rat feeding, which is carried on in the grades of the 
public schools under the direct supervision of a nutrition specialist 
from the university. This experiment has stimulated interest in the 
work and has been beneficial to communities in which it has been 
held. 
There is a well-marked tendency in certain extension divisions, in- 
cluding the University of Texas, to direct the activities of the visual 
instruction work in the line of service to public schools in classroom 
teaching. Films and slides of an educational nature are provided 
and are sent out to schools desiring to use them in connection with 
their class instruction. The slide service has been particularly help- 
ful in Texas, where sets of slides worked out on a given topic, with 
a view to their use in classes in geography, history, nature study, 
literature, architecture, etc., have been made available. An effort 
has been made to secure pictures of Texas wild flowers, birds, farm 
life, and shipping. Various phases of Texas industrial activities, 
points of historical interest, types of Spanish architecture, etc., 
have all furnished material for slides. Material has not only been 
furnished in this way, but an effort has been made to develop tech- 
nique for its use in the classroom. Reports indicate that the effort 
has been quite successful. 
The extension division of the University of Oklahoma reports a 
program of tests and measurements, conducted in the public schools, 
which has stimulated an interest in the test and measurement move- 
ment and a knowledge of how to use tests to advantage in the 
solution of administrative and classroom problems. 
The University of North Carolina is fostering a movement, which 
gives much promise, of furnishing from the university well-trained 
instructors in education who organize classes in the various com- 
munities of the State for the benefit of public school teachers and 
others interested in the study of education. Practical courses, which 
the teachers and administrators may use in their daily work, are 
given, and thus the most advanced thought in educational practice 
is passed directly to the teachers and school officials. A new organ- 
ization of this sort in the University of Louisiana has had encourag- 
ing success during the last year, and points the way to still greater 
service in this direction. 
The “package library service” in several States is finding its 
greatest field of usefulness through the public schools. Lists of sub-
-P-A-G-E-285
  GENERAL UNIVERSITY EXTENSION 281 
jects on which package libraries are available are sent to teachers 
of English, and from these lists subjects are assigned to pupils for 
composition work. Pupils secure the package libraries from the 
university and work out the material for the composition. Such 
service is of special benefit in those States where public libraries have 
been slow of development. 
Several extension divisions conduct school surveys and school 
studies. In some cases the study is limited to a single system of 
schools, and in others it extends to the schools of an entire county. 
The benefits to the communities studied are unquestionable. They, 
moreover, stimulate a closer study of school conditions throughout 
the State. 
IV. EXTENSION PRACTICES AND EFFORTS AT 
STANDARDIZATION 
Several studies have been made of practices throughout the country 
with respect to various aspects of extension work. The most compre- 
hensive one was the study made by a committee appointed at the 
St. Louis meeting of the National University Extension Association 
in 1923. The report of this committee was made at the meeting of 
the association in Madison, Wis., May 8-10, 1924. .The committee 
consisted of W. D. Henderson, director of extension, University of 
Michigan, chairman; J. C. Egbert, director of extension, Columbia 
University; H. F. Mallory, director of extension, University of 
Chicago; W. H. Lighty, secretary of correspondence study, Uni- 
versity of Wisconsin; and IV. W. Reynolds, director of extension, 
University of Utah. 
The full report of the committee has been published both in the 
Proceedings of the National University Extension Association, Madi- 
son, Wis., meeting of 1924, and also as a, special bulletin published 
by the National University Extension Association. Only a very brief 
summary of the report will be given here. 
The following summary is taken from the committee report: 
(a) Institutions offering extension credit cowrses.—Practically all the edu- 
cational institutions of university grade in this country now have more or less 
well-established extension divisions as a part of their regular university or- 
ganization. The notable exceptions are Princeton, Cornell, Ohio State Uni- 
versity, and the University of Illin It should be noted, however, that the 
last three institutions named have well-organized agricultural extension de- 
partments, but no extension divisions including all phases of academic uni- 
versity activities. Illinois offers a limited amount of extramural work by class 
instruction through the college of education only. 
(0) Enrollment in university extension credit cowrses——The enrollment in 
extension credit courses in the institutions enumerated in this report at the 
close of the last fiscal year was as follows: WExtension credit courses, class 
instruction, 81,550; extension credit courses, correspondence study, 37,400; 
total enrollment (nearly), 119,000. 
        
-P-A-G-E-286
282 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1922-1924 
From the figures given it is computed that, of the total extension en- 
rollment as given above, 65 per cent represents the total student enrollment; 
that is, the number of different students enrolled in university extension credit 
courses during the past fiscal year was, in round numbers, 77,000. 
(c) Eatension credit courses like or unlike residence courses.—In 29 of the 
40 institutions listed, extension credit courses are practically the same in 
character and content as are the corresponding courses offered on the campus. 
Extension credit courses differing in certain particulars from the courses 
given in residence are offered by 11 institutions. In most cases this difference 
is very slight. In general, the object of this modification is to meet certain 
peculiar local situations and special cases. It should be noted in this con- 
nection, however, that in the case of practically all institutions coming within 
this latter classification, the courses which differ in any particular from those 
listed in the regular semester, term, or summer announcement are organized in 
practically all cases with the approval of the head of the academic depart- 
ment concerned, and in a number of cases approval is required also by the dean 
of the department or other administrative officer. 
(@) Range and content of subjects offered—The data here presented re- 
veal the fact that a grand total of about 5,000 courses are offered through 
university extension. These courses include 75 different general subjects. By 
the term “general subjects” we mean department subjects, as, for example, 
economics, mathematics, philosophy, etc. 
(e) Instructors.—Twelve of the institutions listed employ as instructors in 
extension credit courses members of the resident faculty only. In the remain- 
ing 18 cases, additional instructors are employed ; that is, instructors other than 
those of the regular resident faculty. In the great majority of these cases, 
however, such nonresident or special instructors are approved and appointed 
in accordance with the usual official procedure governing the appointment of 
members of the resident staff. There are a few exceptions to this rule, 
however. 
(f) Cost of instruction—In the case of extension courses by class instruc- 
tion, 27 of the institutions giving more or less complete information as to the 
cost of instruction reported as follows: 
Number paying a fixed fee per unit of class work independent of the rank 
Of the-Mnstructora 2s oe ee ee Se ee ee 10 
Number of institutions grading the fees strictly See to the rank of 
   the instructor. 7 
Number of institutions in which variation in ‘pt pon 
the distance of the class center from the base, the need for special in- 
struction in individual cases, income from the class, and various other 
CONCIMONS. . oo Bicce soa g eae Shee eee a ee net 10 
In the case of correspondence study, a few institutions pay a fixed fee per 
course, as is done in class instruction. Others pay a definite fee per student 
per unit of credit. Most institutions, however, pay from 25 to 50 cents per 
assignment for the reading and correction of papers. 
(g) Preparation and method of conducting correspondence courses.—Corre- 
spondence study outlines are, in general, prepared by regular faculty members, 
such outlines being subject to the approval of the director of the extension 
division and of the dean of the department concerned. In general, the read- 
ing, correction, and instruction given in connection with correspondence study 
assignments are done by regularly appointed instructors who have the specific 
courses in charge. In a few cases, persons below the academic rank of instruc- 
tor are employed to read and grade papers. The appointment of such persons, 
however, is in general subject to the approval of the director of the extension 
division and the head of the department giving credit. 
 
-P-A-G-E-287
GENERAL UNIVERSITY EXTENSION 283 
(h) Income from extension credit courses.—For extension credit courses by 
class instruction the fees paid by the students vary from $2 per unit of credit 
to $15. The average fee received, as reported by 30 institutions, is $5 per 
eredit hour. 
The fees received for extension credit courses by correspondence study cover 
about the same range as in the case of class instruction. 
Of the 29 institutions reporting definitely as to the relation of income from 
extension credit courses to the total cost of conducting the same, 23 report 
that the fees received are sufficient to cover practically the cost of main- 
taining the courses, not including office overhead. 
(i) Residence requirements for graduation—In general the institutions 
listed require one year of residence work for graduation, this year in the great 
majority of cases being the senior year. 
In nearly all cases, extension courses do not count as residence courses. 
There are a few exceptions, as follows: In Indiana, a year’s work for the 
master’s degree may be taken in extension classes and counted as residence 
work; in Minnesota, extension credit courses offered in St. Paul, Minneapolis, 
and Duluth are recognized as meeting residence requirements for the B. A. 
degree; in Oregon, extension courses in the Portland center count as residence 
work; in Pittsburgh, in some special cases; in Syracuse, courses by extension 
count as residence work; in Wisconsin extension classes in the Milwaukee 
district are being developed under university administration as residence 
courses; at Yale, extension courses given under the direction of the department 
of education count as residence work. 
(j) Undergraduate credit allowed for extension credit courses—Of the 35 
institutions furnishing data, 3 report “no ruling” as to the total number of 
hours of credit which may be earned through the medium of extension credit 
courses; 9 allow one year of credit toward graduation; 11 allow two years; 
the remaining 12 institutions have set no special limit, subject to the restric- 
tion incident to the requirement of the senior year in residence and certain 
special courses which require the work to be done in residence. 
In general, students are allowed to take as many hours of extension credit 
work as they can carry satisfactorily, this last point to be determined by the 
director of the extension division in conference with the instructor in charge. 
Twelve institutions reporting do not permit students to carry extension credit 
courses while in residence. The remaining 23 institutions permit students to 
carry extension courses while in residence, provided permission is granted by 
the dean. 
(k) Graduate credit allowed for extension credit cowrses——The question of 
allowing graduate credit for work done in extension classes is subject to great 
variation. For example, Chicago allows extension credits earned by cor- 
respondence to count toward the doctor’s degree under certain specific con- 
ditions; Colorado, on the other hand, allows credit toward the master’s degree 
but not for the doctor’s degree. 
Highteen universities accept credits for graduate work under certain con- 
ditions. In general, such credits are allowed subject to the condition that 
cases be passed upon individually by the dean of the graduate school. 
(1) Attitude of universities regarding extension credits earned in other 
institutions—The University of Oklahoma accepts full credit for work done 
only through its own extension division. 
The following universities accept extension credits only when the work is 
done under the direction of regularly organized extension divisions: Columbia, 
Harvard, University of Pennsylvania, Virginia,
-P-A-G-E-288
  284 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1922—1924 
The following universities accept full credit for work done in extension 
courses. from institutions which are members of the Association of American 
Universities: Alabama, Chicago, Kansas, Missouri. 
The following universities accept extension credits from any college or 
university of “high standing”: Kentucky, Michigan, Tennessee, Washington 
State College. 
The following universities accept extension credits from those institutions 
which are members of the National University Extension Association : Colorado, 
Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, South Dakota. 
The following institutions accept no correspondence study credits: Columbia, 
Harvard, Mississippi Agricultural and Mechanical College, University of 
Pennsylvania, Virginia. 
The following universities accept extension credits that have been approved 
by the institution from which the credits are transferred: Arizona, California, 
Chicago, Kentucky, Michigan, Nebraska, North Carolina, Oregon, Tennessee, 
West Virginia, University of Washington. 
The following institutions limit the number of extension credits which they 
will accept: Chicago, 18 majors, about 60 hours; Colorado, one-fourth of re- 
quirements for B. A. degree; Kansas, 60 hours; Kentucky, 32 hours; Michi- 
gan, 15 hours; Texas, 60 hours; Washington University, St. Louis, none after 
the sophomore year. 
The following recommendations with reference to the standardi- 
zation of university extension credit courses, conducted both in class 
centers and by correspondence study, were adopted by the National 
University Extension Association at Lexington, Ky., 1922: 
(a) Character and content of extension courses.——The content of extension 
credit courses shall be practically equivalent to that of similar courses offered 
in residence. Such courses shall be approved by the head of the department 
directly concerned and such other authorities as the rules of the institution 
provide for, and also the names and numbers of such courses shall appear in 
the proper place in the general announcement. 
(b) Conditions of admission to extension courses.—Students shall be admitted 
to extension credit courses, provided that they satisfy the properofficial that they 
can pursue the courses with profit, and provided that they pay the regulation fee. 
(c) Time allotted for extension class work.—In the case of direct class in- 
struction, extension credit courses shall involve practically the same number 
of hours of class instruction as are devoted to similar classes in residence, 
and in the case of correspondence study the extension courses shall be equiva- 
lent in scope to those of the corresponding courses offered on the campus. 
(d) Examinations —wNo student shall be given credit in any extension credit 
course unless he satisfies the instructor of his mastery of the course by means 
of a thorough examination or other suitable test. 
(e) Extension instructors—aAll instructors of extension credit courses shall 
be members of the regular university faculty, or shall be appointed as nonresi- 
dent members of the faculty, their names to appear in the regular faculty list. 
(f) Credits—Students who pursue an extension credit course and who meet 
all the requirements laid down with reference to attendance, class work, and 
examinations shall be given the same credit as that given for a similar course 
conducted in residence. 
(g) Records.—In recording extension credit courses, it is suggested that 
note shall be made that such credits were earned through extension work, 
either by direct class instruction or by correspondence study.

INTRODUCTION 
Need of cooperative action for the benefit of the children is at the 
root of the movement to organize teachers and school patrons into 
working units as auxiliaries to the schools. For many years parents 
have turned their children over to the school with little thought of 
whether the children were physically fit for school life; with little 
attention to the question of habit-forming during preschool years, 
and perhaps in many cases with a sigh of relief that with the chil- 
dren’s entrance into school the responsibility for matters of morals, 
manners, and habits were to be placed in the hands of the teachers. 
Originally, organizations of parents approached the schools with 
the desire to do something to benefit them; that is, to improve 
physical conditions and to offer new opportunities by furnishing 
equipment for playgrounds, hot lunches, and school equipment 
usually furnished by the use of school funds but which for one reason 
or another were not available. All of this was good, and produced 
results of great value. Material assistance is still necessary in some 
States because of the existing conditions, and these auxiliaries to 
the schools continue to supplement inadequate appropriagions. 
But the sentiment is growing that parents may make their best 
contribution to the schools by training their children during the pre- 
school period, so that when they enter school they will be physically 
fit, mentally alert, and morally upright. Parents are already begin- 
ning to take back into the home some of the responsibilities which, 
in the past, they willingly surrendered to the schools. 
The parent-teacher associations have emphasized the necessity of 
an educated parenthood, and to accomplish this they have organ- 
ized within the associations small groups for the study of child prob- 
lems. These groups are called mothers’ study circles, preschool

study circles, reading circles, etc. The work of these circles is in 
harmony with the original purposes for which the National Congress 
of Mothers was formed in 1897. The incorporation of the parent- 
teacher association in the organization of the National Congress of 
Mothers took place when mothers discovered ‘that they could do 
their work better by close association with the teachers, and the 
further inclusion of fathers as parents interested in the welfare of 
their children brought about finally another change of name for this 
organization to include fathers and mothers as well as teachers, 
when it became the National Congress of Parents and Teachers in 
1924. 
During the biennium of 1922-1924 new and important levels have 
been reached, according to reports, in parent-teacher associations in 
respect to growth, stability of organization, efficiency’ in methods, 
responsibility in leadership, and practical results obtained. The 
gradual molding of many small groups of school patrons into an 
efficient machine capable of giving effective service to a nation is a 
task requiring patience, and one that will hardly be accomplished in 
a decade of efficient management; but this is the goal set by the 
National Congress of Parents and Teachers. 
In 1923 this organization set for itself a program which included 
an all-the-year-round parenthood; an effort to bring the things of 
the home back to the home; educating the membership and inter- 
preting the value of education to the American people. This pro- 
gram has formed the foundation of the work of not only the National 
but of State and local parent-teacher associations. 
Several types of auxiliaries to the public schools have appeared from 
time to time, emphasizing some of the needs of the schools. The 
names of these organizations have been varied, but their purposes 
have been more or less common. They are sometimes called home 
and school associations or parents’ leagues, or school improvement 
associations or leagues, or parent-teacher associations. The parent- 
teacher associations, however, have reached the stage of develop- 
ment into .a state-wide and national movement reaching every 
State and with the exception of the State of Nevada organized into 
a national group of considerable size. Nebraska, Minnesota, Okla- 
homa, Wyoming, and Louisiana associations were formed into State 
organizations during the past two years. 
Other state-wide movements, however, of some importance have 
developed to meet school needs, such as school improvement associa- 
tions which in the past accomplished excellent results for the schools 
of the Southern States and still function in Alabama, Arkansas, 
Maine, and South Carolina. Another example of state-wide organ- 
ization of school patrons is to be found in the community leagues of
-P-A-G-E-291
  PARENT-TEACHER ASSOCIATIONS AT WORK 287 
Virginia. Here and there, city-wide federations of parents or school 
patrons have supported the interests of the schools. The best 
examples of these are found in the home and school leagues of Boston 
and Philadelphia, the parents’ league of Washington, D. C., and the 
Salt Lake City (Utah) home and school leagues. 
TRAINING FOR LEADERSHIP IN PARENT-TEACHER ASSOCIATIONS 
One of the most difficult problems facing the parent-teacher move- 
ment has been that of securing persons who were willing and pre- 
pared to lead either locally or in the States. There were no courses 
on parent-teacher associations in any of the educational institutions 
until 1922, when Columbia University offered its first course. In 
1923 and 1924 this university began to offer credit courses in its 
summer sessions. This was reported to have been made possible in 
each case by the cooperation of the National Congress of Parents 
and Teachers. In 1924 a credit course was offered in the summer 
session of the University of Georgia for workers in parent-teacher 
associations. These courses were attended by superintendents of 
schools, principals, teachers, and parents who studied the problems 
of organization and development of these groups of parents and 
teachers. Radcliffe College offered a course, in 1922 and 1923, in 
the beginning course in education in which there was a treatment of 
the purposes and activities of parent-teacher associations. Students © 
in this course were required to study and report upon their own 
communities in Massachusetts. 
The demand for trained instructors to give courses in educational 
institutions was and continues to be greater than the supply, but in 
spite of this many institutions inaugurated lectures, courses, or insti- 
tutes during 1924 to develop leadership in these organizations. The 
following is an incomplete list of the institutions giving such courses 
during 1924 in some form or other: University of California (south- 
ern branch) ; University of Delaware; George Washington University, 
District of Columbia; University of Georgia; Indiana University, 
Biological Station, Winona Lake, and Fort Wayne Extension Center, 
Indiana; Chicago (Ill.) Normal College; State Normal School, Mary- 
land; Boston University; Radcliffe College; Hyannis, Fitchburg, and 
North Adams (Mass.) normal schools; Central and Northern State 
Normal Schools and Ypsilanti State Normal College, Michigan; Uni- 
versity of Minnesota and five Minnesota teachers’ colleges; Univer- 
sity of Missouri; State Teachers College, Nebraska; Newark, Ocean 
City, and Glassboro State Normal Schools, New Jersey; Columbia 
University; Bowling Green Normal College and Ohio State University; 
University of Oregon; Winthrop College, South Carolina; East Ten-

nessee and West Tennessee Normal Schools, Tennessee Polytechnic 
Institute and University of Tennessee; University of Texas and the 
seven teachers’ colleges of Texas; four State normal schools of Virginia. 
FINANCIAL WORK OF PARENT-TEACHER ASSOCIATIONS 
Parent-teacher associations take the stand generally that equip- 
ment for public schools should be provided by public funds. But 
these same organizations have met emergencies rather than to deprive 
their children of the necessary and proper means of securing an 
education. 
The almost universal attempt at retrenchment in the use of public 
funds for educational purposes during the past five years has made it 
necessary for parent-teacher associations and other similar organiza- 
tions to assume many financial burdens. The total amount raised 
and expended by these organizations has reached considerable 
proportions. 
Finance committees devise ways and means of raising funds. Ina 
thoroughly organized State like California, the finance chairman 
reports to the federation chairman, who reports to the district chair- 
man, who in turn compiles the report and submits it to the State 
chairman on finance. Even in this State complete financial state- 
ments are not available, but 12 out of 15 districts reported that they 
raised and spent, during 1924, $160,000. This amount financed 
various projects, including nutrition, scholarships, and school equip- 
ment and play equipment. Three types of organizations, local, 
State, and National, present three kinds of financing. Membership 
dues for the national organization are 5 cents per capita for members 
in each local organization; the State organizations receive a like 
amount. Local organizations may tax themselves for any amount, 
and there is a wide range in the amounts which they actually raise. 
Besides the per capita dues, the national organization of parents and 
teachers receives the income of a small endowment fund, from loan 
papers, from bequests, from the annual child welfare day contribu- 
tions, and from life memberships. 
Funds for Jocal parent-teacher associations are raised by number- 
less methods apart from the per capita dues—by salvage shops, 
bazaars, county fairs, moving-picture shows, food sales, fathers’ 
dinners, carnivals, teas, plays, candy sales, dances, card parties, 
penny drives, minstrel shows, ete. 
From the incomplete report of parent-teacher associations of 
Georgia, it appears that more than $120,000 has been raised and 
expended by the parent-teacher association for school and associ- 
ation libraries, school lunches, family service work, scholarships,
-P-A-G-E-293
PARENT-TEACHER ASSOCIATIONS AT WORK 289 
school and athletic equipment, medical inspection and _ clinics, 
scholarship loan funds, and other purposes. 
In another Southern State, Mississippi, the parent-teacher associ- 
ations are reported to have contributed during 1923-24 a total of 
over $66,000 for health programs, school and play-ground equip- 
ment, libraries, hookworm tests, student loan funds, free lunches to 
needy children, and aiding school authorities in enforcing the at- 
tendance law. 
In Delaware the organization is financed by the per capita dues, 
but it is promoted also by the Service Citizens of Delaware. During 
1923-24 nearly $18,500 was expended by the Service Citizens on the 
parent-teacher associations. 
In Virginia, two organizations serve the public schools, the Com- 
munity League of Virginia and the State parent-teacher association. 
The community league, with a reported membership in 1924 of. 
37,107, is financed by State funds, a community fund, the Laura 
Spelman Foundation, subscribers, the Virginia Tuberculosis Associ- 
ation, the Carnegie Foundation, and local league dues. The budget 
of the Virginia community leagues for a year is $26,625. Local 
leagues report that they raised $165,125 during 1924. 
SCHOLARSHIP FOUNDATIONS AND STUDENT LOAN FUNDS 
Loan funds, under several titles, have been promoted by a com- 
mittee of the National Congress of Parents and Teachers, which 
does not furnish funds but promotes the idea throughout the States, 
acting as clearing house for information on methods of procedure. 
In anumber of States student loan funds or scholarship foundations 
have been the means of keeping children in school who could not 
be maintained by their parents. Many children are kept in the 
grammar grades or the high school, and a few are sent to college or 
teacher training schools. In some organizations the children are 
required to give a note for the loan; in others no pledge is required, 
but it is expected that the loan will be paid back as soon as the 
student begins to earn. 
The California parent-teacher associations have conducted this 
work since 1923. The Kansas City (Mo.) council of parent-teacher 
associations has established a scholarship foundation which is 
financed by gifts from circles and by private contributions and by 
one-fourth of the income of the council. 
Twenty-three children were enabled to remain in school during 
1924 by the student loan fund of the Louisville (Ky.) Parent-Teacher 
League. Inaddition to the scholarships, this organization provided 
car fare to 38 children. Its budget for the year amounted to up- 
wards of $14,000.
-P-A-G-E-294
  290 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1922-1924 
Texas parent-teacher associations have accumulated a student 
loan fund of $10,000, which is handled entirely by local clubs. 
The movement in Oregon for student loan funds was started in 
1923. Tennessee State and local organizations have assisted at 
least 45 students in the university, State normal schools, high schools, 
and business colleges. 
Michigan parent-teacher associations inaugurated a student loan 
fund in 1923, which provides mothers with the same amount of 
money that a girl or boy would eern if taken out of school and put 
to work. Local organizations raise the funds, and the distribution 
is made by superintendents of schools, county commissioners, or 
other county officials. 
State organizations of parent-teacher associations in New Jersey 
Indiana, and Colorado also provide scholarship funds. In Ohio the 
student loan committee recommends that parent-teacher associations 
work through the Harmon Foundation for at least a year. 
PARENT-TEACHER MOVEMENT IN STATES 
Results of an inquiry instituted by the Massachusetts Parent- 
Teacher Association and the Massachusetts State department of 
education have been made public. It appears that 113 towns, out of 
316, reported one or more associations each and a total of 273 associa- 
tions throughout the State; 140 of them are affiliated with the State 
and National organizations. Thirty-seven towns reported organiza- 
tions of somewhat similar character, called mothers’ clubs, commu- 
nity clubs, etc. One hundred and twelve union superintendents 
consider the parent-teacher association a vital factor in promoting 
closer relationship between the school and the home; 28 replied 
favorably with qualifications, and 20 superintendents have not 
found that results have been produced; 82 superintendents depend 
upon these organizations to support programs for educational 
improvement. 
The State organization of Michigan was effected in 1918, and it 
stood third in size of membership in 1924, when it was reported that 
161 cities and towns and 97 rural communities have 521 associations, 
with a membership of 40,000. 
The Ohio Parent-Teacher organization made a gain of 11,000 
members during 1923-24, which gives to Ohio the fourth place in 
size. This increase is reported to be due to membership drives. 
Unprecedented growth is reported in Minnesota, whose member- 
ship increased 267 per cent in one year; and in West Virginia, with 
a reported increase of 255 per cent in the same year. Both of these 
State organizations came into being in 1923. In 1923-24 Illinois 
showed a gain of 98 per cent in membership.

  FIELD SERVICE 
The National Congress of Parents and Teachers employed, during 
1923-24, two full-time field secretaries and two part-time workeis, 
whose duties were to train leaders and to extend the work in districts 
which volunteer workers were unable to reach. This service was 
furnished in at least nine States. Several State associations, including 
North Carolina, Texas, Massachusetts, and Virginia, employ field 
secretaries. 
NATIONAL ORGANIZATION OF PARENT-TEACHER ASSOCIATIONS 
Thirty-three standing committees and one ‘‘bureau”’ constitute 
the machinery through which the National Congress of Parents and 
Teachers works. The standing committees are in five departments, 
which are under the general supervision of vice presidents. The 
committees have come into existence from time to time to meet 
definite needs. The committees assigned to the department of 
organization and efficiency include parent-teacher associations in 
churches, preschool circles, child welfare, child-welfare magazine, 
literature, membership, and publicity. Six committees function 
under the department of extension, parent-teacher associations in 
colleges, in high schools, in grade schools, and study circles. 
Committees on children’s reading, home economics, home educa- 
tion, social standards, standards of literature, and thrift are grouped 
under the department of home service; and under the department
-P-A-G-E-296
    
292 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1922-1924 
of public welfare are committees on American citizenship, juvenile 
protection, legislation, motion pictures, recreation, and safety. 
The department of education is made up of committees on art, 
humane education, illiteracy, kindergarten extension, music, school 
education, and students’ loan fund; and the health department 
includes child hygiene, physical education, and social hygiene. 
The resolutions adopted by an organization usually anticipate its 
future progress and program. For several years resolutions have 
been adopted by the parents and teachers on the bill to establish a 
Federal department of education, with a secretary in the Cabinet; 
the bill for Federal aid for the promotion of physical education; the 
bill to reduce the sale of drugs and narcotics; the program for peace; 
the effort to suppress the sale or distribution of salacious literature; 
the effort to secure better motion-picture films; and the wiping out of 
illiteracy. 
WORK OF COMMITTEES 
A good example of the procedure of a committee is the campaign 
to eliminate salacious literature from bookstands, which has been 
instituted by the committee on standards of literature. Three ‘‘in- 
formation forms” have been prepared and distributed. 
The first form deals with: The “glorification of the woman liber- 
tine,” in literature and on the stage; periodical literature ridiculing 
virtue and making vice attractive, which is sold at reputable book- 
stores and family drug stores; reputable dealers who do not wish 
to sell objectionable literature and will welcome some basis for dis- 
crimination; the insidious process of becoming accustomed to evil 
which has led to confusion with regard to standards of decency; 
the fact that parents are at a loss to know how to select literature 
for the family reading table; how organizations may be provided 
with bases for asking cooperation of reputable dealers; to find for 
reputable dealers a consensus of opinion on dangerous literature of 
value in shaping their policies; the aid in interpreting and enforcing 
existing laws which a survey will give public officials; the problem 
of photoplay regulation and other fields in which confusion as to 
standards of decency exists. 
The second form is addressed to parents, and 1t takes up questions 
regarding their own reading habits and the effects of certain types of 
stories upon the character. 
Two other forms contain directions for the procedure of active 
workers in the survey and a data sheet for use in judging a story. 
The parent-teacher associations. have been working on this prob- 
lem for more than three years in the interest of the morals and 
character of the boys and girls of high-school age. 
Another important movement is that of bringing representatives 
of national organizations together for counsel and advice on questions
-P-A-G-E-297
  PARENT-TEACHER, ASSOCIATIONS AT WORK 293 
of common interest. The National Congress of Parents and Teachers 
sits in the following councils, although it is not bound by the actions 
or opinions of the groups: The National American Council and the 
National Committee on Law Enforcement. It had membership on 
the (moving picture) committee on public relations, but withdrew just 
before the committee was dissolved. It has membership upon the 
committee on public relations of the National Safety Council. 
The California Parent-Teacher Association has installed a radio 
program service to its 32,000 members in Los Angeles and to the 
Berkeley membership. This new method of informing the parent- 
teacher associations has also been inaugurated in Missouri and in 
Boston, where the Massachusetts Parent-Teacher Association gives 
a 15-minute talk once a week at the Shepard Stores Radio Station. 
PARENT-TEACHER ASSOCIATIONS IN HIGH SCHOOLS 
Parent-teacher associations in high schools have become a factor 
in the solution of many of the present-day problems of high-school 
boys and girls. This is indicated by the reports of their activities 
in various States. Group action by parents has settled many diffi- 
cult questions which would have baffled individual parents, even 
when they apply to their own children. 
High-school parent-teacher associations in Illinois stress the value 
of nourishing food, more rest, less excitement, no indiscriminate 
automobile riding, no cigarette smoking, an appreciation of good 
music, of good books, and of good times at home, athletics of every 
kind for every boy and girl, hikes, glee clubs, orchestras and bands, 
dramatic clubs, neighborhood parties, and suitable dress. 
The Austin High-School Parent-Teacher association of Chicago, 
with 1,573 members, claims to have the largest membership in the 
State, including a 100 per cent teacher membership. 
At Springfield, Ill., the matter of testing the law barring secret 
societies from high schools was brought before the parent-teacher 
association in a resolution and adopted. A test case supported by 
both parents and school officials was tried in the courts. The valid- 
ity of the law was sustained. 
A high-school parent-teacher association in Spokane, Wash., 
undertook to understand the school better by use of a list of queries 
prepared by the school principal and used as the basis for the pro- 
gram of the association throughout the year. It brought to the 
attention of parents such questions as, what course their child is 
taking; whether the child is ahead or behind her grade; the equip- 
ment used for her work; the child’s interests in school aside from 
regular classes; the responsibility for moral training; actual knowl- 
edge of the library and whether the child is using it; cooperation
-P-A-G-E-298
  294 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1922-1924 
with the teacher. Parent-teacher associations are organized in 
several high schools in six cities of Washington State. 
Not only senior high schools and junior high schools nave parent- 
teacher associations in Oklahoma but also ward schools, the oppor- 
tunity school, the school for crippled children, and a “find yourself 
school.” The Oklahoma State organization has developed these 
activities within three years. 
LEGISLATION 
Since all of the interests of the fireside are affected by National and 
State legislation, it is considered by parent-teacher associations the 
duty of all parents to study bills that are introduced into State 
legislatures and into Congress. Therefore parents are urged to give 
strict attention to laws affecting child labor, education, and all 
public welfare measures. In one State the members of parent-teacher 
associations are urged definitely to study the qualifications of those 
who aspire to fill public offices in order to work for a better National, 
State, civic, and community government. Monthly bulletins of these 
organizations in some States publish a list of the bills pending in the 
legislature, with comments on the status of the bills and the action 
taken by the State board of managers for or against them. Other 
State organizations urge their members to give their assistance in 
promoting good legislation and in defeating bad legislation. 
PRESCHOOL STUDY CIRCLES, MOTHERS’,STUDY CIRCLES, AND 
READING CIRCLES 
The formation of preschool study circles, mothers’ study circles, 
and reading circies, fulfills the original purposes for which the National 
Congress of Mothers came into existence. 
Realizing the universal lack of knowledge of child training, the 
Washington State branch of the National Congress of Parents and 
Teachers promotes these circles in order to study all problems of child 
nurture prior to the school age and to promote training for mother- 
hood and home making. Among the subjects in these programs may 
be found such questions as the child as heir to the past; how the child 
impulses can be strengthened or subdued; putting good in the place 
of evil; the blighting effect of fear, ete. 
Among the States reporting that special emphasis has been placed 
upon these study or reading circles are California, Colorado, Georgia, 
Iowa, Wisconsin, and Washington. 
Sixty-one reading circles have been organized in Los Angeles 
County, Calif., in which it is stressed that the reading circle is the 
training ground for efficient membership in local associations; that 
it is a place where every mother may ask herself how nearly she 
approaches 100 per cent efficiency, and where mothers may work 
toward this end. Cooperation with the county library is one of the
-P-A-G-E-299
  
PARENT-TEACHER ASSOCIATIONS AT WORK 295 
necessities of this work. In many of the reading circles the home 
reading courses of the United States Bureau of Education are used as 
guides to the reading. Leaders are trained in these circles who go 
into districts to interest the parent-teacher membership in reading. 
Council Bluffs, Iowa, reports that 12 preschool-age circles are 
organized, and others are reported in Des Moines and Iowa City. 
Membership in these circles includes mothers of children under 6, 
expectant mothers, recently married women, engaged women, and 
others who are keenly interested as nurses, kindergarten and primary 
teachers. 
Such circles are organized in seven counties in Colorado, and nine 
new circles were started during 1923-24. In Georgia the preschool 
study circles have been active for several years, and the movement 
has grown and has proved itself valuable. The work is to be operated 
from the extension department of the State college of agriculture. 
Preschool circles have been in operation for several years in Wash- 
ington State, where it is reported that there are 35 affiliated preschool 
circles. In afew of the States training for parenthood is emphasized. 
Kansas City, Mo., has 42 active circles. 
METHODS OF READING CIRCLES 
The first large reading circle in California for mothers was organ- 
ized in Glendale, Los Angeles, by the chairman of the committee on 
education of the federation of parent-teacher associations. From 
this organization the idea spread, and there are now 61 circles in 
Los Angeles. The second largest group is in Berkeley. Methods of 
this group, as well as of the other circles, are patterned after the 
original Glendale circle. 
The aim is the enrichment of child life through the application of 
scientific knowledge of child development. Meetings are held in the 
children’s room of the public library once each week from 10 a. m. 
tolp.m. The reading is done by the same person each week, for the 
listeners grasp the meaning better when they get accustomed to the 
same voice. Handwork is carried on during the reading, and there 
are frequent interruptions for discussions and suggestions from per- 
sonal experiences from members. Each member brings her own 
light lunch, and a tea committee serves tea. The half-hour for lunch- 
eon is the opportunity for mothers to become better acquainted. 
The Berkeley circle has chosen the reading course of the United 
States Bureau of Education, No. 21, “Twenty Good Books for 
Parents,” for their reading. All books in the course are on the library 
shelves, and from two to six copies of some of the books are provided. 
By questions placed upon the blackboard, the leader outlines the 
reading taken up at each meeting, and reports on the book under 
consideration are given in response to the roll call. Reviews of

magazine articles enliven the program, and clippings of interest are 
placed upon the bulletin board. Dues of 25 cents per year are used 
to meet the expenses of the meeting, for subscriptions to the Child 
Welfare Magazine, School Life (issued by the Bureau of Education), 
and the Federation for Child Study bulletin. This is characteristic 
of the other reading circles in the State of California. 
BUREAU OF PARENT-TEACHER ASSOCIATIONS AND COOPERATION 
WITH UNIVERSITIES 
State headquarters for the parent-teacher associations of Indiana 
are established in the extension division of the Indiana University 
at Bloomington; the Indiana Parent-Teacher Association functions 
as a bureau of the extension division. A member of the staff of the 
university acts as the executive secretary, and the university in 
addition furnished clerical assistance. The extension division acts 
in an advisory capacity to the associations on questions of general 
policy and specific undertakings. 
In 1923 Tennessee parent-teacher associations affiliated with the 
University of Tennessee through its general extension service. An 
office is furnished to the North Carolina Parent-Teacher Association 
by the extension division of the North Carolina College for Women, 
at Greensboro. 
COOPERATION OF STATE DEPARTMENTS OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 
State departments of public instruction cooperate with parent- 
teacher associations by making surveys, issuing literature, by spon- 
soring lectures, and by furnishing State headquarters for the associa- 
tions. 
The office of the Texas Congress of Parents and Teachers is located 
in the State department of education at Austin, and in Massachusetts 
the university extension department of the State department of 
education cooperates with the Massachusetts Parent-Teacher Associa- 
tion by offering courses to parents on such subjects as story-telling, 
appreciation of music, music for mothers, interior home decoration, 
and child study. 
  PARENT-TEACHER ASSOCIATIONS IN CHURCHES 
The parent-teacher association has found a field of usefulnessin the | 
church. In some of the States these organizations are bringing the __ 
parents and the teachers of the Sunday schools together. 
The home and parent-teacher section of the general Sunday school 
board of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South, has issued for this 
work a general leaflet on home and parent-teacher work and another 
leaflet on the mothers’ club of the section on home and parent-teacher 
work. These leaflets are used as organization leaflets throughout the 
South.
-P-A-G-E-301
  PARENT-TEACHER ASSOCIATIONS AT WORK 297 
Organizations in churches are not confined to any one denomination, 
but reports show that they are organized in Methodist, Christian, 
Baptist, Congregational; Reformed, and Presbyterian Churches. 
The only States reporting these organizations are Connecticut, 
Illinois; Massachusetts, Mississippi, New Hampshire, New Jersey, 
and Rhode Island, but it is probable that other States have similar 
organizations. 
CONFERENCE ON HOME EDUCATION 
The second national conference on home education was called by 
the United States Commissioner of Education at the University of 
Minnesota in May, 1924, in conjunction with the annual meeting of 
the National Congress of Parents and Teachers. Librarians and 
directors of extensions, as well as leaders in parent-teacher associa- 
tions, were brought together to discuss problems of adult education of 
common interest to the whole group. ‘Thirty-three States were 
represented by a total of 80 delegates, and more than 600 people were 
in attendance. 
The program consisted of discussions on the place of the university 
extension service in a cooperative plan for the extension of educational 
opportunities; on cooperation for adult education; courses for parents; 
the library in the home education movement; how libraries educate; 
what parent-teacher associations can do for libraries; a State library 
commission conducting home reading courses; the educational 
adviser in the public library; practical methods in cooperation in 
educating for parenthood; psychic values in the home; literature in 
the home, ete. 
The outcome of this conference was the appointment of a national 
committee of seven to study the whole subject of home education. 
It consisted of two representatives each of the National Congress of 
Parents and Teachers, the National University Extension Associa- 
tion, and the American Library Association, and one member from 
the Bureau of Education. 
A report of this conference was issued by the Bureau of Education 
entitled, ‘‘Cooperation in Adult Education,’ Home Education 
Circular No. 6, 1925. 
SCHOOL-IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATIONS 
Excellent results have been accomplished by an organization of 
school patrons called ‘“school-improvement associations,’ which 
developed in the Southern States some years ago to meet a special 
need. A few States are still using these organizations as a means of 
school betterment. In Alabama the division of school and com- 
munity betterment is an integral part of the State department of 
education and is supported by State funds. At the request of the 
State parent-teacher associations, this division includes the organiza-
-P-A-G-E-302
  298 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1922-1924 
tion of parent-teacher associations in its activities. A director of 
community organization is in charge of this work and organizes 
school-improvement associations or parent-teacher associations at 
the request of local communities. 
It was reported in 1922 that Arkansas had 600 or more’school- 
improvement associations with a membership of approximately 
15,000. ‘Since that time, however, the growth and development of 
parent-teacher associations has reached the point of state-wide 
organization. 
The school-improvement league of the State of Maine was organ- 
ized in 1898 and was probably the first organization of the kind in the 
United States. It is an informal organization toward which the 
State department of education, through an agent for rural education, 
exercises informal supervision. These leagues are made up of both 
parents and children. There is no chief State executive officer, but 
-each league has its own staff of officers, whose duties are determined 
more or less by the individual school. The school-improvement 
league is a distinctly rural project in the State of Maine, for the 
larger towns and cities maintain a State parent-teacher association. 
A school community organizer, under the direction of the State 
superintendent of public instruction, organizes school-improvement 
associations in South Carolina. The work is financed by State funds 
and by the funds raised by the organizations. The purpose is to 
unite all the people of the community in the interest of school im- 
provement. Prizes have been awarded to schools making the great- 
est material improvement during each year. The prize money is 
used in school improvement. This movement has the active support 
of the South Carolina Federation of Women’s Clubs. 
Among organizations of state-wide significance, the community 
leagues of the Cooperative Education Association of Virginia repre- 
sent one of the most successful. They provide avenues of coopera- 
tion between the citizen and the official in building better community 
life in Virginia. This movement has the approval and support of the 
State department and of the governor. Its membership is 75,453, 
in 1,971 leagues, and is directed by a board made up of officials and 
citizens. Local leagues operate in the respective communities, and a 
county organization is maintained. 
The activities of these leagues show that they interest themselves 
in almost every activity in the State, including the county Sunday 
school convention, the tobacco growers association, county medical 
society, preservation of antiquities, health clinics, schools’ educa- 
tional programs, public libraries, tuberculosis clinics, home and farm 
demonstration; and it appears that every curative, preventive, and 
constructive agency in the State has been influenced by the organi- 
zation.

  PARENT-TEACHER ASSOCIATIONS ATT WORK 299 
The organization of parents and teachers in Virginia, begun in 
1920, is also recognized by State officials. Its purposes are confined 
to education and child welfare, and it is financed by per capita dues. 
RURAL PARENT-TEACHER ORGANIZATIONS 
The State of Delaware with its typically rural conditions has 
parent-teacher associations in 84 per cent of the school districts 
outside of the city of Wilmington. 
The plan used in Delaware was the basis of the demonstration in 
rural organizations in parent-teacher associations in North Dakota, 
which was initiated in 1924 by the National Congress of Parents and 
Teachers and the North Dakota Department of Public Instruction. 
It was intended to demonstrate organization and development of 
rural parent-teacher associations as an inspiration for all States. 
This State was chosen because of its typical rural conditions, with 
nearly 5,000 rural schools, and because of the sympathetic State 
educational system. 
Local agencies in North Dakota have organized whole communi- 
ties of foreign-born people into parent-teacher groups, and good 
citizenship has been thus promoted. This has been accomplished 
usually with the cooperation of the county superintendent of schools. 
In one section of the State, Sioux Indian women wearing shawls 
and moccasins organized a parent-teacher association. Not only 
Indian women, but Indian men participated in the organization. 
The majority of the 50 people attending the meeting were Indians. 
LITERATURE OF PARENT-TEACHER ASSOCIATIONS 
With the growth of parent-teacher associations a demand has 
developed for literature for programs and for printed material for 
propaganda. The Child Welfare Magazine, which is the official 
organ of the National Congress of Parents and Teachers, was for 
many years the only periodical issued for these organizations. As 
the incomes of State parent-teacher associations have increased, 
monthly bulletins have been issued. These bulletins are usually 
issued to provide a medium for the exchange of plans and results 
and an opportunity to give and receive help. 
In Michigan, it is reported that the parent-teacher bulletin was 
distributed free to more than 40,000 members. The State organi- 
zation obtained the assistance of the schools in Detroit, Ann Arbor, 
Grand Rapids, Saginaw, and Battle Creek, in printing the bulletins. 
During the past biennium an increasing number of leaflets and 
bulletins have been issued by the National and State organizations 
showing by their subjects the attempt that committees are making 
to strengthen and guide State and local committees.

REVIEW OF EDUCATIONAL LEGISLATION, 1923 AND 
1924

INTRODUCTION 
Within the two-year period covered by this review all States held 
sessions of their legislative assemblies; and in Massachusetts, Rhode 
Island, New York, New Jersey, South Carolina, and Georgia, whose 
legislatures meet annually, there were two sessions. In all there were 
passed approximately 1,400 educational measures, exclusive of acts 
of local application and ordinary appropriation bills. This shows 
an interest in public education which should be gratifying, but in 
some previous biennial periods there was considerably more school 
legislation. In the biennium 1919-20, for example, there were passed 
more than 1,600 educational acts of general application within the 
respective States where passed. 
During a period of one or two years after the close of the World 
War school legislation flourished. Out of the war had come a new 
interest in physical education and school hygiene, Americanization, 
the removal of illiteracy; in short, improvement of the school system 
all along the line; and this new interest found expression in a large 
body of constructive school legislation. But by 1921, an odd year in 
which 42 legislatures were in session, a different temper of the 
popular mind was making itself felt in State legislatures. From this 
it soon became plain that in many of the States few, if any, forward 
steps could be expected in school legislation; in fact, there was posi- 
tive fear in some quarters that the schools might suffer distinct loss, 
particularly in the matter of financial support. In most of the 
States the development of new movements during this period is 
therefore wanting; and, moreover, new or especially significant 
phases of older movements and practices are not much in evidence.

  302 BIBNNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1922-1924 
This downward turn of the curve of school legislation may meet 
- the approval of a considerable group of people, for there are con- 
siderable numbers who seem to believe that there is already too much _ 
law. The proposition that there is already too much law on the stat- 
ute books is worth brief examination in relation to school laws. It is 
one which carries some truth, but also a measure of error. In the 
sense that the laws contain too many prohibitions and restrictions, 
there is considerable truth in the proposition; but law does not 
merely prohibit or restrict; it promotes, conserves, guarantees, and 
protects. In these positive and constructive aspects of the law, 
there can hardly be an excess. Again, in the sense that statutes 
are often prolix, and characterized by duplication or needless repe- 
tition, it may be said that there is too much law; but these qualities 
relate to the style in which the statute is written rather than to the 
nature of the law itself. Still a third sense in which we possibly 
have too much law is that in some State codes or compiled statutes 
obsolete and useless provisions are left; the “dead wood” has not 
been cut away; but here again the fault is of the nature of a fault 
in style, or perhaps the code commission or other agency designated 
to codify the statutes has not been given sufficient authority to elimi- 
nate obsolete and useless provisions. 
As regards school law, therefore, it can not be admitted that there 
is too much. So long as the public school systems of States remain 
below standard, as many of them still are, there will be need for 
more and better means of improvement; and additional or better 
laws will be necessary to provide more school funds, increase the 
school term, provide a properly trained teacher for every school- 
room, and insure the attendance of every child at a school suited 
to his capacity. Until these things are accomplished, the theory 
that there is too much school law will be untenable. 
NEW SCHOOL CODES 
One of the most important educational acts that a State legisla- 
ture may pass is a complete codification of all its public-school laws, 
written as a single bill and passed as an act establishing it as the 
code of schools laws of the State. Generally speaking, the enact- 
ment of a new school code should have one or both of two purposes: 
1. To secure proper arrangement of the law and the elimination 
of inconsistencies, duplication, and the like. 
2. To embody in the new law such organic and substantive changes 
as may at the time be desirable. 
Wherever it is proposed to adopt a new school code, both of these 
purposes will suggest themselves. In some cases it will be found 
advisable to try to accomplish both, and in others, only the first men- 
tioned. To include much organic or substantive change in a pro-  
-P-A-G-E-307
EDUCATIONAL LEGISLATION 303 
posed school code will endanger its acceptance by the legislature. 
In such a case it is advisable to make of the proposed code only a 
recodification of existing laws. If nothing more than proper 
arrangement and coordination can be accomplished at one time, the 
trial is worth the effort in a number of States whose school laws have 
not been codified in recent years. 
Since 1900, 22 States have either adopted complete recodifica- 
tions of their respective bodies of school law or amended their 
laws so generally as to reach “school code” proportions. The first 
State in the list was New Jersey. The legislature of that State in 
1903 passed “An act to establish a thorough and efficient system of 
free public schools, and to provide for the maintenance, support, 
and management thereof.” Other important enactments of codes 
within this 24-year period were those of New York, Pennsylvania, 
Illinois, Délaware, West Virginia, Alabama, Texas, Oklahoma, 
Montana, and Washington. 
In the period under review three States adopted new school codes 
or bodies of school law comparable with complete codes. These were 
North Carolina and New Mexico in 1923 and Mississippi in 1924. 
The new code of North Carolina is divided into 14 “ parts,” com- 
prising 40 “ articles,” and is a complete recodification of the State’s 
school laws, except that the laws defining the powers and duties of 
the State board of education and the superintendent of public in- 
struction, which were not by it amended or revised, were not included 
in the new code. The codification therefore begins with certain 
“interpretations” and the county board of education, and thence 
proceeds through the rest of the school system. This law exempli- 
fies both of the purposes referred to above—that is, it at once rear- 
ranges the body of school law and embodies important substantive 
changes. County school organization is not materially changed; 
county boards of education are still chosen by the State legislature, 
‘and the county superintendent is appointed by the county board. 
The more important substantive changes were the revision of the 
system of county school budgets, the provision for a “ county-wide 
plan” for the consolidation of schools, the creation of “ special tax- 
ing districts” designed to facilitate consolidation, and the amend- 
ment generally of the local tax laws. The county remains the unit 
of local school administration, but cities and “special charter dis- 
tricts ” retain their former independence. 
The new school code of New Mexico, like that of North Carolina, 
is at once a rearrangement and a revision of several organic or sub- 
stantive provisions. It is marked by brevity, and in consequence 
omits some matters which other States include in their school codes. 
Some of its more noteworthy provisions are the abolishment of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-308
  304 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1922-1924 
county board of education and the substitution of the board of county 
commissioners, the provision for the appointment (after January 1, 
1925) of the county superintendent of schools by the commissioners 
acting as a county board of education, and the establishment of an 
elaborate system of school budgeting. 
Mississippi’s school code, adopted in 1924, is of the kind which is 
designed primarily as a rearrangement and proper codification of the 
existing body of school law. It contains few organic changes. 
Prior to 1924 the pamphlet of school laws published by this State 
was a mere collection of chapters of legislation passed at different 
times and of provisions relating to education as they appeared in 
the general code. The legislature of 1924 arranged this miscella- 
neous collection in a single act, with major divisions as chapters and 
minor divisions as sections, numbered consecutively, and in this 
rearranged body of law there emerged a creditable “school code,” 
particularly as regards form. 
EDUCATIONAL SURVEYS 
The educational survey has been much discussed and widely used 
in all sections of the country. In some cases there have been marked 
benefits to the schools of the State, city, or other unit surveyed; in 
other cases no very noticeable benefits have immediately resulted. 
From the standpoint of the reviewer of legislation only the State- 
wide survey is of much interest, since this is the kind of study that 
usually recommends legislation and often results in the passage of 
new laws. 
Four States provided by law in 1923 for State educational surveys, 
and one made similar provision in 1924, 
Illinois was one of the States of the first group. By act of June 
28, 1923, the Illinois Legislature created a survey commission to be 
composed of the governor, two members of the senate, two members - 
of the house of representatives, and two citizens appointed by the 
governor. This commission was authorized to investigate the entire 
educational system of the State, including school costs, the training 
of teachers, and the higher institutions, and was directed to report 
to the legislature of 1925. An appropriation of $15,000 was made. 
A concurrent resolution of the North Dakota Legislature of 1923 
authorized the governor to appoint a commission of five members to, 
be known as the “School finance and administration commission,” 
which. was directed “to make as thorough and comprehensive a study, 
investigation, and analysis of the whole problem of school finance, 
school taxation, and school administration as possible.” This survey 
was proposed in the interest of economy in the conduct of the schools,  
-P-A-G-E-309
  
EDUCATIONAL LEGISLATION 805 
and the commission was directed to report not later than September 
1, 1924. The concurrent resolution carried no appropriation. 
The Texas educational survey, a third one provided for in 1923, 
was likewise to be an investigation of the entire public-school sys- 
tem. The act provided for the appointment of a commission and for 
the employment by the commission of a survey director and staff 
of assistants to conduct the survey. The commission was directed 
to make its report on or before December 1, 1924. An appropria- 
tion of $50,000 was made to defray the expenses incurred. 
A West Virginia act, approved May 1, 1923, created a “ public 
school commission ” of seven members to be appointed by the gov- 
ernor. The commission was “to study and investigate the laws 
and conditions in this State relating to the public-school system and 
report the results of its investigations, together with its recommen- 
dations, to the next session of the legislature.” The act itself carried 
no appropriation, but in the appropriation bill the sum of $15,000 
was allowed for the expenses of the survey. 
The act of 1924 which provided for a survey was that of Missis- 
sippi. It is entitled “ An act providing for an educational survey of 
the State schools and colleges of the State of Mississippi.” A limit 
of $10,000 was placed on the cost of the survey, and it was provided 
that the expense “be paid out of the regular 1924-25 appropriations 
to the university and colleges on a percentage basis, each institution 
paying in proportion to its appropriation.” “ 
STATE DEPARTMENTS OF EDUCATION 
Two phases of State school administration have been much in 
public print in recent years, and a large body of legislation or pro- 
posed legislation has related to them. These are (1) the composi- 
tion and organization of the State board of education and (2) the 
method of choosing the chief State school officer. 
The brief statement below shows the principal facts relative to 
the composition of State boards.

-P-A-G-E-310
  306 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1922—1924 
From the practice in the several States as indicated by this state- 
ment, a reasonably well-defined standard appears. The average 
State board of education is composed of seven or eight members, a 
majority of whom are appointed and a minority of whom attain 
membership by virtue of holding other offices; the board is in whole 
or in part appointed by the governor; and terms are for 6 years 
and overlap. 
It will be seen that the practice in the States is approaching the 
standard generally accepted by authorities on school administration. 
However, there is still too much ex officio membership, and the 
method of selection has the disapproval of what is probably a con- 
siderable group of persons who believe that the State board of 
education, being a legislative body, should be chosen by the people. 
With respect to ex officio membership, it may be said that this kind of 
board tends to be displaced by one composed of non ex officio mem- 
bers chosen for their ability, integrity, and interest in education. 
The highest class of men in the State can be induced to accept a place 
on the State board of education if men of like class are placed on the 
board with them and if they see a real duty to do or function to 
perform. Ex officio membership is therefore unnecessary; and, more- 
over, members of this kind rarely function properly. The attorney 
general, secretary of state, or other State officer is concerned with 
other affairs, his interests are elsewhere, and usually he neglects his 
educational connection. 
As regards the best method of selecting the State board of educa- 
tion, it must be said that the prevailing practice at present is ap- 
pointment of the members, or a majority of them, by the governor of 
the State. Possibly there will be a growth of sentiment in favor of 
popular election when the board’s functions as a legislative body are 
better understood, but for the present, at least, the appointive board 
prevails decisively. 
Present practice in the States with respect to the manner of choos- 
ing the chief State school officer deserves some notice here. This 
officer is elected by popular vote in 32 States; he is appointed by the 
governor in 6 States and by the State board of education in 8 States. 
It will be observed that these three groups total only 46. In Idaho 
and Wyoming there is both a superintendent of public instruction 
and a State commissioner of education. In each of these cases the 
superintendent is elected by popular vote and the commissioner is 
appointed by the State board. 
The prevailing practice is election by popular vote. The prevail- 
ing opinion among authorities on the subject is that the office should 
be an appointive one. A difference, therefore, exists between theory 
and practice. Some States have displaced popular election with
-P-A-G-E-311
    EDUCATIONAL LEGISLATION 3807 
appointment, but the number is not large. In several States where 
efforts have been made to pass from the elective to the appointive 
plan the legislatures or the people themselves have rejected the 
innovation, and popular election continues. Perhaps the people 
have not yet been educated to appreciate properly coordinated school 
administrative machinery. It is.conceivable that they do not under- 
stand the legislative nature of the board and the executive nature of 
the superintendent, who should be a professional expert. A second 
probability is that the people are very loath to give up the election 
of an officer closely connected with the administration of their 
schools. Possibly it is the State board of education that should be 
elected. In city school administration the board is in most cases 
elected and in turn appoints the superintendent, and the tendency 
is toward the same in county administration. Properly organized 
State administration does not differ very much in kind. 
In the period 1923-24 the body of legislation relating to State 
departments of education was not very large. Two States, Okla- 
homa and Kentucky, provided for larger and better organized State 
education offices. An Oklahoma act of 1923 created in the depart- 
ment of education the following positions: Assistant superintendent, 
chief clerk, rural school supervisor, agricultural assistant, chief 
high-school inspector, two assistant high-school inspectors, secretary 
of the State board of education, and several stenographers’ positions 
and clerkships. 
A noteworthy act of constructive legislation was that of the Ken- 
tucky legislature of 1924. This act recognizes the State department 
of education as a department and provides that it shall include “ at 
least the following divisions”: (1) Office of superintendent, to in- 
clude an assistant superintendent and clerical force, (2) statistics, 
(8) inspection and accounting, (4) certification and examination, 
(5) rural school supervision, (6) high-school supervision, (7) negro 
education, (8) vocational education, and (9) additional depart- 
ments as the superintendent may determine and funds permit. A 
bill, which in the legislature was a companion bill, proposed to dis- 
place the present ex officio State board of education with an ap- 
pointive board of larger membership, but this failed to become a law. 
A type of legislation which has appeared in several States in 
recent years is the “administrative. code.” This is a legislative 
act which reorganizes the executive and administrative branch of 
the State government by abolishing various departments, boards, 
commissions, and offices, establishing State “departments” in their 
place, and completely codifying the administrative law of the State. 
In such a code the department of education is made coordinate with  
-P-A-G-E-312
  808 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1922-1924 
others, as, for example, the department of agriculture, banking, or 
health. Two States in 1923 passed acts of the nature of adminis-’ 
trative codes. These were Pennsylvania and Tennessee. Usually 
the department of education has not been very materially affected 
by this type of law, but has been merely set in the administrative 
code in substantially the same form in which it appears in the 
school law. 
Within the period here under consideration, important acts affect- 
- ing the State board of education were passed in Alabama and Wis- 
consin. Alabama’s board was by act of 1923 increased from 8 to 12 
in membership. The governor and State superintendent are re- 
tained as ex officio members, and the rest. of the members are to be 
appointed by the governor, one from each congressional district, of 
which there are 10. Alabama makes other educational use of its 
congressional districts, as, for example, for the maintenance of dis- 
trict secondary agricultural schools and for the appointment of 
members of the administrative boards of its higher institutions; so 
the change made in its State board of education need not be con- 
sidered radical. ; 
A Wisconsin act of 1923 abolished the State board of education 
of that State. A certain duality of control and responsibility in 
the school system of Wisconsin had existed for several years, and 
this probably entered as a consideration in the repeal here noted. 
Prior to the passage of the repealing act of 1923 there were a gen- 
eral State board of education and a board created especially for 
vocational education, and, moreover, there were both a superintend- 
ent of public schools and a secretary of the State board of education. 
The repeal abolished the general educational board and dispensed 
with its secretary. 
With respect to State superintendents, only a few acts of sec- 
ondary importance were passed in the period reviewed here. Maine 
and Tennessee changed the titles of their respective school executives 
to “commissioner of education”; and Illinois and Alabama raised 
the salaries of their superintendents, the former to $7,500 and the 
latter to $6,000. No State changed the method of choosing its chief 
State school officer. 
COUNTY SCHOOL ORGANIZATION 
With respect to the “county unit” of administration, it would 
appear that in discussions of this subject the approach to it has 
sometimes been unhappily chosen. By this it is meant that pos- 
sibly too much interest has been focused on the “unit” and the 
county administrative machinery. If the whole field of county 
participation in the provision of public schools were thoroughly
-P-A-G-E-313
  
EDUCATIONAL LEGISLATION 809 
studied, without special emphasis on the “unit” or like single phase, 
the result should prove informing. Some of the facts relative to 
this subject.are as follows: 
    
   Number of States having county school administrative boards. 21 
Number having county superintendents of schools. 39 
Number providing for assistant county superintendents or other super: 
visory assistants. 30 
Number providing for county school taxe 27 
Number in which the county has functions in school-fund apportionment_ 36 
Number authorizing counties to maintain high schools_. 25 
Number authorizing counties to maintain public libraries. 29 
Here is evidence that the county is already an important factor 
in the public-school system. And why should it not be? In the 
affairs of civil government, the county is used for various purposes. 
Elections are held and returns made, courts are convened, taxes are 
levied and collected, records are preserved, public buildings are 
provided, roads and bridges are constructed, the poor are cared 
for, the public health is safeguarded, by means of the county as 
a unit for such purposes. And notwithstanding aspersions on the 
county from some quarters, it is performing its civil functions 
about as well as other governmental units. The point therefore 
is that it can be used intelligently for school purposes. There would 
seem little reason why it can not be used as successfully for run- 
ning schools as, for example, for holding courts or administering 
health laws. 
It appears that some would make the county unit of adminis- 
tration too hard and fast; it has sometimes been urged that the 
county be made as effectually a school district as the city now is. 
But this would mean the submergence of the local community dis- 
trict. County school organization should be more flexible than 
city, so that a measure of local autonomy and local participation 
may be left to the community. 
Within the past two years several legislative acts relating to 
county school systems were passed. On the administrative side, 
the county board of education was the subject of legislation in 
six States. 
An Oregon law of 1923 requires that in a county operating as a 
county unit the county school district must be divided into five 
divisions, and that one of the five county school directors must reside 
in each of these divisions. 
The State of Texas, which already had county boards of education 
for high-school purposes, made a beginning in 1923 with the plan 
of county-unit control of all public schools. The Texas act permits 
certain counties to submit to a vote of the people the question  
-P-A-G-E-314
  
310 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1922-1924 
whether the county unit of control will be adopted. The act applies 
to any county having a population of 100,000 or more and therefore 
affects only the five most populous counties of the State. 
A Montana act of 1923 was of the nature of amendment of an 
earlier local option county unit law of that State. It sought to 
make the older law more workable. It provides against subdistrict 
trustees making expenditures in excess of their budgets, authorizes a 
1-mill county tax to create a building fund, and defines more clearly 
the duties of subdistrict trustees as well as those of the county board. 
Three other acts of 1923 affected county school administration. 
One in Tennessee extended the provisions of that State’s county unit 
law to all counties, there having been some counties to which the 
older law did not apply. The new school code of New Mexico 
abolished county boards of education and transferred their powers 
and duties to existing county boards of commissioners, which are to 
be ex officio county boards of education. The third act of this group 
was that of North Carolina. That State’s county school boards were 
not changed in composition or organization by the new school code, 
but the board’s functions in relation to the county school budget were 
materially affected. This budget is now prepared by joint action of 
the county board of education and the county commissioners, and in 
case of disagreement appeal may be taken to the superior court. 
THE COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT 
The county superintendent of schools represents the supervisory 
and executive side of the county school system. No very important 
legislation in this field was passed in either 1923 or 1924. However, 
provisions were made for higher salaries for superintendents in 
several States. Among these were Colorado, Illinois, Iowa, and 
Mississippi. 
The tendency to raise the qualifications required of county super- 
intendents was noticeable in a few States. Among these were Ala- 
bama and New Mexico in 1923 and Kentucky and Mississippi in 
1924. 
One State in 1923 passed from popular election of the county 
superintendent to appointment of this important officer by the county 
board of education. This was New Mexico. Unquestionably the 
idea of placing in this office only properly qualified and profession- 
ally trained persons is a growing one, and the kindred idea that the 
county superintendent should bear relation to a county board similar   
 
-P-A-G-E-315
  EDUCATIONAL LEGISLATION 811 
to the relation between city superintendents and their city boards is 
likewise growing, but State legislatures come slowly to abandon the 
idea that the county superintendency eis old-time county office, 
such, for example, as the office of county treasurer. 
LOCAL SCHOOL UNITS—CONSOLIDATION 
Within the two-year period 1923-24 no organic change was made 
in any State’s system of local school administration. By this it is 
meant that no State changed from the district system to the town- 
ship or from district or township to county-unit organization; nor ~ 
was any change made contrariwise. The most noteworthy legislation 
respecting local units smaller than the county was the body of legis- 
lation relating to the consolidated school. 
There would seem to be three or four reasonably well-defined 
tendencies with respect to the consolidated central school. These 
are toward the provision of more generous State subvention of this 
kind of rural school, the adoption of the “county-wide plan” for 
consolidating districts, the enlargement of the area of the consoli- 
dated unit, and better regulation of the conveyance of pupils to 
school. Several legislatures of 1923 passed acts relating to one or 
another of these phases of consolidated district organization. Since 
this kind of school district is treated elsewhere in the Biennial Sur- 
vey of Education, extended treatment is not included here. 
PUBLIC-SCHOOL SUPPORT 
There has within the past two years been no marked change in 
tendencies with respect to public-school support. A few States as 
such have shown inclination to increase their contributions to the 
schools, county taxes have remained about as formerly, and the ten- 
dency to permit the local district to levy higher rates has appeared 
in the enactments of a few States. 
Some examples of increased State participation in school support 
within the two-year period were the enactments of Pennsylvania, 
Illinois, and Oklahoma in 1923 and that of Massachusetts in 1924. 
The Pennsylvania act was of the nature of an amendment to a, 
teachers’ minimum salary law of 1921, which contained a provision 
for part payment by the State of the minimum salaries required to be 
paid. Additional aid is provided in the act of 1923 for districts of 
unusually low assessed valuation, and State subvention of pupil 
transportation is extended.
-P-A-G-E-316
  812 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1922-1924 
An Illinois act of 1923 made some increase in that State’s con- 
tribution to the schools, but it is perhaps of more interest by reason 
of the change which it made in the system of distribution of State 
school funds. Prior to 1924-25, the school year in which this act 
was put into effect, Illinois distributed its State funds on the school 
census basis, but this is now displaced by some four bases of dis- 
tribution. These bases are (1) the “teacher-school day,” which is 
a daily session of not less than 4 hours of class-time work con- 
ducted by a full-time elementary teacher with not fewer than five 
pupils of school age; (2) the teacher basis, account being taken of 
the amount of training the teacher has received; (3) aggregate days’ 
attendance of pupils; and (4) again the teacher basis, where the 
teacher is a normal-school graduate who teaches 9 school months 
in a one-rdom elementary school district. On the first of these, a flat 
sum of 70 cents each is allowed, and an additional sum ranging from 
50 cents to $2 per “teacher-school-day” is allowed districts of 
relatively low assessed valuation in inverse ratio to the valuation. 
Apportionment is made on the first-mentioned teacher basis as fol- 
lows: For 18 weeks of normal training, 50 cents per week; 36 weeks 
of normal training, $1 per week; graduate of two-year course in 
State normal school, $2.50 per week. On the third basis, 114 cents 
is apportioned for each day a pupil attends school. Fourth basis, 
$100 for each teacher of the class specified and employed as specified. 
Chapter 288 of the Oklahoma laws of 1923 proposed an amend- 
ment to the constitution of that State. It provided for a State tax 
levy on an ad valorem basis sufficient to raise a fund equal to at 
least $15 per annum for each pupil in attendance as shown by aver- 
age attendance reports. From this fund $15 per unit of average 
attendance was to be apportioned. The proposed amendment was 
ratified by the people, but was by the State supreme court later 
declared invalid on the ground of improper submission to the elec- 
torate. The same or a similar amendment will be offered in the 
legislature of 1925. 
The Massachusetts act of 1924 amends an earlier law under which 
State aid is granted to towns of relatively low assessed valuation 
in inverse ratio to the valuation. The act of 1924 raises from 
$2,500,000 to $3,000,000 the property assessment which a town may 
have and come within the class entitled to State aid for its public 
schools, 
It was said in an earlier paragraph that county taxes have re- 
mained during the past two years about as they formerly were. 
There is one exception to this general statement: Utah in 1923 
changed its system of county school taxation. In that State tax 
levies in county school districts of the first clags, which are whole
-P-A-G-E-317
EDUCATIONAL LEGISLATION 318 
counties in most cases, are now limited as follows: In a district 
with assessed valuation of $2,000 to $2,500 per child of school age, 
12 mills; in a district with valuation of $2,500 to $3,000 per child, 
10 mills; $3,000 to $4,000 per child, 814 mills; $4,000 to $5,000 per 
child, 7144 mills; more than $5,000 per child, 7 mills; but these limita- 
tions can not in any case operate to reduce a levy below that of 
1922. This would seem a more rational basis of limiting tax levies 
than limiting them in a stated flat rate, as, for example, where a 
flat rate of 10 mills is made the maximum limit for all counties or 
districts without regard to assessed valuation. 
With respect to district-school taxes, little discussion need be intro- 
duced here. Several years ago there was a marked tendency to 
increase rates of district levies both by local action and, where 
legislation was necessary to permit higher rates, by action of State 
legislatures. But in more recent years there has not been so much 
legislation on the subject. Within the period here under review, 
Ohio, Utah, Nevada, and one or two other States passed laws of some 
importance in the field of local-school taxation. 
Before the subject of school support is passed, two or three phases 
of it which have in recent years received more than ordinary notice 
both in educational circles and in State legislatures may be ad- 
verted to here. One of these is the proportion of the burden of pub- 
lic-school support which the State as such is carrying—that is, the 
proportion which the State as distinguished from the smaller units, 
county and school district, has assumed. 
The results of changes in school support in recent years are shown 
in the report entitled “Statistics of State School Systems,” pub- 
lished by the Bureau of Education. The statement is a percentage 
analysis of school funds received from taxation and appropriations 
and shows for the country as a whole the percentages received, re- 
spectively, from State, county, and local school district.

It is, of course, not contended that these figures are conclusive, but 
there is certainly evidence here that the State has not lost ground 
as a contributor to school support, but has made some slight gain. 
Such evidence should be gratifying to those who hold the view that 
the State should be relatively a larger contributor than it is. 
 
-P-A-G-E-318
  
814 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1922-1924 
Another phase of the problem of school support which has re- 
ceived more than ordinary attention in recent years is seen in vari- 
ous efforts and proposals to provide school revenues from sources 
other than the usual property tax. That “new sources of revenue ” 
must be found is the belief of various authorities on the subject. 
It is urged by many that every person having taxable ability should 
pay some kind of tax to his State, and that some system of taxation 
should be adopted to reach every form of taxable ability with justice 
to all. That is to say, that not merely a property tax should be 
levied, but, for example, also income, inheritance, corporation, fran- 
chise, “severance” or production, and possibly luxury and sales 
taxes. There is doubtless a measure of reason in this view, for 
such is the complexity of our modern economic system that forms 
of taxation supplementary to the general property tax would seem 
imperative. It is hardly fair that a farm or other real estate, easily 
reached for the purpose of a property tax, should pay its full quota 
of a levy, while other kinds of taxable ability, as, for example, vari- 
ous forms of “intangibles,” escape with little or no toll taken from 
them. 
But it is from the standpoint of school revenues that we are con- 
cerned here. With supplementary or multiple tax systems as a 
theory or a mere economic principle we are not particularly con- 
cerned. The argument for sources of revenue other than the general 
property tax is here based on the needs of the schools. The property 
tax for school purposes can hardly be said to have broken down, 
but some hold that it has become antiquated; in some sections it 
certainly appears unequal to the burden of properly supporting the. 
schools without income from other sources. There are some States 
in which twice as much money as is now expended could be expended 
on the schools without just charge of extravagance. At present the 
schools of those States are poor in quality, terms are too short, and 
many communities are still without high-school privileges. But 
already complaint of high taxes is heard. In some cases at least, 
these complaints are justifiable, for high taxes on infertile or thin 
farm lands may become practically confiscatory. Therefore other 
sources of school revenues must be found, and this is essentially a 
problem for the school men of the country. 
THE SCHOOL TERM 
The problem of the short school term ig usually a problem either 
of school revenues or of child labor on the farm. By this it is 
meant that the short term is usually due either to want of sufficient 
funds to maintain the schools for a longer period in the year or to 
parental disposition to put the children to work instead of keeping
-P-A-G-E-319
EDUCATIONAL LEGISLATION 315 
them in school. It is to correct the first-mentioned condition that 
school revenue laws are passed and systems of school support im- 
proved from time to time by State legislatures. It is to the last- 
mentioned condition that legislatures give attention when they 
pass minimum term laws. Some notice will be given here to 
legislation aimed directly at the short school term. 
A Kansas act of 1923 (ch. 181) relates specifically to the school 
term. It requires that schools be maintained not less than eight 
months within each school year. Under the provisions of this act 
any school district, which is unable, with a 10-mill levy on its tax- 
able property, to maintain its school as required receives aid from 
the State and county in an amount equal to the difference between 
its total income and the sum necessary to maintain the eight-months 
term. Of this aid the State pays three-fourths, and the county one- 
fourth. 
A Minnesota act of 1923 amended section 2796 of the general 
statutes of that State by increasing from five to seven the number 
of months of school which districts must maintain. In a com- 
panion act the distribution to a school district of the school endow- 
ment fund of the State is made contingent upon the maintenance 
of a school for seven months. 
The new school code of North Carolina provides for a six-months 
term of schools in counties and places upon the county the responsi- 
bility and expense of maintaining the schools not less than six 
months, but a State “ equalizing fund ” is provided by appropriation 
for the purpose of aiding counties of relatively low assessed valu- 
ation. 
The practice of requiring local school units to maintain school 
for not less than a specified term is almost universal in the States, 
and the tendency is constantly to make this required term longer. 
But the standard nine months’ term is a consummation to be attained 
in the future in most of the States. 
TEACHERS 
Phases of teaching service usually seen in school legislation have 
been noticeable in the legislation of the past two years, but in less 
extent than in some former periods. These phases are what are 
thought of here as the general welfare of the teacher, teacher train- 
ing and the means of giving it, and the qualifications required. 
Legislation affecting the general welfare of teachers includes 
enactments relating to salaries, tenure, and pensions. The peak of 
legislation relating to teachers’ salaries was reached several years 
ago; hence the number of laws passed on the subject within the  
-P-A-G-E-320
  316 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1922-1924 
period here considered is not large. The Legislature of Colorado 
amended an act of 1921 which was of the nature of a minimum- 
salary law and which was designed to insure a minimum pay of $75 
per month for each teacher. The amendment of 1923 regulated 
the distribution on the teacher basis of the county tax levied for the 
purpose. It provided that no school should receive county funds 
for salary payment for a longer term than 914 months, and that 
the local district must levy at least 3 mills on the dollar of its as- 
sessed valuation. A New York act of 1923 added to an earlier law 
the provision that the annual increment to the salary of a teacher in 
the kindergarten or the first eight grades shall be not less than 
$75 a year in any city of less than 50,000 population, or in any 
union free-school district employing a superintendent or maintain- 
ing an academic or high-school department. An Ohio act, also 
passed in 1923, authorized the establishment of pay-roll accounts in 
depositories in city school districts so that teachers may be paid in 
cash. 
With respect to the tenure of teachers there was no outstanding 
legislation in either 1923 or 1924. However, New Jersey amended 
in a minor particular its older law on the subject. The amendment 
requires teachers holding positions to give boards of education 60 
days’ notice of an intention to resign. Eleven States now have laws 
designed to give public-school teachers more security in their posi- 
tions after a reasonable period of probationary service. 
Pension legislation has within the past two years received more of 
the attention of legislators than either salaries or tenure. How- 
ever, few acts were passed which established pension systems where 
they had not previously existed. Laws putting new retirement plans 
into operation were passed in Maine, where a new system to be main- 
tained jointly by teachers’ assessments and State contribution and 
to provide annuities in accordance with McClintock’s tables will 
in the course of time displace the provisions of an older law; in Ala- 
bama, where the county boards of education of the three largest 
counties of the State—Jefferson, Montgomery, and Mobile—were 
authorized to create and maintain retirement funds; and in Wash- 
ington State, where a contributory system applicable to all school 
districts not having their own local retirement funds was provided. 
The application of retirement plans was made broader and extended 
to other classes of teachers, usually those in certain State institu-— 
tions or other State service, in California, Indiana, Nevada, Penn- 
sylvania, and Rhode Island. The Michigan teachers’ retirement 
system was reorganized, and in New York provision was made for 
the discontinuance of local district pensions in favor of participa- 
‘tion in the State retirement fund. On the whole, the older tendency
-P-A-G-E-321
EDUCATIONAL LEGISLATION 317 
to make retirement plans more liberal with respect to the teacher 
and to organize them on a sound actuarial basis has continued 
through the period comprehended in this study. 
THE TRAINING OF TEACHERS 
New Jersey in 1923 provided for the establishment of a new State 
normal school at Paterson and for the support and management of 
the same. In Alabama, a normal school at Daphne which had 
previously been rated a nonstandard school was by legislative act 
put on the basis of a “Class A normal school,” of which there are 
now five in the State. A Maryland act of 1924 provided $205,000 
for buildings and equipment for the new normal school previously 
located at Salisbury on the “Eastern Shore” of that State. A 
Georgia act of the same year provided for the introduction of teacher 
training in one of the State aou culm schools maintained in con- 
gressional districts. 
Teachers’ colleges, by change of name, displaced State normal 
schools in several States, and generally a four-year course of study 
was authorized in addition to the usual two-year course. In Colo- 
rado under an act of 1923 the normal school at Gunnison was de- 
signated “The Western State College of Colorado.” All State 
normal schools of Texas were changed to teachers’ colleges in 1923, 
and in the same year Utah made its normal school a department of 
the university, to be known as the “State school of education.” 
The support of teacher-training institutions continues reasonably 
liberal in spite of efforts in some quarters to cut down State appro- 
priations. A phase of the subject which by this time would seem 
to deserve more than passing notice is seen in the scholarships now 
provided in several States. In 1923 two States made provisions of 
this kind. The Delaware Legislature authorized the State board 
of education to create at the University of Delaware not to exceed 
60 scholarships of the value of $200 each and to be awarded on 
“satisfactory assurance ” that the holder will teach in the elementary 
schools for two years after graduation. The Utah Legislature 
created at the State School of Education 100 scholarships of the 
value of $25 each. The Utah scholarships exempt holders from the 
payment of a registration fee. 
TEACHERS’ QUALIFICATIONS 
This is a subject of constant legislation. The tendency is con- 
tinually to raise the qualifications required of teachers, or at least 
to eliminate certificates of the lower grades. At present the stand- 
ard which the States, by legislation and otherwise, are working 
toward is high-school graduation plus two years of normal training 
27301°—27-—_21 
 
-P-A-G-E-322
  
318 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1922-1924 
for every teacher in the elementary schools. But as yet this stand- 
ard has been attained in but few States. Within the two-year 
period considered in this review about one-third of the States passed 
laws relating to the qualifications required of teachers. These acts 
varied from unimportant amendments in some cases to complete 
revision of the State’s law on the subject in others. 
Two important aspects of certification have been noticeable in the 
legislation of recent years. One of these is a tendency to vest in 
the State department of education all authority in the granting of 
certificates and by the same measure to take this authority away 
from county superintendents, except as they may serve as agents of the 
State department. The other aspect is that seen in laws which con- 
ceive all certificates as divided into two general classes—namely, 
standard and nonstandard or “provisional.” In this classification 
the standard may, for example, represent graduation from a high 
school and two years of normal training in addition, while the non- 
standard certificate may represent all grades below the standard, 
as first, second, and third grades. In such a plan it is usually pro- 
vided that the holder of the highest grade of nonstandard certificate 
may “build” to a standard. An Indiana act of 1923 exemplities 
the first of the aspects or tendencies above mentioned, and a Kentucky 
act of 1924 exemplifies the second. 
SCHOOL ATTENDANCE 
The present status of compulsory school attendance in this country 
may be shown in outline by means of a brief statement of facts from 
attendance requirements of State laws. The statement follows: - 
Number of States fixing 7 years as the age when attendance must begin__ 28 
  Number-fixing; 8iyears for! suchiagesi2 li 01k. 2.2 2eei ee ee 20

Number fixing 16 years for such age-_----__--_-. 38 
    Number requiring attendance for full school term_. 
Number requiring attendance for less than full term_----_--__--_________ 12 
Within the past two years Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Kan- 
sas, Minnesota, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Texas, and Wyoming 
passed acts relating to school attendance. All of these were amend- 
ments of earlier laws. The Connecticut act adds to that State’s 
law the provision that a child over 14 years of age whose physical 
or mental condition is such that his attendance at school would be 
impracticable can not be compelled to attend even though his school- 
ing is deficient. The Delaware act gives justices of the peace juris- 
diction in cases of violation of the attendance requirements; in 
some States this matter of jurisdiction is one of the weak points 
in attendance laws, The Florida act authorizes the employment of 
 
-P-A-G-E-323
EDUCATIONAL LEGISLATION 319 
county superintendents of schools as attendance officers. Minnesota 
and South Dakota provided for excusing children from school for 
a brief period each week for the purpose of receiving religious 
instruction. A Rhode Island act more clearly defined delinquent 
children and provided for dealing with them. Wyoming extended 
the age limits prescribed in its laws and now requires attendance 
for the full school term between the ages of 7 and 16, unless the 
work of the eighth grade is completed. Kansas and Texas amended 
their attendance laws generally. In the former, children between 
7 and 16 years old are now required to attend school for the entire 
term; in the latter, those between 8 and 14 must attend at least 
100 days each year. 
From this brief survey of the attendance legislation of the past 
two years, it will be seen that the tendency is toward the standard 
indicated in the preceding paragraph. Without doubt the concep- 
tion is now reasonably well fixed in the American mind that children 
should be required to go to school, or, to put it in a more American 
way, should be guaranteed the opportunity of going to school, at 
least until the work of the elementary grades is done. 
PHYSICAL EDUCATION AND SCHOOL HEALTH 
This general subject falls into three parts, namely, child health 
provisions of a general nature, physical examination or medical 
inspection, and physical training. 
A Rhode Island act of 1923 concerns more than one phase of 
school health. It provides for State subvention of medical inspec- 
tion and school health work. Under its terms any town or city 
providing for the inspection of pupils by physicians or for nurse 
visitation is entitled to receive from the State one-half of its annual 
expenditure for the purpose, if the work has the approval of the 
State board of education, but not more than $250 is allowed to any 
town or city. School boards are authorized to employ school physi- 
cians and visiting nurses; and pupils, teachers, and janitors must be 
examined at least once a year. An act of the Washington Legis- 
lature of 1923 authorized any school district of the first class to 
furnish milk to public-school pupils under 14 years of age. A 
Wisconsin act of the same year provided for instruction in the 
public schools in the symptoms of disease and the proper care 
of the body. An Oregon act authorized the board of education of 
any city having a school enrollment of 25,000 or more to provide 
for dental inspection and for dental clinics and treatment of public- 
school pupils. Legislation of 1924 included a Massachusetts act, 
authorizing towns and cities to establish health camps, within or 
without the town or city limits, for underweight and undernour- 
ished children; a New York act, authorizing the State commissioner
-P-A-G-E-324
320 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1922-1994 
of education to appoint a specialist for eyes and ears; another New 
York act, authorizing the county supervisors of any county to es- 
tablish a school hygiene district and permitting union free school 
districts and city districts of less than 50,000 inhabitants to become 
part of any such county school hygiene district; and a Kentucky 
act, authorizing the establishment of playgrounds and recreation 
centers. 
Some legislation relating to the physical examination of school 
pupils has already been noticed under Rhode Island and Oregon. 
Other States which passed laws on this subject within the period 
considered here were Connecticut, Nebraska, and South Carolina. 
The Connecticut act provides that the State board of education fur- 
nish test cards and blanks for testing the eyesight of school children 
and requires that superintendents, principals, or teachers in towns 
not employing school physicians shall make the tests annually in- 
stead of triennially as formerly. Under the Nebraska act no child 
can be compelled to submit to physical examination by other than 
the teacher if the parent’s written objection to the examination has 
been delivered to the child’s teacher, but this provision can not. oper- 
ate as an exemption from the quarantine laws of the State. The 
South Carolina act requires that physical examination of pupils be 
made within the first three months of attendance each year. 
There has been directed at medical inspection laws some criticism 
which deserves a measure of notice. One criticism has been in sub- 
stance that medical inspection merely discovers the physical defect 
and does little or nothing about it after it is discovered, that it is a 
sort of Hygeian procedure which includes diagnosis without the ap- 
plication of a remedy. A few years ago there was more justice in 
this criticism of the inspection law than there is at the present time, 
for there is now more “ follow up” of the examination or inspection 
than there formerly was. With the widespread and growing prac- 
tice of employing school nurses, the development of closer relations 
between the school and the home, and the possible growth generally 
of a better appreciation of sound bodies, there has undoubtedly been 
effected a closer relation between the physical examination of the 
pupil on the one hand and constructive effort on the other to remedy 
any defect that may have been discovered. 
With respect to physical education laws, there has been some very 
noteworthy legislation within the past two years. The Legislatures 
of Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Tennessee, and South Carolina 
passed new laws on the subject. ‘The Iowa law provides that there 
must be established in all public elementary and secondary schools 
“physical education, including effective health supervision and health 
instruction of both sexes,” and requires that every pupil physically 
able shall take the prescribed course, but no child is compelled to 
 
-P-A-G-E-325
  
EDUCATIONAL LEGISLATION 321 
take the training if his parent or guardian files a written statement 
that it conflicts with his or her religious belief. The State superin- 
tendent of public instruction is authorized to prepare a manual for 
teachers, and teacher-training institutions must provide courses in 
physical education. The new Minnesota act requires physical educa- 
tion in public schools and teacher-training institutions and provides 
for a State director. The Tennessee act likewise requires physical 
education in public schools and training institutions, but makes no 
provision for a State director or supervisor of the subject. The Wis- 
consin act is not unlike that of Minnesota—that is, it requires physical 
education courses both in the public schools and in normal schools 
and provides for a State supervisor. All of the acts above men- 
tioned were passed in 1923. South Carolina passed its law in 1924. 
This law contains substantially the same provisions as that of Iowa, 
except that it has no clause exempting a child on the ground of 
parental objection. Ohio had a physical education law prior to 
1923, but in that year it revised its law generally. 
To the reviewer of school legislation, physical education laws lack 
a certain definiteness which would seem necessary to make them most 
effective. It appears that promoters in this branch of education, or 
others interested, have as yet failed to work out a well-defined pro- 
gram which has been widely accepted; hence legislation on the sub- 
ject is wanting in definite aims or objectives. However, as the laws 
provide for State directors and State supervision, better State pro- 
grams will be evolved, the States will learn one from another, and 
more definite nation-wide objectives will doubtless come to the fore. 
PHYSICALLY AND MENTALLY HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
This is a heading meant to include such unfortunate children as 
the crippled, the deaf, and the mentally backward. Laws with 
respect to these several groups are of very much the same character 
and may be considered together. In recent years there would seem 
to be a new interest in this field, or perhaps it should be called a 
tendency to change the program with respect to the physically and 
mentally handicapped. The older “institutional” plan of handling 
these groups of children is, where practicable, giving way to the 
“special class” plan maintained by local administrative units. A 
number of the States now specifically authorize local school boards 
to establish and maintain schools or classes for the deaf, the crippled, 
or the mentally retarded, and in several cases State funds are granted 
in aid of these special schools or classes. 
Only a brief enumeration of laws can be given here. With respect 
to special classes for the deaf, Massachusetts in 1923 authorized its 
State department of education to cooperate with the school commit- 
tees of not more than six towns in the establishment of classes for
-P-A-G-E-326
  é 
822 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1922-1924 
deaf pupils. A Michigan act authorized the board of education of 
any school district to provide special classes for the deaf and also for 
the blind. A Minnesota law now empowers the State commissioner 
of education to grant permission to school districts to establish and 
maintain special classes for deaf children where five or more such 
children may attend, and a State subvention of $250 per child is 
allowed. 
The Legislatures of Illinois and Michigan passed acts in 1923 au- 
thorizing local school boards to establish and maintain classes for 
crippled children, and in each case the State grants funds in aid of 
these classes. A New Jersey act of 1923 authorizes counties to par- 
ticipate in the maintenance of homes and hospitals for crippled chil- 
dren. An Oregon act of the same year directs school districts to 
create “crippled children’s instruction funds,” to be used in employ- 
ing visiting teachers for the crippled. A New York act of 1924 
provides a “teacher’s quota ”—that is, a sum from the State treasury, 
apportioned on the teacher basis—for each teacher of a special class 
for physically defective children, including the deaf, the blind, and 
the crippled. A Kentucky act of 1924 provides for special classes 
for children with defective eyesight. 
Two States in 1923 made special provisions for mentally backward 
children. A New York act authorized the State commissioner of 
education to apportion for each teacher of a special class for chil- 
dren of retarded mental development one-half of the salary paid, 
but not to exceed $1,000 per teacher. An Oregon act applies to cities 
of 10,000 inhabitants or more. It provides for the establishment of 
a department of research and guidance in any city of this group 
and for the maintenance of special classes for “educationally excep- 
tional children,” by which is meant both those who are able to 
advance more rapidly than the average child and those who may be 
retarded. 
CONCLUSION 
But for space limitation, some treatment of various other subjects 
could be introduced here. Legislative enactments with respect to 
high schools, vocational education, institutions of higher learning, 
the regulation of schoolhouse construction, and possibly some other 
subjects not treated in this review present phases of interest, but the 
field of school legislation is an extensive one, and not all legislative 
acts can be noted in a brief review of this kind. Discussion of 
several of the subjects omitted from this chapter will be found in 
other chapters of the Biennial Survey of Education.

THE CARNEGIE CORPORATION OF NEW YORK 
The Carnegie Corporation comprises two trusts, as follows: One 
for the promotion and dissemination of knowledge and understand- 
ing among the people of the United States and one for like objects 
in Canada and other British dominions. According to the report 
of President F. P. Keppel for the year ended September 30, 1924, 
the assets of the corporation on October 1, 1923, amounted to $133,- 
659,024.17, of which $124,936,274.44 constituted the value of the 
original endowment and the remainder cash and sucurities accumu- 
lated out of the income. During the year the income of the cor- 
poration was $7,397,714.18. During the year ending September 30, 
1924, the corporation expended $12,948,619.10 for educational and 
other endeavors in the United States. Of this total, $12,349,110.72 
was based on grants voted by the trustees in previous years. For 
the furtherance of knowledge and understanding in Canada and 
other British dominions the amount paid out was $89,399.29, of
-P-A-G-E-330
326 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1922-1924 
which $29,500 was based on grants voted in previous years. During 
the same period grants were voted from income of the principal 
fund amounting to $2,448,540.94, of which $1,615,599.98 was abso- 
lute and $808,940,96 was conditional. For the fund applicable else- 
where than in the United States of America the total of grants was 
$757,575.01. 
During the foregoing fiscal year the corporation made “the largest 
distribution of funds in its history and at the same time increased 
its obligations by the smallest annual sum since the year of its 
organization.” Carnegie Institute, of Pittsburgh, received $16,327,- 
376.25, of which sum $8,000,000 was paid over to the Pittsburgh

CARNEGIE FOUNDATION FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF TEACHING 
The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, in 
its report for the year ending June 30, 1924, further develops the 
foundation’s plan of insurance and annuities, through the Teachers 
Insurance and Annuity Association, and presents the current results 
of a continuous study of pension systems. During the year the 
 
-P-A-G-E-331

trustees received a total income of $1,355,193.54 for general purposes, 
in addition to $55,412.24 from the endowment of the division of edu- 
cational inquiry, $755,193.54 from the general endowment and $600,- 
000 from the Carnegie Corporation of New York on account of its 
appropriation of $600,000 a year for 10 years. The current expendi- 
tures were as follows: (a) General endowment.—Retiring allowances 
and pensions in institutions on the associated list, $1,069,315; retir- 
ing allowances and pensions granted to individuals, $95,514.84; total 
retiring allowances and pensions, $1,164,829.84. Expenses of admin- 
istration, $66,013.10; publication, $5,399.62; total, $71,412.72. (bd) 
Division of educational inquiry—General, $11,814.85; study of legal 
education, $9,185.47; study of training of teachers, $3,361.76; study 
of dental education, $3,503.85; study of intercollegiate athletics, 
$456.47; study of education in the Maritime Provinces, $575.01; 
total, $27,747.39. Grand total, $1,263,989.95. 
The list of institutions associated with the foundation was in- 
creased by the addition of George Peabody College for Teachers, on 
November 2, 1923; the University of Colorado and the University 
of British Columbia, on May 2, 1924. 
The executive committee decided— 
That war service with the United States Food Administration, the Council 
of National Defense, the Belgian Relief Commission, and Y. M. C. A. work with 
the American Expeditionary Force should be counted as professional; that in- 
voluntary discontinuance of teaching because of war conditions should not 
terminate a teacher’s expectations from the foundation; that service with for- 
eign governments, or as secretary to the governor of a State, or as city mana- 
ger could not be counted as professional, but did not terminate expectations 
from the foundation; and that teachers who are primarily professional practi- 
tioners and officers holding professional titles, but receiving no compensation 
from their universities, have no expectations from the foundation. 
Bar-admission requirements and the status of dental education are 
discussed in the report. Pension systems and pension legislation in 
this and other countries are considered at length, with emphasis on 
the activities of the National Educational Association with regard 
to teachers’ retirement, etc. A plea for optimism in education is 
made; the results of our last half-century’s progress in organized 
education are set forth; and the simplification of our “complex 
educational machine” is urged.

JEANES FUND 
The Anna T. Jeanes Fund was established for the improvement of 
negro rural schools. According to information furnished by Dr. 
James H. Dillard, president, the fund cooperated during the session 
 
-P-A-G-E-332
  328 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1922-1924 
ending June 30, 1924, with public-school superintendents in 289 
counties in 15 States. 
The 302 supervising teachers,* who are paid partly by the counties 
and partly through the Jeanes Fund, visited regularly in these coun- 
ties 9,928 country schools, making in all 41,212 visits, and raising 
for the purpose of school improvement $502,972. The total amount 
of salary paid to the supervising teachers was $252,574, of which the 
sum of $144,423 was paid by the public-school authorities and 
$108,151 through the Jeanes Fund. 
These traveling teachers, who work under the direction of the 
county superintendents, do all in their power to assist and encourage 
the rural teachers. They introduce simple home industries into the 
small country schools; give talks and lessons on sanitation, cleanli- 
ness, ete.; promote the improvement of schoolhouses and school 
grounds; and organize clubs for the betterment of the school and 
neighborhood.

JOHN F. SLATER FUND 
The following appropriations covering the year 1923-24 were 
made by the education committee of the John F. Slater Fund: + 
County training schools, $25,000; special work, $2,000; city schools, 
$2,500; Hampton Institute, $5,000; Tuskegee Institute, $5,000; pri- 
vate secondary schools, $12,500; colleges, $16,200; total, $68,800. 
Statistics showing the work of the county training schools for the 
session ending 1924 are as follows: Number of schools, 204; number 
of teachers, 1,297; pupils in high-school grades, 6,189; salaries from 
public-tax funds, $594,268; salaries through State board, $69,300; 
average amount for salaries from public funds, $2,913; amount con- 
tributed by General Education Board for building and equipment, 
$54,292. Total amount for session 1923-24 for all purposes from 
public-tax funds, $726,126. 
These county training schools are a significant feature in the work 
of negro education in the South. Sixty-six of these schools in 
1923-24 had teachers’ homes and 47 had dormitories. Nearly all 
had boarders in near-by homes. “It is becoming evident,” say the 
Proceedings and Reports for 1924, “ that these training schools will 
ultimately become high schools. A few of them have already estab- 
lished a four-year high-school course.” The schools are located in 
  
8 Including nine State supervising teachers. Five counties had two Jeanes teachers, 
and one county had three. Two teachers worked in two counties.

($2,000 being contributed by the General Education Board) were 
made to local boards of education for the promotion of industrial 
work in 26 schools, these appropriations being made “with the 
understanding that at least an equal amount should be devoted to 
this purpose from public-school funds.” 
The schools benefiting by these appropriations are located in 
Arkansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, Tennessee, and 
Texas.

PHELPS-STOKES FUND 
The Phelps-Stokes Fund, established under the will of Caroline 
Phelps Stokes, who died in 1909, was incorporated in 1911. The 
act of incorporation directs the trustees to use the income for “ the 
erection or improvement of tenement-house dwellings in New York 
City and for educational purposes in the education of negroes, both 
in Africa and the United States, North American Indians, and 
needy and deserving white students.” The capital of the fund is 
approximately $1,000,000. 
According to data furnished by Dr. Anson Phelps Stokes, presi- 
dent, the chief activity of the corporation during the biennium under 
review has been the educational survey of East Africa, made in 
cooperation with the British Colonial Office, the International Edu- 
cation Board, and foreign mission societies of Great Britain. 
A commission on education in East Africa was organized in the 
fall of 1923, with Dr. Thomas Jesse Jones, educational director of 
the Phelps-Stokes fund, as chairman. This commission had the 
active support of the British Colonial Office, which appointed Maj. 
H. Vischer, secretary of its advisory committee on education in 
Tropical Africa, to accompany it on its travels. The report of the 
commission, entitled “ Education in East Africa,” has been pub- 
lished, which in scope is similar to the report on West, South, and 
Equatorial Africa, described in the last biennial survey of the 
Bureau of Education. xs ie 
The Phelps-Stokes Fund has encouraged the visits of African 
teachers and workers to America, and some 25 or more have already 
come to see what is being done in American schools, especially in 
such institutions as Hampton and Tuskegee and the negro rural 
schools in the South.
-P-A-G-E-334
330 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1922-1924 
The fund has undertaken to make a resurvey of negro colleges 
in the United States, including all institutions which give collegiate 
and professional training of advanced character to colored students. 
The study will be made in the winter of 1925-26, in cooperation with 
the Association of Negro Colleges and other organizations. 
In addition to the support of the African education commissions 
and related activities, the Phelps-Stokes Fund has continued to 
make small appropriations (usually in amounts ranging from $200 
to $2,000) to schools and other organizations for negroes, and to 
various agencies working for improved race relations.

BARON DE HIRSCH FUND 
The Baron de Hirsch Fund was organized on March 18, 1890, 
and incorporated on February 12, 1891, under the New York mem- 
bership corporations law, for the purpose of Americanizing and 
assimilating the immigrants with the masses and teach them to be- 
come good and self-supporting citizens, and to prevent, by all proper 
means, their congregating in large cities. The endowment fund 
given by the Baron and Baroness de Hirsch amounts now to 
$3,800,000. 
The activities of the fund are as follows: (1) The promotion of 
agricultural instruction through subsidies to the National Farm 
School at Doylestown, Pa., and the granting of scholarships to 
Jewish young men at the State Institute of Applied Agriculture at 
Farmingdale, Long Island, N. Y., as well as other New York State 
agricultural schools. These are substitutes for the Baron de Hirsch 
Agricultural School, formerly maintained by the fund for many 
years at Woodbine, N. J. (2) Aid to agriculturists by way of selec- 
tion of farm lands and loans on real or chattel security through the 
Jewish Agricultural Society. (8) Baron de Hirsch Trade School, 
New York City, which offers to. Jewish young men free instruction 
in the following trades: Machinery, plumbing, electrical, sign paint- 
ing, printing, automechanics, and operating engineering. (4) Im- 
migration port work through subsidized societies located in New 
York and Baltimore. 
The fund has latterly concentrated more on trade and agricultural 
instruction and extensive aid to farmers and given up some of its 
pioneer Americanization work and charitable pecuniary aid.

EDUCATIONAL BOARDS AND FOUNDATIONS 331 
AMERICAN-SCANDINAVIAN FOUNDATION 
The American-Scandinavian Foundation was endowed in 1911 
by the late Niels Poulson, with an annual income of $20,000 or more 
“to maintain an interchange of students and teachers, and to sup- 
port other forms of educational intercourse between the United 
States and Scandinavia.” Its income from endowment is supple- 
mented by annual dues of members of the foundation and contribu- 
tions from private individuals and business houses for special 
purposes. During the past 13 years the foundation has awarded 
stipends to 350 students. From 1919 to 1925 it has conducted an 
annual exchange of 20 American, 10 Swedish, 5 Norwegian, and 5 
Danish students, awarding to each of these a stipend of $1,000. 
Beginning with the year 1925 there was incorporated a new student 
program of industrial apprentice fellowships, which will bring to 
the United States a number of Scandinavian students for practical 
studies in American industries. 5

AMERICAN FIELD SERVICE FELLOWSHIPS FOR FRENCH 
UNIVERSITIES 
The American Field Service Fellowships for French Universities 
is administered by the Institute of International Education, with 
headquarters in New York City. Its purpose is to endow fellow- 
ships for American students in French universities; to increase 
appreciation of French learning; to secure an occasional fellowship 
in America for a French student; and to foster international under-

The Kahn Foundation for the foreign travel of American teachers 
was organized in New York City on January 6, 1911. The founder 
was Albert Kahn, of Paris. The essential object of the foundation 
is “to enable men of proved intellectual attainments to enjoy, during 
one year or more, sufficient leisure and freedom from all professional 
pursuits or preoccupations and to enter into personal contact with 
men and countries they might otherwise never have known.” The 
stipend of the single Kahn fellowship-awarded for the year 1925-26 
was $5,000.

The child health demonstrations in Fargo, N. Dak., completed its 
second year on December 31; those in Athens, Ga., and Ruther- 
ford County, Tenn., were begun in January, 1924. The fourth and 
last of these demonstrations was made in Marion County, Oreg., on 
February 1, 1925. Work in child guidance and demonstrations of 
visiting teachers were carried on in various cities. Support was 
voted to the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia Uni- 
versity toward the training of psychiatrists and two fellowships of 
$3,500 were maintained “in connection with the demonstration 
clinics operated by the national committee for mental. hygiene, for 
psychiatrists who wish to secure practical experience in child- 
guidance work.” 
Nineteen grants, totaling $293,106.03, were approved by the board, 
8 of which were for projects relating to child welfare and 11 for a 
variety of purposes.

ENGINEERING-ECONOMICS FOUNDATION 
The Engineering-Economics Foundation is “a research foundation 
established on university principles.” It is a private institution, 
supported by private funds, and is in contact with universities, 
research foundations, professional schools and colleges, both in the 
United States and foreign countries. 
To quote from one of its publications: 
The foundation works in the field, where the men are engaged in the actual 
personal problems of their daily work, not in academic halls, where men are 
concerned with the problems of preparing for practice. In other words, the 
foundation is decentralized, not centralized. It works in three divisions: 
(1) The civilian staff college division; (2) the division of industrial staff edu- 
cation; (3) the extension division. 
Staff education, as provided by the foundation, is concerned with providing, 
in advance of emergency, the only insurance which will give protection against 
confusion in emergency—that, in this case, is the organized knowledge and 
skill required to carry on civilian (nonmilitary) staff work of direction and 
plan in time of emergency, be it national emergency—fire, flood, earthquake, 
tornado, pestilence, famine, war, or economic emergency—defined as dislocation 
of the normal processes of supply and demand.

CHAPTER XVIII 
WORK OF THE BUREAU OF EDUCATION FOR THE 
NATIVES OF ALASKA 
By WittiaM HAMILTON 
Assistant Chief, Alaska Division, Bureau of Education 
ConTEnts.—Introduction—Medical relief—Industrial education—Reindeer service—Trans- 
portation of appointees and supplies. 
INTRODUCTION 
Through its Alaska division the Bureau of Education is re- 
quired to make provision for the education of the natives of Alaska, 
extend to them all possible medical relief, train them to self-sup- 
port, and, so far as possible, relieve worthy cases of destitution. 
The work is under the supervision of the chief of the Alaska 
division, with headquarters in Seattle, Wash., which is more readily 
accessible from all parts of Alaska than is any point within Alaska 
itself. The Seattle office functions as a purchasing and disbursing 
agent for all of the bureau’s activities in Alaska; it selects and 
recommends to the Commissioner of Education for appointment 
all of the bureau’s employees in Alaska; it expends or invests, as 
requested, funds sent to it by employees in Alaska, by the coopera- 
tive stores of the natives, or by individual natives of Alaska; it 
also sells commodities, such as furs, ivory, and reindeer meat, for 
the natives and remits, deposits, or expends the proceeds as directed. 
The field force in Alaska during the fiscal year ended June 30, 
1924, included 1 superintendent of education of natives of Alaska, 
with duties of a general supervisory character, 5 district superin- 
tendents, 151 teachers, 8 physicians, 21 nurses, 12 hospital attendants, 
and 8 herders in charge of reindeer belonging to the Government. 
Eighty-three schools were in operation, with an enrollment of 
3,910. The teachers not only carried on the educational work in 
the schoolrooms, but, in many instances, were responsible for the 
relief of destitution, for the extending of medical aid.to natives in 
the vicinity of the school, and for the supervising of the industries 
and of the reindeer herds tributary to the school. 
The bureau’s work was carried on in 116 buildings, including 
school buildings, teachers’ residences, hospitals, and orphanages, 
valued at $273,550.

MEDICAL RELIEF 
In its endeavor to afford medical relief and to safeguard the 
health of the native races of Alaska, the Bureau of Education 
maintains hospitals at Juneau, Kanakanak, Akiak, Nulato, and 
Noorvik, which are important centers of native population in south- 
ern, western, central, and Arctic Alaska, separated from each other 
by many hundreds of miles. : 
The hospitals, physicians, and nurses serve only the thickly popu- 
lated districts. In the outlying areas the teachers must, of necessity, 
extend medical aid to the best of their ability. Accordingly, the 
teachers in settlements where the services of a physician or nurse 
are not available are supplied with household remedies and instruc- 
tions for their use. Each hospital is a center of medical relief for 
a very wide territory, and each physician must make extended tours 
throughout his district. In the great majority of the native settle- 
ments, the teachers are the only “ doctors” and “health officers.” It 
often becomes the duty of a teacher to render first aid to the injured 
or to care for a patient through the course of a serious illness. The 
school is often the only place within a radius of several hundred 
miles where the natives can obtain medicines and medical treatment, 
and they often travel many days to secure the relief desired. 
Inadequate as the medical service is to meet the needs of the entire 
native population, it has nevertheless accomplished gratifying results 
as is indicated by the following statement of services rendered during 
the year:

EDUCATION IN ALASKA 837 
INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION 
In the day schools industrial education supplements to some ex- 
tent the academic work, but one of the greatest needs in connection 
with the present educational system is that more training of a voca- 
tional character be provided. It is important that as much training 
as possible be given to enable the natives of Alaska more readily to 
earn a livelihood in the changing conditions with which the advance 
of civilization has confronted them. 
Many natives, with very little supervision, would become excellent 
carpenters. In all parts of Alaska their skill in carving proves that 
the making of furniture could be made a very remunerative native 
industry. In the native houses well-constructed articles of furniture 
could be made to take the place of the cheap and often unsatisfactory 
furniture which they now buy in stores. In the shops they could be 
taught how to make cooking utensils, sled runners, anchors, chains, 
and rigging for their boats. In Alaska almost all communication is 
‘by water. The aboriginal races of Alaska have always been expert 
builders of canoes. In the progressive villages power boats and 
small schooners have replaced the primitive native canoe. Boat 
building would, therefore, be a very important subject of instruction. 
The natives could also be taught how to construct and repair engines 
for their power boats. Their skill in sewing and in the making of 
ceremonial robes shows that they would make excellent tailors. 
With very little training they would excel in mechanical trades, such 
as typesetting and printing. In the weaving of baskets they are 
proficient. This talent, which in some parts of Alaska appears to be 
disappearing among the rising generation, could be fostered. 
Special industrial schools are in process of organization at Ek- 
lutna, near Anchorage, on the Alaska Railroad, at Kanakanak in 
southwestern Alaska, and at White Mountain on the Seward Penin- 
sula, where buildings have been erected and to which teachers have 
been sent to develop courses in such activities as carpentry, boat 
building, carving, the tanning of reindeer hides and of the skins of 
fur-bearing animals, the curing of fish, tailoring, nursing, home 
economics, sanitation, and physical education. 
REINDEER SERVICE 
Originating, in 1892, in importation of reindeer from Siberia to 
furnish subsistence for the Eskimos in the neighborhood of Bering 
Strait, the reindeer industry has expanded until it has assumed chief 
importance in the bureau’s industrial activities in behalf of the 
natives. Heérds are now maintained near all of the principal native 
settlements of western Alaska from the Arctic Ocean to the Pacific  
-P-A-G-E-342
  
838 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1922-1924 
Ocean; in the interior near Mount McKinley National Park; along 
the Alaska Railroad; on Kodiak Island west of the Gulf of Alaska; 
along the Alaska Peninsula; and on the Aleutian Islands. So rap- 
idly have the herds increased that the total number of reindeer in 
Alaska in June, 1924, was estimated at 350,000, of which about 
235,000 were owned by the natives. One of the principal problems 
confronting the Bureau of Education at this time is the reorganiza- 
tion of the reindeer industry on a cooperative basis so as to make it 
possible to handle more efficiently the increasing herds and market 
the surplus meat. This reorganization will attempt to care not only 
for the distribution of the herds, as in the past, but for handling the 
industry on a business basis. The present commercial value of 
Alaskan reindeer herds is approximately $8,750,000; $1,550,000 more 
than the sum paid for the Territory by the United States in 1867. 
This does not take account of more than 200,000 reindeer slaughtered 
in the past and used as meat by the natives or sold by them, nor does 
it include the benefit derived by the natives through participation in , 
this great industrial success. 
TRANSPORTATION OF APPOINTEES A N D SUPPLIES 
One of the greatest problems in connection with the work of the 
bureau in Alaska has been the transportation of appointees and sup- 
plies from Seattle to the remoter settlements. In April, 1920, the 
U.S. S. Bower, a wooden vessel which had been used as a training 
ship for naval cadets, was transferred from the Navy Department 
to the Interior Department for use by the bureau in connection with 
its work in Alaska. Funds to cover the expense of fitting the vessel 
for service in Alaskan waters were provided in the Interior Depart- 
ment appropriation act approved May 24, 1922. During the winter 
months of 1922-23 a Diesel engine was installed in the vessel and it 
was refitted for its work in the waters of the Pacific and Arctic 
Oceans as far north as Point Barrow. 
Annually the Bower carries from Seattle to the coast villages of 
Alaska and to the distributing points at the mouths of the great 
rivers teachers, physicians, and nurses, together with a heavy tonnage 
of supplies and equipment. On its southward voyages it brings out 
employees whose terms of service have expired, and carries reindeer 
meat, furs, and other valuable commodities which the Eskimos wish 
to be sold for them through the Seattle office of the Alaska division. 
During the winter of 1923-24 in‘ four-months cruise in Southeast- 
ern Alaska the Bower served as a floating school for 20 native young 
men, with the ship’s officers as instructors in navigation, radio teleg- 
raphy, the operation and care of Diesel engines, dynamos, and 
marine machinery, also in cooking, personal hygiene, and physical 
 
-P-A-G-E-343
  EDUCATION IN ALASKA 839 
training, as well as in general elementary subjects, with special 
emphasis on speaking and writing English. 
During its cruise in the summer of 1924, in addition to performing 
its routine duties, the Boxer rescued the crews of the Lady Kinders- 
ley and the Arctic, schooners which had been caught in the ice near 
Point Barrow, the northwesternmost cape of the continent. This 
action saved the lives of these men. The Bower also took on board at 
Point Barrow a party of eight men of the United States Geological 
Survey and conveyed them to Nome. But for this service, these 
men would have been compelled to wait at Point Barrow for two 
months until the freeze up, and then would have had to proceed to 
Nome by dog sled, with great loss of time, and at a cost to the Gov- 
ernment of thousands of dollars.

This report attempts to give brief summaries of the data contained 
in these seven publications, and to add such material as may seem to 
be of value. 
Table 1.—This table presents a summary of the enrollments in 
various types of schools, classified by control, public or private. 
Table 2.—In this table the per capita costs are based upon the total 
enrollments as reported either by State or by local authorities. The 
total cost includes current expenses and capital outlays, but does not 
include payments for debt services. For college and university costs 
the total receipts, excluding additions to endowments, are used. The 
per capita costs for public elementary and for public high schools are 
estimated from city school reports and from the few State reports 
where it is possible to divide the expenditure between elementary and 
high schools. For private elementary and for private high schools 
the per capita costs are estimated to be the same as for public schools 
of the same type. 
Tables .3 and 4 present historical summaries concerning gifts and 
endowments to education. The bureau has gathered this informa- 
tion for even-numbered years only since 1916. 
Table 5.—This table shows distribution of teachers by sex and by 
type of school for each 10-year period from 1890 to 1924. The per- 
centage of men teachers has been gradually decreasing during this 
period until 1924. For 1890 it is 35.8 per cent; 32.6 per cent for 
1900; 25.2 per cent for 1910; 18.5 per cent for 1920; and 21.2 per cent 
for 1924.

school enrollment shows an increase of 67 per cent for this period; 
the private elementary schools show a loss of 11 per cent. Kinder- 
garten enrollments have increased 1,882 per cent, those of public high 
schools 1,570 per cent, private high schools 168 per cent, preparatory 
departments of colleges 20 per cent, secondary students in normal 
schools 331 per cent, and all secondary-school pupils 946 per cent. 
There is an increase of 606 per cent in normal-school enrollments, 445 
per cent in college and university enrollments, and 139 per cent in 
commercial-school enrollments. These increases are shown graphi- 
cally for colleges and for secondary schools.

VALUE OF SCHOOL PROPERTY 
The States report a total valuation of public elementary and 
secondary school property of $3,744,780,714. Private high schools 
and academies report $396,616,100. Exclusive of endowments, 
teachers colleges and normal schools report property valued at 
$136,623,958, and colleges and universities at $1,056,929,060. If the 
value of school property used by the private elementary schools be 
estimated at $300,000,000, and $12,862,722 be included as endow- 
ment owned by teacher-training institutions, and $814,718,813 as pro- 
ductive funds of colleges and universities, the total value of property 
used by all types of schools mentioned above is $6,462,531,367.
-P-A-G-E-347
  STATISTICAL SUMMARY OF EDUCATION 343 
The average value of public-school property per pupil enrolled has 
increased from $129 in 1922 to $154 in 1924. This increase is due 
not so much to increased values of real estate as it’ is to newer and 
better buildings, better equipment, and more extensive grounds. 
It is safe to say that our public-school children were never better 
housed than at present, although there is still room for improve- 
ment. A large number of cities report considerable congestion. 
The percentage of public-school expenditures going for sites, build- 
ings, and contents for 1920 is 14.8 per cent; for 1922 it is 19.4 per 
cent; and for 1924 it is 21.3 per cent. This increase over previous 
years reflects the efforts of school districts toward resuming building 
programs that were curtailed during the war period or held in abey- 
ance when building costs began to increase so rapidly above the 
pre-war figures. 
In the matter of permanent school funds for public-school education, 
Texas leads with a total of over $80,000,000. Minnesota has forty- 
four million, Virginia and Oklahoma have nearly twenty-four and one 
half million each, and South Dakota has twenty-four million in 
a permanent school fund. North Dakota, Washington, Montana, 
Indiana, New Jersey, Missouri, Wyoming, Kansas, and Nebraska 
each has a permanent school fund of over $10,000,000. 
Nearly a half billion dollars of public-school resources are in school 
lands. Minnesota leads with $85,000,000, South Dakota has seventy- 
five million, Montana forty-six million, Colorado forty-one million, 
ped eight other States have unsold lands valued at over $10,000,000 
each.

CHAPTER XX 
STATISTICS OF STATE SCHOOL SYSTEMS, 1923-24 
The data presented in this report relate to schools supported by 
public funds, and include kindergartens, elementary grades, and 
high schools. Data for junior colleges and other colleges supported 
by public funds have been omitted where it was possible to identify 
them. Table 4 contains enrollments, or estimates of enrollments, 
in private elementary and high schools, but neither enrollments nor 
expenditures of private schools have been included in the other 
tables. 
Increases are noted in 1924 over 1920 both in numbers and in 
percentages of enrollments. If we assume all children enrolled in 
1920 to be of school age, 5 to 17 inclusive, 77.8 per cent of those 
of school age were enrolled in public schools. In 1924 this had in- 
creased to 82.8 per cent. In 1920, 58.2 per cent of those of school 
age were in school every day, and in 1924, 65.2 per cent were in 
average daily attendance. The per cent of those enrolled who were 
in average daily attendance in 1920 was 74.8, and in 1924 the per 
cent was 78.8. In 1920, 7.91 per cent of the school census were 
enrolled.in public high schools; in 1924 this had increased to 11.55 
per cent. In 1924, 20,898,930 pupils were enrolled in the public 
elementary schools, and 3,389,878 in the public high schools. Al- 
though the general increase in enrollment in 1924 is about 414 per 
cent over that of 1922, seven States, Delaware, Idaho, Iowa, Ken- 
tucky, Louisiana, Maine, and Montana, show losses during this 
two-year period. Fifteen States show losses in the elementary 
grades, but the increases in high-school enrollment more than make 
up the losses in eight States. The increase in percentage of enroll- 
ment in the high school is from 12.3 per cent in 1922 to 14 per cent 
in 1924. This high-school enrollment does not include elementary 
grades in junior high schools. 
The number of teachers employed increased from 722,976 in 1922 
to 761,308 in 1924. In 1922 there were 34.2 elementary pupils 
enrolled to each elementary teacher; in 1924 there were 33.9. The 
corresponding figures for high-school pupils enrolled per high-school 
teacher are 22.2 and 23.5.

  CHAPTER XXII 
CITY, SCHOOL SYSTEMS, 1923-24 
INTRODUCTION 
This report presents the statistics of public schools in cities for the 
school year 1923-24. The cities are grouped ‘according to the popu- 
lation groups as set forth by the Bureau of the Census. The various 
tables describe these groups with respect to size. Every city in 
Group I made a report. Groups II and III are 98 per cent complete. 
This degree of completeness is due largely to the fact that some cities 
were visited by field agents of the bureau, who obtained many reports 
by personal solicitation and collaboration. Careful estimates have 
been made for cities which failed to report. Summary tables are 
given by States for cities in Group IV. The other groups are re- 
ported in detail. 
In Groups I, I, and III, 773 cities report 23, 225 schools and 14,922 
buildings. The éshogls were in session for an average of 185 days, 
19.4 per cent of the population were enrolled, 81.4 per cent of those 
enrolled were in average daily attendance, and 36.3 pupils were 
enrolled per teacher employed.

CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS, 1923-1924 405 
COMPARATIVE DATA 
The following tabulation presents some comparisons between 1922 
and 1924 for cities in the first three groups: 
Pupils per teacher, salary of teachers, and per pupil cost ee instruction, for certain 
types of schools in Groups I, II, and III

Slight increases are noted in size of classes in kindergartens, 
elementary schools, high schools, normal schools, and vocational 
schools. The salary trend is upward for every type of school, the 
largest increase being in city normal schools, where a 20 per cent 
increase occurs. Per pupil cost of instruction increases for every 
type of school excepting vocational schools. The data for city 
colleges are too incomplete to make comparisons with 1922: 
PER CAPITA COSTS 
No tables are presented in this bulletin showing per capita costs 
of education in cities, as that material was presented in Statistical 
Circular No. 4. A study of 35 representative cities in Group I 
shows an average total cost, excluding debt service, of $95.64 per 
pupil in average daily attendance, which is an increase of $10.96 
over that for 30 representative cities of this class for 1922. This is 
an expenditure of 3.4 per cent for general control, 76.9 per cent 
for instruction, 9.6 per cent for operation of plant, 5.6 per cent for 
maintenance, 2.5 per cent for auxiliary agencies, and 2 per cent for 
fixed charges. 
In Group II, 55 representative cities had an average total cost of 
$87.12 per pupil, an increase of $7.08 over the average for 40 repre- 
sentative cities of this class for 1922. Of this total expenditure, 
3.4 per cent is for general control, 77 per cent for instruction, 11.1 
per cent for operation of plant, 4 per cent for maintenance, 2.8 per 
cent for auxiliary agencies, and 1.7 per cent for fixed charges. 
In Group III, 55 representative cities have an average total cost 
of $73.90 per pupil in average daily attendance, an increase of $0.18 
over that for 50 representative cities of this class for 1922. Of this
-P-A-G-E-410
    406 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1922-1924 
total cost, 3.6 per cent is for general control, 77.9 per cent for instruc- 
tion, 11.5 per cent for operation of plant, 3.6 per cent for maintenance, 
1.9 per cent for auxiliary agencies, and 1.5 per cent for fixed charges. 
In Group IV, 50 representative cities show an average total cost 
per pupil of $74.91, an increase of $10.78 over that for 50 representa- 
tive cities of this class for 1922. The total cost is divided as follows: 
5.5 per cent for general control, 72.3 per cent for instruction, 13 per 
cent for operation of plant, 3.9 per cent for maintenance, 3.6 per 
cent for auxiliary agencies, and 1.7 per cent for fixed charges. 
The total range of per pupil costs for 1924 for the cities included 
above is as follows: Group I, from $35.74 to $133.32; Group II, 
$35.52 to $125.05; Group III, $24 to $110.85: and Group IV, from 
$34.25 to $165.51. 
The following tables present in detail the personnel and financial 
statistics for cities of 10,000 population or more:

FESSIONAL SCHOOLS, 1923-1924 
INSTITUTIONS REPORTING 
For the school year 1923-24 reports were received from 913 uni- 
versities, colleges, and professional schools. Of this number 144 are 
under public control and 769 under private control; 150 are indepen- 
dent professional schools. There are 165 schools of theology, 124 
schools of law, 80 schools of medicine, 43 schools of dentistry, 63 schools 
of pharmacy, 6 schools of osteopathy, and 12 schools of veterinary 
medicine. In 1922 reports were received from 780 universities, col- 
leges, and professional schools. The addition of 133 reports of 
schools in 1924 is due in part to the efforts of field agents of the 
Bureau of Education, who secured many reports by personal visits. |

COMPARATIVE STATISTICS 
Table 1 presents historical statistics for instructors, students, and 
degrees, by 10-year periods, from 1890 to the present time. There 
were enrolled in 1890, excluding duplicates and preparatory students, 
a total of 121,942 students in collegiate courses. In 1900 this en- 
rollment had reached 167,999; in 1910 it was 266,654; and in 1924 it 
amounted to 664,266, During this 34-year period the general 
population increased about 78 per cent, while enrollment of collegiate 
students increased 445 per cent. During this period enrollments in 
all kinds of secondary students increased 951 per cent. College 
enrollment, therefore, has grown nearly 6 times as fast as the general 
population, and secondary school enrollments have grown about 12 
times as fast as the general population. Since college growth must 
of necessity come through the secondary schools, the continuous 
growth of the secondary schools becomes one of primary importance. 
The number of instructors, excluding those in preparatory de- 
partments, in 1890 is reported as 10,762, in 1900 as 18,056, in 1910 
as 29,083, and in 1924 as 51,907. The number of students per 
teacher for each of these four years is 11.3, 9.3, 9.2, and 12.8. 
‘From 1922 to 1924 the number of baccalaureate degrees conferred 
increased from 47,854 to 61,285; the number of first professional 
degrees from 12,053 to 17,357; and the number of graduate degrees 
from 7,332 to 9,261. During this two-year period the amount of 
productive funds of these institutions increased from $699,213,452 to 
$814,718,813, and the total annual receipts from $326,535,304 to 
$387,694,609. There is also an increase in student fees from $64,- 
296,212 in 1922 to $81,168,998 in 1924. The student fees in 1924 are 
about 21 per cent of the total receipts, which means that for every 
dollar the student pays $4 more must come from other sources. 
The summer-school enrollment increased from 25,538 men and 
52,521 women in 1918 to 36,469 men and 58,369 women in 1920, to 
62,994 men and 85,069 women in 1922, and to 76,155 men and 
113,788 women in 1924. » This is an annual increase of about 20 per 
cent for the men and 13 per cent for the women. In 1918, 33 per 
cent of the summer-school enrollment were men, and in 1924 this 
had increased to 40 per cent. The increase in enrollment in 1924 
over 1918 is 198 per cent for the men and 117 per cent for the women.

  CHAPTER XXIII 
STATISTICS OF TEACHERS COLLEGES AND NORMAL 
SCHOOLS, 1923-24 
ContEntTs.—Review of the statistics—Statistical summaries (Tables 1-21)—Teachers colleges: Sessions, 
graduates, degrees conferred; instructors; students; property and income; expenditures (Tables 
22-26)—State normal schools (Tables 27-31)—City normal schools (Tables 32-33)—Private normal 
schools (Tables 34-37). 
This report contains statistics from 382 institutions engaged prima- 
rily in training teachers. It is supplemented by data from secondary 
schools showing the number of pupils in teacher-training courses, and 
from colleges and universities with a department of education, show- 
ing the number of college students preparing for the profession of 
teaching. Table 1 gives a summary by States of the number in 
teacher preparation in each type of school, and of the number of 
public-school teaching positions in each State. In a few States the 
number of teaching positions is for 1922. 
The total number of these teaching positions is 742,172, and the 
number preparing to teach in the types of schools mentioned is 
reported as 418,533. Of this number, 253,747, or about 61 per cent, 
are enrolled in the regular sessions, and 191,311 in the summer ses- 
sions, both enrollments including 26,525 duplicates. If the regular 
students in these colleges attend the full four years, those in normal 
schools two years, and those in high schools one year, these institu- 
tions would be turning out 107,488 prospective teachers each year, 
or about one for every seven teaching positions. Taking the average 
training period as two years, 126,874 annual recruits would take care 
of all these teaching positions in six years. 
Many do not teach, even after preparation, and some teach with- 
out formal training. There are always teachers to be found whose 
training was in some of the 212 colleges not included in this report, 
some from the better type of commercial and business schools, and 
~ some from other schools. There are also in the United States about 
150,000 teaching positions in colleges and schools other than public 
schools. The work of supplying recruits for all these positions, and 
of improving those already employed is of vital importance. 
The summer-school enrollment is composed of those already teach- 
ing who desire to improve their positions, those who wish to shorten 
the period of training by attending both regular sessions and summer 
sessions, and those who wish to use the summer school as a short 
course in the preparation of teaching.

  738 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1922-1924 
It is difficult to analyze the situation with respect to each State, 
since so many students prepare in one State and later teach in another. 
Most States provide ample training facilities for those wishing to 
follow the profession of teaching. A study of columns 7 and 13 of 
Table 1 shows the following States with more than one-half as many 
students in teacher-training institutions preparing to teach as there 
are public-school teaching positions in those States: Oklahoma, 
Nebraska, Wisconsin, North Dakota, Kansas, Washington, Missouri, 
Michigan, Colorado, Alabama, South Dakota, Virginia, and Idaho. 
It is also possible to make comparisons between columns 11 or 12, 
and 13, but it must be kept in mind that column 11 includes those in 
institutions under private control, and 12 excludes students in sum- 
mer sessions only, while 13 does not include teaching positions in 
schools other than public schools. 
Table 2 gives a sex distribution of those preparing to teach and 
taking training in secondary schools and collegés. A study of this 
table and of Table 3 shows 81,718 men and 336,815 women in 
teacher training. Of the public-school teaching positions, 16.3 
per cent are filled by men, and 19.5 per cent of those in teacher 
training are men. Better salaries are no doubt attracting more men 
toward the teaching profession, and the openings in other fields 
of work are perhaps taking women from the work of teaching. 
Of the 382 institutions included in Table 3, 88 are teachers colleges, 
108 State normal schools, 67 private normal schools, 29 city normals, 
and 90 county normals. Since 1922 there has been an increase of 
40,963 students in these schools. The increase in number taking 
teacher-training courses is 51,115. This is an increase of 25.5 per 
cent for women, and 30.1 per cent for men. 
The list of teachers colleges has been changed since 1922, the 
following 11 schools having been added: 
State Teachers College, Chico, Calif. 
State Teachers College, San Diego, Calif. 
State Teachers College, San Francisco, Calif. 
Western Kentucky State Normal School and Teachers College, Bowling Green, 
Ky. 
Eastern Kentucky State Normal School and Teachers College, Richmond, Ky. 
Eastern State Teachers College, Madison, 8. Dak. 
State Normal School, Spearfish, 8. Dak. 
Sul Ross State Normal School, Alpine, Tex. 
Stephen F. Austin Teachers College, Nacogdoches, Tex. 
Concord State Normal School, Athens, W. Va. 
State Normal School, Fairmont, W. Va. 
The following schools formerly on the teachers college list now 
appear elsewhere: 
Chicago Teachers College, Chicago, Il. 
Tri-State College, Angola, Ind. 
State Normal School, Buffalo, N. Y.

CHAPTER XXIV 
STATISTICS OF PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS, 1923-24 
  
ContENTS.— Introduction — Enrollment— Military drill— Teachers — Size of high school— Graduates— 
Type of high school—Survivals—Statistical tables 
INTRODUCTION 
The Bureau of Education has a record of 19,442 public high schools 
in the United States. Reports were received from 14,827 for the 
school year 1923-24, of which number 704 are classified as junior 
high schools, 1,316 as junior-senior high schools, and 181 as three- 
year senior high schools. In 1924, reports were received from 771 
more schools than reported in 1922. There were 16,300 public high 
schools in 1918. 
All two-year, three-year, and four-year junior high schools which 
ate separately organized have been included in the statistics of junior 
high schools. The junior portions of junior-senior high schools have 
been included in the junior-senior statistics. All types of junior- 
senior high schools, whether organized on the 2-4, 4-2, 2-3, 3-2, 3-3, 
or 6-year undivided plan, are included in the statistics of junior-senior 
high schools. Only three-year high schools containing grades corre- 
sponding to the traditional 10, 11, and 12, when separately organized 
as senior high schools, have been included in the statistics of senior 
high schools. In tables showing enrollment in elementary grades, 
the sixth and seventh grades of those schools having only seven years 
in the elementary course are tabulated with the seventh and eighth 
grades of schools having eight years of elementary work. 
ENROLLMENT 
The total enrollment reported for 1924 is 2,538,381, which is an 
increase of 308,974 over that reported for 1922. The State depart- 
ments of education report a total of 3,407,801 in public high schools 
in the various States, which indicates that State department reports 
are more complete than those of the Bureau of Education. The 
total number of colored students reported for 1924 is 51,745, an 
increase of 16,014, or 44.8 per cent over 1922. The greatest increase 
is in the number of colored girls enrolled, 46.2 per cent. The increase 
for all types of students reported is 13.9 per cent. The increases for 
the several years of high school are as follows: First year, 7.5 per 
cent; second year, 13.9 per cent; third year, 18.7 per cent; fourth 
year, 25.3 per cent. These figures indicate a healthy growth for the

-P-A-G-E-802
  798 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1922-1924 
public high school, and that the students already enrolled are staying 
in school longer. 
Enrollments were taken by course of study, with instructions not 
to include single subjects of study, but subjects organized in groups. 
Academic courses were reported by 14,783 schools, with 2,318,363 
students taking such courses; 3,742 schools have 430,975 in com- 
mercial courses; 3,860 schools have 160,140 in home economics 
courses; 2,089 schools have 155,167 in manual training courses; 
2,604 schools have 56,469 in agriculture courses; 434 schools have 
41,998 in industrial or trade courses, and 1,453 schools have 34,138 
in teacher-training courses. The same data were gathered in 1918. 
The increase in number taking industrial and trade courses since 
1918 is 153 per cent; in academic courses, 86 per cent; in manual 
training courses, 60 per cent; in home economics courses, 57 per cent; 
in commercial courses, 55 per cent; in agriculture courses, 46 per 
cent; and in teacher-training courses, 28 per cent. The greatest per 
cent of increase, therefore, is in industrial and trade courses, and the 
least in teacher-training courses. j 
MILITARY DRILL 
In 1918, 1,276 public high schools were offering military drill 
to 112,683 boys. In 1920, there were 688 such schools, offering it to 
98,831 boys; and in 1924, 300 schools offering military training 
to 55,964 boys. In 1914, only 82 schools offered military training, to 
9,532 boys. These figures show the ability of the public high school 
to meet an emergency and then to direct attention elsewhere when 
the emergency passes. 
TEACHERS 
The number of public high-school teachers reported for 1924 is 
133,395, or an increase of 35,741 over 1920. This is an increase of 
40.6 per cent for men teachers, and 34.4 per cent for women. The 
number of students per teacher has increased from 20.5 in 1920 to 
22.1 in 1922. 
SIZE OF HIGH SCHOOL 
No tabulation is presented showing size of high school by States. 
There are reported 5,110 schools with 50 students or less, and 9,150 
with 100 or less. With from 101 to 200 students there are 2,618 
schools; with 201 to 500, 1,728 schools; with 501 to 1,000,717 schools; 
and with more than 1,000 students, 614 schools. There are 13 high 
schools with an enrollment of more than 5,000 each, one having 
8,410 students. The average size has increased from 140 students 
in 1920 to 199 in 1924,

  PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS 799 
GRADUATES 
In 1918, 14.5 per cent of the public-high school pupils were enrolled 
in the fourth year of work, and 93.8 per cent of the senior class 
graduated. In 1924, 15.7 per cent of the pupils were in the fourth 
year of work, and 91.3 per cent of the senior class graduated. From 
the graduating class of 1917, 38.1 per cent of the boys went to col- 
lege the following year, and from the 1923 class, 37.2 per cent went 
to college. From the 1917 class, 21.4 per cent of the girls went to 
college the year following graduation, and from the 1923 class, 25.9 
per cent went to college. The per cent going to other institutions is 
about the same for each year; 9 per cent of the boys and 17 per cent 
of the girls were attending some other institution the year following 
graduation. In 1917, 42 per cent of the graduates attended some 
higher institution the year following graduation, and in 1923, 44.5 
per cent attended some higher institution. 
TYPE OF HIGH SCHOOL 
There are 19 public high schools of the distinctively business and 
commercial type, and 139 of the vocational and technical type. 
Many of these schools are equipped with modern machinery, and use 
up-to-date methods of instruction in the various trades, vocations, 
and occupations. 
SURVIVALS 
No adjustments have been made for increase in population, deaths, 
immigration, retardation, or duplication, in obtaining the percent- 
age in Table 2. The first year enrollments are taken as bases, and 
divided into the enrollments of the second, third, and fourth year 
of the high school for the first, second, and third year following the 
basic year.

CHAPTER XXV 
STATISTICS OF PRIVATE HIGH SCHOOLS AND 
ACADEMIES, 1923-24 
For the school year ending June 30, 1924, a total of 2,124 private 
high schools and academies sent statistical reports to the Bureau of 
Education. This represents an increase of 161 schools over the num- 
ber of 1922, 31 over 1920, and a loss of 124 since 1915. The average 
size of school increased from 96 in 1922 to 102 in 1924. The largest 
increase in enrollment is reported by the State of New York, where 
5,065 more pupils are reported than in 1922. Ohio, Illinois, and 
Massachusetts follow with increases of between 2,000 and 3,000 pupils 
each, and the District of Columbia, Virginia, California, and New 
Jersey report increases of more than 1,000 each over enrollments in 
1922. Eleven more States report increases of more than 500 each in 
enrollment for this two-year period. These gains are confined chiefly 
to the eastern and southeastern portions of the United States. The 
total enrollment for 1924 is 216,522, an increase of 29,881 over that 
reported for 1922. 
While the enrollment was increasing 16 per cent over that for 1922, 
the number of graduates increased 27 per cent, the number of fourth- 
year pupils 29 per cent, and the number above fourth year 51 per 
cent. The number of boys enrolled increased 19 per cent, and the 
number of girls 13 per cent. In the four-year schools, the rates of 
increase are a little higher than for all schools. In schools for boys 
only the increase in enrollment is 18 per cent, and in those for girls 
only it is 8 per cent. 
The increase in number of teachers in 1924 over that of 1922 has not 
kept pace with the increase in the number of students. The rate of 
increase for teachers is 10.3 per cent. For men teachers it is 13.7 per 
cent and for women teachers 8.2 per cent. The number of students per 
teacher, 13.8, is an increase of approximately one since 1922. The 
value of buildings and grounds is reported as 27.3 per cent higher than 
in 1922, and of furniture and scientific apparatus as 15 per cent 
higher. The increase in endowment reported for the two-year period 
is 21.9 per cent, or a little more than $11,000,000. 
The number of pupils in schools for the negro race increased 
16.7 per cent from 1922 to 1924. The number of pupils per teacher in 
these schools was 15.6 in 1924, which was approximately 2 more than 
the number for each teacher in schools for white pupils.

CHAPTER XXVI 
STATISTICS OF KINDERGARTENS, 1923-24 
  
This report contains statistics of public and of private kindergar- 
tens for the school year 1923-24. Increases appear in the number 
of kindergartens, number of teachers, and in the number of pupils 
enrolled, over those reported in 1922. The largest increase is in 
California, where the kindergarten enrollment increased 29 per cent 
during this two-year period, and the public school enrollment in- 
creased 22 per cent. 
Reports ‘were received from 126 more private kindergartens in 
1924 than in 1922, but 567 fewer pupils were enrolled. In villages 
having a population of fewer than 2,500, reports were received from 
896 public kindergartens, a gain of 204 over 1922. In cities of 2,500 
and over, reports were received from 7,619 public kindergartens, 
an increase of 615 over 1922. The total enrollment for all types of 
kindergartens in 1924 is 618,819, which is 12.8 per cent of all children 
in the United States of ages 4 and 5. A total of 12,992 teachers were 
employed in 9,834 schools. 
In the public kindergartens the average annual salary of a super- 
visor for 1924 is $2,472, and of a teacher $1,564, both salaries being 
slight increases over 1922. In the private kindergartens the average 
annual salary of a director is $1,720, of a teacher $914, and of an 
assistant teacher $648, all of which are decreases from 1922. 
In 1914 the bureau received reports from 1,571 private kinder- 
gartens, having 2,139 teachers, 74,725 pupils, and an average daily 
attendance of 51,684. In the same year 7,254 public kindergartens 
reported 8,430 teachers, 391,143 pupils, and an average daily attend- 
ance of 224,978. In 1924, 1,319 private kindergartens reported 1,390 
teachers, 54,456 pupils, and an average daily attendance of 36,564. 
In 1924, 8,515 public kindergartens reported 10,852 teachers, 564,363 
pupils, and an average daily attendance of 330,154. The loss in 
enrollment in the private kindergartens is due largely to the absorp- 
tion of the private kindergarten in some localities by the public 
school systems. The increase noted in the public kindergartens is 
due to several causes; namely: (1) Continuous healthy growth of 
kindergartens; (2) absorption of the private kindergartens; (3) in- 
crease in school attendance in general; (4) growth of cities; and (5) 
more complete returns. 
The urban population has increased from 47,021,513 in 1914 to 
59,159,996 in 1924. The total number of children in kindergartens 
in 1914 is 465,868, which is less than 1 per cent of the urban popula- 
tion. For 1924 the number in kindergartens is 618,819, which is

1.04 per cent of the urban population. This is a gain of five hun- 
dredths of { per cent during the past decade. At present more than 
one-half of the population of the United States lives in cities. If the 
4,848,902 children 4 and 5 years of age are about evenly divided 
between urban and rural, the public schools of the cities furnish 85

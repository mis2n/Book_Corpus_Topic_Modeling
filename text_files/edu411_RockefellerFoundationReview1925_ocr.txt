Review of Work in 1925 
By Grorcr E. Vincent 
PRESIDENT 
THE YEAR IN BRIEF 
During 1925 the Rockefeller Foundation in spending 
$9,113,730 through its departmental agencies, the Inter- 
national Health Board, the China Medical Board, the Divi- 
sion of Medical Education, and the Division of Studies (1), 
aided the governments of eighteen countries to combat hook- 
worm disease; (2) gave funds to the budgets of organized 
rural health services in 220 counties in twenty-six American 
states and in eighteen districts in Brazil, Poland, Czecho- 
slovakia, Austria, and France; (3) took precautionary 
measures against yellow fever in Salvador, Guatemala, 
Nicaragua, and Honduras; (4) continued to work with 
Brazil in freeing its northern coast from this disease; (5) 
sent a yellow fever commission to the West Coast of Africa; 
(6) helped to show the possibilities of malaria control in 
twelve American states and in Brazil, Argentina, and Italy; 
(7) shared in the development of professional training of 
public health officers at Harvard University and the Uni- 
versity of Toronto and in schools and institutes in London, 
Copenhagen, Prague, Warsaw, Belgrade, Zagreb, Budapest, 
Trinidad, and Sao Paulo; (8) contributed to the progress of 
medical education at Cambridge, Edinburgh, Copenhagen, 
Brussels, Utrecht, Strasbourg, Beirut, Singapore, Bangkok, 
Sao Paulo, and Montreal; (9) provided emergency aid in the 
form of literature and laboratory supplies for 112 medical 
centers in Europe; (10) maintained a modern medical school 
and teaching hospital in Peking with 195 students and 
eighty-seven teachers; (11) aided two other medical schools

teaching of physics, chemistry, and biology in three Chinese 
and seven foreign institutions in China and in the govern- 
ment university of Siam; (13) supported nurse training 
courses in Peking Union Medical College, Yale University, 
Vanderbilt University, and the George Peabody College for 
Teachers, and contributed to nursing education and service 
in Brazil, France, Yugoslavia, and Poland; (14) provided 
current funds for an Institute of Biological Research in the 
Johns Hopkins University; (15) assisted departments at Yale 
and Iowa State universities engaged in biological and mental 
research, and aided the Marine Biological Station at Pacific 
Grove, California; (16) provided, directly or indirectly, fel- 
lowships for 842 men and women from forty-four different 
countries, and financed the travel of fifty other persons either 
in commissions or as visiting officials and professors; (17) 
contributed to the League of Nations’ international study 
tours or interchanges for 128 health officers from fifty-eight 
countries; (18) continued to aid the League’s information 
service on communicable diseases; (19) made surveys of 
health conditions, medical education, nursing, biology, and 
anthropology in thirty-five countries; (20) lent staff members 
as advisers and made minor gifts to many governments and 
institutions; (21) assisted mental hygiene projects both in 
the United States and Canada, demonstrations in dispensary 
development in New York City, and other undertakings in 
public health, medical education, and allied fields. 
PRIVATE AID IN PUBLIC TASKS 
The recent growth in the number and resources of privately 
endowed foundations, notably, although not exclusively, in 
the United States of America, has quite properly raised 
questions as to the place of these agencies in the social order 
and their relation to the work of governments. The new 
organizations are aiding elementary and high schools, col- 
leges, universities, medical schools, teaching hospitals, and 
museums of science and art; they are promoting research

PRIVATE AID IN PUBLIC TASKS 9

The Jones County (Mississippi) Health Department, towards whose budget the 
International Health Board contributed during 1925, displayed this exhibit at the 
County Fair as one means of educating the people in hygiene. 
in the natural and social sciences and in the activities of cities, 
states, and nations; they are providing fellowships for investi- 
gation and for the development of teachers; they are promot- 
ing international intercourse, scientific and cultural; they are 
helping societies for community service and civic betterment. 
Several of the foundations are at work in the field of public 
health and hygiene. 
In only a few of these activities do the private Funds come 
into direct relations with the tasks of government. Aid to a 
state-supported university may raise questions of principle 
and policy. Inquiry into the methods of government is 
quite obviously a matter of some delicacy. Any attempt by 
endowed agencies to influence public opinion or to secure 
specific legislation is likely to be resented. Efforts to substi- 
tute voluntary for governmental machinery are pretty sure to 
make trouble. This applies especially to the task of protect- 
ing a community against disease. For this the government 
must assume primary responsibility. Its power to tax and 
to command obedience is essential.  
-P-A-G-E-10
  10 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
Moreover, the official agency is the continuing source of 
authority; it represents permanence; what it adopts as a part 
of its regular procedure stands a good chance of being per- 
petuated. It is only the government that can maintain the 
sole basis of a sound public health organization. That basis 
is the sanitation of the environment and the control of com- 
municable diseases. Without good water and milk; proper

cannot hope to do effective work in infant and mater-

well-rounded scheme of public health. 
The Rockefeller Foundation, therefore, has adopted the 
policy, so far as public health is concerned, of working only 
with and through governments. Its International Health 
Board lends a hand only on the invitation of an official 
agency. Nor is any effort made to over-persuade a govern- 
ment to undertake a forward step prematurely or with mis- 
giving. The project for which aid is sought must be 
something new in the official program—a qualitative demon- 
stration, not merely an expansion of the old. The whole pur- 
pose is to help a health officer to prove to his community the 
value of an innovation. A further consideration has to do 
with cost. It would be a disservice to put a demonstration

PUBLIC HEALTH i 
on a level which could not later be fairly well maintained out 
of the public funds, for the Board undertakes the co-opera- 
tion only on the clearest understanding that its contribution 
is to diminish steadily until the public budget has assumed 
the whole expense. To withdraw entirely at the earliest mo- 
ment that the success of the demonstration will permit 
is the Board’s constant aim. Co-operation not rivalry, 
response not propaganda, economy not speculation, tempo- 
rary aid not continued subsidy, official responsibility not 
usurpation of authority, a permanent gain not an ephemeral 
exploit, are the watchwords of the Foundation, a private 
agency, in its relations with official organizations of public 
health. 
FROM HOOKWORM TO HYGIENE 
The policy of working with government health depart- 
ments was developed by the Rockefeller Sanitary Commis- 
sion, which in 1910 began to aid several southern states in 
an attempt to control hookworm disease. The undertaking 
followed upon the discovery by Dr. Charles Wardell Stiles of 
the American form of the hookworm parasite, which is very 
like the European type that had been found to be the cause 
of serious and often fatal sickness among miners and tunnel 
workmen. In 1913 this early Commission, renamed the 
International Health Board, became an agency of the Rocke- 
feller Foundation, which was chartered in that year. From 
the beginning, surveys and control measures with respect to 
hookworm disease have played a prominent part in the 
program of the Board and have had a continuing influence 
upon its policies. 
Hookworm disease lends itself well to proving that health 
work pays. It is easily detected, readily cured, and effec- 
tively preventable. The vicious circle of the malady is this: 
minute worms, hatched in contaminated soil, make their way, 
usually through the skin of the foot or leg, into the body of 
their human host. In due time and growing steadily they 
reach their goal, the small intestine, to the walls of which they 
   
-P-A-G-E-12
  12 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
attach themselves for a time. Here they cling, impover- 
ishing the blood of their victim and sending out with the 
wastes of his body eggs which, deposited in a suitably 
moist and warm soil, such as is found in semitropical or 
tropical countries and often in mines, produce a new army of 
invaders. Two or three doses of a drug will drive out the 
parasites or reduce them to a negligible number, but only the 
provision and use of proper latrines will prevent the recurrent 
pollution of the soil and protect a bare-footed population 
against reinfection. 
During 1925 in eighteen different countries the Board had 
a part in official antihookworm measures which included the 
treatment of nearly one and a half million people and the 
erection or rebuild- 
ing of thousands of 
latrines. The areas 
of work were Porto 
Rico and Jamaica 
in the West Indies, 
Mexico, five coun- 
tries of Central 
America, Colombia, 
Paraguay, the Ma- Metanestan Women Wuo Have Bren ATTENDING d . . 
A Lecture on Hooxworm Disrase ras Pr esidency im 
India, Ceylon, Java, 
Siam, the Straits Settlements, and islands of the Indian Ocean 
and the South Sea. In addition to control work, surveys to 
determine degrees of infection and other facts were made in 
Haiti and Montserrat in the West Indies, in certain islands of 
the Seychelles group, in the New Hebrides and Rarotonga in 
the South Pacific, and in a mining district in Spain. 
In reality much more was being done to combat hookworm 
disease than this statement would imply, for in the Southern 
States and elsewhere general health organizations known as 
county units or rural health departments have included 
measures against this malady as a part of their work. From 
the outset the aim was not primarily the relief from one 
     
-P-A-G-E-13
PUBLIC HEALTH 18 
handicap to health, but the education of communities in the 
meaning and possibilities of public hygiene. The purpose 
to use hookworm disease as a means of promoting health 
work in general in tropical and semitropical countries is 
being steadily realized. 
A county health organization usually includes a full-time 
health officer, a sanitary inspector, a public health nurse, and 
a clerk. The annual budget averages about $10,000. The 
Board joins for a time with the local and state authorities in 
providing the necessary funds. The Board’s share rarely ex- 
ceeds a quarter of the whole—the average percentage in 1925 
was 12.8. It grows less each year until it ceases altogether. 
Under this plan in 1925 aid was given to 220 counties in 
twenty-six states of the United States, to eight counties in 
the state of Sao Paulo and to five in the state of Minas 
Geraes in Brazil. The idea has spread to Europe where 
co-operation was extended to the department of Hérault in 
France, to the district of Hartberg in Austria, to a similar 
region in Czechoslovakia, and to two others in Poland. 
YELLOW FEVER RETREATS FROM THE AMERICAS 
Hookworm disease and yellow fever stand in sharp con- 
trast. The one is slow, insidious, undramatic, crippling; the 
other swift, striking, spectacular, deadly. The first, as has 
been explained, is spread by the steady invasion and growth 
of parasitic worms; the second solely by the bite of a certain 
mosquito, the female Stegomyia or Aédes aegypti. This 
insect becomes infective some days after sucking the blood of 
one who is in the early stages of the fever. Prevention in 
the case of this scourge calls for the control of mosquito 
breeding. When such control becomes effective, the fever 
can no longer be transmitted. It leaves only two products, 
the dead and the immune. There are no carriers as in 
hookworm, malaria, or typhoid fever. 
A community in which yellow fever is kept alive by light 
and unnoticed infection in infants and children and an 
abundance of mosquitoes, is an endemic center. With the

coming of non-immune adults the disease flares up in its full 
virulence. From such an endemic center the fever may be 
carried by infected persons—sometimes by infected mosqui- 
toes in ships or trains—to other places where for a time it 
becomes epidemic. It persists until there are no more vic- 
tims or until, in temperate zones, the local mosquitoes are 
benumbed or killed by cold. 
Fortunately the Stegomyia is an insect of domestic habits. 
It lays its eggs in water containers in or near the house. By 
eliminating almost all available breeding-places and by 
watching the few which remain, the sanitarian is able to 
bring mosquito breeding below the danger line. The protec- 
tion of all water containers against mosquitoes by screening, 
 
-P-A-G-E-15
  
PUBLIC HEALTH 15 
or the use in the containers of fish which eat the larvae, will 
put a stop to the production of the Stegomyia. 
During 1925 only three cases of yellow fever were reported 
from all the Americas. These occurred in Northern Brazil. 
It is not quite certain that all three were authentic. To one 
who knows something of the history of yellow fever this 
record is striking. What a contrast to the early days when

It even made its way to the Mediterranean, carried by sick

The opening of this century saw the beginning of an attack 
before which yellow fever has been steadily giving ground. 
Of late it has been in rapid retreat. In 1900 a United States 
Commission headed by Walter Reed discovered in Habana 
the method of transmission. Then Gorgas quickly brought

trol measures had been suspended at the request of local authorities because of a 
severe epidemic of smallpox which the people somehow believed was being spread 
by the visits of the antimosquito staff.

the fever under control in all of Cuba. His methods were 
soon successfully applied in Vera Cruz in Mexico, and in Rio 
de Janeiro and Santos in Brazil. Everywhere quarantine 
measures became more effective. Later, in the Panama 
Canal Zone, Gorgas 
repeated his Cuban 
triumphs. A sense 
of security began 
to pervade regions 
which had once 
lived under the 
shadow of fear. 
But the fever had 
been scotched not 
killed. It lurked 
in old endemic cen- 
ters, and now and 
then broke forth in 
epidemic form. As 
the opening of the 
Panama Canal 
approached, the 
sanitarians of the 
Far East became 
alarmed. New 
trade routes might 
carry the disease

China, India. At 
this time, too, came the suggestion that Gorgas would wel- 
come another and perhaps a final bout with an old foe. The 
Rockefeller Foundation through its International Health 
Board decided to organize a concerted campaign of control. 
In 1916 Gorgas made a preliminary survey and outlined a 
plan of attack, but it was not until 1918 that work began in 
earnest. The essential feature of the strategy was the clean- 
ing up of endemic centers through the team-work of 
governments under central leadership. 
 
-P-A-G-E-17
PUBLIC HEALTH 17 
The plan was carried out step by step. Noguchi isolated 
the fever germ and thus provided means of diagnosis and 
possibly of immunity. Guayaquil in Ecuador, for a century 
and a half a known seed-bed of yellow fever, was rid of the 
disease; an epidemic in Northern Peru was controlled; Mex- 
ico carried out a successful campaign; Central America was 
gradually set free; finally Brazil undertook large-scale opera- 
tions which are proving effective. During 1925. mosquito 
control measures were continued in eleven Brazilian states. 
Solely as a precaution similar work was done in Salvador, 
Guatemala, Nicaragua, and Honduras. Surveys made in 
these four countries and in Venezuela, Peru, and Ecuador 
showed that all were free from yellow fever. 
AN ADVENTURE ON THE GOLD COAST 
Gorgas had included in his plan a commission to the West 
Coast of Africa to study reported epidemics of yellow fever. 
He was on his way to Africa when he fell ill and died in Lon- 
don in July, 1920. Strong evidence has been adduced to 
show that yellow fever is an African disease and not, as it 
used to be believed, a malady indigenous to the New World. 
It was carried, chiefly in slave ships, from the West Coast of 
Africa to America. 
Authorities differ about the prevalence of yellow fever on 
the West Coast. A few have even denied that it is to be 
found there. The relative immunity of the native peoples, 
their tendency to hide their sick, the presence of one or two 
maladies which have symptoms very like those of yellow fever, 
the scarcity of doctors who have had first-hand experience 
with well-authenticated cases, the character of the records, 
have made it difficult, without laboratory tests, to confirm clin- 
ical diagnoses. The commissioners sent under Gorgas found 
no case of yellow fever, but they reported a belief that the 
disease was present and recommended further investigation. 
With the gradual disappearance of yellow fever from the 
Americas, West Africa becomes the last stronghold of this 
stubborn enemy. The fortress is formidable enough. An 
area as large as the United States east of the Mississippi, a
-P-A-G-E-18

tropical climate, the prevalence of many diseases, few and for 
the most part difficult means of travel, a population of thirty 
million natives—superstitious, secretive, and suspicious— 
present a challenge that turns sanitary and health work into 
ahigh adventure. The danger that the completion of trans- 
African railways may carry the fever to the East Coast 
whence it may make its way to India and the Far East re- 
vives the fear which the opening of the Panama Canal 
aroused over ten years ago. 
In July, 1925, the International Health Board established 
  yellow fever headquarters in Lagos in Nigeria. A director,

specially trained bacteriologists, a pathologist, and experts in 
field work make up the staff which has its own housing, com- 
missary, and laboratory equipment. Preliminary studies of 
all available records were made and the data mapped before 
the party left the United States. These provisional outlines 
are being checked on the ground with the hope that endemic 
centers may be delimited. Laboratory tests for the fever are 
being applied to all suspected cases that can be found. 
When a sufficient basis of verified information has been laid, 
plans for control measures will be formulated. The work is

as usual being undertaken on the invitation of the govern- 
ments concerned and with their hearty co-operation. 
The cause of yellow fever control suffered a serious loss in 
the death of Dr. Henry Rose Carter in September, 1925. As 
a member of the United States 
Public Health Service he had 
wide experience with the disease 
in the Southern States, Cuba, 
and Panama. He was the first 
to note (1898) and publish 
(1900) the fact that the fever 
exists for a period outside a 
human host, an observation 
which Walter Reed declared 
had given him the chief clue to 
the insect-borne nature of the 
infection. Dr. Carter’s expert 
counsel throughout the cam- 
paign which began in 1918 was : ; 
of the highest value to the hovel Seprenbe: 14 tos Board’s staff in field and lab- 
oratory. At the time of his death he had completed under 
the Board’s auspices the more important sections of a 
“History of Yellow Fever.” His exhaustive research offers 
strong evidence of the West African origin of the disease. 
By his scientific attainments, unselfish devotion, and noble 
character Henry Rose Carter won the right to be included 
with Reed and Gorgas among the leaders in the winning 
fight against one of the world’s most deadly foes.

A NEW USE FOR PARIS GREEN 
The poison so fatal to the potato bug is now being used to 
lull the larvae of the malaria mosquito. Only by control of 
Anopheles breeding can malaria be satisfactorily prevented. 
Experience proves that large groups of people will not take 
quinine long enough to get rid of the germs of this disease. 
As soon as the sick feel better they discontinue treatment.

There are several ways of heading off the insects that pass the 
infection from person to person. Drainage on a large scale is 
often effective; small ditching projects are helpful; fish will 
eat eggs and larvae in pools, stock-ponds, lakes, and streams 
which are kept free 
from vegetation; 
various oils, or creo- 
sote spread upon 
water surfaces will 
suffocate the “wig- 
glers” when they 
come to the surface 
to breathe. In 1921

periments in dusting large areas from aeroplanes. 
- During 1925 the International Health Board, in conjunc- 
tion with the Italian Government, experimented with the 
new method in two towns, one in Calabria, the other in Sar- 
dinia. The paris green proved effective, cheap, and safe. 
Mosquito breeding was practically stopped at surprisingly 
low costs. It was unnecessary to remove vegetation from 
‘the water before the dust was applied. The minute particles 
which killed the wigglers did no harm to fish or live stock. 
While the use of the new method was gratifying, the demon- 
stration as a whole fell short of being completely convincing. 
Temporary invasions by mosquitoes showed that the areas 
selected for dusting were too small. Then there were other 
complications. At one time groups of townspeople slept in 
distant fields to watch their crops and were exposed to

mosquito attacks. The giving of quinine to school children 
was also continued during the experiment. But in spite of 
these things the undertakings were encouraging and proved 
the possibility of controlling mosquito breeding by the use of 
paris green. 
In addition to these experiments in Italy, assistance in 
malaria control was given in twelve states of the United 
States, in Porto Rico, in the state of Rio de Janeiro in Brazil, 
in the province of Tucuman, Argentina, in Palestine, and in 
the Philippine Islands. Malaria surveys to determine prev- 
alence of infection, nature of mosquito breeding, indicated 
methods of control, etc., were carried out in Haiti and Costa 
Rica. Staff members conferred with the authorities in Cey- 
lon about local malaria problems. A training post for 
malaria workers was maintained at Leesburg, Georgia, and a 
contribution was made towards the expenses of a similar 
center in Corsica for French-speaking malariologists. Short 
training courses were also given 
in Brazil, the Philippines, Italy, 
and Poland. Several important

HEALTH TRAINING FROM TORONTO 
TO BELGRADE 
Health’ work ‘calls ‘for persons, knowledge, power, and 
money, and the greatest of these is persons. With the growth 
of science and the accumulation of experience there is no 
escape from specialization. Men and women must be trained 
for public health as a whole-time vocation which has its own 
peculiar problems and technique. It is at best no job for the 
partial attention of a private practitioner.’ Think of the 
things about which an officer of health should have some 
knowledge: (1) the minute organisms of infection, the animal 
and insect parasites; (2) possibilities of protection by vaccines 
and sera; (3) methods of controlling communicable diseases ; 
(4) sanitation, including water-supplies, sewerage, disposal of 
wastes; (5) hygiene of ventilation, diet, sleep, and exercise; 
(6) mental hygiene, delinquency, feeblemindedness; (7) 
maternity, infant, and school hygiene; (8) the diseases and 
hazards of industry; (9) sanitary and health law; (10) statis- 
tical methods applied to births, deaths, and sickness; (11) the 
organization and administration of public health work; (12) 
education of the community concerning prevention of disease 
and the promotion of physical and mental health. 
The requisite training is given preferably by courses in 
special schools of public health supplemented by experience 
in the practical work of office, laboratory, field, and health 
center. Or when this full preparation is not feasible, ap- 
prenticeship in actual health organization, entered upon 
after a fundamental medical education, may be enriched and 
guided by a series of short courses in universities, in training 
stations, in special institutes, even by correspondence. Only 
for those who occupy responsible positions of general ad- 
ministration is the broadest preparation essential or highly 
desirable. Statisticians, epidemiologists, sanitary inspectors, 
laboratory workers, nurses, technicians, clerical assistants

heed special training, which may be found in many educa- 
tional institutions and may, to a considerable degree, be 
acquired under expert direction in the actual work of public 
health services. The demand for workers so far exceeds the 
number which the special schools can supply that for a long 
time every reasonably adequate method of preparation will 
have to be utilized. 
The Foundation, through the International Health Board, 
aids many forms of special public health training. During

staff were allowed leave for study in schools of hygiene 
and at field training centers; a few selected undergraduate 
medical students were employed during the summer in order 
to give them an idea of the nature of preventive work; small 
grants were made to help local institutes for health officers to 
secure lecturers of note from a distance; and a final appro- 
priation was made towards a demonstration of the feasibility 
of keeping local officers and personnel alert and currently 
informed by means of a correspondence course. 
MEDICAL EDUCATION IN MANY LANDS 
The Foundation’s interest in public health goes back in- 
evitably to medical education, for much as well-trained 
officials may accomplish, real success depends upon the 
medical profession as a whole. Unless the average practi- 
tioner can be imbued with the idea of the prevention of
-P-A-G-E-25
  
MEDICAL EDUCATION 25 
disease and led to regard himself more and more as a pro- 
moter of positive physical and mental well-being for both the 
individual and the community, the cause of public health and 
hygiene is doomed to fall short of its larger possibilities. 
Consider for a moment the dependence of preventive work 
upon the average doctor. The very bookkeeping of health, 
vital statistics, is a result of his knowledge and sense of duty. 
It falls to him ordinarily to report births, deaths, and certain 
communicable diseases. The statistics are valuable in pro- 
portion to his expertness and accuracy. It is his conscien- 
tiousness which chiefly determines the efficiency of control 
over such maladies as smallpox, diphtheria, scarlet fever, 
measles, tuberculosis, and venereal diseases. It is his atti- 
tude towards scientific knowledge and community co-opera- 
tion which vitally influences the views and conduct of his 
patients. The friends of public health are, therefore, inter- 
ested in medical education not only because it gives funda- 
mental training to future health officers, but even more 
because it prepares a profession which can largely make or 
mar the success of the preventive idea. 
But eagerness to emphasize this point of view in the under- 
graduate medical course has its dangers. An interest in 
public health can be effectively developed only as a part of a 
thoroughly organized, well-rounded professional training in 
the laboratory and dispensary and at the bedside. For 
example, control of communicable diseases presupposes a 
knowledge of bacteriology; personal hygiene is based upon a 
scientific physiology ; maternity welfare is directly related to 
the state of development of obstetrics; the prevention of 
infantile and children’s diseases is measured by the progress 
of pediatrics. It follows then that the demand for “the 
permeation of the medical curriculum with the preventive 
idea” is based upon the assumption that there exists a cur- 
riculum of the right sort to be permeated. 
Viewed internationally, medical education necessarily 
displays certain common ideas and procedures. But wide 
variations are also revealed. In one group of countries early 
   
-P-A-G-E-26
  26 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
access for the student to sick people in large numbers is 
deemed of first importance. In other places, preliminary 
practical individual training under whole-time teachers in 
dissecting-room and laboratories is regarded as essential. 
There are also differences in preliminary education, length of 
the course, and types of organization. In one case the in- 
dividuality of the institute or the clinic is conspicuous; in 
another the unity of the school as a whole is emphasized. 
So, too, with respect to the teaching of medicine, pediatrics, 
surgery, and obstetrics, 
plans and methods are 
very different. They 
vary from entrusting 
the work on the one 
hand to busy practi- 
tioners to insisting, on 
the other, that leadership 
at least be vested in men 
who devote themselves 
exclusively to the care

a ATRS Ee ee ee ee TheRockefeller Foun- 
dation, through its Di- 
vision of Medical Education, seeks to be of service in 
promoting the growth of effective medical education in 
influential centers in various countries. It offers no one 
model for universal imitation; it has no inflexible program. 
It recognizes that each type of medical school has developed 
under certain conditions, racial, economic, governmental, 
social. It has responded to the needs and demands of its 
environment. Obviously each country has something to 
contribute to a common fund of scientific knowledge and 
practical experience. The Foundation seeks to promote 
interchange of ideas (see page 46) by which each nation 
may improve its institutions at the same time that it puts 
its own characteristic gains at the service of other lands.           
-P-A-G-E-27
  MEDICAL EDUCATION 27 
From this process certain commonly accepted ideas tend 
gradually to emerge. The Foundation helps to give wider 
currency and effectiveness to such principles and methods. 
During 1925 support was given either in the form of aiding 
new projects or in fulfilment of previous pledges to medical 
schools in Edinburgh, Cambridge, Brussels, Strasbourg, 
Utrecht, Copenhagen, Beirut, Montreal (Université de 
Montréal), New York (Columbia University), Philadelphia 
(University of Pennsylvania), Iowa City (State University of 
Iowa), Sao Paulo, Brazil, Singapore (King Edward VII Col- 
lege of Medicine), and Bangkok, Siam. The aid varied 
from rather modest grants to substantial appropriations. 
The funds thus expended amounted to approximately 
$3,000,000. In every case the Foundation’s contribution 
was supplemented by funds from other sources. In addition, 
visits and surveys of medical schools were made in ten dif- 
ferent countries (see page 51). 
FROM EMERGENCY TO DEVELOPMENT 
IN EUROPE 
The aid to medical education reported in the preceding 
paragraph may be described as constructive. It represents a 
permanent gain in buildings and equipment or in endowment 
orin both. Ordinarily the Foundation refrains from making 
emergency gifts. In cases of earthquakes and great fires, 
floods, and famines, relief is a special responsibility of the 
Red Cross and similar agencies. These societies either 
maintain or can quickly mobilize organizations for collecting 
funds and supplies and sending these to the point of need. 
Except during the War the Foundation has not given money 
for purposes such as these. The response of the public al- 
most never fails to be sufficient. A Foundation gift might 
easily merely take the place of funds which would otherwise 
come from individuals. 
But within the special field of the Foundation there devel- 
oped during the past five or six years in countries of Central 
and Eastern Europe, and to some extent throughout the
-P-A-G-E-28

Continent, emergencies which could not be consistently 
ignored. In addition to laboratories and hospitals, perma- 
nent equipment, professional staff, other personnel and general 
maintenance funds, a medical center which is to do effective 
teaching and research must have these essentials: (1) im- 
portant books and journals which report the progress of the 
medical sciences in 
the leading, coun- 
tries; (2) new special 
apparatus and cur- 
rent laboratory sup- 
plies, i. e., glassware, 
chemicals, experi-

abroad through 
visits of professors and migrations of advanced students. 
It was precisely those essentials which were seriously 
threatened in the countries which had been isolated by the 
War and in which collapse of currencies and economic distress 
had reduced salary and maintenance funds of medical centers 
almost to the point of disaster. Through its Division of 
Medical Education, the Foundation began in 1920 a program 
of temporary emergency relief. This has included: (1) the 
gift of scientific journals and books chiefly in the English 
language (see page 48); (2) funds for laboratory supplies, 
usually at first administered by local committees; (3) resident 
fellowships, i. e., stipends and sometimes additional literature 
and supplies to enable young scientists to continue their 
 
-P-A-G-E-29
  MEDICAL EDUCATION 29 
studies in their home countries; and (4) foreign fellowships 
for work abroad (see page 46) and provision for visits of 
professors (see page 47). 
With gradually improving conditions it has been possible 
to begin a transition from a policy of emergency relief to a 
plan of developmental aid. Appropriations for literature are 
being reduced as medical schools are able to assume more of 
its cost. In some cases larger sums are being given for back 
files of journals with the understanding that current support 
from the Foundation will be withdrawn in the early future. 
As to laboratory supplies, these will cease to be provided for 
general institutional purposes but will be given for the special 
use of certain returned fellows, or put at the disposal of in- 
dividual department chiefs in selected institutions. In the 
same way resident fellowships will gradually be transformed 
into stipends for assistants whom such chiefs select for their 
staffs. 
Thus the characteristic feature of the developmental pro- 
grams will be not generalized assistance but the concen- 
tration of stipends and supplies in certain medical school 
departments whose leaders have shown their ability to con- 
tribute to the progress of science and to train men in research 
and teaching. For a time such aid is likely to be almost 
wholly limited to the laboratory subjects. In the future this 
policy may well lead to constructive projects of a more signifi- 
cant and permanent kind. 
PEKING UNION MEDICAL COLLEGE 
CARRIES ON 
A Westerner is likely to ask: “Ts it not almost impossible to 
conduct a medical school in a country like China distracted 
by civil war, strikes, and political agitation?’”’ On the other 
hand a teacher returning from Peking reports surprise and 
concern among the Chinese over the prevalence of banditry 
in the cities of the United States! Much depends on the 
point of view. Asa matter of fact, China’s very backward- 
ness is in times of stress a source of strength. There is so
-P-A-G-E-30
  30 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
little centralization, political, industrial, or commercial, that 
conditions which in a Western country would cause paralysis 
are in China largely localized in their effects. The areas 
occupied by armies are, of course, disturbed; strikes and boy- 
cotts have their influence; but elsewhere the common daily 
life goes on normally. Family control, guild comradeship, 
community justice, sacrosanct traditions, and coercive. cus- 
toms insure a fairly orderly existence. 
So during 1925 the Peking Union Medical College carried 
on almost as usual. It is true that there was some interrup- 
tion of examinations in June, but the work was made up in 
the autumn. There were times of anxiety about the supply 
of coal which comes by rail, but the fires under the boilers 
never failed for lack of fuel. The number of students who 
entered in October was reduced not so much, it is believed, by 
difficulties of travel as by lack of family funds. A summer 
school for science teachers in which the College had an in- 
terest was given up because the preliminary registration 
seemed too small to insure success. The Chinese colleges 
especially did not have the funds with which to send their 
teachers. 
The College is a unique item in the program of the Founda- 
tion, the only case in which complete responsibility has been 
assumed for the building, staffing, and temporary mainte- 
nance of an institution. Elsewhere there has always been a 
sharing of tasks with government or university which has 
carried the chief burden of cost and the whole duty of ad- 
ministration. But in China there were no suitable agencies 
of this kind. So, through a specially created subsidiary, the 
China Medical Board, the Foundation took over a school 
which had been co-operatively organized by certain mission- 
ary societies, British and American. A complete new es- 
tablishment of laboratories, hospitals, staff-houses, service 
buildings, together with plants for providing water, electric 
light and power, and gas was built; a staff of full-time 
teachers, administrators, nurses, technicians, orderlies, and 
service personnel was recruited, and work was begun in 
 
-P-A-G-E-31

graduate and undergraduate medical education, in nurse 
training, and in the preparation of students for admission to 
both the medical course and the school of nursing. 
From the outset the Foundation made clear that its pur- 
pose was not to create a permanently foreign institution in

China, but to transform the College gradually into a Chinese 
medical center with a Chinese staff and ultimately a Chinese 
board of trustees in complete control. It was recognized 
that this transition would have to be made slowly and care- 
fully, as Chinese doctors and others proved themselves 
capable of caring for patients, teaching students, carrying on 
research, and doing administrative work. 
The results of this policy have begun to show. In 1920, of 
a teaching staff of thirty-one the Chinese numbered nine, or 
29 per cent; in October, 1925, the percentage of Chinese was 
53. More significant still is the fact that Chinese doctors 
now occupy positions of leadership in two departments.
-P-A-G-E-32
  32 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
One of the two or three most important posts in the 
entire institution, that of medical superintendent of the 
Hospital, is efficiently filled by a capable Chinese. The atti- 
tude of a young Chinese doctor who was offered advancement 
to the headship of a department is worth recording. “If 
this offer is 
made,” he 
said, “be- 
cause of my 
ability as a 
scientist, I 
accept, but 
if promotion 
is proposed 
because Iam 
a Chinese, I 
must de

the valuable 
aid of an Advisory Committee of prominent Chinese citi- 
zens who are interpreting the work of the College to the 
people. The Committee also makes useful suggestions to the 
College and Hospital authorities. To some degree, these 
Chinese advisers play the part of local trustees. More- 
over, the institution from the beginning has frankly sought to 
put itself in harmony with the growing sense of nationality
-P-A-G-E-33
MEDICAL EDUCATION 33 
which beneath all superficial movements is the characteristic 
and enduring feature of the present situation. The College 
asked for and received government recognition as a condition 
of beginning work. While the institution maintains a de- 
partment of religious work under a Chinese Christian, no 
theological tests are applied to either faculty or students; no 
Biblical or religious courses or exercises are included in the 
requirements. 
In June, 1925, the premedical school ceased to exist. It 
was established as a temporary expedient to be given up as 
soon as a sufficient number of secondary schools and colleges 
were in a position to give satisfactory preparation in mathe- 
matics, physics, chemistry, biology, and English. Progress 
in both Chinese and foreign schools justifies the College in 
turning over this duty to other institutions. A special ar- 
rangement has been made with Yenching University—a for- 
eign institution in the suburbs of Peking—to take over cer- 
tain equipment and to assume teaching responsibility for 
preparing medical students and giving a preliminary training 
to nurses. 
The setting up in co-operation with the College of a health 
center under local auspices in Peking serves at least two im- 
portant purposes. It affords a demonstration for the first 
time in China of a modern health organization with its clinic, 
records, visiting nurse service, and educational features, and 
it provides a means of giving medical undergraduates a much 
needed practical training in the meaning and methods of 
public health and preventive medicine. 
The statistical facts about the College may be given in 
summary form. As of June 30, 1925, the members of the 
medical faculty and their assistants numbered eighty-seven, 
of whom, as has already been mentioned forty-six, or 53 
per cent, were Chinese. The teachers are graduates of 
thirty-one medical schools and represent ten different coun- 
tries. There were besides five teachers in the School of 
Nursing. There were also three visiting professors, two 
Americans and one Chinese. The student enrollment totaled 
 
-P-A-G-E-34
  34 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
195, distributed as follows: Medical School, fifty-seven ; School 
of Nursing, undergraduate students twenty, graduate stu- 
dents eleven; graduate and special students, both Chinese 
and foreign, 107. During the teaching year 1924-1925 
eighty-four doctors and nurses, Chinese and foreign, were 
registered for either regular work or in short intensive courses 
on small grants from the China Medical Board. 
The China Medical Board, in addition to maintaining the 
Peking Union Medical College, continued contributions to 
the medical schools of Shantung Christian University and the 
Hunan-Yale institution at Changsha, aided ten premedical 
courses, and assisted nineteen hospitals in various parts of the 
country. Minor items of aid and service are reported on 
page 51. 
THE NURSE, THE HOME, THE HOSPITAL, 
AND THE HEALTH SERVICE 
There has already been mention of the nurse in this Review. 
She plays an essential part in organized public health work; 
she is indispensable in the teaching hospital. And just now 
she is a storm center. Discussion, animated, sometimes ex- 
cited, busies itself with questions of her training, qualifica- 
tions, fields of work, hours, pay, motives, attitude. Physi- 
cians complain that she is hard to lure to the bedsides of 
private patients, that she is too often overtrained in theory, 
unduly professionalized, lacking in practicality and docility. 
Families find fault with the amount of her salary, the limita- 
tion of her hours, and her unwillingness to lend a hand in 
domestic tasks. Few people of modest means can afford to 
have her at all. 
The hospitals, too, cherish a grievance. They give her a 
sound training only to see her desert the wards to do public 
health nursing, school nursing, industrial hygiene work, and 
the like. Some of the smaller hospitals especially are quite 
bitter about this exodus. One of the most frequent com- 
plaints has to do with educational requirements. These are 
declared to be uselessly high, too theoretical and professional, 
 
-P-A-G-E-35

and a chief cause of keeping numbers low and costs high. 
All the plaintiffs tend to picture the nurse as something of a 
profiteer who has lost the Florence Nightingale spirit of 
sacrifice and service. 
What has the defendant, the graduate registered nurse, to 
say about these indictments? Here are some of the things 
she believes ought to be considered. Her education has cost 
her time and some money—actually a substantial sum if what 
she might have been earning in other work is taken into ac- 
count. After 
anelementary 
school course, 
and often one 
or more years 
of highschool, 
she has spent 
three years 
in a hospital.

cheap terms. 1°? 
When she has finished her course she feels that she has 
the right to choose between continuing in hospital service 
and entering the fields of private nursing or salaried public 
health or institutional nursing. 
From this point she can hardly be described in the singular. 
A good many nurses fall into hospital routine and remain in 
spite of often rather irksome conditions of work, residence, 
and discipline. They cannot agree that the pay is excessive 
when their hospital duties and responsibilities towards pupil 
nurses are fairly appraised. Large numbers take private

periods of unemployment, many times in a sense of being in- 
effectively utilized or even superfluous. Here, too, the ac-

alert young 
women with initiative, imagination, and a liking for respon-

public health service. Here they find continuous income, 
fixed hours, independence in personal living, and the satisfac- 
tion of giving well-organized aid and protection to large 
groups of needy and appreciative people. As to the Florence 
Nightingale spirit, the nurses admit that they are human, 
are not uninfluenced by the standards of living, dress, recre- 
ation, conduct, and personal ideals of their environment. 
Yet they are sincere in believing that in the mixture of 
motives by which they are actuated there is a steady current 
of sympathy and of loyalty to a high purpose. If they lack 
something of the devotion of the religious orders, it seems 
only fair to point out that society has not provided modern 
nurses with what these orders guarantee, support for active 
life and an old age of peace and security. 
As in every case of clashing interests each group seems 
justified from its own standpoint. Attempts to fix blame 
 
-P-A-G-E-37
NURSE TRAINING 37 
lead as usual to more heat than light. Certain facts emerge 
more or less clearly from the turmoil. There are too few 
nurses. The cost of private nursing service is prohibitive to 
people of small, or even moderate, means. Hospitals, es- 
pecially the smaller ones, have more and more difficulty in 
recruiting pupil nurses and in retaining competent graduates. 
Nursing service is too uniformly standardized to be used 
effectively and economically. Acute and complicated cases 
require a very different kind of nursing frem.that which 
suffices for mild or chronic ones. Often domestic aid is the 
primary need, with some incidental and simple attendance on 
the sick. But it must be remembered that becoming a 
nurse is still a voluntary step. Young women cannot be 
conscripted or evangelized or hypnotized into a nursing 
career. It must be made reasonably attractive to suitable 
types in competition with other opportunities which society 
has to offer. 
Fortunately, committees which include doctors, nurses, 
and lay people are beginning to study the problem with open- 
mindedness and good will. They are making studies of the 
actual facts; they are considering the classification of nurses 
into three or even four kinds with appropriate training for 
each; they are discussing changes in the curriculum, better 
and more economical organization of nursing service both in 
the home and in the hospital, the more effective utilization of 
public health nurses, and means of making the nursing career 
more desirable. In all this the Rockefeller Foundation takes 
a deep interest, but it has no panacea to offer, no special 
program to impose. 
AID FOR THE TRAINING OF LEADERS IN NURSING 
Whatever the solution of the nursing problem, one thing 
seems certain. There will, in any event, be a need for able 
and thoroughly trained women as administrators, teachers, 
and supervisors. The rank and file may include distinct 
grades, e.g., registered nurse, household nurse, even aide or 
attendant, each appropriately prepared; but the officers for 
   
-P-A-G-E-38
  38 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
these privates must have a superior and special education. 
It is this training of leaders in countries in which co-operation 
in public health or medical education or both is being given 
that primarily appeals to the Foundation. 
Ordinarily, except in cases of wide sectional differences, aid 
is confined to one government or university school in a given 
country. Assistance takes several forms: contingent gifts 
towards buildings and equipment, contributions, usually in 
decreasing annual sums to current budgets over a series 
of years, fellowships for persons of exceptional ability (see 
page 47), and study visits abroad for selected administrators. 
While the Foundation realizes that a uniform program which 
fails to reckon with widely varying conditions in different 
countries cannot wisely be urged, it does not seem worth 
while to help a school which cannot from the outset guarantee 
a certain minimum standard of preliminary education, in- 
structing staff, curriculum, teaching facilities, and living con- 
ditions for pupils. 
During 1925 the Foundation in conformity with this policy

-P-A-G-E-39
  BIOLOGICAL STUDIES 39 
supported a School of Nursing in the Peking Union Medical 
College; contributed to the budget of the Yale University 
School of Nursing, which now grants the degree of Bachelor 
of Nursing to university matriculants who complete success- 
fully a combined five-year course in the science curriculum 
and in nursing education; made similar grants to Vanderbilt 
University and the George Peabody College for Teachers, 
Nashville, Tennessee, which jointly conduct a hospital and 
public health nursing course; pledged $130,000 towards a 
nurses’ home project and contributed to the teaching budget 
of a Brazilian government school of nursing in connection with 
the Hospital Geral de Assistencia in Rio de Janeiro; and 
aided the same sort of plan for building and maintenance at 
the Cracow University School of Public Health and Bedside 
Nursing in Poland. 
In addition to this characteristic program a variety of ap- 
propriations, large or small, for nursing service or education 
were made in connection with different phases of the Foun- 
dation’s work. Thus aid was given to the Public Health 
Nursing Service of the Brazilian Department of Health in 
Rio de Janeiro and to the Bureau of Public Health Visiting, 
France. Minor forms of help were rendered to the Salpé- 
triére School in Paris, the Charité School in Lyon, the Uni- 
versity College Hospital School in London, the Nursing 
School in Zagreb, Yugoslavia, and that of the Elizabeth 
Sleeper Davis Memorial Hospital, Peking. The co-opera- 
tion in nurse training during the year also included the sup- 
port of seventy fellowships from thirteen different countries 
(see page 46), and the financing of international visits by 
nine leaders (see page 47), and of two studies of special 
problems in nurse service and training. 
“‘THE PROPER STUDY OF MANKIND IS MAN’”’ 
It has been said that in creating science human searchers 
began with the distant stars and only of late have come to 
man himself. There were good reasons why this should be 
 
-P-A-G-E-40
  40 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
so. Comte offered an explanation in what he called the 
“hierarchy of the sciences.”’ Bodies of knowledge, he said, 
fall into a natural order of increasing complexity. Mathe- 
matics as a method and tool 
comes first. Then follows 
physics which rests upon math- 
ematics. After physics, and 
dependent upon it, chemistry 
appears. Until physics and 
chemistry have reached a cer- 
tain stage of development the 
general science of life, biology, 
is hampered in its growth. In 
the same way, psychology rests 
on biology, while sociology, 
the most intricate of all, can ad- 
vance only as all the preceding 
sciences become more exact 
and authentic. This does not 
mean, of course, that the sci- 
ences have developed histori- 
; cally in any such formal fashion, AUSTRALIAN Native DecoraTED FoR only that no one of them can

make important progress until 
its immediate predecessor in the scale has provided the 
necessary facts and laws. 
Medicine, both curative and preventive, whether it be 
considered as science or art, quite obviously depends directly 
on psychology, biology, chemistry, and physics. The dis- 
covery of microbes, for example, created a new biological 
science, bacteriology, which radically modified medical ideas 
and procedures. Later, the progress of chemistry in its 
relation to organic life had a profound influence on knowledge 
of the body and its processes. Now it is realized that the 
modern science of the mind, psychology, must be taken 
systematically into account by the medical scientist and 
the physician. So the Rockefeller Foundation has naturally,   
        
 
-P-A-G-E-41
  BIOLOGICAL STUDIES 41 
if not inevitably, been drawn into at least the borders 
of the fields of biology and psychology, as these have a 
bearing on medicine and public health, and on man’s 
development. 
During 1925, through the Division of Studies, the Founda- 
tion aided both the American and the Canadian committees 
for mental hygiene which are concerned with the relations of 
psychology to mental diseases, their treatment and pre- 
vention. Grants were made to the University of Iowa for 
research in brain physiology and its application to certain 
problems of mental defects in children. Support was con- 
tinued for forty-one fellowships in biology administered by 
the National Research Council. The sum of $50,000 was 
appropriated towards new buildings for the Marine Biological 
Station at Pacific Grove, California. Funds were also sup- 
plied for a biological abstract service which is described 
in another section (see page 45). 
In the field of human biology, under which may be in- 
cluded physiology, psychology and psychiatry, and anthro- 
pology both physical and cultural, as these throw light 
on man’s body, mind, and social relations, significant 
beginnings were made. Contribution was given towards 
the support of an Institute of Biological Research at 
the Johns Hopkins University, which has chosen as one of 
its leading problems studies in the duration of life in selected 
insects, other animals, and in man. Another project from 
which valuable results are expected is a study at Yale Uni- 
versity of the growth, diseases, behavior, intelligence, and pos- 
sible means of communication of primates. Four young chim- 
panzees have been under observation during the past year 
in a special laboratory. The funds which enable the Depart- 
ment of Psychology to carry on this work are supplied by 
the Foundation through the Division of Studies. 
RACIAL LABORATORIES OF THE PACIFIC 
The investigator in human biology proper must rely on 
observations and comparisons, for quite obviously he cannot

in the case of human groups resort to experiment. He must 
study societies as they exist, preferably in relatively primitive 
and simple forms and so far as possible in isolation from one 
another. From this point of view the complaint of a zealous 
anthropologist against missionaries is at least understandable. 
He said that they confuse social and cultural conditions and 
make the work of the sociological student harder. But 
under certain circumstances a mixture of races affords just 
the opportunity 
which the investiga- 
tors of heredity, of 
racial interbreeding, 
and of cultural inter- 
action are seeking. 
There are many 
things which the 
scientists want to 
know about the so- 
called primitive 
' peoples. | Measure- Torem TREE AND NArtyEs Reavy ror Totem ments of heads and 
bodies are import- 
ant; the constitution of the blood, the processes of nutrition, 
and other physiological facts are significant; susceptibility 
to communicable diseases throws light on problems of 
natural or acquired immunity; general intelligence as tested 
by ability to solve life problems, to record and use knowledge 
and experience, etc., has a bearing on the whole subject of 
human psychology; that elusive something called tempera- 
ment has meaning for science; social organization for 
leadership and control is full of interest; handicrafts, tools, 
ornaments, customs, legends, music, ceremonies, religion, 
repay the most careful study; attempts to discover the 
causes of individual and group survival or decay are of 
value; and not the least is the desire to get evidence about 
the migration and distribution of races. 
The islands of the Pacific offer exceptional advantages for   
 
-P-A-G-E-43
  BIOLOGICAL STUDIES 43 
investigating racial and social problems. The Polynesian 
people in Hawaii, Samoa, the Marquesas, the Society 
Islands, Ellice Islands, ete., will repay continued study. 
The Melanesians in the Admiralty Islands, Bismarck Archi- 
pelago, Solomon Islands, New Hebrides, Fiji, and other 
islands offer a wide and fruitful field for investigation. Cer- 
ta‘n aboriginal groups in Australia represent one of the few 
examples of people in an early stage of development. Hawaii 
is a unique center for the investigation of racial crossing, 
cultural interaction, and social relationships. These various 
opportunities are not permanent. Some of the peoples are 
disappearing, others are being rapidly Westernized. If 
further and more systematic studies are to be made, too 
much time must not be lost. 
Australia, which under the League of Nations holds man- 
dates for the more important of the Melanesian Islands, is 
following an enlightened policy in training administrators for 
these areas. A department of anthropology has been estab- 
lished in the University of Sydney. Here, in addition to 
research, special courses will be given for government officials 
to prepare them to deal intelligently and sympathetically 
with the native peoples. In time this should result not only 
in the protection of the Melanesians but in adding to our 
knowledge of their characteristics and social life. The 
Australian aborigines, who constitute a quite separate prob- 
lem, are also to be studied by members of the staffs of Austra- 
lian universities. The Foundation, through the Division of 
Studies, has pledged funds for co-operation with the agencies 
which will make these investigations, has provided special 
trips for two professors from Sydney and Adelaide, and has 
sent representatives on study visits to Hawaii, New Zealand, 
and Australia (see page 51). 
A WORLD MEMORY FOR BIOLOGY 
The interest of the Foundation in biology as fundamental 
to medicine, hygiene, and the study of human individuals and

groups has already been described. One special form of aid 
to the progress of biology calls for separate notice. The 
enormous number of scientific papers and volumes published 
annually throughout the world in every field of research 
creates the 
need for some 
nif fae sn ae irl dove tegatana * kind of sys- 
tematic or-

knowledge 
which bears upon a given problem can be quickly assembled. 
Just as the well-trained and informed scholar can concentrate 
his own knowledge and experience on a new situation, so so- 
ciety as a whole may be thought of as utilizing its memory 
through the organized resources of its libraries and museums. 
But each library after all is only a section of a national and
-P-A-G-E-45
    
BIOLOGICAL STUDIES 45 
of a world memory or brain. The books and periodicals on 
its shelves come from all lands where new truth is discovered 
and then described in print. Thus in the field of biology 
alone it is estimated that each year 40,000 articles of at least 
some value appear in 5,000 journals, transactions of scientific 
societies, proceedings of congresses, and the like. To be 
sure, these papers vary enormously in their importance. 
Probably in a given year only a small percentage is highly 
significant in fundamental ways. The bulk of them perhaps 
deal with useful details. A good many are likely to be 
trivial if not negligible. Yet if a scientific worker is to avoid 
duplicating the research of others, if he is to compare his 
methods with theirs, if he is to have his mind steadily fer- 
tilized by relevant ideas and suggestions, if he is to increase 
the chance of getting a happy illuminating flash upon his 
problems, he must have constant access to the world 
memory. 
To meet this need abstract journals which give the gist of 
articles and papers have appeared in different countries. 
Elaborate indexes make reference easy and accurate. Some 
of the journals have attained international standing. Bi- 
ology as a whole, however, has lacked satisfactory service of 
a world-wide sort. Recently eighteen American biological 
societies joined in a plan to publish a journal of biological 
abstracts on an international basis. The co-operation of 
individuals and organizations in foreign countries is being 
sought and in most cases secured. The National Research 
Councils of Japan and of Australia have responded warmly. 
The Royal Society of London and the French Federation of 
Natural Science Societies have expressed an interest. Ar- 
rangements for exchange of material with abstract journals 
in Europe are being worked out. 
The details of the new plan have been carefully studied. 
Eighty sections of subject matter will be handled by eighty 
special editors. Co-operating foreign correspondents and 
libraries will help to scan the 5,000 serials for significant 
papers. Authors and editorial collaborators will prepare the  
-P-A-G-E-46
    46 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
abstracts. By the use of a thin opaque paper 1,030 large 
pages of small but legible type will occupy only an inch of 
shelf room. When once under way it is expected that twelve 
monthly numbers with elaborate annual indexes will run to 
between 3,000 and 3,500 pages. The entire enterprise will 
be directed by a small full-time central staff of editors. The 
University of Pennsylvania provides headquarters free of 
charge, while the Marine Biological Laboratory at Woods 
Hole offers summer offices on the same generous terms. In 
addition to the contributions of the American societies and 
the income from subscriptions, the Rockefeller Foundation 
has pledged $350,000 to be spent over a ten-year period 
towards the cost of this plan to provide.a world memory 
for biology. 
INTERNATIONAL TRADE IN MEN 
AND IDEAS 
Aid to Biological Abstracts is in harmony with a guiding 
policy which leads the Foundation to encourage in many 
ways a constant exchange of knowledge and suggestion 
among the various countries of the world. This commerce 
of ideas, unhampered by tariffs, is carried on through per- 
sonal intercourse and printed page. Thus the Foundation 
stations representatives in foreign countries, grants fellow- 
ships for graduate study, invites individuals and commis- 
sions to make study trips to countries other than their own, 
sends visiting professors abroad, distributes bulletins of 
information about medical education, supplies in emer- 
gencies scientific literature to medical libraries, and main- 
tains a steady volume of international correspondence about 
public health, medical education, nurse training, and allied 
subjects. 
During the year 1925 the Foundation, through its own or 
other agencies, contributed to the maintenance of 842 fellow- 
ships, held by representatives from forty-four different coun- 
tries. Of these fellowships, 365 were foreign, ie., their
-P-A-G-E-47

holders crossed national boundaries. Of the remainder, 
twenty-nine were held by Americans studying in the United 
States, 404 were resident fellowships for graduate study, 
and forty-four were emergency resident scholarships for 
certain tem- 
porary needs.

regarded as an end in themselves but as means of construc- 
tive aid. They are granted only to selected individuals of 
unusual promise for special professional training in prepara- 
tion for officially guaranteed administrative, research, or 
teaching positions in government or university services. 
The total sum spent upon fellowships in 1925 was $792,655. 
International commissions and individual guests during 
1925 included: eleven health officers from Canada, Trinidad, 
Porto Rico, Austria, Denmark, the Irish Free State, and 
Ceylon; eight representatives of medical schools from Brazil, 
France, and Siam; and nine leaders in nurse training from 
England, Canada, the United States, Rumania, Bulgaria, 
Yugoslavia, and Austria. In addition, two visiting professors 
were sent to Peking Union Medical College. In connection 
with this subject of international intercourse it is pertinent 
   
-P-A-G-E-48
  48 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
to add that for a number of years the Foundation, through 
the International Health Board, has contributed substan- 
tially to the interchanges of health officers which are organ- 
ized by the Health Committee of the League of Nations. 
In 1925 under League auspices 128 medical officers from 
fifty-eight different countries participated in these inter- 
changes and similar meetings. It thus appears that during

the year nearly 600 specialists went from one country to 
another either wholly or chiefly with the aid of Foundation 
funds. 
The Division of Medical Education issued in 1925 another 
bulletin belonging to the series ‘‘ Methods and Problems of 
Medical Education,” (Vol. III). This contains descriptions 
of medical school departments written by professors of 
twelve medical schools in seven different countries. The 
articles, illustrated with building plans and photographs, 
describe the housing, equipment, staff, curricula, and 
methods of research and teaching. The publication went 
out to all the 460 medical schools of the world and to many 
individual scientists and administrators. In connection with 
the emergency program in Europe (see page 28) medical

literature was sent to 112 medical faculties in twenty 
countries. 
RESEARCH UNDER FOUNDATION AUSPICES 
The prosecution of research is not ordinarily a direct 
activity of the Foundation. In certain fields of medicine and 
hygiene investigation is a special function of the Rockefeller 
Institute for Medical Research which is a quite distinct and 
separate organization with its own trustees and endowment. 
Indirectly, it is true, Foundation funds are being used to 
promote research in schools of hygiene, medical schools, 
university departments of biology, psychology, and anthro- 
pology, or under the auspices of special committees or com- 
missions. Throughout this Review frequent mention has 
been made of aid to institutions or groups which are adding to 
the sum of scientific knowledge. 
In connection with the work of the Foundation, however, a 
good deal of original investigation of specific problems is 
being carried on either by staff members themselves or by 
men working in schools, institutes, or university departments. 
Thus in 1925, under the auspices of the International Health 
Board, studies were made of the life histories of hookworm 
eggs and larvae, and of growth retardation in school children 
harboring varying numbers of the mature parasites. Another 
important inquiry threw more light upon the use of a certain 
drug (carbon tetrachloride) in the treatment of hookworm 
disease. At the Board’s training base in Alabama still other 
inquiries were made into the pollution of soils of different 
kinds, the effectiveness of various sanitary measures, and 
the like. In this way improvements in methods of control 
were introduced. 
So also with respect to malaria more facts were brought to 
light. The breeding and behavior of malaria mosquitoes in 
Brazil were carefully observed. Experiments with bird 
malaria—the discovery by Ross of the transmission of this 
disease by anopheline mosquitoes led to the knowledge of 
how human malaria is spread—were carried on with the hope 
 
-P-A-G-E-50
  50 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
of gaining further insight into the malaria problem. Other 
researches had to do with laboratory tests for discovering 
latent malaria in human beings and with the possibility of 
re-enforcing quinine with more effective substances. At the 
training bases in Georgia and Alabama field studies of mos- 
quito breeding and of various means of preventing it under 
different conditions were continued to good purpose. Refer- 
ence has been made (see page 18) to the field studies in 
yellow fever which are being conducted by a special com- 
mission on the West Coast of Africa. 
Under the auspices of the Division of Studies an inquiry 
was made into the problem of maternity care in England and 
on the Continent with the aim of getting information about 
the European midwife system and of learning, if possible, 
why American maternal deaths in child-bearing are twice 
what they are in England and three times as great as in the 
Netherlands and Denmark. While the visits of representa- 
tives to European countries, the Pacific Islands, Australasia, 
and the Far East to make studies of health conditions, medi- 
cal schools, university departments of biology, etc., cannot be 
strictly regarded as scientific research, much important in- 
formation was secured in this way. 
CONSULTATION AND FIELD SERVICE 
Health departments and medical schools often require the 
temporary services of experienced specialists to aid them in 
reorganizing or expanding their programs. The loan of such 
experts or the provision of small appropriations to permit the 
establishment of new lines of work which will later be adopted 
into the regular budget of the state or institution, are forms 
of assistance which the Foundation is frequently called upon 
to render. 
During 1925 the International Health Board, through 
service of this kind, aided in the development of public health 
laboratory facilities in twelve states of the United States and 
in six foreign countries. In the same way assistance was 
given in strengthening systems of vital statistics and disease
-P-A-G-E-51
  WORKING WITH OTHER AGENCIES 51 
reporting or in furthering sanitary engineering projects in 
thirteen states of the United States and in two Central Ameri- 
can republics. 
The General Director and other officers of the Board made 
surveys and visits of inspection in the United States, Europe, 
and the Far Kast. In Czechoslovakia, France, and Hungary 
aid was given to temporary advisory bureaus which are 
studying or reorganizing the national health services. 
Representatives of the Division of Medical Education 
made studies of the needs of individual medical schools in five 
countries of Europe and five countries of the Far East. 
The Division of Studies made a survey of negro nurse 
training in the United States which included a comprehensive 
study of all the important schools for negro nurses and of the 
work of these women in public health. Observations were 
made in sixteen cities. The Director of the Division, ac- 
companied by scientists distinguished in the fields of anthro- 
pology and biology, visited Japan, China, Hawaii, New Zea- 
land, and Australia to investigate possible fields for studies 
in human biology. The China Medical Board conducted an 
architectural bureau in connection with the Peking Union 
Medical College, where advice on laboratory and hospital 
construction could be had. 
WORKING WITH OTHER AGENCIES 
In addition to its co-operation with governments and in- 
stitutions for medical training, the Foundation gives as- 
sistance to a number of voluntary agencies equipped to do 
certain specialized work in public health, medical education, 
and allied fields. There follows a list of such organizations 
receiving aid during 1925: 
Medical Research Council (Great Britain). Fellowships in 
medicine. 
The National Research Council. Fellowships in mathemat- 
ics, medicine, physics, chemistry, and the biological 
sciences; contribution towards current expenses of Con-

APPLICATIONS FOR AID 
In 1925 the Foundation was obliged to decline formal ap- 
plications for aid to the number of 631, inasmuch as the types 
of assistance requested did not fall within the scope of its 
activities as determined by its present policies. The Foun- 
dation does not make gifts or loans to individuals, nor 
 
-P-A-G-E-53
  BY-PRODUCTS OF TEAM-WORK 53 
contribute to the building or maintenance of churches, hos- 
pitals (except as certain hospital features may be included in 
plans for medical education), and other local institutions, nor 
support campaigns to influence public opinion on social or 
political questions. A record is kept of all applications 
formally refused by the officers or the Executive Committee, 
and these are regularly reported to the trustees; but the 
names of the applicants and the details of their requests 
are not made public. 
The applications declined during 1925 may be classified 
under the following headings: public health 17, medical edu- 
cation 156, general education 68, local institutions 120, 
personal aid 193, miscellaneous 77. This list does not 
include the many tentative requests for co-operation made 
to the central office or to staff officers in the field. 
BY-PRODUCTS OF TEAM-WORK 
In this story of international co-operation in research, 
medical education, public health, and the development of the 
biological sciences, the reader may have missed familiar 
allusions to mutual understanding, good will, and world-wide 
peace. This reticence is due to no lack of interest in these 
things but rather to the belief that they are by nature pecu- 
liarly elusive when directly and consciously pursued. Like 
culture, refinement, good taste, esprit de corps, they seem to 
be precious by-products rather than ends in themselves. 
Leaving to others the purposeful promotion of amity among 
the nations, the Rockefeller Foundation fixes attention upon 
common interests of all peoples, in the development of science 
and its application to health and welfare. By fostering inter- 
course among scientists through travel and print, by helping 
each nation to put its characteristic contributions at the 
service of all, by deepening the conviction that there are 
great causes in which all have equal concern, by helping to 
make co-operation and comradeship easy and habitual, the 
Rockefeller Foundation seeks in its chosen field to realize the 
   
-P-A-G-E-54
    
54 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
purpose of its Charter, “the well-being of mankind through- 
out the world.” 
FINANCES FOR 1925 
In the accompanying table is presented a summary of the 
receipts and expenditures for 1925. The income accruing 
from investments was $8,237,303; the balance carried over 
from 1924 was $7,611,793. Of these total funds, $9,113,730 
was needed to meet the obligations which came due during 
the year and $6,170,047 was subject to call in fulfilment of 
outstanding pledges. The remainder available for transfer 
to the 1926 budget and subject to appropriations for that year 
was $565,319. Details of expenditure for 1925 will be found 
on pages 55 and 56 of this Review. A more complete financial 
statement will appear in the Annual Report of the Founda- 
tion for 1925, which will be published later in the year. A 
copy of this report will be sent to anyone applying for it.

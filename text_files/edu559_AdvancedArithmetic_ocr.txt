PREFACE 
Tue need felt for an advanced text-book in arithmetic 
that shall develop fundamental principles and at the same 
time include the essentials of commercial practice is re- 
sponsible for the appearance of this book. The author 
believes that mental training is an important feature in 
the study of arithmetic, but:that the study need lose none 
of this training by the introduction of practical business 
methods. Consequently, throughout the work, the aim 
has been not only to develop the principles of the subject, 
both by means of demonstrations and exercises, but also 
to employ such methods and short processes as are used 
in the best commercial practice, and to exclude cumber- 
some methods and useless material. 
The book is intended for pupils who have completed 
the grammar school work in arithmetic, and contains 
abundant material for a review and advanced course. 
The exercises have been selected largely from actual 
business transactions. A few have been taken from 
standard foreign works. 
Brief historical notes are occasionally inserted in the 
hope that they will be of interest and value. 
The author is indebted to several friends, who, after 
careful reading of manuscript, or proof sheets, or both, 
have offered valuable suggestions.

ADVANCED ARITHMETIC 
NOTATION AND NUMERATION 
1. Our remote ancestors doubtless did their counting 
by the aid of the ten fingers. Hence, in numeration it 
became natural to divide numbers into groups of tens. 
This accounts for the almost universal adoption of the 
decimal scale of notation. 
2. It is uncertain what the first number symbols were. 
They were, probably, fingers held up, groups of pebbles, 
notches on a stick, ete. Quite early, however, groups of 
strokes I, Il, Ill, Illl, «.-, were used to represent numbers. 
3. The earliest written symbols of the Babylonians 
were cuneiform or wedge-shaped symbols. The vertical 
wedge (|!) was used to represent unity, the horizontal 
wedge (—~) to represent ten, and the two together (/—) 
to represent one hundred. Other numbers were formed 
from these symbols by writing them adjacent to each other. ~ 
Thus. 
‘ W=14+14+1=3, 
—!] =104+104+141=22, 
—J— = 10 x 100=1000, 
e Wre—l! = 5 x 100+ 10 + 2 = 512.

-P-A-G-E-8
  8 NOTATION AND NUMERATION 
To form numbers less than 100 the symbols were placed 
adjacent to each other and the numbers they represented 
were added. ‘To form numbers greater than 100 the sym- 
bols representing the number of hundreds were placed 
at the left of the symbol for one hundred and used as a 
multiplier. 
4. The Egyptians used hieroglyphies, pictures of objects, 
or animals that in some way suggested the idea of the 
number they wished to represent. Thus, one was repre- 
sented by a vertical staff (1), ten by a symbol shaped like 
a horseshoe (0), one hundred by a short spiral (¢_), one 
hundred thousand by the picture of a frog, and one million 
by the picture of a man with outstretched hands in the 
attitude of astonishment. They placed the symbols adja- 
cent to each other and added their values to form other 
numbers. Thus, eo1=1004+10+1=111. The Egyp- 
tians had other symbols also. 
5. The Greeks used the letters of their alphabet for 
number symbols, and to form other numbers combined 
their symbols much as the Babylonians did their wedge- 
shaped symbols. 
6. The Romans used letters for number symbols, as 
follows: 
1 5 10 50 100 500 1000 
I Vv x L Cc D M 
Numbers are represented by combinations of these sym- 
bols according to the following principles: 
(1) The repetition of a symbol repeats the value of the 
number represented by that symbol; as, II=3, XX=20. 
(2) The value of a number is diminished by placing 
a symbol of less value before one of greater value; as, 
 
-P-A-G-E-9
  NOTATION AND NUMERATION 9 
IV=4, XL=40, XC=90. The less number is sub- 
tracted from the greater. 
(8) The value of a number is inereased by placing a 
symbol of less value after one of greater value, as XI=11, 
CX =110. The less number is added to the greater 
number. 
(4) The value of a number is multiplied by 1000 by 
placing a bar over it, as C= 100,000, X = 10,000. 
7. Among the ancients we do not find the character- 
istic features of the Arabic, or Hindu system where each 
symbol has two values, its intrinsic value and its local value, 
i.e. the value due to the position it occupies. Thus, in the 
number 513 the intrinsic value of the symbol 5 is five, its 
‘local value is five hundred. Written in Roman notation 
518 =DXIII. In the Roman notation each symbol has 
its intrinsic value only. 
8. The ancients lacked also the symbol for zero, or the 
absence of quantity. The introduction of this symbol 
made place value possible. 
9. With such cumbersome symbols of notation the an- 
cients found arithmetical computation very difficult. In- 
deed, their symbols were of little use except to record 
numbers. The Roman symbols are still used to number 
the chapters of books, on clock faces, ete. ‘ 
10. The Arabs brought the present system, including 
the symbol for zero and place value, to Europe soon after 
the conquest of Spain. This is the reason that the nu- 
merals used to-day are called the Arabic numerals. The 
Arabs, however, did not invent the system. They received 
it and its figures from the Hindus.
-P-A-G-E-10
  10 NOTATION AND NUMERATION 
11. ‘The origin of each of the number symbols 4, 5, 6, 7, 
9, and probably 8 is, according to Ball, the initial letter of 
the corresponding numeral word in the Indo-Bactrian al- 
phabet in use in the north of India about 150 B.c. 2 and 3 
were formed by two and three parallel strokes written 
cursively, and 1 by a single stroke. Just when the zero 
was introduced is uncertain, but it probably appeared 
about the close of the fifth century A.p. The Arabs 
called the sign 0, sifr (sifra=empty). This became the 
English eipher (Cajori, “History of Elementary Mathe- 
matics”). 
12. The Hindu system of notation is capable of uniimited 
extension, but it is rarely necessary to use numbers greater 
than billions. 
18. In the development of any series of number sym- 
bols into a complete system, it is necessary to select some 
number to serve as a base. In the Arabic, or Hindu system 
ten is used as a base; ¢.e. numbers are written up to 10, 
then to 20, then to 30, and so on. In this system 9 digits 
and 0 are necessary. If five is selected as the base, but 
4 digits and 0 are necessary. If twelve is selected, 11 
digits and 0 are necessary. 
The following table shows the relations of numbers in 
the scales of 10, 5, and 12. (¢ and e are taken to represent 
ten and eleven in the scale of 12.)

ber grouped into periods of three figures each? Read it. 
5. If 4 is annexed to the right of 376, how is the value 
of each of the digits 3, 7, 6 affected? if 4 is annexed to 
the left? if 4 is inserted between 3 and 7? 
6. What is the local value of each figure in 76,345?

-P-A-G-E-12
ADDITION 
14. If the arrangement is left to the computer, numbers 
to be added should be written in columns with units of 
like order under one another. 
15. In adding a column of given numbers, the computer 
should think of results and not of the numbers. 
  He should not say three and two are five and one are six 329 
and four are ten and nine are nineteen, but simply five, six, 764 
ten, nineteen, writing down the 9 as he names the last num- 221 
ber. The remaining columns should be added as follows: 9642 
three, seven, nine, fifteen, seventeen, writing down the 7; 7823 
nine, fifteen, seventeen, twenty-four, twenty-seven, writing 18779 
down the 7; nine, eighteen, writing down the 18. Time in 211 
looking for errors may be saved by writing the numbers to 
be carried underneath the sum as in the exercise. 
16. Checks. If the columns of figures have been added 
upward, check by adding downward. If the two results 
agree, the work is probably correct. 
Another good check for adding, often used by account- 
ants, is to add beginning with the left-hand column. 
16000 or 16 
Thus, the sum of the thousands is 16 thou- 2600 26 
sands, of the hundreds 26 hundreds, of the tens 160 16 
16 tens, and of the units 19 units. 19 venlg

ADDITION 
  2. Why should digits of like order be placed in the 
same column? State the general principle involved. 
3. Why should the columns be added from right to 
left ? Could the columns be added from left to right and 
a correct result be secured? What is the advantage in 
beginning at the right ? 
4. In the above exercise, why is 1 added (“carried”) 
to the second column? 1 to the third column? 2 to the 
fourth column ? 
17. Accuracy and rapidity in computing should be re- 
quired from the first. \Accuracy can be-attained by acquir- 
ing the habit of always checking results. Rapidity comes 
with much practic 
18. The 45 simple combinations formed by adding con- 
secutively each of the numbers less than 10 to itself and 
to every other number less than 10 should be practiced till 
the student can announce the sum at sight. These com- 
binations should be arranged for practice in irregular order 
similar to the following: 
Poe goe eR 1 ace Ff 28 4 
meee re eo oe ae 
Go Gk D8: Me. 62 TOR 8 6K 
ee ee ee ae ee 
ee, 64 8 8 ed

19. Rapid counting by ones, twos, threes, etc., up to nines 
is very helpful in securing both accuracy and rapidity. 
Fr. Begin with 4 and add 6's till the result equals 100. 
Add rapidly, and say simply 4, 10, 16, 22, - - -, 94, 100.

20. It is helpful also to know combinations, or groups 
Wied oe8i iS that form certain numbers. Thus, 9 8 7. 6.5 and 
256166 6.4 
12 2 8 4 8 38, etc., are groups that form 10, and 
Dee 2.8 
2.9.99. 8.8 8-7 
9 8 7 6 8 7 6 T are groups that form 20. 
Pane e0e 4 0. 6.76 
21. Such groups should be carefully studied and prac- 
ticed until the student readily recognizes them in his 
work. He should also familiarize himself with other 
groups. The nine-groups and the eleven-groups are easy 
to add, since adding nine to any number diminishes the 
units’ figure by one, and adding eleven increases the units’ 
and the tens’ digits each by one.

1. Begin with 8 and add 7’s till the result is 50. 
2. Begin with 3 and add 8’s till the result is 67.

Exercises for further practice in addition can be readily supplied 
by the teacher. The student should be drilled till he can add accu- 
rately and rapidly. Accuracy, however, should never be sacrificed to 
attain rapidity. — 
Expert accountants, by systems of grouping and much practice, 
acquire facility in adding two or even three columns of figures at a 
time. Elaborate calculating machines have also been invented, and 
are much used in banks and counting offices. By means of these 
machines, columns of numbers can be tabulated and the sum printed 
by simply turning a lever. 
 
-P-A-G-E-17
SUBTRACTION 
22. In subtraction it is important that the student should 
be able to see at once what number added to the smaller 
of two numbers of oné figure each will produce the larger. 
Thus, if the difference between 5 and 9 is desired, the 
student should at once think of 4, the number which 
added to 5 produces 9. 
23. Again, if the second number is the smaller, as in 
7 from 5, the student should think of 8, the number 
which added to 7 produces 15, the next number greater 
than 7 which ends in 5. 
24. The complete process of subtraction is shown in the 
following exercise : 
9534 7 and 7 are 14, carry 1. (Why carry 1?) 
5627 3 and 0 are 3. 
—— 6and 9 are 15, carry 1. 
200% 6 and 2 are 8, 
25. The student should think “ What number added to 
5627 will produce 8534?” After a little practice, it is 
unnecessary to say more than 7 and 7, 8 and 0, 6 and 9, 
6 and 2, writing down the underscored digit just as it is 
named. 
26. Check. To check, add the remainder and the sub- 
trahend upward, since in working the exercise the numbers 
were added downward.

  18 SUBTRACTION 
27. The above method of subtraction is important not 
only because it can be performed rapidly, but because it 
is very useful in long division. It is also the method of 
“making change” used in stores. 
28. There are two other methods of subtraction in 
common use. The processes are shown in the following 
exercises : 
(1) 643 = 600 + 40 + 3 = 500 + 130 + 13 
456 = 400 +50+6=400+ 50+ 6 
187 = Le SLOOP) 80-Fa7, 
6 from 13, 7; 5 from 13, 8; 4 from 5, 1. 
(2) 643 = 600 + 40 + 8, 600 + 140 +13 
456 = 400 + 50 +6, 500+ 604+ 6 
AS iia 100+ 80+ 7 
6 from 13, 7; 6 from 14, 8; 5 from 6, 1. 
EXERCISE 4 
1. Define the terms subtrahend, minuend, difference. 
2. How should the terms be arranged in subtraction ? 
Where do we begin to subtract? Why? 
3. Is the difference affected by adding the same number 
to both subtrahend and minuend? Is this principle used 
in either (1) or (2)? 
4. If a digit in the minuend is less than a digit of the 
corresponding order in the subtrahend, explain how the 
subtraction is performed in both (1) and (2). 
29. Arithmetical Complement. The arithmetical com- 
plement of a number is the difference between the number 
and the next higher power of 10. Thus, the arithmetical 
complement of 642 is 858, since 358+ 642=1000. The 
arithmetical complement of 0.34 is 0.66, since 0.66 + 0.34 
=1,

EXERCISE 5 
1. Name rapidly the complements of the following 
numbers: 75, 64, 32, 12, 90, 33, 25, 0.25, 0.16, 125, 500, 
5000, 1250, 625. 
2. Name the amount of change a clerk must return if 
he receives a five-dollar bill in payment of each of the 
following amounts: $1.25, $8.75, $2.34, $3.67, $0.25, 
$0.88, $4.91, $1.85. 
3. Name the amount of change returned if the clerk 
receives a ten-dollar bill in payment of each of the follow- 
ing amounts: $7.34, $3.42, $9.67, $5.25, $2.67, $6.45, 
$4.87, $0.68, $3.34. 
Determine in each of the following exercises what num- 
ber added to the smaller number will produce the larger. 
The student will notice that in some cases the subtrahend 
is placed over the minuend. It is often convenient in 
business to perform work in this way.

SUBTRACTION 21 
The preceding form represents the account of John Smith with the 
First National Bank from Aug. 8 till Nov. 25. The items at the left 
of the central dividing line are the amounts that the bank owes Mr. 
Smith. This side is called the debit side of the account. The items 
at the right represent the amounts withdrawn by Mr. Smith. This 
side is called the credit side of the account. The difference between 
the sums of the credits and the debits is called the balance of the 
account. 
It is evident that the debit side of the above account is greater 
than the credit side. Therefore, to balance the account, add the 
debit side first, and then subtract the sum of the credit side from the 
result, as in Ex. 17 above. The difference will be the balance, or the 
amount left in the bank to the credit of Mr. Smith. The work can 
be checked by adding the balance to the credit column. ‘The result 
should equal the sum of the debit column.

MULTIPLICATION 
31. The multiplication table should be so well known 
that the factors will at once suggest the product. Thus, 
7 x 6, or 6 x T, should at once suggest 42. 
82. The student should also be able to see at once what 
number added to the product of two numbers will produce 
a given number. Thus, the number added to 4 x 9 to 
produce 41 is 5, or 4 x 9 and 5 are 41. 
It is a common practice in multiplication to write the multiplier 
first as 2x $5= $10. In this case the sign (x) is read “times.” 
If the multiplier is written after the multiplicand, as in $5 x 2 = $10, 
the sign (x) is read “ multiplied by.” The multiplier is always an 
abstract quantity (Why ?), but the multiplicand may be either abstract 
or concrete. : 
33. The following examples show the complete process 
of multiplication : 
Ev. 1. Multiply 2743 by 356. 
    Solution. In multiplying one number by 2743 2743 
another it is not necessary to begin with the 356 356 
units’ digit of the multiplier. We may begin 16458 8229 
with either the units’ digit or the digit of the 13715 18715 
highest order. In fact, it is frequently of de- 999 16458 
cided advantage to begin with the digit of 979593 
highest order, especially in multiplying deci- 
mals; but care should be taken in placing the right-hand figure of 
the first partial product. Since 3 hundred times 3 units = 9 hundred, 
the 9 must be put in the third or hundreds’ place, etc.

MULTIPLICATION 23 
Er. 2, Multiply 3.1416 by 26.34. 
Solution. In beginning the multiplication we see that 
20 x 0.0006 = 0.012. Hence the 2 is written in the thou- 3.1416 
sandths’ place. The work is then completed as indicated 26.34, 
in the annexed example. It will readily be seen that the 62.832 
rest follows after pointing off the first partial product 18.8496 
correctly. 94248 
The advantage of beginning with the digit of the 125664 
highest order is seen in approximations (see p. 59), S5rqosaq 
where considerable work is thereby saved. Seen 
34. Check. Multiplication may be checked by using 
the multiplicand as the multiplier and performing the 
multiplication again. However, the check by “casting 
out the nines” (p. 41), is more convenient.

4. How should the terms be arranged in multiplication ? 
Does it make any difference in what order we multiply by 
the digits of the multiplier? Might we begin to multiply

5. How is the order of the right-hand figure of each 
partial product determined ? 
6. How does the presence of a zero in the multiplier 
affect the work ? 
7. In multiplying 3.1416 by 26.34, can we tell at once 
how many integral places there will be in the product? 
Can we tell the number of decimal places ?

35. The following short methods are useful: 
1. To multiply any number by 5, 25, 162, 334, 125. 
Since 5 = 4, to annex a cipher and divide by 2 is the same as to 
multiply by 5. The student in a similar manner should explain short 
processes of multiplying by 25, 163, 334, 125. 
2. To multiply any number by 9. 
Since 9 = 10 — 1, it is sufficient to annex a cipher to the number 
and subtract the original number. 
Ex. Multiply 432 by 9. 
432 x 10 = 4320 
432 x 1= 482 
432 x 9 = 3888 
8. To multiply any number by 11. 
Since 11 = 10 + 1, it is sufficient to annex a cipher to the number 
and add the original number. 
Hx. Multiply 237 by 11. 
237 x 10 = 2370 
23 Kyla ae 
237 x 11 = 2607 
This result can readily be obtained by writing down the right-hand 
figure first and then the sums of the first and second figures, the sec- 
ond and third, etc., and finally the left-hand figure. 
4. To multiply any number by a number differing but 
little from some power of 10. 
Annex as many ciphers to the number as there are ciphers in the 
next higher power of 10, and subtract the product of the number 
multiplied by the complement of the multiplier.

ending with 1. 
Multiply by the tens’ figure of the multiplier, writing this product 
under the number one place to the left. 
Ex. Multiply 245 by 71.

36. In division the student should be able to see at 
once how many times a given digit is contained in any 
number of two digits with the remainder. Thus, 7 is 
contained in 46, 6 times with a remainder 4. The student 
should think simply 6 and 4 over.

59046 remainder 3. 
The whole mental process should be 5 and 5, 9 and 0, 0 and 2, 
4 and 3, 6 and 3. 
Two interpretations arise from considering division as the inverse 
of multiplication. 
Thus, since 4 x $6 = $24. : 
(1) $24+4= $6, separation into groups. $24 has been separated 
into 4 equal groups.

abridged by omitting the partial products and writing 
down the remainders only. These remainders are ob- 
tained by the method used in Ex. 18, p. 26. 
Ex. Divide 764.23 by 2.182. 
The work will be simplified by multiplying both numbers by 1000 
to avoid decimals. The first remainder, 1246, is obtained as follows:

  FACTORS AND MULTIPLES 
42. A factor or divisor of a number is any integral 
number that will exactly divide it. 
43. A number that is divisible by 2 is called an even 
number, and one that is not divisible by 2 an odd number. 
Thus, 24 and 58 are even numbers, while 17 and 83 are odd numbers. 
44. A number that has no factors except itself and 
unity is called a prime number. 
Thus, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, ete., are prime numbers. 
45. Write down all of the odd numbers less than 100 
and greater than 3. Beginning with 3 reject every third 
number ; beginning with 5 reject every fifth number; 
beginning with 7 reject every seventh number. The 
numbers remaining will be all of the prime numbers 
between 8 and 100. (Why ?) 
46. This method of distinguishing prime numbers is called the 
Sicve of Eratosthenes, from the name of its inventor, Eratosthenes 
(276-196 B.c.). He wrote the numbers on a parchment and cut out 
the composite numbers, thus forming a sieve. 
47. A number that has other factors besides itself and 
» unity is called a composite number. 
48. Numbers are said to be prime to each other when no 
number greater than 1 will exactly divide each of them. 
Are numbers that are prime to each other necessarily 
prime numbers ? 
32
-P-A-G-E-33
FACTORS AND MULTIPLES 33 
49. An integral number that will exactly divide two or 
more numbers is called a common divisor, or a common 
factor of these numbers. 
Thus, 2 and 3 are common divisors of 12 and 18, 
50. The greatest common factor of two or more num- 
bers is called the greatest common divisor (g.c.d.) of the 
numbers. 
Thus, 6 is the g.c.d. of 12 and 18, 
51. A commbn multiple of two or more numbers is a 
number that is exactly divisible by each of them. 
Thus, 12, 18, 24, and 48 are common multiples of 3 and 6, while 12 
is the least common multiple (1.c.m.) of 3 and 6. 
52. It is of considerable importance in certain arith- 
metical operations, particularly in cancellation, to be able 
readily to detect small factors of numbers. In proving 
the tests of divisibility by such factors, the two following 
principles are important. 
1. A factor of a number is a factor of any of its 
multiples. 
Proof. Every multiple of a number contains that number an exact 
number of times; therefore, it contains every factor of the number. 
Thus, 5 is a factor of 25, and hence of 3 x 25, or 75. 
2. A factor of any two numbers is a factor of the sum or 
difference of any two multiples of the numbers. 
Proof. Any factor of two numbers is a factor of any of their mul- 
tiples by Principle 1. Therefore, as each multiple is made up of parts 
each equal to the given factor, their sum or difference will be made up 
of parts equal to the given factor, or will be a multiple of the given 
factor. 
Thus, 8 is a factor of 12 and of 15, and hence of 5 x 12 + 2 x 15, 
or 90. 3 is also a factor of 5 x 12 —2 x 15, or 30.

53. Tests of Divisibility. 1. Any number is divisible by 
2 of the number represented by its last right-hand digit is 
divisible by 2. 
Proof. Any number may be considered as made up of as many 
10’s as are represented by the number exclusive of its last digit plus the 
last digit. Then, since 10 is divisible by 2, the first part, which is a 
multiple of 10, is divisible by 2. Therefore, if the second part, or the 
number represented by the last digit, is divisible by 2, the whole 
number is. 
Thus, 634 = 63 x 10 + 4 is divisible by 2 since 4 is.

2. Any number is divisible by 4 if the number represented 
by the last two digits is divisible by 4. 
Proof. Any number may be considered as made up of as many 
100’s as are represented by the number exclusive of its last two digits 
plus the number represented by the last two digits. Then, since 100 is 
divisible by 4, the first part, which is a multiple of 100, is divisible 
by 4. Therefore, if the number represented by the last two digits is 
divisible by 4, the whole number is. 
Thus, 85648 = 856 x 100 + 48 is divisible by 4 since 48 is. 
8. Any number is divisible by 5 if the last digit is 0 or 5. 
The proof, which is similar to the proof of 1, is left for the student. 
Note. 0 is divisible by any number, and the quotient is always 0. 
4. Any number is divisible by 8 if the number represented 
by its last three digits is divisible by 8. 
The proof is left for the student. 
5.. Any number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is 
divisible by 9. 
Proof. Since 10=9 +1, any number of 10’s = the same number 
of 9’s + the same number of units; since 100= 99 + 1, any number 
of 100’s = the same number of 99’s + the same number of units; since 
 
-P-A-G-E-35
  
  ‘FACTORS AND MULTIPLES 385 
1000 = 999 + 1, any number of 1000’s = the same number of 999’s 
+ the same number of units; etc. Therefore, any number is made up 
of a muitiple of 9 + the sum of its digits, and hence is divisible by 9 
if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9. 
Thus, 7362 =7 x 1000+3 x 100+6 x 10+2 
=7(999 +1) +8(99+1)+69+4+1)4+2 
=7x9994+3x99+6x9+74+34642 
=a multiple of 9 + the sum of the digits. 
Therefore, the number is divisible by 9 since 7+38+6+2=18 is 
divisible by 9. 
6. Any number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is 
divisible by 3. 
The proof, which is similar to the proof of Principle 5, is left for the 
student. 
7. Any even number is divisible by 6 if the sum of its digits 
is divisible by 8. 
The proof is left for the student. 
8. Any number is divisible by 11 df the difference between 
the sums of the odd and even orders of digits, counting from 
units, is divisible by 11. 
Proof. Since 10 =11—1, any number of 10’s = the same number 
of 11’s— the same number of units; since 100=99+41, any number of 
100’s = the same number of 99’s + the same number of units; since 
1000 = 1001 —1, any number of 1000’s = the same number of 1001’s 
—the same number of units; etc. Therefore, any number is made 
up of a muitiple of 11 + the sum of the digits of odd order — the sum 
of the digits of even order, and hence is divisible by 11 if the sum of 
the digits of odd order — the sum of the digits of even order is divis- 
ible by 11.

54. Relative Weight of Symbols of Operation. In the 
use of the symbols of operation (+, —, X, +), it is impor- 
tant that the student should know that the numbers con- 
nected by the signs x and + must first be operated upon 
and then those connected: by + and —; for the signs of 
multiplication and division connect factors, while the signs 
of addition and subtraction connect terms. Factors must 
be combined into simple terms before the terms can be 
added or subtracted. 
Thus, 5+2x3—15+5+4=12, the terms 2 x 3 and 15 +5 being 
simplified before they are combined by addition and subtraction. 
55. The ancients had no convenient symbols of operation. Addi- 
tion was generally indicated by placing the numbers to be added adja- 
cent to each other. Other operations were written out in words. The 
symbols + and — were probably first used by Widmian in his arithmetic 
published ‘in Leipzig in! 1489. He used them to mark excess or defi- 
ciency, but they soon came into use as symbols of operation. x asa 
symbol of multiplication was used by Oughtred in 1631. The dot (-) 
for multiplication was used by Harriot in 1631. The Arabs indicated 
division in the form of a fraction quite early. + as a symbol of divi- 
sion was used by Rahn in his algebra in 1659. Robert Recorde intro- 
duced the symbol = for equality in 1557. : was used to indicate 
division by Leibnitz and Clairaut. In 1631 Harriot used > and < 
for greater than and less than. Rudolff used y/ to denote square root 
“in 1526. 
56. Greatest Common Divisor. In many cases the g.c.d. 
of two or more numbers may readily be found by factoring, 
as in the following example:

38 FACTORS AND MULTIPLES 
Fx. Find the g.c.d. of 3795, 7095, 30030. 
8795 = 3 x 5 x 11 x 23, 
7095 = 3x 5 x 11 x 43, 
80030 =2x3x5x 11x 91, 
and since the g.c.d. is the product of all of the prime factors that are 
common to the three numbers, it is 3 x 5 x 11 = 165. 
57. Euclid, a famous Greek geometer, who lived about 300 z.c., 
gave the method of finding the g.c.d. by division. This method is 
useful if the prime factors of the numbers cannot be readily found. 
Ex. Find the g.c.d. of 877 and 1479. 
1479 377 |: ce The g.c.d. cannot be greater than 377, and since 
348 | 1 348 377 is oe eee of 1479, it is not the g.c.d. of the 
29 | 12| 348 two numbers. 
Divide 1479 by 377. Then, since the g.c.d. is a common factor of 
377 aud 1479, it is a factor of 1479—3 x 377, or 348 (Principle 2, p. 33). 
Therefore, the g.c.d. is not greater than 348. If 348 is a factor of 
377 and 1479, it is the g.c.d. sought. 
But 348 is not a factor of 877. Therefore, it is ne the g.c. d. sought. 
Divide 377 by 348. Then, since the g.c.d. is a factor of 377 and 
348, it is a factor of 377 — 348, or 29 (Principle 2, p. 33). 
Therefore, the g.c. d. is not greater than 29, and if 29 is a factor of 
348, 377, and 1479, it is the g.c.d. sought. (Why?) 
29 is a factor of 848. Therefore, it is a factor of 377 and of 1479. 
(Why?) 
Therefore, 29 is the g.c.d. sought. 
58. Least Common Multiple. In many cases the |. c.m 
of two or more numbers may readily be found by factoring, 
as in the following example. 
Ex. Find the 1. c.m. of 414, 408, 3330. 
414=2x3x3x 93, 
408 =2x2x2x3x17, 
3330 =2x3x3x5x 37.
-P-A-G-E-39
    _ FACTORS AND MULTIPLES 39 
The ].c.m. must contain all of the prime factors of 414, 408, 3330, 
and each factor must occur as often in the l.c.m. as in any one of the 
numbers. Thus, 3 must occur twice in the l.c. m., 2 must occur three 
times, and 23, 17, 5, 37 must each occur once. 
Therefore, the Lc.m.=2x2x2x3x38x5x 23x 17 x 87= 
5208120. 
59. When the numbers cannot readily be factored, the 
g.c¢.d. may be used in finding the 1. c. m. 
Since the g. ¢. d. of two numbers contains all of the fac- 
tors that are common to the numbers, if the numbers are 
divided by the g.c.d., the quotients will contain all the 
factors that are not common. The 1. c. m. is therefore the 
product of the quotients and the g.c. d. of the numbers. 
Ex. Find the 1. c.m. of 14482 and 32721. 
The g.c.d. of 14482 and 32721 is 13. 
14482 +13=1114. .. the l.c.m. of the two numbers is 
1114 x 32721 = 36451194.

  CASTING OUT NINES 
60. The check on arithmetical operations by casting 
out the nines was used by the Arabs. It is a very useful 
check, but fails to detect such errors as the addition of 9, 
the interchange of digits, and all errors not affecting the 
sum of the digits. (Why?) 
The remainder arising from dividing any number by 9 is 
the same us that arising from dividing the sum of its digits 
by 9. 
Thus, the remainder arising by dividing 75234 by 9 is 3, the same 
as arises by dividing 7+5+4+2+43+4 by 9. 
The student should adapt the proof of Principle 5, p. 34, to this 
statement. 
61. The most convenient method is to add the digits, 
dropping or “casting out” the 9 as often as thé sum 
amounts to that number. 
Thus, to determine the remainder arising from dividing 645738 by 
9, say 10 (reject 9), 1, 6, 13 (reject 9), 4, 7, 15 (reject 9), 6. There- 
fore, 6 is the remainder. After a little practice the student will easily 
group the 9’s._ In the above, 6 and 3, 4 and 5, could be dropped, and 
the excess in 7 and 8 is seen to be 6 at once. 
62. Checic on Addition by casting out the 9’s. 
Ex. Add 56342, 64723, 57849, 23454 and check the 
work by casting out the 9’s. 
a : 40
-P-A-G-E-41
CASTING OUT NINES 41 
Since each number is a multiple of 9 plus some remainder, the 
numbers can be written as indicated 
56342 =9 x 6260+ 2rem. in the annexed solution. : 
64723 =9x 7191+ 4 rem. 
57849=9x 6427+ Grem. But 12=943. 
23454=9 x 2606+ Orem. =. 202368 = 9 x 224844943 
202368 = 9 x 22484 + 12 rem. =9 x 22485 +3. 
Thus, the excess of 9’s is 8 and the excess in the sum of the ex: 
cesses, 2, 4, 6, and 0, is 3, therefore the work is probably correct. 
63. The proof may be made general by writing the numbers in 
the form 9z2+7r. This can be done since all 
ae me numbers are multiples of 9 plus a remainder. 
ie hope Hence, by expressing the numbers in this form 
and adding we have for the sum a multiple of 9 
plus the sum of the remainders. Therefore, the 
excess of the 9s in the sum is equal to the excess in 
the sum of the excesses.

64. Check on Multiplication by casting out the 9’s. 
Since any two numbers may be written in the form 9%+7r and 
92'+7’, multiplying 92+r by 92 +r, 
  92 +r we haye 812r2'+9(2'r+2r')+r7. From 
9aitr this it is evident that the excess of 9’s in 
Dar’ +rr’ the product arises from the exeess in 17’. 
81 xe’ + 9a'r Therefore, the excess of 9’s in any product is 
81 ax! + 9(a'r + wr’) + rr! equal to the excess in the product found by 
multiplying the excesses of the factors together. 
Ex. Multiply 8764 by 456 and check by casting out 
oe 8764 x 456 = 1716384. 
The excess of 9's in 3764 is 2; the excess in 456 is 6; the excess in 
the product of the excesses is 3 (2 x 6=12; 12 —9=3); the excess 
in 1716384, the product of the numbers, is 3. Therefore, the work is 
probably correct. .

42 : CASTING OUT NINES 
    65. Check on Division by casting out the 9’s. 
Division being the inverse of multiplication, the dividend 
is equal to the product of the divisor and quotient plus the 
remainder. Therefore, the eacess of 9's in the dividend is 
equal to the excess of 9's in the remainder plus the excess 
in the product found by multiplying the excess of 9s in the 
divisor by the excess of 9's in the quotient. 
Ex. Divide 74563 by 428 and check by casting out 
; the 9's. 74568 + 498 = 174 + 83s, 
or 74563 = 174 x 428 + 91 
    
  The excess of 9’s in 74563 is 7; in 174, 3; in 428,5; in 91,1. Since 
7, the excess of 9’s in 74563 = the excess in 8 x 5 + 1, or 16, which is 
the product of the excesses in 174 and 428 plus the excess in 91, the 
work is probably correct.

  FRACTIONS 
66. Historically the fraction is very old. A manuscript on arithme- 
tic, entitled “ Directions for obtaining a Knowledge of All Dark Things,” 
written by Ahmes, an Egyptian priest, about 1700 3.c., begins with 
fractions. In this manuscript all fractions are reduced to fractions 
with unity as the numerator. Thus, the first exercise is § = $+ 7s 
67. While the Egyptians reduced all fractions to those with con- 
stant numerators, the Babylonians used them with a constant de- 
nominator of 60. Only the numerator was written, with a special 
mark to denote the denominator. This method of writing fractions 
lacked only the symbol for zero and the substitution of the base 10 
for 60 to become the modern decimal fraction. Sexagesimal frac- 
tions are still used in the measurement of angles and time. 
68. The Romans used duodecimal fractions exclusively. They 
had special names and symbols for #,, 34,++ +, 34, dp ay, ete. To 
the Romans, fractions were concrete things. ‘They never advanced 
beyond expressing them in terms of uncia (,,), silicus (} uncia), 
scrupulum (,/, uncia), etc., all subdivisions of the as, a copper coin

69. The sexagesimal and duodecimal fractions prepared the way for 
the decimal fraction, which appeared in the latter part of the sixteenth 
century. In 1585 Simon Stevin of Bruges published a work in which 
he used the notations 7 4’ 6” 5'” 9”, or 7 4@ 6@ 5® 9@ for 7.4659. 
During the early stage of its development the decimal fraction was 
written in various other forms, among which are found the follow- 
Te UIeWntve al 20824 
ing: 7465 9,746 5 9, 7/4659, 7|4659, 7,4659. The decimal 
point was first used, in 1612, by Pitiscus in his trigonometrical tables : 
but the decimal fraction was not generally used before the beginning 
of the eighteenth century.

70. The primary conception of a fraction is one or several 
of the equal parts of a unit. Thus, the fraction 4 indicates 
that 4 of the 5 equal parts of a unit are taken. 
71. The term naming the number of parts into which 
the unit is divided is called the denominator. The term 
numbering the parts is called the numerator. 
72. A proper fraction is less than unity ; an improper 
fraction is equal to or greater than unity. 
73. A number consisting of an integer and a fraction is 
called a mixed number. 
74. Our conception of a fraction must, however, be 
enlarged as we proceed, and be made to include such ex- 
BoD tS? a 4y Z ™ 307 —7 3.14159. -., p etc. The more 
general conception of a fraction is that it is an indicated 
operation in division where the numerator represents the 
dividend and the denominator the divisor.

tion, as 0.5 means 33; or 4. Using the decimal point (0.5) 
is simply another way of writing 3. 
76. General Principles. Multiplying the numerator or 
dividing the denominator of a fraction by a number multt- 
plies the fraction by that number. 
Let } be any fraction where 7 represents the number of parts into 
which unity is divided, and 5 the number of these parts taken.

3 the number of equal parts into which unity is divided and there-

tor of a fraction by a number divides the fraction by that 
number.

(2) 4 = z +4, since multiplying the denominator by 4 multi- 
plies by 4 the number of parts into which unity is divided and there- 
fore the fraction is } as large as before. 
  78. Multiplying or dividing both numerator and de: 
nominator of a fraction by the same number does not change 
the value of the fraction. 
() ane == Multiplying both numerator and denominator by 
5 both multiplies and divides the value of the fraction by 5. The 
value of the fraction therefore remains unchanged. 
(2) : - 2 a . Dividing both numerator and denominator by 5 +O

tion and an improper fraction may be reduced to a mixed 
number or an integer.

fractions having a common denominator. 
Er. 1. Reduce }, 3, zy, to equivalent fractions having a 
commgn denominator. 
The l.c. m. of 4, 9, 12, is 36. 
«. #, #4, gs are fractions having a common 
denominator, equivalent to 3, 3, 4. Since 36 is 
the l. c. m. of 4, 9, 12, it is called the least common 
denominator. 
  82. Sometimes, instead of finding the l.c.m., it is more 
convenient to take as the common denominator the product 
of all the denominators and multiply each numerator by 
the product of all the denominators except its own. 
Ex. 2. Reduce }, § and 2 to fractions having a common

83. Addition and Subtraction of Fractions. Since only 
the same kinds of units, or the same parts of units, can be 
added to or subtracted from one another, it is necessary 
to reduce fractions to a common denominator before per- 
forming the operations of addition or subtraction.

84. Multiplication of Fractions. The product of two 
numbers may be found by performing the same operation on 
one of them as is performed on unity to produce the other. 
Thus, in 8 x 4 = 12, unity is taken three times to produce the mul- 
tiplier 8, hence 4 is taken three times to produce the product 12. 
Again, in 3 x } = }4, unity is divided into 3 parts and 2 of them are

He should never multiply or divide until all possible factors 
have been removed by cancellation. 
Nore. Although a knowledge of the principles of multiplication 
and division of decimals has been assumed in examples given before, 
it is well to review these principles at this point to make sure that 
they are thoroughly understood. 
Ex. 2. Multiply 0.234 by 0.16.

The number of decimal places in the product is the same as the 
number of zeros in the denominator of the product, that is, it equals 
the number of decimal places in the multiplicand plus the number in 
the multiplier. The decimal point in (0.03744) simply provides a 
convenient way of writing 34445. It is better, however, to determine 
the position of the decimai point before beginning the multiplication. 
This can be done by considering only the last figure at the right of 
the multiplier and multiplicand. Thus, we see that 0.004 x 0.06 = 
0.00024. “Hence, the order of the product will be hundred thousandths.

quently used in arithmetic. 
(1) Numbers that are equal to the same number are equal. 
to each other. 
Thus, if z=5andy=5,then«#=y. 
(2) If equals are added to equals, the sums are equal. 
Thus, if a2=5,04+38=543. 
(8) If equals are subtracted from equals, the remainders 
are equal. 
Thus, if a=4,thenz—2=4-2. 
(4) If equals are multiplied by equals, the products are 
equal. ® Thus, if ae 8, then z= 6. 
(5) If equals are divided by equals, the quotients are 
equal. 
Thus, if 8a = 6, then z = 2. 
87. Division of Fractions. Division may be regarded as 
the inverse of multiplication. The problem is, therefore, 
to find one of two factors when the product and the other 
factor are given. 
Thus, 38x4=12, ..12+3=4,and12+4=3. Axiom 5.

of the divisor. ;

If a number of factors are connected by the signs x and +, the 
operations are to be performed from left to Behh 
Thus, 8x 3+4x2+6=2. 
The operation indicated by the word “of” following a fraction is 
to be performed before the operations indicated by x and +. 
Thus, 3+4x fof 6+2-—¢+ fof = 19}. 
Observe that the operations } of 6 and $ of 2 are performed first, 
followed by multiplication and division from left to right, and finally 
by addition and subtraction. 
88. A fraction of the form # is called a complex frac- 
opie 
tion and may be considered as equivalent to 3+ % and 
treated as a problem in division. In general, however, a 
complex fraction may be more readily simplified by multi- 
plying both terms by the 1. c.m. of the denominators of 
the two fractions in the numerator and denominator.

The number of decimal’places in the quotient will equal the num- 
ber of zeros in the denominator of the last product. This will be the 
same as the number of zeros in the denominator of the dividend minus 
the number of zeros in the denominator of the divisor, or, what is the 
same thing, the number of decimal places in the dividend minus the 
number of decimal places in the divisor. 
If the number of decimal places in the dividend is less than the 
number of decimal places in the divisor, we may annex zeros to the 
dividend till the number of decimal places is the same in both divi- 
dend and divisor. The quotient up to this point in the division wil]

more zeros may be annexed to the dividend. The remaining figures

90. In scientific investigations exact results are rarely 
possible, since the numbers used are obtained by observa- 
tion or by experiments in which, however fine the instru- 
ment, the results are only approximate, and there is a 
degree of accuracy beyond which it is impossible to go. 
91. On the other hand, the approximate value of such 
incommensurable quantities as V2 = 1.414+, w= 3.14159+ 
can be obtained to any required degree of accuracy. The 
value of 7 has been computed to 707 decimal places, but 
no such accuracy is necessary or desirable. The student 
should always bear in mind that dé is a waste of time to 
carry out results to a greater degree of accuracy than the 
data on which they are founded. 
92. It is frequently necessary to determine the value of 
a decimal fraction correct to a definite number of decimal 
places. The value of 2$=0.95833+ correct to four deci- 
mal places is 0.9583. 0.958 and 0.96 are the values correct 
to three and two places. The real value of this fraction 
correct to four places lies between 0.9583 and 0.9584. 
0.9583 is 0.00003+ less than the true value, while 0.9584 
is 0.00006+ greater. Therefore 0.9583 is nearer the cor- 
rect value, and is said to be the value correct to four deci- 
mal places. Similarly, 0.96 is the value correct to two 
places. 
93. If 5 is the first rejected digit, the result will appar- 
ently be equally correct whether the last digit is increased 
by unity or left unchanged. The value of 0.4235 correct 
to three places may be either 0.423 or 0.424. However, 
as the 5 itself is usually an approximation, it can readily
-P-A-G-E-58
    58 FRACTIONS © 
be determined which course to pursue by noticing whether 
the 5 is in excess or defect of the correct value. 0.23649 
correct to four places is 0.2365, but correct to three places 
0.236 is nearer the true value than 0.237. 
94. Addition. Hr. Add 0.234678, 0.322135, 0.114342, 
0.563217, each fraction being correct to six decimal places. 
Solution. It is clear that the last digit in this sum is 
not correct, since each of the four numbers added may be 0.234673 
either greater or less than the correct value by a fraction 0.322135 
less than 0.0000005. Hence, the total error in the sum  0-114342 
cannot be greater than 0.000002. The required sum must 0.563217 
therefore lie between 1.234369 and 1.234365, and in either 1.934367 
case the result correct to five places is 1.23437.   
° 95. The next to the last digit in the sum may be incor- 
rect, as shown in the following example: 
Fx. Add 0.131242, 0.276171, 0.113225, 0.342247, each 
fraction being correct to six decimal places. : , 0.131242 
Solution. In this case the sum lies between 0.862887 9.976171 
and 0.862883. Hence, it is uncertain whether 0.86289 or 0.113225 
0.86288 is the value correct to five places. 0.8629 is, how- 9.349047 
ever, the value correct to four places.   
0.862885 
96. The third digit from the last may be left in doubt, 
as in the following example: 
Ex. Add 5.866314, 3.715918, 0.568286, 4.342233, each 
fraction being correct to six places. 
: 5.866314 Solution. Here the true value of the sum lies between 3.745918, 
14.492753 and 14.492749. Hence, it is uncertain whether 9 5gg086 
the value correct to four places is 14.4928 or 14.4927. The 4 349933

97. Subtraction. Hr. Subtract 0.238647 from 0.329528, 
each fraction being correct to six decimal places. 
Solution. Since each fraction cannot differ from the 0.329528 
true value by a fraction as large as 0.0000005, the differ- 0.238647 
ence cannot be greater or less than the correct value by a (),090881 
fraction as large as 0.000001. Hence, the difference must 
lie between 0.090882 and 0.090880, and the value correct to five places 
is 0.09088.   
98. Cases will arise where the second and third digits 
from the last are in doubt, as in addition. The student 
should determine how far the result may be relied upon 
in the following examples: 
(1) Subtract 0.371492 from 0.764237. 
(2) Subtract 0.11132 from 0.23597. 
(3) Subtract 15.93133 from 43.71288. 
99. Multiplication. From the examples in addition 
given above the student will notice that it will be suffi- 
cient in most cases to carry out the partial products 
correct to two places more than the required result. 
Ex. Find the square of 3.14159 correct to four decimal

completed. Multiplication by 4 would give a figure in the seventh 
place. Instead of writing down the figures we add the nearest 10 to 
the next column. , Thus, 4 times 9, 36, add 4 to the next column since 
3.6 = 4 approximately. 4 times 5, 20 and 4,24. 4 times 1,4 and 2, 
6, ete. 
In multiplying by the next 1 it is not necessary to take the 9 in the 
multiplicand into account. So, also, in multiplying by the 5, the 5 
and 9 in the multiplicand may both be ignored. And so on until the 
multiplication is completed. 
100. Division. Hv. Divide 9376245 by 3724 correct to 
the units’ place. 
Solution. The division in full and the contracted form are as 
follows :

3724 372 
29005 290 
26068 260 
2937 30 
The first two digits in the quotient are 2 and 5 and the second re- 
mainder is 662. It is not necessary to bring down any more figures 
to have a result correct to units since tens divided by thousands will 
give hundredths. The divisor may also be contracted at this stage of 
the work. Thus, cutting off the 4, 372 is contained once in the second 
remainder, 662. Cutting off the 2, 37 is contained 7 times in the next 
remainder, 290. This gives the units’ figure of the quotient. 
2517 
It will be noticed that the next figure of the quo- 3724)9376245

    MEASURES 
102. Measures of Weight. It is curious to note what an important 
part the grain of wheat or barley has played in the establishment of 
a unit of weight, both among the ancients and the more modern 
Europeans. In England, as early as 1266, we find the pennyweight 
defined as the weight of “32 wheat corns in the midst df the ear”; 
again about 1600, as “24 barley corns, dry and taken out of the middle 
of the ear.” Still later the artificial grain (4, pwt. Troy) is defined as 
“one grain and a half of round dry wheat.” The Greeks made four 
grains of barley equivalent to the keration or carob seed. From this 
is derived the carat, the measure by which diamonds and pearls are 
weighed. The grain of barley and the carat have been used by all 
European countries as the basis of existing weights. 
103. Great inconvenience was long experienced from this lack of 
uniformity, so that Parliament in 1824 passed an act adopting the 
Imperial Pound Troy as the standard of weight. It was also enacted 
that of the 5760 grains contained in the pound Troy, the pound avoir- 
dupois should contain 7000. The international kilogram is now the 
fundamental standard of weight in the United States. The pound 
avoirdupois is defined as , J, kilogram (see § 139). The ounce, grain, 
etc., are subdivisions of the pound. ; 
104. Avorrpurors WrIGuT 
16 drams (dr.) = 1 ounce (0z.) 
16 ounces = 1 pound (Ib.) 
100 pounds = 1 hundredweight (ewt.) 
2000 pounds = 1 ton (T.) 
112 Ib.=1 long ewt. and 2240 Ib. =1 long ton are used in the 
customhouse and in weighing coal and iron at the mines. 
The c in ewt. stands for the Latin word centum, a hundred. 
Lb. is a contraction of the Latin word libra, pound. 
Pound is from the Latin word pondus, a weight. 
Ounce is from the Latin word uncia, a twelfth part. 
Dram is from the Latin word drachma, a handful.

24 grains (gr.) = 1 pennyweight (pwt.) 
20 pennyweights = 1 ounce Troy 
12 ounces Troy = 1 pound Troy 
This weight is used for the precious metals and jewels. The ounce 
‘Troy and pound Troy must be carefully distinguished from the ounce 
and pound avoirdupois. The grain, however, is the same throughout. ° 
437.5 grains = 1 ounce avoirdupois 480 grains = 1 ounce Troy 
7000 grains = 1 pound avoirdupois 5760 grains ='1 pound Troy

38 scruples = 1 dram (dr. or 3) 
8drams = 1 ounce (oz. or 3) 
12 ounces = 1 pound 
5760 grains = 1 pound 
This table is used in compounding drugs and medicines. Scruple 
is from the Latin word serupulum, a small weight. 
Of the above measures of weight, avoirdupois is the most generally 
used. 
107. Measures of Length. The ancients usually derived their units 
of length from some part of the human body. Thus, we find the 
fathom (the distance of the outstretched hands), the cubit (the length 
ot the forearm), and later the ell (the distance from the elbow to the 
end of the finger), the foot (the length of the human foot), the span 
(the distance between the ends of the thumb and little finger when 
outstretched), the palm (the width of the hand), the digit (the breadth 
of the finger). The Roman foot was subdivided into four palms, 
and the palm into four digits. The division into inches or unci@ (a 
twelfth part) applied not only to the foot but to anything. 
108. For longer measures there was still less uniformity. We 
find the Hebrew’s half-day’s journey ; the Chinese lih, the distance a 
man’s voice can be heard upon a clear plain; the Greek stadium, prob-

ably derived from the length of the race course; the Roman pace of 
five feet; the furlong, the length of a furrow. The mille passus, a 
thousand paces, is the origin of the modern mile. 
109. In 1374 the inch is defined in English law as the length of 
“three barley corns, round and dry.” Later, other arbitrary measures 
of length were adopted by the government. The international meter 
is now the fundamental standard of length in the United States. The 
yard is defined as 3899 of a meter (see § 129). The foot and inch are 
subdivisions of this standard yard.

The furlong, equal to 40 rods, is seldom used. 
The fathom, equal to 6 feet, and the knot or geographical mile, 
equal to one minute of the equatorial circumference of the earth 
(6080 feet), are sometimes used.

varying with the length of the stick. 
1 cubic yard =1 load 
24% cubic feet = 1 perch 
114. Measures of Money. Originally, among primitive people, 
buying and selling was carried on by barter, or the actual exchange 
of commodities. The inconveniences arising from transactions of 
this kind brought about the adoption of a medium of exchange, or 
money. Money, usually consisting of gold and silver, was used at a 
very early period in the world’s history. Gold and silver seem at first 
to have been exchanged for commodities by weight. Business trans- 
actions were then still further simplified by the introduction of coins 
and paper money. Finally, as in the case of weights and measures, 
governments adopted definite standards of money value.

It is a cylindrical vessel 18} in. in diameter and 8 in. deep, containing 
2150.42 cu. in. 
Before the adoption of this and other standards by the English 
government there was even a greater variety of measures of capacity 
than of length and weight. 
122. Reduction of Compound Numbers. Quantities like 
5 mi. 10 rd. 7 yd. 2 ft. and 3 lb. 5 oz. are called com-

123. Addition and Subtraction of Compound Numbers. 
Compound addition and subtraction is the addition and 
subtraction of compound numbers of the same kind. The 
processes differ very little from the corresponding pro- 
cesses in the addition and subtraction of abstract numbers.

7x 2 ft.=14 ft.=4 yd. 2 ft. 5 yd. 2 ft. 
7x 5 yd. = 35 yd. 7 
35 yd. +4 yd. 2 ft.=39 yd. 2 ft. 39 yd. 2 ft. 
125. Division of Compound Numbers. Compound divi- 
sion is of two kinds. The first is the converse of multi- 
plication. In this case the quotient is a compound 
number of the same kind as the dividend. In the second 
case the dividend and divisor are both compound numbers 
of the same kind, and the quotient is an abstract number. 
126. The two cases arise from the fact that division may 
be regarded as the operation of finding one of two factors 
when the other factor and the product are given. 
Thus, 39 yd. 2 ft. is the product of 7 and 5 yd. 2 ft.

METRIC SYSTEM OF WEIGHTS AND MEASURES 
128. Late in the eighteenth century France invented the metric 
system of weights and measures, but it was not made obligatory until 
1837. Previous to this time there existed in France the same lack of 
uniformity in forming multiples and submultiples of the units of 
measure as exists in our system at the present time. The: metric 
system is now in use in most civilized countries except the United 
States and England. It was legalized by Congress in the United 
States in 1866, but has not been generally adopted. In scientific 
work the system is quite generally used in all countries.

ao measure or weight is derived; hence the 
name metric system. ‘The meter is theo- 
retically one ten-millionth part of the 
distance of the pole from the equator. 
Though an error has since been dis- 
covered in the measurement of the dis- 
tance, the meter has not been changed, 
and a rod of platinum 39.37 inches in 
length, deposited in the archives at 
Paris, is called the standard meter. 
130. The unit of capacity is called 
the liter. It is a cube whose edge is 
0.1 of a meter. 
181. The unit of weight is the gram. 
The gram.is the weight of a cube of 
distilled water at maximum density, 
whose edge is 0.01 of a meter. 
132. The above units of measure, 
together with the following prefixes, 
should be carefully memorized, because 
from them the whole metric system can 
be built up. 
133. The Latin prefixes, deci, centi, 
milli, denote respectively 0.1, 0.01, 0.001 
of the unit. The Greek prefix micro is 
used to denote 0.000001 of a unit. Thus, decimeter 
means 0.1 of a meter, and centigram means 0.01 of a 
gram.

kilometer means 1000 meters,’and hectoliter means 100 
liters. 
135. In general, nothing beyond practice in arithmetical 
operations would be gained in reducing from the metric

141. Measures of Angles and Time. The sexagesimal division of 
numbers is undoubtedly of Babylonian origin. The Babylonian 
priests in their astronomical work reckoned the year as 360 days. 
They supposed the sun to revolve around the earth once each year 
and hence divided the circumference of the circle into 360 parts, each 
of which represented the apparent daily path of the sun. They
-P-A-G-E-77
  MEASURES OF ANGLES AND TIME 17 
probably knew the construction of the regular hexagon by applying 
the radius to the circumference six times. It was then natural to 
take one of the 60 parts thus cut off as a unit and to further subdivide 
this unit into 60 equal parts, and so on, according to their method of 
sexagesimal fractions. This is the origin of our degree, minute and 
second. The names minutes and seconds are taken from the Latin 
partes minute prime and partes minute secunde. 
142. The principal measures of time are the day and the year. The 
day is the average time in which the earth revolves on its axis. The 
division of the day into 24 hours, of the hour into 60 minutes, and 
of the minute into 60 seconds is probably due to the Babylonians. 
The solar year is the time in which the earth travels once around the 
sun. It contains 365.2426 days. 
143. In zc. 46 Julius Cesar reformed the calendar and decreed 
that there should be three successive years of 365 days followed by a 
year of 866 days to account for the difference of 0.2426 of a day 
between the year of 365 days and the solar year. The difference be- 
tween four years of 365 days and four years of 365.2426 days is only 
0.9704 of a day, so that if a whole day is added every fourth year there is 
added 0.0296 of a day too much. In 1582 Pope Gregory XIII corrected 
this by striking 10 days from the year, — calling Oct. 5th Oct. 15th, — 
and he decreed that three leap years were to be omitted in every four 
hundred years. Every year whose number is divisible by four is a leap 
year unless it is a year ending a century, as 1900, when it is a leap 
year only if divisible by 400. 1800, 1900, 2100, are not leap years, but 
1600, 2000, 2400, are. The Gregorian calendar was adopted at once 
in Roman Catholic countries and in England in 1752. At the same 
time in England the beginning of the year was changed from 
March 25 to Jan. 1. Russia and some other countries still use the 
Julian calendar. Since 1582 they have had three more leap years 
(1700, 1800 and 1900) than countries using the Gregorian calendar, 
and hence are now 13 days behind other countries. What we call 
Jan. 23 is Jan. 10 with them. 
144. Dates given according to the Julian calendar are called Old 
Style (O.S.) and dates according to the Gregorian calendar are called 
New Style (N.S.)

  LONGITUDE AND TIME 
145. Longitude is distance east or west of the prime 
meridian. The meridian of the Royal Observatory at 
Greenwich, England, is the prime meridian generally 
adopted, and longitude is reckoned east or west 180° from 
that meridian. 
Since the earth makes one complete revolution on its 
axis in 24 hours, each place in its surface passes through 
360° in that time. Hence: 
360° of longitude correspond to 24 hr. of time. 
1° of longitude corresponds to 345 of 24 hr., or Js hr., or 4 min. 
1 of longitude corresponds to gy of 4 min., or 4 sec. 
1” of longitude corresponds to gy of 4 sec., or p; sec. 
And 
24 hr. of time correspond to 360° of longitude. 
1 hr. of time corresponds to 4 of 360°, or 15°. 
1 min. of time corresponds to gy of 15°, or 15’. 
1 sec. of time corresponds to gy of 15’, or 15”. 
Ex.1. The difference in time between two places is 
2 hr. 25 min. 13 sec. What is the difference in longitude? 
Solution. 2x 15° = 30°, 
25 x 15! = 375' = 6° 15/, 
18 x 15” = 195” = 3' 15", 
80° + 6°15’ + 3/15” = 36° 18" 15”.

146. International Date Line. Suppose that two men, starting from 
the prime meridian on Monday noon, travel the one eastward and the 
other westward, each traveling just as fast as the earth rotates. The

  80 LONGITUDE AND TIME 
man who goes west as fast as the earth turns east keeps exactly 
beneath the sun all the time; and it seems to him to be still Monday 
noon when he reaches his starting point again twenty-four hours 
later. He has lost a day in his reckoning by traveling westward 
around the earth. ae 
The other man travels eastward over the earth as fast as the earth 
itself turns eastward, and therefore he moves away from the sun 
twice as fast as the prime meridian does. After twelve hours’ travel 
he reaches the meridian of 180°, but twelve hours rotation has carried 
this meridian beneath the sun, and so the traveler reaches it at noon. 
In twenty-four hours the man reaches his starting point on the prime 
  
  
  
                             
  GO Long 90 EastiZ0 
meridian, but twenty-four hours’ rotation has brought this meridian 
beneath the sun again, so the traveler reaches it on the second noon 
after his start; he therefore supposes it to be Wednesday noon, though 
really it is but twenty-four hours after Monday noon. He has gained 
a day in his reckoning by traveling eastward around the earth. To 
correct such errors in their dates, navigators usually add a day to their 
reckoning when they sail westward across the meridian of 180°, and 
subtract a day when they cross it to the eastward. The line where the 
adjustment is made, corresponding in general with the meridian of 
180°, is called the international date line. 
The map represents the earth when it is noon Feb. 1 at Greenwich.

it is, therefore, one hour earlier in the day for each 15° west of 
Greenwich and one hour later in the day for each 15° east of Green- 
wich. Hence 180° west of Greenwich it is midnight of Jan. 31, and 
180° east of Greenwich it is midnight of Feb, 1. 
When it is 6 a.m. Feb. 1 at Greenwich, at 90° W. it is midnight of 
Jan. 31, and at 90° E, it is noon of Feb.-1; at 180° W. it is 6 p.m. 
Jan. 31 and at 180° E. it is 6 p.m. Feb. 1. In this case it is Jan. 31 
in all longitudes from 90° W. westward to the date line, and Feb. 1 
in all longitudes from 90° W. eastward to the date line. 
When it is midnight of Jan. 31 at Greenwich, at 90° W. it is 6 p.m. 
Jan. 31 and at 90 E. it is 6 a.m. Feb. 1; at 180° W. it is noon Jan. 31 
and at 180° E. it is noon Feb. 1. In this case it is Jan. 31 in all 
longitudes from Greenwich westward to the date line, and Feb. 1 in 
all longitudes from Greenwich eastward to the date line. 
When it is 6 p.m. Jan 31 at Greenwich, at 90° W. it is noon Jan. 31, 
and at 90° E. it is midnight Jan. 31; at 180° W. it is 6 a.m. Jan. 31, 
and at 180° E. it is 6 a.m. Feb.1. In this case it is Jan. 31 in all 
longitudes from 90° E. westward to the date line, and Feb. 1 in all 
longitudes from 90° E. eastward to the date line.

STANDARD TIME 
| BELTS 1 1 
  148. Standard Time. In order to secure uniform time 
over considerable territory, in 1883 the railroad com- 
panies of the United States decided to adopt standard 
time. They divided the country into four time belts, each 
of approximately 15° of longitude in width. The time in 
the various belts will therefore differ by hours, while the
-P-A-G-E-84
  84 LONGITUDE AND TIME 
minute and second hand of all timepieces will remain 
the same. The correct time is distributed by telegraph 
throughout the United States from the Naval Observa- 
tory at Washington each day. 
149. The Eastern time belt lies approximately 74° each 
side of the 75th meridian, and has throughout the local 
time of the 75th meridian. Similarly, the Central, Moun- 
tain and Pacific time belts lie approximately 74° each side 
of the 90th, 105th and 120th meridians, and the time 
throughout in each belt is determined by the local time 
of the 90th, 105th and 120th meridians. 
150. These divisions are not by any means equal or uni- 
form, since the different railroads change their time at 
the most convenient places. Consequently, variations are 
made from the straight line to include such places. Thus, 
while most roads change from Eastern to Central time at 
Buffalo, the Canadian roads extend the Eastern belt much 
farther west. 
151. Standard time has more recently been adopted by 
most of the leading governments of the world. With 
few exceptions the standard meridian chosen represents a 
whole number of hours from the prime meridian through 
Greenwich. 
Great Britain, Belgium and Holland use the time of the meridian 
through Greenwich. France uses the time of the meridian (2° 20’ E.) 
through Paris. Cape Colony uses the time of the meridian 22° 30’ E. 
Germany, Italy, Austria, Denmark, Norway and Sweden use the time 
of the 15th meridian east. Roumania, Bulgaria and Natal use the 
time of the 30th meridian east. Western Australia uses the time of 
the 120th meridian east. Southern Australia and.Japan use the time 
of the 185th meridian east. New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, and 
Tasmania use the time of the 150th meridian east. New Zealand uses 
the time of 170° 30! E.

  THE EQUATION 
152. An equation is a statement of equality of two num. 
bers or expressions. Thus, 5=3+42 and 3x5=165 are 
equations. 
153. The equation is one of the most powerful in- 
struments used in mathematics and can be used to 
decided advantage in the solution of many arithmetical 
problems. 
~ 154. The book written by the Egyptian priest Ahmes, and re- 
ferred to elsewhere, is one of the very oldest records of the extent of 
mathematical knowledge among the ancients. In this book we find 
a very close relation between arithmetic and algebra. A number of 
problems are given leading to the simple equation. Here the unknown 
quantity is called hau or “heap,” and the equation is given in the fol- 
lowing form: heap its 3, its 4, its }, its whole, gives 33, or 42+ 4a 
+}2+4+2=33. (Cajori, “History of Elementary Mathematics,” 
p- 28.) 
Fz. 1. Find a number such that, if 80 is subtracted, 
2 of the original number will remain. 
The given relation may be expressed as follows: 
The number diminished by 30 equals of the number. 
From this relation we are to find the number. 
Let « = the number. 
Then x — 30 =the number diminished by 30, and 2?” =#% of the 
number. 
.. x — 80 = 2x is the equation expressing the relation between the 
number given in the conditions of the problem and the letter repre- 
senting the number to be found.

-P-A-G-E-87
THE EQUATION 87 
Solution. Since we wish to obtain an equation with z alone on the 
left side and only numerical quantities on the right side, we proceed 
as follows: 
Subtracting 3a from both sides of the equation, we have 
a—30-24=32-32, Axiom 3. 
or 4r2-—30=0. 
Adding 30 to both sides of the equatior, we have 
42 —30+4 30 = 30, Axiom 2. 
or 42=30. 
Multiplying both terms by 3, we have 
90. 
«. 90 is the required number. 
To check the result, substitute 90 for the unknown number in the 
problem. 
This gives us 
90 — 30 = 3 of 90, 
or 60 = 60. 
. x = 90 is the correct result. 
Ex. 2. The sum of two numbers is 20 and their differ- 
ence is 4. What are the numbers? 
Solution. Let x = the larger number. 
Then x — 4 = the smaller number. 
“ 2 +2—4= 20. 
22 = 24, Axiom 2. 
or x = 12 = the larger number. Axiom 5.

  POWERS AND ROOTS 
155. Archimedes (287-212 3.c.) in his measurements of the circle 
computed the approximate value of a number of square roots, but 
nothing is known of his method. * A little later, Heron of Alexandria 
also used the approximation Va? + =a + noe eg. V85 = V9? +4 
= 9+ oy i “2a ( 
156. The Hindus included powers and roots among the funda- 
mental processes of arithmetic. As early as 476 a.p. they used the 
formule (a + 6)? = a? + 2 ab + b? and (a+b)? =a? +3 a* +3 ab? +b 
in the extraction of square and cube root, and they separated numbers 
into periods of two and three figures each. 
157. The Arabs also extracted roots by the formula for (a + 0)". 
They introduced a radical sign by placing the initial letter of the 
word jird (root) over the number. 
158. The power of a number is the product that arises 
by multiplying the number by itself any number of times. 
The second power is called the square of the number and 
the number itself is called the square root of its second 
power. Thevthird power is called the cube of the number, 
and the number itself is called the cube root of its third 
power. Thus, 4 is the square of 2, and 2 is the square root 
of 4. 125 is the cube of 5, and 5 is the cube root of 125. 
159. Since the square root of a number is one of the two 
equal factors of a perfect second power, numbers that are 
not exact squares have no square roots. However, they 
are treated as having approximate square roots. These 
approximate square roots can be found to any required

degree of accuracy. Thus, the square root of 91 correct 
to 0.1 is 9.5, and correct to 0.01 is 9.54. 
160. According to the definition, only abstract numbers 
have square roots. 
161. The square, the cube, fourth power, etc., of 2 are 
expressed by 2, 28, 24, ete.. The small figure which de- 
notes the power is called the exponent. 
162. The square root is denoted by the symbol v/, the 
cube root by ¥/, the fourth root by ~, ete. 
163. The following results are important : 
13=1, 
| 102 = 100, 
| 1002 = 10000, 
1000? = 1000000. 
The squares of all numbers between 1 and 10 lie be- 
tween 1 and 100, the squares of all numbers between 10 
and 100 lie between 100 and 10000, ets. Hence, the square 
of a number of one digit is a number of one or two digits, 
the square of a number of two digits is a number of three 
or four digits, ete. It will be noticed that the addition of 
a digit to a number adds two digits to the square.

part. After subtracting 40? the remainder is 2 x 40 x 3+ 3% The 
trial divisor, 2 x 40, is contained in the remainder 3 times. By adding 
8 to 2 x 40 the complete divisor, 2 x 40 + 3,isformed. The complete 
divisor is contained exactly 3 times in the remainder. By this division 
the 3, the second figure of the root, is found.

Separating 1849 into periods of two figures each (why?) we find 
that 1600 is the greatest square in 1800. 4 is therefore the first figure 
in the root. Subtracting 1600 and using 2 x 40 as the trial divisor, 
the next figure in the root is found to be 3. Completing the divisor 
by adding the 3, it is found to be exactly contained in the remainder.

174. In the preceding we notice that 30 is the cube root of the first 
part. 
After subtracting 30% the remainder is 8 x 30?x 7 +3 x 30x 724738 
The trial divisor, 3 x 30, is contained in the remainder 7 times. 
By adding 3 x 30x 7+ 7? the complete divisor is formed. This 
complete divisor is contained 7 times in the remainder. By this 
division the 7, the second figure in the root, is found.

8 x 80743 x 30 x7 + 72 = 3379

Separating 50653 into periods of three figures each (Why?) we 
find that 27000 is the greatest cube in 50000. The first figure o! the 
root is therefore 3. Subtracting 27000 and using 3 x 30? as the trial 
divisor, the next figure in the root (since 8, when the trial divisor is 
completed, proves to be too large) is found to be 7. Completing the 
divisor by adding 3 x 30 x 7 +72, it is found to be contained exactly 
7 times in the remainder. If the number contains more than two 
periods, the process is to be repeated.

176. Certain measurements have been in very common use in the 
development of arithmetical knowledge from the earliest times. 
177. The Babylonians and Egyptians used a great variety of 
geometrical figures in decorating their walls and in tile floors. The 
sense perception of these geometrical figures led to their actual 
measurement and finally to abstract geometrical reasoning. 
178. The Greeks credited the Egyptians with the invention of 
geometry and gave as its origin the measurement of plots of land. 
Herodotus says that the Egyptian king, Sesostris (about 1400 B.c.), 
divided Egypt into equal rectangular plots of ground, and that the 
annual overflow of the Nile either washed away portions of the plot 
or obliterated the boundaries, making new measurements necessary. 
These measurements gave rise to the study of geometry (from ge, 
earth, and metron, to measure). 
179. Ahmes, in his arithmetical work, calculates the contents of 
barns and the area of squares, rectangles, isosceles triangles, isosceles 
trapezoids and circles. There is no clew to his method of calculating 
volumes. In finding the area of the isosceles triangle he multiplies a 
side by half of the base, giving the area of a triangle whose sides are 
10 and base 4 as 20 instead of 19.6, the result obtained by multiply- 
ing the altitude by half of the base. For the area of the isosceles 
trapezoid he multiplies a side by half the sum of the parallel bases, 
instead of finding the altitude and multiplying that by half the sum 
of the two. parallel sides. He finds the area of the circle by subtract- 
ing from the diameter } of its length and squaring the remainder. 
This leads to the fairly correct value of 3.1604 for 7. 
180. The Egyptians are also credited with knowing that in special 
cases the square on the hypotenuse of a right triangle is equal to the 
sum of the squares of the other two sides. They were careful to 
locate their temples and other public buildings on north and south,

and east and west lines. The north and south line they determined 
by means of the stars. The east and west line was determined at 
right angles to the other, probably by stretching around three pegs, 
driven into the ground, a rope measured into three parts which bore 
the same relation to each other as the numbers 3, 4 and 5. Since 
3? + 4? = 5%, this gave the three sides of a right triangle. 
181. The ancient Babylonians knew something of rudimentary 
geometrical measurements, especially of the circle. ‘They also ob- 
tained a fairly correct value of 7. 
182. It was the Greeks who made geometry a science and gave 8 ap gi 
rigid demonstrations of geometrical theorems. 
183. The importance of certain measurements gives 
mensuration a prominent place in arithmetic to-day. The 
rules and formule of the present chapter will be developed 
without the aid of formal demonstration. 
184. The Rectangle. If the   
  
  
              unit of measure CVXW isl sq. 4 # 
in., then the strip CYMD con- 
tains 5x1 sq. in. =5 sq. in., x 
and the whole area contained in ™/ uy 
the three strips will be 3x5 aT 
sq. in., or 15 sq. in. 
185. The dimensions of a rectangle are its base and alti- 
tude, and the area is equal to the product of the base and 
altitude. That is, the number of square units in the area is 
equal to the product of the numbers that represent the base 
and altitude. If we denote the area by A, the number of 
units in the base by 0, and the numbers of units in the alti- 
tude by a, then A=abd and any one of the three quantities, 
A, 6, a, can be determined when the other two are given. 
Thus, if the area of a rectangle is 54 sq. in. and the altitude is 6 in,, 
the base can be determined from 6 6 = 54, or b = 9 in,
-P-A-G-E-101
  MENSURATION 101 
186. If the dimensions of a rectangle are equal, the 
figure is a square and the area is equal to the second 
power of a number denoting the length of its side, or 
A=a*. For this reason the second power of a number is 
called its square. 
187. The Parallelogram.. Any parallelogram has the 
same area as a rectangle with the same base and altitude, 
as can be shown by dividing the parallelogram ABCD 
into two parts, M and J, and i.   
  
  placing them as in A’B’C'D', ; es 
thus forming a rectangle with the ae 
same base and altitude as the D a Cc 
given parallelogram. Therefore, a at 
the area of a parallelogram ts equal 
to the product of its base,and alti- [x /x4 
tude, or A= ab. D a o’ 
188. The Triangle. Since the line AB divides the 
parallelogram into two equal triangles with the same base 
and altitude as the parallelogram, the 
area of the triangle is equal to one 
half of the area of the parallelogram. 
But the area of the parallelogram is 
equal to the product of its base and 
altitude. Therefore, the area of the triangle is one half 
the product of its base and altitude, or A=} ab. 
m Thus, the area of a triangle with base 6 in. and altitude 5 in. is $ 
of 6'x 5 sq. in. = 15 sq. in. 
189. The Trapezoid. The e Bi 
line AB divides the trapezoid 
into two triangles whose bases 
are the upper and lower 
bases of the trapezoid and whose common altitude is the De B

  102 MENSURATION 
altitude of the trapezoid. The areas of the triangles are 
respectively $.ab, and }6,, and since the area of the 
trapezoid equals the sum of the areas of the triangles, 
therefore the area of the trapezoid is }ab,+}$ab,= 
_$4(6,+ 4), or the area of a trapezoid is equal to one half 
of the product of its altitude and the sum of the upper and 
lower bases, or A=} a(b,+ by). 
Thus, the area of a trapezoid whose bases are 20 ft. and 17 ft. and 
whose altitude is 6 ft. is } of 6 x (20 + 17) sq. ft. = 111 sq. ft. 
190. The Right Triangle. The Hindu mathematician 
Bhaskara (born 1114 A.p.) arranged the figure so that the 
square on the hypotenuse contained four right triangles, 
leaving in the middle a small square whose side equals 
  
  the difference between the sides of the right triangle. In 
a second figure the small square and the right triangles 
were arranged in a different way so as to make up the 
squares on the two sides. Bhaskara’s proof consisted 
simply in drawing the figure and writing the one word 
“Behold.” From these figures it is evident that the area 
of the square constructed on the hypotenuse will equal the 
sum of the areas of the squares constructed on the two sides. 
Tn general, if the sides of the right triangle are a and 6 
and the hypotenuse is ¢, a?+ 6? = ¢.

ured, and if the quotient a is taken in each case, the 
quotients will be found to have nearly the same value. 
If absolutely correct measurements could be made, the 
quotient in each case would be the same and equal to 
8.14159+, z.e. the ratio of the circumference of a circle 
to its diameter is the same for all circles. The ratio is 
denoted by the Greek letter 7 (pi). The value of 7 
found in geometry is 3.14159+. In common practice 7 
is taken as 3.1416. The value of cannot be exactly 
expressed by any number, but can be found correct to 
any desired number of decimal places.

that represent its dimensions. 
196. If the dimensions of the rectangular parallelopiped 
are a, b and ¢, it can be shown in the same way that 
V=abe. Any of these four quantities, V, a, b, c, can be

Ex. Tf the volume of a rectangular parallelopiped is 36 cu. in. and 
two of the dimensions are 6 in. and 2 in., the third dimension is 
36 =3,. .. 3 in. is the other dimension.

197. If the dimensions of a rectangular parallelopiped 
are equal, the figure is a cube and the volume is equal to 
the third power of the number denoting the length of its 
edge (a), or V= a’. For this reason the third power of a 
number is called its cube. 
198. It is proved in geometry that any parallelopiped 
has the same volume as a rectangular parallelopiped with 
the same base and altitude.

dimensions is the same as the statement that its volume is 
equal to the product of its altitude and the area of its base. 
199. The Volume of a Prism. A rectangular 
parallelopiped can be divided into two equal 
triangular prisms with the same altitude and 
half the base. Hence, the volume of the 
prism is half the volume of the parallelopiped. 
But the base of the parallelopiped is twice 
the base of the prism, therefore, the volume of 
a triangular prism is equal to the product of 
its altitude and the area of its base.     
       
          
    200. Since any prism can be divided into 
triangular prisms, as in the figure, it follows 
that the volume of any prism is equal to the 
product of its altitude and the area of its 
base. 
201. The Volume of a Cylinder. The 
cylinder may be divided into a number of 
solids that are essentially prisms, as indi-

of these prisms is the base of the cylinder 
and the altitude of the prisms is the same 
as the altitude of the cylinder. There- 
fore, the volume of a cylinder is the product 
of its altitude and the area of its base.

202. The Volume of a Pyramid. Let AB be a cube and 
F the middle point of the cube, then by connecting # with 
B, C, D and Fa pyramid with a square 
base is formed. It is evident that by 
drawing lines from F' to each of the ver- 
tices, the cube will consist of six such 
pyramids. Hence, the volume of the 
pyramid is 4 of the volume of the cube. 
The volume of the cube is the product of 
its altitude and the area of its base BCDE. Therefore, 
the volume of the pyramid is } of the product of the alti- 
tude of the cube and the area of its base. But the base 
   
-P-A-G-E-109
    MENSURATION 109 
of the pyramid is the base of the cube and its altitude 
is $ of the altitude of the cube, hence, the volume of the 
pyramid is one third of the product of its altitude and the 
area of its base. In geometry this is proved true of any 
pyramid. 
Ex. Tf the altitude of a pyramid is 45™, and a side of its square 
base is 60™, its volume is 4 of 45 x (602)™° = 54000™%, 
203. The Volume of a Cone. The cone 
may be divided into a number of equal fig- 
ures that are essentially pyramids as indi- 
eated in the figure. The sum of the bases 
of these pyramids is the base of the cone, 
and their altitudes are the same as the alti- 
tude of the cone. Therefore, the volume of 
a cone is equal to one third of the product of 
its altitude and the area of its base. 
Ex. If the altitude of a cone is 10 ft. and ‘the radius of its base 
4 ft., its volume is } of 10 x 3.1416 x 4? cu. ft, = 167.55 cu. ft.

204. The Surface of a Sphere. The surface of a sphere 
is proved in geometry to be equal to the 
area of 4 great circles or 477’, r being the 
radius of the sphere. This can be shown 
by winding a firm cord to cover. a hemi- 
sphere and a great circle as indicated in the 
figure. It will be found that twice as much 
cord is used to cover the hemisphere as the 
great circle, therefore, to cover the whole 
sphere 4 times as much would be required. 
  Ex. A sphere with a radius of 6 in. has a surface of 4 x 3.1416 x 
6? sq. in. = 452.39+ sq. in. 
205. The Volume of a Sphere. The sphere may be 
divided into a number of fig- 
ures that are essentially pyra- 
mids, as indicated in the figure. 
The sum of the bases of these 
pyramids is the surface of the 
sphere and the altitude of each 
pyramid is its radius. Therefore, the volume of all these 
pyramids is equal to $r x 4ar? = 477°. 
  Ex. The volume of a sphere whose radius is 3 in. is 4 x 3.1416 
x 88 cu. in. = 1138.1 cu. in.

foot is used. It is a board 1 ft. long, 1 ft. wide and 1 in. 
or less thick. Lumber more than 1 in. thick is measured 
by the number of square feet of boards 1 in. thick to 
which it is equal. 
Thus, a board 10 ft. long, 1 ft. wide and 1} in. thick, 
contains 15 board feet.

* 208. Carpeting. A yard of carpet refers to the running 
measurement, regardless of the width. The cheaper grades 
of carpet are usually 1 yd. wide, and the more expensive, 
such as Brussels, Wilton, etc., are $ of a yard wide. 
In carpeting, it is usually necessary to allow for some 
waste in matching the figures in patterns. Dealers count 
this waste in their charges. In computing the cost of 
carpets, dealers charge the same for a fractional width as 
for a whole one. 
Carpets may often be laid with less waste one way of 
the room than the other; hence, it is sometimes best to 
compute the cost with the strips running both ways, and 
by comparison determine which involves the smaller waste.   EXERCISE 387

such natural objects as near-by bowlders, ponds, established 
roads, etc. But all states whose lands have been surveyed 
since 1802 are divided by a system of meridians and paral- 
lels into townships 6 miles square. Each township con- 
tains 36 square miles or sections. Each section contains 
2 half sections or 4 quarter sections. 
Public lands are located with reference to a north and 
south line called the principal meridian and an east and 
west line called the base line. The north and south rows 
of townships are called ranges 
and these rows are numbered 
from the principal meridian. 
The townships are numbered 
from the base line. A township

  GRAPHICAL REPRESENTATIONS 
217. Graphical methods of representing relations be- 
tween different measurements are so extensively used in 
many lines of work that it seems best to give a brief treat- 
ment of the subject here. Such graphical representations 
as are given in the following exercises show relations pic- 
torially in a much clearer manner than can be shown by a 
mere statement of figures. 
Ex.1. Explain graphically the relation between an inch 
and a centimeter. The two lines drawn 
accurately to scale represent graphically a nes 
the relation between the inch and the 
centimeter. 1 cm.

RATIO AND PROPORTION 
218. The ratio of one number to another of the same 
kind is their quotient. The former number is called the 
antecedent, and the latter the consequent. ‘The terms of 
the ratio therefore bear the same relation to each other as 
the terms of a fraction. Thus, the ratio of a to 6 may be 
written a: 6 (read the ratio of a to 6), ; ora+b. The 
forms a: 6, and : are generally used. The ratio of 3 ft. 
io 5 ft. is 3:5. This may also be expressed by 3 or 0.6. 
219. The ratio is always an abstract number, since it is 
the relation of one number to another of the same kind. 
There can be no ratio between 5 hr. and $10, nor between 
7 lb. and 6 ft. But there can be a ratio between 3 ft. and 
6 in., since the quantities are of the same kind. Both 
terms must, however, be reduced to the same unit. Thus, 
3 ft. = 36 in., and 36 in.: 6 in. = 36=6,. 
The ratio A is called the inverse or reciprocal of the 
BC) ratlo ++

the ratio of the volumes of two spheres is equal to what ? 
220. Specific Gravity. The specific gravity of a sub- 
stance is the ratio of its weight to the weight of an equal 
volume of some other substance taken as a standard. 
221. Distilled water at its maximum density, 4° C., is 
the standard of specific gravity for solids and liquids., 
222. Since 1°™ of water weighs 1 gram, the same num- 
ber that expresses the weight of any substance in grams 
will also express its specific gravity. Thus, 1™ of water 
weighs 1%; hence, 1 is the specific gravity of water. 1™ 
of lead weighs 11.358; hence, this being 11.35 times as 
heavy as an equal volume of water, the specific gravity of 
lead is 11.35.

  RATIO AND PROPORTION 135 
223. Proportion. A proportion is an equality of ratios 
and is expressed in the following way: 
ee bod’ 
a:b=e:d, 
@: Ditaias 
224. The method of solving problems by proportion is 
-often called the Rule of Three, since problems which give 
three quantities so related that two of them sustain the 
same ratio to each other as the third to the quantity 
required, can readily be solved by proportion. 
225. Thus, if any three of the four terms of a proportion 
are known, the other one can be found. 
If 22, then, o= 8 x $= 2}. 
Check by putting 21 for x, then == 
226. The first and last terms of a proportion are called 
the extremes, and the second and third terms the means. 
227. In any proportion the product of the means is equal 
to the product of the extremes. 
If ;7y then by clearing of fractions ad=be. This 
proves the proposition, since a and d are the extremes, and 
6 and ¢ the means.

2 men working at the same rate will do the work in 3 
days, 3 men will do it in 2 days, etc. 2 men Hg the work 
in } the time that 1 man will do it; 8 men in 4 the time, 
etc. Hence, as the number of men Saitereel the time 
diminishes in the same ratio. If 2 men do the work in 3 
days, 8 men will do it in 3 of 8 days, or 2 days. There- 
fore the ratio of the number of men, 3, is equal to the 
corresponding ratio of time inverted. Hence, the number 
of men is said to be inversely proportional to the time.

230. In solving any arithmetical problem the student 
will find the following suggestions useful : 
(1) The first essential is a thorough understanding of 
the proper relations between the conditions given. This 
requires some form of analysis leading to a complete state- 
ment of the conditions. 
(2) The solution should involve no unnecessary work. 
Cancellation and other convenient short methods should 
be used if possible. 
(8) All arithmetical work should be carefully checked. 
The student must realize that accuracy is of the highest 
importance and that to secure accuracy his work must 
always be checked. Any arithmetical work that has an 
error in it is valueless. The check also gives the student 
a means of knowing for himself whether he has a correct 
result or not. He has no need of answers to his problems. 
Ex. 1. If the time of the beat of a pendulum varies 
as the square root of its length, and the length of a pendu- 
lum that beats seconds is 39.2 in., find the length of a 
pendulum that beats 50 times a minute. 
Solution. The given pendulum beats 60 times per minute, the 
required pendulum beats 50 times per minute. 
Since the longer the pendulum the more slowly it beats, the re- 
quired pendulum is longer than the given one. 
Therefore, the square root of the lengths of the pendulums are 
in the ratio $9, or 4.

Ex. 2. The greatest possible sphere is cut from a cube, 
one of whose edges is 3 ft. Find the portion of the cube 
cut away. 
Solution. The volume of the cube is 33 cu. ft. 
The volume of the sphere is 4a x ($)? cu. ft. 
Therefore the portion cut away is 8° cu. ft. — 4 x ($)8 cu. ft.

unit is defined as the amount of work required to over- 
come the resistance of one pound through a space of one 
foot. The rate of work is generally defined by using the 
term horse power. An engine of one horse power can do 
33000 foot pounds of work in one minute, ¢.e. can over- 
come a resistance of 33000 pounds through a space of one 
foot in one minute. 
Ex. 5. What horse power is an engine exerting that 
draws a train with a uniform speed of 40 miles an hour 
against a resistance of 1000 pounds? 
Solution. The amount of work done in one hour is 1000 x 40

of multiplication and division are used. Frequently stu- 1 
dents in solving such problems will perform the operations 
indicated at each step, thus doing a large amount of un- 
necessary work. By carefully studying these model solu- 
tions the student will see where the unnecessary work can 
be avoided. 
As indicated in Art. 41, it is a good plan, whenever pos- 
sible, to estimate the result mentally and to compare this 
rough estimate with the result found by solving the prob- 
lem. ‘This will prevent large errors and such errors as 
arise from misplacing the decimal point.

  \ PERCENTAGE 
~ 233. 4=,69, = 0.50 = 50% = 50 per cent, 
and t= =e 0.834 = 331% = 334 per cent. 
These are different ways of denoting the same fractional 
part. In business operations it is customary to express 
fractions in hundredths, but in stating problems the 
denominator 100 is omitted and the per cent symbol, %, 
or the expression per cent is used. Percentage is there- 
fore only an application of the decimal fraction and not 
a separate department of arithmetic. 
234. The word percentage is derived from the Latin 
per centum, meaning by the hundredths. 
235. The number denoting how many hundredths are 
taken is called the rate per cent. Thus, if 5% of a number 
is to be taken, 5 is called the rate per cent, and 5% the rate. 
236. The following examples illustrate several closely 
related operations frequently used in business transactions. 
Ex. 1. What is 8% of $750? 
Solution. 8% of $750 = 0.08 of $750 = $60.

  COMMERCIAL DISCOUNTS 
237. Manufacturers, publishers and wholesale dealers 
have a fixed price list for their products. Their customers 
are allowed certain discounts from their list price, deter- 
mined by the current market value. Thus, a book may 
be published at $1.50 with a discount of 20% to dealers. 
The $1.50 is the list price and 20% is the discount. The 
list price less the discount ($1.50—20% of $1.50=$1.20) 
is the net price, or cost. 
238. To avoid the inconvenience and expense of issuing a new 
catalogue whenever the market values change, business houses gen- 
erally print a new trade price list giving new discounts, without 
issuing a new catalogue. The discount is changed either by increas- 
ing or diminishing the single rate of discount already allowed, accord- 
ing as the cost of production is diminished or increased. If the 
discount is to be increased, the change is generally made by quoting 
a further discount. Thus, in a catalogue of electrical goods a 32 
candle power lamp is quoted at $1.20. In trade price list A, accom- 
panying the catalogue, a discount of 50% is allowed on small orders. 
In trade price list B, issued later on account of a change in the cost 
of production, a discount of 50% and 15% is allowed. A dealer buy- 
ing 10 lamps according to trade price list A would pay 10 x $1.20 
— 50% of 10 x $1.20 = $6, while according to trade price list B he 
would pay $6 — 15% of $6 = $5.10. 
The discount is frequently increased in case of large orders. Thus, 
in the above trade price iist, a discount of 50% is allowed on all orders 
for less than 25 lamps, a discount of 50% and 20% is allowed on all 
orders for 25 to 100 lamps, and a discount of 50%, 20% and 10% on 
» orders for 100 or over.

MARKING GOODS 
240. Most merchants use a private mark to indicate the 
cost and selling price of goods. They usually select some 
word or phrase containing 10 different letters and use it 
asa key. ‘These letters are used to represent the 9 digits 
and 0. In this way the cost and selling price will be 
understood only by those who know the key. 
Two different keys are generally selected, one to mark the cost and 
the other to mark the selling price. One or more extra letters, called 
repeaters, are used to avoid the repetition of a figure and to prevent 
giving any clew to the private mark used. The cost is usually written 
above and the selling price below a line. 
241. The words equinoctial (omitting the last 7) and 
importance are adapted for use as keys, since they both

  COMMISSION AND BROKERAGE 
242. Farmers, produce dealers, manufacturers and 
others frequently find it more convenient to employ a 
third person to dispose of their goods, instead of selling 
called a commission merchant, an agent or a broker. direct to consumers.. The person who sells the goods is 
pay received for such services is called commission or 
brokerage. 
243. Produce is usually shipped to a commission mer- 
chant, and sold by him in his own name. The proceeds 
less-the commission, or the net proceeds, are sent to the 
shipper or consignor. If a commission merchant is buying 
; goods for a customer, he charges the cost plus the com- 
mission. The amount of commission varies in different 
lines of business. 
244. A broker buys and sells without having possession 
of the goods, and generally does not make contracts in his 
own name. 
245. Commission, or brokerage, is usually computed at 
a certain per cent of the amount realized on sales, or in- 
vested for the customer. In buying and selling certain

INTEREST 
246. Interest is money paid for the use of money. 
247. The sum loaned is called the principal. 
248. The rate of interest is the rate per cent per annum 
of the principal paid for the use of money. 
In the absence of a specific contract the rate of interest is fixed by 
law in most states. The rate thus determined is called the legal rate. 
By special contract interest may be received at a higher rate than the 
legal rate. The maximum contract rate is fixed by law in most states. 
Interest in excess of the maximum contract rate is called usury. The 
penalty for usury is fixed by law in states where it is forbidden. 
249. The principal plus the interest is called the amount. 
250. The practical business problem of most frequent 
occurrence in interest is to find the interest when the prin- 
cipal, rate, and time are given. 
251. In computing interest without tables it is usually 
the custom to reckon the year as 360 da., the month as 
zy of a year and the day as 54; of a month or 45 of a year. 
(See, however, § 254.) 
Ex. Find the interest and amount of $720 for 2 yr. 
6 mo. 15 da. at 6%. 
Solution. 2 yr. 6 mo. 15 da. = $48 yr. 
The interest for one year = 0.06 of $720. 
«. the interest for $4 yr. = $43 x z8y x $720 = $109.80. 
The amount is $720 + $109.80 = $829.80.

252. A short method of computing interest at 6% is based 
on the year of 12 mo. of 30 da. each. This method is 
sometimes called the 6% method. 
The interest on $1 for 1 yr. at 6% , = $0.06. 
The interest on $1 for 1 mo. at 6% = ¥, of $0.06 = $0.005. 
The interest on $1 for 1 da. at 6% = sof $0.005 = $0.0004. 
_ Ex. Find the interest on $250 for 2 yr. 4 mo, 12 da. 
at 6%. 2 
The interest on $1 for 2 yr. at 6%=2 x $0.06 = $0.12. 
The interest on $1 for 4.mo. at 6% = 4 x $0.005—= $0.02. 
The interest on $1 for 12 da. at 64, = 13 x $0.0003 = $0.002. 
«. the interest on $1 for 2 yr. 4 mo. 12 da. at 6%, = $0.142. 
~. the interest on $250 for 2 yr.4 mo. 12 da.=250 x $0.142 =$35.50.

States government, by some banks, and to some extent in 
other business transactions.

involved, the principal, the rate, the time and the interest. 
When any three of these are given, the other cah be found. 
As indicated above, the practical business problem is to 
find the interest when the principal, rate and the time are 
given. However, the principles involved in the following 
illustrative examples are frequently met with in business : 
Ex. 1. What principal will produce $72 interest in 1 yr. 
6 mo. at 6%? 
Solution. Let x = the principal. 
Then $x 6% of c= $72.

interest period. (Then the amount becomes the new prin- 
cipal for the next interest period. 
Unless otherwise stated, interest is compounded annually, though 
it may be compounded semiannually, quarterly, etc., by agreement. 
In most states compound interest cannot be collected by law, but pay- 
ment of it does not constitute usury. 
Ex. Find the compound interest on $500 for 8 yr. 
4 mo. 15 da. at 4%. 
Solution. $500 = principal first year. 
  
  0.04 
20.00 = interest first year. 
500 
$520.00 = amount first year = principal second year. 
0.04 
20.80 = interest second year. 
520 
$540.80 = amount second year = principal third year. 
0.04 
21.63 = interest third year. 
540.80   
$562.43 = amount third year = principal fourth year. 
Interest on $562.43 for # mo. 15 da. at 4% = $8.44. 
$562.43 + $8.44 = $570.87 = amount for 3 yr. 4 mo. 15 da,

$70.87 = compound interest for 3 yr. 4 mo. 15 da. 
258. The chief use of compound interest is among large 
investors, such as life insurance companies, building and 
loan associations, private banking, establishments, etc., 
who wish to compute the income from reinvestment of 
interest when due. For such work compound interest 
tables are used.

259. Annual Interest. If a note or other written agree- 
ment contains the expression “with annual interest” or 
“with interest payable annually,” the interest is due at 
the end of each year, and if not then paid, will draw simple 
interest until paid. Such a note or agreement is said to 
bear annual interest. The same principle is applied when 
the interest is payable semiannually, quarterly, etc. 
As in the case of compound interest, in most states annual interest 
cannot be collected by law, but does not constitute usury. 
Ex. George Reed borrowed $1500 at 7%, and agreed 
to pay interest annually. Having paid no interest, he 
wishes to settle at the end of 3 yr. 3 mo. 20 da. What 
is the amount due? 
The simple interest on $1500 for 8 yr. 3 mo. 20 da. at 7% = $347.08. 
' Then, in addition to this, the simple interest on 
$105 at 7% for 2 yr. 3 mo. 20 da. 
$105 at 7% for 1 yr. 3 mo. 20 da. 
$105 at 7% for 3 mo. 20 da. 
or on $105 at 7% for 8 yr. 11 mo. = $28.79. 
Hence, principal borrowed = $1500 
Simple interest = 347.08 
Simple interest on interest not paid when due = 28.79 
«. total amount due at annual interest = $1875.87

5. Notes are sometimes given with interest coupons 
attached. These coupons draw interest, frequently at a 
higher rate than the note itself, if not paid when due. A 
coupon note for $2200 is issued July 1, 1896, at 6% inter- 
est. Nothing is paid until July 1,1902. Find the amount 
at that date, the coupons bearing 7% if not paid when due. 
260. Promissory Notes. A promissory note is a written 
promise to pay to a certain person named in the note a 
specified sum of money on demand, or at a specified time. 
261. A promissory note is negotiable, i.e. can be trans- 
ferred from one owner to another by indorsement when 
it is made payable to the order of a definite person, or to 
bearer.

  Andrew Johnson is the maker of this note, Henry 
James is the payee, and $1000 is the face. 
262. The above note would be non negotiable if the 
words “the order of” were omitted. In that case the 
note would be payable to Henry James only. 
263. If a note is sold by the payee, he must indorse it 
by writing his name across the back. 
264. There are three common forms of indorsement : 
(1) In blank, the indorser 
simply writing his name across 
the back, thus making the note envy James.

  265. By indorsing a note either in blank or in full, the 
payee becomes responsible for its payment if the maker 
fails to pay it. The indorsement in full will insure greater 
safety since in this case the note is made payable to a 
definite person. 
266. A note made payable to Henry James, or bearer, 
is also negotiable, but does not need indorsement. 
267. The custom of allowing three days of grace in the 
payment of a note has been abolished in many states and 
is rarely used in others. 
268. The note on page 179 will mature March 27 + 60 days, or 
May 26, if no grace is allowed. It will mature March 27 + 63 days, 
or May 29, if grace is allowed. In states where grace is allowed this 
is indicated by writing in the note, “Due May 26/29.” 
269. In most states a note falling due on Sunday or a legal holiday 
must be paid the preceding business day.

note, not being able to pay the whole amount at one time, 
makes several partial payments, which are indorsed on the 
back of the note with the date of payment.

271. The above example is solved by the United States 
Rule of Partial Payments, which is the legal method in 
most states. By this method the amount of the note is 
found to the time when the payment, or the sum of the 
payments, equals or exceeds the interest due. From this 
amount the payment, or sum of the payments, is sub- 
tracted. This operation is repeated to the time of the 
next payment and so on. 
272. It will be seen that three cases may arise under 
this rule: 
(1) The payment may be exactly equal to the interest due. In 
this case the payment simply cancels the interest, and the balance due 
remains the same as the original principal. 
(2) The payment may be greater than the interest due. In this 
case the balance due is diminished by the amount the payment 
exceeds the interest due. 
(3) The payment may be less than the interest due. In this case 
if the unpaid balance of the interest were added, the principal would 
be increased, and the debtor would be paying more interest than if he 
had made no payment at all. Therefore, when the payment is less 
than the interest due, no change is made at that time in the principal ; 
but the interest is reckoned to the date when the sum of the payments 
sloes exceed the interest due, and then the sum of these payments is 
subtracted. 
273. The following method of solving problems in 
partial payments, called The Merchants’ Rule, is used 
   
-P-A-G-E-184
184 INTEREST 
among many business men when the note runs for one 
year or less: 
Ex. Sept. 1, 1904, a merchant takes a note for $327.50 
from a customer in payment for some goods. The note is 
to run for 1 yr. at 6%. During the year the following 
payments are made: Noy. 1, 1904, $75; April 1, 1905, 
$100; Aug. 1, 1905, $50. Find the amount due Sept. 1, 
1905. 
The amount of $327.50 for 1 yr. at 6% 
The amount of $75 for 10 mo. at 6% 
The amount of $100 for 5 mo. at 6% 102.50 
The amount of $50 for 1 mo. at 6% 50.25 231.50 
Balance due Sept. 1, 1905 4 $115.65 
274. By this method the amount of the note is found from the 
date of the note to the time of settlement. The amount of each 
payment is also found from its date to the time of settlement. The 
sum of the amounts of the payments is then subtracted from the 
amount of the principal. $347.15 Wot '$ 78.75 
  
  275. Some states, e.g. New Hampshire and Vermont, 
have rules of their own for solving problems in partial 
payments. In such states it is left for the teacher to 
present the rule.

    BANKS AND BANKING 
276. @ bank is an institution that deals in money and 
— Credit is a promise to pay money in the future. 
The chief instruments of credit are checks, drafts, and 
notes.\ 
ao 
It is a mistake to say that banks deal only in money. Their most 
profitable business is in credit transactions. Banks, however, have a 
capital of their own which serves as a guarantee fund. Neither do 
all bank deposits represent money intrusted to banks by individuals. 
Most of them represent credit loaned to individuals by banks. Thus, 
if a bank accepts a promissory note for $5000, it may give in return 
a deposit credit for $5000 less the discount and will thereby add that 
sum to its deposits. 
277. frhere are several kinds of banks, among which 
are_national banks, organized under the National Banking 
Act of 1863 and the amendments that have been made 
thereto; state_banks, organized under the laws of the 
state in which they are situated; savings banks; and 
private-banks. K 
278. National banks are subject to rigorous supervision 
by federal authorities. All banks organized under state 
laws are subject to similar supervision by state authorities. 
279~The chief functions of banks are to receive deposits, 
to lend money on promissory notes, bonds, and mortgages, 
to discount merchants’ notes before they are due, and to 
buy, sell, and collect drafts or bills of exchange. National 
186
-P-A-G-E-187
  BANKS AND BANKING 187 
banks also issue bank notes which circulate as a medium 
of exchange.) Savings banks and a few others allow 
interest on deposits. 
280. On opening an account with a bank, the customer 
is usually given a pass book in which the dates and 
amounts of all deposits are entered on the credit side. If 
the customer wishes to draw money from the bank, or to 
pay a debt, he fills out a check similar to the following, i 
and the dates and amounts of all such checks are entered 
on the debit side of his pass book:

281. As in the case of promissory notes, checks may be

The same rules of indorsement apply. When the deposi-

283. If his financial standing is high, a person may 
| borrow money from a bank by giving his individual note. 
The bank may, however, ask for security. In this case the 
borrower must have some responsible person indorse the 
note, or he must deposit collateral security in the form of 
stocks, bonds, ete. 
  284. The following is a common form of a bank note: 
$2007 Detroit, Mich., sept. 6, 1904 
. Iiuree montha after date, J--- promise to pay 
  
  Gwo hundred and ™.-..--------------------+ Dollars 
at The Commercial Natl. Bank of Detroit, Mich., 
with interest at 6 per cent per annum until due, 
and seven per cent per annum thereafter until paid. 
Value received. 
facot. If. Rowe. 
  
If Mr. Rowe wishes to borrow $200 he takes the above note to 
the bank and, if necessary, either furnishes an indorser or collateral 
security, such as bonds, ete., which he assigns to the bank. If the 
bank authorities are satisfied, he receives $200 — $3 = $197, the 
interest for 3 mo. being deducted. This interest is called bank 
discount. Days of grace are now rarely used by bankers. 
285. In discounting notes, banks count forward by days 
or months as stated in the note and usually reckon 360 
days in the year. Thus, a note dated July 22 at 60 days 
will mature July 22+60 days, or Sept. 20. A note 
dated July 22 at 2 mo. will mature Sept. 22.

286. Business men frequently take notes due at some 
future date from their customers, and in case money is 
needed before the notes are due, sell them to a bank. 
(Such a note is shown on page 179.) The seller must 
give satisfactory security. The bank pays the sum due 
at maturity less the discount from the date of discount to 
the date of maturity. The sum paid by the bank is called 
the proceeds. These notes may or may not bear interest. 
The following examples will illustrate both cases:

287. The subject of exchange treats of methods of can- 
celing indebtedness between distant places without the 
actual transfer of money. This may be accomplished in 
any one of the following ways: 
(1) By Postal Money Order. Money orders may be sent 
for any amount from 1 ct. to $100. 
Identification by payee is necessary. In case of pay- 
ment to the wrong person, the government repays the 
loss. At present the rates charged are as follows: 
For orders for sums not exceeding $2.50 . . ... . 8cents. 
Tf over $2.50 and not exceeding $5.00 . . .. . Scents, 
Tf over $5.00 and not exceeding $10.00 . . .. . 8cents. 
Tf over $10.00 and not exceeding $20.00 . . . . . 10cents. 
If over $20.00 and not exceeding $30.00 . . « . . 12cents. 
If over $30.00 and not exceeding $40.00 . . . . « 15cents. 
If over $40.00 and not exceeding $50.00 . . . . . 18cents. 
If over $50.00 and not exceeding $60.00 . . . . . 20cents. 
If over $60.00 and not exceeding $75.00 . . . . . 25cents. 
If over $75.00 and not exceeding $100.00 . . . . . 80cents. 
(2) By Express Money Order. The rates are the same as 
for postal orders. The company is responsible for the 
payment to wrong persons. 
(8) By Telegraphic Money Order. Telegraph companies 
charge 1% of the amount sent, with a minimum charge 
of 25 ct., and double the charge for a 15-word message 
between the sending office and the office of the District 
Superintendent, through whose office the order is sent.

  194 EXCHANGE 
(4) By Check. A personal check on a home bank where 
the sender has money deposited can be sent. This check, 
when properly indorsed by the payee and presented at 
his bank, will probably be cashed without charge. The 
bank may charge a small fee, called exchange, for collecting. 
(5) By Bank Draft. ‘The ordinary form of bank draft 
is as follows: 
  
No. 42,786 
Central Sabings Bank 
g/358, Detroit, Mich., Sept. 6, 1905 
Pay to the order of famew /¥, Kaatle.-.---------- 
One hundred thirty-five and poe ee Dollars. 
To The Fourth National ol 
of the City of New York. 
H a Feorge MN. Case 
Cashier, 
  
The draft differs from the check in that it is drawn 
by one bank on another, while the check is drawn by an. 
individual on a bank where he has money deposited. 
288. Most banks keep money on deposit in some bank 
called a correspondence bank, in a large commercial center 
like New York or Chicago. 
If a customer of a local bank in the West wishes to pay a debt in 
the East, he buys a draft, signed by the cashier of the local bank, and 
drawn against the correspondence bank in New York City. This 
draft will pass as cash at any bank. The above draft is drawn by the 
Central Savings Bank of Detroit, and the correspondence bank is the 
Fourth National Bank of the City of New York. 
289. The following is another form of a draft, called 
the commercial draft.

American Book Co. draws the above sight draft payable to the order 
of the First National Bank of New York, and deposits it for collec- 
tion. The First National Bank sends it to a Detroit bank to collect. 
The Detroit bank demands payment of Hawkes & Co. If payment is 
made, the money is remitted to New York. If payment is refused, the 
draft is returned to the New York bank, and the American Book Co. 
is notified. Some other means of collecting must then be employed. 
290. If the account against Hawkes & Co. were not due 
for 60 days, the draft would read as follows: 
  
$ /000%% New York, Aug. 15, 1908. 
At sixty days sight pay to the order of First National

This draft is called a time draft and would be taken to Hawkes & Co. 
as before, who, if they intended to pay it, would write across the face 
in red ink: Accepted Aug. 21, 1908. 
Hawkes & Co. 
After writing these words across the draft, Hawkes & Co. have 
agreed to pay $1000, and the draft becomes the same as a promissory 
note. 
291. Fluctuations of Exchange. If the banks of San 
Francisco have sold drafts for a larger sum on the New 
York banks than they have on deposit in New York, it 
will be necessary to send money enough to New York to 
balance the account. The money is usually sent by ex- 
press at some expense, which must be borne by the pur- 
chaser of the drafts. In this case a draft on New York 
would cost slightly in excess of its face. This excess is 
called a premium. A draft sold at less than its face is said 
to be sold at a discount. 
Premiums and discounts are usually quoted as a per cent of the 
face of the draft. Thus, a quotation of 5% premium means that a 
draft for $100 may be purchased for $100.10. Sometimes the quota- 
tion is a certain amount per $1000. Thus, if New York exchange is 
quoted at $1.50 premium at New Orleans, a draft for $1000 will cost 
$1001.50. 
The above quotations refer to sight drafts. Time drafts are dis- 
counted by banks in the same manner as promissory notes. 
New York City is the greatest financial center of the United States, 
and so much business is transacted through the New York banks that 
New York exchange is generally at a premium. Consequently banks 
are always willing to cash such checks at par value. People in New 
York usually pay their indebtedness outside of the city by checks or 
drafts on New York banks, which find a ready sale at any bank. 
292. The Clearing House is an institution organized by 
the banks of every large city to facilitate settlement. of 
claims against one another,
-P-A-G-E-197
EXCHANGE 197 
Clerks from each bank bring daily to the clearing house the 
checks, ete., due them from all other associated banks, each. bank being 
represented by a separate package. Balances are struck between the 
credits and debits of each bank against all others, and the manager 
certifies the amount which each bank owes to the associated banks or 
is entitled to receive from them. The banks whose debits exceed 
their credits pay in the balance to the clearing house, which issues 
clearing house certificates to the banks whose credits exceed their 
debits. In the New York Clearing House, which is the largest in 
America, nearly sixty billion dollars of clearings were made in 1904, 
with only three billions of dollars of balances paid in money.

FOREIGN EXCHANGE 
293. Foreign exchange is the same in all essential fea- 
tures as domestic exchange, the difference being that 
exchange takes place between cities in different countries. 
294. A draft on a foreign country, usually called a bill 
of exchange, is payable in the currency of the country on 
which it is drawn. 
295. Foreign bills of exchange are generally written in 
duplicate, called a set of exchanges, and are of the follow- 
ing form:

The duplicate substitutes “second of exchange ” for “ first of ex- 
change” and “ first of same date” for “second of same date,” in the 
original. Either one being paid, the other becomes void. 
296. The par of exchange between two countries is the 
value of the monetary unit of one expressed in that of the 
other. Thus, the gold in the English pound is worth 
$4.8665. Exchange on Paris and other countries using 
the French monetary system is usually quoted at so many 
franes to the dollar, sometimes at so many cents to the 
franc. The par of exchange is about 5.184 francs to the 
dollar, or 19.3 cents to the franc. Exchange on Germany 
is quoted at so many cents on 4 marks. The par of ex- 
change is 95.2; quoted in cents per mark it is 23.8.

  STOCKS AND BONDS 
297. A corporation or stock company is an association of 
individuals under the laws of a state for the purpose of 
transacting business as one person. Large-scale produc- 
tion is‘now usually conducted by corporations. 
A corporation is managed by officers elected by a board of directors 
who are chosen by the stockholders, each stockholder having as many 
votes as he owns shares of stock. The capital stock is divided into a 
certain number of shares, the par value of which is determined by the 
number of shares into which the stock is divided. Thus, a capital 
stock of $50000 may be divided into 500 shares of $100 each, or 2000 
shares of $25 each, ete. Stockholders may own any number of shares 
and participate in the profits according to the number of shares they 
own. 
298. If a company is prosperous and makes more than 
its expenses, a dividend is paid to the stockholders. The 
dividend is usually a certain per cent of the par value of 
the stock, or sometimes so many dollars per share. If the 
rate of dividend is higher than the current rate of interest, 
there usually will be a demand for the stock and it will 
sell at a premium. If the rate of dividend is lower, the 
demand will be slight and the stock will sell at a discount. 
299. Companies frequently issue two kinds of stock, preferred and 
common. The holders of preferred stock are entitled to first share in 
the net earhings of the corporation up to a certain amount, usually 
from 5% to 7% of the par value. - The holders of common stock are 
entitled to a share, or all of what is left after the dividend on the 
preferred stock is paid. 
200
-P-A-G-E-201
  STOCKS AND BONDS 201 
Stock is sometimes issued to the stockholders of a corporation 
without a corresponding increase in the value of the property. Such 
stock is called watered stock. A ‘corporation’ may, be prohibited by 
its charter, or by law, from paying dividends in excess of a certain 
amount. Thus, if a corporation with a capital stock of $100000 
makes $16000 and wishes to pay this amount in dividends, but is 
prohibited from paying more than 8 %, watered stock, equal in amount ~ 
to the capitalization of the corporation, may be issued to the stock- 
holders and an 8% dividend (= $ 16000) may be declared upon this 
new basis. 
300. Since it is difficult for individuals to buy and sell 
stock personally, the business is usually transacted through 
a stock broker, who charges a small per cent, called broker- 
age (usually $%), of the par value of the stock bought or 
sold. The stock broker generally belongs to an organi- 
zation called a stock exchange. The New York Stock 
Exchange is the most important in America. 
301. Generally each stockholder is responsible only to the extent 
of the par value of the stock he owns. In the case of national banks, 
however, a stockholder is liable to the amount of the par value of his 
stock in addition to the amount paid for the purchase of the stock. 
302. Investors often buy stocks and hold them for the dividend 
they yield. Speculators buy them to sell at a profit. Speculators 
usually buy on a margin, that is, they pay only a part of the purchase 
price and borrow the rest by depositing the certificate of stock as 
collateral. A man who buys stock on a 20-point margin pays down 
20% of the par value and borrows the rest. A “bull” is a buyer of 
stocks which he hopes to sell at a profit. He acts on the belief that 
prices will go up. A “bear” is a seller of stocks which he does not 
possess, but borrows on the belief that prices will go down. Thus, if 
a stock is quoted at 50, a.“ bear,” thinking it will go down to 45, may 
sell at 50, and deliver borrowed stock to the purchaser. If the stock 
goes down to 45, he will purchase it and return it to the owner, thus 
realizing a profit of 5 points. This is called selling stocks “short.” 
Bears are said to be “short” of stock and bulls “long.”  
-P-A-G-E-202
  202 STOCKS AND BONDS 
303. When for any reason a stock company finds the 
amount of money paid in by stockholders insufficient, it 
generally borrows money and issues bonds, secured by a 
mortgage on the property of the company. These bonds 
are written agreements to pay a certain sum of money 
within a stated time and at a fixed rate of interest. Bonds 
have a prior claim over any kind of stock. 
304. National governments, states, counties, and cities 
often issue bonds, but without mortgages, the credit of 
such organization being considered good. 
Registered bonds are issued in the name of the owner, and are 
made payable to him or his assignee. Interest, when due, is sent 
direct to the owner. 
Coupon bonds are payable to bearer, and have small interest coupons 
attached, which are cut off when due, and the amount of interest is 
collected either personally, or through a bank. There is a coupon for 
each interest period. 
Bonds are usually named from the rate of interest they bear, or 
from the date at which they.are payable. Thus, Union Pacific 4’s 
means Union Pacific bonds bearing 4% interest. U.S. 4’s reg. 1907 
means United States registered bonds bearing 4% interest and due in 
1907. Western Union 7’s coup. 1900 means Western Union coupon 
bonds bearing 7% interest and due in 1900.

stocks and bonds on a certain day. The daily newspaper

306. Quotations are usually made at a certain per cent 
of the par value of the stock or bond. Thus, the quota- 
tion of 723 for Amalgamated Copper means 723% of the 
par value of one share. The purchaser must pay his broker 
7224+ 4= 724, and the seller will receive from his broker 
723 —4= 728. 
307. In the following examples the par value of a share 
will be taken as $100 unless otherwise stated. Brokerage 
at 4% must be taken into account in each case where not 
otherwise stated. 
Ex.1. A person buys 100 shares of A. T. and S. F. as 
quoted above, and sells 6 mo. later for 854, having received 
a dividend of 2%. Does he gain or lose, and how much, 
money being worth 6% per annum? 
Solution. Each share costs 833 + 4 = 833, 
and is sold for 854 —4= 85. 
.. the gain on each share is 85 — 833 = 1, or $1.50. 
«. the gain on 100 shares is 100 x $1.50 = $150. 
The dividend received = 2% of $10000 = $200. 
.. the total gain is $150 + $200 = $350. 
The amount invested is 100 x $833 = $8350. 
The interest for 6 mo. is } of 6% of $8350 = $250.50. 
=. $350 — $250.50 = $99.50 = the net gain.

INSURANCE 
308. There are two. general classes of insurance: in- 
surance on the person in the form of life, endowment, 
accident, and health insurance, and insurance on property 
in the form of fire, marine, live stock, tornado, plate glass, 
boiler insurance, insurance against bad debts, ete. 
PROPERTY INSURANCE 
309. The principal kinds of property insurance are fire 
insurance, or insurance against loss by fire; marine insur- 
ance, or insurance against loss of vessels at sea, or property 
on board of vessels at sea; tornado insurance, or insurance 
against loss by storms, etc. 
310. The written agreement between the company and. 
the person insured is called the policy, and the sum to be 
paid by the company in case of loss, the face of the policy. 
The person insured is called the insured, and the amount 
paid by the insured to the company for insurance, the 
premium. 
311. The premium is usually computed as a certain per 
cent of the face of the policy, or as a certain sum on each 
$100 of insurance. In either case it is called the rate.of 
insurance. 
Ex. A house valued at $5000 is insured for 4 of its 
value at 1.1% per annum. What is the annual premium?

-P-A-G-E-208
  208 INSURANCE 
How much would the owner lose if the house were burned 
after seven premiums had been paid? How much would 
the company lose ? 
Solution. Valuation of house is ¢ of $5000 = $4000. 
Premium = 11% of $4000 = $44. 
Loss of owner = $5000 — $4000 + 7 x $44 = $1308. 
Loss of company = $4000 — 7 x $44 = $3692. 
The above rate of insurance might have been stated as 
$1.10 on each $100 insured.

LIFE AND ACCIDENT INSURANCE 
312. Life insurance is an agreement to pay to the heirs 
of a person a specified sum upon his death. 
313. Endowment insurance is an agreement to pay a 
specified sum to the person insured if living at the end of 
a definite period of years, or to his heirs in case of death 
within that period. 
314. Accident insurance is an agreement to pay the 
person insured a weekly indemnity for loss of time while 
incapacitated from accident, or a fixed amount in case of 
permanent injury, such as the loss of both hands, both feet, 
the entire sight of the eyes, etc., or a fixed amount to his 
heirs in case of death by accident. 
315. Health insurance is an agreement to pay a weekly 
sum in case of sickness from specified diseases. In addi- 
tion to the weekly indemnity, health insurance sometimes 
‘guarantees the payment of all doctor’s fees and special 
amounts to cover cost of surgical operations. 
316. The following tables show the annual rates per 
$1000 charged by one of the leading life insurance com- 
panies doing business in the United States. These rates 
-are for life and endowment policies. Insurance companies 
also issue rates payable semiannually or quarterly. Such 
rates are slightly in advance of the annual rate, due to the 
fact that interest is charged on the amounts not paid at 
the time when the whole premium is due.

LIFE AND ACCIDENT INSURANCE 213 
The premiums on life policies are to be paid during the entire life 
of the insured, or during the period indicated in the preceding table. 
The face of the policy is to be paid at the death of the insured. The 
endowment policy provides for the payment of the face of the policy in 
10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, or 40 yr. from the date of issue, or at the death 
ot the insured if it occurs before the close of the stated period. 
317. The premiums charged by the life insurance com 
panies are determined by three considerations: (1) the 
probability that the insured will live as long as a healthy 
person of his age may be expected to live; (2) the rate of 
interest the company can earn on the premiums paid in; 
(8) the necessary expense of managing the company. 
In order to secure safety of the policy contract, premiums are made 
higher than the above considerations render necessary. The portion 
of the premium remaining unused at the end of any year may be 
returned to the policy holder in the form of an annual dividend, or it 
may be allowed to accumulate for a term of years, called the accumu- 
lation period. The period is usually 10, 15, or 20 years. In the latter 
case, no dividend is paid unless the policy is kept in force to the end 
of the accumulation period. 
The excess of assets over liabilities due to accumulated dividends, 
interest earned, etc., forms the surplus of the company. The reserve 
of a company is the amount held to meet the payment of policies 
when due. 
Great care is taken by life insurance companies to protect the in- 
sured against forfeiture through nonpayment of premiums. 
318. The following tables illustrate the loan value, or the amount 
the company agrees to loan the insured if the policy is assigned to the 
company as security; the cash value, or the amount the company 
agrees to pay the insured on surrender of the policy; the paid-up 
policy, or the face of a paid-up policy the company agrees to exchange 
for the original policy if surrendered; the extended insurance, or the 
time the company will continue the full amount of insurance without 
further payment. These privileges are granted in consideration of 
the premiums already paid.

325. An arithmetical progression (A.P.) is a series in 
which each term differs from the preceding by a constant 
quantity called the common difference. 
Thus, 2, 5, 8, 11, ---, and 15, 10, 5,0, — 5, — 10, -.-, are arithmetical 
progressions. In the first, 3 is the common difference and is added 
to each term to form the next; in the second, —5 is the common 
difference and is added to each term to form the next. 
326. A geometrical progression (G. P.) isa series in which 
each term after the first is derived by multiplying the pre- 
ceding term by a constant multiplier called the ratio. 
Thus, 2, 4, 8, 16, ---, and 18, — 6, 2, — 3, 3, --., are geometrical pro- 
gressions, the ratios being respectively 2 and — }. 
327. Last Term. If a is the first term, 7 the last term, 
d the common difference, 7 the ratio, and the number of 
terms, we have from the definitions, —

20 332. Many simple arithmetical operations 
can be performed by the use of two columns 
of numbers, as given in the annexed table. 
The left-hand column is formed by writing unity at 
the top and doubling each number to get the next. The 
right-hand column is formed by writing opposite each 
power of 2, the index of the power. Thus 512 = 2°, the 
number opposite 512 indicating the power of 2 used to 
produce 512. 
Ex. 1. Multiply 4096 by 64. 
From the table 4096 = 277 and 64 = 28, 
-*. 4096 x 64 = 212 x 26 = 21246 — 218 — 962144 (from 
table). 
The student should notice that the simple operation 
of addition is substituted for multiplication, the product, 
being found in the left-hand column opposite 18, the 
sum of 12 and 6. 
Ex. 2. Divide 1048576 by 2048. 
1048576 + 2048 = 27 + Ql — 220-11 — 29 — 512 (subtraction takes the 
place of division).

Ee, 3, Find V32768. 
V32768 = V215 = 2* = 23 -*8 (division takes the place of evolu- 
tion). 2 
In the preceding table the numbers in the right-hand 
column are called the logarithms of the corresponding 
numbers in the left-hand column. 2 is called the base of 
this system. Therefore, the logarithm of a number is the 
exponent by which the base is affected to produce the number. 
333. Any other base than 2 might have been used and 
columns similar to the above formed. In practice 10 is 
always taken as the base and the logarithms are called 
common logarithms in distinction from the natural loga- 
rithm, of which the base is 2.71828. Common logarithms 
are indices, positive or negative, of the power of 10. 
From the definition of common logarithms, it follows that since 
10°=1, log1=0. 10 01s logge = 8 
101=10, log10=1 102=0.01, log 0.01 =—2. 
102= 100, log 100 =2. 10-8 = 0.001, log 0.001 = — 3. 
10% = 1000, log 1000 = 3. 10~* = 0.0001, log 0.0001 = — 4. 
etc. etc.     
334. Since most numbers are not exact powers of 10, 
logarithms will in general consist of an integral and deci- 
mal part. Thus, since log 100 = 2 and log 1000 = 3, the 
logarithms of numbers between 100 and 1000 will lie 
between 2 and 3, or will be 2+ a fraction. Also since 
log 0.01 = —2 and log 0.001 = — 3, the logarithms of all 
numbers between 0.01 and 0.001 will lie between — 2 and 
— 8 or will be —3+4 a fraction. The integral part of the 
logarithm is called the characteristic and the decimal part 
the mantissa.
-P-A-G-E-226
  226 LOGARITHMS 
335. The characteristic of the logarithm of a number is 
independent of the digits composing the number, but 
depends on the position of the decimal point. Charac- 
teristics, therefore, are not given in the tables. Thus, 
since 246 lies between 100 and 1000, log 246 will lie 
between 2 and 3, or will be 2+ a fraction. Again 
since 0.0024 lies between 0.001 and 0.01, its logarithm 
lies between —3 and —2, or log 0.0024=—3+4 a 
fraction. 
336. From the above illustrations it readily appears 
that the characteristic of the logarithm of a number, partly 
or wholly integral, is zero or positive and one less than the 
number of figures in the integral part. 
337. The characteristic of the logarithm of a pure decimal 
is negative and one more than the number of zeros preceding 
the first significant figure. 
EXERCISE 77 
1. Determine the characteristic of the logarithm of 2; 
526; 75.34; 0.0005 ; 300.002; 0.05743. 
2. If log 787 = 2.8960, what are the logarithms of 7.87, 
0.0787, 78700, 78.7 ? 
338. The mantissa of the logarithm of a number is 
independent of the position of the decimal point, but 
depends on the digits composing the number. Mantissas 
are always positive and are found in the tables, for moy- 
ing the decimal point is equivalent to multiplying the 
number by some integral power of 10, and therefore adds 
to or subtracts from the logarithm an integer. 
   
-P-A-G-E-227
  LOGARITHMS 227 
Thus, log 76.42 = log 76.42, 
log 764.2 = log 76.42 x 10 = log 76.42 + 1, 
log 7642 = log 76.42 x 10? = log 76.42 + 2, 
log 7.642 = log 76.42 x 10-1 = log 76.42 +(—1).   
  So that the mantissas of all numbers composed of the digits 7642 
in that order are the same, since moving the decimal point affects the 
characteristic alone. 
Log 0.0063 is never written — 3 + 7993, but 3.7993. 
The minus sign is written above to indicate that the 
characteristic alone is negative. To avoid negative 
characteristics 10 is added and subtracted. Thus, 3.7993 
= 7.7993 — 10. 
339. The principles used in working with logarithms 
are as follows : 
I. The logarithm of a product equals the sum of the 
logarithms of the factors. 
Il. The logarithm of a quotient equals the logarithm of 
the dividend minus the logarithm of the divisor. 
Ill. The logarithm of a power equals the index of the 
power times the logarithm of the number. 
IV. The logarithm of a root equals the logarithm of the 
number divided by the index of the root. 
For let 10*=nand1ld¥=™m, 
then log n= xz and log m=y. 
Therefore, sinee mn = 10*+», 
log mn = x + y = log n + log m;

USE OF TABLES 
840. In the tables here given the mantissas are found 
correct to but four decimal places. By using these tables 
results can generally be relied upon as correct to 3 figures 
and usually to 4. If a greater degree of accuracy is 
required, five-place or even seven-place tables must be 
used.

USE OF TABLES 229 
at the top or bottom of the page, as convenient, find the 
third figure. The mantissa of the number will be found 
at the intersection of the row containing the first two 
figures and the column containing the third figure. 
Ex. Find log 884. 
The characteristic is 2 (Why?). In the column N find 38 and in 
row N find 4. The mantissa 5843 will be found at the intersection of 
the row 38 and column 4. 
. log 384 = 2.5843. 
What is log 3.84? log 38.4? log 0.0384? 
(2) When the number consists of more than three figures. 
Find as above the mantissa of the logarithm of the 
number consisting of the first three figures. To correct 
for the remaining figures interpolate by assuming that, for 
differences small as compared with the numbers, the differ- 
ences between numbers are proportional to the differences 
between their logarithms. This statement is only approxi- 
mately true, but its use leads to results accurate enough 
for ordinary computations. 
Ex. Find log 3847. 
Mantissa of log 3850 = 5855. 
Mantissa of log 3840 = 5843. 
10 0.0012.   
Mantissa of log 3847 = 5843 + y'5 of 0.0012 = 5851. 
The difference between 3840 and 3850 is 10, the difference between 
the mantissas of their logarithms (5855 — 5843) is 0.0012. Assuming 
that each increase of 1 unit between 3840 and 3850 produces an in- 
crease of 1 tenth of the difference in the mantissas, the addition for 
3847 will be 7 tenths of 0.0012 or 0.00084. 5843 + 0.00084 = 5851. 
Therefore, the mantissa of log 3847 = 5851.

3. Find log 0.04253. 
842. To find the number corresponding to a given 
logarithm. 
The number corresponding to a logarithm is called the 
antilogarithm. 
The characteristic determines the position of the deci- 
mal point. 
| (1) Sf the mantissa is found in the tables, the number is 
found at once. 
4 Ex. 1. Find antilog 3.5877. 
The mantissa is found at the intersection of column 7 and row 38. 
«. antilog 3.5877 = 3870. 
(2) If the exact mantissa is not found in the tables, 
the first three figures of the corresponding number can 
be found and to them can be annexed figures found by 
interpolation. 
_ Hx. 2. Find antilog 3.5882. 
log 3880 = 8.5888 log required number = 3.5882 
log 3870 = 3.5877 log 3870 = 3.5877 
10 0.0011 log req. no. — log 8870 = 0.0005 
3870 + (a of 10) = 874.544. 
The two mantissas in the table nearest to the given mantissa are 
5888 and 5877 differing by 0.0011. Their corresponding numbers, 
since the characteristic is 3, are 83880 and 3870, differing by 10. The 
 
-P-A-G-E-233
  USE OF TABLES : 233 
difference between the smaller mantissa 5877 and the required man- 
tissa 5882 is 0.0005. Since an increase of 11 ten thousandths in 
mantissas corresponds to an increase of 10 in the numbers, an increase 
of 5 ten thousandths in mantissas may be assumed to correspond to 
an increase of ,, of 10 in the numbers. Therefore the number is 
3870 + (8 of 10) = 3874.54+. 
EXERCISE 80 
1. Find antilog 2.9445 ; antilog 2.4065. 
2. Find antilog 1.6527 ; antilog 3.7779. 
3. Find antilog 1.9994; antilog 0.7320. 
843. The cologarithm of a number is the logarithm of 
its reciprocal. The cologarithm of 100 equals the loga- 
rithm of 745, te. —2. As the cologarithm of a number 
equals the logarithm with its sign changed, adding the 
cologarithm will give the same result as subtracting the 
logarithm. The former is sometimes more convenient. 
Since log 1=0,.. log = log 1 — log n=0 — log n, n 
therefore colog n = — log n. 
To avoia negative results it is often more convenient to add and 
subtract 10. 
Then colog n = 10 — log n — 10. 
Ex. 1. Find colog 47.3. 
log 1 = 10.0000 —10 
log 47.3 = 1.6749 
colog 47.3 = 8.3251 — 10 
In subtracting 1.6749 or any other logarithm from 10, the result 
may be obtained mentally by subtracting the right hand figure from 
10 and ali the others from 9.

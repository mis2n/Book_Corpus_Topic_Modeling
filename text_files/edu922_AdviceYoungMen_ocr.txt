INTRODUCTION 
1. Ir is the duty, and ought to be the pleasure, of 
age and experience to warn and instruct youth and to 
come to the aid of inexperience. When sailors have 
discovered rocks or breakers, and have had the good 
luck to escape with life from amidst them, they, unless 
they be pirates or barbarians as well as sailors, point 
out the spots for the placing of buoys and of lights, 
in order that others may not be exposed to the 
danger which they have so narrowly escaped. What 
man of common humanity, having, by good luck, 
missed being engulfed in a quagmire or quicksand, 
will withhold from his neighbours a know] of the 
peril without which the dangerous spots are not to 
be approached ? 
2. The great effect which correct opinions and 
sound principles, imbibed in early life, together with 
the good conduct, at that age, which must naturally 
result from such opinions and principles; the t 
effect which these have on the whole course of our 
lives is, and must be, well known to every man of 
common observation. How many of us, arrived at 
only forty years, have to repent; nay, which of us 
has not to repent, or has not had to repent, that he 
did not, at an earlier age, possess a great stock of 
knowledge of that kind which has an immediate 
effect on our personal ease and happiness ; that kind 
of knowledge, upon which the cheerfulness and the 
harmony of our homes depend !

ledge, in particular, that this work is intended; 
knowledge, indeed, relative to education, to many 
sciences, to trade, agriculture, horticulture, law, 
ernment, and religion; knowledge relating, inci- 
tally, to all these; but, the main object is to 
furnish that sort of knowledge to the young which 
but few men acquire until they be old, when it comes 
too late to be useful. .

two years of imprisonment, heavy fines, three years 
self-banishment to the other side of the Atlantic, and 
a total breaking of fortune, so as to be left without a 
bed to lie on, and, during these twenty-nine years of 
troubles and of punishments, writing and publishing, 
every week of my life, whether in exile or not, eleven 
weeks only excepted, a periodical paper, containing 
more or less of matter worthy of public attention ; 
writing and publishing, during the same twenty-nine 
years, & grammar of the French and another of the 
English language, a work on the Economy of the 
Cottage, a work on Forest Trees and Woodlands, a 
work on Gardening, an account of America, a book 
of Sermons, a work on the Corn-plant, a History of 
the Protestant Reformation ; all vooks of great and 
continued sale, and the last unquestionably the book 
of greatest circulation in the whole world, the Bible 
only excepted ; having, during these same twenty-nine 
years of troubles and embarrassments without number, 
introduced into England the manufacture of Straw- 
plat; also several valuable trees; having introduced, 
during the same twenty-nine years, the cultivation of 
the Corn-plant, so manifestly valuable as a source of 
food; having, during the same period, always (whether 
in exile or not) sustained a shop of some size, in 
London; having, during the whole of the same period, 
never employed less, on an average, than ten persons, 
in some capacity or other, exclusive of printers, book- 
binders, and others, connected with papers and 
books ; and having, during these twenty-nine years of 
troubles, embarrassments, prisons, fines, and banish-

and woman’s state.

leadly enemy. Yet, at this moment, i¢ will not be 
pretended, that there is another ™an in the kingdom, who has so many cordial friends. Yor as to the 
i of minisiers and the great, the friendship 
is towards the power, the influence; it is, in_ fact, 
towards those taxes, of which so many thousands are 
gaping to get at a share. And, if we could, through 
so thick a veil, come at the naked fact, we should 
find the subscription, now going on in Dublin for the 
purpose of erecting a monument in that city, to com- 
memorate the good recently done, or alleged to be 
done, to Ireland, by the Duxe of WeELiNcTon ; we 
should find, that the subscribers have the tames in 
view; and that, if the monument shall actually be 
raised, it ought to have selfishness, and not gratitude, 
engraven on its base. Nearly the same may be said 
with regard to all the praises that we hear bestowed 
on men in power. The friendship which is felt to- 
wards me is pure and disinterested : it is not founded 
in any hope that the parties can have, that they 
can ever profit from professing it: it is founded on 
the gratitude which the entertain for the good that 
I have done them; and, of this sort of friendship, 
and friendship so cordial, no man ever possessed a 
larger portion. 
. Now, mere genius will not acquire this for a 
man. There must be something more than genius :
-P-A-G-E-9
INTRODUCTION a 
there must be industry: there must be perseverance: 
there must be, before the eyes of the nation, proofs of 
extraordinary exertion: people must say to them- 
selves, ‘ What wise conduct must there have been in 
the employing of the time of this man! How sober, 
how. sparing in diet, how early a riser, how little 
expensive he must have been!’ These are: the 
things, and not genius, which have caused my labours 
to be so incessant and so successful: and, though I 
do not affect to believe, that every young man, who 
shall read this work, will become able to perform 
labours of equal magnitude and importance, I do pre- 
tend, that every young man, who will attend to my 
advice, will become able to perform a great deal more 
than men generally do perform, whatever may be his 
situation in life; and, that he will, too, perform it 
with greater ease and satisfaction than he would, 
without the advice, be able to perform the smaller 
portion. 
7. Lhave had, from thousands of young.men, and 
men advanced in years also, letters of thanks for the 
great benefit which they have derived from. my 
labours. Some have thanked me for my Grammars, 
some for my Cottage Economy, others for the Wood- 
lands and the Gardener; and, in short, for every one 
of my works have I received letters of thanks from 
numerous persons, of whom I had never heard before. 
In many cases I have been told, that, if the parties 
had had my books to read some years before, the 
gain to them, whether in time or in other things, 
would have been very great. Many, and a great 
many, have told me, that, though long at school, and 
though their parents had paid for their being taught 
English Grammar, or French, they had, in a short 
time, learned more from my books, on those subjects, 
than they had learned, in years, from their teachers.

8 INTRODUCTION 
How many gentlemen have thanked me, in the 
strongest terms, for my Woodlands and Gardener, 
observing (just as Lord Bacon had observed in his 
time) that they had before seen no books, on these 
subjects, that, they could wnderstand! But, I know 
not of anything that ever gave me more satisfaction 
than I derived from the visit of a gentleman of 
fortune, whom I had never heard of before, and who, 
about four years ago, came to thank me in person 
for a complete reformation, which had been worked 
in his son by the reading of my two sERMoNs on 
drinking and on gaming. 
8. I have, therefore, done, already, a great deal in 
this way: but, there is still wanting, in a compact 
form, a body of Apvicr such as that which I now 
Bropose to give: and in the giving of which [ shall 
ivide my matter as follows. 1. Advice addressed to 
a Youru; 2. Advice addressed to a Bacuexor; 
8. Advice addressed to a Lover; 4. To a Hus- 
sand; 5. To a Farner; 6. To a Crmzen or 
Sunsxcr. 
9. Some persons will smile, and others laugh out- 
right, at the idea of ‘Cobbett’s giving advice for 
conducting the affairs of love” Yes, but I was once 
young, and surely I may say with the poet, I forget 
which of them, 
‘Though old I am, for ladies’ love unfit, 
The power of beauty I remember yet.’ 
I forget, indeed, the names of the ladies as completely, 
pretty nigh, as I do that of the poets; but I remember 
their influence, and of. this influence on the conduct 
and in the affairs and on the condition of men, I 
have, and must have, been a witness all my life long. 
And, when we consider in how great a de, the 
happiness of all the remainder of a man’s life depends,
-P-A-G-E-11
INTRODUCTION 9 
and always must depend, on his taste and judgment in the character of a lover, this may well be con- sidered as the most important period of the whole term of his existence. . 
10. In my address to the Hesnaxp, F shall, of course, introduce advice relative to the important duties of masters and servants; duties of great im- 
portance, whether considered as affecting families or 
as affecting the community. In my address to the 
Crrvzw~ or Sunsecr, I shall consider all the reci- 
procal duties of the governors and the governed, and 
also the duties which man owes to his neighbour. It 
would be tedious to attempt to lay down rules for 
conduct exclusively applicable to every distinct call- 
ing, profession, and condition of life; but, under the 
above-described heads, will be conveyed every species 
of advice of which I deem the utility to be unques- 
tionable. 
11. I have thus fully described the nature of my 
little work, and, before I enter on the first Letter, 7 
venture to express a hope, that its good effects will be 
felt long after its author shall have ceased to exist.

LETTER I 
TO A YOUTH 
12. You are now arrived at that age which the 
law thinks sufficient to make an oath, taken by you, 
valid in a court of law. Let us suppose from four- 
teen to nearly twenty; and, reserving, for a future 
occasion, my remarks on your duty towards parents, 
let me here offer you my advice as to the means 
likely to contribute Jargel towards making you a 
happy man, useful to al about you, and an honour 
to those from whom you sprang. 
13. Start, I beseech you, with a conviction firmly 
fixed on your mind, that you have no right to live in 
this world ;- that, being of hale body and sound mind, 
you have no right to any earthly existence, without 
doing work of some sort or other, unless you have 
ample fortune whereon to live clear of debt; and, 
that even in that case, you have no right to breed 
children, to be kept by others, or to be exposed to 
the chance of being so kept. Start with this con- 
viction thoroughly implanted on your mind, To 
wish to live on the labour of others is, besides the 
folly of it, to contemplate a fraud at the least, and, 
under certain circumstances, to meditate oppression 
and robbery. 
14. I suppose you in the middle rank of life. 
Cappiness ought to be your great object, and it is 
to be found only in independence. Turn your back 
on Whitehall and on Somerset-House ; leave the Cus- 
toms and Excise to the feeble and low-minded ; look
-P-A-G-E-13
COBBETT’S ADVICE TO A YOUTH 11 
not for success to favour, to partiality, to friendship, 
or to what is called interest: write it on your heart, 
that you will depend solely on your own merit and 
your own exertions. Think not, neither, of any of 
those situations where gaudy habiliments and.sound- 
ing titles poorly disguise from the eyes of good sense 
the mortifications and the heart-ache of slaves. 
Answer me not by saying, that these situations 
‘must be filled by somebody ;’ for, if I were to admit 
the truth of the proposition, which I do not, it 
would remain for you to show that they are con- 
ducive to happiness, the contrary of which has been 
proved to me by the observation of a now pretty 
long life. 
15. Indeed, reason tells us, that it must he thus: 
for that which a man owes to favour or to partiality, 
that same favour or partiality is constantly liable to 
take from him. He who lives upon anything except 
his own labour, is incessantly surrounded by rivals : 
his grand resource is that servility in which he’ is 
always liable to be surpassed. .He is in daily danger 
of being out-bidden ; his very bread depends upon 
caprice; and he lives in a state of uncertainty and 
never-ceasing fear. His is not, indeed, the dog’s life, 
‘hunger and idleness;’ but it is worse; for it is 
‘idleness with slavery,’ the latter being the just price 
of the former, Slaves frequently are well fed and 
well clad; but slaves dare not speak; they dare not 
be suspected to think differently from their masters: 
hate his acts as much as they may. be he tyrant, 
be he drunkard, be he fool, or be he all three at 
once, they must be silent, or, nine times out of ten, 
affect approbation: though possessing a thousand 
times his knowledge, they must feign a conviction of 
his superior understanding ; though knowing that 
it is they who, in fact, do all that he. is paid. for
-P-A-G-E-14
12 COBBETT’S ADVICE [Letter 
doing, it is destruction to them to seem as if they 
thought any portion of the service belonged to them ! 
Far from me be the thought, that any youth who 
shall read this page would not rather perish than 
submit to live in a state like this! Such a state is 
fit only for the refuse of nature; the halt, the half- 
blind, the unhappy creatures whom nature has marked 
out for degradation. 
16. And how comes it, then, that we see hale and 
even clever youths voluntarily bending their necks 
to this slavery; nay, pressing forward in eager rival- 
ship to assume the yoke that ought to be insupport- 
able? The cause, and the only cause, is, that the 
deleterious fashion of the day has created so many 
artificial wants, and has raised the minds of young 
men so much above their real rank and state of life, 
that they look scornfully on the employment, the 
fare, and the dress, that would become them; and, 
in order to avoid that state in which they might live 
free and happy, they become showy slaves. 
17, The great source of independence, the French 
express in a precept of three words, ‘ Viore de peu,’ 
which I have always very much admired. ‘ To live 
upon little’ is the great security against slavery ; and 
this precept extends to dress and other things besides 
food and drink. When Doctor Jonnson wrote his 
Dictionary, he put in the word pensioner thus: 
_Tesstonsn— A slave of state” After this he him- 
sel me a pensioner! And thu: eably to 
his own definition, he lived and died "a. slaw of 
state!” What must this man of great genius, and of great industry too, have felt at receiving this pen- 
sion! Could he be so callous as not to feel a pang upon seeing his own name placed before his own degrading definition? And what could induce him to submit to this? His wants, his artificial wants,
-P-A-G-E-15
q TO A YOUTH 13 
his habit of indulging in the pleasures of the table ; 
his disregard of the precept ‘ Vivre de peu.’ This 
was the cause; and, be it observed, that indulgences 
of this sort, while they tend to make men poor and 
expose them to commit mean. acts, tend also to 
enfeeble the body, and more especially to cloud and 
to weaken the mind. 
18. When this celebrated author wrote his Dic- 
tionary, he had not been debased by luxurious enjoy- 
ments; the rich and powerful had not caressed him 
into a slave; his writings then bore the stamp of 
truth and independence : but, having been debased 
by luxury, he who had, while content with plain fare, 
been the strenuous advocate of the rights of the 
people, became a strenuous advocate for taxation 
without representation ; and, in a work under the title 
of ‘ Taxation no Tyranny, defended, and greatly as- 
sisted to produce, that unjust and bloody war which 
finally severed from England that great country the 
United states of America, now the most powerful 
and dangerous rival that this kingdom ever had. 
The statue of Dr. Jonson was the first that was 
put into St. Paui’s Cuurcu! A signal warning to 
us not to look upon monuments in honour of the 
dead as a proof of their virtues; for here we see 
St. Paur’s Cuurcn holding up to the veneration of 
posterity a man whose own writings, together with 
the records of the pension list, prove him to have 
been ‘a slave of state. 
19. Endless are the instances of men of bright 
parts and high spirit having been, by degrees, ren- 
lered powerless and despicable, by their imaginary 
wants. Seldom has there been a man with fairer 
rospect of accomplishin; t things and of acquir- 
E fastin renews, than Guanes For: he had great 
ents of the most popular sort; the times ‘were

singularly favourable to an exertion of the™ with 
success; @ large part of the nation admired him and were his partisans ; he had, as to the great question between him-and his rival (Prrr), reason and justice clearly on. his side: but he had against him his squandering and luxurious habits: these made him dependent on the rich part of his isans 5, made his wisdom subservient to opulent folly or selfishness ; 
deprived his country of all the benefit that it might 
have derived from his talents ; and, finally, sent him 
to the grave without a single sigh from a people, 
a great part of whom would, in his earlier years, 
have wept at his death as at a national calamity. 
20. Extravagance in dress, in the haunting of play- 
houses, in horses, in everything else, is to be avoided, 
and, in youths and young men, extravagance in dress 
particularly, This sort of extravagance, this waste 
of money on the decoration of the body, arises 
solely from vanity, and from vanity of the most 
contemptible sort. It arises from the notion, that 
all the people in the street, for instance, will be 
looking at you as soon as you walk out; and that 
they will, in a greater or less degree, think the better 
of you on account of your fine dress, Never was 
notion more false, the sensible people that 
happen to see you, will think nothing at a about 
you: those who are filled with the same vain notion 
as you are, will perceive your attempt to impose on 
them, and will despise you accordingly : rich people will wholly disregard you, and you will be envied and hated by those who have the same vanity that you have without the means of gratifying it.” Dress should be suited to 9 Your rank and station ; a surgeon or physician should not dress like a carpenter ! but there is no reason why a tradesman, a merchant’s 
clerk, or clerk of any kind, or why a shopkeeper or
-P-A-G-E-17
Y TO A YOUTH 15 
manufacturer, or even.a merchant ; no reason at all 
why any of these should dress in an expensive manner. 
It is a great mistake to suppose, that they derive am 
advantage from exterior decoration. Men are esti- 
mated by other men according to their capacity and 
willingness to be in some way or other useful; and 
though, with the foolish and vain part of women, 
fine clothes frequently do something, yet the greater 
part of the sex are much too penetrating to draw their 
conclusions solely from the outside show of a man: 
they look deeper, and find other criterions whereby 
to judge. And, after all, if the fine clothes obtain 
you a wife, will they bring you, in that wife, fru- 
gality, good sense, and that sort of attachment that 
is likely to be lasting? Natural beauty of person is 
quite another thing: this always has, it always will 
and must have, some weight even with men, and 
great weight with women. But this does not want 
to be set off by expensive clothes. Female eyes are, 
in such cases, very sharp: they can discover beauty 
though half hidden by beard and even by dirt and 
surrounded by rags: and, take this as a secret 
worth half a fortune to you, that women, however 
personally vain they may be themselves, despise 
personal vanity in men. 
21. Let your dress be as cheap as may be without 
shabbiness ; think more about the colour of your 
shirt than about the gloss or texture of ‘your coat ; 
be always as clean as your occupation will, without 
inconvenience, permit; but never, no, not for one 
moment, believe, that any human being, with sense 
in his skull, will love or respect you on account. of 
your fine or costly clothes. A great misfortune of 
the present day is, that every one is, in his own 
estimate, raised above his real state of life: every one 
seems to think himself entitled, if not to title and
-P-A-G-E-18
16 COBBETT’S ADVICE [Letter 
great estate, at least to live without work. This mis- 
chievous, this most destructive, way of thinking has, 
indeed, been produced, like almost all our other evils, 
by the Acts of our Septennial and Unreformed Par- 
liament. That body, by its Acts, has caused an 
enormous Debt to be created, and, in consequence, 
a prodigious sum to be raised annually in taxes. It 
has caused, by these means, a race of loan-mongers 
and stock-jobbers to arise. These carry on a species 
of gaming, by which some make fortunes in a day, 
and others, in a day, become beggars. ‘The unfortu- 
nate gamesters, like the purchasers of blanks in a 
lottery, are never heard of; but the fortunate ones 
become companions for lords, and some of them lords 
themselves. We have, within these few years, seen 
many of these gamesters get fortunes of a quarter of 
a million in a few days, and then we have heard 
them, though notoriously amongst the lowest and 
basest of human creatures, called ‘ honourable gentle- 
men’! In such a state of things, who is to expect 
patient industry, laborious study, fragality and care ; 
who, in such a state of things, is to expect these to be 
employed in pursuit of that competence which it is 
the laudable wish of all men to secure? Not long 
ago a man, who had served his time to a tradesman 
in London, became, instead of pursuing his trade, 
a stock-jobber, or gambler ; and, in about two years, 
drove his coach-and-four, had his town house and 
country house, and visited, and was visited by, peers 
of the highest rank! A fellow-apprentice of this 
lucky gambler, though a tradesman in excellent busi- 
ness, seeing no earthly reason why he should not 
have his coach-and-four also, turned his stock’ in 
trade into a stake for the Change ; but, alas! at the 
end of a few months, instead of being in a coach-and- 
four, he was in the Gazette !
-P-A-G-E-19
Tj TO A YOUTH 17 
22. This is one instance out of hundreds of thou- 
sands; not, indeed, exactly of the same description, 
but all arising from the same copious source. The 
words speculate and speculation have been substituted 
for gamble and gambling. The hatefulness of the 
pursuit is thus taken away; and, while taxes to the 
amount of more than double the whole of the rental 
of the kingdom; while these cause such crowds of 
idlers, every one of whom calls himself a gentleman, 
and avoids the appearance of working for his bread ; 
while this is the case, who is to wonder, that a great 
part of the youth of the country, knowing themselves 
to be as good, as learned, and as well-bred as these 
gentlemen ; who is to wonder, that they think, that 
they also ought to be considered as gentlemen? 
Then, the late war (also the work of the Septennial 
Parliament) has left us, amongst its many legacies 
such swarms of titled men and women; such swarms 
of ‘Sirs’ and their ‘ Ladies’; men and women who, only the other day, were the fellow-apprentices, 
fellow-tradesmen’s or farmers’ sons and. daughters, or 
indeed, the fellow-servants, of those who are now in 
these several states of life; the late Septennial Par- 
liament war has left us such swarms of these, that it is 
no wonder that the heads of young people are turned, 
and that they are ashamed of that state of life to 
act their part well in which ought to be their delight. 
23, But, though the cause of the evil is in Acts of 
the Septennial Parliament; though this universal 
desire in people to be thought to be above their 
station; though this arises from such acts; and, 
though it is no wonder that young men are thus 
turned from patient study and labour ; though these 
things be undoubted, they form no reason why I 
should not warn you against becoming a victim to 
this national scourge. For, in spite of every art 
CORBETT. ap. c

made use of to avoid labour, the taxes will, after all, 
maintain only so many idlers. We cannot all be 
‘knights’ and ‘gentlemen’: there must be a large 
pat of us, after all, to make and mend clothes and 
ouses, and carry on trade and commerce, and, in 
spite of all that we can do, the far greater part of us 
must actually work at something; for, unless we can 
get at some of the taxes, we fall under the sentence 
of Holy Writ, ‘He who will not work shall not cat.’ 
Yet, so strong is the propensity to be thought 
‘ gentlemen’; so general is this desire amongst the 
youth of this formerly laborious and unassumi 
nation; a nation famed for its pursuit of wealth 
through the channels of patience, punctuality, and 
integrity ; a nation famed for its love of solid acqui- 
sitions and qualities, and its hatred of everything 
showy and false : so general is this really fraudulent 
desire amongst the youth of this now ‘speculating’ 
nation, that thousands upon thousands of them are, 
at this moment, in a state of half starvation, not so 
much because they are too lazy to earn their bread, 
as because they are too proud! And what are the 
consequences ? Such a youth remains or becomes a 
burden to his parents, of whom he ought to be the 
comfort, if not the support. Always aspiring to 
something higher than he can reach, his life is a life 
of disappointment and of shame. If marriage bgfal 
him, it is a real affliction, involving others as well as 
himself.. His lot is a thousand times worse than that 
of the common labouring pauper. Nineteen times 
out of twenty a premature death awaits him: and, 
alas! how numerous are the cases in which that 
death is most miserable, not to say ignominious! 
Stupid pride is one of the symptoms of madness. Of 
the two madmen mentioned in Don Quixote, one 
thought himself Nerrunz, and the other Jurrrun.

Shakspeare agrees with Curvantes; for, Mad Tom, 
in King Lear, being asked who he is, answers, ‘I am 
a tailor run mad with pride. How many have we 
heard of, who claimed relationship with noblemen 
and kings ; while of not a few each has thought him- 
self the Son of God! 'To the public journals, and 
to the observations of every one, nay, to the ‘ county- 
lunatic asylums” (things never heard of in England 
till now), I appeal for the fact of the vast and 
hideous increase of madness in this country; and, 
within these vi few years, how many scores of 
oung men, who, if their minds had been unperverted 
by the gambling principles of the day, had a probably 
long and happy life before them; who talent, 
personal endowments, love of parents, love of friends, 
admiration of large circles ; who had, in short, every- 
thing to make life desirable, and who, from mortified 
pride, founded on false pretensions, have put an end 
to their own existence ! 
24. As to Drunxenness and Guvrrony, general 
so called, these are vices so nasty and beastly that 
deem any one capable of indulging in them to be 
wholly unworthy of my advice; and, if any youth 
unhappily initiated in these odious and debasing 
vices should happen to read what I am now writing, 
I refer him to the command of God, conveyed ta the 
Israelites by Moses, in Deuteronomy, chap. xxi. The 
father and mother are to take the son ‘and 
bring him to the elders of the city; and they shall 
say to the elders, This our son will not obey our 
voice : he is a glutton and a drunkard. And all the 
men of the city shall stone him with stones, that. he 
die” LI refer downright beastly gluttons and drunk- 
ards to this; but indulgence short, far short, of 
this gross and really nasty drunkenness and gluttony 
is to be deprecated, and that, too, with more

earnestness because it is too often looked upon as 
being no crime at all, and as having nothing blame- 
able in it; nay, there are many persons. who pride 
themselves on their refined taste in matters connected 
with eating and drinking: so far from being ashamed 
of employing their thoughts on the subject, it is 
their boast that they do it. St. Gregory, one of the 
Christian fathers, says: ‘It is not the quantity or the 
quality of the meat, or drink, but the love of it that 
is. condemned ;” that is to say, the indulgence beyond 
the absolute demands of nature ; the hankering after 
it; the neglect of some duty or other for the sake of 
the enjoyments of the table. 
25. This love of what are called ‘good eating and 
drinking,’ if very unamiable in grown-up persons, is 
perfectly hateful in a youth ; and, if he indulge in 
the propensity, he is already half ruined. To warn 
you against acts of fraud, robbery, and violence, is 
not my province ; that is the business of those who 
make and administer the law. I am not talking to 
you against acts which the jailor and the hangman 
punish; nor against those moral offences which all 
men condemn; but against indulgences, which, by 
men in general, are deemed not only harmless, but 
meritorious ; but which the observation of my whole 
life has taught me to regard as destructive to human 
happiness, and against which all ought to be cau- tioned even in their boyish days. I have been a t observer, and I can truly say, that I have never 
nown a man, ‘ fond of good eating and drinking,’ as 
it iscalled; that I have never known such a man (and hundreds I have known).who was worthy of respect. - 26. Such indulgences are, in the first place, very eapensive. The materials are. costly, and the pre- parations still more so. What a monstrous thing, that, in order to satisfy the appetite of a man, there

must be a person or two at work every day! More 
fuel, culinary implements, kitchen-room; what! all 
these merely to tickle the palate of four or five people, 
and especially people who can hardly pay their way ! 
And, then, the loss of time: the time spent-in pleas- 
ing the palate: it is truly horrible to behold people 
who ought to be at work, sitting, at the three meals, 
not less than three of the about fourteen hours that 
they are out of their beds! A youth, habituated to 
this sort of indulgence, cannot be valuable to any 
employer. Such a youth cannot be deprived of his 
table-enjoyments on any account: his eating and 
drinking form the momentous concern of his life: if 
business interfere with that, the business must give 
way. A young man, some years ago, offered himself 
to me, on a particular occasion, as an amanuensis, for 
which he appeared to be perfectly qualified. The 
terms were settled, and I, who wanted the job dis- 
itched, requested him to sit down, and begin; but 
e, looking out of the window, whence he could see 
the cure clock, said, somewhat hastily, ‘I cannot 
stop now, sir, I must go to dinner’ ‘Oh!’ said I, 
‘you must go to dinner, must you! Let the dinner, 
which you must wait upon to-day, have your constant 
services, then: for you and I shall never agree.’ He 
had told me that he was in great distress for want of 
employment; and yet, when relief was there before 
his eyes, he could forego it for the sake of getting at 
his eating and drinking three or four hours, perhaps, 
sooner than I should have thought it right for him 
to leave off work. Such a person cannot be sent from 
home, except at certain times; he must be near the 
kitchen at three fixed hours of the day; if he be 
absent more than four or five hours, he is ill-treated. 
In short, a youth thus pampered is worth nothing ss 
@ person to be employed in business. :

_ 27. And, as to friends and acquaintances; they 
will say nothing to you; they will offer you in- 
dulgences under their roofs ; but the more ready 
ou are to accept of their offers, and, in fact, the 
better taste you discover, the less they will like you, 
and the sooner they will find means of shaking you 
off; for, besides the cost which you occasion them, 
people do not like to have critics sitting in judgment 
on their bottles and dishes. Water-drinkers are 
universally laughed at ; but, it has always seemed to 
me, that they are amongst the most welcome of 
guests, and that, too, though the host be by no means 
of a niggardly turn. The truth is, they give no 
trouble ; they occasion no anmiety to please them ; 
they are sure not to make their sittings inconveniently 
long; and, which is the great thing of all, their 
example teaches moderation to the rest of the com- 
pany. Your notorious ‘lovers of good cheer’ are, 
on the contrary, not to be invited without due reflec- 
tion : to entertain one of them is a serious business ; 
and as people are not apt voluntarily to undertake 
such pieces of business, the well-known ‘lovers of 
good eating and drinking’ are left, very generally, to 
enjoy it by themselves and at their own expense.

most valuable of all earthly possessions, and without

to refrain from excess in eating and drinking, but 
-bids us to stop short of what might be indulged in 
without any apparent impropriety. The words of 
Eccrstasricus ought to be read once a week by 
every young person in the world, and particularly by 
the young people of this country at this time, ‘Eat 
modestly that which is set before thee, and devour 
not, lest thou be hated, When thou sittest amongst 
many, reach not thine hand out first of all. How

little is sufficient for man well taught! A wholesome 
sleep cometh of a temperate belly. Such a man riseth 
up in the morning, and is well at ease with himself. 
Be not too hasty of meats; for excess of meats 
bringeth sickness, and choleric disease cometh of 
gluttony. By surfeit have many perished, and he 
that dieteth himself prolongeth his fe Show not 
thy valiantness in wine; for wine hath destroyed 
many. Wine measurably taken, and in season, bringeth 
gladness and cheerfulness of mind; but drinking with 
excess maketh bitterness of mind, brawlings and scold- 
ings.’ How true are these words! How well worthy 
of a constant place in our memories! Yet, what 
pains have been taken to apologise for a life contrary 
to these precepts! And, good ¢ God! what punish- 
ment can be too great, what mark of infamy suffi- 
ciently signal, for those pernicious villains of talent, 
who have employed that talent in the composition of 
Bacchanalian songs ; that is to say, pieces of fine and 
captivating writing in praise of one of the most 
ous and destructive vices in the black catalogue 
of human depravity ! 
29. In the passage which I have just quoted from 
chap. xxxi. of Ecciestasticus, it is said, that ‘ wine, 
measurably taken, and in season,’ is a proper thing. 
This, and other such passages of the Old ‘Testament, 
have given a handle to drunkards, and to extravagant 
ple, to insist, that God intended that wine should 
be dommonly drunk. No doubt of that. But, then, 
he could intend this only in countries in which he had 
iven wine, and to which he had given no cheaper 
rink except water. If it be said, as it truly may, 
that, by the means of the sea and the winds, he has 
‘given wine to all countries, 1 answer that this gift 
is of no use to us now, because our government ste]

indeed, the case was different ; and, here I am about 
to give you, incidentally, a piece of historical know-~ 
ledge, which you will not have acquired from Hume, 
Go.psmiTH, or any other of the romancers called his- 
torians. Before that unfortunate event, the Protestant 
Reformation, as it is called, took place, the price of 
RED wine, in England, was fowrpence a gallon, Win- 
chester measure ; and of watrEe WINE, sixpence a gallon. 
At the same time the pay of a labouring man 
per day, as fixed by law, was fourpence. Now, 
when a labouring man could earn four quarts 9 
good wine in a day, it was, doubtless, allowable, 
even in England, for people in the middle rank of life 
to drink wine rather commonly; and, therefore, in 
those happy days of England, these passages of Scrip- 
ture were applicable enough. But, now, when we 
have got a Protestant government, which by the taxes 
which it makes people pay to it, causes the eighth 
part of a gallon of wine to cost more than the pay of 
a labouring man for a day; now, this passage of 
Scripture is not applicable to us. There is no ‘sea~ 
son” in which we can take wine without ruining our- 
selves, however ‘measurably’ we may take it; and 
I beg you to regard, as perverters of Scripture and 
as seducers of youth, all those who cite passages like 
that above cited, in justification of, or as an apology 
for, the practice of wine-drinking in England. 
. 80. T beseech you to look again and again at, and 
to remember every word of, the passage which I have 
just quoted from the book of Ecctxstasricus, How 
completely have been, and are, its words verified by 
my experience and in my persoxi! How little of eat- 
ing-and drinking is sufficient for me! How whole- 
some is my sleep! How early do I rise; and how 
‘well at case? am I ‘with myself!’ I should not 
have deserved such blessings, if I had withheld from
-P-A-G-E-27
j ‘TO A YOUTH 25 
my neighbours a knowledge of the means by which 
they were obtained ; and, therefore, this knowledge I 
have been in the constant habit of communicating. 
When one gives a dinner to a company, it is an ex- 
traordinary affair, and is intended, by sensible men, 
for purposes other than those of eating and drinking. 
But, in general, in the every-day life, despicable are 
those who suffer any part of their happiness to depend 
upon what they have to eat or to drink, provided 
they have a suffici of wholesome food ; despicable 
is the man, and worse than despicable the youth, that 
would make any sacrifice, however small, whether of 
money or of time, or of anything else, in order to 
secure a dinner different from that which he would 
have had without such sacrifice. Who, what man, 
ever performed a greater quantity of labour than I 
have performed? What man ever did so much? 
Now, in a great measure, I owe my capability to per- 
form this labour to my disregard of dainties. Bein, 
shut up two years in Newgate, with a fine on my h 
of a thousand pounds to the king, for having ex- 
pressed my indignation at the flogging of English- 
men under a guard of German bayonets, I ate, during 
one whole year, one mutton chop every day. Being 
once in town, with one son (then a little boy) and a 
clerk, while my family was in the country, I had dur- 
ing some weeks nothing but legs of mutton ; first 
day, leg of mutton boiled or roasted ; second, cold ; 
third, hashed ; then, leg of mutton boiled ; and so on. 
When I have been by myself, or nearly so, I have 
always proceeded thus: given directions for havi 
every day the same thing, or alternately as above, an 
every day exactly at the same hour, so as to prevent 
the necessity of any éalk about the matter. I am 
certain that, upon an average, I have not, during my 
life, spent more than thirty-five minutes a day at table,
-P-A-G-E-28

including all the meals of the day, I like, and I take 
care to have, good and clean victuals ; but, if whole- 
some and clean, that is enough. If I find it, by 
chance, too coarse for my appetite, I put the food 
aside, or let somebody do it, and leave the appetite 
to gather keenness, But the great security of all is, to 
eat Kittle, and to drink nothing that intowicates, He 
that eats till he is full is little better than a beast ; 
and he that drinks till he is drunk is quite a beast. 
81, Before I dismiss this affair of eating and drink- 
ing, let me beseech you to resolve to free yourselves 
from the slavery of ‘the tea and coffee and other slop- 
kettle, if, unhappily, you have been bred up in such 
slavery. Experience has taught me, that those slops 
axe injurious to health : until I left them off (having 
taken to them at the age of 26), even my habits of 
sobriety, moderate eating, early rising; even these 
were hot, until I left off the slops, sufficient to give 
me that complete health which I have since had. I 
pretend not to be a ‘doctor; but, I assert, that to 
pour ly, every day, a pint or two of warm liquid 
matter down the throat, whether under the name of 
tea, coffee, soup, grog, or whatever else, is greatly 
injurious to health, However, at present, what I 
have to represent to you is the great deduction, which 
the use of these slops makes, from your power of being 
useful, and also from your power to husband your 
income, whatever it may be, and from whatever source 
arising. I am to suppose you to be desirous to be- come a clever and a useful man; a man to be, if not admired and revered, at least to be respected. In order to merit respect beyond that which is due to very common men, you must do something more than very common men; and I am now going to show you panied course must be impeded by the use of the

82. If the women exclaim, ‘Nonsense! come and 
take a cup, take it for that once; but hear what 
I have to say. In answer to my representation 
regarding the waste of time which is occasioned by 
the slops, it has been said, that let what may be the 
nature of the food, there must be time for taking it. 
Not so much time, however, to eat a bit of meat or 
cheese or butter with a bit of bread. But, these 
may be eaten in a shop, a warehouse, a factory, far 
from any jire, and even in a carriage on the road. 
The slops absolutely demand fire and a congregation ; 
so that, be your business what it may ; be you shop- 
keeper, farmer, drover, sportsman, traveller, to the 
slop-board you must come; you must wait for its 
assembling, or start from home without your break- 
fast ; and, being used to the warm liquid, you feel 
out of order for the want of it. If the slops were in 
fashion amongst ploughmen and carters, we must 
all be starved for the food could never be raised. 
The mechanics are half-ruined by them. Many of 
them are become poor, enervated creatures; and 
chiefly from this cause. But is the positive cost 
nothing? At boarding-schools an additional price 
is given on account of the tea slops. Suppose you 
to be a clerk, in hired lodgings, and going to your 
counting-house at nine o’clock. You get your dinner, 
perhaps, near to the scene of your work ; but how 
are you to have the breakfast slops without a servant ? 
Perhaps you find a lodging just to suit you, but the 
house is occupied by people who keep no servants, 
and you want a servant to Aight a fire and get the 
slop ready. You could get this lodging for several 
shillings a week less than another at the next door ; 
but there they keep a servant, who will ‘get you your 
breakfast,’ and preserve you, benevolent creature as 
she-is, from the cruel necessity of going to the cup-

board and cutting off a slice of meat or cheese and 
a bit of bread. She will, most likely, toast your 
bread for you too, and melt your butter; and then 
muffle you up, in winter, and send you out almost 
swaddled. Really such a thing can hardly be ex- 
pected ever to become a man. You are weak; you 
we delicate health; you are ‘bilious!’ Why, my 
good fellow, it is these very slops that make you 
weak and bilious; And, indeed, the poverty, the real 
poverty, that they and their concomitants bring on 
you, greatly assists, in more ways than one, in pro- 
ducing your ‘delicate health. 
8. So much for indulgences in eating, drinking, 
and dress, Next, as to amusements, It is recorded 
of the famous Atrrep, that he devoted eight hours 
of the twenty-four to labour, eight to rest, and eight 
to recreation, He was, however, a king, and could 
be thinking during the eight hours of recreation. It 
is certain, that there ought to be hours of recreation, 
and I do not know that eight are too many; but, 
then observe, those hours ought to be well-chasen, 
and the sort of recreation ought to be attended to. 
It ought to be such as is at once innocent in itself 
and in its tendency, and not injurious to health. 
The sports of the field are the best of all, because 
they are conducive to health, because they are enjoyed 
by day-light, and because they demand early rising. 
The nearer that other amusements approach to these, 
the better they sre. A town-life, which many persons 
are compelled, by the nature of their calling, to lead, 
precludes the possibility of pursuing amusements of 
this description to any very considerable extent ; and 
young men in towns are, generally speaking, com- 
pelled to choose between books 2 the one hand, or ‘aming and the play-howse on the other. lancing’

spirits : it is the natural amusement of young people, 
and such it has been from the days of, Moses : it is 
enjoyed in numerous companies: it makes the parties 
to be pleased with themselves and with all about 
them ; it has no tendency to excite base and malig- 
nant feelings; and none but the most grovelling and 
hateful tyranny, or. the most stupid and despicable 
fanaticism, ever raised its voice against it. The bad 
modern habits of England have created one incon- 
venience attending the enjoyment of this healthy 
and innocent pastime, namely, late hours, which are 
at once injurious to health and destructive of order 
and of industry. In other countries people dance by 
day-light. Here they do not; and, therefore, you 
must, in this respect, submit to the custom, though 
not without robbing the dancing night of as many 
hours as you can, 
34, As to Gamine, it is always criminal, either 
in itself, or in its tendency. The basis of it is covet- 
ousness ; a desire to take from others something, for 
which you have given, and intend to give, no equiva- 
lent. No gambler was ever yet a happy man, .and 
very few gamblers. have escaped being miserable ; 
and, observe, to game for nothing is still gaming, 
and naturally leads to gaming for something. It is 
sacrificing time, and that, too, for the worst of pur- 
poses. Lhave kept house for nearly forty years ; I have 
reared a family; I have entertained as many friends 
as most people; and I have never had cards, dice, 
a chess-board, nor any implement of gaming, under 
my roof. The hours that young men spend in this 
way are hours murdered ; precious hours, that ought 
to be spent either in reading or in writing, or in rest, 
reparatory to the duties of. the dawn. Though 
do. not e with the base and nauseous flatterers, 
who now declare the army to be the best school for
-P-A-G-E-32
30 COBBETT’S ADVICE [Letter 
statesmen, it is certainly a school in which to learn 
experimentally many useful lessons; and, in this 
school I learned, that men, fond of gaming, are very 
rarely, if ever, trust-worthy. I have known many 
a clever man rejected in the way of promotion only 
because he was addicted to gaming. Men, in that 
state of life, cannot rwin themselves by gaming, for 
they possess no fortune, nor money; but the taste 
for gaming is always regarded as an indication of 
a radically bad disposition; and I can truly say, 
that I never in my whole life knew a man, fond of 
gaming, who was not, in some way or other, a person 
unworthy of confidence. This vice creeps on by 
very slow degrees, till, at last, it becomes an un- 
vernable passion, swallowing up every good and 
Kind feeling of the heart. The gambler, as pour- 
trayed by Recnarp, in a comedy the translation of 
which into English resembles the original much 
about as nearly as Sir James Granam’s plagiarisms 
resembled the Registers on which they had been 
committed, is a fine instance of the contempt and 
scorn to which gaming at last reduces its votaries ; 
but, if any young man be engaged in this fatal 
career, and be not yet wholly lost, let him behold 
Hogarru’s gambler just when he has made his last 
throw and when disappointment has bereft him of 
his senses. If after this sight he remain obdurate, 
he is doomed to be a disgrace to his name. 35. The Theatre may be a source not only of amusement but also of instruction; but, as things 
now are in this country, what, that is not bad, is to 
be learned in this school? In the first place not a word is allowed to be uttered on the stage, which 
has not been previously approved of by the Lord Chamberlain ; that is to say, by a person appointed by the Ministry, who, at his pleasure, allows, or dise
-P-A-G-E-33
Tj TO A YOUTH 31 
allows, of any piece, or any words in a piece, submitted 
to his inspection. In short, those who go to play- 
houses pay their money to hear uttered such words as 
the government approve of, and no others, It is now 
just twenty-six years since I first well und 
ow this matter was managed; and, from that 
moment to this, I have never been in an English 
play-house. Besides this, the meanness, the abject 
servility, of the players, and the slavish conduct of 
the audience, are sufficient to corrupt and debase 
the heart of any young man who is a frequent be- 
holder of them. Homage is here paid to every one 
clothed with power, be he who or what he may; 
real virtue and. public-spirit are subjects of ridicule ; 
and mock-sentiment and mock-liberality and mock- 
loyalty are applauded to the skies. 
36. ‘Show me a man’s companions, says the 
proverb, ‘and I will tell you what the man is ;” and 
this is, and must be true; because all men seek the 
society of those who think and act somewhat like 
themselves: sober men will not associate with drunk- 
ards, frugal men will not like spendthrifts, and the 
orderly and decent shun the noisy, the disorderly, 
and the debauched. It is for the very vulgar to 
herd together as singers, ringers, and smokers; but, 
there is a class rather higher still more blamable ; 
I mean the tavern-haunters, the gay companions, 
who herd together to do little but talk, and who are 
so fond of talk that they go from home to get at it. 
The conversation amongst such persons has nothing 
of instruction in it, and is generally of a vicious 
tendency. Young people naturally and commendably 
seek the society of those of their own age; but, be 
careful in choosing your companions; and lay this 
down as a rule never to be de from, that no 
youth, nor man, ought to be called your friend, who

is addicted to indecent talk, or whois fond of the 
society of prostitutes. Wither of these argues a de- 
praved taste, and even a depraved heart ; an absence 
of all principle and of all trust-worthiness; and, 
& have remarked it all my life long, that young men, 
addicted to these vices, never succeed in the end, 
whatever advantages they may have, whether. in 
fortune or in talent. Fond mothers and fathers are 
but too apt to be over-lenient to such offenders ; 
and, as long as youth lasts and fortune smiles, the 
punishment is deferred; but, it comes.at last; it is 
sure to come; and the gay and dissolute youth is 
a dejected and miserable man, After the early part 
of a life spent in illicit indulgences, a man is un- 
worthy of Being the husband of a virtuous woman ; 
and, if he have anything like justice in him, how is 
he to-reprove, in his children, vices in which he 
himself so long indulged? These vices of youth are 
varnished over by the saying, that there must. be time for ‘sowing the wild oats, and that ‘ wildest 
colts make the best horses’ These figurative oats 
are, however, generally like the literal ones; they 
are never to be eradicated from the soil; and as to 
the colts, wildness in them is an indication of high 
animal spirit, having nothing at all to do with the 
mind, which is invariably debilitated and debased by 
profligate indulgences. Yet this miserable piece of 
sophistry, the offspring of parental weakness, is in 
constant use, to the inealeulable injury of the rising generation. What so amiable as a steady, trust- worthy boy? He is of real use at an early age: he can be trusted far out of the sight of parent or employer, while the ‘ pickle,’ as the poor fond parents the profligate, is a great deal worse than useless, because there must be some one to.see that he does no harm. If you have to choose, choose companions

of your own rank in life as nearly as may be; but, 
at any rate, none to whom you acknowledge in- 
Seriority ; for, slavery is too soon learned ; and, if the 
mind be bowed down in the youth, it will seldom 
rise up in the man. In the schools of those best of 
teachers the Jesurrs, there is perfect equality as to 
rank in life: the boy, who enters there, leaves all 
family pride behind him: intrinsic merit alone is the 
standard of preference; and the masters are so 
scrupulous upon this head, that they do not suffer 
one scholar, of whatever rank, to have more money 
to spend than the poorest. These wise men know 
well the mischiefs that must arise from inequality of 
pecuniary means amongst their scholars: they know 
how injurious it would be to learning, if deference 
were, by the learned, paid to the dunce; and they, 
therefore, take the most effectual means to prevent 
it. Hence, amongst other causes, it is, that their 
scholars have, ever since the existence of their Order, 
been the most celebrated for learning of any men in 
the world. 
37. In your manners be neither boorish nor blunt, 
but even these are preferable to simpering and crawl- 
ing. I wish every English youth could see those of 
the United States of America; always civil, never 
servile, Be obedient, where obedience is due; for, it 
is no act of meanness, and no indication of want of 
spirit, to yield implicit and ready obedience to those 
who have a right to demand it at your hands. In 
this respect England has been, and I hope always 
will be, an example to the whole world. To this 
habit of willing and prompt obedience in apprentices, 
in servants, in all inferiors in station, she owes, in 
a great measure, her multitudes of matchless mer- 
chants, tradesmen, and workmen of every description, 
and.also the achievements of her armies and iavies.

It is no disgrace, but the contrary, to obey, cheer- 
fully, lawful and just commands. None.are so saucy 
and disobedient as slaves; and, when you come to 
read history, you will find that in proportion as 
nations have been free has been their reverence for 
the laws. But, there is a wide difference between 
lawful and cheerful obedience and that servility which 
represents people as laying petitions ‘at the King's 
Jeet; which makes us imagine that we behold the 
supplicants actually crawling upon their bellies. 
There is something so abject in this expression ; 
there is such horrible self-abasement in it, that I do 
hope that every youth, who shall read this, will hold 
in detestation the reptiles who make use of it. In 
all other countries, the lowest individual can put 
a petition into the hands of the chief magistrate, be 
he king or emperor: let us hope, that the time will 
yet come when Englishmen will be able to do the 
same. In. the meanwhile I beg you to despise these 
worse than pagan parasites, 
88, Hitherto I have addressed you chiefly relative 
to the things to be avoided: let me now turn 
to the things which you ought to do. And, first 
of all, the husbanding of your time. The respect 
that you will receive, the real and sincere respect, 
will depend entirely on what you are able to do. 
If you be rich, you may purchase what is called 
respect; but it is not worth having. To obtain 
respect worth possessing, you must, as I observed 
fore, do more than the common run of men in 
your state of life; and, to be enabled to do this, 
you must manage well your time: and, to manage 
it well, you must have as much of the day-light 
and as little of the candle-light as is consistent with 
the due discharge of your duties. When people get 
into the habit of sitting up merely for the purpose
-P-A-G-E-37
q] TO A YOUTH 85 
of talking, it is no easy matter to break themselves 
of it: and if they do not go to bed early, they 
cannot rise early. Young people require more sleep 
than those that are grown up: there must be the 
number of hours, and that number cannot well be, 
on an average, less than eight: and, if it be more 
in winter time, it is all the better; for, an hour in 
bed is better than an hour spent over fire and candle 
in an idle gossip. People never should sit talking 
till they do not know what to talk about. It is 
said by the country-people, that one hour’s slee 
before midnight is worth more than two are worth 
after midnight, and this I believe to be a fact; but 
it is useless to go to bed early and even to rise early, 
if the time be not well employed after rising. In 
eral, half the morning is loitered away, the party 
ing in a sort of half-dressed. half-naked state ; out 
of bed, indeed, but still in a sort of bedding. Those 
who first invented morning-gowns and slippers could 
have very little else to do. These things are very | 
suitable to those who have had fortunes gained for 
them by others; very suitable to those who have 
nothing to do, and who merely live for the purpose 
of assisting to consume the produce of the earth ; 
but he who has his bread to earn, or who means to 
be worthy of respect on account of his labours, has 
no business with morning gown and slippers. In 
short, be your business or calling what it may, dress 
at once for the day 5 and learn to do it as quickly as 
possible. A looking-glass is a piece of furniture 
a great deal worse than useless. Looking at the face 
will not alter its shape or its colour; and, perhaps, 
of all wasted time, none is so foolishly wasted as 
that which is employed in surveying one’s own face. 
Nothing can be of little importance, if one be com- 
pelled to attend to it every day of our lives ; if we

shaved but once a year, er once a month, the execu- 
tion of the thing would be hardly worth naming: 
but this is a piece of work that must be done once 
every day; and, as it may cost only about five 
minutes of time, and may be, and frequently is, made 
to cost thirty, or even fifty minutes; and, as only 
fifteen minutes make about a. fifty-eighth part of the 
hours of our average daylight; this being the case, 
this is a matter of real importance. I once heard 
Siz Jonn Srvctarr ask Mr. Cocnrane JOHNSTONE, 
whether he meaned to have a son of his (then a little 
boy) taught Latin. ‘No,’ said Mr. Jounstows, ‘but 
I mean to do something a great deal better for him.’ 
‘What is that?’ said Sir John. ‘Why,’ said the 
other, ‘teach him to shave with cold water and with- 
out a glass” Which, I dare say, he did; and for 
which benefit I am sure that son has had good 
reason to be grateful. Only think of the incon- 
venience attending the common practice! There 
must be hot water; to have this there must be a jire, 
and; in some cases, a fire for that purpose alone; to 
have these, there must be a servant, or you must light 
a fire yourself. For the want of these, the job is put 
off until a later hour: this causes a stripping and 
another dressing bout; or, you go in a slovenly state 
all that day, and the next day the thing must be 
done, or cleanliness must be abandoned altogether. 
If you be on a journey you must wait the pleasure of 
the servants at the inn before-you can dress and set 
out in the morning ; the pleasant time for travelling 
is gone before you can move from the spot; instead 
of being at the end of your day’s journey in good 
time, you are benighted, and have to endure all the 
t inconveniences attendant on tardy movements. 
And, all this, from the appareritly insignificant affair 
of shaving! How many a piece of important busi-
-P-A-G-E-39
Yj TO A YOUTH 37 
ness has failed from a short delay! And how many 
thousand of such delays daily proceed from this un- 
worthy cause! ‘ Toujours prét’ was the motto of 
a famous French general; and pray let it be yours: 
be ‘always ready; and never, during your whole 
life, have to say, ‘I cannot go till I be shaved and 
dressed? Do the whole at once for the day, what- 
ever may be your state of life; and then you have 
a day unbroken by those indispensable performances. 
Begin thus, in the days of your youth, and, having 
felt the superiority which this practice will give you 
over those in all other respects your equals, the 
practice will stick by you to the end of your life. 
Till you be shaved and dressed for the day, you 
cannot set steadily about any business; you know 
that you must presently quit your labour to return 
to the dressing affair; you, therefore, put it off until 
that be over; the interval, the precious interval, is 
spent in lounging about; and, by the time that 
you are ready for business, the best part of the day 
is gone. 
39. Trifling as this matter appears upon naming 
it, it is, in fact, one of the great concerns of life ; 
and, for my part, I can truly say, that I owe 
more of my great labours to my strict adherence to 
the precepts that I have here given you, than to all 
the natural abilities with which I have been en- 
dowed; for these, whatever may have been their 
amount, would have been of comparatively little use, 
even aided by great sobriety and abstinence, if I had 
not, in early life, contracted the blessed habit of 
husbanding well my time. To this, more than to 
any other thing, 1 owed my very extraordinary 
promotion in the army. I was always ready: if 
I had to mount guard at ten, I was ready at nine: 
never did any man, or any thing, wait one moment

for me. Being, at an age wnder twenty years, raised 
from Corporal to Serjeant Major at once, over the 
heads of thirty serjeants, I naturally’ should have 
been an object of envy and hatred; but this habit 
of early rising and of rigid adherence to the precepts 
which I have given you, really subdued these passions; 
because every one felt, that what I did he had never 
done, and never could do. Before my promotion, 
a clerk was wanted to make out the morning report 
of the regiment. I rendered the clerk unnecessary ¢ 
and, long before any other man was dressed for the 
parade, my work for the morning was all done, and 
I myself was on the parade, walking, in fine weather, 
for an hour perhaps. My custom was this: to get 
up, in summer, at day-light, and in winter at four 
o'clock; shave, dress, even to the putting of my 
sword-belt over my shoulder, and having my sword 
lying on the table before me, ready to hang by m 
side. Then I ate a bit of cheese, or pork, and bread. 
Then I prepared my report, which was filled up as 
fast as the companies brought me in the materials. 
After this I an hour or two to read, before the 
time came for any duty out of doors, unless when 
the regiment or part of it went out to exercise in 
the morning. When this was the case, and the 
matter was left to me, I always had it on the ground 
in such time as that the bayonets glistened in the 
rising sun, a, sight which gave me delight, of which 
I often think, but which I should in vain endeavour 
to describe. If the officers were to go out, eight or 
ten o'clock was the hour, sweating the men in the 
heat of the day, breaking in upon the time for cooking their dinner, putting all things out of order and all men out of hamour. When I was commander, 
the'men had a long day of leisure before them: they could ramble into the town or into the woods; go
-P-A-G-E-41
qj TO A YOUTH 39 
to get raspberries, to catch birds, to catch fish, or 
to Pursue any other recreation, and such of them 
as chose, and were qualified, to work at their trades. 
So that here, arising solely from the early habits 
of one very young man, were pleasant and happy 
days given to hundreds. 
40. Money is said to be power, which is, in some 
cases, true; and the same may be said of knowledge ; 
but superior sobriety, industry and activity, are a 
still more certain source of power ; for without these, 
knowledge is of little use; and, as to the power 
which money gives, it is that of brute force, it is the 
ower of the bludgeon and the bayonet, and of the 
ribed press, tongue and pen. Superior sobriety, 
industry, activity, though accompanied with but 
a moderate portion of knowledge, command respect, 
because they have great and visible influence. The 
drunken, the lazy, and the inert, stand abashed 
before the sober and the active. Besides, all those 
whose interests are at stake prefer, of necessity, 
those whose exertions produce the greatest and most 
immediate and visible effect. Self-interest is no 
respecter of persons: it asks, not who knows best 
what ought to be done, but who is most likely to 
do it: we may, and often do, admire the talents 
of lazy, and even dissipated men, but we do not 
trust them with the care of our interests. If, there- 
fore, you would have respect and influence in the 
circle in which you move, be more sober, more in- 
dustrious, more active than the general run of those 
amongst whom you live. 
41, As to Epucation, this word is now applied 
exclusively to things which are taught in schools; 
but education means rearing up, and the French 
speak of the education of pigs and sheep. In a very 
famous French book on rural affairs, there is a
-P-A-G-E-42
40 COBBETT’S ADVICE [Letter 
Chapter entitled ‘Education du Cochon;’ that is, 
education of the hog. The word has the same 
meaning in both languages; for both take it from 
the Latin. Neither is the word LeaRNninc properly 
confined to things taught in schools, or by books; 
for, earning means Knowledge s and, but a compara- 
tively small part of useful knowledge comes from 
books. Men are not to be called ignorant merely 
because they cannot make upon paper certain marks 
with a pen, or because they do not Enow the meaning 
of such marks when made by others. A ploughman 
may be very earned in his line, though he does not 
know what the letters p. 1. 0. u. g. h mean when he 
sees them combined upon paper. The first thin, 
to be required of a man is, that he understand well 
his own calling, or profession; and, be you in what 
state of life you may, to acquire this knowledge 
ought to be your first and greatest care. A man 
who has had a new-built house tumble down will 
derive little more consolation from being told that 
the architect is a great astronomer, than this dis- 
tressed nation now derives from being assured that 
its distresses arise from the measures of a long list 
of the greatest orators and greatest heroes that the 
world ever beheld. 
42, Nevertheless, book-learning is by no means 
to be despised; and it is a thing which may be 
laudably sought after by persons in all states of life 
In those pursuits which are called professions, it is 
necessary, and also in certain trades; and, in persons 
in the middle ranks of life, a total absence of such 
learning is somewhat disgraceful, There is, however, 
one danger to be carefully guarded against; namely, 
the opinion that your genius, or your literary acquire- 
ments, are such as to warrant iz in disregarding 
the calling in which you are, and by which you gain
-P-A-G-E-43
1] TO A YOUTH 41 
your bread. Parents must have an uncommon portion 
of solid sense to counterbalance their natural affection 
sufficiently to make them competent judges in such a 
case. Friends are partial; and those who are not, 
you deem enemies. Stick, therefore, to the shop; 
rely upon your mercantile or mechanical or pro- 
fessional calling; try your strength in literature, 
if you like; but, rely on the shop. If Bioomrrexp, 
who wrote a poem called the Farmer’s Boy, had placed 
no reliance on the faithless muses, his unfortunate and 
much-to-be-pitied family would, in all probability, 
have not been in a state to solicit relief from charity. 
I remember that this loyal shoemaker was flattered 
to the skies, and (ominous sign, if he had understood 
it) feasted at the tables of some of the great. Have, 
I beseech you, no hope of this sort; and, if you 
find it creeping towards your heart, drive it instantly 
away as the mortal foe of your independence and 
your peace, 
43. With this precaution, however, book-learnin, 
is not only proper, but highly commendable ; and 
portions of it are absolutely necessary in every case 
of trade or profession. One of these portions is dis- 
tinct reading, plain and neat writing, and arithmetic. 
'The two former are mere child’s work ; the latter not 
quite so easily acquired, but equally indispensable, and 
of it you ought to have a thorough knowledge before 
‘ou attempt to study even the grammar of your own 
mguage. Arithmetic is soon learned ; it is not a 
thing that requires much natural talent; it is not 
a thing that loads the memory or puzzles the mind ; 
and it is a thing of every-day utility. Therefore, this 
is, to a certain extent, an absolute necessary ; an in- - 
dispensable acquisition, Every man is not to bea 
surveyor or an actuary ; and, therefore, you may stop 
far short of the knowledge, of this sort, which is

42, COBBETT’S ADVICE [Letter 
demanded by these professions ; but, as far as common 
accounts and calculations go, you ought to be perfect ; 
and this you may make yourself, without any assist- 
ance from a master, by bestowing upon this science, 
during six months, only one half of the time that is, 
by persons of your age, usually wasted over the tea- 
slops, or other kettle-slops, alone! If you become 
fond of this science, there may be a little danger of 
wasting your time on it. When, therefore, you have 
got as much of it as your business or profession can 
possibly render necessary, turn the time to some other 
purpose. As to books, on this subject, they are in 
everybody’s hand ; but, there is one book on the sub- 
ject of calculations, which I must point out to you; 
‘Tue Camaist, by Dr. Keniry. This is a bad title, 
because, to men in general, it gives no idea of what 
the book treats of. It is a book which shows the 
value of the several pieces of money of one country 
when stated in the money of another country. For 
instance, it tells us what a Spanish Dollar, a Dutch 
Dollar, a French Frank, and so on, is worth in English 
money. It does the same with regard to weights and 
measures : and it extends its information to all the 
countries im the world, It is a work of rare merit ; 
and every youth, be his state of life what it may, if 
it permit him to sue book-learning of any sort, 
and icularly if he be destined, or at all likely to 
meddle with commercial matters, ought, as soon as 
convenient, to possess this valuable and instructive 
ok, 
44. The next thing is the Grammar of your own 
language. Without understanding this, you can never hope to become fit for anything beyond mere trade or agriculture. It is true, that we do (God 
knows !) but too often see men have great wealth, 
high titles, and boundless power heaped upon them,
-P-A-G-E-45
1] To A YOUTH 43 
who can hardly write ten lines together correctly ; 
but, remember, it is not merit that has been the cause 
of their advancement ; the cause has been, in almost 
every such case, the subserviency of the party to the 
will of some government, and the baseness of some 
nation who have quietly submitted to be governed 
by brazen fools. Do not you imagine, that you will 
have luck of this sort : do not you hope to be re- 
warded and honoured for that ignorance which shall 
prove a scourge to your country, and which will earn 
you the curses of the children yet unborn. Rely you 
upon your merit, and upon nothing else. Without a 
knowledge of grammar, it is impossible for you to 
write correctly, and it is by mere accident if you 
speak correctly ; and, pray bear in mind, that all well- 
informed persons judge of a man’s mind (until they 
have other means of judging) by his writing or 
speaking. The labour necessary to acquire this 
knowledge is, indeed, not trifling: grammar is not, 
like arithmetic, a science consisting of several distinct 
departments, some of which may be dispensed with : 
it is a whole, and the whole must be learned, or no 
part is learned. The subject is abstruse: it demands 
much reflection and much patience: but, when once 
the task is performed, it is performed for life, and in 
every day of that life it will be found to be, in a 
greater or less degree, a source of pleasure or of profit 
or of both together, And, what is the labour? It 
consists of no bodily exertion ; it exposes the student 
to no cold, no hunger, no suffering of any sort. The 
study need subtract from the hours of no business, 
nor, indeed, from the hours of necessary exercise : 
the hours usually spent on the tea and coffee slops 
and in the mere gossip which accompany them ; those 
wasted hours of only one year, employed in the study 
of English grammar, would make you a correct speaker
-P-A-G-E-46
44 COBBETT’S ADVICE {Letter 
and writer for the rest of your life. You want no 
school, no room to study in, no expenses, and no 
troublesome circumstances of any sort. I learned 
grammar when I was a private soldier on the pay of 
sixpence a day. The edge of my berth, or that 
of the guard-bed, was my seat to study in; my 
knapsack was my book-case ; a bit of board, lying on 
my lap, was my writing-table ; and the task did not 
demand any thing like a year of my life. I had no 
money to purchase candle or oil ; in winter-time it 
was rarely that I could get any evening-light but 
that of the fire, and only my turn even of that. And 
if J, under such circumstances, and without parent or 
friend to advise or encourage me, accomplished this 
undertaking, what excuse can there be for any youth, 
however poor, however pressed with business, or how- 
ever circumstanced as to room or other conveniences ? 
To buy a pen or a sheet of paper I was compelled to 
forego some portion of food, though in a state of 
half-starvation; I had no moment of time that I 
could call my own; and I had to read and to write 
amidst. the talking, laughing, singing, whistling and 
brawling of at least half a score of the most thought- 
less of men, and that too in the hours of their free- 
dom from all control. Think not lightly of the 
farthing that I had to give, now and then, for ink, 
pen, or paper! That farthing was, alas! a great sum 
to me! I was as tall as I am now; I had great 
health and great exercise. The whole of the money, 
not expended for us at market, was two-pence a week 
for each man, I remember, and well I may! that 
upon one occasion I, after all absolutely necessary 
expenses, had, on a Friday, made shift to have a half- 
penny in reserve, which 1 had destined for the pur- 
chase of a red-herring in the morning; but, when I 
pulled off my clothes at night, so hungry then as to
-P-A-G-E-47
1] TO A YOUTH 45 
be hardly able to endure life, I found that I had lost 
my halfpenny! 1 buried my head under the miser- 
able sheet and rug, and cried like a child! And, 
again I say, if I, under circumstances like these, could 
encounter and overcome this task, is there, can there 
be, in the whole world, a youth to find an excuse for 
the non-performance ? What youth, who shall read 
this, will not be ashamed to say, that he is not able 
to find time and opportunity for this most essential 
of all the branches of book-learning ? 
45, I press this matter with such earnestness, 
because a knowledge of grammar is the foundation 
of all literature ; and because without this knowledge 
opportunities for writing and speaking are only occa- 
sions for men to display their unfitness to write and 
speak, How many false pretenders to erudition 
have I exposed to shame merely by my knowledge 
of grammar! How many of the insolent and igno- 
rant great and powerful have I pulled down and 
made little and despicable! And, with what ease 
have I conveyed upon numerous important subjects, 
information and instruction to millions now alive, 
and provided a store of both for millions yet unborn ! 
As to the course to be pursued in this tt under- 
taking, it is, first, to read the grammar from the first 
word to the last, very attentively, several times over ; 
then, to copy the whole of it very correctly and 
neatly ; and then to study the Chapters one by one. 
And what do this reading and writing require as to 
time? Both together not more than the tea-slops 
and their gossips for three months! There are about 
three hun pages in my English Grammar. Four 
of those little pages in a day, which is a mere trifle 
of work, do the thing in three months, ‘Two hours 
a day are quite sufficient for the purpose; and these 
may, in any town that I have ever known, or in any
-P-A-G-E-48
46 COBBETT’S ADVICE {Letter 
village, be taken from that part of the mornin, 
during which the main part of the people are in bed. 
I do not like the evening-candle-light work : it wears 
the eyes much more than the same sort of light in 
the morning, because then the faculties are in vigour 
and wholly unexhausted. But for this purpose 
there is sufficient of that day-light which is usually 
wasted ; usually gossipped or founged away ; or spent 
in some other manner productive of no pleasure, and 
enerally producing pain in the end. It is very 
Becoming in all persons, and particularly in the 
young, to be civil, and even polite: but it becomes 
neither young nor old to have an everlasting simper 
on their faces, and their bodies sawing in an ever- 
lasting bow: and, how many youths have I seen who, 
if they had spent, in the learning of grammar, a 
tenth part of the time that they have consumed in 
earning merited contempt for their affected gentility, 
would have laid the foundation of sincere respect to- 
wards them for the whole of their lives! 
46. Perseverance is a prime quality in every pur- 
suit, and particularly in this. Yours is, too, the 
time of life to acquire this inestimable habit. Men 
fail much oftener from want of perseverance than from 
want of talent and of good disposition : as the race 
was not to the hare but to the tortoise, so the meed 
of success in study is to him who is not in haste, but 
to him who proceeds with a steady and even step. It is-not to a want of taste or of desire or of dis- position to learn that we have to ascribe the rare- ness of good*scholars, so much as to the want. of tient perseverance. Grammar is a branch of know- edge 5 ike all other things of high value, it is of difficult acquirement : the study is dry; the subject is intricate; it engages not the passions; and, if the great end be not kept constantly in view ; if you
-P-A-G-E-49
Tj TO A YOUTH 47 
lose, for a moment, sight of the ample reward, in- 
difference begins, that is followed by weariness, and 
disgust and despair close the book. To guard against 
this result be not in haste; keep steadily on; and, 
when you find weariness approaching, rouse yourself, 
and remember, that if you give up, all that you have 
done has been done in vain. This is a matter of 
great moment ; for out of every ten, who undertake 
this task, there are, perhaps, nine who abandon it in 
despair ; and this, too, merely for the want of reso- 
lution to overcome the first approaches of weariness. 
The most effectual means of security against this 
mortifying result is to lay down a rule to write or to 
read a certain fixed quantity every day, Sunday ex- 
cepted. Our minds are not always in the same 
state; they have not, at all times, the same elasticity ; 
to-day we are full of hope on the very same grounds ~ 
which, to-morrow, afford us no hope at all: every 
human being is liable to those flows and ebbs of the 
mind ; but, if reason interfere, and bid you overcome 
the fits of lassitude, and almost mechanically to go 
on without the stimulus of hope, the buoyant fit 
speedily returns; you congratulate yourself that you 
did not yield to the temptation to abandon your 
ursuit, and you proceed with more vigour than ever. 
Five or six triumphs over temptation to indolence 
or despair lay the foundation of certain success ; 
and, what is of still more importance, fix in you the 
habit of perseverance. . 
47. If I have bestowed a large portion of mys 
on this topic, it has been because I know, from 
experience as well as from observation, that it is of 
more importance than all the other branches of book- 
learning put together. It gives you, when you possess 
it thoroughly, a real and practical superiority over 
the far greater part of men. How often did I ex- -

perience this even long before I became what is called 
an author! The Adjutant, under whom it was my 
duty to act when I was a Serjeant Major, was, as 
almost all military officers are, or at least were, 
a very illiterate man, perceiving that every sentence 
of mine was in the same form and manner as sen- 
tences in print, became shy of letting me see pieces 
of his writing. The writing of orders, and other 
things, therefore, fell to me; and thus, though no 
nominal addition was made to my pay, and no nominal 
addition to my authority, I acquired the latter as 
effectually as if a law had been passed to confer it 
upon me. In short, I owe to the possession of this 
branch of knowledge everything that has enabled me 
to do so many things that very few other men have 
done, and that now gives me a degree of influence, 
such as is possessed by few others, in the most weighty 
concerns of the country, The possession of this 
branch of knowledge raises you in your own esteem, 
gives just confidence in yourself, and prevents you 
from being the willing slave of the rich and the 
titled part of the community. It enables you to 
discover that riches and titles do not confer merit ; 
you think comparatively little of them; and, as far 
as relates to you, at any rate, their insolence is 
innoxious, 
. 48. Hoping that I have said enough to induce you 
to set resolutely about the study of grammar, I 
might here leave the subject of earning ; arithmetic 
and mmar, both well learned, being as much as I 
could wish in a mere youth, But these need not 
occupy the whole of your spare time ; and, there are 
other branches of learning which ought immediately 
to follow. If your own calling or profession require 
book-study, books treating of that are to be preferred 
to all others; for, the first thing, the first object in
-P-A-G-E-51
T] TO A YOUTH 49 
life, is to secure the honest means of obtaining sus- 
tenance, raiment, and a state of being suitable to 
your rank, be that rank what it may: excellence in 
your own calling is, therefore, the first thing to be 
aimed at. After this may come general knowledge, 
and of this, the first is a thorough knowledge of 
your own country ; for, how ridiculous is it to see an 
English youth engaged in reading about the customs 
of the Chinese or ae the Hindoos, while he is content 
to be totally ignorant of those of Kent or of Corn- 
wall ! Well employed he must be in ascertaining 
how Greece was divided and how the Romans par- 
celled out their territory, while he knows not, and 
apparently does not want to know, how England 
came to be divided into counties, hundreds, parishes 
and tithings. 
49, Gzocraruy naturally follows Grammar; and 
you should begin with that of this kingdom, which 
you ought to understand well, perfectly well, before 
ou venture to look abroad. A rather slight know- 
ledge of the divisions and customs of other countries 
is, generally speaking, sufficient ; but, not to know 
these full well, as far as relates to our own country, 
is, in one who pretends to be a gentleman or a 
scholar, somewhat disgraceful. Yet how many men 
are there, and those called gentlemen too, who seem 
to think that counties and parishes, and churches and 
parsons, and tithes and glebes, and manors and courts- 
leet, and paupers and poor-houses, all grew up in 
England, or dropped down upon it, immediately after 
Noah's flood! Surely, it is necessary for every man, 
having any pretensions to scholarship, to know how 
these things came ; and, the sooner this knowledge is 
acquired the better; for, until it be acquired, you 
read the history of your country in vain. Indeed, to 
communicate this knowledge is one main part of the

business of history; but it is a part which no his- 
torian, commonly so called, has, that I know of, 
ever yet performed, except, in part, myself, in the 
History of the Proresranr Rerormation. I had 
read Hume’s History of England, and the Continua- 
tion by Smouzerr; but, in 1802, when I wanted to 
write on the subject of the non-residence of the clergy, 
I found, to my great mortification, that I knew 
nothing of the foundation of the office and the claims 
of the parsons, and that I could not even guess at the 
origin of parishes, This gave a new turn to my 
inquiries; and I soon found the romancers, called 
historians, had given me no information that I could 
rely on, and, besides, had done, apparently, all they 
could to keep me in the dark. 
50. When you come to Hisrory, begin also with 
that of your own country ; and here it is my bounden 
duty to put you well on your guard; for in this 
Patel we are peculiarly unfortunate, and for the 
following reasons, to which I beg you to attend. 
Three hundred years ago, the religion of England 
had been, during nine hundred years, the Catholic 
religion: the Catholic clergy possessed about a third 
part of all the lands and houses, which they held in 
trust for their own support, for the building and re- 
pairing of churches, and for the relief of the poor, 
the widow, the orphan, and the stranger ; but, at the 
time just mentioned, the king and the aristocracy 
changed the religion to Protestant, took the estates 
of the church an the poor fo themselves as their own 
property, and taxed the people at large for the build- 
ing and repairing of clarches and Or the relief of 
the poor. This great and terrible change, effected 
partly by force against the people and partly by the 
most artful means of deception, gave rise to a series 
of efforts, which has been continued from that day to
-P-A-G-E-53
I] TO A YOUTH 51 
this, to cause us all to believe, that that change was 
for the beiter, that it was for our good; and that, 
before that time, our forefathers were a set of the 
most miserable slaves that the sun ever warmed with 
his beams. It happened, too, that the art of printi 
was not discovered, or, at least, it was very little 
understood, until about the time when this change 
took place; so that the books relating to former 
times were confined to manuscript ; and, besides, even 
these manuscript libraries were destroyed with great 
care by those who had made the change and had 
grasped the property of the poor and the church. 
Our ‘ Historians, as they are called, have written 
under fear of the powerful, or have been bribed by 
them; and, generally speaking, both at the same 
time; and, accordingly, their works are, as far as 
they relate to former times, masses of lies unmatched 
by any others that the world has ever seen. 
51. The great object of these lies always has been 
to make the main body of the people believe, that the 
nation is now more happy, more populous, more 
powerful, than it was before it was Protestant, and 
thereby to induce us to conclude, that it was a good 
thing for us that the aristocracy should take to them- 
selves the property of the poor and the church, and 
make the people at large pay taxes for the su; of 
both. This has been, ad: still is, the great object of 
all those heaps of lies ; and those lies are continually 
spread about amongst us in all forms of publication, 
from heavy folios down to half-penny tracts. In re- 
futation of those lies we have only very few and rare 
ancient books to refer to, and their information is 
incidental, seeing that their authors never dreamed 
of the possibility of the lying generations which were 
to come, We have the ancient acts of parliament, 
the common-law, the customs, the canons of the

church, and the churches themselves; but these de- 
mand analyses and argument, and they demand also 
a really free press, and unprejudiced and patient 
readers. Never in this world, before, had truth to 
struggle with so many and such great disadvantages ! 
52. To refute lies is not, at present, my business ; 
but it is my business to give you, in as small a com- 
pass as possible, one striking proof that they are lies ; 
and thereby to put you well upon your guard for the 
whole of the rest of your life. The opinion sedu- 
lously inculcated by these ‘historians’ is this; that, 
before the Protestant times came, England was, com- 
atively, an insignificant country, having few people 
ere and Those foro wretchedly poor and miserable, Now, 
take the following wndeniable facts. All the parishes 
in England are now (except where they have been 
united, and two, three; or four, have been made into 
one) in point of size, what they were a thousand years 
. The county of Norfolk is the best cultivated 
of any one in England. This county has now 731 
parishes; and the number was formerly greater. 
Of these parishes 22 have now no churches at all ; 
4 contain less than 100 souls each: and 268 have 
no parsonage-houses. Now, observe, every parish had, 
in old times, a church and a parsonage-house. The 
county contains 2,092 square miles; that is to say, 
something less than 3 square miles to each parish, 
and that is 1,920 statute acres of land; and the size 
of each parish is, on an average, that of a piece of 
ground. about one mile and a half each way ; so that 
the churches are, even now, on an average, only 
about a mile and a half from each other. Now, the 
uestions for you to put to yourself are these : Were 
churches formerly built and kept up without being 
wanted, and especially by a poor'and miserable people ? Did these miserable people build 74 churches out of
-P-A-G-E-55
q] TO A YOUTH 53 
781, each of which 74 had not a hundred souls be- 
longing to it? Is it a sign of an augmented popula- 
tion, that 22 churches out of 731 have tumbled down 
and been effaced? Was it a country thinly inhabited 
by miserable people that could build and keep a 
church in every piece of ground a mile and a half 
each way, besides having, in this same county, 77 
monastic establishments and 142 free chapels? Is it 
a sign of augmented population, ease and plenty, 
that, out of 71 parishes, 268 have suffered the 
parsonage houses to fall into ruins, and their sites to 
become patches of nettles and of brambles? Put 
these questions calmly to yourself: common sense 
will dictate the answers; and truth will call for an 
expression of your indignation against the lying 
historians and the still more lying population- 
mongers,

LETTER II 
TO A YOUNG MAN 
58. In the foregoing Letter, I have given my 
advice to a Youth. In addressing myself to you, 
Iam to presume that you have entered upon your 
present stage of life, having acted upon the precepts 
contained in that letter; and that, of course, you 
are a sober, abstinent, industrious and well-informed 
oung man. In the succeeding letters, which will 
addressed to the Lover, the Husband, the Father 
and the Citizen, I shall, of course, have to include my 
notion of your duties as a master, and as a person 
employed by another. In the present letter, there- 
fore, I shall confine myself principally to the con- 
duct of a young man with regard to the management 
of his means, or money. 
54, Be you in what line of life you may, it. will 
be amongst your misfortunes if you have not time 
properly to attend to this matter; for it very fre- 
quently happens, it has happened to thousands upon 
thousands, not only to be ruined, according to the 
common acceptation of the word; not only to be 
made poor, and to suffer from poverty, in consequence 
* of want of attention to pecuni matters; but it 
has frequently, and even generally, happened, that 
a want of attention to these matters has impeded 
the progress of science, and of genius itself, A man; 
oppressed with pecuniary cares and dangers, must be 
next to a miracle, if he have his mind jn a state fit 
ee
-P-A-G-E-57
TO A YOUNG MAN 55 
for intellectual labours ; to say nothing of the tempta- 
tions, arising from such distress, to abandon good 
rinciples, to suppress useful opinions and useful 
‘acts; and, in short, to become a disgrace to his 
kindred, and an evil to his country, instead of being 
an honour to the former and a blessing to the latter. 
To be poor and independent, is very nearly an im- 
possibility. 
55. But, then, poverty is not a positive, but a 
relative term. Burke observed, and very truly, that 
a labourer who earned a sufficiency to maintain him 
as a labourer, and to maintain him in a suitable 
manner; to give him a sufficiency of good food, of 
clothing, of lodging, and of fuel, ought not to be 
called a poor man; for that, though he had little 
riches, though his, compared with that of a lord, was 
a state of poverty, it was not a state of poverty in 
itself. When, therefore, I say that poverty is the 
cause of a depression of spirit, of inactivity and of 
servility in men of literary talent, I must say, at the 
same time, that the evil arises from their own fault ; 
from their having created for themselves imaginary 
wants; from their having indulged in unnecessary 
enjoyments, and from their having caused that to be 
poverty, which would not have been poverty, if they 
had been moderate in their enjoyments. 
56. As it may be your lot (such has been mine) 
to live by your literary talent, I will here, before 
I proceed to matter more applicable to persons in 
other states of life, observe, that I cannot form an 
idea of 4 mortal more wretched than a man of real. 
talent, compelled to curb his genius, and to submit 
himself in the exercise of that genius, to those whom 
“he knows to be far inferior to himself, and whom he 
must despise from the bottom of his soul. The late

maker at Asnsurton in Devonshire; who was put 
to school and sent to the university at the expense 
of a generous and good clergyman of the name 
of Cooxson, and who died, the other day, a sort of 
whipper-in of Murray’s Quarrerty Review; this 
was a man of real genius; and, to my certain personal 
- knowledge, he detested, from the bottom of his soul, 
the whole of the paper-money and Boroughmongering 
system, and despised those by whom the system was 
carried on. But, he had imaginary wants; he had 
been bred up in company with the rich and the 
extravagant ; expensive indulgences had been made 
necessary to him by habit; and, when in the year 
1798, .or thereabouts, he had to choose between 
a bit of bacon, a scrag of mutton, and a lodging at 
ten shillings a week, on the one side, and made-dishes, 
wine, a fine house and a footman on the other side, 
he chose the latter. He became the servile Editor 
of Cannine’s Anti-jacobin newspaper; and he, who 
had more wit and learning than all the rest of the 
writers put together, became the miserable tool in 
circulating their attacks upon everything that was 
hostile to a system which he deplored and detested. 
But he secured the made-dishes, the wine, the foot- 
man and the coachman. A sinecure as ‘clerk of the 
Foreign Estreats, gave him 3291. a year, a double 
commissionership of the lottery gave him 600/, or 
7001. more; and, at a later period, his Editorship of 
the Quarterly Review gave him perhaps as much 
more. He rolled in his carriage for several years; 
he fared sumptuously ; he was buried at Westminster 
Abbey, of which his friend and formerly his brother 
pamphleteer in defence of Pirr was the Dean; and 
never is he to be heard of more! Mr, Girrorp would 
have been full as happy ; his health would have been 
better, his life longer, and his name would have

1] TO A YOUNG MAN 57 
lived for ages, if he could have turned to the bit of bacon and scrag of mutton in 1798; for his learn- ing and talents were such, his reasonings so clear and 
conclusive, and his wit so pointed and keen, that his writings must have been generally read, must have 
been of long duration! and, indeed, must have enabled him (he being always a single man) to live 
in his latter days in as good style as that which he procured by becoming a sinecurist, a pensioner and 
a hack, all which he was from the moment he lent 
himself to the Quarterly Review. Think of the 
mortification of such a man, when he was called upon 
to justify the power-of-imprisonment bill in 1817! 
But to go into particulars would be tedious: his life 
was a life of luxurious misery, than which a worse is 
not to be imagined. 
57. So that poverty is, except where there is an 
actual want of food and raiment, a thing much more 
imaginary than real. The shame of poverty, the 
shame of being thought poor, is a great and fatal 
weakness, though arising, in this country, from the 
fashion of the times themselves. When a good man, 
as in the phraseology of the city, means a rich man, 
we are not to wonder that every one wishes to be 
thought richer than he is. When adulation is sure 
to follow wealth, and when contempt would be 
awarded to many if they were not wealthy, who are 
oken of with deference, and even to the 
skies, because their riches are great and notorious; 
when this is the case, we are not to be surprised that 
men are ashamed to be thought to be poor, This is 
one of the greatest of all the dangers at the outeet 
of life: it has brought thousands and hundreds of 
to ruin, even to pecuniary ruin, One 
lable features in the character of 
that men never boast of thousands i 
of the most amial f 
‘American society is this;
-P-A-G-E-60
58 COBBETT’S ADVICE [Letter 
their riches, and never disguise their poverty ; but 
they talk of both as of any other matter fit for public 
conversation. No man shuns another because he is 
poor: no man is preferred to another because he 
is rich. In hundreds and hundreds of instances, men, 
not worth a shilling, have been chosen by the people 
and entrusted with their rights and interests, in 
preference to men who ride in their carriages. 
58. This shame of being thought poor, is not 
only dishonourable in itself, and fatally injurious to 
men of talent; but it is ruinous even in a pecuniary 
point of view, and equally destructive to farmers, 
traders, and even gentlemen of landed estate. It 
leads to everlasting efforts to disguise one’s poverty : 
the carriage, the servants, the wine, (oh, that fatal 
wine !) the spirits, the decanters, the glasses, all the 
table apparatus, the dress, the horses, the dinners, 
the parties, all must be kept up; not so much 
because he or she who keeps or gives them, has any 
pleasure arising therefrom, as because not to keep 
and give them, would give rise to a suspicion of 
the want of means so to give and keep; and thus 
thousands upon thousands are yearly brought inte 
a state of real poverty by their great anziety not to be 
thought poor. Look round you, mark well what you 
behold, and say if this be not the case. In how 
many instances have you seen most amiable and even 
most industrious families brought to ruin by nothing 
but this! Mark it well; resolve to set this false shame 
at defiance, and when you have done that, you have 
laid the first stone of the surest foundation of your 
future tranquillity of mind. There are thousands of 
families, at this very moment, who are thus strug- 
gling to keep up appearances. The farmers accom- 
modate themselves to circumstances more easily than 
tradesmen and professional men. They live at a
-P-A-G-E-61
Ty TO A YOUNG MAN 59 
greater distance from their neighbours: they can 
change their style of living unperceived: they can 
banish the decanter, change the dishes for a bit of 
bacon, make a treat out of a rasher and eggs, and 
the world is none the wiser all the while. But the 
tradesman, the doctor, the attorney, and the trader, 
cannot make the change so quietly, and unseen. 
‘The accursed wine, which is a sort of criterion of the 
style of living, a sort of scale to the plan, a sort of 
key to the tune; this is the thing to banish first 
of all; because all the rest follow, and come down to 
their proper level in a short time. The accursed 
decanter cries footman or waiting maid, puts bells to 
the side of the wall, screams aloud for carpets; and 
when I am asked, ‘Lord, what is a glass of wine?’ 
my answer is, that, in this country, it is everything ; 
it is the pitcher of the key ; it demands all the other 
unnecessary expenses ; it is injurious to health, and 
must be injurious, every bottle of wine that is drunk 
containing a certain portion of ardent spirits, besides 
other drugs deleterious in their nature; and, of all 
the friends to the doctors, this fashionable beverage 
is the greatest, And, which adds greatly to the 
folly, or, I should say, the real vice of using it, is, 
that the parties themselves, nine times out of ten, do 
not drink it by choice; do not like it; do not relish 
it; but use it from mere ostentation, being ashamed 
to be seen even by their own servants, not to drink 
wine. At the very moment I am writing this, there 
are thousands of families in and near London, who 
daily have wine upon their tables, and who drink it 
too, merely because their own servants should not 
suspect them to be poor, and not deem them to be 
genteel; and thus families by thousands are ruined, 
only because they are ashamed to be thought poor. 
59. There is no shame belonging to poverty, which
-P-A-G-E-62
60 COBBETT’S ADVICE [Letter 
frequently arises from the virtues of the impoverished 
jes, Not so frequently, indeed, as from vice, 
folly, and indiscretion; but still very frequently. 
And as the Scripture tells us, that we are not to 
‘despise the poor because he is poor’; so we ought 
not to honour the rich because he is rich, The true 
-way is, to take a fair survey of the character of a 
man as depicted in his conduct, and to respect him, 
or despise him, according to a due estimate of that 
character. No country upon earth exhibits so many, 
as this, of those fatal terminations of life, called 
suicides, These arise, in nine instances out of ten, 
from this very source. The victims are, in general, 
what may be fairly called insane ; but their insanity 
almost always arises from the dread of poverty ; not 
from the dread of a want of the means of sustaining 
life, or even decent living, but from the dread of 
being thought or known to be poor; from the dread 
of what is called falling in the scale of society; a 
dread which is prevalent hardly in any country but 
this. Looked at in its true light, what is there in 
poverty to make a man take away his own life? he 
is the same man that he was before: he has the 
same body and the same mind: if he even foresee a 
great alteration in his dress or his diet, why should 
kill himself on that account? Are these all the 
things that a man wishes to live for? But, such is 
the fact ; so great is the disg upon this country, 
and so numerous and terrible are the evils arising from this dread of being thought to be poor. 
60. Nevertheless, men ought to take care of their means, ought to use them prudently and sparingly, and to keep their expenses always within the bounds of their income, be it what it may. One of the effectual means of doing this is to purchase with ready money. Sr. Paut says, ‘Owe no man any-
-P-A-G-E-63
II] TO A YOUNG MAN 61 
thing :” and of his numerous precepts this is by no 
means the least worthy of our attention. Credit has 
been boasted of as a very fine thing: to decry credit 
seems to be setting oneself up against the opinions 
of the whole world ; and I remember a paper in the 
Frrenoiper or the Srecraror, published just after 
the funding system had begun, representing ‘ Pusiic 
Credit’ as a Goppess, enthroned in a temple dedi- 
cated to her by her votaries, amongst whom she is 
dispensing blessings of every description. It must 
be more than forty years since I read this paper, 
which I read soon after the time when the late Mr. 
Prrr uttered in Parliament an expression of his anxious 
hope, that his ‘ name would be inscribed on the monu- 
ment which he should raise to ‘public credit, Time 
has taught me, that Pustic Creprr means, the con- 
tracting of debts which a nation never can pay; and 
I have lived to see this Goddess produce e! . in 
my country, which Satan himself never could have 
produced. It is a very bewitching Goddess; and 
not less fatal in her influence in private than in public 
affairs, It has been carried in this latter respect to 
such a pitch, that scarcely any transaction, however 
low and inconsiderable in amount, takes place in any 
other way. There is a trade in London, called the 
‘ tally-trade,’ by which, household goods, coals, cloth- 
ing, all sorts of things, are sold upon credit, the seller 
keeping a éally, and receiving payment for the goods, little by little ; so that the income and the earnings of the buyers are always anticipated; are always 
gone, in fact, before they come in or are earned ; tl sellers receiving, of course, a great deal more than 
the proper profit, 61. Without supposing you to descend to so low 
a grade as this, and even supposing you to be lawyer, 
doctor, parson, or merchant ; it is still the same thing,
-P-A-G-E-64
62 COBBETT’S ADVICE [Letter 
if you purchase on credit, and not, perhaps, in a 
much less degree of disadvantage. Besides the higher 
price that you pay there is the temptation to have 
what you really do not want. The cost seems a trifle, 
when you have not to pay the money until a future 
time. It has been observed, and very truly observed, 
that men used to lay out a one-pound note when 
they would not lay out a sovereign ; a consciousness 
of the intrinsic value of the things produces a reten- 
tiveness in the latter case more than in the former : 
the sight and the touch assist the mind in forming 
its conclusions, and the one-pound note was parted 
with, when the sovereign would have been kept. Far 
greater is the difference between Credit and Read: 
money. Intfimerable things are not bought at : 
with ready money, which would be bought in case of 
trust : it is so much easier to order a thing than to 
pay for it. A future day; a day of payment must 
come, to be sure, but that is little thought of at the 
time; but if the money were to be drawn out, the 
moment the thing was received or offered, this ques- 
tion would arise, ‘Can I do without it?’ Is this 
thing indispensable ; am I compelled to have it, or 
suffer a loss or injury greater in amount than the 
cost of the thing? If this question were put, every 
time we make a purchase, seldom should we hear of 
those suicides which are such a disgrace to this 
country. 
62. I am aware, that it will be said, and very truly said, that the concerns of merchants ; that the pur- 
chasing of great estates, and various other great transactions, cannot be carried on in this manner ; but these are rare exceptions to the rule; even in these cases there might be much less of bills and bonds, and all the sources of litigation; but in the every-day business of life; in transactions with the
-P-A-G-E-65
IT} TO A YOUNG MAN 63 
butcher, the baker, the tailor, the shoemaker, what 
excuse can there be for pleading the example of the 
merchant, who carries on his work by ships and ex- 
changes? I was delighted, some time ago, by being 
told of a young man, who, upon being advised to 
keep a little account of all he received and expended, 
answered, ‘that his business was not to keep account 
books: that he was sure not to make a mistake as to 
his income ; and that, as to his expenditure, the little 
bag that held his sovereigns would be an infallible 
guide, as he never bought anything that he did not 
immediately pay for.’ 
63, I believe that nobody will deny, that, generally 
speaking, you pay for the same article a fourth part 
more in the case of trust than you do in the case of 
ready money. Suppose, then, the baker, butcher, 
tailor, and shoemaker, receive from you only one 
hundred pounds a year. Put that together ; that is 
to say, multiply twenty-five by twenty, and you will 
find, that, at the end of twenty years, you have 500/, 
besides the accumulating and growing interest. The 
fathers of the Church (I mean the ancient ones), and 
also the canons of the Church, forbade selling on 
trust at a higher price than for ready money, which 
was in effect to forbid ¢rust; and this, doubtless, 
was one of the great objects which those wise and 
ious men had in view ; for they were fathers in legis- 
Tation and morals as well as in religion, But the 
doctrine of these fathers and canons no longer pre- 
vails; they are set at nought by the present age, 
even in the countries that adhere to their religion. 
Appison’s Goddess has prevailed over the fathers and 
the canons; and men not only make a difference in 
the price regulated by the difference in the mode of 
Rayment ; but it would be absurd to expect them to 
lo otherwise. They must not only charge something
-P-A-G-E-66
64 COBBETT’S ADVICE [Letter 
for the want of the use of the money; but they must 
charge something additional for the risk of its loss, 
which may frequently arise, and most frequently does 
arise, from the misfortunes of those to whom they 
have assigned their goods on trust. The man, there- 
fore, who purchases on trust, not only pays for the 
trust, but he also pays his due share of what the 
tradesman loses by trust; and, after all, he is not so 
good a customer as the man who purchases cheaply 
with ready money ; for there is his name indeed in 
the tradesman’s book; but with that name the trades- 
man cannot go to market to get a fresh supply. 
64, Infinite are the ways in which gentlemen lose 
by this sort of dealing. Servants go and order some- 
times things not wanted at all; at other times, more 
than is wanted; at others, things of a higher 
quality and all this would be obviated by pur- 
chasing with ready money; for, whether through the 
hands of the party himself, or through those of an 
inferior, there would always be an actual counting 
out of the money; somebody would see the thing 
bought and see the money paid; and, as the master 
would give the housekeeper or steward a bag of money 
at the time, he would sce the money too, would set a 
proper value upon it; and would just desire to know 
upon what it had been expended. 
65. How is it that farmers are so exact, and show 
such a disposition to retrench in the article of labour, 
when they seem to think little, or nothing, about the 
sums which they pay in tax upon malt, wine, sugar, 
tea, soap, candles, tobacco, and various other things ? You the utmost difficulty in making them un- derstand, that they are affected by these. ‘The reason 
is, that they. see the money which they give to the labourer on each succeeding Saturday night; but they do not see that which they give in taxes on the
-P-A-G-E-67
Ty] TO A YOUNG MAN 65 
articles before mentioned. Why is it that they make 
such an outcry about the six or seven millions a year 
which are paid in poor-rates, and say not a word about 
the sixty millions a year raised in other taxes? The 
consumer pays all; and, therefore, they are as much 
interested in the one as the other; and yet the far- 
mers think of no tax but the poor tax. The reason 
is, that the latter is collected from them in money : 
they see it go out of their hands into the hands 
of another; and, therefore, they are everlastingly 
anxious to reduce the poor-rates, and they take care 
to keep them within the smallest possible bounds. 
66. Just thus would it be with every man that 
never purchased but with ready money: he would 
make the amount as low as possible in proportion to 
his means: this care and frugality would make an 
addition to his means, and therefore, in the end, at 
the end of his life, he would have had a great deal 
more to spend, and still be as rich as if he had gone 
in trust ; while he would have lived in tranquillity 
all the while, and would have avoided all the endless 
papers and writings and receipts and bills and dis- 
putes and law-suits inseparable from a system of 
credit, This is by no means a lesson of stinginess ; 
by no means tends to inculcate a heaping up of 
money; for the purchasing with ready money really 
gives you more money to purchase with; you can 
afford to have a greater quantity and variety of 
things; and I will engage that, if horses or servants 
be your taste, the saving in this way gives you an 
additional horse or an additional servant, if you be 
in any profession or engaged in any considerable 
trade. In towns, it tends to accelerate your pee 
along the streets ; for the temptation of the windows 
is answered in a moment by clapping your hand upon 
your thigh; and the question, ‘Do I really want ¥ : COBBETT. AD.
-P-A-G-E-68
66 COBBETT’S ADVICE [Letter 
that ?’ is sure to occur to you immediately, because 
the touch of the money is sure to put that thought 
in your mind. 
67. Now, supposing you to have a plenty; to have 
a fortune beyond your wants, would not the money 
which you would save in this way be very well ap- 
plied in acts of real benevolence? Can you walk 
many yards in the streets ; can you ride a mile in the 
country ; can you go to half-a-dozen cottages ; can 
you, in short, open your eyes, without seeing some 
human being, some.one born in the same country 
with yourself, and who, on that account alone, has 
some claim upon your good wishes and your charity ; 
can you open your eyes without seeing some person 
to whom even a small portion of your annual savings 
would convey gladness of heart? Your own heart 
will suggest the answer ; and, if there were no motive 
but this, what need I say more in the advice which I 
have here tendered to you ? 
68. Another great evil arising from this desire to 
be thought rich; or, rather from the desire not to be 
thought poor, is the destructive thing which has been 
honoured by the name of ‘speculation ;’ but which 
ought to be called Gambling. It is a purchasing of 
something which you do not want either in your 
family or in the way of ordinary trade: a something 
to be sold again with a great profit ; and on the sale 
of which there is a considerable hazard. When pur- 
chases of this sort are made with ready money, they 
are not so offensive to reason and not attended with 
such risk; but when they are made with money 
borrowed for the purpose, they are neither more nor 
less than gambling transactions; and they have been, 
in this country, a source of ruin, misery, and suicide, 
admitting of no adequate description. J grant that 
this gambling has arisen from the influence of the
-P-A-G-E-69
II] TO A YOUNG MAN 67 
‘Goddess’ before mentioned; I grant that it has 
arisen from the facility of obtaining the fictitious 
means of making the purchases; and I grant that 
that facility has been created by the system under 
the baneful influence of which we live. But it is not 
the less necessary that I beseech you not to practise 
such gambling ; that I beseech you, if you be engaged 
in it, to disentangle yourself from it as soon as you 
can. Your life, while you are thus engaged, is the 
life of the gamester; a life of constant anxiety ; 
constant desire to over-reach ; constant apprehen- 
sion; general gloom, enlivened, now and then, by a 
gleam of hope or of success. Even that success is 
sure to lead to further adventures; and, at last, a 
thousand to one, that your fate is that of the pitcher 
to the well. 
69. The great temptation to this gambling is, as 
is the case in other gambling, the success of the few. 
As young men who crowd to the army, in search of 
rank and renown, never look into the ditch that holds 
their slaughtered companions; but have their eye 
constantly fixed on the General-in-chief; and as 
each of them belongs to the same profession, and is 
sure to be conscious that he has equal merit, every 
one deems himself the suitable successor of him who 
is surrounded with Aides des camps, and who moves 
battalions and columns by his nod; so with the 
rising generation of ‘ speculators :’ they see the great 
estates that have succeeded the pencil-box and the 
orange-basket ; they see those whom nature and good 
laws made to black shoes, sweep chimnies or the 
streets, rolling in carriages, or sitting in saloons sur- 
rounded by gaudy footmen with napkins twisted 
round their thumbs; and they can see no earthly 
reason why they should not all do the same; for- 
getting the thousands and thousands, who, in making 
F
-P-A-G-E-70
68 COBBETT’S ADVICE [Letter 
the attempt, have reduced themselves to that beggary 
which, before their attempt, they would have re- 
garded as a thing wholly impossible. 
"10, In all situations of life, avoid the trammels of 
the law. -Man’s nature must be changed before law- 
guits will cease; and, perhaps, it would be next to 
impossible to make them less frequent than they are 
in the present state of this country; but though no 
man, who has any property at all, can say that he 
will have nothing to do with law-suits, it is in the 
power of most men to avoid them in a considerable 
degree. One good rule is to have as little as possible 
to do with any man who is fond of law-suits, and who, 
upon every slight occasion, talks of an appeal to the 
law. Such persons, from their frequent litigations, 
contract a habit of using the technical terms of the 
Courts, in which they take a pride, and are, there- 
fore, companions peculiarly disgusting to men of 
sense. To such men a law-suit is a luxury, instead 
of being as it is, to men of ordinary minds, a source 
of anxiety and a real and substantial scourge. Such 
men are always of a quarrelsome disposition, and 
avail themselves of every opportunity to indulge in 
that which is mischievous to their neighbours. In 
thousands of instances men go to law for the indul- 
gence of mere anger. The Germans are said to bring 
spite-actions against one another, and to harass their 
poorer neighbours from motives of pure revenge. 
y have carried this their disposition with them 
to America; for which reason no one likes to live in 
a German neighbourhood. . 
: 71. ‘Before you go to law consider well the cost; 
for if you win your suit and are poorer than you were 
before, what do you accomplish? You only imbibe 
a little additional anger against your opponent; you 
injure him, but do harm to yourself. tier to put

I] - TO A YOUNG MAN 69 
up with the loss of one pound than of two, to which 
latter is to be added all the loss of time, all the 
trouble, and all the mortification and anxiety attend- 
ing a law-suit. To set an attorney to work to worry 
and torment another man is a very base act; to 
alarm his family as well as himself, while you are 
sitting quietly at home. If a man owe you money 
which he cannot pay, why add to his distress without 
the chance of benefit to yourself? Thousands of men 
have injured themselves by resorting to the law; 
while very few ever bettered themselves by it, except 
such resort were unavoidable. 
72, Nothing is much more discreditable than what 
is called hard dealing. They say of the Turks, that 
they know nothing of two prices for the same article ; 
and that to ask an abatement of the lowest shop- 
keeper is to insult him. It would be well if Christians 
imitated Mahometans in this respect. To ask one 
price and take another, or to offer one price and give 
another, besides the loss of time that it occasions, is 
highly dishonourable to the parties, and especially 
when pushed to the extent of solemn protestations. 
It is, in fact, a species of lying; and it answers no 
one advantageous purpose to either buyer or seller. 
I hope that every young man who reads this, will 
start in life with a resolution never to higgle and lie 
in dealings. There is this circumstance in favour of 
the bookseller’s business: every book has its fixed 
price, and no one ever asks an abatement. If it 
were thus in all other trades, how much time would 
be saved, and how much immorality prevented ! 
78. As to the spending of your time, your business 
or your profession is to claim the priority of every- 
thing else. Unless that be duly attended to, there 
can be no real pleasure in any other employment of 
a portion of your time. Men, however, must have
-P-A-G-E-72
"0 COBBETT’S ADVICE [Letter 
some leisure, some relaxation from business; and in 
the choice of this relaxation much of your happiness 
will depend. Where fields and gardens are at Sand, 
they present the most rational scenes for leisure. 
As to company, I have said enough in the former 
letter to deter any young man from that of drunkards 
and rioting companions; but there is such a thing 
as your quiet ‘ pipe-and-pot-companions, which are, 
perhay the most fatal of all. Nothing can be con- 
ceived more dull, more stupid, more the contrary of 
edification and rational amusement, than sitting, 
sotting, over a pot and a glass, sending out smoke 
from the head, and articulating, at intervals, nonsense 
about all sorts of things. Seven years service as a 
galley-slave would be more bearable to a man of 
sense, than seven months confinement to society like 
this. Yet, such is the effect of habit, that, ifa young 
man become a frequenter of such scenes, the idle 
Propensity sticks to him for life. Some companions, 
owever, every man must have; but these every 
well-behaved man will find in private houses, where 
families are found residing and where the suitable 
intercourse takes place between women and men. 
A man that cannot pass an evening without drink 
merits the name of a sot. Why should there be 
drink for the purpose of carrying on conversation ? 
‘Women stand in need of no drink to stimulate them 
to converse; and I have a thousand times admired 
their patience in sitting quietly at their work, while 
their husbands are engaged, in the same room, with 
bottles and glasses before them, thinking nothing of 
the expense and still less of the shame which the 
distinction reflects upon them, We have to thank 
the women for many things, and particularly for 
their sobriety, for fear of followin their example in 
which men drive them from the teble, as if they said
-P-A-G-E-73
1] TO A YOUNG MAN 1 
to them: ‘You have had enough; food is sufficient 
for you; but we must remain to fill ourselves with 
drink, and to talk in language which your ears 
ought not to endure.’ When women are getting up 
to retire from the table, men rise in honour of them ; 
but they take special care not to follow their excel- 
lent example. ‘That which is not fit to be uttered 
before women is not fit to be uttered at all; and it 
is next to a proclamation, tolerating drunkenness and 
indecency, to send women from the table the moment 
they have swallowed their food. The practice has 
been ascribed to a desire to leave them to them- 
selves; but why should they be left to themselves? 
Their conversation is always the most lively, while 
their persons are generally the most agreeable objects. 
No: the plain truth is, that it is the love of the 
drink and of the indecent talk that send women from 
the table; and it is a practice which I have always 
abhorred. I like to see young men, especially, follow 
them out of the room, and prefer their company to 
that of the sots who are left behind. 
‘14, Another mode of spending the leisure time is 
that of books, Rational and well-informed com- 
panions may be still more instructive; but books 
never annoy ; they cost little; and they are always 
at hand, and ready at your call, The sort of books 
must, in some degree, depend upon your pursuit in 
life; but there are some books necessary to every one 
who aims at the character of a well-informed man. 
I have slightly mentioned History and Geography 
in the preceding letter; but I must here observe, 
that, as to both these, you should begin with your 
own country, and make yourself well acquainted, not 
only with its ancient state, but with the origin of all 
its principal institutions, To read of the battles 
which it fought, and of the intrigues by which

one king or one minister has succeeded another, is 
very little more profitable than the reading of a 
romance. To understand well the history of the 
country, you should first understand how it came to 
be divided into counties, hundreds, and into parishes; 
how judges, sheriffs, and juries, first arose; to what 
end they were all invented, and how the changes with 
respect to any of them have been produced. But it 
is of parti consequence that you ascertain the 
state of the people in former times, which is to be 
ascertained by comparing the then price of labour with 
the then price of "hod. You hear enough, and you 
read enough, about the glorious wars in the reign of 
Kine Epwanp the Tump; and it is very proper 
that those glories should be recorded and remem- 
bered; but you never read, in the works of the 
historians, that, in that reign, a common labourer 
earned threepence-halfpenny a day; and that a fat 
sheep was sold, at the same time, for one shilling and 
twopence, and a fat hog, two years old, for three 
shillings and fourpence, and a fat goose for twopence- 
halfpenny. You never read that women received 
a penny a day for hay-making or weeding in the 
corn, and that a gallon of red wine was sold for 
fourpence. hese are matters which historians have 
deemed to be beneath their notice; but they are 
matters of real importance: they are matters which

matter. This is not history; a list of battles and 
a string of intrigues are not history, they communi- 
cate no knowledge applicable to our present state ; 
and it really is better to amuse oneself with an 
avowed romance, which latter is a great deal worse 
than passing one’s time in counting the trees, 
15, History has been described as affording argu- 
ments of experience; as a record of what has been, 
in order to guide us as to what is likely to be, or 
what ought to be; but, from this romancing history, 
no such experience is to be derived: for it furnishes 
no facts on which to found arguments relative to the 
existing or future state of things. To come at the 
true history of a country you must read its laws: 
you must read books treating of its usages and 
customs in former times; and you must particularly 
inform yourself as to prices of labour and of food. 
By reading the single Act of the 28rd year of 
Epwarp the Turrp, specifying the price of labour at 
that time; by reading an Act of Parliament passed in 
the 24th year of Henry the Eicuru ; by reading these 
two Acts, and then reading the Curonicon Preciosum 
of Bishor FieEerwoop, which shows the price of food in 
the former reign, you come into full possession of 
the knowledge of what England was in former times. 
Divers books teach how the divisions of the countr 
arose, and how its great institutions were established ; 
and the result of this reading is a store of know- 
ledge, which will afford you pleasure for the whole 
of your life. 
16. History, however, is by no means the only 
thing about which every man’s leisure furnishes him 
with the means of reading; besides which, every man 
has not the same taste. Poetry, geography, moral 
essays, the divers subjects of philosophy, travels, 
natural history, books on sciences ; and, in short, the

I read the works of Pore and of Swirr, I was greatly 
delighted with their lashing of Drxnis; but won- 
dered, at the same time, why they should have taken 
so much pains in running down such a fool. By 
the merest accident in the world, being at a tavern 
in the woods of America, I took up an old book, 
in order to pass away the time while my travel- 
ling companions were drinking in the next room; 
but seeing the book contained the criticisms of 
Dennis, I was about to lay it down, when the play 
of ‘Caro’ caught my eye; and having been accus- 
tomed to read books in which this play was lauded 
to the skies, and knowing it to have been written 
by Appison, every line oF whose works I had been 
taught to believe teemed with wisdom and genius, 
I condescended to begin to read, though the work 
was from the pen of that fool Dennis. I read on, and soon began to laugh, not at Dennis, but at 
Addison. I laughed so much and so loud, that the landlord, who was in the Passage, came in to see what I was laughing at. In short, I found it a most masterly production, one of the most witty things
-P-A-G-E-77
1] TO A YOUNG MAN 15 
that I had ever read in my life. I was delighted 
with Dennis, and was heartily ashamed of my former 
admiration of Cato, and felt no little resentment 
against Porz and Swirt for their endless reviling of 
this most able and witty critic. This, as far as 
I recollect, was the first emancipation that had 
assisted me in my reading. I have, since that time, 
never taken any thing upon trust: I have judged 
for myself, trusting neither to the opinions of writers 
nor in the fashions of the day. Having been told 
by Dr. Braz, in his lectures on Rhetoric, that, if 
I meant to write correctly, I must ‘give my days 
and nights to Appison,’ I read a few numbers of the 
Spectator at the time I was writing my English 
Grammar: I gave neither my nights nor my days 
to him; but I found an abundance of matter to 
afford examples of false grammar; and, upon a re- 
erusal, I found that the criticisms of Dennis might 
ve been extended to this book too. 
77. But that which never ought to have been 
forgotten by those who were men at the time, and 
that which ought to be made known to every young 
man of the present day, in order that he may be 
induced to exercise his own judgment with regard to 
books, is, the transactions relative to the writings 
of Suaxsrgzare, which transactions took place about 
thirty years ago. It is still, and it was then much 
more, the practice to extol every line of SHaKsPEaRE 
to the skies: not to admire SHaxspeare has been 
deemed to be a proof of want of understanding and 
taste. Mr. Garrick, and some others after him, 
had their own good and profitable reasons for crying 
up the works of this poet. When I was a very little 
boy, there was a jubilee in honour of SHAKSPEARE, 
and as he was said to have planted a Mulberry tree, 
boxes, and other little ornamental things in wood,
-P-A-G-E-78
16 COBBETT’S ADVICE [Letter 
‘were sold all over the country, as having been made 
out of the trunk or limbs of this ancient and sacred 
tree. We Protestants laugh at the relics so highly 
prized by Catholics ; but never was a Catholic people 
half so much duped by the relics of saints, as this 
nation was by the mulberry tree, of which, probably, 
more wood was sold than would have been sufficient 
in quantity to build a ship of war, or a large house. 
This madness abated for some years; but, towards 
the end of the last century it broke out again with 
more fury than ever, Suaxspeare’s works were 
published by Boypex1, an Alderman of London, at 
a subscription of five hundred pounds for each copy, 
accompanied by plates, each forming a large picture. 
Amongst the mad men of the day was a Mx. IreLanp, 
who seemed to be more mad than any of the rest. 
His adoration of the poet led him to perform a 
pilgrimage to an old farm-house, near Stratford-upon- 
Avon, said to have been the birth-place of the poet. 
Arrived at the spot, he requested the farmer and his 
wife to let him search the house for papers, jirst 
going upon his knees, and praying, in the poetic 
style, the gods to aid him in his quest. He found 
no papers; but he found that the farmer’s wife, in 
clearing out a garret some years before, had found 
some rubbishy old papers which she had burnt, and 
which had probably been papers used in the wrap- 
ping up of pigs’ cheeks to keep them from the bats.

what you have done?” ‘O dear, no!’ said the

additional degree of excitement, as it is now fashion- 
ably called: he raved, he stamped, he foamed, and at 
last quitted the house, covering the poor woman with

every term of reproach; and hastening back to 
Stratford, took post-chaise for London, to relate to 
his brother madmen the horrible sacrilege of this 
heathenish woman, Unfortunately for Mz. Inntanp, 
unfortunately for his learned brothers in the metro- 
polis, and unfortunately for the reputation of Suax- 
SPEARE, Mr. IneLanp took with him to the scene of 
his adoration a son, about sixteen years of age, who 
was articled to an attorney in London. The son 
was by no means so sharply bitten as the father; and, 
upon returning to town, he conceived the idea of 
supplying the place of the invaluable papers which 
the farm-house heathen had destroyed. He thought, 
and he thought rightly, that he should have little 
difficulty in writing plays just like those of Shak- 
speare! To get paper that should seem to have been 
made in the reign of Queen Exizazeru, and ink that 
should give to writing the appearance of having the 
same age, was somewhat difficult; but both were 
overcome, Young IRELAND was acquainted with a 
son of a bookseller, who dealt in old books: the blank 
leaves of these books supplied the young author with 
paper ; and he found out the way of making proper 
Ink for his purpose. To work he went, wrote several 
plays, some love-letters, and other things ; and having 
got a Bible, extant in the time of Suaxsrrarz, he 
wrote notes in the margin. All these, together with 
sonnets in abundance, and other little detached 
pieces, he produced to his father, telling him he got 
them from a gentleman, who had made him swear 
that he would not divulge his name. The father an- 
nounced the invaluable discovery to the literary 
world : the literary world rushed to him; the manu- 
scripts were regarded as genuine by the most grave 
and learned Doctors, some of whom (and amongst 
these were Docrors Parr and Warron) gave, under
-P-A-G-E-80
8 COBBETT’S ADVICE {Letter 
their hands, an opinion, that the manuscripts must 
have been written by Suaxsreare; for that no other 
man in the world could have been capable of writing 
them! 
78. Mr. Inevanp opened a subscription, published 
these new and invaluable manuscripts at an enormous 
price; and preparations were instantly made for 
performing one of the plays, called Vorticrrn. Soon 
after the acting of the play, the indiscretion of the 
lad caused the secret to explode; and, instantly, 
those who had declared that he had written as well 
as SuaxsreaRe, did every thing in their power to 
destroy him! 'The attorney drove him from his office ; 
the father drove him from his house ; and, in short, 
he was hunted down as if he had been a male- 
factor of the worst description, The truth of this 
relation is undeniable; it is recorded in number- 
less books, The young man is, I believe, yet alive ; 
and, in short, no man will question any one of the 
facts. ° 
79. After this, where is the person of sense who 
will be guided in these matters by fashion ? where is 
the man, who wishes not to be deluded, who will not, 
when he has read a book, judge for himself? After 
all these jubilees and pilgrimages; after BoypEx1’s 
subscription of 5002. for one single copy ; after it had 
been deemed almost impiety to doubt of the genius 
of SHAKSPEARE surpassing that of all the rest of man- 
kind ; after he had been called the ‘ Immortal Bard, 
as a matter of course, as we speak of Mosxs and Aaron, there having been but one of each in the 
world ; after all this, comes a lad of sixteen years of age, writes that which learned Doctors declare could have been written by no man but SHaxspzarE, and, when it is discovered that this laughing boy is the real author, the Docrors turn round upon him, with
-P-A-G-E-81
It] TO A YOUNG MAN 79 
all the newspapers, magazines, and reviews, and, of 
course, the public at their back, revile him as an 
impostor; and, under that odious name, hunt him 
out of society, and doom him to starve! This lesson, 
at any rate, he has given us: not to rely on the 
judgment of Doctors and other pretenders to literary 
superiority. Every young man, when he takes up 
a Pook for the first time, ought to remember this 
story; and if he do remember it, he will disregard 
fashion with regard to the book, and will pay little 
attention to the decision of those who call themselves 
critics. 
80. I hope that your taste would keep you aloof 
from the writings of those detestable villains, who 
employ the powers of their mind in debauching the 
minds of others, or in endeavours to do it. They 
present their poison in such captivating forms, that 
it requires great virtue and resolution to withstand 
their temptations; and, they have, perhaps, done 
a thousand times as much mischief in the world as 
all the infidels and atheists put together. These 
men ought to be called literary pimps: they ought to 
be held in universal abhorrence, and never spoken of 
but with execration. Any appeal to bad passions 
is to be despised ; any appeal to ignorance and pre- 
judice ; but here is an appeal to the frailties of human 
nature, and an endeavour to make the mind corrupt, 
just as it is beginning to possess its powers. I never 
have known any but bad. men, worthless men, men 
unworthy of any portion of respect, who took delight 
in, or even kept in their possession, writings of the 
description to which I here allude. ‘The writings of 
Swirr have this blemish; and, though he is not 
a teacher of Jewdness, but rather the contrary, 
there are certain parts of his poems which are 
much too filthy for any decent person to. read.

It was beneath him to stoop to such means of 
setting forth that wit which would have been far 
more brilliant without them. I have heard, that, in 
the library of what is called an ‘illustrious person,’ 
sold some time ago, there was an immense col- 
lection of books of this infamous description; and 
from this circumstance, if from no other, I should 
have formed my judgment of the character of that 
person. 
81. Besides reading, a young man ought to write, 
if he have the capacity and the leisure. If you wish 
to remember a thing well, put it into writing, even 
if you burn the paper immediately after you have 
done; for the eye greatly assists the mind.. Memory 
consists of a concatenation of ideas, the place, the 
time, and other circumstances, lead to the recollection 
of facts ; and no circumstance more effectually than 
stating the facts upon paper. A Jovrnat should be 
kept by every young man. Put down something 
inst every day in the year, if it be merely a de- 
scription of the weather. You will not have done 
this for one year without finding the benefit of it. 
It disburthens the mind of many things to be recol- 
lected ; it is amusing and useful, and ought by no 
means to be neglected. How often does it happen 
that we cannot make a statement of facts, sometimes 
very interesting to ourselves and our friends, for the 
want of a record of the places where we were, and 
of things that occurred on such and such a day! 
How often does it happen that we get into disagree- 
able disputes about things that have passed, and 
about the time and other circumstances attending them! As a thing of mere curiosity, it is of some yalue,and may frequently prove of very great utility. It demands not more than a minute in the twenty- four-hours; and that minute is. most agreeably and

LETTER III 
TO A LOVER 
82, TuERe are two descriptions of Lovers on whom 
all advice would be wasted ; namely, those in whose 
minds passion so wholly overpowers reason as to 
deprive the party of his sober senses. Few people 
are entitled to more compassion than young men 
thus affected : it is a species of insanity that assails 
them; and, when it” produces self-destruction, which 
it does in England more frequently than in all the 
other countries in the world put together, the mortal 
remains of the sufferer ought to be dealt with in as 
tender a manner as that of which the most merciful 
construction of the law will allow. If Sm Samurn 
Romuy’s remains were, as they were, in fact, treated 
as those of a person labouring under ‘temporary 
mental derangement,’ surely the youth who destroys ° 
his life on account of unrequited love, ought to 
considered in as mild alight! Sim Samvet was repre- 
sented, in the evidence taken before the Coroner's 
Jury, to bave been inconsolable for the loss of his 
wife, that this loss had so dreadful an effect upon 
his mind, that it bereft him of his reason, made life 
insup table, and led him to commit the act of 
sic: and, on this alone, his remains and 
his estate Were rescued from the awful, though just 
and wise, Sentence of the law. But, unfortunately 
for the reputation of the administration of that just 
and wise 1@¥> there had been, only about two years
-P-A-G-E-85
ADVICE TO A LOVER 83 
before, a poor man, at Manchester, buried in cross- 
roads, and under circumstances which entitled his 
remains to mercy much more clearly than in the case 
of Siz Saver Romiity. 
83, This unfortunate youth, whose, name was 
Smiru, and who was a shoemaker, was in love with a 
young woman, who, in spite of all his importunities 
and his proofs of ardent passion, refused to marry 
him, and even discovered her liking for another; and 
he, unable to support life, accompanied by the thought 
of her being in possession of any body but himself, 
put an end to his life by the means of a Tope. If, in 
any case, we are to presume the existence of insanity ; 
if, in any case, we are led to believe the thing with- 
out positive proof’; if, in any case, there can be an 
apology in human nature itself, for such an act ; this 
was that case. We all know (as I observed at the 
time); that is to say, all of us who cannot wait to 
calculate upon the gains and losses of the affair; all 
of us, except those who are endowed with this pro- 
vident frigidity, know well what youthful love is; 
and what its torments are, when accompanied by even 
the smallest portion of jealousy. Every man, and 
especially every Englishman (for here we seldom love 
or hate by halves), will recollect how many mad 
pranks he has played ; how many wild and ridiculous 
things he has said and done between the age of 
sixteen and that of twenty-two; how many times a 
kind glance has scattered all his reasoning and reso- 
lutions to the winds; how many times a cool look 
has plunged him into the deepest misery! Poor 
Ssurn, who was at this age of love and madness, 
might, surely, be presumed to have done the deed in 
a moment of ‘temporary mental derangement, - He 
was an object of compassion in every humane breast : 
he had parents and brethren and kindred and friends

to lament his death, and to feel shame at the disgrace 
inflicted on his lifeless body: yet, HE was pro- 
nounced to be a felo de se, or self-murderer, and his 
body was put into a hole by the way-side, with a 
stake driven down through it; while that of Rommu.ty 
had mercy extended to it, on the ground that the 
act had een occasioned by ‘temporary mental de- 
rangement, caused by his grief for the death of his 
wife ! 
84, To reason with passion like that of the unfor- 
tunate Smirn, is perfectly useless ; you may, with as 
much chance of success, reason and remonstrate with 
the winds or the waves: if you make impression, it 
lasts but for a moment: your effort, like an inade- 
uate stoppage of waters, only adds, in the end, to 
the violence of the torrent: the current must have 
and will have its course, be the consequences what 
they may. In cases not quite so decided, absence, 
the sight of new faces, the sound of new voices, gene- 
rally serve, if not as a radical cure, as a mitigation, 
at least, of the disease. But, the worst of it is, that, 
on this point, we have the girls (and women too) 
against us! For they look upon it as right that 
every lover should be a Kittle maddish ; and, every 
attempt to rescue him from the thraldom imposed 
by their charms, they look upon as an overt act of 
treason against their natural sovereignty. No girl 
ever liked a young man less for his having done 
things foolish and wild and ridiculous, provided she 
was sure that love of her had been the cause: let her 
but be satisfied upon this score, and there are ve 
few things which she will not forgive. And, though 
wholly unconscious of the fact, she is a great and 
sound philosopher after all. For, from the nature of 
things, the rearing of a family always has been, is, 
and must ever be, attended with cares and troubles,
-P-A-G-E-87
TI] TO A LOVER 85 
which must infallibly produce, at times, feelings to 
be combated and overcome by nothing short of that 
ardent affection which first brought the parties to- 
gether. So that, talk as long as Parson Matraus 
Iikes about ‘ moral restraint ;” and report as long as 
the Committees of Parliament please about prevent- 
ing ‘premature and improvident marriages’ amongst 
the labouring classes, the passion that they would 
restrain, while it is necessary to the existence of man- 
kind, is the greatest of all the compensations for the 
inevitable cares, troubles, hardships, and sorrows of 
life ; and, as to the marriages, if they could once be 
rendered universally provident, every generous senti- 
ment would quickly be banished from the world. 
85. The other description of lovers, with whom it 
is useless to reason, are those who love according to 
the rules of arithmetic, or who measure their matri- 
monial expectations by the chain of the land-surveyor. 
These are not love and marriage; they are bargain 
and sale. Young men will naturally, and almost 
necessarily, fix their choice on young women in their 
own rank in life ; because from habit and intercourse 
they will know them best. But, if the length of the 
girl’s purse, present or contingent, be a consideration 
with the man, or the length of his purse, present or 
contingent, be a consideration with her, it is an 
affair of bargain and sale. I know that kings, princes, 
and princesses are, in respect of marriage, restrained 
by the law: I know that nobles, if not thus re- 
strained by positive law, are restrained, in fact, by 
the very nature of their order. And here is a dis- 
advantage which, as far as real enjoyment of life is 
concerned, more than counterbalances all the ad- 
vantages that they possess over the rest of the com- 
munity. This disadvantage, generally speaking, 
pursues rank and riches downwards, till you approac!
-P-A-G-E-88
86 COBBETT’S ADVICE {Letter 
very nearly to that numerous class who live by manual 
labour, becoming, however, less and less as you descend. 
You generally find even very vulgar rich men mak- 
ing a sacrifice of their natural and rational taste to 
their mean and ridiculous pride, and thereby pro- 
viding for themselves an ample supply of misery for 
life. “By preferring ‘provident marriages’ to mar- 
riages of love, they think to secure themselves against 
all the evils of poverty; but, if poverty come, and 
come it may, and frequently does, in spite of the best 
laid plans, and best modes of conduct; if poverty 
* come, then where is the counterbalance for that ardent 
mutual affection, which troubles, and losses, and crosses 
always increase rather than diminish, and which, 
amidst all the calamities that can befall a man, 
whispers to his heart, that his best possession is 
still left him unimpaired? The WorcrsrensuirE 
Baronet, who has had to endure the sneers of fools 
on account of his marriage with a beautiful and vir- 
tuous servant maid, would, were the present ruinous 
measures of the Government to drive him from his 
mansion to a cottage, still have a source of happiness ; 
while many of those, who might fall in company with 
him, would, in addition to all their other troubles, 
have, perhaps, to endure the reproaches of wives to 
whom poverty, or even humble life, would be insup- 
portable. 
86. If marrying for the sake of money be, under 
any circumstances, despicable, if not disgraceful ; if 
it be, generally king, a species of legal prostitu- 
tion, only a little Jess shameful than that which, 
under some governments, is openly licensed for the 
sake of a tax; if this be the case generally, what 
ought to be said of a young man, who, in the heyday 
of youth, should couple himself on to a libidinous 
woman, old enough, perhaps, to be his grandmother,
-P-A-G-E-89
Wj TO A LOVER 87 
ugly as the nightmare, offensive alike to the sight 
and the smell, and who should pretend to Jove her 
too: and all this merely for the sake of her money? 
Why, it ought, and it, doubtless, would be said of him, 
that his conduct was a libel on both man and woman- 
kind; that his name ought, for ever, to be synony- 
mous with baseness and nastiness, and that in no age 
and in no nation, not marked by a general depravity 
of manners, and total absence of all sense of shame, 
every associate, male or female, of such a man, or of 
his filthy mate, would be held in abhorrence. Public 
morality would drive such a hateful pair from society, 
and strict justice would hunt them from the face of 
the earth. 
87. Buonararre could not be said to marry for 
money, but his motive was little better. It was for 
dominion, for power, for ambition, and that, too, of 
the most contemptible kind. I knew an American 
Gentleman, with whom Buonaraxre had always been 
a great favourite; but the moment the news arrived 
of his divorce and second marriage, he gave him up. 
This piece of grand prostitution was too much to be 
defended. And the truth is, that Buonararre might 
have dated his decline from the day of that marriage. 
My American friend said, ‘If I had been he, I would 
in the first place, have married the poorest and 
prettiest girl in all France.’ If he had done this, he 
would, in all probability, have now been on an im- 
rial throne, instead of being eaten by worms at the 
Bottom of avery deep hole in Saint Helena; whence, 
however, his bones convey to the world the moral, 
that to marry for money, for ambition, or from any 
motive other than the one pointed out by affec- 
tion, is not the road to glory, to happiness, or to 
pe ACE. 
88, Let me now turn from these two descriptions
-P-A-G-E-90
88 COBBETT’S ADVICE [Letter 
of lovers, with whom it is useless to reason, and 
dress myself to you, my reader, whom I suppose to 
e a real lover, but not so smitten as to be bereft of 
Your reason. You should never forget, that mar- 
e, which is a state that every young person ought 
ve in view, is a thing to last for life; and that, 
generally speaking, it is to make life happy, or miser- 
able ; for, though a man may bring his mind to some- 
thing nearly a state of indifference, even that is misery, 
except with those who can hardly be reckoned 
amongst sensitive beings. Marriage brings nume- 
rous cares, which are amply compensated by the more 
numerous delights which are their companions. But 
to have the delights, as well as the cares, the choice 
of the partner must be fortunate. I say fortunate ; 
for, after all, love, real love, impassioned affection, is 
an i lient so absolutely necessary, that no perfect 
reliance can be placed on the judgment. Yet, the 
judgment may do something; reason may have some 
influence ; and, therefore, I here offer you my advice 
with regard to the exercise of that reason. 
89. The things which you ought to desire in a wife 
are, 1. Chastity; 2. sobriety ; 3. industry; 4. fru- 
gality ; 5. cleanliness; 6. knowledge of domestic 
affairs ; 7. good temper; 8. beauty. 
90. I. Crasmrry, perfect modesty, in word, deed, 
and even thought, is so essential, that, without it, no 
female is fit to be a wife, It is not enough that a 
young woman abstain from everything approaching 
towards indecorum in her behaviour towards men ; 
it is, with me, not enough that she cast down her 
eyes, or turn aside her head with a smile, when she 
hears an indelicate allusion : she ought to appear not 
to understand it, and to receive from it no more im- 
pression than if she were a post. A loose woman is 
a disagreeable acquaintance : what must she be, then,
-P-A-G-E-91
I) TO A LOVER 89 
as a wife? Love is so blind, and vanity is so busy 
in persuading us that our own qualities will be suffi- 
cient to ensure fidelity, that we are very apt to think 
nothing, or, at any rate, very little, of trifling 
symptoms of levity; but if such symptoms show 
themselves now, we may be well assured, that we shall 
never possess the power of effecting a cure. If 
rudery mean false modesty, it is to be despised ; 
ut if it mean modesty pushed to the utmost extent, 
I confess that I like it. Your ‘free and hearty” girls 
I have liked very well to talk and laugh with ; but 
never, for one moment, did it enter into my mind that 
I could have endured a ‘ free and hearty’ girl for a 
wife. The thing is, I repeat, to last for life; it is 
to be a counterbalance for troubles and misfortunes ; 
and it must, therefore, be perfect, or it had better 
not be at all. To say that one despises jealousy is 
foolish ; it is a thing to be lamented; but the vi 
elements of it ought to be avoided. Gross indeed is 
the beast, for he is unworthy of the name of man ; 
nasty indeed is the wretch, who can even entertain 
the thought of putting himself between a pair of 
sheets with a wife of whose infidelity he possesses the 
proof; but, in such cases, a man ought to be very 
slow to believe appearances; and he ought not to 
decide against his wife but upon the clearest proof. 
The last, and, indeed, the only effectual safeguard is, 
to begin well; to make a good choice; to let the 
beginning be such as to render infidelity and jealousy 
next to impossible. If you begin in grossness; if 
you couple yourself on to one with whom you have 
taken liberties, infidelity is the natural and just 
consequence. When a Peer of the realm, who had 
not been over-fortunate in his matrimonial affairs, 
was urging Masor Carrwricur to seek for nothing 
more than ‘ moderate reform, the Major (forgetting
-P-A-G-E-92
90 COBBETT’S ADVICE [Letter 
the domestic circumstances of his Lordship) asked 
him how he should relish ‘ moderate chastity’ in a 
wife! The bare use of the two words, thus coupled 
together, is sufficient to excite disgust. Yet with 
this ‘moderate chastity’ you must be, and ought to 
be, content, if you have entered into marriage with 
one, in whom you have ever discovered the slightest 
approach towards lewdness, either in deeds, words, or 
looks. ‘To marry has been your own act; you have 
made the contract for your own gratification; you 
knew the character of the other party; and the chil- 
dren, if any, or the community, are not to be the 
‘sufferers for your gross and corrupt passion. ‘ Mode- 
rate chastity’ is all that you have, in fact, contracted 
for: you have it, and you have no reason to com- 
lain. When I come to address myself to the 
usband, I shall have to say more upon this subject, 
which I dismiss for the present with observing, that 
my observation has convinced me, that, when families 
are rendered unhappy from the existence of ‘ mode- 
rate chastity,’ the fault, first or last, has been in the 
man, ninety-nine times out of every hundred. 
91. Soszrery. By sobriety I do not mean merely 
an absence of drinking to a state of intoxication ; for, 
if that be hateful in a man, what must it be in a 
woman! ‘There is a Latin proverb, which says, that 
wine, that is to say, intoxication, brings forth truth. 
Whatever it may do in this way, in men, in women it 
is sure, unless prevented by age or by salutary ugli- 
ness, to produce a moderate, and a very moderate, 
portion of chastity. There neverwas a drunken woman, 
& woman who loved strong drink, who was chaste, 
if the opportunity of being the contrary presented 
itself to her. There are cases where health requires 
Wine, and even small portions of more ardent liquor ; 
% (reserving what I have further to say on this
-P-A-G-E-93
1] TO A LOVER 91 
point, till I come to the conduct of the husband) 
young unmarried women can seldom stand in need 
of these stimulants; and, at any rate, only in cases 
of well-known definite ailments. Wine! ‘only a 
glass or two of wine at dinner, or so’! As soon as 
have married a girl whom I had thought liable to 
be persuaded to drink, habitually, ‘only a glass or 
two of wine at dinner, or so;’ as soon as have 
married such a girl, I would have taken a strumpet 
from the streets. And it has not required age to 
give me this way of thinking: it has always been 
rooted in my mind from the moment that I began to 
think the girls prettier than posts. ‘There are few 
things so disgusting as a guzzling woman. A gor- 
mandizing one is bad enough; but, one who tips off 
the liquor with an appetite, and exclaims ‘ good! 
good!’ by a smack of her lips, is fit for nothing but 
a brothel. There may be cases, amongst the hard- 
labouring women, such as reapers, for instance, espe- 
cially when they have children at the breast; there 
may be cases, where very hard-working women may 
stand in need of a little good beer; ‘beer, which, if 
taken in immoderate quantities, would produce in- 
toxication. But, while I only allow the possibility 
of the existence of such cases, I deny the necessity of 
any strong drink at all in every other case. Yet, in 
this metropolis, it is the general custom for trades- 
men, journeymen, and even labourers, to have regu- 
larly on their tables the big brewers’ poison, twice in 
every day, and at the rate of not less than a pot to 
a person, women, as well as men, as the allowance for the day. A pot of poison a day, at fivepence the 
pot, amounts to seven pounds and two shillings in the 
year! Man and wife suck down, in this way,. fourteen pounds four shillings a year! Is it any 
wonder that they are clad in rags, that they are skin
-P-A-G-E-94
92 COBBETT’S ADVICE [Letter 
and bone, and that their children are covered with 
filth ? 
92. But by the word Sozriery, in a young woman, 
I mean a great deal more than even a rigid absti- 
nence from that love of drink, which I am not to 
suppose, and which I do not believe, to exist any 
thing like generally amongst the young women of 
this country. I mean a great deal more than this; 
I mean sobriety of conduct. The word sober, and its 
derivatives, do not confine themselves to matters of 
drink : they express steadiness, seriousness, careful- 
NESS, serupulous ‘propriety of conduct; and they are 
thus used amongst country people in many parts of 
England. When a Somersetshire fellow makes too 
free with a girl, she reproves him with, ‘Come! be 
sober!” And when we wish a team, or any thing, 
to be moved on steadily and with great care, we 
ery out to the carter, or other operator, ‘Soberly, 
soberly” Now, this species of sobriety is a great 
qualification in the person you mean to make your 
wife. Skipping, capering, romping, rattling girls 
are very amusing where all costs and other con- 
sequences are out of the question; and they 
become sober in the Somersetshire sense of the word. 
But while you have no certainty of this, you have 
a presumptive argument on the other side. To be 
sure, when es are mere children, they are to play 
and romp like children. But, when they arrive at 
that age which turns their thoughts towards that 
sort of connexion which is to be theirs for life; when 
they begin to think of having the command of a house, however small or poor, it is time for them 
to cast away the levity of the child. It is natural, 
nor is it very wrong, that I know of, for children to like to about and to see all sorts of stran; 
sights, though I do not approve of this even in
-P-A-G-E-95
Ti] TO A LOVER 93 
children: but, if I could not have found a you 
woman (and I am sure I never should have marri 
an old one) who I was not sure possessed all the 
qualities expressed by the word sobriety, I should have 
remained a bachelor to the end of that life, which, 
in that case, would, I am satisfied, have terminated 
without my having performed a thousandth part of 
those labours which have been, and are, in spite 
of all political prejudice, the wonder of all who have 
seen, or heard of, them. Scores of gentlemen have, 
at different times, expressed to me their surprise, 
that I was ‘always in spirits ;’ that nothing pulled 
me down; and the truth is, that, throughout nearly 
forty years of troubles, losses, and crosses, assailed 
all the while by more numerous and powerful enemies 
than ever man had before to contend with, and per- 
forming, at the same time, labours greater than man 
ever before performed ; all those labours requiring 
mental exertion, and some of them mental exer- 
tion of the highest order; the truth is, that, 
throughout the whole of this long time of troubles 
and of labours, I have never known a, single hour of 
real anaiety; the troubles have been no troubles to 
me; I have not known what lowness of spirits meaned ; 
have been more gay, and felt less care, than any 
bachelor that ever lived. ‘ You are always in spirits, 
Cobbett!’ To be sure; for why should I not? 
Poverty I have always set at defiance, and I could, 
therefore, defy the temptations of riches; and, as 
to home and children, I had taken care to provide 
myself with an inexhaustible store of that ‘ sobriety,’ 
which I am so strongly recommending my reader 
to provide himself with ; or, if he cannot do that, to 
deliberate long before he ventures on the life-enduring 
matrimonial voyage, This sobriety is a title to trust- 
worthiness ; and. this, young man, is the treasure that
-P-A-G-E-96
94 COBBETT’S ADVICE [Letter 
you ought to rize far above all others. Miserable 
is the husband, who, when he crosses the threshold 
of his house, carries with him doubts and fears and 
suspicions. I do not mean suspicions of the fidelity 
of his wife, but of her care, frugality, attention to 
his interests, and to the health and morals of his 
children. Miserable is the man, who cannot leave 
all unlocked, and who is not sure, quite certain, that 
all is as safe as if grasped in his own hand. He is 
the happy husband, who can go away, at a moment’s 
warning, leaving his house and his family with as 
little anxiety as he quits an inn, not more fearing 
to find, on his return, any thing wrong, than he 
would fear a discontinuance of the rising and setting 
of the sun, and if, as in my case, leaving books 
and papers all lying about at sixes and sevens, 
finding them arranged in proper order, and the 
room, during the lucky interval, freed from the 
effects of his and his ploughman’s or gardener’s 
dirty shoes. Such a man has no real cares; such 
a man has no troubles; and this is the sort of life 
that I have led. I have had all the numerous and 
indescribable delights of home and children, and, 
at the same time, all the bachelor’s freedom from 
domestic cares: and to this cause, far more than 
to any other, my readers owe those labours, which 
T never could have performed, if even the slightest 
degree of want of confidence at home had ever once 
entered into my mind. 
98. But, in order to possess this precious trust- 
worthiness, you must, if you can, exercise your reason 
jn the choice of your partner. If she be vain of. her 
_person, very fond of dress, fond of flattery, at all 
given to gadding about, fond of what are called 
parties of pleasure, or coquetish, though in the least 
degree; if either of these, she never will be trust-
-P-A-G-E-97
I] TO A LOVER 95 
worthy ; she cannot change her nature; and if you 
marry her, you will be wnjust if you expect trust- 
worthiness at her hands. But, besides this, even if 
ou find in her that innate ‘sobriety, of which I 
ve been speaking, there requires on your part, and 
that at once too, confidence and trust without an: 
limit. Confidence is, in this case, nothing unless it 
be reciprocal. To have a trustworthy wife, you 
must begin by showing her, even before you are 
married, that you have no suspicions, no fears, no 
doubts, with regard to her. Many a man has been 
discarded by a virtuous girl, merely on account of

which I have not practised, I will give you the history 
of my own conduct in this respect. 
94, When I first saw my wife, she was thirteen 
years old, and I was within about a month of twenty- 
one. She was the daughter of a, Serjeant of artillery, 
and I was the Serjeant-Major of a regiment of foot, 
both stationed in forts near the city of St. John, in 
the Province of New-Brunswick. I sat in the same 
room with her, for about an hour, in company with 
others, and I made up my mind that she was the 
very girl for me. That I thought her beautiful is 
certain, for that I had always said should be an 
indispensable qualification; but I saw in her what 
I deemed marks of that sobriety of conduct of which 
I have said so much, and which has been by far the 
greatest blessing of my life. It was now dead of 
winter, and, of course, the snow several feet deep on 
the ground, and the weather piercing cold. It was 
my habit, when I had done my morning's writing,
-P-A-G-E-98
96 COBBETT’S ADVICE [Letter 
to go out at break of day to take a walk on a hill 
at the foot of which our barracks lay. In about 
three mornings after I had first seen her, I had, by 
an invitation to breakfast with me, got up two young 
men to join me in my walk; and our road ley by the 
house of her father and mother. It was hardly light, 
but she was out on the snow, scrubbing out a washing- 
tub. ‘That’s the girl for me,’ said I, when we had 
got out of her hearing. One of these young men 
came to England soon afterwards; and he, who 
keeps an inn in Yorkshire, came over to Preston, 
at the time of the election, to verify whether I were 
the same man, When he found that I Was, he 
appeared surprised ; but what was his surprise, when 
T told him that those tall young men, whom he saw 
around me, were the sons of that pretty little girl 
that he and I saw scrubbing out the washing-tub 
on the snow in New-Brunswick at day-break in the 
morning ! 
95. From the day that I first spoke to her, I 
never had a thought of her ever being the wife of 
any other man, more than I had a thought of her 
being transformed into a chest of drawers; and I 
formed my resolution at once, to marry her as soon 
as we could get permission, and to get out of the 
army as soon as I could. So that this matter was, 
at once, settled as firmly as if written in the book of 
fate, At the end of about six months, my regiment, 
and I along with it, were removed to FRepERIcKron, 
a distance of a hundred miles, wp the river of Sr. Joun ; 
and, which was worse, the artillery were expected to 
go off to England a year or two before our regiment! 
The artillery went, and she along with them; and 
now it was that I acted a part becoming a real and sensible lover. I was aware, that, when she got to 
that gay place Wootwicy, the house of her father

and mother, necessarily visited by numerous persons 
not the most select, might become unpleasant to her, 
and I did not like, besides, that she Should continue 
to work hard. 1 had saved a hundred and Jiffy 
imeas, the earnings of my early hours, in writing 
for the paymaster, the quartermaster, and others, in 
addition to the savings of my own pay. I sent her 
all my money, before she sailed; and wrote to her 
to beg of her, if she found her home uncomfortable, 
to hire a lodging with respectable people: and, at 
any rate, not to spare the money, by any means, but 
to buy herself good clothes, and to live without hard 
work, until I arrived in England; and I, in order to 
induce her to lay out the money, told her that I 
should get plenty more before I came home. 
96. As the malignity of the devil would have it, 
we were kept abroad two years longer than our time, 
Mr. Pirr (England not being so tame then as she is 
now) having knocked up a dust with Spain about 
Nootka Sound. Oh, how I cursed Nootka Sound, 
and poor bawling Pitt too, I am afraid! At the 
end of four years, however, home I came; landed at 
Portsmouth, and got my discharge from the army by 
the great kindness of poor Lorp Epwarp FrrzcEra.p, 
who was then the Major of my regiment. I found 
my little girl a servant of all work (and hard work 
it was), at five pounds a year, in the house of a 
Caprrain Brisac; and, without hardly saying a word 
about the matter, she put into my hands the whole 
of my hundred and fifty guineas unbroken !

miration of her conduct, and self-gratulation on this 
indubitable proof of the soundness of my own judg- 
ment, were now added to my love of her beautiful 
person. 
98. Now, I do not say that there are not many 
young women of this country who would, under 
similar circumstances, have acted as my wife did 
in this case; on the contrary, I hope, and do sin- 
cerely believe, that there are. But when her age is 
considered ; when we reflect, that she was living in 
a place crowded, literally crowded, with gaily-dressed 
and handsome young men, many of whom really far 
richer and in higher rank than I was, and scores of 
them ready to offer her their hand; when we reflect 
that she was living amongst young women who put 
upon their backs every shilling that they could come 
at; when we see her keeping the bag of gold un- 
touched, and working hard to provide herself with 
but mere necessary apparel, and doing this while she 
was passing from fourteen to eighteen years of age ; 
when we view the whole of the circumstances, we 
must say that here is an example, which, while it 
reflects honour on her sex, ought to have weight with 
every young woman whose eyes or ears this relation 
reach. 
99. If any young man imagine, that this great 
sobriety of conduct in young women must be accom- 
panied with seriousness approaching to gloom, he is, 
according to my experience and observation, very 
much deceived. The contrary is the fact; for I have 
found that as, amongst men, your jovial companions 
are, except over the bottle, the dullest and most 
insipid of souls ; so amongst women, the gay, rattling, 
and laughing, are, unless some party of pleasure, or 
something out of domestic life, is going on, generally 
in the dumps and blue-devils, Some stimulus is

always craved after by this description of women ; 
some sight to be seen, something to see or hear other 
than what is to be found at home, which, as it affords 
no incitement, nothing ‘to raise and keep up the 
spirits, is looked upon merely as a place to be at for 
want of a better; merely a place for eating and 
drinking, and the like; merely a biding place, whence 
to sally in search of enjoyments. A greater curse than 
a wife of this description, it would be somewhat 
difficult to find ; and, in your character of Lover, you 
are to provide against it. I hate a dull, melancholy, 
moping thing: I could not have existed in the same 
house with such a thing for a single month, The 
mopers are, too, all giggle at other times: the gaiety 
is for others, and the moping for the husband, to 
comfort him, happy man, when he is alone: plenty 
of smiles and of badinage for others, and for Em to 
participate with others ; but the moping is reserved 
exclusively for him. One hour she is capering about, 
as if rehearsing a jig; and, the next, sighing to the 
motion of a lazy needle, or weeping over a novel 
and this is called sentiment! Music, indeed! Give 
me a mother singing to her clean and fat and rosy 
baby, and making the house ring with her extra- 
vagant and hyperbolical encomiums on it. That is 
the music which is ‘the food of love ;’ and not the 
formal, pedantic noises, an affectation of skill in 
which is now-a-days the ruin of half the young 
couples in the middle rank of life. Let any man 
observe, as I so frequently have, with delight, the 
excessive fondness of the labouring ple for their 
children. Let him observe with what pride they 
dress them out on a Sunday, with means deducted 
from their own scanty meals. Let him observe the 
husband, who has toiled all the week like a horse, 
nursing the baby, while the wife is preparing the

bit of dimer. Let him observe them both. abstain- 
ing from. a sufficiency, lest the children should feel 
the pinchings of hunger. Let him observe, in short, 
the whole of their demeanour, the real mutual affec- 
tion, evinced, not in words, but in unequivocal deeds, 
Let him observe these things, and, having then cast 
a look at the lives of the great and wealthy, he will 
say, with me, that, when a man is choosing his partner 
for life, the dread of poverty ought to be cast to the 
winds, A. labourer’s cottage, on a Sunday; the 
husband or wife having a baby in arms, looking at 
two or three older ones playing between the flower- 
borders going from the wicket to the door, is, accord- 
ing to my taste, the most interesting object that eyes 
ever beheld; and, it is an object to be beheld in no 
country upon earth but England. In France, a 
labourer’s cottage means a shed with a dung-heap 
before the door ; and it means much about the same 
in America, where it is wholly inexcusable. In 
riding: once, about five years ago, from Petworth to 
Horsham, on a Sunday in the afternoon, I came: to 
a solitary cottage which stood at about twenty yards 
distance from the road. There was the wife with 
the baby in her arms, the husband teaching another 
child to walk, while four more were at play before 
them. I stopped and looked at them for some time, 
and then, turning my horse, rode up to the wicket, 
ing into talk by asking the distance to Horsham. 
found that the man worked chiefly in the woods, 
and that he was doing pretty well. The wife. 
was then only éenty-two, and the man only twenty-.. 
five. She was a pretty woman, even for Sussex, 
which, not excepting: Lancashire, contains the pret-- 
tiest women in- England. He was a very fine and 
stout young man, ‘Why,’ said I, ‘how many chil-. 
dren do you reckon: to have at last?* ‘I do not
-P-A-G-E-103
I} TO A LOVER 101 
care how many,’ said the man: ‘God never sends 
mouths without sending meat.’ ‘ Did you ever hear,’ 
said I, ‘of one Parson Mazruus?? ‘No, sir. ‘Why, 
if he were to hear of your works, he would be out- 
rageous ; for he wants an act of parliament ° pre- 
vent poor le from m: ing young, and from 
having such lots of children g oh! She brute !’ 
exclaimed the wife; while the husband laughed, 
thinking that I was joking. I asked the man 
whether he had ever had relief from the parish ; 
and upon his answering in the negative, I took out 
my purse, took from it enough to bait my horse 
at Horsham, and to clear my turnpikes to Worrn, 
whither I was going in order to stay awhile, and 
gave him all the rest. Now, is it not a shame, is it 
not a sin of all sins, that people like these should, 
by acts of the government, be reduced to such mi 
as to be induced to abandon their homes and their 
country, to seek, in a foreign land, the means of pre- 
venting themselves and their children from starving ? 
And this has been, and now is, actually the case 
with many such families in this same county of 
Sussex! 
100. An ardent-minded young man (who, by-the- 
by, will, as I am afraid, have been wearied by this 
rambling digression) may fear, that this great sobriety 
of conduct in a young woman, for which I have been 
so strenuously contending, argues a want of that 
warmth, which he naturally so much desires ; and, if 
my observation and experience warranted the enter- 
taining of this fear, I should say, had I to live my 
life over again, give me the warmth, and I will stand 
my chance as to the rest. But, this observation and 
this experience tell me the contrary; they tell me 
that levity is, ninety-nine times out of a hundred, 
the companion of a want of ardent feeling. Prosti-
-P-A-G-E-104
102 COBBETT’S ADVICE [Letter 
tutes never love, and, for the far greater part, never did. 
Their ion, which is more mere animal than any 
thing else, is easily gratified ; they, like rakes, change 
not only without pain, but with pleasure; that is to 
say, pleasure as great as they can enjoy. Women of 
light minds have seldom any ardent passion ; love is a 
mere name, unless confined to one object ; and young 
women, in whom levity of conduct is observable, wil 
not be thus restricte I do not, however, recom- 
mend a young man to be too severe in judging, where 
the conduct does not go beyond mere levity, and is 
not bordering on Loose conduct ; for something de- 
pends here upon constitution and animal spirits, and 
something also upon the manners of the country. 
That levity, which, in a French girl, I should not 
have thought a great deal of, would have frightened 
me away from an English or an American girl, When . 
I was in France, just after I was married, there 
happened to be amongst our acquaintance a gay, 
sprightly girl, of about seventeen. I was remon- 
strating with her, one day, on the facility with which 
she seemed to shift her smiles from object to object 5 
and she, stretching one arm out in an upward direc- 
tion, the other in a downward direction, raising her- 
self upon one foot, leaning her body on one side, and 
thus throwing herself into a flying attitude, answered 
my grave lecture by singing, in a very sweet voice 
(significantly bowing her head and smiling at the 
same time), the following lines from the vaudeville, 
in the play of Figaro: 
Si Pamour a des ailles ; 
N’est ce pas pour voltiger ? 
That is, if love has wings, is it not to flutter about 
with ? The wit, argument, and manner, all together, 
silenced me. She, after I left France, married a very

II] TO A LOVER 103 
worthy man, has had a large family, and has been, 
and is, a most excellent wife and mother. But 
that which does sometimes well in France, does not 
do here at all. Our manners are more grave: steadi- 
ness is the rule, and levity the exception. Love 
may voltige in France; but, in England, it cannot, 
with safety to the lover: and it is a truth which, 
I believe, no man of attentive observation will deny, 
that, as, in general, English wives are more warm in 
their conjugal attachments than those of France, so, 
with regard to individuals, that those English women 
who are the most light in their manners, and who 
are the least constant in their attachments, have the 
smallest portion of that warmth, that indescribable 
passion which God has given to human beings as 
the great counterbalance to all the sorrows and 
sufferings of life. 
101. Inpusrry. By industry, I do not mean 
merely laboriousness, merely labour or activity of 
body, for purposes of gain or of saving; for there 
may be industry amongst those who have more 
money than they know well what to do with: and 
there may be lazy ladies, as well as lazy farmers’ 
and tradesmen’s wives. There is no state of life in 
which industry in the wife is not necessary to the 
happiness and prosperity of the family, at the head 
of the household affairs of which she is placed. If 
she be lazy, there will be lazy servants, and, which is 
a great deal worse, children habitually lazy: every 
thing, however necessary to be done, will be put off 
to the last moment: then it will be done badly, and, 
in many cases, not at all: the dinner will be too late ; 
the journey or the visit will be tardy; inconveni- 
encies of all sorts will be continually arising: there 
will always be a heavy arrear of things unperformed ; 
and this, even amongst the most wealthy of all, is
-P-A-G-E-106
104 COBBETT’S ADVICE [Letter 
a great curse ; for, if they have no business im 
upon them by necessity, they make business for them- 
selves; life would be unbearable without it: and 
therefore a lazy woman must always be a curse, be 
her rank or station what it may. 
302. But, who is to tell whether a girl will make 
an industrious woman? How is the purblind lover 
especially, to be able to ascertain whether she, whose 
smiles and dimples and bewitching lips have half 
bereft him of his senses; how is he to be able to 
judge, from any thing that he can see, whether the 
beloved object will be industrious or lazy? Why, it 
is very difficult: it is a matter that reason has very 
little to do with; but there are, nevertheless, certain 
outward and visible signs, from which a man, not 
wholly deprived of the use of his reason, may form 
a pretty accurate judgment as to this matter. It 
was a story in Philadelphia, some years ago, that 
a-young man, who was courting one of three sisters, 
happened to be on a visit to her, when all the three 
were present, and when one said to the others, 
‘I wonder where our needle is Upon which he 
withdrew, as soon as was consistent with the rules 
of politeness, resolved never to think more of a girl 
who possessed a, needle only in partnership, and who, 
it appeared, was not too well informed as to the 
place where even that share was deposited. 
103. This was, to be sure, a very flagrant instance 
of a want of industry ; for, if the third part of the 
use of a needle satisfied her when single, it was 
reasonable to anticipate that marriage would banish 
that useful implement altogether. But such instances 
are seldom suffered to come in contact with the eyes 
and ears of the lover, to disguise all defects from 
whom is the great business, not only of the girl 
herself, but of her whole family. There are, how-
-P-A-G-E-107
I] TO A LOVER 105 
ever, certain outward signs, which, if attended to 
with care, will serve as pretty sure guides, And, 
first, if you find the tongue lazy, you may be nearly 
certain that the hands and feet are the same. By 
laziness of the tongue I do not mean silence; I do 
not mean an absence of talk, for that is, in most 
cases, very good ; but, I mean, a slow and soft utter- 
ance; a sort of sighing out of the words instead of 
speaking them ; a sort of letting the sounds fall out, 
as if the party were sick at stomach. The pronuncia- 
tion of an industrious person is generally quick, 
distinct, and the voice, if not strong, firm at the 
least. Not masculine; as feminine as possible; not 
a croak nor a bawl, but a quick, distinct, and sound 
voice, Nothing is much more disgusting than what 
the sensible country people call a maw-mouthed 
woman. A maw-mouthed man is bad enough: he is 
sure to be a lazy fellow: but, a woman of this 
description, in addition to her laziness, soon becomes 
the most disgusting of mates. In this whole world 
nothing is much more hateful than a female’s under 
jaw, lazily moving up and down, and letting out 
a long string of half-articulate sounds. It is im- 
possible for any man, who has any spirit in him, to 
love such a woman for any length of time. 
104, Look a little, also, at the labours of the 
teeth, for these correspond with those of the. other 
members of the body, and with the operations of the 
mind. ‘Quick at meals, quick at work,’ is a saying 
as old as the hills, in this, the most industrious 
nation upon earth; and never was there a truer 
saying. But fashion comes in here, and decides that 
you shall not be quick at meals; that you shall sit 
and be carrying on the affair of eating for an hour, 
or more. Good God! what have I not suffered on 
this account! However, though she must si as long
-P-A-G-E-108
106 COBBETT’S ADVICE [Letter 
as the rest, and though she must, join in the perform- 
ance (for it is a real performance) unto the end 
of the last scene, she cannot make her ¢ecth abandon 
their character. She may, and must, suffer the slice 
to linger on the plate, and must make the supply 
slow, in order to fill up the time; but when she does 
bite, she cannot well disguise what nature has taught 
her to do; and you may be assured, that if her jaws 
move in slow time, and if she rather squeeze than bite 
the food; if she so deal with it as to leave you in 
doubt as to whether she mean finally to admit or 
reject it; if she deal with it thus, set her down as 
being, in her very nature, incorrigibly lazy. Never 
mind the pieces of needle-work, the tambouring, the 
maps of the world made by her needle. Get to see 
her at work upon a mutton chop, or a bit of bread 
and cheese; and, if she deal quickly with these, you 
have a pretty good security for that activity, that 
stirring industry, without which a wife is a len 
instead of being a help. And, as to love, it cannot 
live for more than a month or two (in the breast of 
a man of spirit) towards a lazy woman. 
105. Another mark of industry is, a quick step, 
and a somewhat heavy tread, showing that the foot 
comes down with a hearty good will ; and if the body 
lean a little forward, and the eyes keep steadily in 
the same direction, while the feet are going, so much 
the better, for these discover earnestness to arrive at 
the intended point. a do not like, and I never liked, 
your sauntering, soft-stepping girls, who move as if 
they were perfectly indi ene Ste the result ; and, as to the love part of the story, whoever expects ardent and lasting affection from one of these saunter- 
ing girls, will, when too late, find his mistake: the character runs the same all the way through ; and no man ever yet saw asauntering girl, who di not, when
-P-A-G-E-109
I] TO A LOVER 107 
married, make a mawkish wife, and a cold-hearted 
mother; cared very little for either by husband or 
children; and, of course, having no store of those 
blessings which are the natural resources to apply to — 
in sickness and in old age. 
106. Early-rising is another mark of industry ; 
and though, in the higher situations of life, it may 
be of no importance in a mere pecuniary point of 
view, it is, even there, of importance in other 
respects for it is, I should imagine, pretty difficult 
to keep love alive towards a woman who never sees 
the dew, never beholds the rising sun, and who 
constantly comes directly from a reeking bed to 
the breakfast table, and there chews about, without 
appetite, the choicest morsels of human food. A man 
might, perhaps, endure this for a month or two, 
without being disgusted; but that is ample allow- 
ance of time. And, as to people in the middle rank 
of life, where a living and a provision for children is 
to be sought by labour of some sort or other, late 
rising in the wife is certain ruin; and, never was 
there yet an early-rising wife, who had been a late- 
rising girl. If brought up to late rising, she will 
like it; it will be her habit; she will, when married, 
never want excuses for indulging in the habit; at 
first she will be indulged without bounds; to make 
a change afterwards will be difficult; it will be 
deemed a wrong done to her; she will ascribe it to 
diminished affection; a quarrel must ensue, or, the 
husband must submit to be ruined, or, at the very 
least, to see half the fruit of his labour snored and 
lounged aay. And, is this being rigid? Is it bei 
harsh ; is it being hard upon women? Is it the off- 
spring of the frigid severity of age? It is none.of 
ese: it arises from an ardent desire to promote the 
happiness, and to add to the natural, legitimate, and
-P-A-G-E-110
108 COBBETT’S ADVICE {Letter 
salutary influence, of the female sex. The tendency 
of this advice is to promote the preservation of their 
health ; to prolong the duration of their beauty; to 
cause them to be beloved to the last day of their 
lives; and to give them, during the whole of those 
lives, weight and consequence, of which laziness would 
render them wholly unworthy. 
107. Frucauiry. This means the contrary of 
extravagance. It does not mean stinginess ; it does 
not mean a pinching of the belly, nor a strippin 
of the back; but it means an abstaining from al 
unnecessary expenditure, and all unnecessary use, of 
goods of any and of every sort; and a quality of 
Brest importance it is, whether the rank in life be 
igh or low. Some people are, indeed, so rich, they 
have such an overabundance of money and goods, 
that how to get rid of them would, to a looker-on, 
seem to be their only difficulty. But while the 
inconvenience of even these immense masses is not 
too great to be overcome by a really extravagant 
woman, who jumps with joy at a basket of straw- 
berries at a guinea an ounce, and who would not 
give a straw for green peas later in the year than 
January ; while such a dame would lighten the bags 
of a loan-monger, or shorten the rent-roll of half-a- 
dozen peerages amalgamated into one possession, she 
would, with very little study and application of her 
talent, send a nobleman of ordinary estate to the 
r-house or the Pension list, which last may be 
justly regarded as the poor-book of the aristocracy. 
How many noblemen and gentlemen, of fine estates, 
have been ruined and degraded by the extravagance of their wives! More frequently by their own 
extravagance, perhaps; but, in numerous instances, by that of those whose duty it is to assist in uphold- 
ing their stations by husbanding their fortunes.
-P-A-G-E-111
Ill] TO A LOVER 109 
108. If this be the case amongst the opulent, who 
have estates to draw upon, what must be the conse- 
quences of a want of frugality in the middle and 
lower ranks of life? Here it must be fatal, and 
especially amongst that description of persons whose 
wives have, in many cases, the receiving as well as 
the expending of money. In such a case, there 
wants nothing but extravagance in the wife to make 
ruin as sure as the arrival of old age. To obtain 
security against this is very difficult ; yet, if the lover 
be not quite blind, he may easily discover a propensity 
towards extravagance. The object of his addresses 
will, nine times out of ten, not be the manager of 
a house; but she must have her dress, and other 
little matters under her control. If she be costly in 
these ; if, in these, she step above her rank, or even 
to the top of it; if she purchase all she is able to 
purchase, and prefer the showy to the useful, the gay 
and the fragile to the less sightly and more durable, 
_he may be sure that the disposition will cling to her 
through life. If he perceive in her a taste for costly 
food, costly furniture, costly amusements ; if he find 
her love of gratification to be bounded only by her 
want of means; if he find her full of admiration of 
the trappings of the rich, and of desire to be able to 
imitate them, he may be pretty sure that she will not 
spare his purse, when once she gets her hand into it ; 
and, therefore, if he can bid adieu to her charms, the 
sooner he does it the better. 
109, The outward and visible and vulgar signs of 
extravagance are rings, broaches, bracelets, buckles, 
necklaces, diamonds (real or mock), and, in short, all 
the hard-ware which women put upon their persons. 
These things may be proper enough in palaces, or in 
scenes resembling palaces: but, when they make their 
appearance: amongst people in the middle rank of

life, where, after all, they only serve to show that 
poverty in the parties which they wish to disguise ; 
when the nasty, mean, tawdry things make their 
appearance in this rank of life, they are the sure 
indications of a disposition that will always be 
straining at what it can never attain. To m 
a girl of this disposition is really self-destruction. 
You never can have either property or peace. Earn 
her a horse to ride, she will want a gig: earn the 
ig, she will want a chariot: get her that, she will 
long for a coach and four: and, from stage to stage, 
she will torment you to the end of her or your days ; 
for, still there will be somebody with a finer equipage 
than you can give her; and, as long as this is ‘the 
ease, you will never have rest. Reason would tell 
her, that she could never be at the top; that she 
must stop at some point short of that; and that, 
therefore, all expenses in the rivalship are so much 
thrown away. But, reason and broaches and brace- 
lets do not go in company: the girl who has not the 
sense to perceive that her person is disfigured, and 
not beautified, by parcels of brass and tin (for the 
are generally little Better) and other hard-ware, stuck 
about her body; the girl that is so foolish as not to 
perceive, that, when silks and cottons and cambrics, 
in their neatest form, have done their best, nothing 
more is to be done; the girl that cannot perceive 
this is too great a fool to be trusted with the purse of any man. 
110. Creantnvess. This is a capital ingredient ; for there never yet was, and there never will be, love of long duration, sincere and ardent love, in any 
man, towards a ‘filthy mate.’ I mean any man in or in those parts of America where the people have descended from the English. I do not say, that there are not men enough, even in England,
-P-A-G-E-113
TIT] TO A LOVER - 11 
to live peaceably and even contentedly, with dirty, 
sluttish women; for, there are some who seem to 
like the filth well enough. But what I contend for 
is this: that there never can exist, for any length of 
time, ardent affection in any man towards a woman 
who is filthy either in her person, or in her house 
affairs. Men may be careless as to their own persons ; 
they may, from the nature of their business, or from 
their want of time to adhere to neatness in dress, 
be slovenly in their own dress and habits; but, 
they do not relish this in their wives, who must 
still have charms; and charms and filth do not go 
together. 
111. tt is not dress that the husband wants to be 
perpetual: it is not finery; but cleanliness in ev 
Pine. The French women dress enough, especially 
when they sally forth. My excellent neighbour, 
Mr. Joun Trepwext, of Long Island, used to say, 
that the French were ‘pigs in the parlour, and 
peacocks on the promenade;’ an alliteration which 
*Canwine’s seLF’ might have envied! This occa- 
sional cleanliness is not the thing that an English 
or an American husband wants: he wants it always ; 
indoors as well as out; by night as well as by day ; 
on the floor as well as on the table; and, however he 
may grumble about the ‘fuss’ and the ‘expense’ of 
it, he would grumble more if he had it not. I once 
saw a picture representing the amusements of Portu- 
guese Lovers; that is to say, three or four young 
men, dressed in gold or silver laced clothes, each 
having a young girl, dressed like a princess, and 
affectionately engaged in hunting down and killing 
the vermin in his head! This was, perhaps, an 
eraggeration ; but that it should have had the 
shadow of foundation, was enough to fill me with 
contempt for the whole nation. :

a clean skin, ran English girl will hardly ee 
lover see the stale dirt between her fingers, as I have 
many times seen it between those of French women, 
and even ladies, of all ages. An English girl will 
have her face clean, to be sure, if there be soap and 
water within her reach; but, get a glance, just a 
glance, at her poll, if you have any doubt upon the 
subject; and, if you find there, or behind the ears, 
what the Yorkshire people call grime, the sooner you 
cease your visits the better. I hope, now, that no 
young woman will be offended at this, and think me 
too severe on her sex. J am only saying, Iam only 
telling the women, that which all men think ; and, it 
is a decided advantage to them to be fully informed of 
our thoughts on the subject. If any one, who shall 
read this, find, upon self-examination, that she is 
defective in this respect, there is plenty of time for 
correcting the defect. . 
113. In the dress you can, amongst rich people, 
find little whereon to form a judgment as to cleanli- 
ness, because they have not only the dress prepared 
for them, but put upon them into the bargain. But, 
in the middle rank of life, the dress is a good criterion 
in two respects: first, as to its colour; for, if the 
white be a sort of yellow, cleanly hands would have 
been at work to prevent that. A white-yellow cravat, 
or shirt, on a man, speaks, at once, the character of 
his wife; and, be you assured, that she will not take 
with your dress pains which she has never taken with 
her own. ‘Then, the manner of putting on the dress 
is no bad foundation for’ judging. If it be careless, 
slovenly, if it.do not fit properly, no matter for its 
mean quality: mean as it may be, it may be neatly 
_ and trimly put on; and, if it be not, take care of 
yourself; for, as you will soon find to your cost,
-P-A-G-E-115
NY] TO A LOVER 113 
a sloven in one thing is a sloven in all things. The 
country-people judge greatly from the state of the 
covering of the ancies and, if that be not clean and 
tight, they conclude, that all out of sight is not what 
it ought to be. Look at the shoes! If they be 
trodden on one side, loose on the foot, or run down 
at the heel, it is a very bad sign; and, as to slip- 
shod, though at coming down in the morning and 
even before daylight, make up your mind to a rope, 
rather than to live with a slip shod wife. 
114, Oh! how much do women lose by inattention 
to these matters! Men, in general, say nothing 
about it to their wives; but they think about it; 
they envy their luckier neighbours; and in numerous 
cases, consequences the most serious arise from this 
apparently trifling cause. Beauty is valuable; it is 
one of the ties, and a strong tie too; that, however, 
cannot last to old age; but, the charm of cleanliness 
never ends but with life itself. I dismiss this part 
of my subject with a quotation from my ‘ Yxar’s 
Rzsipence inv America,’ containing words which I 
venture to recommend to every young woman to 
engrave on her heart: ‘The sweetest flowers, when 
they become putrid, stink the most; and a nasty 
woman is the nastiest thing in nature.’ 
115, Kxow.epce or pomestic Arvairs. Without 
more or less of this knowledge, a lady, even the wife 
of a peer, is but a poorish thing. It was the fashion, 
in former times, for ladies to understand a great deal 
about these affairs, and it would be very hard to 
make me believe that this did not tend to promote 
the interests and honour of their husbands. The 
affairs of a great family never can be well managed, 
if left wholly to hirelings ; and there are many parts 
of these affairs in which it would be unseemly for the 
husband to meddle. Surely, no lady can be too high

in rank to make it proper for her to be well ac- 
quainted with the characters and general demeanour 
of all the female servants. To receive and give them 
characters is too much to be left to a servant, how- 
ever good, and of service however long. Much of 
the ease and happiness of the great and rich must 
depend on the character of those by whom they are 
served : they live under the same roof with them ; 
they are frequently the children of their tenants, or 
poorer neigh! ours; the conduct of their whole lives 
must be influenced by the examples and precepts 
which they here imbibe; and when ladies consider 
how much more weight there must be in one word 
from them than in ten thousand words from a person 
who, call her what you like, is still a fellow-servant, 
it does appear strange that they should forego the 
performance of this at once important and pleasing 
part of their duty. It was from the mansions of 
noblemen and gentlemen, and not from boarding- 
schools, that farmers and tradesmen formerly took 
their wives; and though these days are gone, with 
little chance of returning, there is still something left 
for ladies to do in checking that torrent of immorality 
which is now crowding the streets with prostitutes 
and cramming the jails with thieves. 
116. I am, however, addressing myself, in this work, 
to persons in the middle rank of life; and here a 
knowledge of domestic affairs is so necessary in every 
wife, that the lover ought to have it continually in 
his eye. Not only a knowledge of these affairs ; not 
only to know how things oug t to be done, but how to do them; not only to know what ingredients ought to be put into a pie or a pudding, but to be able to make the pie or the pudding. Young people, when they come together, ought not, unless they have for- tunes, or are in a great way of business, to think
-P-A-G-E-117
Ti} TO A LOVER 115 
about servants! Servants for what! ‘To help them 
to eat and drink and sleep? When children come, 
there must be some help in a farmer's or trades- 
man’s house ; but until then, what call for a servant 
in a house, the master of which has to earn every 
mouthful that is consumed ? 
117. I shall, when I come to address myself to the 
husband, have much more to say upon this subject of 
keeping servants ; but, what the lover, if he be not quite 
blind, has to look to, is, that his intended wife know 
how to do the work of a house, unless he have fortune 
sufficient to keep her like alady. ‘Eating and drink- 
ing,’ as I observe in Corracz Economy, came three 
times every day; they must come; and, however 
little we may, in the days of our health and vigour, 
care about choice food and about cookery, we very 
soon get tired of heavy or burnt bread and of spoiled 
joints of meat: we bear them for a time, or for two, 
perhaps; but, about the third time, we lament in- 
wardly ; about the fifth time, it must be an extra- 
ordinary honey-moon that will keep us from com- 
laining : if the like continue for a month or two, we 
in to repent ; and then adieu to all our anticipated 
delights. “We discover, when it is too late, that we 
have not got a help-mate, but a burden; and, the 
fire of love being damped, the unfortunately educated 
creature, whose parents are more to blame than she 
is, is, unless she resolve to learn her duty, doomed to 
lead a life very nearly approaching to that of misery ; 
for, however considerate the husband, he never can 
esteem her as he would have done, had she been skilled 
and able in domestic affairs. 
118. The mere manual performance of domestic 
labours is not, indeed, absolutely necessary in 
female head of the family of professional men, such 
as lawyers, doctors, and parsons ; but, even here, and 
1

also in the case of great merchants and of gentlemen 
living on their fortunes, surely the head of the house- 
hold ought to be able to give directions as to the 
purchasing of meat, salting meat, making bread, 
making preserves of all sorts, and ought to see the 
things done, or that they be done. She ought to 
take care that food be well cooked, drink properly 
prepared and kept; that there be always a sufficient 
supp ; that there be good living without waste; 
and that, in her department, nothing shall be seen 
inconsistent with the rank, station, and character of 
her husband, who, if he have a skilful and industrious 
wife, will, unless he be of a singularly foolish turn, 
gladly leave all these things to her absolute dominion, 
controlled only by the extent of the whole expendi- 
ture, of which he must be the best, and, indeed, the 
sole, ju 
119. But, in a farmer’s or  tradesman’s family, the 
manual performance is absolutely necessary, whether 
there be servants or not. No one knows how to teach 
another so well as one who has done, and can do, the 
thing himself. It was said of a famous French com- 
mander, that, in attacking an enemy, he did not say 
to his men ‘go on,’ but ‘come on;’ and, whoever 
have ‘well observed the movements of servants, must 
know what a prodigious difference there is in the effect 
of the words, ge and come. A very good rule would 
be, to have nothing to eat, in a farmer’s or tradesman’s 
house, that the mistress did not know how to prepare 
and to cook ;. no pudding, tart, pie or cake, that she 
did not.know how to e. Never fear the toil to her : exercise is good for health ; and without health 
there is no beauty ; a sick beauty may excite pity, but pity is a short-lived passion. Besides, what is the labour in such a case? And how many thousands 
of ladies, who loll away the day, would give half their
-P-A-G-E-119
Ti) . .TO A LOVER 7 
fortunes for that sound sleep which the stirring 
house-wife seldom fails to enjoy. 
120. Yet, if a young farmer or tradesman marry a 
girl, who has been brought up to play music, to what 
is called draw, to sing, to waste paper, pen and ink, 
in writing long and half romantic letters, and to see 
shows, and plays, and read novels; if a young man 
do marry such an unfortunate young creature, let him 
bear the consequences with temper; let him be just ; 
and. justice wil teach him to treat her with great 
indulgence ; to endeavour to cause her to learn her 
business as a wife; to be patient with her ; to reflect 
that he has taken her, being apprised of her inability ; 
to bear in mind, that he was, or seemed to be, pleased 
with her showy and useless acquirements; and that, 
when the gratification of his passion has been accom- 
plished, he is unjust and cruel and unmanly, if he 
turn round upon her, and accuse her of a want of that 
knowledge, which he well knew that she did not 
possess. 
121. For my part, I do not know, nor can I form 
an idea of, a more unfortunate being than a girl with 
a mere boarding-school education, and without a 
fortune to enable her to keep a servant, when married. 
Of what wse are her accomplishments? Of what use 
her music, her drawing, and her romantic epistles? 
If she be good in her nature, the first little faint er 
of her first baby drives all the tunes and all the land- 
scapes and all the Clarissa Harlowes out of her head 
forever. I once saw a very striking instance of this 
sort. It was a climb-over-the-wall match, and I gave 
the bride away, at St. Margaret’s Church, West- 
minster, the pair being as handsome a pair as ever I 
saw in my life. Beauty, however, though in double 
quantity, would not pay the baker and butcher; and, 
after an absence of little better than a year, 1 found
-P-A-G-E-120
118 COBBETT’S ADVICE [Letter 
the husband in prison for debt; but I there found 
also his wife, with her baby, and she, who had never, 
before her marriage, known what it was to get water 
to wash her own hands, and whose talk was all about 
music, and the like, was now the cheerful sustainer of 
her husband, and the most affectionate of mothers. 
All the music and all the drawing, and all the plays 
and romances were gone to the winds! The husband 
and baby had fairly supplanted them; and even this 
prison-scene was a blessing, as it gave her, at this 
early stage, an opportunity of proving her devotion 
to her husband, Pho, though I have not seen him for 
about fifteen years, he being in a part of America 
which I could not reach when last there, has, I am 
sure, amply repaid her for that devotion. They 
have now a numerous family (not less than twelve 
children, I believe), and she is, I am told, a most 
excellent and able mistress of a res ble house. 
122. But, this is a rare instance: the husband, like 
his countrymen in general, was at once brave, humane, 
gentle, and considerate, and the love was so sincere 
and ardent, on both sides, that it made losses and 
sufferings appear as nothing. When I, in a sort of 
half-whisper, asked Mrs. Dickens where her piano 
was, she smiled, and turned her face towards her 
baby, that was sitting on her knee ; as much as to say, 
‘This little fellow has beaten the piano;’ and, if 
what I am now writing should ever have the honour 
to be read by her, let it be the bearer of a renewed 
expression of my admiration of her conduct, and of 
that regard for her kind and sensible husband, which 
time and distance have not in the least diminished, 
and which will be an inmate of my heart until it 
shall cease to beat. 
123, The like of this is, however, not to be ex- 
pected: no man ought to think that he has even a
-P-A-G-E-121
I] TO A LOVER ng 
chance of it: besides, the husband was, in this case, 
a man of learning and of great natural ability: he 
has not had to get his bread by farming or trade; 
and, in all probability, his wife has had the leisure to 
practise those acquirements which she possessed at 
the time of her marriage. But, can this be the case 
-with the farmer or the tradesman’s wife? She has 
to help to earn a provision for her children ; or, at 
the least, to help to earn a store for sickness or old 
age. She, therefore, ought to be qualified to begin, 
at once, to assist her husband in his earnings: the 
way in which she can most. efficiently assist, is by 
taking care of his property 3; by expending his money 
to the greatest advantage ; by wasting nothing ; by 
making the table sufficiently abundant with the least 
expense. And how is she to do these things, unless 
she have been brought up to understand domestic 
affairs? How is she to do these things, if she have 
been taught to think these matters beneath her 
study? How is any man to expect her to do these 
things, if she have been so bred up as to make her 
habitually look upon them as worthy the attention 
of none but low and ignorant women? 
124, Ignorant, indeed! Ignorance consists in a 
want of knowledge of those things which your call- 
ing or state of life naturally supposes you to under- 
stand. A ploughman is not an ignorant man because 
he does not know how to read: if he knows how to 
plough, he is not to be called an ignorant man; but, 
a wife may be justly called an ignorant woman, if she 
does not know how to provide a dinner for her hus- 
band. It is cold comfort for a hungry man, to tell 
him how delightfully his wife plays and sings: lovers 
may live on very aérial diet; but husbands stand in 
need of the solids; and young women may take my 
word for it, that a constantly clean board, well cooked
-P-A-G-E-122

victuals, a house in order, and a cheerful fire, will do 
more in preserving a husband’s heart, than all the 
‘ accomplishments, taught in all the ‘ establishments’ 
in the world. 
125. Goon Temper. This is a very difficult thing 
to ascertain beforehand. Smiles are so cheap ; they 
are so easily put on for the occasion ; and, besides, 
the frowns are, according to the lover’s whim, inter- 
preted into the contrary. By ‘good temper, I do 
not mean easy temper, a serenity which nothing dis- 
turbs, for that is a mark of laziness. Sudkiness, if 
you be not too blind to perceive it, is a temper to be 
avoided by all means. A sulky man is bad enough; 
what, then, must be a sulky woman, and that woman 
a wife; a constant inmate, a companion day and 
night! Only think of the delight of sitting at the 
same table, and sleeping in the same bed, for a week, 
and not exchange a word all the while! Very bad 
to be scolding for such a length of time ; but this is 
far better than the sulks. If you have your eyes, 
and look sharp, you will discover symptoms of this, if 
it unhappily exist. She will, at some time or other, 
show it towards some one or other of the family; or, 
perhaps, towards yourself; and you may be quite 
sure that, in this respect, marriage will not mend 
her. Sulkiness arises from capricious displeasure, 
displeasure not founded in reason. The party takes 
offence unjustifiably ; is unable to frame a complaint, 
and therefore expresses displeasure by silence. The 
remedy for sulkiness is, to suffer it to take its full 
swing ; but it is better not to have the disease in your house ; and to be married to it is little short of madness. 
126. Querulousness isa great fault. No man, and, especially, no woman, likes to hear eternal plaintive- 
ness, That she complain, and roundly complain, of
-P-A-G-E-123
IN] TO A LOVER 121 
your want of punctuality, of your coolness, of your 
neglect, of your liking the company of others: these 
are all very well, more especially as they are fre- 
quently but too just. But an everlasting complain- 
ing, without rhyme or reason, is a bad sign. It 
shows want of patience, and, indeed, want of sense. 
But, the contrary of this, a cold indifference, is still 
worse. ‘When will you come in? You can 
never find time to come here. You like any company 
better than mine.’ These, when groundless, are very 
teasing, and demonstrate a disposition too full of 
anxiousness; but, from a girl who always receives you 
with the same civil smile, lets you, at your own good 
pleasure, depart with the same; and who, when you 
take her by the hand, holds her cold fingers as 
straight as sticks, I say (or should if I were young), 
God, in his mercy, preserve me ! 
127. Pertinacity is a very bad thing in anybody, 
and especially in a young woman; and it is sure to 
increase in force with the age of the party. To have 
the last word is a poor triumph; but with some 
people it is a species of disease of the mind. In a 
wife it must be extremely troublesome; and, if you 
find an ounce of it in the maid, it will become a pound 
in the wife. An eternal disputer is a most disagree- 
able companion; and where young women thrust 
their say into conversations carried on by older per- 
sons, give their opinions in a positive manner, and 
court a contest of the tongue, those must be very 
bold men who will encounter them as wives. 
128. Still, of all the faults as to temper, your 
melancholy ladies have the worst, unless you have the 
same mental disease. Most wives are, at times, misery- 
makers ; but these carry it on as a regular ‘trade. 
They are always unhappy about something, either 
past, present, or to come. Both arms full of children
-P-A-G-E-124
122 COBBETT’S ADVICE {Letter 
is a pretty efficient remedy in most cases ; but, if the 
ingredients be wanting, a little want, a little real 
trouble, a, little genuine affliction must, if you would 
effect a cure, be resorted to. But, this is very painful 
to a man of any feeling ; and, therefore, the best way 
is to avoid a connexion, which is to give you a life of 
wailing and sighs. 
129. Beavry. Though I have reserved this to 
the last of the things to be desired in a wife, I by no 
means think it the last in point of importance. The 
less favoured part of the sex say, that ‘beauty is but 
skin-deep ;’ and. this is very true; but, it is very agree- 
able, though, for all that. Pictures are only paint- 
deep, or pencil-deep ; but we admire them, neverthe- 
less. ‘Handsome is that handsome does,’ used to 
say to me an old man, who had marked me out for 
his not over handsome daughter. ‘Please your eye 
and plague your heart’ is an adage that want of 
beauty invented, I dare say, more than a thousand 
years ago. ‘These adages would say, if they had but. 
the courage, that beauty is inconsistent with chas- 
tity, with sobriety of conduct, and with all the female 
virtues. The argument is, that beauty exposes the 
r to greater temptation than women not 
uutiful are exposed to; and that, therefore, their 
fall is more probable. Let us see a little how this 
matter stands. 
130, It is certainly true, that pretty girls will have 
more, and more ardent, admirers than ugly ones; 
but, as to the temptation when in their unmarried 
state, there are few so ver ugly as to be exposed to no temptation at all; and, which is the most likely to resist ; she who has a choice of lovers, or she who if she let the occasion slip may never have it again? Which of the two is most likely to set a high value upon her reputation, she whom all beholders admire,
-P-A-G-E-125
Ill] TO A LOVER 123 
or she who is admired, at best, by mere chance? 
And as to women in the married state, this argu- 
ment assumes, that, when they fall, it is from their 
own vicious disposition ; when the fact is, that, if you 
search the annals of conjugal infidelity, you will find, 
‘that, nine times out of ten, the fault is in the husband. 
It is his neglect, his flagrant disregard, his frosty 
indifference, his foul example; it is to these that, 
nine times out of ten, he owes the infidelity of his 
wife ; and, if I were to say ninety-nine times out of 
a hundred, the facts, if verified, would, I am certain, 
bear meout. And whence this neglect, this disregard, 
this frosty indifference ; whence this foul example? 
Because it is easy, in so many cases, to find some woman 
more beautiful than the wife. This is no justification 
for the husband to plead; for he has, with his eyes 
open, made a solemn contract: if he have not beauty 
enough to please him, he should have sought it in 
some other woman: if, as is frequently the case, he 
have preferred rank or money to beauty, he is an 
unprincipled man, if he do any thing to make her 
unhappy who has brought him the rank or the money. 
At any rate, as conjugal infidelity is, in so many 
cases; as it is generally caused the want of 
affection and due attention in the husband, it follows, 
of course, that it must more frequently happen in 
the case of ugly than in that of handsome women. 
181. In point of dress, nothing need be said to 
convince any reasonable man, that beautiful women 
will be less expensive in this respect than women of 
a contrary description. Experience teaches us, that 
ugly women are always the most studious about their 
dress; and, if we had never observed upon the 
subject, reason would tell us, that it must be so. 
Few women are handsome without knowing it; and 
if they know that their features naturally attract
-P-A-G-E-126
124 COBBETT’S ADVICE [Letter 
admiration, will they desire to draw it off, and to 
fix it on lace and silks and jewels? 
132. As to manners and temper there are certainly some handsome women who are conceited and arro- 
gant; but, as they have all the best reasons in the 
world for being pleased with themselves, they afford 
you the best chance of general good humour ; and 
this good humour is a very valuable commodity in 
the married state. Some that are called handsome, 
and that are such at the first glance, are dull, inani- 
mate things, that might as well have been made of 
wax, or of wood. But, the truth is, that this is not 
beauty, for this is not to be found only in the form 
of the features, but in the movements of them also. 
Besides, here nature is very impartial; for she gives 
animation promiscuously to the handsome as well as 
to the ugly; and the want of this in the former is 
surely as bearable as in the latter. 
138. But, the great use of female beauty, the 
great practical advantage of it is, that it naturally 
and unavoidably tends to keep the husband in good 
humour with himself, to make him, to use the dealer's 
phrase, pleased with his bargain. When old age 
approaches, and the parties have become endeared 
to each other by a long series of joint cares and 
interests, and when children have come and bound 
them together by the strongest ties that nature has 
in store ; at this age the features and the person are 
of less consequence; but, in the young days of 
matrimony, when the roving eye of the bachelor is 
scarcely become steady in the head of the husband, 
it is dangerous for him to see, every time he stirs 
out, a face more captivating than that of the person 
to whom he is bound for life. Beauty is, in some 
degree, a matter of taste: what one man admires, another does not; and it is fortunate for us that it
-P-A-G-E-127
TY] TO A LOVER 125 
is thus. But still there are certain things that all 
men admire; and a husband is always pleased when 
he perceives that a portion, at least, of these things 
are in his own possession: he takes this possession as 
a compliment to himself: there must, he will think 
the world will believe, have been some merit in him, 
some charm, seen or unseen, to have caused him to 
be blessed with the acquisition. 
134, And then there arise so many things, sickness, 
misfortune in business, losses, many many things, 
wholly unexpected ; and, there are so many circum- 
stances, perfectly nameless, to communicate to the 
new-married man the fact, that it is not a real angel 
of whom he has got the possession; there are so 
many things of this sort, so many and such powerful 
dampers of the passions, and so many incentives to 
cool reflection; that it requires something, and a 
good deal too, to keep the husband in countenance 
in this his altered and enlightened state. The 
passion of women does not cool so soon: the lamp of 
their love burns more steadily, and even brightens as 
it burns: and, there is, the young man may be 
assured, a vast difference in the effect of the fondness 
of a pretty woman and that of one of a different 
description ; and, let reason and philosophy say what 
they will, 2 man will come down stairs of a morning 
better pleased after seeing the former, than he 
would after seeing the latter, in her night-cap. 
135. To be sure, when a man has, from whatever 
inducement, once married a woman, he is unjust and 
cruel if he even slight her on account of her want of 
beauty, and, if he treat her harshly, on this account, 
he is a brute. But, it requires a greater degree of 
reflection and consideration than falls to the lot of 
men in general to make them act with justice in such 
a case; and, therefore, the best way is to guard, if you
-P-A-G-E-128
126 COBBETT’S ADVICE [Letter 
can, against the temptation to commit such injustice, 
which is to be done in no other way, than by not 
marrying any one that you do not think handsome. 
136. I must not conclude this address to THE 
Lover without something on the subject of seduction 
and inconstancy. In, perhaps, nineteen cases out of 
twenty, there is, in the unfortunate cases of illicit 
gratification, no seduction at all, the passion, the 
absence of virtue, and the crime, being all mutual. 
But, there are other cases of a very different descrip- 
tion; and where a man goes coolly and deliberately 
to work, first to gain and rivet the affections of 
a young girl, then to take advantage of those 
affections to accomplish that which he knows must 
be her ruin, and plunge her into misery for life; 
when a man does this merely for the sake of a 
momentary gratification, he must be either a selfish 
and unfeeling brute, unworthy of the name of man, 
or he must have a heart little inferior, in point of 
obduracy, to that of the murderer. Let young 
women, however, be aware; let them be well aware, 
that few, indeed, are the cases in which this apology 
can possibly avail them. Their character is not 
solely theirs, but belongs, in part, to their famil 
and kindred. They may, in the case contemplated, 
be objects of compassion with the world ; but what 
contrition, what repentance, what remorse, what 
that even the tenderest benevolence can suggest, is 
to heal the wounded hearts of humbled, disgraced, 
but still affectionate, parents, brethren and sisters ? 187. As to constancy in Lovers, though I do not 
approve of the saying, ‘ At lovers’ lies Jove laughs ;” yet, when people are young, one object may sup- plant another in their affections, not only without criminality in the party experiencing the change, but, without blame; and it. is honest, and even
-P-A-G-E-129
III] TO A LOVER 127 
humane, to act upon the change; because it 
would be both foolish and cruel to marry one girl 
while you liked another better: and the same holds 
good with regard to the other sex. Even when 
marriage has been promised, and that, too, in the 
most solemn manner, it is better for both parties to 
break off, than to be coupled together with the 
reluctant assent of either ; and I have always thought, 
that actions for damages, on this score, if brought by 
the girl, show a want of delicacy as well as of spirit ; 
and, if brought by the man, excessive meanness. 
Some damage may, indeed, have been done to the 
complaining party; but no damage equal to what 
that party would have sustained from a marriage, to 
which the other party would have yielded by a sort 
of compulsion, producing to almost a certainty what 
Hogarth, in his Marriage a la Mode, most aptly typi- 
fies by two curs, of different sexes, fastened together 
by what sportsmen call couples, pulling different ways, 
and snarling and barking and foaming like furies. 
188, But when promises have been made to a 
young woman; when they have been relied on for 
any considerable time; when it is manifest that her 
peace and happiness, and, perhaps, her life, depend 
upon their fulfilment ; when things have been carried 
to this length, the change in the Lover ought to be 
announced in the manner most likely to make the 
disappointment as supportable as the case will admit 
of; for, though it is better to break the promise 
than to marry one while you like another better ; 
though it is better for both parties, you have no 
right to break the heart of her who has, and that, 
too, with your accordance, and, indeed, at your 
instigation, or, at least, by your encouragement, con- 
fided it to your fidelity. You cannot help your 
change of affections ; but you can help making the
-P-A-G-E-130
128 COBBETT’S ADVICE [Letter 
transfer in such a way as to cause the destruction, or 
even probable destruction, nay, if it were but the 
deep misery, of her, to gain whose heart you had 
ledged your own. You ought to proceed by slow 
legrees; you ought to call time to your aid in 
executing the painful task ; you ought scrupulously 
to avoid every thing calculated to aggravate the 
sufferings of the disconsolate party. . 
139. A striking, a monstrous, instance of conduct 
the contrary of this has recently been placed upon 
the melancholy records of the Coroner of Middlesex ; 
which have informed an indignant public, that a 
young man, having first secured the affections of 
a virtuous young woman, next promised her marriage, 
then caused the banns to be published, and then, on 
the very day appointed for the performance of the 
ceremony, married another woman, in the same 
church; and this, too, without, as he avowed, any 
rovocation, and without the smallest intimation or 
int of his intention to the disappointed party, who, 
unable to support existence under a blow so cruel, 
put an end to that existence by the most deadly and 
the swiftest poison, If any thing could wipe from 
our country the stain of having given birth to a 
monster so barbarous as this, it would be the 
abhorrence of him which the jury expressed; and 
which, from every tongue, he ought to hear to the 
last moment of his life. 
140. Nor has a man any right to sport with the 
affections of a young woman, though he stop short 
of positive promises. Vanity is generally the tempter 
in this case; a desire to. be regarded as being admired 
by the women: a very despicable species of vanity, 
but frequently greatly mischievous, notwithstanding. 
You do not, indeed, actually, in so many words, 
promise to marry; but the general tenor of your
-P-A-G-E-131
IT] TO A LOVER . 129 
janguage and deportment has that meaning; you 
know that your meaning is so understood; and if 
you have not such meaning; if you be fixed by some 
previous engagement with, or greater liking for, 
another ; if you know you are here sowing the seeds 
of disappointment ; and if you, keeping your previous 
engagement or greater liking a secret, persevere, in 
spite of the admonitions of conscience, you are guilty 
of deliberate deception, injustice and cruelty: you 
make to God an ungrateful return for those endow- 
ments which have enabled you to achieve this in- 
glorious and unmanly triumph ; and if, as is frequently 
the case, you glory in such triumph, you may have 
person, riches, talents to excite envy; but every 
Just and humane man will abhor your heart. 
141. There are, however, certain cases in which 
you deceive, or nearly deceive, yourself; cases in 
which you are, by degrees and by circumstances, 
deluded into something very nearly resembling sincere 
love for a second object, the first still, however, 
maintaining her ground in your heart; cases in 
which you are not actuated by vanity, in which you 
are not guilty of injustice and cruelty; but cases in 
which you, nevertheless, do wrong: and as I once 
did a wrong of this sort myself, I will here give 
a history of it, as a warning to every young man who 
shall read this little book ; that being the best and, 
indeed, the only atonement, that I can make, or ever 
could have made, for this only serious sin that I ever 
committed against the female sex. 
142, The Province of New Brunswick, in North 
America, in which I passed my years from the age 
of eighteen to that of twenty-six, consists, in general, 
of heaps of rocks, in the interstices of which grow the 
pine, the spruce, and various sorts of fir trees, or, 
where the woods have been burnt down, the bushes 
COBBETT. AD. K

130 COBBETT’S ADVICE [Letter 
of the raspberry or those of the huckleberry. The 
province is cut asunder lengthwise, by a great river, 
called the St. John, about two hundred miles in 
length, and, at half way from the mouth, fulla mile 
wide. Into this main river run innumerable smaller 
rivers, there called crerxs. On the sides of these 
ereeks the land is, in places, clear of rocks; it is, in 
these places, generally good and productive; the 
trees that grow here are the birch, the maple, and 
others of the deciduous class; natural meadows here 
and there present themselves; and some of these 
spots far surpass in rural beauty any other that m 
ores ever beheld; the creeks, abounding towards 
their sources in water-falls of endless variety, as well 
in form as in magnitude, and always teeming with fish, 
while water-fowl enliven their surface, and while wild- 
pigeons, of the gayest plumage, flutter, in thousands 
upon thousands, amongst the branches of the beauti- 
ful trees, which, sometimes, for miles together, form 
an arch over the creeks. 
148. I, in one of my rambles in the woods, in 
which I took great delight, came to a spot at a very 
short distance from the source of one of these creeks. 
Here was every thing to delight the eye, and especi- 
ally of one like me, who seem to have been born to 
love rural life, and trees and plants of all sorts. 
Here were about two hund: acres of natural 
meadow, interspersed with patches of maple-trees in 
various forms and of various extent ; the creek (there 
about thirty miles from its point of joining the 
St. John) ran down the middle of the spot, which 
formed a sort of dish, the high and rocky hills 
rising all round it, except at the outlet of the creek, 
and these hills crowned with lofty pines: in the hills 
were the sources of the creek, the waters of which 
came down in cascades, for any one of which many
-P-A-G-E-133
TIE] TO A LOVER 181 
a nobleman in England would, if he could transfer 
it, give a good slice of his fertile estate ; and in the 
creek, at the foot of the cascades, there were, in. the 
season, salmon the finest in the world, and so 
abundant, and so easily taken, as to be used for 
manuring the land. 
144, If nature, in her very best humour, had made 
a spot for the express purpose of captivating me, 
she could not have exceeded the efforts which she 
had here made. But I found something here besides 
these rude works of nature; I found something in 
the fashioning of which man had had something to 
do. I found a large and well-built log dwelling 
house, standing (in the month of September) on the 
edge of a very good field of Indian Corn, by the side 
of which there was a piece of buck-wheat just then 
mowed. I found a homestead, and some very pretty 
cows. I found all the things by which an easy and 
happy farmer is surrounded: and I found still some- 
thing besides all these ; something that was destined 
to give me a great deal of pleasure and also a t 
deal of pain, both in their extreme degree; and both 
of which, in spite of the lapse of forty years, now 
make an attempt to rush back into my heart. 
145. Partly from misinformation, and partly from 
miscalculation, I had lost my way; and, quite alone, 
but armed with my sword and a brace of pistols, to 
defend myself against the bears, I arrived at the log- 
house in the middle of a moonlight night, the hoar 
frost covering the trees and the grass. A stout and 
clamorous dog, kept off by the gleaming of my sword, 
waked the master of the house, who got up, received 
me with great hospitality, got me something to eat, 
and put me into a feather-bed, a thing that I had 
been a stranger to for some years. I, being very 
tired, had tried to pass the night in the woods, 
K2
-P-A-G-E-134
182 COBBETT’S ADVICE [Letter 
between the trunks of two large trees, which had 
fallen side by side, and within a yard of each other. 
I had made a nest for myself of dry fern, and had 
made a covering by laying boughs of spruce across 
the trunks of the trees. But unable to sleep on 
account of the cold; becoming sick from the great 
quantity of water that I had drank during the heat 
of the day, and being, moreover, alarmed at the noise 
of the bears, and lest one of them should find me in 
a defenceless state, I had roused myself up, and had 
crept along as well as I could, So that no hero of 
eastern romance ever experienced a more enchanting 
change. 
146. I had got into the house of one of those 
Yankee Loyatists, who, at the close of the revolu- 
tionary war (which, until it had succeeded, was called 
a rebellion) had accepted of grants of land in the 
King’s Province of New Brunswick ; and who, to the 
great honour of England, had been furnished with 
all the means of making new and comfortable settle- 
ments. I was suffered to sleep till breakfast time, 
when I found a table, the like of which I have since 
seen so many in the United States, loaded with good 
things. The master and the mistress of the house, aged 
‘about fifty, were like what an English farmer and his 
wife were half a century ago. There were two sons, 
tall'and stout, who appeared to have come in from 
work, and the youngest of whom was about my age, 
then twenty-three. But there was another member of 
the family, aged nineteen, who (dressed according to 
the neat and simple fashion of New England, whence 
she had come with her parents five or six years 
before) had her long light-brown hair twisted nicel 
up, and fastened on the top of her head, in whic! 
head were a pair of livel Hue eyes, associated with 
features of which that softness and that sweetness, so
-P-A-G-E-135
UY] TO A LOVER 138 
characteristic of American girls, were the predomi- 
nant expressions, the whole being set off by a com- 
plexion indicative of glowing health, and forming, 
figure, movements, and all taken together, an assem- 
blage of beauties, far surpassing any that I had ever 
seen but once in my life. That once was, too, two 
years agone ; and, in such a case and at such an age, 
two years, two whole years, is a long, long while! It 
was a space as long as the eleventh part of my then 
life! Here was the present against the absent: here 
was the power of the eyes pitted against that of 
the memory: here were all the senses up in arms 
to subdue the influence of the thoughts: here was 
vanity, here was passion, here was the spot of all 
spots in the world, and here were also the life, and 
the manners and the habits and the pursuits that 
I delighted in: here was every thing that imagina- 
tion can conceive, united in a conspiracy against the 
poor little brunette in England! What, then, did 
I fall in love at once with this bouquet of lilies and 
roses? Oh! by no means. I was, however, so en- 
chanted with the place ; I so much enjoyed its tran- 
quillity, the shade of the maple trees, the business 
of the farm, the sports of the water and of the 
woods, that I stayed at it to the last possible minute, 
promising, at my departure, to come again as often 
as I possibly could; a promise which I most punc- 
tually fulfilled. 
147. Winter is the great season for jaunting and 
dancing (called frolicking) in America. In this 
Province the river and the creeks were the only 
roads from settlement to settlement. In summer we 
travelled in canoes ; in winter in sleighs on the ice or 
snow. During more than two years I spent all the 
time I could with my Yankee friends: they were all fond of me: I talked to them about country affairs,
-P-A-G-E-136
134 COBBETT’S ADVICE [Letter 
my evident delight in which they took as a compliment to themselves: the father and mother treated me as 
one of their children; the sons as a brother; and 
the daughter, who was as modest and as full of 
sensibility as she was beautiful, in a way to which 
a chap much less sanguine than I was would have 
given the tenderest interpretation ; which treatment 
I, especially in the last-mentioned case, most cordially 
repaid. 
148. It is when you meet in company with others 
of your own age that you are, in love matters, put, 
most frequently, to the test, and exposed to detection. 
The next door neighbour might, in that country, be 
ten miles off. We used to have a frolic, sometimes 
at one house and sometimes at another. Here, 
where female eyes are very much on the alert, no 
secret can long be kept; and very soon father, 
mother, brothers and the whole neighbourhood looked 
upon the thing as certain, not excepting herself, to 
whom I, however, had never once even talked of 
marriage, and had never even told her that I loved 
her. But I had a thousand times done these by 
implication, taking into view the interpretation that 
she would naturally put upon my looks, appellations 
and acts; and it was of this, that I had to accuse 
myself. Yet I was not a deceiver; for my affection 
for her was very great: I spent no really pleasant 
hours but with her: I was uneasy if she showed the 
slightest regard for any other young man: J was 
unhappy if the smallest matter affected her health 
or spirits: I quitted her in dejection, and returned 
to her with eager delight: many a time, when 
I could get leave but for a day, I paddled in a canoe 
two whole succeeding nights, in order to pass that 
day with her, If this was not love, it was first 
cousin to it; for as to any criminal intention I no
-P-A-G-E-137
IY] TO A LOVER 135 
more thought of it, in her case, than if she had been 
my sister. Many times I put to myself the questions : 
‘What amI at? Is not this wrong? Why do Igo?’ 
But still I went. 
149. Then, further in my excuse, my prior 
engagement, though carefully left unalluded to by 
both parties, was, in that thin population, and owing 
to the singular circumstances of it, and to the great 
talk that there always was about me, perfectly well 
known to her and all her family. It was matter of 
so much notoriety and conversation in the Province, 
that Genrrat Careron (brother of the late Lord 
Dorchester), who was the Governor when I was there, 
when he, about fifteen years afterwards, did me the 
honour, on his return to England, to come and see 
me at my house in Duke Street, Westminster, asked, 
before he went away, to see my wife, of whom he had 
heard so much before her marriage. So that here 
was no deception on my part: but still I ought not 
to have suffered even the most distant hope to be 
entertained by a person so innocent, so amiable, for 
whom I had so much affection, and to whose heart 
I had no right to give a single twinge. I ought, 
from the very first, to have prevented the possibility 
of her ever feeling pain on my account, I was 
young, to be sure; but I was old enough to know 
what was my duty in this case, and I ought, dismiss- 
ing my own feelings, to have had the resolution to 
perform it. 
150. The last parting came ; and now came my just 
punishment! The time was known to every bad 3 
and was irrevocably fixed; for I had to move with 
a regiment, and the embarkation of a regiment is 
an epoch in a thinly settled province. To describe 
this parting would be too painful even at this distant 
day, and with this frost of age upon my head. The
-P-A-G-E-138
136 COBBETT’S ADVICE 
kind and. virtuous father came forty miles to see me 
just as I was going on board in the river. His looks 
and words I have never forgotten. As the vessel 
descended, she passed the mouth of that creek which 
I had so often entered with delight; and though 
England, and all that England contained, were 
before me, I lost sight of this creek with an aching 
heart. 
151. On what trifles turn the great events in the 
life of man! If I had received a cool letter from my 
intended wife; if I had only heard a rumour of any 
thing from which fickleness in her might have been 
inferred ; if I had found in her any, even the smallest, 
abatement of affection ; if she but let go any one 
of the hundred strings by which she held my heart : 
if any of these, never would the world have heard of 
me. Young as I was; able as I was as a soldier; 
proud as I was of the admiration and commendations 
of which I was the object; fond as I was, too, of the 
command, which, at so early an age, my rare conduct 
and great natural talents had given me; sanguine as 
was my mind, and brilliant as were my prospects: yet 
IT had seen so much of the meannesses, the unjust 
rtialities, the insolent pomposity, the disgusting 
issipations of that way of life, that I was weary 
of it: I longed, exchanging my fine laced coat for 
the Yankee farmer’s home-spun, to be where I should 
never behold the supple crouch of servility, and 
never hear the hectoring voice of authority, again ; and, on the lonely banks of this branch-covered creek, which contained (she out of the question) every thing congenial to my taste and dear to my heart, I, unapplauded, unfeared, unenvied and un- calumniated, should have lived and died,
-P-A-G-E-139
LETTER IV 
TO A HUSBAND 
152. Iv is in this capacity that your conduct will 
have the greatest effect on your happiness; and 
a great deal will depend on the manner in which you 
begin. Tam to suppose that you have made a good 
choice; but a good young woman may be made, 
by a weak, a harsh, a neglectful, an extravagant, or 
rofligate husband, a really bad wife and mother. 
All in a wife, beyond her own natural disposition 
and education is, nine times out of ten, the work of 
her husband. 
153. The first thing of all, be the rank in life 
what it may, is to convince her of the necessity of 
moderation tn expense ; and to make her clearly see 
the justice of beginning to act upon the presumption, 
that there are children coming, that they are to be 
provided for, and that she is to assist in the making 
of that provision. Legally speaking, we have a right 
to do what we please with our own property, which, 
however, is not our own, unless it exceed our debts. 
And, morally speaking, we, at the moment of our 
marriage, contract a debt with the naturally to be 
expected fruit of it ; and, therefore (reserving further 
remarks upon this subject till I come to speak of 
the education of children), the scale of expense 
should, at the beginning, be as low as that of which 
a due attention to rank in life will admit. 
154, The great danger of all is, beginning with 
servants, or a servant. Where there are riches, or
-P-A-G-E-140
138 COBBETT’S ADVICE [Letter 
where the business is so great as to demand help 
in the carrying on of the affairs of a house, one or 
more female servants must be kept; but, where the 
work of a house can be done by one pair of hands, 
why should there be two; especially as you cannot 
have the hands without having the mouth, and, 
which is frequently not less costly, inconvenient and 
injurious, the tongue? When children come, there 
must, at times, be some foreign aid; but, until then, 
what need can the wife of a young tradesman, or 
even farmer (unless the family be great) have of 
a servant? The wife is young, and why is she not 
to work as well as the husband? What justice is 
there in wanting you to keep two women instead of 
one? You have not married them both in form; 
but, if they be inseparable, you have married them 
in substance; and if you are free from the crime of 
bigamy, you have the far most burthensome part of 
its consequences. 
155. Tam well aware of the unpopularity of this 
doctrine; well aware of its hostility to prevalent 
habits ; well aware that almost every tradesman and 
every farmer, though with scarcely a shilling to call 
his own; and that every clerk, and every such person, 
begins by keeping a servant, and that the latter is 
generally provided before the wife be installed: 
Tam well aware of all this; but knowing, from long 
and attentive observation, that it is the great bane 
of the marriage life; the great cause of that penury, 
and of those numerous and tormenting embarrass- 
ments, amidst which conjugal felicity can seldom long 
be kept alive, I give the advice, and state the reasons 
on which it was founded. 
156. In London, ‘or near it, a maid servant can- 
not be kept at an oxpenst so low as that of thirty 
pounds a year; for, besides her wages, board and
-P-A-G-E-141
Tv] “TO A HUSBAND 139 
lodging, there must be a fire solely for her; or she 
must sit with the husband and wife, hear every word 
that passes between them, and between them and 
their friends; which will, of course, greatly add to 
the pleasures of their fireside! To keep her tongue 
still would be impossible, and, indeed, unreasonable ; 
and if, as may frequently happen, she be prettier 
than the wife, she will know how to give the suitable 
interpretation to the looks which, to a next to a 
certainty, she will occasionally get from him, whom, 
as it were in mockery, she calls by the name of 
‘master? This is almost downright bigamy; but 
this can never do; and, therefore, she must have 
a fire to herself. Besides the blaze of coals, however, 
there is another sort of flame that she will inevitably 
covet. She will by no means be sparing of the coals ; 
but, well fed and well lodged, as she will be, what- 
ever you may be, she will naturally sigh for the fire 
of love, for which she carries in her bosom a match 
always ready prepared. Yn plain language, you have 
a man to keep, a part, at least, of every week ; and 
the leg of lamb, which might have lasted you and 
your wife for three days, will, by this gentleman’s 
sighs, be borne away in one. Shut the door against 
this intruder; out she goes herself: and, if she go 
empty-handed, she is no true Christian, or, at least, 
will not be looked upon as such by the charitable 
friend at whose house she meets the longing soul, 
dying partly with love and partly with hunger. 
157. The cost, altogether, is nearer fifty pounds 
a year than thirty. How many thousands of trades- 
men and clerks, and the like, who might have passed 
through life without a single embarrassment, have lived 
in continual trouble and fear, and founda premature 
grave, from this very cause, and this cause alone! 
When I, on my return from America, in 1800, lived a

short time in Saint James’s Street, following my habit 
of early rising, I used to see the servant maids, at 
almost every house, dispensing charity at the expense 
of their masters, long before they, good men, opened 
their eyes, who thus did deeds of benevolence, not 
only without boasting of them, but without knowing 
of them. Meat, bread, cheese, butter, coals, candles ; 
all came with equal freedom from these liberal hands. 
I have observed the same, in my early walks and 
rides, in every part of this great place and its en- 
virons, Where there is one servant it is worse than 
where there are wo or more; for, happily for their 
employers, they do not always agree. So that the 
oppression is most heavy on those who are the least 
al fe to bear it: and particularly on clerks, and such 
like people, whose wives seem to think, that, because 
the ius nd’s work is of a genteel description, they 
ought to live the life of ladies. Poor fellows! their 
work is not hard and rough, to be sure; but, it is 
work, and work for many hours too, and painful 
enough ; and as to their income, it scarcely exceeds, 
on an average, the double, at any rate, of that of 
a journeyman carpenter, bricklayer, or tailor. 
158. Besides, the man and wife will live on cheaper 
diet and drink than a servant will live. Thousands, 
who would never have had beer in their house, have 
it for the servant, who will not live without it. 
However frugal your wife, her frugality is of little 
use, if she have one of these inmates to provide for. 
Many a hundred thousand times has it happened 
that the butcher and the butter-man have been applied to solely because there was a servant to satisfy. You cannot, with this clog everlastingly 
attached to you, be frugal, if you would: you can save nothing against the days of expense, which are, however, pretty sure to come, And why should you
-P-A-G-E-143
IV] TO A HUSBAND 141 
bring into your house a trouble like this ; an absolute 
annoyance ; a something for your wife to watch, to 
be a constraint upon her, to thwart her in her best 
intentions, to make her uneasy, and to sour her 
temper? Why should you do this foolish thing? 
Merely to comply with corrupt fashion ; merely from 
false shame, and false and contemptible pride? If 
a young man were, on his marriage, to find any 
difficulty in setting this ruinous fashion at defiance, 
a very good way would be to count down to his 
wife, at the end of every week, the amount of the 
expense of a servant for that week, and request her 
to deposit it in her drawer. In a short time she 
would find the sum so large, that she would be 
frightened at the thoughts of a servant ; and would 
never dream of one again, except in case of absolute 
necessity, and then for as short a time as possible. 
159. But the wife may not be able to do all the 
work to be done in the house. Not able! A youn; 
woman not able to cook and wash, and mend an 
make, and clean the house and make the bed for 
one young man and herself, and that young man 
her husband too, who is quite willing (if he be worth 
a straw) to put up with cold dinner, or with a crust ; 
to get up and light her fire; to do any thing that 
the mind can suggest to spare her labour, and to 
conduce to her convenience! Not able to do this? 
Then, if she brought no fortune, and he had none, 
she ought not to have been able to marry: and, let 
me tell you, young man, a small fortune would not 
put a servant-keeping wife upon an equality with 
one who required no such inmate. 
160. If, indeed, the work of a house were harder 
than a young woman could perform without pain, 
or great fatigue; if it had a tendency to impair 
her health or deface her beauty; then you might
-P-A-G-E-144
142 COBBETT’S ADVICE [Letter 
hesitate: but, it is not too hard, and it tends to 
-preserve health, to keep the spirits buoyant, and, 
of course, to preserve beauty. You often hear girls, 
while scrubbing or washing, singing till they are out 
of breath; but never while they are at what they 
call working at the needle, The American wives are 
most exemplary in this respect. They have none 
of that false pride, which prevents thousands in 
England from doing that which interest, reason, 
and even their own inclination would prompt them 
to do. They work, not from necessity; not from 
compulsion of any sort; for their husbands are the 
most indulgent in the whole world. In the towns 
they go to the market, and cheerfully carry home 
the result: in the country, they not only do the 
work in the house, but extend their labours to the 
garden, plant and weed and hoe, and gather and‘ 
preserve the fruits and the herbs; and this, too, in 
a climate far from being so favourable to labour 
as that of England; and they are amply repaid for 
these by those gratifications which their excellent 
economy enables their husbands to bestow upon 
them, and which it is their universal habit to do 
with a liberal hand. . 
161. But did I practise what I am here preaching? ~ 
Aye, and to the full extent. Till I had a second 
child, no servant ever entered my house, though well 
able to keep one; and never, in my whole life, did 
I live ina Shouse so clean, in such trim order, and 
never have I eaten or drunk, or slept or dressed, in 
a manner so. perfectly to my fancy, as I did then. 
I had a great deal of business to attend to,. that 
took me a great part. of the day from home; but, 
whenever I could spare a minute from business, the 
child was in my arms; I rendered the mother’s 
labour as light as I could; any bit of food satisfied

me; when watching was necessary, we shared it 
between us; and that famous Grammar for teaching 
French people English, which has been for thirt: 
years, and still is, the great work of this kind, 
throughout all America, and in every nation in 
Europe, was written by me, in hours not employed 
in business, and, in great part, during my share of 
the night-watchings over a sick, and then only child, 
who, after lingering many months, died in my arms. 
162. This was the way that we went on: this was 
the way that we began the married life; and surely, 
that which we did with pleasure no young couple, 
unendowed with fortune, ought to be ashamed to do. 
But she may be #J; the time may be near at hand, 
or may have actually arrived, when she must en- 
counter that particular pain and danger of which 
you have been the happy cause! Oh! that is quite 
another matter! And if you now exceed in care, 
in watchings over her, in tender attention to all her 
wishes, in anxious efforts to quiet. her fears; if you 
exceed in pains and expense to procure her relief 
and secure her life; if you, in any of these, exceed 
that which I would recommend, you must be romantic 
indeed! She deserves them all, and more than all, 
ten thousand times told. And now it is that you 
feel the blessing conferred by her economy. That 
heap of money, which might have been squandered 
on, or by, or in consequence of, an useless servant, 
you now have in hand wherewith to procure an 
abundance of that skill and that attendance of which 
she stands in absolute need ; and she, when restored 
to you in smiling health, has the just pride to reflect, 
that she may have owed her life and your happiness 
to the effects of her industry. soe 
163. It is the beginning that is every thing in 
this important case; and you will have, perhaps,
-P-A-G-E-146
144 COBBETT’S ADVICE [Letter 
much to do to convince her, not that what you 
recommend is advantageous; not that it is right; 
but to convince her that she can do it without sink- 
ing below the station that she ou

But the truth is, that there ought .. 22 0 LL. 
at all; this important matter ought to be settled 
and full agreed on beforehand. If she really love 
you, and have common sense, she will not hesitate 
a moment; and if she be deficient in either of these 
respects; and if you be so mad in love as to be 
unable to exist without her, it is better to cease 
to exist at once, than to become the toiling and 
embarrassed slave of a wasting and pillaging servant. 
164, The next thing to be attended to is, your 
demeanor towards a young wife. As to oldish ones, 
or widows, time and other things have, in most cases, 
blunted their feelings, and rendered harsh or stern 
demeanor in the husband a matter not of heart- 
breaking consequence. But with a young and inex- 
perienced one, the case is very different; and you 
should bear in mind, that the first frown that she 
receives from you is a dagger to her heart. Nature 
has so ordered it, that men shall become less ardent 
in their passion after the wedding day; and that 
women shall not, Their ardour increases rather 
than the contrary; and they are surprisingly quick- 
sighted and inquisitive on this score. en the 
child comes, it divides this ardour with the father ; 
but until then you have it all; and if you have a 
mind to be happy, repay it with all your soul. Let 
what may happen to put you out of humour with 
others, let nothing put you out of humour with her, 
 
-P-A-G-E-147
IV] TO A HUSBAND 145 
Let your words and looks and manners be just what 
they were before you called her wife. 
165. But now, and throughout your life, show 
your affection for her, and your admiration of her, 
not in nonsensical compliment; not in picking up 
her handkerchief, or her glove, or in carrying her 
fan or parasol; not, if you have the means, in hang- 
ing trinkets and baubles upon her; not in making 
yourself a fool by winking at, and seeming pleased 
at, her foibles, or follies,-or faults; but show them 
by acts of real goodness towards her; prove by un- 
equivocal deeds the high value that you set on her 
health and life and peace of mind; Jet your praise 
of her go to the full extent of her deserts, but let it 
be consistent with truth and with sense, and such as 
to convince her of your sincerity. He who is the 
flatterer of his wife only prepares her ears for the 
hyperbolical stuff of others. ‘The kindest appella- 
tion that her Christian name affords is the best you 
can use, especially before faces. An everlasting ‘my 
dear’ is but. a sorry compensation for a want of that 
sort of love that makes the husband cheerfully toil 
by day, break his rest by night, endure all sorts of 
hardships, if the life or health of his wife demand it. 
Let your deeds, and not your words, carry to her 
heart a daily and hourly confirmation of the fact, 
that you value her health and life and happiness 
beyond all other things in the world ; and let this be 
manifest to her, particularly at those times when life 
is always more or less in danger. 
166. I began my young marriage days in and 
near Philadelphia. At one of those times to which 
I have just alluded, in the middle of the burning hot 
month of July, I was greatly afraid of fatal conse- 
quences to my wife for want of sleep, she not having, 
after the great danger was over, had any sleep for 
COBBETT, AD, L
-P-A-G-E-148
146 COBBETT’S ADVICE [Letter 
more than forty-eight hours. All great cities, in hot 
countries, are, I believe, full of dogs; and they, in 
the very hot weather, keep up, during the night, a 
horrible barking and fighting and howling. Upon 
the particular occasion to which I am adverting, 
they made a noise so terrible and so unremitted, that, 
it was next to impossible that even a person in full’ 
health and free from pain should obtain a minute's 
sleep. I was, about nine in the evening, sitting by 
the bed: ‘Ido think,’ said she, ‘that I could go to 
sleep now, if it were not for the dogs. Down stairs 
I went, and out I sallied, in my shirt and trowsers, 
and without shoes and stockings; and, going to a 
heap of stones lying beside the road, set to work 
upon the dogs, going backward and forward, and 
keeping them at two or three hundred yards’ distance 
from the house. I walked thus the whole night, 
barefooted, lest the noise of my shoes might possibly 
reach her ears; and I remember that the bricks of 
the causeway were, even in the night, so hot as to 
be disagreeable to my feet. My exertions produced 
the desired effect: a sleep of several hours was the 
consequence; and, at eight o’clock in the morning, 
off went I to a day’s business, which was to end at 
six in the evening. 
167. Women are all patriots of the soil; and 
when her neighbours used to ask my wife whether 
all English husbands were like hers, she boldly 
answered in the affirmative. I had business to 
occupy the whole of my time, Sundays and week- 
days, except sleeping hours; but J used to make 
time to assist her in the taking care of her baby, 
and in all sorts of things: get up, light her fire, 
boil her tea-kettle, carry her up warm water in cold 
weather, take the child while she dressed herself and 
got the breakfast ready, then breakfast, get her

in water and wood for the day, then dress myself 
neatly, and sally forth to my business. The moment 
that was over I used to hasten back to her again; 
and I no more thought of spending a moment away 
from her, unless business compelled me, than I 
thought of quitting the country and going to sea. 
The thunder and lightning are tremendous in. 
America, compared with what they are in England. 
My wife was, at one time, very much afraid of 
thunder and lightning; and as is the feeling of all 
such women, and, indeed, all men too, she wanted 
company, and particularly her husband, in those 
times of danger. I knew well, of course, that my 
presence would not diminish the danger; but, be I 
at what I might, if within reach of home, I used to 
quit my business and hasten to her, the moment I 
perceived a thunder storm approaching. Scores of 
miles have I, first and last, rwn on this errand, in the 
streets of Philadelphia! 'The Frenchmen, who were 
my scholars, used to laugh at me exceedingly on this 
account ; and sometimes, when I was making an a) 
pointment with them, they would say, with a smile 
and a bow, ‘Sawve la tonnerre toujours, Monsieur 
Cobbett.’ 
168. I never dangled about at the heels of my 
wife; seldom, very seldom, ever walked out, as it is 
called, with her; I never ‘went a walking’ in the 
whole course of my life; never went to walk without 
having some object in view other than the walk; 
and, as I never could walk at a slow pace, it would 
have been hard work for her to keep up with me; 
so that, in the nearly forty years of our married 
life. we have not walked out together, perhaps, 
twenty times, I hate a dangler, who is more like a 
footman than a husband. It is very cheap to be 
kind in trifles; but that which rivets the affections

is not to be purchased with money. The great 
thing of all, however, is to prove your anxiety at 
those times of peril to her, and for which times you, 
nevertheless, wish. Upon those occasions I was never 
from home, be the necessity for it ever so great: it 
was my rule, that every thing must give way to thai 
In the year 1809, some English local militiamen 
were flogged, in the Isle of Ely, in England, under 
& guard of Hanoverians, then stationed in England, 
I, reading an account of this in a London newspaper, 
called the Counrer, expressed my indignation at it 
in such terms as it became an Englishman to do. 
The Attorney General, Gibbs, was set on upon me}; 
he harassed me for nearly a year, then brought me 
to trial, and I was, by Ellenborough, Grose, Le 
Blanc, and Bailey, sentenced to two years’ imprison- 
ment in Newgate, to pay a fine to the king of a 
thousand pounds, and to be held in heavy bail for 
seven years after the expiration of the ‘imprison- 
ment! Every one regarded it as a sentence of death. 
I lived in the country at the time, seventy miles 
from London; I had a farm on my hands; I had 
a family of small children, amongst whom I had 
constantly lived; I had a most anxious and devoted 
wife, who was, too, in that state, which rendered the 
separation more painful ten-fold. I was put into 
a place amongst félons, from which I had to rescue 
myself at the price of twelve guineas a week for the 
whole of the two years, The king, poor man! was, at the close of my imprisonment, not in a condition to receive the thousand pounds; but his son, the present. king, punctually received it ‘in his name and behalf ;’ and he keeps it still. 
169. The sentence, though it proved not to be one of death, was, in effect, one of ruin, as far as then-possessed property went. But this really ap-

peared as nothing, compared with the circumstance, 
that I must now have a child born in a felons jail, 
or be absent from the scene at the time of the birth. 
My wife, who had come to see me for the last time 
previous to her lying-in, ‘iving my deep dejection 
at the approach of her departure for Botley, resolved 
not to go; and actually went and took a lodging as 
near to Newgate as she could find one, in order that 
the communication between us might be as speedy 
as possible; and in order that I might see the 
doctor, and receive assurances from him relative to 
her state. The nearest lodging that she could find 
was in Skinner-street, at the corner of a street lead- 
ing to Smithfield. So that there she was, amidst 
the incessant rattle of coaches and butchers’ carts, 
and the noise of cattle, dogs, and bawling men; 
instead of being in a quiet and commodious country- 
house, with neighbours and servants and every thing 
necessary about her. Yet, so great is the power of 
the mind in such cases, she, though the circum- 
stances proved uncommonly perilous, and were 
attended with the loss of the child, bore her suffer- 
ings with the greatest composure, because, at any 
minute she could send a message to, and hear from, 
me. If she had gone to Botley, leaving me in that 
state of anxiety in which she saw me, I am satisfied 
that she would have died; and that event taking 
place at such a distance from me, how was I to con- 
template her corpse, surrounded by her distracted 
children, and to have escaped death, or madness, 
myself? If such was not the effect of this merciless 
act of the government towards me, that amiable 
body may be well assured that I have taken and 
recorded the will for the deed, and that as such it 
will live in my memory as long as that memory 
shall last. : :

and because I believe that my example may have 
weight with many thousands, as it he.

baubles and trinkets; it is not the - 
about from show to show, and from wav 1» vauce 
pleasure to pleasure. It is none of these that endears 
you to her: it is the adherence to that part of the 
promise you have made her: ‘ With my body I thee 
worship ;’ that is to say, respect and honour by 
personal attention and acts of affection. And re- 
member, that the greatest possible proof that you 
can give of real and solid affection is to give her 
your time, when not wanted in matters of business ; 
when not wanted for the discharge of some duty, 
either towards the public or towards private persons. 
Amongst duties of this sort, we must, of course, in 
some ranks and circumstances of life, include the 
intercourse amongst friends and neighbours, which 
may frequently and reasonably call the husband from 
his home: but what are we to think of the husband 
who is in the habit of leaving his own fire-side, after 
the business of the day is over, and seeking pro- 
miscuous companions in the ale or the coffee house? 
I am told that, in France, it is rare to meet with 
a husband who does not spend every evening of his life in what is called a caffé; that is to say, a place 
for no other purpose than that of gossipping, drink- 
ing and gaming. And it is with great sorrow that I acknowledge that many English husbands indulge too much in a similar habit. Drinking clubs, smoking clubs, singing clubs, clubs of odd-fellows, whist clubs, sotting clubs: these are inexcusable, they are cen-

surable, they are at once foolish and wicked, even in 
single men; what must they be, then, in husbands ; 
and how are they to answer, not only to their wives, 
but to their children, for this profligate abandon- 
ment of their homes; this breach of their solemn 
vow made to the former, this evil example to the 
latter ? 
171. Innumerable are the miseries that spring 
from this cause. ‘The expense is, in the first place, 
very considerable. I much question whether, amongst 
tradesmen, a shilling a night pays the average score ; 
and that, too, for that which is really worth nothin; 
at all, and cannot, even by possibility, be attend 
with any one single advantage, however small. 
Fifteen pounds a year thus thrown away, would 
amount, in the course of a tradesman’s life, to a 
decent fortune for a child, ‘Then there is the injury 
to health from these night adventures; there are 
the quarrels; there is the vicious habit of loose 
and filthy talk ; there are the slanders and the back- 
bitings; there is the admiration of contemptible 
wit, and there are the scoffings at all that is sober 
and serious. 
172. And does the husband who thus abandons his 
wife and children imagine that she will not, in some 
degree at least, follow his example? If he do, he is 
very much deceived, If she imitate him even in 
drinking, he has no great reason to complain; and 
then the cost may be two shillings the night instead 
of one, equal in amount to the cost of all the bread 
wanted in the family, while the baker’s bill is, 
perhaps, unpaid, Here are the slanderings, too, 
going on at home; for, while the husbands are 
assembled, it would be hard if the wives were not to 
do the same; and the very least that is to be ex- 
pected is, that the tea-pot should keep pace with the
-P-A-G-E-154
152 COBBETT’S ADVICE [Letter 
porter-pot or grog-glass. Hence crowds of female 
acquaintances and intruders, and all the consequent 
and inevitable squabbles which form no small part 
of the torment of the life of man. 
178. If you have servants, they know to a momen’ 
the time of your absence; and they regulate thei 
proceedings accordingly. ‘Like master like man,’ i 
an old and true proverb; and it is natural, if no 
just, that it should be thus; for it would be unjus! 
if the careless and neglectful sot were served as faith: 
fully as the vigilant, attentive and sober man. Late 
hours, cards and dice, are amongst the consequences 
of the master’s absence; and why not, seeing that 
he is setting the example? Fire, candle, profligate 
visitants, expences, losses, children ruined in habits 
and morals, and, in short, a train of evils hardly to 
be enumerated, arise from this most vicious habit 
of the master spending his leisure time from home. 
But beyond all the rest is the #l-treatment of the 
wife. When left to ourselves we all seek the com- 
pany that we like best; the company in which we 
take the most delight: and therefore every husband, 
be his state of hte what it may, who spends his 
leisure time, or who, at least, is in the habit of doin 
it, in company other than that of his wife am 
family, tells her and them, as plainly by deeds as 
he could possibly do by words, that he takes more 
delight in other company than in theirs. Children repay this with disregard for their father; but to a wife of any sensibility, it is either a dagger to her heart or an incitement to revenge, and revenge, too, of a species which a young woman will seldom be long in want of the means to gratify. In conclusion of these remarks respecting absentee husbands, I would recommend all those who are prone to, or likely to fall into, the practice, to remember the
-P-A-G-E-155
IV] TO A HUSBAND 153 
words of Mrs. SuLLEN, in the Beaux’ Srratacem: 
‘My husband,’ says she, addressing a footman whom 
she had taken as a paramour, ‘comes reeling home 
at midnight, tumbles in beside me as a salmon 
flounces in a net, oversets the economy of my bed, 
belches the fumes of his drink in my face, then 
twists himself round, leaving me half naked, and 
listening till morning to that tuneful nightingale, 
his nose.” It is at least forty-three years since I 
read the Beaux’ Srraracem, and I now quote from 
memory; but the passage has always occurred to 
me whenever I have seen a sottish husband; and 
though that species of revenge, for the taking of 
which the lady made this apology, was carrying the 
thing too far, yet I am ready to confess, that if I 
had to sit in judgment on her for taking even this 
revenge, my sentence would be very lenient; for 
what right has such a husband to expect fidelity ? 
He has broken his vow; and by what rule of right 
has she to be bound to hers? She thought that 
she was marrying a man; and she finds that she 
was married to a beast. He has, indeed, committed 
no offence that the law of the land can reach; but he 
has violated the vow by which he obtained possession 
of her person; and, in the eye of justice, the com- 
pact between them is dissolved. 
174, The way to avoid the sad consequences of 
which I have been speaking is to begin well: many 
a man has become a sottish husband, and brought 
a family to ruin, without being sottishly inclined, 
and without liking the gossip of the ale or coffee 
house. It is by slow degrees that the mischief is 
done. He is first inveigled, and, in time, he really 
likes the thing ; and, when arrived at that point, he 
is incurable. Let him resolve, from the very first, 
never.to spend an hour from home, unless business,

him never go, in one single instance, unnecessarily

and if he begin right, the pleasure that he will 
derive from it will induce him to continue right. 
This is not being ‘tied to the apron-strings, which 
means quite another matter, as I shall show by-and- 
by. It is being at the husband's place, whether he 
have children or not. And is there any want of 
matter for conversation between a man and his wife ? 
Why not talk of the daily occurrences to her, as well 
as to any body else; and especially to a company

cost is not half of what you spend per day at the

short, what must that man be made of, who does 
not prefer sitting by his own fire-side with his wife 
and children, reading to them, or hearing them read,

hours of the day and night. Sailors, soldiers, mer-

and even some in the very lowest walks, are some- 
times compelled by their affairs, or by circumstances, 
to be from their homes. But what I protest against 
is, the habit of spending leisure hours from home, 
and near to it; and doing this without any necessity, 
and by choice: liking the next door, or any house 
in the same street, better than your own, When 
absent from necessity, there is no wound given to the 
heart of the wife; she concludes that you would be 
with her if you could, and that satisfies; she laments 
the absence, but submits to it without complaining. 
Yet, in these cases, her feelings ought to be con- 
sulted as much as possible; she ought to be fully 
apprised of the probable duration of the absence, 
any of the time of return; and if these be dependent 
on circumstances, those circumstances ought to be 
fully stated; for you have no right to keep her 
mind upon the rack, when you have it in your 
power to put it in a state of ease. Few men have 
more frequently taken from home by business, 
or by a necessity of some sort, than I have; and 
I can positively assert, that, as to my return, I never 
once disappointed my wife in the whole course of 
our married life. it the time of return was con- 
tingent, I never failed to keep her informed from 
day to day: if the time was fixed, or when it became 
fixed, my arrival was as sure as my life. Going 
from London to Botley, once, with Mr. Finnerty, 
whose name I can never pronounce without an ex- 
pression of my regard for his memory, we stopped 
at Axron, to dine with a friend, who, delighted with
-P-A-G-E-158
156 COBBETT’S ADVICE [Letter 
Finnerty’s talk, as every body else was, kept us till 
ten or eleven o'clock, and was proceeding to the other 
botéile, when I put in my protest, saying, ‘We must. 
go, my wife will be frightened.’ ‘Blood, man,’ said 
Finnerty, ‘you do not mean to go home to-night!” 
I told him I did; and then sent my son, who was 
with us, to order out the post-chaise. We. had 
twenty-three miles to go, during which we debated 
the question, whether Mrs. Cosserr would be up to 
receive us, I contending for the affirmative, and he 
for the negative. She was up, and had a nice fire 
for us to sit down at. She had not committed the 
matter to a servant: her servants and children were 
all in bed; and she was up, to perform the duty of 
receiving her husband and his friend. ‘You did 
not expect him?” said Finnerty. ‘To be sure I did,’ 
said she; ‘he never disappointed me in his life.’ 
177. Now, if all young men knew how much value 
women set upon this species of fidelity, there would 
be fewer unhappy couples than there are. If men 
have appointments with lords, they never dream of 
breaking them; and I can assure them that wives 
are as sensitive in this res as lords. I had seen 
many instances of confuael sanbappiness arising out 
of that carelessness which left wives in a state of 
uncertainty as to the movements of their husbands ; 
and I took care, from the very outset, to guard 
against it. For no man has a right to sport with 
the feelings of any innocent person whatever, and 
particularly with those of one who has committed 
er happiness to his hands. The truth is, that men 
in general look upon women as having no feelings 
different from their own; and they know that they 
themselves would regard such disappointments as 
nothing. But this is a great mistake: women feel 
more acutely than men; their love is more ardent, 
 
-P-A-G-E-159
IV] TO A HUSBAND 157 
more pure, more lasting, and they are more frank 
and sincere in the utterance of their feelings. They 
ought to be treated with due consideration had for 
all their amiable qualities and all their weaknesses, 
and nothing by which their minds are affected ought 
to be deemed a trifle. 
178. When we consider what a young woman 
gives up on her wedding day; she makes a surrender, 
an absolute surrender, of her liberty, for the joint 
lives of the parties; she gives the husband the abso- 
lute right of causing her to live in what place, and 
in what manner and what society, he pleases; she 
gives him the power to take from her, and to use, 
for his own purposes, all her goods, unless reserved 
by some legal instrument; and, above all, she sur- 
renders to him her person. Then, when we consider 
the pains which they endure for us, and the large 
share of all the anxious parental cares that fall to 
their lot; when we consider their devotion to us, 
and how unshaken their affection remains in our 
ailments, even though the most tedious and disgust- 
ing; when we consider the offices that they perform, 
and cheerfully perform, for us, when, were we left 
to one another, we should perish from neglect ; 
when we consider their devotion to their children: 
how ‘evidently they love them better, in numerous 
instances, than their own lives; when we consider 
these things, how can a just man think any thing 
a trifle that affects their happiness? I was once 
going, in my gig, up the hill, in the village of 
Franxrorp, near Philadelphia, when a little girl, 
about two years old, who had toddled away from 
a small house, was lying basking in the sun, in the 
middle of the road. About two hundred yards 
before I got to the child, the teams, five big horses 
in each, of three wagons, the drivers of which had
-P-A-G-E-160
158 COBBETT’S ADVICE [Letter 
stopped to drink at a tavern on the brow of the hill, 
started off, and came, nearly abreast, galloping down 
the road. I got my gig off the road as speedily as 
I could; but expected to see the poor child crushed 
to pieces. A young man, a journeyman carpenter, 
who was shingling a shed by the side of the road, 
seeing the child, and seeing the danger, though a 
stranger to the parents, jumped from the top of the 
shed, ran into the road, and snatched up the child, 
from scarcely an inch before the hoof of the leading 
horse. ‘The horse’s leg knocked him down ; but -he, 
catching the child by its clothes, flung it back, out 
of the way of the other horses, and saved himself by 
rolling back with surprising agility. The mother 
of the child, who had, apparently, been washing, 
seeing the teams coming, and seeing the situation 
of the child, rushed out, and catching up the child, 
just as the carpenter had flung it back, and huggi 
it in her arms, uttered a shrick such as I never card 
before, never heard since, and, I hope, shall never 
hear again; and then she dropped down, as if per- 
fectly dead! By the application of the usual means, 
she was restored, however, in a little while; and I, 
being about to depart, asked the carpenter if he 
were a married man, and whether he were a relation 
of the parents of the child. He said he was neither : 
‘Well, then,’ said I, ‘you merit the gratitude of 
every father and mother in the world, and I will 
show mine, by giving you what I have,’ pulling out 
the nine or ten dollars that I had in my pocket, 
‘No; I thank you, Sir, said he: ‘I have on ry done 
what it was my duty to do.’ 
179. Bravery, ' isinterestedness, and maternal 
affection surpassing these, it is impossible to imagine. The mother was going right in amongst the feet of these powerful and wild horses, and amongst the
-P-A-G-E-161
IV] TO A HUSBAND 159 
wheels of the wagons. She had no thought for her- 
self; no feeling of fear for her own life; her shriek 
was the sound of inexpressible joy ; joy too great for 
her to support herself under. Perhaps ninety-nine 
mothers out of every hundred would Pave acted the 
same part, under similar circumstances, There are, 
comparatively, very few women not replete with 
maternal love; and, by-the-by, take you care, if you 
meet with a girl who ‘is not fond of children, not to 
marry her by any means. Some few there are who 
even make a boast that they ‘cannot bear children,’ 
that is, cannot endure them. I never knew a man 
that was good for much who had a dislike to little 
children; and I never knew a woman of that taste 
who was good for any thing at all. I have seen 
a few such in the course of my life, and I have never 
wished to see one of them a second time. 
180. Being fond of little children argues no 
effeminacy in a man, but, as far as my observation 
has gone, the contrary, A regiment of soldiers 
presents no bad school wherein to study character. 
Soldiers have leisure, too, to play with children, as well 
as with ‘ women and dogs,’ for which the proverb has 
made them famed. And I have never observed that 
effeminacy was at all the marked companion of 
fondness for little children, This fondness manifestly 
arises from a compassionate feeling towards creatures 
that are helpless, and that must be innocent. For 
my own part, how many days, how many months, all 
put together, have I spent with babies in my arms! 
My time, when at home, and when babies were going 
on, was chiefly divided between the pen and the 
baby. I have fed them and put them to sleep 
hundreds of times, though there were servants to 
whom the task might have been transferred. Yet, 
I have not been effeminate; I have not been idle;
-P-A-G-E-162
160 COBBETT’S ADVICE [Letter 
J have not been a waster of time; but I should have 
been all these if I had disliked 1 babies, and had liked 
the porter pot and the grog glass. : 
181. It Pan old sayings ‘Praise the child, and 
ou make love to the mother ;’ and it is surprising 
how far this will go. To a fond mother you car 
do nothing so pleasing as to praise the baby, and, 
the younger it is, the more she values the compliment. 
Say fine things to her, and take no notice of her 
baby, and she will despise you. I have often beheld 
this, in many women, with great admiration; and 
it is a thing that no husband ought to overlook 
for if the wife wish her child to be admired by others; 
what must be the ardour of her wishes with regard: 
to his admiration. There was a drunken dog of 
a Norfolk man in our regiment, who came from 
Thetford, I recollect, who used to say, that his wife 
would forgive him for spending all the pay, and the 
washing money into the bargain, ‘if he would but 
kiss her ugly brat, and say it was pretty.’ Now, 
though this was a very profligate fellow, he had 
philosophy in him ; and. certain it is, that there is 
nothing worthy of the name of conjugal happiness, 
unless the husband clearly evince that he is fond of 
his children, and that, too, from their very birth. 
182. But though all the aforementioned con- 
siderations demand from us the kindest possible 
treatment of a wife, the husband is to expect dutiful 
deportment at her hands. He is not to be her slave ; 
he is not to yield to: her against the dictates of his 
own reason and judgment ; it is her duty to obey 
all his lawful commands ; and, if she have sense, she 
will eive that it is a disgrace to herself to ac- knowledge, as a husband, a thing over which she has an absolute controul. It should always be recollected that you are the party whose body must,
-P-A-G-E-163
IV} TO A HUSBAND 16) 
if any do, lie in jail for debt, and for debts of her 
contracting, too, as well as of your own contracting. 
Over her tongue, too, you possess a clear right to 
exercise, if necessary, some controul; for if she use it 
in an unjustifiable manner, it is against you, and 
not against her, that the law enables, and justly 
enables, the slandered party to proceed; which 
would be monstrously unjust, if the law were not 
founded on the right which the husband has to 
control, if necessary, the tongue of the wife, to compel 
her to keep it within the limits prescribed by the 
law. A charming, a most enchanting, life, indeed, 
would be that of a husband, if he were bound to 
cohabit with and to maintain one for all the debts 
and all the slanders of whom he was answerable, 
and over whose conduct he possessed no compulsory 
controul. / 
183, Of the remedies in the case of really bad wives, 
squanderers, drunkards, adultresses, I shall speak 
further on ; it being the habit of us all to put off to 
the last possible moment the performance of dis- 
agreeable duties. But, far short of these vices, there 
are several faults in a wife that may, if not cured in 
time, lead to great unhappiness, great injury to the 
interests as well as character of her husband and 
children; and which faults it is, therefore, the 
husband’s duty to correct. A wife may be chaste, 
sober in the full sense of the word, industrious, 
cleanly, frugal, and may be devoted to her husband 
and her children to a degree so enchanting as to 
make them all love her beyond the power of words 
to express. And yet she may, partly under the in- 
fluence of her natural disposition, and partly encour- 
aged by the great and constant homage paid to her 
virtues, and presuming, too, on the pain with which 
she knows her will would be thwarted; she may, 
COBBETT. AD. M
-P-A-G-E-164
162 COBBETT’S ADVICE [Letter 
with all her virtues, be thus led to a bold interference 
in the affairs of her husband ; may attempt to dictate 
to him in matters quite out of her own sphere s and, 
in the pursuit of the gratification of her love of 
power and command, may wholly overlook the acts 
of folly or injustice which she would induce her 
husband to commit, and overlook, too, the contempti- 
ble thing that she is making the man whom it is her 
duty to honour and obey, and the abasement of whom 
cannot take place without some portion of degrada- 
tion falling upon herself. At the time when ‘THE 
BOOK?’ came out, relative to the late ill-treated 
Queen Canotinz, I was talking upon the subject, 
one day, with a parson, who had not read the Book, 
but who, as was the fashion with all those who were 
looking up to the government, condemned the Queen 
unheard, ‘Now,’ said I, ‘be not so shamefully un- 
just; but get the book, read it, and then give your 
yudgment.’—‘ Indeed,’ said his wife, who was sitting 
y, ‘but HE SHA’ NT, pronouncing the words 
sha n’t with an emphasis and a voice tremendoush 
masculine. ‘Oh! said I,‘ if he SHA’ N’T, that is 
another matter; but, if he sha’ n’t read, if he sha’ n’t 
hear the evidence, he sha’ n’t be looked upon, by me, 
as a just judge ; and I sha’ n't regard him, in future, 
as having any opinion of his own in any thing.” All 
which the husband, the poor henpecked thing, heard 
without a, word escaping his lips. 
184, A husband thus under command, is the most 
contemptible of God’s creatures. Nobody can place 
reliance on him for any thing; whether in the 
capacity of employer or employed, you are never sure 
of him. No bargain is firm, no engagement sacred, 
with such aman. Feeble as a reed before the boist- 
erous she-commander, he is bold in injustice towards 
those whom it pleases her caprice to mark out for 
 
-P-A-G-E-165
IV] TO A HUSBAND 163 
vengeance. In the eyes of neighbours, for friends 
such a man cannot have, in the eyes of servants, in 
the eyes of even the beggars at his door, such a man 
is a mean and despicable creature, though he may roll 
in wealth and possess great talents into the bargain. 
Such a man has, in fact, no property ; he has nothing 
that he can rightly call his own; he is a beggarly 
dependent under his own roof; and if he have any 
thing of the man left in him, and if there be rope or 
river near, the sooner he betakes him to the one or 
the other the better. How many men, how many 
families, have I known brought to utter ruin only by 
the husband suffering himself to be subdued, to be 
cowed down, to be held in fear, of even a virtuous 
wife! What, then, must be the lot of him who 
submits to a commander who, at the same time, sets 
all virtue at defiance ! 
185, Women are a sisterhood. They make common 
cause in behalf of the sea; and, indeed, this is 
natural enough, when we consider the vast power 
that the law gives us over them. The law is for us, 
and they combine, wherever they can, to mitigate its 
effects. This is perfectly natural, and, to a certain 
extent, laudable, evincing fellow-feeling and public 
spirit: but when carried to the length of ‘he sha’nt,’ 
it is despotism on the one side and slavery on the 
other. Watch, therefore, the incipient steps of en- 
croachment ; and they come on so slowly, so softly, 
that you must be sharp-sighted if you perceive them ; 
but the moment you do perceive them : your love will 
blind for too long a time; but the moment you do 
perceive them, put at once an effectual stop to their 
progress. Never mind the pain that it may give 
you: a day of pain at this time will spare you years 
of pain in time to come. Many a man has been 
miserable, and made his wife miserable too, for 3 
Ma

164 COBBETT’S ADVICE [Letter 
score or two of years, only for want of resolution to 
bear one day of pain: and it is a great deal to bear ; 
it is a great deal to do to thwart the desire of one 
whom you so dearly love, and whose virtues daily 
render her more and more dear to you. But (and 
this is one of the most admirable of the mother’s 
traits) as she herself will, while the tears stream from 
her eyes, force the nauseous medicine down the 
throat of her child, whose every cry is a dagger to 
her heart; as she herself has the courage to do this 
for the sake of her child, why should you flinch from 
the performance of a still more important and more 
sacred duty towards herself, as well as towards you 
and your children ? 
186, Am I recommending tyranny? Am I re- 
commending disregard of the wife’s opinions and 
wishes? Am I recommending a reserve towards her 
that would seem to say that she was not trust- 
worthy, or not a party interested in her husband's 
affairs? By no means: on the contrary, though I 
would keep any thing disagreeable from her, I should 
not enjoy the prospect of good without making her 
a participator. But reason says, and God has said, 
that it is the duty of wives to be obedient to their 
husbands; and the very nature of things prescribes 
that there must be @ head of every house, and an 
undivided authority. And then it is so clearly just 
that the authority should rest with him on whose 
head rests the whole responsibility, that a woman, 
when ‘patiently reasoned with on the subject, must 
be a virago in her very nature not to submit with 
docility to the terms of her marriage vow. 
187. There are, in almost every considerable 
neighbourhood, a little squadron of she-commanders, 
generally the youngish wives of old or weak-minded 
men, and generally without children. These are the
-P-A-G-E-167
IV] TO A HUSBAND 165 
tutoresses of the young wives of the vicinage; they, 
in virtue of their experience, not only school the 
wives, but scold the husbands ; they teach the former 
how to encroach and the latter how to yield: so 
that if you suffer this to go quietly on, you are soon 
under the care of a comité as completely as if you 
were insane. You want no comité: reason, law, 
religion, the marriage vow ; all these have made you 
head, have given you full power to rule your family, 
and if you give up your right, you deserve the 
contempt that assuredly awaits you, and also the 
ruin that is, in all probability, your doom. 
188. Taking it for granted that you will not 
suffer more than a second or third session of the 
female comité, let me say a word or two about the 
conduct of men in deciding between the conflicting 
opinions of husbands and wives. When a wife has 
a point to carry, and finds herself hard pushed, or 
when she thinks it necessary to call to her aid all 
the force she can possibly muster, one of her re- 
sources is, the vote on her side of all her husband’s 
visiting friends. ‘My husband thinks so and so, 
and I think so and so; now, Mr. Tomkins, don’t 
you think J am right?’ ‘To be sure he does; and so 
does Mr. Jenkins, and so does Wilkins, and so does 
Mr. Dickins, and you would swear that they were 
all her kins. Now this is very foolish, to say the 
least of it. None of these complaisant kins would 
like this in their own case. It is the fashion to say 
aye to all that a woman asserts, or contends for, 
especially in contradiction to her husband; and a 
very pernicious fashion it is. It is, in fact, not to 
pay her a compliment worthy of acceptance, but to 
treat her as an empty and conceited fool; and no 
sensible woman will, except from mere inadvertence, 
make the appeal. This fashion, however, foolish and
-P-A-G-E-168
166 COBBETT’S ADVICE [Letter 
contemptible as it is in itself, is attended, very fte- 
quently, with serious consequences. Backed by the 
opinions of her husband’s friends, the wife returns 
to the charge with redoubled vigour and obstinacy ; 
and if you do not yield, ten to one but a quarrel 
is the result; or, at least, something approaching 
towards it. A gentleman at whose house I was, 
about five years ago, was about to take a farm for 
his eldest ‘son, who was a very fine young man, 
about eighteen years old. The mother, who was as 
virtuous and as sensible a woman as I have ever 
known, wished him to be ‘in the law.’ There were 
six or eight intimate friends present, and all un- 
hesitatingly joined the lady, thinking it a pity that 
Haray, who had had ‘such a good education,’ should 
be buried in a farm-house. ‘And don’t you think 
so too, Mr. Cobbett,’ said the lady, with great 
earnestness, ‘Indeed, Ma’am,’ said I, ‘I should 
think it very great presumption in me to offer any 
opinion at al and especially in opposition to the 
known decision of the father, who is the best jud; 
and the only rightful judge, in such a case,’ This 
was a very sensible and well-behaved woman, and I 
still respect her very highly; but I could perceive 
that I instantly dropped out of her good graces. 
Harry, however, I was glad to hear, went ‘to. be 
buried in the farm-house.’ 
189, *A house divided against itself, or, rather, 
im itself, ‘cannot stand;’ and it is divided against 
itself if there be a divided authority. The wife 
ought to be heard, and patiently heard; she ought 
to be reasoned with, and, if possible, convinced ; but 
if, after all endeavours in this way, she remain 
opposed to the husband’s opinion, his will must be 
obeyed; or he, at once, becomes nothing; she is, 
in fact, the master, and he is nothing but an.
-P-A-G-E-169

insignificant inmate. As to matters of little com- 
parative moment; as to what shall be for dinner ; 
as to how the house shall be furnished; as to 
the management of the house and of menial ser- 
vants; as to these matters, and many others, the 
wife may have her way without any danger; but 
when the questions are, what is to be the calling to 
be pursued; what is to be the place of residence ; 
what is to be the style of living and scale of expence ; 
what is to be done with property; what the manner 
and place of educating children; what is to be their 
calling or state of life; who are to be employed or 
entrusted by the husband; what are the principles 
that he is to adopt as to public matters ; whom he 
is to have for coadjutors or friends; all these must 
be left solely to the husband; in all these he must 
have his will; or there never can be any harmony in 
the family. 
190. Nevertheless, in some of these concerns, wives 
should be heard with a great deal of attention, 
especially in the affairs of choosing your male ac- 
quaintances and friends and associates. Women are 
more quick-sighted than men ; they are less disposed 
to confide in persons upon a first acquaintance ; they 
are more suspicious as to motives; they are less 
liable to be deceived by professions and protesta- 
tions; they watch words with a more scrutinizing 
ear, and looks with a keener eye; and, making due 
allowance for their prejudices in particular cases, 
their opinions and remonstrances, with regard to 
matters of this sort, ought not to be set at naught 
without great deliberation. Louver, one of the 
Brissotins, who fled for their lives in the time of 
Rosesrierre; this Louver, in his narrative, en- 
titled ‘Mes Périls, and which I read, for the first 
time, to divert my mind from the perils of the

yellow-fever, in Philadelphia, but with which I was 
so captivated as to have read it many times since; 
this. writer, giving an account of his wonderfal 
dangers and escapes, relates, that being on his way 
to Paris from the vicinity of Bordeaux, and having 
no regular passport, fell lame, but finally crept on 
to a miserable pot-house, in a small town in the ~ 
Limosin. The landlord questioned him with regard - 
to who and what he was and whence he came and 
was satisfied with his answers. But the landlady, 
who had looked sharply at him on his arrival, 
whispered a little boy, who ran away, and quickly 
returned with the mayor of the town. Louver soon 
discovered that there was no danger in the mayor, 
who could not decipher his forged Passport, and who, 
being well plied with wine, wanted to hear no more 
of the matter. The landlady, perceiving this, slipped 
out and brought a couple of aldermen, who asked. 
to see the passport. *O, yes; but drink first. Then 
there was a laughing story to tell over again, at the 
request of the half-drunken mayor; then a laughing 
and more drinking; the passport in Lovver’s hand, 
but never opened, and, while another toast was drink- 
ing, the passport slid back quietly into the pocket ; 
the woman looking furious all the while. At last, 
the mayor, the aldermen, and the landlord, all nearly 
drunk, shook hands with Louver, and wished him a 
good journey, swore he was a true sans culotte; but, 
e says, that the ‘sharp-sighted woman, who was to 
be deceived by none of his stories or professions, saw 
him get off with deep and manifest disappointment 
and chagrin.” I have thought of this many times since, when I have had occasion to witness the quick- sightedness and penetration of women. The same quality that makes them, as they notoriously are, more quick in discovering expedients in cases of
-P-A-G-E-171
IV] TO A HUSBAND 169 
difficulty, makes them more apt to penetrate into 
motives and chai . 
191. I now come to a matter of the greatest 
possible importance; namely, that great troubler 
of the married state, that great bane of families, 
seaLousy; and I shall first speak of jealousy in the 
wife. This is always an unfortunate thing, and 
sometimes fatal, Yet, if there be a great propensity 
towards it, it is very difficult to be prevented. One 
thing, however, every husband can do in the way 
of prevention; and that is, to give no ground for it. 
And here, it is not sufficient that he strictly adhere 
to his marriage vow; he ought further to abstain 
from every art, however free from guilt, calculated 
to awaken the slightest degree of suspicion in a 
mind, the peace of which he is bound by every tie 
of justice and humanity not to disturb, or, if he can 
avoid it, to suffer it to be disturbed by others. A 
woman that is very fond of her husband, and this 
is the case with nine-tenths of English and American 
women, does not like to share with another any, 
even the smallest portion, not only of his affection, 
but of his assiduities and applause; and, as the 
bestowing of them on another, and receiving pay- 
ment in kind, can serve no purpose other than of 
gratifying one’s vanity, they ought to be abstained 
from, and especially if the gratification be to be 
purchased with even the chance of exciting uneasi- 
ness in her, whom it is your sacred duty to make as 
happy as you can. 
192. For about two or three years after I was 
married, I, retaining some of my military manners, 
used, both in France and America, to romp most 
famously with the girls that came in my way; till 
one day, at Philadelphia, my wife said to me, in a 
very gentle manner, ‘ Don’t do that: I do not like it,
-P-A-G-E-172
170 COBBETT’S ADVICE [Letter 
That was quite enough: I had never thought on the 
subject before: one hair of her head was more dear 
to me than all the other women in the world, and 
this I knew that she knew; but I now saw that this 
was not all that she had a right to from me; I saw, 
that she had the further claim upon me that I 
should abstain from every thing that might induce 
others to believe that there was any other woman 
for whom, even if I were at liberty, I had any 
affection. I beseech young married men to bear this 
in mind; for, on some trifle of this sort, the happi- 
ness or misery of a long life frequently turns. If 
the mind of a wife be disturbed on this score, every 
possible means ought to be used to restore it to 
peace; and though her suspicions be perfectly 
groundless; though they be wild as the dreams 
of madmen; though they may present a mixture of 
the furious and the ridiculous, still they are to be 
treated with the greatest lenity and tenderness ; and 
if, after all, you fail, the frailty is to be lamented as 
a misfortune, and not punished as a fault, seeing 
that it must have its foundation in a feeling towards 
you, which it would be the basest of ingratitude, 
and the most ferocious of cruelty, to repay by 
harshness of any description. 
193. As to those husbands who make the unjust 
suspicions of their wives a justification for making 
those suspicions just ; as to such as can make a sport . 
of such suspicions, rather brag of them than other- 
wise, and endeavour to aggravate rather than assuage 
them ; as to such I have nothing to say, they being 
far without the scope of any advice that I can offer. But to such as are not of this description, I have 
a remark or two to offer with respect to measures of prevention. 
194, And, first, I never could see the sense of its
-P-A-G-E-173
Iv] TO A HUSBAND 171 
being a piece of etiquette, a sort of mark of good 
breeding, to make ita rule that man and wife are 
not to sit side by side in a mixed company; that if 
a y walk out, the wife is to give her arm to some 
other than her husband; that if there be any other 
hand near, his is not to help to a seat or into a car- 
riage. I never could see the sense of this; but I have 
always seen the nonsense of it plainly enough; it is, 
in short, amongst many other foolish and mischievous 
things that we do in aping the manners of those 
whose riches (frequently Ai-gotten) and whose power 
embolden them to set, with impunity, pernicious 
examples; and to their examples this nation owes 
more of its degradation in morals than to any other 
source. The truth is, that this is a piece of false 
refinement : it, being interpreted, means, that so free 
are the parties from a liability to suspicion, so 
innately virtuous and pure are they, that each man 
can safely trust his wife with another man, and each 
woman her husband with another woman. But this 
piece of false refinement, like all others, overshoots 
its mark; it says too much; for it says that the 
parties have lewd thoughts in their minds, This is 
not the fact, with regard to people in general; but 
it must have been the origin of this set of consum- 
mately ridiculous and contemptible rules. 
195. Now I would advise a young man, especially 
if he have a pretty wife, not to commit her unneces- 
sarily to the care of any other man; not to be 
separated from her in this studious and ceremonious 
manner; and not to be ashamed to prefer her com- 
pany and conversation to that of any other woman. 
never could discover any good-breeding in setting 
another man, almost expressly, to poke his nose up 
in the face of my wife, and talk nonsense to her ; 
for, in such cases, nonsense it generally is. It is not
-P-A-G-E-174
172 COBBETT’S ADVICE [Letter 
a thing of much consequence, to be sure; but when 
the wife is young, especially, it is not seemly, at any 
rate, and it cannot possibly lead to any good, thoug) : 
it may not lead to any great evil. And, on the 
other hand, you may be quite sure that, whatever she 
may scem to think of the matter, she will not like 
you the better for your attentions of this sort to 
other women, especially if they be young and hand- 
some: and as this species of fashionable nonsense can 
do you no good, why gratify your love of talk, or the 
vanity of any woman, at even the risk of exciting 
uneasiness in that mind of which it is your most 
sacred duty to preserve, if you can, the uninterrupted 
tranquillity. 
196. The truth is, that the greatest security of all 
against jealousy in a wife is to show, to prove, by 
your acts, by your words also, but more especially by 
your acis, that you prefer her to all the world; and, 
as I said before, I vnow of no act that is, in this 
respect, equal to spending in her com every 
moment of your leisure time. Every body. knows, 
and young wives better than any body else, that 
people, who. can choose, will be where they like best 
to be, and that they will be along with those whose 
company they best like. The matter is very plain, 
then, and I do beseech you to bear it in mind. Nor 
do I'see the use, or sense, of keeping a great deal of 
company, as it is called. What company can a young 
man and woman want more than their two selves, 
and their children, if they have any? If here be not 
company enough, it is but a sad affair. The per- 
nicious cards are brought forth by the company- 
keeping, the rival expenses, the sittings up late at 
night, the seeing of “the ladies home, and a thousand 
squabbles and disagreeable consequences. But, the 
great thing of all is, that this hankering after com-
-P-A-G-E-175
IV] TO A HUSBAND 173 
any, proves, clearly proves, that you want something 
Seyond the society of your wife ; and that she is sure 
to feel most acutely: the bare fact contains an 
imputation against her, and it is pretty sure to la 
the foundation of jealousy, or of something sti 
worse. 
197. If acts of kindness in you are necessary in all 
cases, they are especially so in cases of her illness, 
from whatever cause arising. I will not suppose 
myself to be addressing any husband capable of being 
unconcerned while his wife’s life is in the most distant 
danger from illness, though it has been my very great 
mortification to know in my life time, two or three 
brutes of this description; but, far short of this 
degree of brutality, a great deal of fault may be 
committed. When men are ill, they feel every neglect 
with double anguish, and, what then must be in such 
cases the feelings of women, whose ordinary feelings 
are so much more acute than those of men; what 
must be their feelings in case of neglect in illness, 
and especially if the neglect come the husband ! 
Your own heart will, I hope, tell you what those 
feelings must be, and will spare me the vain attempt 
to describe them ; and, if it do thus instruct you, you 
will want no arguments from me to induce you, at 
such a season, to prove the sincerity of your affection 
by every kind word and kind act that your mind can 
suggest. This is the time to try you; and, be you 
assured, that the impression left on her mind now 
will be the true and lasting impression ; and, if it be 
good, will be a better preservative against her being 
jealous, than ten thousand of your professions ten 
thousand times repeated. In such a case, you ought 
to spare no expense that you can possibly afford ; 
you ought to neglect nothing that your means will 
enable you to do; for, what is the use of money if it
-P-A-G-E-176
174 COBBETT’S ADVICE [Letter 
be not to be expended in this case? But, more than 
all the rest, is your own personal attention. This is 
the valuable thing; this is the great balm to the 
sufferer, and, it is efficacious in proportion as it is 
proved to be sincere. Leave nothing to other hands 
that you can do yourself; the mind has a great deal 
to do in all the ailments of the body, and, bear in 
mind, that, whatever be the event, you have a more 
than ample reward. I cannot press this point too 
strongly upon you; the bed of sickness presents no 
charms, no allurements, and women know this well; 
they watch, in such a case, your every word and 
every look: and now it is that their confidence is 
secured, or their suspicions excited, for life. 
198. In conclusion of these remarks, as to jealousy 
in a wife, I cannot help expressing my abhorrence of 
those husbands who treat it as a matter for ridicule. 
To be sure, infidelity in a man is less heinous than 
infidelity in the wife; but still, is the marriage vow 
nothing? Is a promise solemnly made before God, 
and in the face of the world, nothing? Isa violation 
of a contract, and that, too, with a fecbler party, 
nothing of which a man ought to be ashamed? But, 
besides all these, there is the cruelty. First, you win, 
by great pains, perhaps, a woman’s affections; then, 
in order to get possession of her person, you marry 
her ; then, after enjoyment, you break your vow, you 
bring upon her the mixed pity and jeers of the world, 
and thus yu leave her to weep out her life. Murder 
is more horrible than this, to be sure, and the 
criminal law, which punishes divers other crimes, does not reach this ; but, in the eye of reason and of moral justice, it is surpassed b very few of those 
crimes, Passion may be pleaded, and so it may, for 
almost every other crime of which man can be guilty. It is “not a crime against nature; nor are any of
-P-A-G-E-177
IV} TO A HUSBAND 1% 
these which men commit in consequence of their 
necessities, The temptation is great; and is not the 
temptation great when men thieve or rob? In short, 
there is no excuse for an act so unjust and so cruel, 
and the world is just as to this matter; for, I have 
always observed, that, however men are disposed to 
laugh at these breaches of vows in men, the act 
seldom fails to produce injury to the whole character ; 
it leaves, after all the joking, a stain, and, amongst 
those who depend on character for a livelihood, it 
often produces ruin. At the very least, it makes an 
unhappy and wrangling family; it makes children 
despise or hate their fathers, and it affords an example 
at the thought of the ultimate consequences of which 
a father ought to shudder. In such a case, children 
will take part, and they ought to take part, with the 
mother : she is the injured party; the shame brought 
upon her attaches, in part, to them: they feel the 
injustice done them; and, if such a man, when 
the grey hairs, and tottering knees, and piping voice 
come, look round him in vain for a prop, let him, at 
last, be just, and acknowledge that he has now the 
due reward of his own wanton cruelty to one whom 
he had solemnly sworn to love and to cherish to the 
last hour of his or her life. 
199. But, bad as is conjugal infidelity in the hus- 
band, it is much worse in the wife: a proposition 
that it is necessary to maintain by the force of reason, 
because the women, as a sisterhood, are prone to deny 
the truth of it. They say that adultery is adultery, 
in men as well as in them; and that, therefore, the 
offence is as great in the one case as in the other. 
As a crime, abstractedly considered, it certainly is; 
but, as to the consequences, there is a wide difference. 
In both cases, there is the breach of a solemn yow, 
but, there is this great distinction, that the husband,
-P-A-G-E-178
176 COBBETT’S ADVICE [Letter 
by his breach of that vow, only brings shame upon 
his wife and family ; whereas the wife, by a breach of 
her vow, may bring the husband a spurious offspring 
to maintain, and may bring that spurious offspring 
to rob of their fortunes, and in some cases of their 
bread, her legitimate children. So that here isa great _ 
and evident wrong done to numerous parties, besides ” 
the deeper disgrace inflicted in this case than in the 
other. 
200. And why is the disgrace deeper? Because 
here is a total want of delicacy; here is, in fact, 
prostitution ; here is grossness and filthiness of mind ; 
here is every thing that argues baseness of character, 
Women should be, and they are, except in few 
instances, far more reserved and more delicate than 
men; nature bids them be such; the habits and 
manners of the world confirm this precept of nature ; 
and therefore, when they commit this offence, they 
excite loathing, as well as call for reprobation. In 
the countries where a plurality of wives is permitted, 
there is no plurality of husbands, It is there thought 
not at all indelicate for a man to have several wives ; 
but the bare thought of a woman having wo husbands 
would excite horror. The widows of the Hindoos 
burn themselves in the pile that consumes their hus- 
bands; but the Hindoo widowers do not dispose of 
themselves in this way. The widows devote their 
bodies to complete destruction, lest, even after -the 
death of their husbands, they should be tempted to 
connect themselves with other men; and though this 
is carrying delicacy far indeed, it reads to Christian 
wives a lesson not unworthy of their attention ; for, 
though it is not desirable that their bodies should be 
turned into handfuls of ashes, even that transmuta- 
tion were preferable to that infidelity which fixes the brand of shame on the cheeks of their parents,
-P-A-G-E-179
IV] TO A HUSBAND 177 
their children, and on those of all who ever called 
them friend. 
201. For these plain and forcible reasons it is that 
this species of offence is far more heinous in the wife 
than in the husband ; and the people of all civilized 
countries act upon this settled distinction. Men who 
have been guilty of the offence are not cut off from 
society, but women who have been guilty of it are; 
for, as we all know well, no woman, married or single, 
of fair reputation, will risk that reputation by being 
ever seen, if she can avoid it, with a woman who has 
ever, at any time, committed this offence, which con- 
tains in itself, and by universal award, a sentence of 
social excommunication for life. 
202. If, therefore, it be the duty of the husband 
to adhere strictly to his marriage vow: if his breach 
of that vow be naturally attended with the fatal conse- 
quences above described : how much more imperative 
is the duty on the wife to avoid, even the semblance of 
a deviation from that vow! If the man’s misconduct, 
in this respect, bring shame on so many innocent 
parties, what shame, what dishonour, what misery fol- 
Jow such misconduct in the wife! Her parents, those 
of her husband, all her relations, and al her friends, 
share in her dishonour, And her children! how is 
she to make atonement to them! They are com- 
manded to honour their father and their mother; 
but not such a mother as this, who, on the contrary, 
has no claim to any thing from them but hatred, 
abhorrence, and execration, It is she who has broken 
the ties of nature; she has dishonoured her own off- 
spring ; she has fixed a mark of reproach on those 
who once made a part of her own bot ; nature shuts 
her out of the pale of its influence, and condemns her 
to the just detestation of those whom it formerly 
bade love her as their own life.

203. But as the crime is so much more heinous, 
and the punishment so much more severe, in the case 
of the wife than it is in the case of the husband, so 
the caution ought to be greater in making the accusa~ 
tion, or entertaining the suspicion. Men ought -te 
be very slow in entertaining such suspicions: they 
ought to have clear proof before they can suspect} 
a proneness to such suspicions is a very unfortunate 
turn of the mind; and, indeed, few characters aré 
more despicable than that of a jealous-headed hus- 
band; rather than be tied to the whims of one.of 
whom, an innocent woman of spirit would earn her 
bread over the washing-tub, or with a hay-fork, of 
a reap-hook. With such a man there can be no 
peace; and, as far as children are concerned, the false 
accusation is nearly equal to the reality. When 
a wife discovers. her jealousy, she merely imputes to’ 
her husband inconstancy and breach of his marriage 
vow; but jealousy in him imputes to her a willing- 
ness to palm a spurious offspring upon him, and 
upon her legitimate children, as robbers of their 
birthright ; and, besides this, grossness, filthiness, and 
prostitution. She imputes to him injustice and 
cruelty: but he imputes to her that which banishes 
her from society ; that which cuts her off for life from 
every thing connected with female purity; that which 
brands her with infamy to her latest breath. 
_ 204, Very slow, therefore, ought a husband to be 
in entertaining even the thought of this crime in his 
wife. He ought to be quite sure before he take the smallest step in the way of accusation; but if un- happily he have the proof, no consideration on earth ought to induce him to cohabit with her one moment 
longer. Jealous husbands are not despicable because 
they have. grounds; but because they have not 
3 and this..is. generally. the case. When
-P-A-G-E-181
IV] TO A HUSBAND 179 
they have grounds, their own honour commands 
them to cast off the object, as they would cut out 
acorn or a cancer. It is not the jealousy in itself, 
which is despicable ; but the continuing to live in that 
state. It is no dishonour to be a slave in Algiers, 
for instance; the dishonour begins only where you 
remain a slave voluntarily; it begins the moment 
you can escape from slavery, and do not. It is 
despicable unjustly to be jealous of your wife ; but 
it is infamy to cohabit with her if you know her to 
be guilty. 
205. I shall be told that the daw compels you to 
live with her, unless you be rich enough to disengage 
yourself from her ; but the law does not compel you 
to remain in the same country with her; and, if a man 
have no other means of ridding himself of such 
a curse, what are mountains or seas or traverse? 
And what is the risk (if such there be) of exchanging 
a life of bodily ease for a life of labour? What are 
these, and numerous other ills (if they happen) 
superadded? Nay, what is death itself, compared 
with the baseness, the infamy, the never-ceasing 
shame and reproach of living under the same roof 
with a prostituted woman, and calling her your wife ? 
But, there are children, and what are to become of 
these? To be taken away from the prostitute, to be 
sure; and this is a duty which you owe to them: 
the sooner they forget her the better, and the farther 
they are from her, the sooner that will be. There 
is no excuse for continuing to live with an adultress ; 
no inconvenience, no loss, no suffering, ought to 
deter a man from delivering himself from such a state 
of filthy infamy ; and to suffer his children to remain 
in such a state, is a crime that hardly admits of 
adequate description; a jail is’ paradise compared 
with such a life, and he who can endure this latter, 
na
-P-A-G-E-182

from the fear of encountering hardship, is a wretch 
too despicable to go by the name of man. 
206.. But, now, all this supposes, that the husband 
has well and truly acted his part! It suppores, not 
only that he has been faithful ; but, that he has not, 
in any way, been the cause of temptation to the wife 
to be unfaithful. If he have been cold and neglect- 
ful ; if he have led a life of irregularity; if he have 
roved to her that home was not his delight ; if he 
ave made his house the place of resort for loose 
companions; if he have given rise to a taste for 
visiting, junketting, parties of pleasure and gaiety ; 
if he have introduced. the habit of indulging in what 
are called ‘innocent freedoms ;’ if these, or any of 
these, the fault is his, he must take the consequences, 
and he has no right to inflict punishment on the 
offender, the offence being in fact of his own creating. 
The laws of God, as well as the laws of man, have 
given him all power in this respect: it is for him to 
use that power for the honour of his wife as well as 
for that of himself: if he neglect to use it, all the 
consequences ought to fall on him; and, as far as 
my observation has gone, in nineteen out of twenty 
cases of infidelity in wives, the crimes have been 
Sairly ascribable to the husbands. Folly or miscon- 
duct in the husband, cannot, indeed, justify or even 
palliate infidelity in the wife, whose very nature 
ought to make her recoil at the thought of the 
offence ; but it may, at the same time, deprive him 
of the right of inflicting punishment on her: her 
kindred, her children, and the world, will justly hold 
her in abhorrence; but the husband must hold his 
peace, : 
207. ‘Innocent freedoms !? | know of none that 
a wife can indulge in. The words, as applied to the 
demeanour of a married woman, or even a single one,
-P-A-G-E-183
IV] TO A HUSBAND 181 
imply a contradiction. For freedom, thus used, 
means an exemption or departure from the sérict 
rules of female reserve ; and, 1 do not see how this 
can be innocent, It may not amount to crime, 
indeed ; but, still it is not innocent ; and the use of 
the phrase is dangerous. If it had been my fortune to 
be yoked to a person, who liked ‘ innocent freedoms,’ 
I should have unyoked myself in a very short time. 
But, to say the truth, it is all a man’s own fault: 
If he have not sense and influence enough to prevent 
‘innocent freedoms, even before marriage, he will do 
well to let the thing alone, and leave wives to be 
managed by those who have. But, men will talk to 
your wife, and flatter her. To be sure they will, 
if she be young and pretty; and would you go and 
pull her away from them? O no, by no means; but 
you must have very little sense, or must have made 
very little use of it, if her manner do not soon 
convince them that they employ their flattery in 
vain. 
208, So much of a man’s happiness and of his 
efficiency through life depends upon his mind being 
quite free from all anxieties of this sort, that too 
much care cannot be taken to guard against them ; 
and, I repeat, that the great preservation of all is, 
the young couple living as much as possible at home, 
and having as few visitors as possible. If they do 
not prefer the company of each other to that of all 
the world besides ; if either of them be weary of the 
company of the other; if they do not, when separated 
by business or any other cause, think with pleasure 
of the time of meeting again, it is a omen. 
Pursue this course when young, and the very thought 
of jealousy will never come into your mind; and, if 
you do pursue it, and show by your deeds that you 
value your wife as you do your own life, you must be

pretty nearly ani idiot, if she do not think you-to be 
the wisest man in the world, The best man she will 
be sure to think you, and she will never forgive 
any one that calls your talents or your wisdom in 
question. 
209. Now, will you say that, if to be happy, nay, 
if to avoid misery and ruin in the married state, 
requires all these precautions, all these cares, to fail 
* to any extent in any of which is to bring down on a 
man’s head such fearful consequences; will you say 
that, if this be the case, it is better to remain single? 
If you should say this, it is my business to show that 
you are in error. For, in the first place, it is against 
nature to suppose that children can cease to be born; 
they must and will come; and then it follows, that 
they must come by promiscuous intercourse, or by 
particular connexion. ‘The former nobody will con- 
tend for, seeing that it would put us, in this respect, 
on a level with the brute creation. Then, as the con- 
nexion is to be particular, it must be during pleasure, 
or for the joint lives of the parties. The former 
would seldom hold for any length of time: the tie 
would seldom be durable, and it would be feeble on 
account of its uncertain duration. Therefore, to be 
a father, with all the lasting and delightful ties 
attached to the name, you must first be a husband ; 
and there are very few men in the world who do not, 
first or last, desire to be fathers. If it be said, that 
marriage ought not to be for life, but that its 
duration ought to be subject to the will, the mutual 
will at least, of the ‘ies; the answer is, that it 
would seldom be of long duration. Every trifling 
dispute would lead to a separation; a hasty word would be enough. Knowing that the engagement 
is for life, prevents disputes too; it checks anger in 
its beginnings. Put a rigging horse ‘into a field

with a weak fence, and with captivating pasture on 
the other side, and he is continually trying to get 
out; but, let the field be walled round, he makes 
the best of his hard fare, and divides his time between 
grazing and sleeping. Besides, there could be no 
families, no assemblages of persons worthy of that 
name; all would be confusion and indescribable 
intermixture: the names of brother and sister would 
hardly have a meaning; and, therefore, there must 
be marriage, or there can be nothing worthy of the 
name of family or of father. 
210, The cares and troubles of the married life are 
many ; but, are those of the single life few? Take 
the farmer, and it is nearly the same with the trades- 
man; but, take the farmer, for instance, and let him, 
at the age of twenty-five, go into business unmarried. 
See his maid servants, probably rivals for his smiles, 
but certainly rivals in the charitable distribution 
of his victuals and drink amongst those of their own 
rank: behold their guardianship of his pork-tub, his 
bacon rack, his butter, cheese, milk, poultry, eggs, 
and all the rest of it: look at their care of all his 
household stuff, his blankets, sheets, pillow-cases, 
towels, knives and forks, and particularly of his 
crockery ware, of which last they will hardly exceed. 
a single cart-load of broken bits in the year. And, 
how nicely they will get up and take care of his 
linen and other wearing apparel, and always have it 
ready for him without his thinking about it! If 
absent at market, or especially at a distant fair, how 
scrupulously they will Keep all their cronies out of 
his house, and what special care they will take of his 
cellar, more particularly that which holds the strong 
beer! And his groceries and his spirits and his wine 
(for a bachelor can afford it), how safe these will 
all be! Bachelors have not, indeed, any more than

married men, a security for health; but if our young 
farmer be sick, there are his couple of maids to take 
care of him, to administer his medicine, and to 
perform for him all other nameless offices, which in 
such a case are required ; and what is more, take care 
of every thing down stairs at the same time, especially 
his desk with the money in it! Never will they, 
good-humoured girls as they are, scold him for 
coming home too late ; but, on the contrary, like him 
the better for it; and if he have drunk a little too 
much, so much the better, for then he will sleep late 
in the morning, and when he comes out at last, he 
will find that his men have been so hard at work, 
and that all his animals have been taken such good 
care of ! 
211. Nonsense! a bare glance at the thing shows, 
that a farmer, above all men living, can never carry 
on his affairs with profit without a wife, or a mother, 
or a daughter, or some such person ; and mother and 
daughter imply matrimony. To be sure, a wife 
would cause some trouble, perhaps, to this young man. 
There might be the midwife and nurse to gallop 
after at midnight; there might be, and there ought 
to be, if called for, a little complaining of late hours ; 
but, good God! what are these, and all the other 
troubles that could attend a married life; what are 
they, compared to the one single circumstance of the 
want of a wife at your bedside during one single 
night of illness! A nurse! what is a nurse to do for

wishes? Will she use the urgent persuasions so often 
necessary to save life in such cases? Will she, by 
her acts, convince you that it is not a toil, but a 
delight, to break her rest for your sake? In short, now it is that you find that what the women them-
-P-A-G-E-187
Ivj TO A HUSBAND 185 
selves say is strictly true, namely, that without wives, 
men are poor helpless mortals. 
212. As to the empense, there is no comparison 
between that of a woman servant and a wife, in the 
house of a farmer or a tradesman. The wages of 
the former is not the expense; it is the want of a 
common interest with you, and this you can obtain 
in no one but a wife. But there are the children. 
I, for my part, firmly believe that a farmer, married 
at twenty-five, and ‘having ten children during the 
first ten years, would be able to save more money 
during these years, than a bachelor, of the same age, 
would be able to save, on the same farm, in a like 
space of time, he keeping only one maid servant. 
One single fit of illness, of two months’ duration, 
might sweep away more than all the children would 
cost in the whole ten years, to say nothing of the 
continual waste and pillage, and the idleness, going 
on from the first day of the ten years to the last. 
213. Besides, is the money all? What a life 
to lead!! No one to talk to without going from 
home, or without getting some one to come to you; 
no friend to sit and talk to: pleasant evenings to 
pass! Nobody to share with you your sorrows or 
your pleasures: no soul having a common interest 
with you: all around you taking care of themselves, 
and no care of you: no one to cheer you in moments 
of depression: to say all in a word, no one to love 
you, and no prospect of ever seeing any such one to 
the end of your days. For, as to parents and 
brethren, if you have them, they have other and 
very different ties; and, however laudable your 
feelings as son and brother, those feelings are of 
a different character. Then as to gratifications, from 
which you will hardly abstain altogether, are they 
generally of little expense? and are they attended
-P-A-G-E-188
186 COBBETT’S ADVICE [Letter 
with no trouble, no vexation, no disappointment, no 
Jealousy even, and are they never followed by shame 
or remorse ? 
214, It does very well in bantering songs, to say 
that the bachelor’s life is ‘devoid of care” My 
observation tells me the contrary, and reason con- 
curs, in this regard, with experience. The bachelor 
has no one on whom he can in all cases rely. When 
he quits his home, he carries with him cares that are 
unknown to the married man. If, indeed, like the 
common soldier, he have merely a lodging-place, and 
a, bundle of clothes, given in charge to some one, he 
may be at his ease; but if he possess any thing of 
a home, he is never sure of its safety; and this un- 
certainty is a great enemy to cheerfulness. And as 
to efficiency in life, how is the bachelor to equal the 
married man? In the case of farmers and tradesmen, 
the latter have so clearly the advantage over the 
former, that one need hardly insist upon the point; 
but it is, and must be, the same in all the situations 
of life. To provide for a wife and children is the 
greatest of all possible spurs to exertion. Many 
a man, naturally prone to idleness, has become active 
and industrious when he saw children growing up 
about him; many a dull sluggard has become, if not 
a bright man, at least a bustling man, when roused 
to exertion by his love. Dryden's account of the 
change wrought in Cymon, is only a strong case of 
the kind. And, indeed, if a man will not exert 
himself for the sake of a wife and children, he can 
have no exertion in him; or he must be deaf to all 
the dictates of nature. 
215. Perhaps the world never exhibited a more striking proof of the truth of this doctrine than that which is exhibited in me; and I am sure that eve 
one will say, without any hesitation, that a fourth
-P-A-G-E-189

part of the labours I- have performed, never would 
have been performed, if I had not been a married 
man, Yn the first place, they could not ; for I should, 
all the early part of my life, have been rambling and 
roving about as most bachelors are. I should have 
had no home that I cared a straw about, and should 
have wasted the far greater part of my time. The 
great affair of home being settled, having the home 
secured, I had leisure to employ my mind on things 
which it delighted in. I got rid at once of all cares, 
all anaieties, and had only to provide for the very 
moderate wants of that home. But the children 
began to come. They sharpened my industry: they 
spurred me on. To be sure, I had other and strong 
motives: I wrote for fame, and was urged forward 
by ill-treatment, and by the desire to triumph over 
my enemies ; but, after all, a very large part of my 
nearly a hundred volumes may be fairly ascribed to 
the wife and children. 
216. I might have done something ; but, perhaps, 
not a thousandth part of what I have done; not even 
a thousandth part: for the chances are, that. I, being 
fond of a military life, should have ended my days 
ten or twenty years ago, in consequence of wounds, 
or fatigue, or, more likely, in consequence of the 
persecutions of some haughty and insolent fool, whom 
nature had formed to black my shoes, and whom 
a system of corruption had made my commander. 
Love came and rescued me from this state of horrible 
slavery; placed the whole of my time at my own 
disposal; made me as free as air; removed every 
restraint upon the operations of my mind, naturally 
disposed to communicate its thoughts to others; and 
gave me, for my leisure hours, a companion, who, 
though deprived of all opportunity of acquiring 
what is called learning, bad so much good sense, so
-P-A-G-E-190

much useful knowledge, was so innocent, so just in 
all her ways, so pure in thought, word and deed, so 
disinterested, so generous, so devoted to me and her 
children, so free from all disguise, and, withal, so 
beautiful and so talkative, and in a voice so sweet, 
so cheering, that I must, seeing the health and the 
capacity which it had pleased God to give me, have 
been a criminal, if I had done much less than that 
which I have done; and I have always said, that, 
if my country feel any gratitude for my labours, 
that gratitude is due to her full as much as to me. 
217. ‘Care’! What care have I known! I have 
been buffeted about by this powerful and vindictive 
Government; I have repeatedly had the fruit of my 
labour snatched away from me by it; but I had 
a partner that never frowned, that was never melan- 
choly, that never was subdued in spirit, that never 
abated a smile, on these occasions, that fortified me, 
and sustained me by her courageous example, and 
that was just as busy and as zealous in taking care 
of the remnant as she had been in taking care of the 
whole; just as cheerful, and just as full of caresses, 
when brought down to a mean hired lodging, as when 
the mistress of a fine country house, with all its 
accompaniments; and, whether from her words or 
her looks, no one could gather that she regretted 
the change. What ‘cares’ have I had, then? What 
have I had worthy of the name of ‘ cares” ? 
218, And, how is it now? How is it when the 
sixty-fourth year has come? And how should I have 
been without this wife and these children? I might 
have amassed a tolerable heap of money; but what 
would that have done for me? It might have bought 
me plenty of professions of attachment; plenty of persons impatient for my exit from the world ; but 
not one single grain of sorrow, for any anguish that
-P-A-G-E-191
IV] TO A HUSBAND 189 
might have attended my approaching end. 'To me, 
no being in this world appears so wretched as an 
Old Bachelor. ‘Those circumstances, those changes 
in his person and in his mind, which, in the husband, 
increase rather than diminish the attentions to him, 
produce all the want of feeling attendant on disgust ; 
and he beholds, in the conduct of the mercenary 
crew that generally surround him, little besides an 
eager desire to profit from that event, the approach of 
which, nature makes a subject of sorrow with him. 
219. Before I quit this part of my work, I cannot 
refrain from offering my opinion with regard to what 
is due from husband to wife, when the disposal of 
his property comes to be thought of. When marriage 
is an affair settled by deeds, contracts, and lawyers, 
the hushand, being bound beforehand, has really no 
will to make. But where he has a will to make, 
and a faithful wife to leave behind him, it is his 
first duty to provide for her future well-being, to 
the utmost off his power. If she brought him no 
money, she brought him her person ; and by deliver- 
ing that up to him, she established a claim to his 
careful protection of her to the end of her life. 
Some men think, or act as if they thought, that, 
if a wife bring no money, and if the husband gain 
money by his business or profession, that money 
is his, and not hers, because she has not been doing 
any of those things for which the money has been 
received. But is this way of thinking just? By the 
marriage vow, the husband endows the wife with all 
his wordly goods; and not a bit too much is this, 
when she is giving him the command and possession 
of her person. But does she not help to acquire 
the money? Speaking, for instance, of the farmer 
or the merchant, the wife does not, indeed, go to 
plough, or to look after the ploughing and sowing ;
-P-A-G-E-192
190 COBBETT’S ADVICE [Letter 
she does not purchase or sell the stock; she does not 
go to the fair or the market; but she enables 
him to do all these without injury to his affairs at 
home; she is the guardian of his property; she 
reserves what would otherwise be lost to him. The 
mm and the granary, though they create nothing, 
have, in the bringing of food to our mouths, as much 
merit as the fields themselves. The wife does not, 
indeed, assist in the merchant’s counting-house ; she 
does not go upon the exchange; she does not even 
know what he is doing; but she keeps his house in 
order; she rears up his children; she provides a 
scene of suitable resort for his friends; she insures 
him a constant retreat from the fatigues of his 
affairs ; she makes his home pleasant, and she is the 
guardian of his income. 
220. In both these cases, the wife helps to gain the 
money ; and in cases where there is no gain, where 
the income is by descent, or is fixed, she helps to 
prevent it from being squandered away. It is, 
therefore, as much hers as it is the husband’s; and 
though the law gives him, in many cases, the power 
of keeping her share from her, no just man will ever 
avail himself of that power. With regard to the 
tying up of widows from marrying again, I will relate 
what took place in a case of this kind, in America. 
A merchant, who had, during his married state, 
risen from poverty to very great riches, and. who 
had, nevertheless, died at about forty years of age, 
left the whole of his property to his wife for her 
life, and at her disposal at her death, provided that 
she did not marry. -The consequence was, that she 
took a husband without marrying, and, at her death 
(she having no. children), gave the whole of. the 
property to the seeond husband!. So much. for 
posthumous jealousy! =... - .
-P-A-G-E-193
IV] TO A HUSBAND 191 
221. Where there are children, indeed, it is the 
duty of the husband to provide, in certain cases, 
against step-fathers, who are very prone not to be 
the most just and affectionate parents. It is an 
unhappy circumstance, when a dying father is com- 
pelled to have fears of this sort. There is seldom 
an apology to be offered for a mother that will 
hazard the happiness of her children by a second 
marriage... The Jaw allows it, to be sure; but there 
is, as Prior says, ‘something beyond the letter of 
the law. I know what ticklish ground I am tread- 
ing on here; but, though it is as lawful for a 
woman to take a second husband as for a man to 
take a second wife, the cases are different, and widely 
different, in the eye of morality and of reason; for, 
as adultery in the wife is a greater offence than 
adultery in the husband; as it is more gross, as it 
includes prostitution; so a second marriage in the 
woman is more gross than in the man, argues great 
deficiency in that delicacy, that innate modesty, 
which, after all, is the great charm, the charm of 
charms, in the female sex. I do not &ke to hear 
a man talk of his first wife, especially in the presence 
of a second; but to hear a woman thus talk of her 
Jirst husband, has never, however beautiful and good 
she might be, failed to sink her in my estimation. 
I have, in such cases, never been able to keep out of 
my mind that concatenation of ideas, which, in spite 
of custom, in spite of the frequency of the occur- 
rence, leave an impression deeply disadvantageous 
to the party; for, after the greatest of ingenuity 
has exhausted itself in the way of apology, it comes 
to this at last, that the person has @ second time. 
undergone that surrender, to which nothing but the 
most ardent affection, could ever reconcile a chaste 
and delicate woman. _.
-P-A-G-E-194

222. The usual apologies, that ‘a lone woman 
wants a protector ; that she cannot manage her estate ; 
that she cannot carry on her business ; that she wants 
a home for her children’ ; all these apologies are not 
worth a straw; for what is the amount of them? 
Why, that she surrenders her person to secure these 
ends! And if we admit the validity of such apo- 
logies, are we far from apologising for the kept~ 
mistress, and even the prostitute? Nay, the former 
of these may (if she confine herself to one man) plead 
more boldly in her defence ; and even the latter may 
lead that hunger, which knows no law, and no 
lecorum, and no delicacy. These unhappy, but 
justly-reprobated and despised parties, are allowed no 
apology at all: though reduced to the begging of 
their bread, the wrorld grants them no excuse. The 
sentence on them is: ‘You shall suffer every hard- 
ship ; you shall submit to hunger and nakedness ; you 
shall perish by the way-side, rather than you shall 
su your person to the dishonour of the female 
sex. But can we, without crying injustice, pass this 
sentence upon them, and, at the same time hold it to 
be proper, decorous, and delicate, that widows shall 
surrender their persons for worldly gain, for the sake 
of ease, or for any consideration whatsoever ? 
223, It is disagreeable to contemplate the possi- 
bility of cases of separation; but amongst the evils 
of life, such have occurred, and will occur; and the 
injured parties, while they are sure to meet with the 
pity of all just persons, must console themselves that 
they have not merited their fate. In the making one’s choice, no human foresight or prudence can, in 
all cases, guard against an unhappy result. There is one species of usbands to be occasionally met 
with in all countries, meriting particular reprobation, and causing us to lament, that. there is no law ta

punish offenders so enormous. There was a man in 
Pennsylvania, apparently a very amiable young man, 
having a good estate of his own, and marrying a 
most beautiful woman of his own age, of rich parents, 
and of virtue perfectly spotless. He very soon took 
to both gaming and drinking (the last being the 
most fashionable vice of the country); he neglected 
his affairs and his family ; in about four years spent 
his estate, and became a dependent on his wife’s 
father, together with his wife and three children. 
Even this would have been of little consequence, as 
far as related to expense ; but he led the most scan- 
dalous life, and was incessant in his demands of 
money for the purposes of that infamous life. All 
sorts of means were resorted to to reclaim him, and all 
in vain ; and the wretch, availing himself of the plead- 
ing of his wife’s affection, and of his power over the 
children more especially, continued for ten or twelve 
years to plunder the parents, and to disgrace those 
whom it was his bounden duty to assist in making 
happy. At last, going out in the dark, in a boat, 
ant being partly drunk, he went to the bottom of 
the Delaware, and became food for otters or fishes, to 
the great joy of all who knew him, excepting only 
his amiable wife. I can form an idea of no baseness 
equal to this. There is more of baseness in this 
character than in that of the robber, The man 
who obtains the means of indulging in vice, by 
robbery, exposes himself to the inflictions of the 
law ; but though he merits punishment, he merits it 
less than the base miscreant who obtains his means 
by his threats to disgrace his own wife, children, and 
the wife's parents. ‘The short way in such a case,” 
is the best ; set the wretch at.defiante ; resort to the 
strong arm of the law wherever it will avail you; 
drive him from your house like a mad dog; for, be

assured, that a being so base and crue] is never to be 
reclaimed: all your efforts at persuasion are useless ; 
his promises and vows are made but to be broken ; 
your endeavours to keep the thing from the 
knowledge of the world, only prolong his plundering 
of you; and many a tender father and mother have 
been ruined by such endeavours; the whole story 
must come out at last, and it is better to come out 
before you be ruined, than after your ruin is com- 
pleted. .

these; Jet me hope, that the young men who read 
it will abstain from those vices which lead to such 
fatal results ; that they will, before they utter the 
marriage vow, duly reflect on the great duties that 
that vow imposes on them; that they will repel, 
from the outset, every temptation to any thing 
tending to give pain to the defenceless persons whose 
love for them have placed them at their mercy ; 
and that they will imprint on their own minds this 
truth, that a bad husband was never yet a happy man.

LETTER V 
TO A FATHER 
225, ‘Lrrriz children, says the Scripture, ‘are 
like arrows in the hands of the giant, and blessed is 
the man that hath his quiver full of them’; a 
beautiful figure to describe, in forcible terms, the 
support, the power, which a father derives from 
being surrounded by a family. And what father, 
thus blessed, is there who does not feel, in this sort 
of support, a reliance which he feels in no other? 
In regard to this sort of support there is no uncer- 
tainty, no doubts, no misgivings; it is yourself that 
you see in your children : their bosoms are the safe 
repository of even the whispers of you mind: they 
are the great and unspeakable delight of your youth, 
the pride of your prime of life, and the props of your 
old age. ‘They proceed from that love, the pleasures 
of which no tongue or pen can adequately describe, 
and the various Blessings which they bring are equally 
incapable of description. 
226. But, to make them blessings, you must act 
your part well; for they may, by your neglect, your 
ill-treatment, your evil example, be made to be the 
contrary of blessings ; instead of pleasure, they ma‘ 
bring you pain; instead of making your heart glad, 
the sight of them may make it sorrowful ; instead of 
being the staff of your old age, they may bring your 
gray hairs in grief to the grave. 
227. It is, therefore, of the greatest importance, 
that you here act well your part, omitting nothing,

even from the very beginning, tending to give you 
great and unceasing influence over their minds ; and, 
above all things, to ensure, if possible, an ardent love 
of their mother. Your first duty towards them is 
resolutely to prevent their drawing the means of life 
From any breast but hers. That is their own ; it is 
their birthright ; and if that fail from any natural 
cause, the place of it ought to be supplied by those 
means which are frequently resorted to without 
employing a hireling breast. 1 am aware of the too 
frequent practice of the contrary ; I am well aware 
of the offence which I shall here give to many; but 
it is for me to do my duty, and to set, with regard 
to myself, consequences at defiance. 
228, In the first place, no food is so congenial to 
the child as the milk of its own mother ; its ality 
is made by nature to suit the age of the child; it 
comes with the child, and is calculated precisely for 
its stomach, And, then, what sort of a mother must 
that be who can endure the thought of seeing her 
child at another breast! The suckling may be 
attended with great pain, and it is so attended in 
many cases ; but this pain is a necessary consequence 
of pleasures foregone ; and, besides, it has its accom- 
panying pleasuggs too. No mother ever suffered 
more than my wife did from suckling her children. 
How many times have I seen her, when the child 
was beginning to draw, bite her lips while the tears 
ran down her cheeks! Yet, having endured this, the 
smiles came and dried up the tears; and the little 
thing that had caused the pain received abundant 
kisses as its punishment. 
229. Why, now, did I not love her the more for 
this? Did not this tend to rivet her to my heart ? 
She was enduring this for me; and would not this 
endearing thought have been wanting, if I had seen
-P-A-G-E-199
Vv] TO A FATHER 197 
the baby at a breast that I had hired and paid for ; 
if I had had two women, one to bear the child and 
another to give it milk? Of all the sights that 
this world affords, the most delightful in my eyes, 
even to an unconcerned spectator, is, a mother with 
her clean and fat baby lugging at her breast, leaving 
off now-and-then and smiling, and she, occasionally, 
half smothering it with kisses. What must that 
sight be, then, to the father of the child ? 
230. Besides, are we to overlook the at and 
wonderful effect that this has on the minds of chil- 
dren? As they succeed each other, they see with 
their own eyes, the pain, the care, the caresses, which 
their mother has endured for, or bestowed, on then ; 
and nature bids them love her accordingly. To love 
her ardently becomes part of their very nature ; and 
when the time comes that her advice to them js 
necessary as a guide for their conduct, this deep and 
early impression has all its natural weight, which 
must be wholly wanting if the child be banished to 
a hireling breast, and only brought at times into the 
presence of the mother, who is, in fact, no mother, 
or, at least, but half a one. The children who are 
thus banished, love (as is natural and just) the foster. 
mother better than the real mother as long as they 
are at the breast. When this ceases, they are taught 
to love their own mother most ; but this teaching is 
of a cold and formal kind. They may, and generally 
do, in a short time, care little about the foster- 
mother; the teaching weans all their affection from 
her, but it does not transfer it to the other. 
231, had the pleasure to.know, in Hampshire, 
a lady who had brought ” a family of ten children 
by hand, as they call it. Owing to some defect, she 
could not suckle her children; but she wisely and 
heroically resolved, that her children should hang
-P-A-G-E-200
198 COBBETT’S ADVICE [Letter 
upon no other breast, and that she would not rtici- 
te in the crime of robbing another child of its 
irthright, and, as is mostly the case, of its life. Who 
has not seen these banished children, when brought 
and put into the arms of their mothers, screaming 
to get from them, and stretch out their little hands 
to get back into the arms of the nurse, and when 
safely got there, hugging the hireling as if her bosom 
were a place of refuge? Why, such a sight is, one 
would think, enough to strike a mother dead. And 
what sort of a husband and father, I want to know, 
must that be, who can endure the thought of his 
child loving another woman more than its own mother 
and his wife ? 
232, And besides all these considerations, is there 
no crime in robbing the ehild of the nurse, and in 
exposing it to perish? It will not do to say that the 
child of the nurse may be dead, and thereby leave 
her breast for the use of some other. Such cases 
must happen too seldom to be at all relied on; and, 
indeed, every one must see, that, generally speaking, 
there must be-a child cast off for every one that is 
put to a hireling breast. Now, without supposing 
it possible, that the hireling will, in any case, contrive 
to get rid of her own child, every man who employs 
such hireling, must know, that he is exposing such 
child to destruction ; that he is assisting to rob it of 
the means of life ; and, of course, assisting to procure 
its death, as completely as a man can, in any case, 
assist in causing death by starvation ; a consideration 
which will make every just man in the world recoil 
at the thought of employing a hireling breast. For 
he is not to think of pacifying his conscience by 
saying, that he knows nothing about the hireling’s 
child. He does know; for he must know, that she 
has a child, and that he is a principal in robbing it 
 
-P-A-G-E-201
Vv] TO A FATHER 199 
of the means of life. He does not cast it off and 
leave it to perish himself, but he causes the thing to 
be done; and to all intents and purposes, he is a 
principal in the cruel and cowardly crime. 
283. And if an argument could possibly be yet 
wanting to the husband ; if his feelings were so stiff 
as still to remain unmoved, must not the wife be 
aware that whatever face the world may put upon it, 
however custom may seem to bear her out ; must she 
not be aware that every one must see the main motive 
which induces her to banish from her arms that 
which has formed part of her own body? All the 
pretences about her sore breasts and her want of 
strength are vain: nature says that she is to endure 
the pains as well as the pleasures: whoever has heard 
the Mleating of the ewe for her lamb, and has seen 
her reconciled, or at least pacified, by having pre- 
sented to her the skin or some of the blood of her 
dead lamb: whoever has witnessed the difficulty of 
inducing either ewe or cow to give her milk to an 
alien young one: whoever has seen the valour of the 
timid hen in defending her brood, and has observed 
that she never swallows a morsel that is fit for her 
young, until they be amply satisfied: whoever has 
seen the wild birds, though, at other times, shunning 
even the distant approach of man, flying and scream- 
ing round his head, and exposing themselves to almost 
certain death in defence of their nests : whoever has 
seen these things, or any one of them, must question 
the motive that can induce a mother to banish a child 
from her own breast to that of one who has already 
been so unnatural as to banish hers. And, in seeking 
for a motive sufficiently powerful to lead to such an 
act, women must excuse men, if they be not satisfied 
with the ordinary pretences; they must excuse me, 
at any rate, if I do not stop even at love of ease and
-P-A-G-E-202

want of maternal affection, and if I express my fear, 
that, superadded to the unjustifiable motives, there 
is one which is calculated to excite disgust ; namely, 
a desire to be quickly freed from that restraint which 
the child imposes, and to hasten back, unbridled and 
undisfigured, to those enjoyments, to have an eager- 
ness for which, or to wish to excite a desire for which, 
a really delicate woman will shudder at the thought 
of being suspected. 
234, I am well aware of the hostility that I have 
here been exciting; but there is another, and still 
more furious, bull to take by the horns, and which 
would have been encountered some pages back (that 
being the proper place), had I not hesitated between 
my duty rade my desire to. avoid giving offence; 
I mean the employing of male-operators, on those 
occasions where females used to be employed. And 
here I have every thing against me; the now general 
custom, even amongst the most chaste and delicate 
women ; the ridicule continually cast on old mid- 
wives; the interest of a profession, for the members 
of which I entertain more respect and regard than 
for those of any other ; and, above all the rest, my 
own example to the contrary, and my knowledge that 
every husband has the same apology that I had. 
But because I acted wrong myself, it is not less, but 
rather more, my duty to endeavour to dissuade others 
from doing the same. My wife had suffered very 
severely with her second child, which, at last, was 
still-born. The next time I pleaded for the doctor ; 
and, after every argument that I could think of, 
obtained a reluctant consent. Her life was so dear 
to me, that every thing else ap d as nothing. 
Every husband has the same apology to make; and 
thus, from the good, and not from the bad, feelings of men, the practice has become far too general, for
-P-A-G-E-203
Vv] TO A FATHER 201 
me to hope even to narrow it; but, nevertheless, 
I cannot refrain from giving my opinion on the 
subject, 
235. We are apt to talk in a very unceremonious 
style of our rude ancestors, of their gross habits, their 
want of delicacy in their language. No man shall ever 
make me believe, that those, who reared the cathe- 
dral of Exy (which I saw the other day), were rude, 
either in their manners or in their minds and words. 
No man shall make me believe, that our ancestors 
were a rude and beggarly race, when I read in an act 
of parliament, passed in the reign of Edward the 
Fourth, regulating the dresses of the different ranks 
of the people, and forbidding the LABOURERS to 
wear coats of cloth that cost more than two shillings 
a yard (equal to forty shillings of our present money), 
and forbidding their wives and daughters to wear 
sashes, or girdles, trimmed with gold or silver. No 
man shall make me believe that this was a rude and 
beggarly race, compared with those who now shirk and 
shiver about in canvass frocks and rotten cottons, 
Nor shall any man persuade me that that was a 
rude and beggarly state of things, in which (reign 
of Edward the Third) an act was passed regulating 
the wages of labour, and ordering that a woman, for 
weeding in the corn, should receive a penny a day, 
while a guart of red wine was sold for a penny, and 
a pair of men’s shoes for two-pence. No man shall 
make me believe that agriculture was in a rude state, 
when an act like this was passed, or that our ancestors 
of that day were rude in their minds, or in their 
thoughts. Indeed, there are a thousand proofs, that, 
whether in regard to domestic or foreign affairs, 
whether in regard to internal freedom and happiness, 
or to weight in the world, England was at her zenith 
about the reign of Edward the Third. The Refor-

mation, as it is called, gave her a complete pull down. 
She revived again in the reigns of the Stuarts, as 
far as related to internal affairs ; but the ‘ Glorious 
Revolution’ and its debt and its taxes, have, amidst 
the false glare of new palaces, roads, and canals, 
brought her down until she is become the land of 
domestic misery and of foreign impotence and _con- 
tempt; and, until she, amidst all her boasted im- 
provements and refinements, tremblingly awaits her 
lL. 
236. However, to return from this digression, rude 
and unrefined as our mothers might be, plain and 
unvarnished as they might be in their language, 
accustomed as they might be to call things by their 
names, though they were not so very delicate as to 
use the wo! snail clothes; and to be quite unable, 
in speaking of horn-cattle, horses, sheep, the canine 
race, and poultry, to designate them by their sexual 
appellations ; though they might not absolutely faint 
at hearing these appellations used by others ; rude and 
unrefined and indelicate as they might be, they did 
not suffer, in the cases alluded to, the approaches of 
men, which approaches are unceremoniously suffered, 
and even sought, by their polished and refined and 
delicate daughters; and of unmarried men too, in 
many cases; and of very young men. 
237. From all antiquity this office was allotted to 
woman, Mosxs’s life was saved by the humanity of 
the Egyptian midwife; and to the employment of 
females in this memorable case, the world is probably 
indebted for that which has been left it by that greatest 
of all law-givers, whose institutes, rude as they were, 
have been the foundation of all the wisest and most 
just laws in all the countries of Europe and America. it was the fellow feeling of the midwife for the poor 
mother that saved Moses, And none but a mother
-P-A-G-E-205
y] TO A FATHER 203 
can, in such cases, feel to the full and effectual extent 
that which the operator ought to feel. She has keen 
in the same state herself; she knows more about the 
matter, except in cases of very rare occurrence, than 
any man, however great his learning and experience, 
can ever know. She knows all the previous symp- 
toms; she can judge more correctly than man can 
judge in such a case; she can put questions to the 
party, which a man.cannot put; the communica- 
tion between the two is wholly without reserve ; the 
person of the one is given up to the other, as com- 
pletely as her own is under her command. This 
never can be the case with a man-operator ; for, after 
all that can be said or done, the native feeling of 
women, in whatever rank of life, will, in these cases, 
restrain them from saying and doing, before a man, 
even before a husband, many things which they ought 
tosayand do. So that, perhaps, even with regard to 
the bare question of comparative safety to life, the 
midwife is the preferable person. 
238. But sakety to life is not ALL. The preser- 
vation of life is not to be preferred to EVERY 
THING. Ought not a man to prefer death to the 
commission of treason against his country? Ought 
not a man to die, rather than save his life by the 
prostitution of his wife to a tyrant, who insists upon 
the one or the other? Every man and every woman 
will answer in the affirmative to both these questions. 
There are, then, cases where people ought to submit 
to certain death. Surely, then, the mere chance, the 
mere possibility of it, ought not to outweigh the 
mighty considerations on the other side; ought not 
to overcome that inborn modesty, that sacred reserve 
as to their persons, which, as I said before, is the 
charm of charms of the female sex, and which our 
mothers, rude as they are called by us, took, we may

be satisfied, the best and most effectual means of 
preserving. — . oo. 
239. But is there, after all, any thing real in this 
greater security for the life of either mother or child ? 
Tf, then, risk were so great as to call upon women to 
overcome this natural repugnance to suffer the ap- 
proaches of a man, that risk must be general; it 
must apply to all women; and, further, it must, 
ever since the creation of man, always have so applied. 
Now, resorting to the employment of men-operators 
has not been in vogue in Europe more than about 
seventy years, and has not been general in England 
more than about thirty or forty years. So that the 
risk in employing midwives must, of late years, have 
become vastly greater than it was even when I was ~ 
a. boy, or the whole race must have been extinguished 
long ago. And, then, how puzzled we should be to 
account for the building of all the cathedrals, and all 
the churches, and the draining of all the marshes, 
and all the fens, more than a thousand years before 
the word ‘accoucheur’ ever came from the lips of 
woman, and before the thought came into her mind ? 
And here, even in the use of this word, we have 
a. specimen of the refined delicacy of the present age; 
here we have, varnish the matter over how we may, 
modesty in the word and grossness in the thought. 
Farmers’ wives, daughters, and maids, cannot now 
allude to, or hear named, without blushing, those 
affairs of the homestead, which they, within my 
memory, used to talk about as freely as of milking 
or spinning; but, have they become more really 
modest than their mothers were? Has this refinement 
made them more continent than those rude mothers ? 
A jury at Westminster gave, about six years ago, 
damages to a man, calling himself a gentleman, 
against a farmer, because the latter, for the purpose
-P-A-G-E-207
VJ TO A FATHER 205 
for which such animals are kept, had a bull in his 
yard, on which the windows of the gentleman looked! 
e plaintiff alleged, that this was so offensive to 
his wife and daughters, that, if the defendant were 
not compelled to desist, he should be obliged to 
brick up his windows, or to quit the house! If T had 
been the father of these, at once, delicate and curious 
daughters, I would not have been the herald of their 
purity of mind; and if I had been the suitor of one 
of them, I would have taken care to give up the suit 
with all convenient speed ; for how could I reasonably 
have hoped ever to be able to prevail on delicacy, so 
exquisite, to commit itself to a pair of bridal sheets ? 
In spite, however, of all this ‘ refinement in the human 
mind, which is everlastingly dinned in our ears ; in 
spite of the ‘small-clothes,’ and of all the other affected 
stuff, we have this conclusion, this indubitable proof, 
of the falling off in real delicacy ; namely, that com- 
mon prostitutes, formerly unknown, now swarm in our 
towns, and are seldom wanting even in our villages ; 
and where there was one illegitimate child (including 
those coming before the time) only fifty years ago, 
there are now twenty. 
240, And who can say how far the employment 
of men, in the cases alluded to, may have assisted in 
Producing this change, so disgraceful to the present 
ge, and so injurious to the female sex? The prosti- 
tution and the swarms of illegitimate children have 
@ natural and inevitable tendency to lessen that 
Yespect, and that kind and indulgent feeling, which 
18 due from all men to virtuous women. It is well 
hown that the unworthy members of any profession, 
Calling, or rank in life, cause, by their acts, the whole 
pedy to sink in the general esteem ; it is well known,

from home, the frequent proofs of abject submission 
to tyrants ; it is well known, that these may give the 
character of dishonesty, profligacy, or cowardice, to 
a whole nation. There are, doubtless, many men in. 
Switzerland, who abhor the infamous practices of men 
selling themselves, by whole regiments, to fight for 
any foreign state that will pay them, no matter in 
what cause, and no matter whether against their own 
parents or brethren; but the censure falls upon the 
whole nation: and ‘no money, no Swiss,’ is a proverb 
throughout the world. It is, amidst those scenes of 
prostitution and bastardy, impossible for men in 
general to respect the female sex to the degree that 
they formerly did; while numbers will be apt to 
adopt the unjust sentiment of the old bachelor, Porx, 
that ‘every woman is, at heart, a rake. 
241. Who knows, I say, in what degree the em- 
ployment of men-operators may. have tended to 
produce this change, so injurious to the female sex? 
Aye, and to encourage unfeeling and brutal men to 
propose that the dead bodies of females, if poor, 
should be sold for the purpose of exhibition and dis- 
section before an audience of men; a proposition 
that our ‘rude ancestors’ would have answered, not 
by words, but by blows! Alas! our women may 
talk of ‘small-clothes’ as long as they please ; they 
may blush to scarlet at hearing animals designated by 
their sexual appellations ; it may, to give the world 
a proof of our excessive modesty and delicacy, even 
pass. a law (indeed we have done it) to punish ‘an 
exposure of the person’; but as long as our streets 
swarm with prostitutes, our asylums and private 
houses with bastards; as long as we have man- 
operators in the delicate cases alluded to, and as 
long as the exhibiting of the dead body of a virtuous 
female before an audience of men shall not be punished
-P-A-G-E-209
Vv] TO A FATHER 207 
by the law, and even with death ; as long as we shall 
appear to be satisfied in this state of things, it be- 
comes us, at any rate, to be silent about purity of 
mind, improvement of manners, and an increase of 
refinement and delicacy. 
242. This practice has brought the ‘doctor’ into 
every family in the kingdom, which is of itself no 
small evil. I am not thinking of the expense ; for, 
in cases like these, nothing in that way ought to be 
spared. If necessary to the safety of his wife, a man 
ought not only to part with his last shilling, but to 
pledge his future labour, But we all know that 
there are imaginary ailments, many of which are 
absolutely created by the habit of talking with or 
about the ‘doctor. ‘Read the ‘Domzstic Mepicinz,’ 
and by the time that you have done, you will imagine 
that you have, at times, all the diseases of which it 
treats. This practice has added to, has doubled, aye, 
has augmented, I verily believe, tenfold the number 
of the gentlemen who are, in common parlance, called 
‘doctors’ ; at which, indeed, I, on my own private 
account, ought to rejoice; for, invariably I have, 
even in the worst of times, found them every where 
amongst my staunchest and kindest friends. But 
though these gentlemen are not to blame for this, 
any more than attorneys are for their increase in 
number; and amongst these gentlemen, too, I have, 
with very few exceptions, always found sensible men 
and zealous friends; though the parties pursuing 
these professions are not to blame; though the in- 
crease of attorneys has arisen from the endless number 
and the complexity of the laws, and from the tenfold 
mass of crimes caused by poverty arising from op- 
pressive taxation ; and though the increase of ‘doctors’ 
2s arisen from the diséases and the imaginary ail- 
ments arising from that effeminate luxury which has
-P-A-G-E-210
208 COBBETT’S ADVICE [Letter 
been created by the drawing of wealth from the many, 
and giving it’ to the few; and, as the lower classes 
will always endeavour to imitate the higher, so the 
“accoucheur’ has, along with the ‘small-clothes, de- 
scended from the loan-monger’s palace down to the 
hovel of the pauper, there to take his fee out of 
the poor-rates ; though these parties are not to blame, 
the thing is not less an evil. Both professions have 
lost in character, in proportion to the increase in the 
number of its members; peaches, if they grew on 
hedges, would rank but little above the berries of the 
bramble. 
243. But to return once more to the matter of risk 
of life; can it be that nature has so ordered it, that, 
as a general thing, the life of either mother or child 
shall be in danger, even if there were no attendant 
at all? Can this be? Certainly it cannot: safety 
must be the rule, and da the exception; this 
must be the case, or the world never could have been 
peopled ; and, perhaps, in ninety-nine cases out of 
every hundred, if nature were left wholly to herself, 
all would be right. The great doctor in these cases, 
js, comforting, consoling, cheering up. And who can 
erform this office like women ? who have for these 
occasions & janguage and sentiments which seem to 
ve been invented for the purpose; and be they 
what they may as to general demeanour and character, 
they have all, upon these occasions, one common feel- 
ings and that so amiable, so excellent, as to admit of 
no adequate description, They completely forget, 
for the me all rivalships, all squabbles, all animosi- 
Hes all aired even ; every one feels as if it were her 
ow? particular concern. 
. These, te may be well assured, are the proper 
attendee the ese occasions ; the mother, the aunt, 
ibe sister, cousin, and female neighbour ; these
-P-A-G-E-211
Vj TO A FATHER 209 
are the suitable attendants, having some experienced 
woman to afford extraordinary aid, if such be neces- 
sary; and in the few cases where the preservation of 
life demands the surgeon’s skill, he is always at hand. 
The contrary practice, which we got from the French, 
is not, however, so general in France as in England. 
We have outstripped all the world in this, as we 
have in every thing which proceeds from luxury and 
effeminacy on the one hand, and from poverty on the 
other; the millions have been stripped of their means 
to heap wealth on the thousands, and have been 
corrupted in manners, as well as in morals, by vicious 
examples set them by the possessors of that wealth. 
As reason says that the practice of which I complain 
cannot be cured without a total change in society, it 
would be presumption in me to expect such cure 
from any efforts oF mine. I therefore must content 
myself with hoping that such change will come, and 
with declaring, that if I had to live my life over 
again, I would act upon the opinions which I have 
thought it my bounden duty here to state and 
endeavour to maintain. 
245. Having gotten over these thorny places as 
quickly as possible, I gladly come back to the 
Bases; with regard to whom I shall have no 
prejudices, no affectation, no false pride, no sham 
fears to encounter; every heart (except there be one 
made of flint) being with me here. ‘Then were 
there brought unto him little children, that he should 
put his hands on them, and pray: and the disciples 
rebuked them. But Jesus said, Suffer little children, 
and forbid them not to come unto me; for of such 
is the kingdom of heaven.’ A figure most forcibly 
expressive of the character and beauty of innocence, 
and, at the same time, most aptly illustrative of the 
doctrine of regeneration. And where is the man; 
COBBETT. AD, P

the woman who is not fond of babies is not worthy 
the name; but where is the man who does not feel 
his heart softened ; who does not feel himself become 
gentler; who does not lose all the hardness of his 
temper; when, in any way, for any purpose, or by 
any body, an appeal is made to him in behalf of 
these so helpless and so perfectly innocent little 
creatures ? 
246. SHaxsPEaRE, who is cried up as the great 
interpreter of the human heart, has said, that the 
man in whose soul there is no music, or love of music, 
is ‘fit for murders, treasons, stratagems, and spoils.’ 
‘Our immortal bard, as the profligate Suerman 
used to call him in public, while he laughed at him 
in private; our ‘immortal bard’ seems to have for- 
gotten that Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, were 
flung into the fiery furnace (made seven times hotter 
than usual) amidst the sound of the cornet, flute, 
harp, sackbut, and dulcimer, and all kinds of music; . 
he seems to have forgotten that it was a music and 
a dance-loving damsel that chose, as a recompense 
for her elegant performance, the bloody head of 
John the Baptist, brought to her in a charger; he 
seems to have forgotten that, while Rome burned, 
Nero fiddled: he did not know, perhaps, that can- 
nibals always dance and sing while their victims are 
roasting ; but he might have known, and he must 
have known, that England’s greatest tyrant, Hen 
VII, had, as his agent in blood, Thomas Cromwell, 
expressed it, ‘his sweet soul enwrapped in the celestial 
sounds of music;’ and this was just at the time - - 
when the ferocious tyrant was ordering Catholics 
and Protestants to be tied back to back on the same 
hurdle, dragged to Smithfield on that hurdle, and 
there tied to, and burnt from, the same stake. 
Shakspeare must have known these things, for he
-P-A-G-E-213
Vv] TO A FATHER ail 
lived immediately after their date; and if he had 
lived in our day, he would have seen instances enough 
of ‘sweet souls’ enwrapped in the same manner, 
and capable, if not of deeds equally bloody, of 
others, discovering a total want of, feeling for sufferings not unfrequently occasioned by their own 
wanton waste, and waste ‘arising, too, in part, from 
their taste for these ‘celestial sounds.’ 
247. O no! the heart of man is not to be known 
by this test: a great fondness for music is a mark of 
great weakness, great vacuity of mind: not of hard- 
ness of heart; not of vice; not of downright folly ; 
but of a want of capacity, or inclination, for sober 
thought. This is not always the case: accidental 
circumstances almost force the taste upon people: 
but, generally speaking, it is a preference of sound to 
sense, But the man, and especially the father, who 
is not fond of babies ; who Hoes not feel his heart 
softened when he touches their almost boneless 
limbs; when he sees their little eyes first begin to 
discern; when he hears their tender accents; the 
man whose heart does not beat truly to this test, is, 
to say the best of him, an object of compassion. 
248, But the mother’s feelings are here to be 
thought of too; for, of all gratifications, the very 
greatest that a mother can receive, is notice taken 
of, and praise bestowed on, her baby. The moment 
that pets into her arms, every thing else diminishes 
in value, the father only excepted. Her own personal 
charms, notwithstanding all that men say and have 
written on the subject, become, at most, a secondary 
object as soon as the baby arrives. A saying of the 
old, profligate King of Prussia is frequently quoted 
in proof of the truth of the maxim, that a woman 
will forgive any thing but calling her ugly; a very 
true maxim, perhaps, as applied to prostitutes, 
PQ

212 COBBET?E’S ADVICE [Letter 
whether in high or low life; but a pretty long life 
of observation has told me, that a mother, worthy 
of the name, will care little about what you say of 
her person, so that you will but extol the beauty 
of her baby. Her baby is always the very prettiest 
that ever was born! It is always an eighth wonder 
of the world! And thus it ought to be, or there 
would be a want of that wondrous attachment to 
it which is necessary to bear her up through all those 
cares and pains and toils inseparable from the 
preservation of its life and health. 
249, It is, however, of the part which the husband 
has to act, in participating in these cares and toils, 
that I am now to speak. Let no man imagine that 
the world will despise him for helping to take care 
of his own child: thoughtless fools may attempt to 
ridicule ; the unfeeling few may join in the attempt ; 
but all, whose good opinion is worth having, will 
applaud his conduct, and will, in many cases, be 
disposed to repose confidence in him on that very 
account. To say of a man, that he is fond of his 
family, is, of itself, to say that, in private life at 
least, he is a good and trust-worthy man; aye, an 
in public life too, pretty much; for it is no easy 
matter to separate the two characters; and it is 
naturally concluded, that he who has been flagrantly 
wanting in feeling for his own flesh and blood, will 
not be very sensitive towards the rest of mankind. 
There is nothing more amiable, nothing more delight- 
ful to behold, than a young man especially taking 
part in the work of nursing the children; and how 
often have I admired this in the labouring men in 
Hampshire! It is, indeed, generally the same all over 
England; and as to America, it would be deemed 
brutal for a man not to take his full share of these 
cares and labours,
-P-A-G-E-215
vj TO A FATHER 213 
250. The man who is to gain a living by his 
labour, must be drawn away from home, or, at 
least, from the cradle-side, in order to perform that 
Jabour; but this will not, if he be made of good 
stuff, prevent him from doing his share of the duty 
due to his children. There are still many hours in 
the twenty-four, that he will have to spare for this 
duty ; and there ought to be no toils, no watchings, 
no breaking of rest, imposed by this duty, of which 
he ought not to perform his full share, and that, 
too, without grudging. This is strictly due from 
him in payment for the pleasures of the marriage 
state. What right has he to the sole possession of 
a woman’s person; what right to a husband's vast 
authority ; what right to the honourable title and 
the boundless power of father: what right has he to 
all, or any of these, unless he can found his claim on 
the faithful performance of all the duties which these 
titles imply ? 
251. One great source of the unhappiness amongst 
mankind arises, however, from a neglect of these 
duties; but, as if by way of compensation for their 
privations, they are much more duly performed by 
the poor than by the rich. The fashion of the 
labouring people is this: the husband, when free 
from his toil in the fields, takes his share in the 
nursing, which he manifestly looks upon as a sort 
of reward for his labour. However distant from his 
cottage, his heart is always at that home towards 
which he is carried, at night, by limbs that feel not 
their weariness, being urged on by a heart anticipat- 
ing the welcome of those who attend him there. 
Those who have, as I so many hundreds of times 
have, seen the labourers in the woodland parts of 
Hampshire and Sussex, coming, at night-fall, towards 
their cottage-wickets, laden with fuel for a day or

two; whoever has seen three or four little creatures 
looking out for the father’s approach, running in to 
announce the glad tidings, and then scampering out 
to meet him, clinging round his knees, or hanging 
on his skirts; whoever has witnessed scenes like this, 
to witness which has formed one of the greatest 
delights of my life, will hesitate long before he 
prefer a life of ease to a life of labour; before he 
prefer a communication with children intercepted b 
servants and teachers to that communication whic! 
is here direct, and which admits not of any division 
of affection. 
252. Then comes the Sunday; and, amongst all 
those who keep no servants, a. great deal depends on 
the manner in which the father employs that day. 
When there are two or three children, or even one 
child, the first thing, after the breakfast (which is 
late on this day of rest), is to wash and dress the 
child or children. Then, while the mother is 
dressing the dinner, the father, being in his Sunday- 
clothes himself, takes care of the child or children. 
When dinner is over, the mother puts on her best ; 
and then, all go to church, or, if that cannot be, 
whether from distance or other cause, all pass the 
afternoon together. This used to be the way of life 
amongst the labouring people; and from this wa: 
of life arose the most able and most moral people 
that the world ever saw, until grinding taxation 
took from them the means of obtaining a sufficiency 
of food and of raiment; plunged the whole, good 
and bad, into one indiscriminate mass, under the 
degrading and hateful name of paupers. 253. The working man, in whatever line, and whether in town or country, who spends his da: of 
rest, or any part of it, except in case of absolute 
necessity, away from his wife and children, is not
-P-A-G-E-217
VJ TO A FATHER a5 
worthy of the name of father, and is seldom worthy 
of the trust of any employer. Such absence argues 
a want of fatherly and of conjugal affection, which 
want is generally duly repaid by a similar want in 
the neglected parties; and, though stern authority 
may command and enforce obedience for a while, the 
time soon comes when it will be set at defiance; 
and when such a father, having no example, no 
proofs of love, to plead, complains of filial imgrati- 
tude, the silent indifference of his neighbours, and 
which is more poignant, his own heart, will tell him 
that his complaint is unjust. 
254, Thus far with regard to working people; 
but much more necessary is it to inculcate these 
principles in the minds of young men in the middle 
rank of life, and to be more particular, in their case, 
with regard to the care due to very young children, 
for here servants come in; and many are but too 
prone to think, that when they have handed their 
children over to well-paid and able servants, they 
have done their duty by them, than which there can 
hardly be a more mischievous error. The children 
of the poorer people are, in general, much fonder 
of their parents than those of the rich are of theirs : 
this fondness is reciprocal ; and the cause is, that the 
children of the former have, from their very birth, 
had a greater share than those of the latter—of the 
personal attention, and of the never-ceasing endear- 
ments of their parents. 
255. I have before urged upon young married 
men, in the middle walks of life, to keep the servants 
out of the house as long as possible ; and when they 
must come at last, when they must be had even to 
assist in taking care of children, let them be assistants 
in the most strict sense of the word ; let them not be 
confided in ; let children never be left to them alone ;

and the younger the child, the more necessary a rigid 
adherence to this rule. I shall be told, perhaps, ry 
some careless father, or some play-haunting mother, 
that female servants are women, and have the tender 
feelings of women. Very true; and, in general, as 
good and kind in their nature as the mother herself. 
But they are not the mothers of your children, and it 
is not in nature that they should have the care and 
anxiety adequate to the necessity of the case. Out 
of the immediate care and personal superintendence 
of one or the other of the parents, or of some trust: 
relation, no young child ought to be suffered to be, if 
there be, at whatever sacrifice of ease or of property, 
any possibility of preventing it: because, to insure, 
if possible, the perfect form, the straight limbs, the 
sound body, and the sane mind of your children, is 
the very first of all your duties. To provide fortunes 
for them; to make provision for their future fame; 
to give them the learning necessary to the calling for 
which you destine them: all these may be duties, 
and the last is a duty ; but a duty far greater than, and 
prior to, all these, is the duty of neglecting nothing 
within your power to insure them a sane mind in 
a sound and undeformed body. And, good God! 
how many are the instances of deformed bodies, of 
crooked limbs, of idiocy, or of deplorable imbecility, 
proceeding solely from young children being left to 
the care of servants! One would imagine, that one 
single sight of this kind to be seen, or heard of, in 
a whole nation, would be sufficient to deter parents 
from the practice. And what, then, must those 
parents feel, who have brought this life-long sorrow- 
ing on themselves! When once the thing is done, 
to repent is unavailing. And what is now the worth 
of all the ease and all the pleasures, to enjoy which 
the poor sufferer was abandoned to the care of 
servants !
-P-A-G-E-219

256. What! can I plead example, then, in support 
of this rigid precept? Did we, who have bred up 
a family of children, and have had servants during 
the greater part of the time, ever leave a young 
child to the care of servants? Never; no, not for one 
single hour. Were we, then, tied constantly to the 
house with them? No; for we sometimes took them 
out; but one or the other of us was always with 
them, until, in succession, they were able to take 
good care of themselves; or until the elder ones 
were able to take care of the younger, and then they 
sometimes stood sentinel in our stead. How could 
we visit then? Why, if both went, we bargained 
beforehand to take the children with us; and if this 
were a thing not to be proposed, one of us went, 
and the other stayed at home, the latter being ve: 
frequently my lot. From this we never once deviated. 
We cast aside all consideration of convenience; all 
calculations of expense; all thoughts of pleasure of 
every sort. And, what could have equalled the 
reward that we have received for our care and for 
our unshaken resolution in this respect ? 
257. In the rearing of children, there is resolution 
wanting as well as tenderness. That parent is not 
truly affectionate who wants the courage to do that 
which is sure to give the child temporary pain. 
A great deal, in providing for the health and strength 
of children, depends upon their being duly and daily 
washed, when well, in cold water from head to foot. 
Their cries testify to what a degree they dislike 
this, They squall and kick and twist about at a 
fine rate; and many mothers, too many, neglect this, 
partly from reluctance to encounter the squalling, and 
partly, and much too often, from what I will not call 
idleness, but to which I cannot apply a milder term 
than neglect. Well and duly performed, it is an hour’s
-P-A-G-E-220

good tight work; for, besides the bodily labour, 
which is not very slight when the child gets to 
be five or six months old, there is the singing to 
overpower the voice of the child. The moment the 
stripping of the child used to begin, the singing 
to begin, and the latter never ceased till the 
former had ceased. After having heard this go on 
with all my children, Rousseau taught me the philo- 
sophy of it, I happened, by accident, to look into 
his Emrz, and there I found him saying, that the 
nurse subdued the voice of the child and made it 
quiet, by drowning its voice in hers, and thereby 
making it perceive that it could not be heard, an 
that to continue to cry was of no avail. ‘Here, 
Nancy,’ said I (going to her with the book in my 
hand), ‘you have been a great Philosopher all your 
life, without either of us knowing it.’ silent nurse 
is a poor soul. It is a great disadvantage to the 
child, if the mother be of a very silent, placid, quiet 
turn. The singing, the talking to, the tossing and 
rolling about, that mothers in general practise, are 
very Seneficial to the children: they give them 
exercise, awaken their attention, animate them, and 
rouse them to action. It is very bad to have a child 
even carried about by a dull, inanimate, silent servant, 
who will never talk, sing or chirrup to it; who will 
but just carry it about, always kept in the same 
attitude, and seeing and hearing nothing to give 
it life and spirit. It requires nothing but a dull 
creature like this, and the washing and dressing left 
to her, to give a child the Hiekets, and make it, 
instead of being a strong straight person, tup-shinned, 
bow-kneed, or hump-backed ; besides other ailments 
not visible to the eye, By-and-by, when the de- 
formity begins to appear, the doctor is called in, but it is too late: the mischief is done ; and a few months

of neglect are punished by a life of mortification and 
sorrow, not wholly unaccompanied with shame. 
258. It is, therefore, a very spurious kind of ten- 
derness that prevents a mother from doing the things 
which, though disagreeable to the child, are so neces- 
sary to its lasting well-being. The washing daily in 
the morning is a great thing; cold water winter or 
summer, and this never left to a servant, who has not, 
in such a case, either the patience or the courage that 
is necessary for the task. When the washing is over, 
and the child dressed in its day-clothes, how gay and 
cheerful it looks! The exercise gives it appetite, 
and then disposes it to rest; and it sucks ant sleeps 
and grows, the delight of all eyes, and particularly 
those of the parents. ‘I can’t bear that squalling !° 
I have heard men say; and to which I answer, that 
‘I can’t bear such men!’ There are, I thank God, 
very few of them ; for, if they do not always reason 
about the matter, honest nature teaches them to be 
considerate and indulgent towards little creatures so 
innocent and so helpless and so unconscious of what 
they do. And the noise: after all, why should it 
disturb a man? He knows the exact cause of it: he 
knows that it is the unavoidable consequence of a 
great good to his child, and of course to him: it 
lasts but an hour, and the recompense instantly comes 
in the looks of the rosy child, and in the new hopes 
which every look excites. It never disturbed me, 
and my occupation was one of those most liable to 
disturbance by noise. Many a score papers have I 
written amidst the noise of children, and in my whole 
life never bade them be still, When they grew up 
to be big enough to gallop about the house, I have, 
in wet weather, when they could not go out, written 
the whole day amidst noise that would have made 
some authors half mad. It never annoyed me at all.

220 COBBETT’S ADVICE [Letter 
But a Scotch piper, whom an old lady, who lived 
beside us at Brompton, used to y to come and play 
a@ long tune every day, I was obliged to bribe into 
a breach of contract. That which you are pleased 
with, however noisy, does not disturb you. That 
which is indifferent to you has not more effect. The 
rattle of coaches, the clapper of a mill, the fall of 
water, leave your mind undisturbed. But the sound 
of the pipe, awakening the idea of the lazy life of the 
piper, better paid than the labouring man, drew the 
mind aside from its pursuit; and, as it really was 
a nuisance, occasioned by the money of m: neighbour, 
I thought myself justified in abating it by the same 
sort of means. 
259, The cradle is in poor families necessary ; 
because necessity compels the mother to get as much 
time as she can for her work, and a child can rock 
the cradle. At first we had a cradle; and I rocked 
the cradle, in great part, during the time that I was 
writing my first work, that famous Matrnre p’ANGLOIs, 
which has long been the first book in Europe, as 
well as in America, for teaching of French People 
the English language. But we left off the use of the 
cradle as soon as possible. It causes sleep more, and 
oftener, than necessary: it saves trouble; but to 
take trouble was our duty. After the second child, 
we had no cradle, however difficult at first to do 
without it. When I was not at my business, it was 
generally my affair to put the child to sleep: some- 
times by sitting with it in my arms, and sometimes 
by lying down on a bed with it, till it fell asleep. 
e soon found the good of this method. The 
children did not sleep so much, but they slept more 
soundly. The cradle produces a sort of dosing, or 
dreaming sleep. This is a matter of great impor- 
tance, as every thing must be that has any influence
-P-A-G-E-223
Vv] TO A FATHER 221 
on the health of children. The poor must use the 
cradle, at least until they have other children big 
enough to hold the baby, and to put it to sleep; 
and it is truly wonderful at how early an age they, 
either girls or boys, will do this business faithfully 
and well. You see them in the lanes, and on the 
skirts of woods and commons, lugging a baby about, 
when it sometimes weighs half as much as the nurse. 
The poor mother is frequently compelled, in order to 
help to get bread for her children, to go to a distance 
from home, and leave the group, baby and all, to 
take care of the house and of themselves, the eldest 
of four or five, not, perhaps, above six or seven years 
old; and it is quite surprising, that, considering the 
millions of instances in which this is done in England, 
in the course of a year, so very, very few accidents 
or injuries arise from the practice; and not a hun- 
dredth part so many as arise in the comparatively 
few instances in which children are left to the care of 
servants. In summer time you see these little groups 
rolling about up the green, or amongst the heath, 
not far from the cottage, and at a mile, perhaps, 
from any other dwelling, the dog their only pro- 
tector. And what fine and straight and healthy and 
fearless and acute persons they become! It used to 
be remarked in Philadelphia, when I lived there, that 
there was not a single man of any eminence, whether 
doctor, lawyer, merchant, trader, or any thing else, 
that had not been born and bred in the country, and 
of parents in a low state of life. Examine London, 
and you will find it much about the same. From 
this very childhood they are from necessity entrusted 
with the care of something valuable, They practically 
learn to think, and to calculate as to consequences. 
They are thus taught to remember things ; and it is 
quite surprising what memories they have, and how

scrupulously a little carter-boy will deliver half-a- 
dozen messages, each of a different purport from the 
rest, to as many persons, all the messages committed 
to him at one and the same time, and he not knowing 
one letter of the alphabet from another. When I 
want to remember something, and am out in the field, 
and cannot write it down, I say to one of the men, 
or boys, come to me at such a, time, and tell me so 
and so. He is sure to do it; and I therefore look 
upon the memorandum as written down. One of 
these children, boy or girl, is much more worthy of 
being entrusted with the care of a baby, any body’s 
baby, than a servant-maid with curled locks and with 
eyes rolling about for admirers. The locks and the 
rolling eyes, very nice, and, for aught I know, very 
proper things in themselves; but incompatible wi 
the care of your baby,Ma’am; her mind being absorbed 
in contemplating the interesting circumstances which 
are to precede her having a sweet baby of her own; 
and a sweeter than yours, if you please, Ma’am ; or, 
at least, such will be her anticipations. And this is 
all right enough ; it is natural that she should think 
and feel thus; and knowing this, you are admonished 
that it is your bounden duty not to delegate this 
sacred trust to any body. 
260. The courage, of which I have spoken, so 
in the case of washing the children in spite 
of their screaming remonstrances, is, if possible, more 
necessary in cases of illness, requiring the application 
of medicine, or of surgical means of cure. Here the heart is put to the test indeed! Here is anguish to be endured by mother, who jhas to force down the 
nauseous physic, or to a e tormenting plaster ! Yet it is the mother, or the father, and mone properly 
the former, who is to perform this duty of exquisite 
pain, To no nurse, to no hireling, to no alien hand,
-P-A-G-E-225
Vv] TO A FATHER 223 
ought, if possible to avoid it, this task to be com- 
mitted. Ido not admire those mothers who are too 
tender-hearted to inflict this pain on their children, 
and who, therefore, leave it to be inflicted by others. 
Give me the mother who, while the tears stream 
down her face, has the resolution scrupulously to 
execute, with her own hands, the doctor’s commands, 
Will a servant, will any hireling, do this? Com- 
mitted to such hands, the least trouble will be pre- 
ferred to the greater : the thing will, in general, not 
be half done ; and if done, the suffering from such 
hands is far greater in the mind of the child than if 
it came from the hands of the mother. In this case, 
above all others, there ought to be no delegation of 
the parental office. Here life or limb is at stake ; 
and the parent, man or woman, who, in any one 
point, can neglect his or her duty here, is unworthy 
of the name of parent. And here, as in all the other 
instances, where goodness in the parents towards the 
children gives such weight to their advice when the 
children grow up, what a motive to filial gratitude! 
The children who are old enough to deserve and 
remember, will witness this proof of love and self- 
devotion in their mother. Each of them feels that 
she has done the same towards them all; and they 
love her and admire and revere her accordingly. 
261. This is the place to state my opinions, and 
the result of my experience, with regard to that 
fearful disease the Sma1i-Pox; a subject, too, to 
which I have paid great attention. I was always, 
from the very first mention of the thing, opposed to 
the Cow-Pox scheme. If efficacious in preventing 
the Small-Pox, I objected to it merely on the score 
of its beastliness. ere are some things, surely, 
more hideous than death, and more resolutely to 
avoided ; at any rate, more to be avoided than the
-P-A-G-E-226
224 COBBETT’S ADVICE [Letter 
mere risk of suffering death. And, amongst other 
things, I always reckoned that of a parent causing 
the Bi and the diseased blood too, of a beast to 
be put into the veins of human beings, and those 
beings the children of that parent. I, therefore, as 
will be seen in the pages of the Register of that day, 
most strenuously opposed the giving of twenty thousand 
nds to JENNER out of the taxes, paid in great part 
y the working people, which I deemed and asserted 
to be a scandalous waste of the public money. 
262. I contended, that this beastly application 
could not, in nature, be efficacious in preventing the 
Small-Pox ; and that, even if efficacious for that 
purpose, i was wholly wnnecessary. The truth of 
the former of these assertions has now been proved 
in thousands upon thousands of instances. For a lon; 
time, for ten years, the contrary was boldly an 
brazenly asserted. ‘This nation is fond of quackery 
of all ‘sorts; and this particular quackery having 
been sanctioned by King, Lords and Commons, 
it spread over the country like a pestilence borne 
by the winds. Speedily sprang up the ‘ROYAL 
fennerian Institution? and Branch Institutions, 
issuing from the parent trunk, set instantly to work, 
impregnating the veins of the rising and enlightened 
generation with the beastly matter. ‘Gentlemen 
and Ladies’ made the commodity a _pocket-com- 
panion 5 and if a cottager’s child (in Hampshire at 
least), even seen by them, on a common, were not 
pretty quick in taking to its heels, it had to carry 
off more or less of the disease of the cow. One 
paul have thought, that one-half of the cows in

had yielded, the real small-pox, in its worst form, 
broke out in the town of Rinewooo, in Hampsutire, 
and carried off, I believe (I have not the account at 
hand), more than a hundred persons, young and old, 
every one of whom had had the cow-pox ‘so nicely !” 
‘And, what was now said? Was the quackery 
exploded, and were the granters of the twenty 
thousand pounds ashamed of what they had done? 
Not at all: the failure was imputed to wnskilful 
operators ; to the staleness of the matter ; to its not 
being of the genwine ali. Admitting all this, 
the scheme stood condemned ; for the great advan- 
tages held forth were, that any body might perform 
the operation, and that the matter was every where 
abundant and cost-free. But these were paltry 
excuses; the mere shuffles of quackery; for what 
do we know now? Why, that in hundreds of in- 
stances, persons cow-poxed by JENNER HIMSELF, 
have taken the real small-pox afterwards, and have 
either died from the disorder, or narrowly escaped 
with their lives! I will mention two instances, the 
parties concerned being living and well-known, one 
of them to the whole nation, and the other to a very 
numerous circle in the higher walks of life. The 
first is Sir Ricnarp Partirs, so well known by his 
able writings, and equally well known by his exem- 
plary conduct as Sheriff of London, and by his life- 
long labours in the cause of real charity and humanity. 
Sir Richard had, I think, two sons, whose veins were 
impregnated by the grantee himself. At any rate he 
had one, who had, several years after Jenner had 
given him the insuring matter, a very hard struggle 
for his life, under the hands of the good, old-fashioned, 
seam-giving, and dimple-dipping small-pox. The 
second is Parrir Copp, Esq., formerly of Bensington, 
and now of Rumsted Court, near Maidstone, in 
COBBETT. AD. Q
-P-A-G-E-228

Kent, who has a son that had a very narrow escape 
under the real small-pox, about four years ago, and 
who also had been cow-poxed by Jenner himself. 
This last-mentioned gentleman I have known, and 
most sincerely respected, from the time of our both 
being about eighteen years of age. When the young 
gentleman, of whom I am now speaking, was very 
oung, I having him upon my knee one day, asked 
Tis kind and excellent mother, whether he had been 
inoculated. ‘Oh, no!’ said she, ‘we are going to 
have him vaccinated. Whereupon I, going into the 
garden to the father, said, ‘I do hope, Codd, that 
‘ou are not going to have that beastly cow-stuff put 
into that fine boy” ‘Why,’ said he, ‘you see, 
Cobbett, it is to be done by Jenner himself’ What 
answer I gave, what names and epithets I bestowed 
upon Jenner and his quackery, I will leave the reader 
to imagine. 
264, Now, here are instances enough; but, every 
reader has heard of, if not seen, scores of others. 
Young Mr. Codd caught the small-pox at a school ; 
and if I recollect rightly, there were several other 
‘vaccinated’ youths who did the same, at the same 
time. Quackery, however, has always a shuffle left. 
Now that the cow-pox has been proved to be no 
guarantee against the small-pox, it makes it ‘ milder” 
when it comes! A pretty shufile, indeed, this! You 
are to be all your life in fear of it, having as your 
sole consolation, that when it comes (and it ma 
overtake you in a camp, or on the seas), it will be 
‘milder !” Tt was not too mild to kill at Rinewoop ; 
and its mildness, in case of young Mr. Codd, did not 
restrain it from blinding him for a suitable number 
of days. I shall not easily forget the alarm and 
anxiety of the father and mother upon this occasion ; 
both of them the best of parents, and both of them

now punished for having yielded to this fashionable 
quackery. I will not say, justly punished; for 
affection for their children, in which respect they 
were never surpassed by any parents on earth, was 
the cause of their listening to the danger-obviating 
quackery. This, too, is the case with other parents ; 
but parents should be under the influence of reason 
and eaperience, as well as under that of affection ; 
and now, at any rate, they ought to set this really 
dangerous quackery at nought. 
265. "And, what does my own experience say on 
the other side? There are my seven children, the 
sons as tall, or nearly so, as their father, and the 
daughters as tall as their mother; all, in due suc- 
cession, inoculated with the good old-fashioned face- 
tearing small-pox ; neither of them with a single 
mark of that disease on their skins; neither of them 
having been, that we could perceive, ill for a single 
hour, in consequence of the inoculation. When we 
were in the United States, we observed that the 
Americans were never marked with the small-pox ; 
or, if such a thing were seen, it was very rarely. 
The cause we found to be, the universal practice 
of having the children inoculated at the breast, and, 
generally, at a month or siw weeks old. When we 
came to have children, we did the same, I be- 
lieve that some of ours have been a few months old 
when the operation has been performed, but always 
while at the breast, and as early as possible after 
the expiration of six weeks from the birth; some- 
times put off a little while by some slight disorder 
in the child, or on account of some circumstance of 
other ; but, with these exceptions, done at, or befores 
the end of six weeks from the birth, and always at 
the breast. All is then : there is nothing ia 
either body or mind to bvour the natural fury of

the disease, We always took particular care about 
the source from which the infectious matter came, 
We employed medical men, in whom we could place 
perfect confidence: we had their solemn word for the 
matter coming from some healthy child; and, at 
last, we had sometimes to wait for this, the cow-affair 
having rendered patients of this sort rather rare. 
266. While the child has the small-pox, the 
mother should abstain from food and drink, which 
she may require at other times, but which might be 
too gross just now. To suckle a hearty child requires 
got living; for, besides that this is neces to 
the mother, it is also necessary to the child. A little 
forbearance, just at this time, is prudent; making 
the diet as simple as possible, and avoiding all violent 
agitation either of the body or the spirits ; avoiding 
too, if you can, very hot or very cold weather. 
267. There is now, however, this inconvenience, 
that the far greater part of the present young 
women have been be-Jennered; so that they may 
catch the beauty-killing disease from their babies! To 
hearten them up, however, and more especially, 
I confess, to record a trait of maternal affection and 
of female heroism, which I have never heard of any 
thing to surpass, I have the pride to say, that my 
wife eight children inoculated at her breast, and 
never had the small-pox in her life. 1, at first, 
objected to the inoculating of the child, but she 
insisted upon it, and with so much pertinacity that 
I gave way, on condition that she would be inocu- 
lated too. This was done with three or four of 
the children, I think, she always being reluctant to 
have it done, saying that it looked like distrusting 
the goodness of God. There was, to be sure, very 
little in this argument ; but the long experience wore 
away the alarm; and there she is now, having had
-P-A-G-E-231
Vv] TO A FATHER 229 
eight children hanging at her breast with that 
desolating disease in them, and she never having 
been affected by it from first to last. All her children 
knew, of course, the risk that she voluntarily in- 
curred for them. They all have this indubitable 
proof, that she valued their lives above her own ; 
and is it in nature, that they should ever wilfully do 
any thing to wound the heart of that mother; and 
must not her bright example have great effect on 
their character and conduct! Now, my opinion is, 
that the far greater part of English or American 
women, if placed in the above circumstances, would 
do just the same thing; and I do hope, that those, 
who have yet to be mothers, will seriously think of 
putting an end, as they have the power to do, to the 
disgraceful and dangerous quackery, the evils of 
which I have so fully proved. 
268. But there is, in the management of babies, 
something besides life, health, strength and beauty ; 
and something too, without which all these put 
together are nothing worth; and that is sanity of 
mind. There are, owing to various causes, some 
who are born ideots; but a great many more be- 
come insane from the misconduct, or neglect, of 
parents; and, generally, from the children being 
committed to the care of servants. I knew, in 
Pennsylvania, a child, as fine, and as sprightly, and 
as intelligent a child as ever was born, made an 
ideot for life by being, when about three years old, 
shut into a dark closet, by a maid servant, in order 
to terrify it into silence. The thoughtless creature 
first menaced it with sending it to ‘the bad place, as 
the phrase is there; and, at last, to reduce it to 
silence, put it into the closet, shut the door, and 
went out of the room. She went back, in a few 
minutes, and found the child in a jit. It recovered

from that, but was for life an ideot. When the 
parents, who had been out two days and two nights 
on a visit of pleasure, came home, they were told 
that the child had had a fit; but, they were not told 
the cause: The girl, however, who was a neigh- 
bour’s daughter, being on her death-bed about ten 
years afterwards, could not die in peace without 
sending for the mother of the child (now become 
a young men) and asking forgiveness of her. 
The ‘mother herself was, however, the greatest 
offender of the two: a whole lifetime of sorrow and 
of mortification was a punishment too light for her 
and her husband, Thousands upon thousands of 
human beings “have been deprived of their senses by 
these and similar means, 
269. It is not long since that we read, in the 
newspapers, of a child being absolutely killed, at 
Birmingham, I think it was, by being thus frightened. 
The parents had gone out into what is called an 
evening party. The servants, naturally enough, had 
their party at home; and the mistress, who, by 
some unexpected accident, had been brought home 
at an early hour, finding the parlour full of company, 
ran up stairs to see about her child, about two or 
three years old. She found it with its eyes open, 
but jized ; touching it, she found it inanimate. e 
doctor was sent for in vain: it was quite dead. The 
maid affected to know nothing of the cause; but 
some one of the ies assembled discovered, pinned 
‘up to the curtains of the bed, a horrid re, made 
up partly of a frightful mask! This, as the 
wretched girl confessed, had been done to keep the 
child guiet, while she was with her company below. 
When one reflects on the anguish that the poor little 
thing must have endured, before the life was quite 
frightened out of it, one can find no terms sufficiently
-P-A-G-E-233
V] TO A FATHER 281 
strong to express the abhorrence due to the per- 
petrator of this crime, which was, in fact, a cruel 
murder ; and, if it was beyond the reach of the law, it 
was so and is so, because, as in the cases of parricide, 
the law, in making no provision for punishment 
peculiarly severe, has, out of respect to human nature, 
supposed such crimes to be impossible. But if the 
girl was criminal; if death, or a life of remorse, was 
her due, what was the due of her parents, and 
especially of the mother! And what was the due of 
the father, who suffered that mother, and who, 
perhaps, tempted her to neglect her most sacred duty ! 
270, If this poor child had been deprived of its 
mental faculties, instead of being deprived of its life, 
the cause would, in all likelihood, never have been 
discovered. The insanity would have been ascribed 
to ‘brain-fever, or to some other of the usual causes 
of insanity; or, as in thousands upon thousands of 
instances, to some unaccountable cause. When I 
was, in No. [X., paragraphs from 227 to 283, both 
inclusive, maintaining with all my might, the un- 
alienable right of the child to the milk of its mother, 
I omitted, amongst the evils arising from banishing 
the child from the mother’s breast, to mention, or, 
rather, it had never occurred to me to mention, the 
loss of reason to the poor, innocent creatures, thus 
banished, And now, as connected with this measure, 
T have an argument of eaperience, enough to terrify 
every young man and woman upon earth from the 
thought of committing this offence against nature. 
- IT wrote No IX. at Camsnivex, on Sunday, the 28th 
of March ; and, before I quitted Surewsgury, on the 
14th of May, the following facts reached my ears. 
A very respectable tradesman, who, with his wife, 
have led a most industrious life, in a town that it 
is not necessary to name, said to a gentleman that
-P-A-G-E-234
282 COBBETT’S ADVICE [Letter 
told it to me: ‘I wish to God I had read No. IX. of 
Mr. Cobbett’s Apvice ro Younc Mun fifteen years 
ago!” He then related, that he had had ten children, 
all put out to be suckled, in consequence of the 
necessity of his having the mother’s assistance to 
carry on his business; and that two out of the ten 
had come home édeots ; though the rest were all sane, 
and though insanity had never been known in the 
family of either father or mother! These parents, 
whom I myself saw, are very clever people, and the 
wife singularly industrious and expert in her affairs. 
271. Now the motive, in this case, unquestionably 
was good; it was that the mother’s valuable time 
might, as much as possible, be devoted to the earning 
of a competence for her children. But, alas! what 
is this competence to these two unfortunate beings ! 
And what is the competence to the rest, when put 
in the scale against the mortification that they must, 
all their lives, suffer on account of the insanity ot 
their brother and sister, exciting, as it must, in all 
their circle, and even in themselves, suspicions of 
their own perfect soundness of mind! When weighed 
against this consideration, what is all the wealth in 
the world! And as to the parents, where are they 
to find compensation for suck a calamity, embittered 
additionally, too, by the reflection, that it was in 
their power to prevent it, and that nature, with loud 
voice, cried out to them to prevent it! Mowry! 
Wealth acquired in consequence of this banishment 
of these poor children; these victims of this, I will 
not call it avarice, but over-eager love of gain! 
wealth, thus acquired! What wealth can console 
these parents for the loss of reason in these children ! 
Where is the father and the mother, who would not 
rather see their children ploughing in other men’s 
fields, and sweeping other men’s houses, than led
-P-A-G-E-235
Vv] TO A. FATHER 233 
about parks or houses of their own, objects of pity 
even of the menials procured by their wealth ? 
272. If what I have now said be not sufficient to 
deter a man from suffering any consideration, no 
matter what, to induce him to delegate the care of 
his children, when very young, to any body whom- 
soever, nothing that I can say can possibly have that 
effect ; and I will, therefore, now proceed to offer my 
advice with regard to the management of children 
when they get beyond the danger of being crazed or 
killed by nurses or servants. 
273, We here come to the subject of education in 
the érue sense of that word, which is rearing up, 
seeing that the word comes from the Latin educo, 
which means to breed up, or to rear up. I shall, 
afterwards, have to speak of education in the now 
common acceptation of the word, which makes it 
mean, book-learning. At present, Iam to speak of 
education in its true sense, as the French (who, as 
well as we, take the word from the Latin) always 
use it. They, in their agricultural works, talk of the 
‘éducation du Cochon, de PAlouette, &c.,’ that is of 
the hog, the lark, and so of other animals; that is to say, 
of the manner of breeding them, or rearing them up, 
from their being little things till they be of full size. 
274, The first thing, in the rearing of children, 
who have passed from the baby-state, is, as to the 
body, plenty of good food; and, as to the mind, 
constant good example in the parents. Of the 
latter I shall speak more by-and-by. With regard 
to the former, it is of the greatest importance, that 
children be well fed; and there never was a greater 
error than to believe that they do not need good 
food. Every one knows, that to have fine horses, 
the colts must be kept well, and that it is the same 
with regard to all animals of every sort and kind,
-P-A-G-E-236
284 COBBETT’S ADVICE [Letter 
The fine horses and cattle and sheep all come from 
the rich pastures. To have them fine, it is not 
sufficient that they have plenty of food when young, 
but that they have rich food. Were there no land, no 
pasture, in England, but such as is found in Middle- 
sex, Essex, and Surrey, we should see none of those 
coach-horses and dray-horses, whose height and size 
make us stare. It is the keep when young that makes 
the fine animal. 
275. There is no other reason for the people in 
the American States being generally so much taller 
and stronger than the people in England are. ‘Their 
forefathers went, for the greater part, from England. 
In the four Northern States they went wholly from 
England, and then, on their landing, they founded 
a new London, a new Falmouth, a new Plymouth, 
a new Portsmouth, a new Dover, a new Yarmouth, 
anew Lynn, a new Boston, and a new Hull, and the 
country itself they called, and their descendants still 
call, New Evctanp. This country of the best and 
boldest seamen, and of the most moral and happy 
people in the world, is also the country of the tallest 
and ablest-bodied men in the world. And why? 
Because, from their very birth, they have an abundance 
of good food; not only of food, but of rick food. 
Even when the child is at the breast, a strip of 
beef-stake, or something of that description, as bi 
and as long as one’s finger, is put into its hands 
When a baby gets a thing in its hand, the first thing it does is to poke some part of it into its mouth. It cannot bite the meat, but its gums squeeze out the juice, When it has done with the breast, it eats meat constantly twice, if not thrice, a day. And this abundance of good food is the cause, to be sure, of the superior size and strength of the people of that country. :
-P-A-G-E-237
Vj TO A FATHER 235 
276. Nor is this, in any point of view, an unim- 
portant matter. A tall man is, whether as labourer, 
carpenter, bricklayer, soldier or sailor, or almost 
anything else, worth more than a short man: he can 
look over a higher thing; he can reach higher and 
wider; he can move on from place to place faster ; 
in mowing grass or corn he takes a wider swarth, 
in pitching he wants a shorter prong; in making 
buildings he does not so soon want a ladder or a 
scaffold; in fighting he keeps his body farther from 
the point of his sword. To be sure, a man may be 
tall and weak; but, this is the exception and not 
the rule: height and weight and strength, in men as 
in speechless animals, generally go together. Aye, 
and in enterprise and courage too, the powers of the 
body have a great deal to do. Doubtless there are, 
have been, and always will be, great numbers of 
small and enterprizing and brave men; but it is not 
in nature, that, generally speaking, those who are con- 
scious of their inferiority in point of bodily strength, 
should possess the boldness of those who have a con- 
trary description. 
277. To what but this difference in the size and 
strength of the opposing combatants are we to 
ascribe the ever-to-be-blushed-at events of our last 
war against the United States! The hearts of our 
seamen and soldiers were as good as those of the 
Yankees: on both sides they had sprung from the 
same stock: on both sides equally well supplied with 
all the materials of war: if on either side, the 
superior skill was on ours: French, Dutch, Spaniards, 
all had confessed our superior prowess: yet, when, 
with our whole undivided strength, and to that 
strength adding the flush and pride of victory and conquest, crowned even in the capital of France; 
when, with all these tremendous advantages, and
-P-A-G-E-238
236 COBBETT’S ADVICE [Letter 
with all the nations of the earth looking on, we came 
foot to foot and yard-arm to yard-arm with the 
Americans, the result was such as an English pen 
refuses to describe. What, then, was the great cause of 
this result, which filled us with shame and the world 
with astonishment? Not the want of courage in our 
men. ‘There were, indeed, some moral causes at 
work ; but the main cause was, the great superiority 
of size and of bodily strength on the part of the 
enemy’s soldiers and sailors. It was so many men on 
each side; but it was men of a different size and 
strength ; and, on the side of the foe, men accustomed 
to daring enterprise from a consciousness of that 
stren, 
278. Why are abstinence and fasting enjoined by 
the Catholic Church? Why, to make men humble, 
meek, and tame ; and they have this effect too: this 
is visible in whole nations as well as in individuals, 
So that good food, and plenty of it, is not more 
necessary to the forming of a stout and able body 
than to the forming of an active and enterprizing 
spirit. Poor food, short allowance, while they check 
the growth of the child’s body, check also the daring 
of the mind; and, therefore, the starving or pinching 
system ought to be avoided by all means. Children 
ould eat often, and as much as they like at a 
time. They will, if at full heap, never take, of ‘plain 
food, more than it is good for them to take. They 
may, indeed, be stuffed with cakes and sweet things 
till they be ill, and, indeed, until they bring on dangerous disorders: but, of meat plainly and well cooked, and of bread, they will never swallow the 
tenth part of an ounce more than it is necessary for them to swallow. Ripe fruit, or cooked fruit, if no 
sweetening take place, will never hurt them; but, 
when they once get a taste for sugary stuff, and to
-P-A-G-E-239
Vj TO A FATHER 287 
cram down loads of garden vegetables ; when ices, 
creams, tarts, raisins, almonds, all the endless pamper- 
ings come, the doctor must soon follow with his 
drugs. The blowing out of the bodies of children 
with tea, coffee, soup, or warm liquids of any kind, 
is very bad: these have an effect precisely like that 
which is produced by feeding young rabbits, or pigs, 
or other young animals upon watery vegetables: it 
makes them big-bellied and bare-boned at the same 
time; and it effectually prevents the frame from 
becoming strong. Children in health want no drink 
other than skim milk, or butter-milk, or whey ; and, 
if none of those be at hand, water will do very well, 
provided they have plenty of good meat. Cheese and 
butter do very well for part of the day. Puddings 
and pies; but always without sugar, which, say what 
people will about the wholesomeness of it, is not only 
of no use in the rearing of children, but injurious : 
it forces an appetite: like strong drink, it makes 
daily encroachments on the taste: it wheedles down 
that which the stomach does not want: it finally 
produces illness: it is one of the curses of the 
country; for it, by taking off the bitter of the tea 
and coffee, is the great cause of sending down into 
the stomach those quantities of warm water by which 
the body is debilitated and deformed and the mind 
enfeebled. Iam addressing myself to persons in the 
middle walk of life; but no parent can be sure that 
his child will not be compelled to labour hard for 
its daily bread: and then, how vast is the difference 
between one who has been pampered with sweets 
and one who has been reared on plain food and simple 
rink ! 
279. The next thing after good and plentiful and 
plain food is good air. This is not within the reach 
of every one; but, to obtain it is worth great sacrifices
-P-A-G-E-240
238 COBBETT’S ADVICE [Letter 
in other respects. We know that there are smells 
which will cause instant death ; we know, that there 
are others which will cause death in a few years; 
and, therefore, we know that it is the duty of parents 
to provide, if possible, against this danger to the 
health of their offspring. To be sure, when a man 
is so situated that Fe cannot give his children sweet 
air without putting himself into a jail for debt: 
when, in short, he has the dire choice of sickly 
children, children with big heads, small limbs, and 
ricketty joints: or children sent to the poor-house : 
' when this is his hard lot, he must decide for the 
former sad alternative: but before he will convince 
me that this is his lot, he must prove to me, that he 
and his wife expend not a penny in the decoration 
of their persons; that on his table, morning, noon, 
or night, nothing ever comes that is not the produce 
of ash soil; that of his time not one hour is 
w in what is called pleasure; that down his 
throat not one drop or morsel ever goes, unless 
necessary to sustain life and health. How many 
scores and how many hundreds of men have I seen ; 
how many thousands could I go and point out, to- 
morrow, in London, the money expended on whose 
puzzlin in porter, grog and wine, would keep, and 
eep well, in the country, a considerable part of the 
year, a wife surrounded by healthy children, instead 
of being stewed up in some alley, or back room, with 
a parcel of poor creatures about her, whom she, 
though their fond mother, is almost ashamed to call 
hers! Compared with the life of such a woman, 
that of the labourer, however poor, is paradise. 
Tell me not of the necessity of providing money for 
them, even if you waste not a farthing : you can provide 
them with no money equal in value to health and 
straight limbs and good looks: these it is, if within
-P-A-G-E-241
Vv] TO A FATHER 239 
your power, your bounden duty to provide for them : 
as to providing them with money, you deceive your- 
self; it is your own avarice, or vanity, that you are 
seeking to gratify, and not to ensure the good of 
your children. eir most precious possession is 
health and strength; and you have no right to run 
the risk of depriving them of these for the sake of 
heaping together money to bestow on them: you 
have the desire to see them rich: it is to gratify 
yourself that you act in such a case; and you, how- 
ever you may deceive yourself, are guilty of injustice 
towards them. You would be ashamed to see them 
without fortune ; but not at all ashamed to see them 
without straight limbs, without colour in their cheeks, 
without strength, without activity, and with only 
half their due portion of reason. 
280. Besides sweet air, children want ezercise, 
Even when they are babies in arms, they want tossing 
and pulling about, and want talking and singing to, 
They should be put upon their feet by slow degrees, 
according to the strength of their 3 and this 
is a matter which a good mother will attend to with 
incessant care. If they appear to-be likely to squint, 
she will, always when they wake up, and frequently 
in the day, teke care to present some pleasing object 
right before, and never on the side of their face. If 
they appear, when they begin to talk, to indicate 
a propensity to stammer, she will stop them, repeat 
the word or words slowly herself, and get them to do 
the same. These precautions are amongst the most 
sacred of the duties of nts; for, remember, the 
deformity is for life ; a thought which will fill every 
good parent’s heart with solicitude. All swaddling 
and tight covering are mischievous, They produce 
distortions of some sort or other, To let children

themselves is a very good way. I never ., 
American with crocked limbs or hump. bes 
never heard any man say that he hat seen one. 
And the reason is, doubtless, the loose dress in which 
children, from the moment of their birth, are kept, 
the good food that they always have, and the sweet 
air that they breathe in consequence of the absence 
of all dread of poverty on the part of the parents, 
281. As to ily exercise, they will, when they 
begin to get about, take, if you let them alone, just 
as much of it as nature bids them, and no more. 
That is a pretty deal, indeed, if they be in health ; 
and, it is your duty, now, to provide for their taking 
of that exercise, when they begin to be what are 
called boys and girls, in a way that shall tend to 
give them the greatest degree of pleasure, accom- 
panied with the smallest risk of pain: in other words, 
to make their lives as pleasant as you possibly can. 
I have always admired the sentiment of Rousszau 
upon this subject. ‘The boy dies, perhaps, at the age 
often or twelve. Of what wse, then, all the restraints, 
all the privations, all the pain, that you have inflicted 
upon him? He falls, and leaves your mind to brood 
over the possibility of your having abridged a life so 
dear to you.” I do not recollect the very words; but 
the passage made a deep impression upon my mind, 
just at the time, too, when I was about to become 
a father; and I was resolved never to bring upon 
myself remorse from such a cause ; a resolution from 
which no importunities, coming from what quarter 
they might, ever induced me, in one single instance, 
or for one single moment, to depart. I was resolved 
to forego all the means of making money, all the 
means of living in any thing like fashion, all the 
means of obtaining fame or distinction, to give up 
every thing, to become a common labourer, rather
-P-A-G-E-243
v] TO A FATHER at 
than make my children lead a life of restraint and 
rebuke ; I could not be sure that my children would 
love me as they loved their own lives ; but I was, at 
any rate, resolved to deserve such love at their hands ; 
and, in possession of that, I felt that I could set 
calamity, of whatever description, at defiance. 
282, Now, proceeding to relate what was, in this 
respect, my line of conduct, I am not pretending that 
every man, and particularly every man living in 
a town, can, in all respects, do as I did in the rearing 
up of children, But, in many respects, any man 
may, whatever may be his state of life. For I did 
not lead an idle life; I had to work constantly for 
the means of living; m occupation required unre- 
mitted attention; I had nothing but my labour to 
rely on; and I had no friend, to whom, in case of 
need, I could fly for assistance: I always saw the 
possibility, and even the probability, of being totally 
ruined by the hand of power; but, happen what 
would, I was resolved, that, as long as I could cause 
them to do it, my children should lead happy lives ; 
and happy lives they did lead, if ever children did 
in this whole world. . 
283, The first thing that I did, when the fourth 
child had come, was to get into the country, and so far 
as to render a going backward and forward to London, 
at short intervals, quite out of the question. Thus 
was health, the greatest of all things, provided for, 
as far as I was able to make the provision. Next, 
my being always at home was secured as far as 
possible; always with them to set an example of 
early rising, sobriety, and application to something 
or other. Children, and especially boys, will have 
some out-of-door pursuits; and it was my duty to 
lead them to choose stich pursuits as combined future utility with present innocence, Each his flower-bed,

little garden, plantation of trees; rabbits, dogs, asses, 
horses, pheasants and hares; hoes, spades, whips, 
guns ; always some object of lively interest, and as 
much earnestness and bustle about the various objects 
as if our living had solely depended upon them. 
I made everything give way to the great object of 
making their lives happy and innocent. I did not 
know what they might be in time, or what might be 
my lot; but I was resolved not to be the cause of 
their being unhappy then, let what might become of 
us afterwards. I was, as I am, of opinion, that it is 
injurious to the mind to press book-learning upon it 
at an early age: I always felt pain for poor little 
things, set up, before ‘company,’ to repeat verses, or 
bits of plays, at six or eight years old. I have 
sometimes not known which way to look, when 
a mother (and, too often, a father), whom I could 
not but respect on account of her fondness for her 
child, has forced the feeble-voiced eighth wonder of 
the world, to stand with its little hand stretched out, 
spouting the soliloquy of Hamlet, or some such thing. 
I remember, on one occasion, a little pale-faced 
creature, only five years old, was brought in, after 
the feeding part of the dinner was over, first to take 
his re half-glass of vintner’s brewings, commonly 
called wine, and then to treat us to a display of his 
wonderful genius. The subject was a speech of 
a robust and bold youth, in a Scotch play, the title 
of which I have forgotten, but the speech 
with, ‘My name is Norval: on the Grampian Hills 
my father fed his flocks...’ And this in a voice 
so weak and distressing as to put me in mind of the 
plaintive squeaking of little pigs when the sow is 
lying on them. As we were going home (one of my 
boys and I) he, after a silence of half a mile perhay 
rode up close to the side of my horse, and said,
-P-A-G-E-245
vi TO A FATHER 243 
‘Papa, where be the Grampian Hills ?’ ‘Oh,’ said I, 
‘they are in Scotland ; poor, barren, beggarly places, 
covered with heath and rushes, ten times as barren 
as Sherril Heath.’ ‘ But,’ said he, ‘how could that 
little boy’s father feed his flocks there, then?’ I was 
ready to tumble off the horse with laughing. 
284, I do not know any thing much more distress- 
ing to the spectators than exhibitions of this sort. 
Every one feels, not for the child, for it is insensible 
to the uneasiness it excites, but for the parents, whose 
amiable fondness displays itself in this ridiculous 
manner. Upon these occasions, no one knows what 
to say, or whither to direct his looks. The parents, 
and especially the fond mother, looks sharply round 
for the so-evidently merited applause, as an actor of 
the name of MunpEn, whom I recollect thirty years 
ago, used, when he had treated us to a witty shrug 
of his shoulders, or twist of his chin, to turn his face 
up to the gallery for the clap. If I had to declare 
on my oath which have been the most disagreeable 
moments of my life, I verily believe, that, after due 
consideration, I should fix upon those, in which 
parents, whom I have respected, have made me 
endure exhibitions like these ; for, this is your choice, 
to be insincere, or to give offence. 
285. And, as towards the child, it is to be unjust, 
thus to teach it to set a high value on trifling, not 
to say mischievous, attainments ; to make it, whether 
it be in its natural disposition or not, vain and con- 
ceited. The plaudits which it receives, in such cases, 
puffs it up in its own thoughts, sends it out into the 
world stuffed with pride and insolence, which must 
and will be extracted out of it by one means or 
another ; and none but those who have had to endure 
the drawing of firmly-fixed teeth, can, I take it, have 
an adequate idea of the painfulness of this operation.

Now, nts have no right thus to indulge their 
own feelings at the risk of the happiness of their 
children. 
286. The great matter is, however, the spoiling eg 
the mind by forcing on it thoughts which it is not fit 
to receive. We know well, we daily sce, that in men, 
as. well as in other animals, the body is rendered 
comparatively small and feeble by being heavily 
loaded, or hard worked, before it arrive at size and 
strength proportioned to such load and such work, 
It is just so with the mind: the attempt to put old 
heads upon young shoulders is just as unreasonable 
as it would be to expect a colt six months old to be 
able to carry a man. The mind, as well as the body, 
requires time to come to its strength; and the way 
to have it possess, at last, its natural strength, is 
not to attempt to joad it too soon i and to favour 
it in its progress iving to the bo od an 
plentiful food, gweot ait, and abundant” exercise, 
accompanied with as little discontent or uneasiness 
as possible. It is universally known, that ailments 
of the body are, in many cases, sufficient to destroy 
the mind, and to debilitate it in innumerable instances. 
It_is equally well known, that the torments of the 
mind are, in many cases, sufficient to destroy the 
body. This, then, being so well known, is it not 
the first duty of a father to secure to his children, if 
possible, sound and strong bodies? Lonp Bacon 
says, that ‘a sound mind in a sound body is the 
greatest of God’s blessings.’ To see his children 
possess these, therefore, ought to be the first object 
with every father; an object which I cannot ‘too 
often endeavour to fix in his mind.

to the means of doing great good to one’s neighbours 
and to one’s country, and, thereby, of adding to 
those pleasant feelings which are, in other words, our 
happiness. But, notwithstanding this, I must here 
insist, and endeavour to impress my opinion upon 
the mind of every father, that his children’s happiness 
ought to be his‘ first object ; that book-learning, if it 
tend to militate against this, ought to be disregarded ; 
and that, as to money, as to fortune, as to rank and 
title, that father who can, in the destination of his 
children, think of them more than of the happiness 
of those children, is, if he be of sane mind, a great 
criminal. Who is there, having lived to the age of 
thirty, or even twenty, years, and having the ordin 
capacity for observation ; who is there, being of this 
description, who must not be convinced of the in- 
adequacy of riches and what are called honours to 
insure happiness? Who, amongst all the classes of 
men, experience, on an average, so little of real 
pleasure, and so much of real pain as the rich and 
the lofty? Por gives us, as the materials for happi- 
ness, ‘health, peace, and competence. Aye, but what is 
peace, and what is competence? If, by peace, he mean 
that tranquillity of mind which innocence and good 
deeds produce, he is right and clear so far; for we 
all know that, without health, which has a well-known 
positive meaning, there can be no happiness. But 
competence is a word of unfixed meaning. It may, 
with some, mean enough to eat, drink, wear and be 
lodged and warmed with; but, with others, it may 
include horses, carriages, and footmen laced over 
from top to toe. So that, here, we have no guide ; 
no standard ; and, indeed, there can be none. But 
as every sensible father must know that the possession 
of riches do not, never did, and never can, afford even
-P-A-G-E-248
246 COBBETT’S ADVICE [Letter 
a chance of additional happiness, it is his duty to inculcate in the minds of his children to make no sacrifice of principle, of moral obligation of any sort, in order to obtain riches, or distinction; and it is 
a duty still more imperative on him, not to expose 
them to the risk of loss of health, or diminution of 
strength, for purposes which have, either directly or 
indirectly, the acquiring of riches in view, whether 
for himself or for them. 
288, With these principles immoveably implanted 
in my mind, I became the father of a family, and on 
these principles I have reared that family. Being 
myself fond of book-learning, and knowing well its 
powers, I naturally wished them to possess it too; but 
never did I impose it upon any one of them. My first 
duty was to make them healthy and strong if I could, 
and to give them as much enjoyment of life as 
possible. Born and bred up in the sweet air myself, 
I was resolved that they should be bred up in it too. 
Enjoying rural scenes and sports, as I had done, 
when a boy, as much as any one that ever was born, 
I was resolved, that they should have the same 
enjoyments tendered to them. When I was a very 
little boy, I was, in the barley-sowing season, going 
along by the side of a field, near Waverty Apney ; 
the primroses and blue-bells bespangling the banks 
on both sides of me; a thousand linnets singing in 
a spreading oak over my head; while the jingle of 
the traces and the whistling of the ploughboys 
saluted my ear from over the hedge; and, as it were 
to snatch me from the enchantment, the hounds, at 
that instant, having started a hare in the hanger on 
the other side of the field, came up scampering over 
it in full cry, taking me after them many a mile. 
I was not more than eight years old; but this parti- 
cular scene has presented itself to my mind many
-P-A-G-E-249
Y] TO A FATHER 247 
times every year from that day to this. I always 
enjoy it over again; and I was resolved to give, if 
possible, the same enjoyments to my children. 
289, Men’s circumstances are so various; there is 
such a great variety in their situations in life, their 
business, the extent of their pecuniary means, the 
local state in which they are placed, their internal 
resources; the variety in all these respects is so 
great, that, as applicable to every family, it would 
be impossible to lay down any set of rules, or 
maxims, touching every matter relating to the 
management and rearing up of children. In giving 
an account, therefore, of my own conduct, in this 
respect, I am not to be understood as supposing, 
that every father can, or ought, to attempt to ie 
the same; but while it will be seen, that there are 
many, and these the most important parts of that 
conduct, that all fathers may imitate, if they choose, 
there is no part of it which thousands and thousands 
of fathers might not adopt and pursue, and adhere 
to, to the very letter. 
290. I effected every thing without scolding, and 
even without command. My children are a family 
of scholars, each sex its appropriate species of learn- 
ing; and, I could safely take my oath, that I never 
ordered a, child of mine, son or daughter, to look into 
a book, in my life. My two eldest sons, when about 
eight years old, were, for the sake of their health, 
placed for a very short time, at a Clergyman’s at 
Micuerpever, and my eldest daughter, a little older, 
at a school a few miles from Botley, to avoid taking 
them to London in the winter.” But, with these 
exceptions, never had they, while children, teacher 
of any description; and I never, and nobody else 
ever, taught any one of them to read, write, or any 
thing else, except in conversation; and, yet, no max

was ever more anxious to be the father of a family of 
clever and learned ons. 
291. I accomplished my purpose indirectly. The 
first thing of all was health, which was secured by 
the deeply-interesting and never-ending sports of the 
Jield and pleasures of the garden, Luckily these 
things were treated of in books and pictures of end- 
less variety ; so that on wet days, in long evenings, 
these came into play. A large, strong table, in 
middle of the room, their mother sitting at her work, 
used to be surrounded with them, the baby, if big 
enough, set up in a high chair. Here were ink- 
stands, pens, pencils, India rubber, and paper, all in 
abundance, and every one scrabbled about as he or 
she pleased. There were prints of animals of all 
sorts; books treating of them: others treating of 
gardening, of flowers, of husbandry, of hunting, 
coursing, shooting, fishing, planting, and, in short, 
of every thing, with to which we had some- 
thing to do. One would be trying to imitate a bit 
of my writing, another drawing the pictures of some 
of our dogs or horses, a third poking over Bewick’s 
Quadru; and picking out what he said about 
them; but our book of never-failing resource was 
the French Maxson Rustievr, or Fanm-Housx, 
which, it is said, was the book that first tempted 
Dvuavesnois (I think that was the name), the famous 
physician, in the reign of Louis XIV., to earn to 
read, Were are all the four-legged animals, from 
the horse down to the mouse, portraits and all; all 
the birds, reptiles, insects ; all the modes of rearing, 
managing, and using the tame ones; all the modes 
of taking the wild ones, and of destroying those 
that are mischievous; all the various traps, springs, 
nets; all the implements of husbandry and garden- 
ing; all the labours of the field and the garden

exhibited, as well as the rest, in plates; and, there 
was I, in my leisure moments, to join this inquisitive 
group, to read the French, and tell them what it 
meaned in English, when the picture did not suffi- 
ciently explain itself. I never have been without 
a copy of this book for forty years, except during 
the time that I was fleeing from the dungeons of 
CasrixergacH and Sipmovrn, in 1817; and, when 
I got to Long Island, the first book I bought was 
another Matson Rusriqvz. 
292. What need had we of schools? What need 
of teachers? What need of scolding and force, to 
induce children to read, write, and love books? 
What need of cards, dice, or of any games, to ‘kill 
time ;” but, in fact, to implant in the infant heart 
a love of gaming, one of the most destructive of all 
human vices? We did not want to ‘kill time:° 
we were always busy, wet weather or dry weather, 
winter or summer. There was no force in any case ; 
no command; no authority; none of these was ever 
wanted. To teach the children the habit of early 
rising was a great object ; and every one knows how 
young people cling to their beds, and how loth they 
are to go to those beds. This was a capital matter ; 
because, here were industry and health both at stake. 
Yet, I avoided command even here; and merely 
offered a reward. The child that was down stairs 
first, was called the Lark for that day ; and, further, 
sat at my right hand at dinner. They soon dis- 
covered, that to rise early, they must go to bed 
early; and thus was this most important object 
secured, with regard to girls as well as boys. 
Nothing more inconvenient, and, indeed, more dis- 
gusting, than to have to do with girls, or young 
women, who lounge in bed: ‘A little more sleep, 
a little more slumber, a little more folding of the
-P-A-G-E-252
250 COBBETT’S ADVICE [Letter 
hands to sleep.’ Soromon knew them well: he had, 
I dare say, seen the breakfast cooling, carriages and 
horses and servants waiting, the sun coming burn- 
ing on, the day wasting, the night growing dark 
too early, appointments broken, and the objects of 
journeys defeated ; and all this from the lolloping in 
bed of persons who ought to have risen with the sun, 
No beauty, no modesty, no accomplishments, are 
a compensation for the effects of laziness in women ; 
and, of all the proofs of laziness, none is so unequi- 
vocal as that of lying late in bed. Love makes 
men overlook this vice (for it is a vice), for a while ; 
but, this does not last for life. Besides, health 
demands early rising: the management of a house 
imperiously demands it; but health, that most 
precious possession, without which there is nothing 
else worth possessing, demands it too. The morning 
. air is the most wholesome and strengthening: even 
in crowded cities, men might do pretty well with 
the aid of the morning air ; but, fow are they to 
rise early, if they go to bed late ? 
298. But, to do the things I did, you must love 
home yourself; to rear up children in this manner, 
you must live with them ; you must make them, too, 
feel, by your conduct, that you prefer this to any 
other mode of passing your time. All men cannot . 
lead this sort of life, but many may; and all much 
more than many do, My occupation, to be sure, 
‘was chiefly carried on at home; but, I had always 
enough to do; I never spent an idle week, or even 
day, in my whole life, Yet I found time to talk 
with them, to walk, or ride, about with them; and 
when forced to go from home, always took one or 
more with me. You must be good-tempered too with 
them; they must like your company better than 
any other person’s; they must not wish you away,
-P-A-G-E-253
Vj TO A FATHER 251 
not fear your coming back, not look upon your 
departure as a holiday. When my business kept 
me away from the scrabbling-table, a petition often 
came, that I would go and. talk with the group, 
and the bearer generally was the youngest, being 
the most likely to succeed. When I went from 
home, all followed me to the outer-gate, and looked 
after me, till the carriage, or horse, was out of 
sight. At the time appointed for my return, all 
were prepared to meet me; and if it were late at 
night, they sat up as long as they were able to 
keep their eyes open. This love of parents, and 
this constant pleasure at home, made them not 
even think of seeking pleasure abroad; and they, 
thus, were kept from vicious playmates and carly 
corruption. 
294. This is the age, too, to teach children to be 
trust-worthy, and to be merciful and humane. We 
lived in a garden of about two acres, partly kitchen- 
garden with walls, partly shrubbery and trees, and 
partly grass. There were the peaches, as tempting as 
any that ever grew, and yet as safe from fingers as if 
no child were ever in the garden. It was not neces- 
to forbid. The blackbirds, the thrushes, the 
whitethroats, and even that very shy bird the gold- 
finch, had their nests and bred up their young-ones, 
in great abundance, all about this little spot, con- 
stantly the play-place of six children; and one of 
the latter had its nest, and brought up its young- 
ones, in a raspberry-bush, within two yards of a walk, 
and at the time that we were gathering the ripe 
raspberries. We give dogs, and justly, great reds 
for sagacity and memory; but the following two 
most curious instances, which I should not venture 
to state, if there were not so many witnesses to the 
facts, in my neighbours at Botley, as well as in my
-P-A-G-E-254
252 COBBETT’S ADVICE {Letter 
own family, will show, that dirds are not, in this 
respect, inferior to the canine race. All country 
people know that the skylark is a very shy bird ; 
that its abode is the open fields: that it settles on 
the ground only ; that it seeks safety in the wideness 
of space ; that it avoids enclosures, and is never seen 
in gardens. A part of our ground was a grass-plat 
of about forty rods, or a quarter of an acre, which, 
one year, was left to be mowed for hay. A pair of 
larks, coming out of the fields into the middle of 
a pretty populous village, chose to make their nest 
in the middle of this little spot, and at not more 
than about thirty-five yards from one of the doors of 
the house, in which there were about twelve persons 
living, and six of those children, who had constant 
access to all parts of the ground. There we saw 
the cock rising up and ringing. then taking his turn 
upon the eggs; and by-and-by, we observed him 
cease to me and saw them both constantly “a 
in bringing. ing food to the young ones. No unintelligible 
hint to fathers and mothers of the human race, who 
have, before marriage, taken delight in music. But 
the time came for mowing the grass! I waited a 
good many days for the brood to get away; but, at 
last, I determined on the day ; and if the larks were 
there still, to leave a patch of grass standing round 
them. In order not to keep them in dread longer 
than necessary, I brought three able mowers, who 
would cut the whole in about an hour; and as the 
lat was nearly circular, set them to mow round, 
beginning at the outside. And now for sagacit: 
indeed! The moment the men began to whet their 
scythes, the two old larks began to flutter over the 
nest, and to make a great clamour. When the men 
an to mow, they flew round and round, stooping 
so low, when near the men, as almost to touch their
-P-A-G-E-255
Vj TO A FATHER 258 
bodies, making a great chattering at the same time ; 
but before the men had got round with the second 
swarth, they flew to the nest, and away they went, 
young ones and all, across the river, at the foot of 
the ground, and settled in the long grass in my 
neighbour's orchard. 
295. The other instance relates to a HOUSE-MARTEN. 
It is well known that these birds build their nests 
under the eaves of inhabited houses, and sometimes 
under those of door porches; but we had one that 
built its nest in the house, and upon the top of a 
common doorcase, the door of which opened into 
a room out of the main into the house. 
Perceiving the marten had begun to build its nest 
here, we pt the front-door open in the daytime ; 
but were obliged to fasten it at night. It went on, 
had eggs, young ones, and the young ones flew. 
used to open the door in the morning early, and 
then the birds carried on their affairs till night. 
The next year the MARTEN came again, and had 
another brood in the same place. Tt found its old 
nest ; and having repaired it, and put it in order, 
went on again in the former way; and it would, 
I dare say, have continued to come to the end of its 
life, if we had remained there so long, notwithstand- 
ing there were six healthy children in the house, 
making just as much noise as they pleased. 
296. Now, what sagacity in these birds, to dis- 
cover that those were places of safety! And how 
happy must it have male us, the ts, to be sure 
that our children had thus deeply imbibed habits 
the contrary of cruelty! For, be it engraven on 
your heart, youne man, that, whatever appearances 
may say to the contrary, cruelty is always accom- 
panied with cowardice, and also with , when 
that is called for by the circumstances of the case;
-P-A-G-E-256
254 COBBETT’S ADVICE [Letter 
and that habitual acts of cruelty to other creatures, 
will, nine times out of ten, produce, when the power 
is possessed, cruelty to human beings. The ill-usage 
of horses, and particularly asses, is a grave and a just 
charge against this nation. No other nation on 
earth is guilty of it to the same extent. Not onl 
by Blows, but by privation, are we cruel towar 
these useful, docile, and patient creatures ; and espe- 
cially towards the last, which is the most docile and 
patient and laborious of the two, while the food that 
satisfies it, is of the coarsest and least costly kind, 
and in quantity so small! In the habitual ill-treat- 
ment of this animal, which, in addition to all its 
labours, has the milk taken from its young ones to 
administer a remedy for our ailments, there is some- 
thing that bespeaks ingratitude hardly to be described. 
In a Rectsrer that I wrote from Long Island, I said, 
that amongst all the things of which I had been 
bereft, I regretted no one so much as a very diminu- 
tive mare, on which my children had all, in succession, 
learned to ride. She was become useless for them, 
and, indeed, for any other purpose; but the recol- 
lection of her was so entwined with so many past 
circumstances, which, at that distance, my mind 
conjured up, that I really was. very uneasy, Test she 
should fall into cruel hands. By good luck, she was, 
after a while, turned out on the wide world to shift 
for herself; and when we got back, and had a place 
for her to stand in, from her native forest we brought 
her to Kensington, and she is now at Barn-Elm, 
about twenty-six years old, and I dare say, as fat as 
a mole. - Now, not only have I no moral right (con- 
sidering my ability to pay for keep) to deprive her 
of life; but it would be wnjust and ungrateful, in me 
to withhold from her sufficient food and lodging to 
make life as pleasant as possible while that life last.
-P-A-G-E-257
Vv] TO A FATHER 255 
297. In the meanwhile the book-learning crept in 
of its own accord, by imperceptible degrees. Chil- 
dren naturally want to be like their nts, and to 
do what they do: the boys following their father, and 
the girls their mother; and as I was always writing 
or reading, mine naturally desired to do somethin; 
in the same way. But, at the same time, they h 
no talk from fools or drinkers ; saw me with no idle, 
gabbling, empty companions; saw no vain and 
affected coxcombs, and no tawdry and extravagant 
women; saw no nasty gormandizing ; and heard no 
gabble about play-houses and romances and the other 
nonsense that fit boys to be lobby-loungers, and 
girls to be the ruin of industrious and frugal young 
men, 
298. We wanted no stimulants of this sort to 
keep up our spirits: our various pleasing pursuits 
were quite sufficient for that ; and the book-learning 
came amongst the rest of the pleasures, to which it 
was, in some sort, necessary. I remember that, one 
ear, I raised a prodigious crop of fine melons, under 
and-glasses; and I learned how to do it from a 
gardening book ; or, at least, that book was necessary 
to remind me of the details, Having passed part of 
an evening in talking to the boys about getting this 
crop, ‘Come,’ said I, ‘now, let us read the book.’ 
Then the book came forth, and to work we went, 
following very strictly the precepts of the book. 
I read the thing but once, but the eldest boy read 
it, perhaps, twenty times over; and explained all 
about the matter to the others, Why here was a 
motive! Then he had to tell the garden-labourer 
what to do to the melons. Now, I will engage, that 
more was really learned by this single lesson, than 
would have been learned by spending, at this son’s 
age, a year at school ; and he happy and delighted all

the while. When any dispute arose amongst them 
about hunting or shooting, or any other of their 
pursuits, they, by degrees, found out the way of 
settling it by reference to some book ; and when any 
difficulty occurred, as to the meaning, they referred 
to me, who, if at home, always instantly attended to 
them, in these matters. 
299. They began writing by taking words out of 
inted books; finding out which letter was which, 
yy asking me, or asking those who knew the letters 
one from another; and by imitating bits of my 
writing, it is surprising how soon they began to 
write a hand like mine, very small, very faint-stroked, 
and nearly plain as print. The first use that any one 
of them made of the pen, was to write to me, though 
in the same house with them. They began doing 
this in mere scratches, before they knew how to make 
any one letter ; and as I was always folding up letters 
and directing them, so were they; and they were 
sure to receive a prompt answer, with most encou- 
raging compliments. ‘All the meddlings and teazings 
of friends, and, what was more serious, the pressing 
prayers of their anxious mother, about sending them 
to school, I withstood without the slightest effect on 
my resolution. As to friends, preferring my own 
judgment to theirs, I did not care much; but an 
expression of anxiety, implying a doubt of the sound- 
ness of my own adoment coming, perhaps, twent: 
times a day from her whose care they were as well 
as mine, was not a matter to smile at, and very great 
trouble it did give me. My answer at last was, as to 
the boys, I want them to be lake me; and as to the 
girls, In whose hands can they be so safe as in yours ? 
Therefore my resolution is taken: go to school they 
shall not. 
300. Nothing is much more annoying than the
-P-A-G-E-259
Vj] TO A FATHER 257 
intermeddling of friends, in a case like this. The 
wife appeals to them, and ‘good breeding, that is to 
say, nonsense, is sure to put them on her side. Then, 
they, particularly the women, when describing the 
surprising progress made by their own sons at school, 
used, if one of mine were present, to turn to him, 
and ask, to what school he went, and phat he was 
learning? _ 1 leave any one to judge of his opinion 
of hers. and whether he would Vike her the Sette 
for that! ‘Bless me, so tall, and not learned any 
thing yet!’ ‘Oh yes, he has,’ I used to say, ‘he has 
learned to ride, and hunt, and shoot, and fish, and 
look after cattle and sheep, and to work in the 
garden, and to feed his dogs, and to go from village 
to village in the dark.’ is was the way I used 
to manage with troublesome customers of this sort. 
And how glad the children used to be, when they 
got clear of such criticising ple! And how 
grateful they felt to me for the protection which 
they saw that I gave them against that state of 
restraint, of which other people’s boys complained ! 
Go whither they might, they found no place so 
pleasant as home, and no soul that came near them 
affording them so many means of gratification as 
they received from me. :

upon me, dragged me from these delights, and 
crammed me into a jail amongst felons; of which 
I shall have to speak more fully, when, in the last 
Number, I come to speak of the duties of THE

of teaching ; for now I was snatched away from the 
only scene in which it could, as I thought, properly 
be executed. But even these difficulties were 
over. The blow was, to be sure, a terrible one; and,

oh God! how was it felt by these poor children! 
It was in the month of July when the horrible 
sentence was passed upon me. My wife, having left 
her children in the care of her good and affectionate 
sister, was in London, waiting to know the doom 
of her husband. When the news arrived at Botley, 
the three boys, one eleven, another nine, and the 
other seven, years old, were hoeing cabbages in that 
garden which had been the source of so much delight. 
‘When the account of the savage sentence was brought 
to them, the youngest could not, for some time, be 
made to understand what a jail was; and, when he 
did, he, all in a tremor, exclaimed, ‘Now I'm sure, 
William, that Para is not in a place like that!’ The 
other, in order to disguise his tears and smother his 
sobs, fell to work with the hoe, and chopped about 
like a blind person. 'This account, when it reached 
me, affected me more, filled me with deeper resent- 
ment, than any other circumstance. And, oh! how 
I despise the wretches who talk of my vindictiveness ; 
of my eaultation at the confusion of those who in-

us. I had a farm in hand. It was necessary that 
I should be constantly informed of what was doing. 
I gave all the orders, whether as to purchases, sales, 
ploughing, sowing, breeding; in short, with regard 
to every thing, and the things were endless in number 
and variety, and always full of interest. My eldest 
son and daughter could now write well and fast. 
One or the other of these was always at Botley; and 
I had with me (having hired the best part of the 
keeper’s house) one or two, besides either this brother 
or sister; the mother coming up to town about once 
in two or three months, leaving the house and 
children in the care of her sister. We had a HAMPER, 
with a lock and two keys, which came up once a 
week, or oftener, bringing me fruit. and sorts of 
country fare, for the carriage of which, cost free,

of the line, looked for with the most lively feelings,

labours, proceedings, and occurrences, written on paper

margins, as to admit of binding. The journal used, when my son was the writer, to be interspersed with 
drawings of our dogs, colts, or any thing that he

wanted me to have a correct idea of. The hamper 
brought me plants, bulbs, and the like, that I might 
see the size of them; and always every one sent his 
or her most beautiful flowers; the earliest violets, 
and primroses, and cowslips, and blue-bells; the 
earliest. twigs of trees; and, in short, every thing 
that they thought calculated to delight me. The 
moment the hamper arrived, I, casting aside every 
thing else, set to work to answer every question, to 
give new directions, and to add anything likely to 
give-pleasure at Botley. Every hamper brought one 
"letter, as they called it, if not more, from every 
child ; and to every letter I wrote an answer, sealed 
up and sent to the party, being sure that that was 
the way to produce other and. better letters; for, 
though they could not read what I wrote, and though 
their own consisted at first of mere scratches, and 
afterwards, for a while, of a few words written down 
for them to imitate, I always thanked them for their 
‘ pretty letter’ ; and never expressed any wish to see 
em write better; but took care to write in a very 
neat and plain hand myself, and to do up my letter 
in a very neat manner.

doomed to incessant mortification, and to rage that

callous hearts of those tigers were strangers. ‘ Heaven 
first taught letters for some wretch’s aid: How often 
did this line of Pope occur to me when I opened the

French, I used, for a part of the two years, to send 
them a few hours in the day to an Azpx, who lived 
in Castle-street, Holborn, All this was a great 
relaxation to my mind; and, when I had to return 
to my literary labours, I returned fresh and cheerful, 
full of vigour, and full of hope, of finally seeing my 
unjust and merciless foes at my feet, and that, too, 
without caring a straw on whom their fall might 
bring calamity, so that my own family were safe ; 
because, say what any one. might, the community, 
taken as a whole, had suffered this thing to be done. 
"505. “The f the work-people, the k 305. The paying of the work- e, the keepi 
of the accounts, the referring to books, the writing 
and reading of letters; this everlasting mixture of 
amusement with book-learning, made me, almost to 
my own surprise, find, at the end of the two years, 
that I had a parcel of scholars growing up about 
me; and, long before the end of the time, I had 
dictated many Registers to my two eldest children. 
Then, there was copying out of books, which taught 
spelling correctly. "The calculations about the farming 
affairs forced arithmetic upon us: the wse, the neces- 
sity, of the thing, led to the study. By-and-by, we 
had to look into the Jaws to know what to do about 
the highways, about the game, about the poor, and 
all rural and parochial affairs. I was, indeed, by 
the fangs of the government, defeated in my fondly- 
cherished project of making my sons farmers on their 
own land, and keeping them from all temptation to 
seek vicious and enervating enjoyments; but those 
fangs, merciless as they had been, had not been able 
to prevent me from laying in for their lives a store 
of useful information, habits of industry, care, so- 
briety, and a taste for innocent, healthful, and manly 
pleasures: the fangs had made me and them penny-

less; but, they had not been able to take from us 
our health or our mental possessions; and these 
were ready for application as circumstances might 
ordain, 
306. After the age that I have now been speaking 
of, fourteen, I suppose every one became a reader and 
writer according to fancy. As to books, with the 
exception of the Poets, I never bought, in my whole 
life, any one that I did not want for some purpose 
of utility, and of practical utility too. I have two 
or three times had the whole collection snatched 
away from me; and have begun again to get them 
together as they were wanted. Go and kick an 
Anr’s nest about, and you will see the little laborious, 
courageous creatures mstantly set to work to get it 
together again; and if you do this ten times over, 
ten times over they will do the same. Here is the 
sort of stuff that men must be made of to oppose, 
with success, those who, by whatever means, get 
possession of t and mischievous power. : 
307. Now, 1 am aware, that that which I did, 
cannot be done by every one of hundreds of thou- 
sands of fathers, each of whom loves his children 
with all his soul: I am aware that the attorney, the 
surgeon, the physician, the trader, and even the 
farmer, cannot, generally speaking, do what I did, 
and that they must, in most cases, send their sons 
to school, if it be necessary for them to have book- 
learning. But while I say this, I know, that there 
are many things, which t aia, which many fathers 
might do, and which, nevertheless, they do not do. 
It is in the power of every father to live at home with 
his family, when not compelled by business, or by 
public duty, to be absent: it is in his power to set 
an example of industry and sobriety and frugality, 
and to prevent a taste for gaming, dissipation, ex-

travagance, from getting root in the minds of his 
children: it is in his power to continue to make 
his children hearers, when he is reproving servants 
for idleness, or commending them Tor industry and 
care: it is in his power to keep all dissolute and 
idly-talking companions from his house: it is in his 
power to teach them, by his uniform example, justice 
and mercy towards the inferior animals: it is in his 
power to do many other things, and something in 
the way of book-learning too, however busy his life 
may be. It is completely within his power to teach 
them early-rising and early going to bed; and, if 
many a man, who says that he has not time to teach 
his children, were to sit down, in sincerity, with a 
pen and a bit of paper, and put down all the 
minutes, which he, in every twenty-four hours, wastes 
over the bottle, or over cheese and oranges and raisins 
and biscuits, after he has dined ; how many he lounges 
away, either at the coffee-house or at home, over the 
useless part of newspapers; how many he spends in 
waiting for the coming and the managing of the 
tea-table; how many he passes by candle-light, 
wearied of his existence, when he might be in bed ; 
how many he passes’ in the morning in bed, while 
the sun and dew shine and sparkle for him in vain : 
if he were to put all these together, and were to 
add those which he passes in reading of books 
for his mere personal amusement, and without the 
smallest chance of acquiring from them any useful 
practical knowledge: if he were to sum up the whole 
of these, and add to them the time worse than 
wasted in the contemptible work of dressing off his 
person, he would be frightened at the result; would 
send for his boys from school; and if greater book- 
learning than he possessed were necessary, he would 
choose for the purpose some man of ability, and see

the teaching carried on under his own roof, with 
safety as to morals, and with the best chance as to 
health, 308. If after all, however, a school must be re- 
sorted to, let it, if in your power, be as little populous 
as possible, As ‘evil communications corrupt good 
manners,’ so the more numerous the assemblage, and 
the more extensive the communication, the greater 
the chance of corruption. Jails, barracks, factories, 
do not corrupt by their wails, but by their condensed 
numbers. Populous cities corrupt from the same 
cause; and it is, because it must be, the same with 
regard to schools, out of which children come not 
what they were when they went in. The master is, 
in some sort, their enemy ; he is their overlooker ; he 
is a spy upon them; his authority is maintained 
by his absolute power of punishment; the parent 
commits them to that power; to be taught is to be 
held in restraint ; and, as the sparks fly upwards, the 
ing and the restraint will not be divided in 
the estimation of the boy. Besides all this, there 
is the great disadvantage of tardiness in arriving at 
years of discretion. If boys live only with boys, 
their ideas will continue to be boyish; if they 
see and hear and converse with nobody but boys, how 
are they to have the thoughts and the character of 
men? It is, at last, only by hearing men talk and 
seeing men act, that they learn to talk and act like 
men ; and, therefore, to confine them to the society of 
boys, is to retard their arrival at the years of dis- 
cretion ; and in case of adverse circumstances in the 
pecuniary way, where, in all the creation, is there so 
pless ‘a mortal as a boy who has always been at 
school! But, if, as I said before, a school there must 
be, let the congregation be as small as possible ; and, 
do not expect too much from the master ; for, if it

be irksome to you to teach your own sons, what 
must. that. teaching be to him? If he have great 
numbers, he must delegate his authority; and, like 
all other delegated authority, it will either be abused 
or neglected, 
309. With regard to girls, one would think that 
mothers would want no argument to make them 
shudder at the thought of committing the care of 
their daughters to other hands than their own. If 
fortune have so favoured them as to make them 
rationally desirous that their daughters should have 
more of what are called accomplishments than they 
themselves have, it has also favoured them with the 
means of having teachers under their own eye. If 
it have not favoured them so highly as this (and it 
seldom has in the middle rank of life), what duty 
so sacred as that imposed on a mother to be the 
teacher of her daughters! And is she, from love of 
ease or of pleasure or of any thing else, to neglect 
this duty; is she to commit her daughters to the 
care of persons, with whose manners and morals it is 
impossible for her to be thoroughly acquainted ; 
is she to send them into the promiscuous society of 
girls, who belong to nobody knows whom, and come 
from nobody knows whither, and some of whom, for 
aught she can know to the contrary, may have been 
corrupted before, and sent thither to be hidden from 
their former circle; is she to send her daughters to 
be shut up within walls, the bare sight of which 
awaken the idea of intrigue and invite to seduction 
and surrender; is she to leave the health of her 
daughters to chance, to shut them up with a motley 
bevy of strangers, some of whon, as is Sre ly the 
case, are proclaimed bastards, by the undeniable 
testimony given by the colour of their skin ; is she 
to do all this, and still put forward pretensions to
-P-A-G-E-268
266 COBBETT’S ADVICE [Letter 
the authority and the affection due to a mother! 
And, are you to permit all this, and still call yourself 
a father! 
810. Well, then, having resolved to teach your 
own children, or, to have them taught, at home, let 
us now see how they ought to proceed as to books for 
learning. It is evident, speaking of boys, that, at 
last, they must study the art, or science, that you 
intend them to pursue; if they be to be surgeons, 
they must read ks on surgery; and the like in 
other cases. But, there are certain elementary studies ; 
certain books to be used by all persons, who are 
destined to acquire any book-learning at all. ‘Then 
there are departments, or branches of knowledge, that 
every man in the middle rank of life, ought, if he 
can, to acquire, they being, in some sort, necessary to 
his reputation as a well-informed man, a character 
to which the farmer and the shopkeeper ought to 
aspire as well as the lawyer and the surgeon. Let 
me now, then, offer my advice as to the course of 
reading, and the manner of reading, for a boy, arrived 
at his fourteenth year, that being, in my opinion, 
early enough for him to begin. 
811. And, first of all, whether as to boys or girls, 
I deprecate romances of every description. It is 
impossible that they can do any good, and they may 
do a great deal of harm. They excite passions that 
ought to lie dormant ; they give the mind a taste for 
ighly-seasoned matter; they make matters of real 
life insipid ; every girl, addicted to them, sighs to be 
a Sornia Wesrern, and every boy, a Tom Jones, 
What girl is not in love with the wild youth, and 
what boy does not find a justification for his wild- 
ness ? t can be more pernicious than the teach- 
ings of this celebrated romance? Here are two 
young men put before us, both sons of the same
-P-A-G-E-269
v] TO A FATHER 267 
mother; the one a bastard (and by a parson too), the 
other a Legitimate child ; the former wild, disobedient, 
and squandering ; the latter steady, sober, obedient, 
and frugal; the former every thing that is frank and 
generous in his nature, the latter a greedy hypocrite ; 
the former rewarded with the most beautiful and 
virtuous of women and a double estate, the latter 
punished by being made an outcast. How is it 
possible for young people to read such a book, and 
to look upon orderliness, sobriety, obedience, and fru- 
gality, as virtues? And this is the tenor of almost 
every romance, and of almost every play, in our 
language. In the ‘School for Scandal,’ for instance, 
we see two brothers; the one a prudent and frugal 
man, and, to all appearance, a moral man, the other 
a hair-brained squanderer, laughing at the morality 
of his brother; the former turns out to be a base 
hypocrite and seducer, and is brought to shame and 
disgrace; while the latter is found to be full of 
generous sentiment, and Heaven itself seems to inter- 
fere to give him fortune and fame. In short, the 
direct tendency of the far greater part of these books, 
is, to cause young people to despise all those virtues, 
without the practice of which they must be a curse 
to their parents, a burden to the community, and 
must, except by mere accident, lead wretched lives. 
I do not recollect one romance nor one play, in our 
language, which has not this tendency. How is it 
possible for young princes to read the historical plays 
of the punning and smutty Shakspeare, and not 
think, that to drunkards, blackguards, the com- 
panions of debauchees and robbers, is the suitable 
ginning of a glorious reign ? 
. 312. There is, too, another most abominable prin- 
ciple that runs through them all, namely, that there 
is in high birth, something of superior nature, in-
-P-A-G-E-270
268 COBBETT’S ADVICE (Letter 
stinctive courage, honour, and talent. Who can look 
at the two royal youths in Cymsetine, or at the noble 
youth in Doueras, without detesting the base para- 
sites who wrote those plays? Here are youths, 
brought up by shepherds, never told of their origin, 
believing themselves the sons of these humble parents, 
but discovering, when grown up, the highest notions 
of valour and honour, and thirsting for military 
renown, even while tending their reputed fathers’ 
. flocks and herds! And, why this species of false- 
hood? 'To cheat the mass of the people; to keep 
them in abject subjection; to make them quietly 
submit to despotic sway, And the infamous authors 
are guilty of the cheat, because they are, in one 
shape or another, paid by oppressors out of means 
squeezed from the people. A true picture would 
give us just the reverse; would show us that ‘high 
birth” is the enemy of virtue, of valour, and of talent; 
would show us, that with all their incalculable 
advantages, royal and noble families have, only by 
mere accident, produced a great man; that, in 
general, they have been amongst the most effeminate, 
unprincipled, cowardly, stupid, and, at the very 
least, amongst the most useless persons, considered 
as individuals, and not in connexion with the pre- 
rogatives and powers bestowed on them solely by 
the law, 
. $18, It is impossible for me, by any words that 
I can use, to express, to the extent of my thoughts, 
the danger of. suffering young people to form their 
opinions from the writings of poets and romances. 
Nine times out of ten, the morality they teach is 
bad, and must have a bad tendency. ‘Their wit 
is employed to ridicule virtue, as you will almost 
always find, if you examine the matter to the bottom. 
The world owes a very large part of its sufferings to
-P-A-G-E-271
Vv) TO A FATHER 269 
tyrants; but what tyrant was there amongst the 
ancients, whom the poets did not place amongst the 
gods? Can you open an English poet, without, in some part or other of his works, finding the grossest 
flatteries of royal and noble persons? How are 
young people not to think that the praises bestowed 
on these persons are just? Drypen, Parner, Gay, 
Tuomson, in short, what poet have we had, or have 
we, Pore only excepted, who was not, or is not, 
a pensioner, or a sinecure placeman, or the wretched 
dependent of some part of the Aristocracy? Of the 
extent of the powers of. writers in producing mischief 
to a nation, we have two most striking instances in 
the cases of Dr. Jounson and Burxe. The. former, 
at a time when it was a question whether war should 
be made on America to compel her to submit to be 
taxed by the English parliament, wrote a pamphlet, 
entitled, ‘Taxation no Tyranny, to urge the nation 
into that war. The latter, when it was a question, 
whether England should wage war against the people 
of France, to prevent them from reforming their 
government, wrote a pamphlet to urge the nation 
into that war. The first war lost us America, the 
last cost us six hundred millions of money, and has 
loaded us with forty millions a year of taxes. Jonn- 
son, however, got a pension for his life, and Burks 
a pension for his life, and for three lives after his own ! 
Cumsertanp and Morrny, the play-writers, were 
pensioners; and, in short, of the whole mass, where 
there been one, whom the people were not com- 
pelled to pay for labours, having for their principal 
object the deceiving and enslaving of that same 
people? It is, therefore, the duty of every father, 
when he puts a book into the hands of his son or 
daughter, to give the reader a true account of who 
and what the writer of the book was, or is. :

$14. If a boy be intended for any particular call- 
ing, he ought, of course, to be induced to read books 
relating to that calling, if such books there be; and, 
therefore, I shall not be more particular on that 
head. But, there are certain things, that all men in 
' the middle rank of life, ought to know something of ; 
because the knowledge will be a source of pleasure ; 
and because the want of it must, very frequently, 
give them pain, by making them appear inferior, in 
point of mind, to many who are, in fact, their infe- 
riors in that respect. These things are grammar, 
arithmetic, history, accompanied with geography. 
Without these, a man, in the middle rank of life, 
however able he may be in his calling, makes but an 
awkward figure. Without grammar he cannot, with 
safety to his character as a well-informed man, put 
his thoughts upon paper; nor can he be sure, that. he 
is speaking with propriety. How many clever men 
have I known, full of natural talent, eloquent by 
nature, replete with every thing calculated to give 
them weight in society; and yet having little or no 
weight, merely because unable to put correctly upon 
paper that which they have in their minds! For me 
not to say, that I deem my English Grammar the 
best. book for teaching this science, would be affecta- 
tion, and neglect of duty besides; because I know, 
that it is the best ; because J wrote it for the purpose 3 
and because, hundreds and hundreds of men and 
women have told me, some verbally, and some by 
letter, that, though (many of them) at grammar 
schools for years, they really never knew any thing of 
grammar, until they studied my book. I, who know 
well all the difficulties that I experienced when I read books upon the subject, can easily believe this, and especially when I think of the numerous instances in 
which I have seen wniversity-scholars unable to write
-P-A-G-E-273
vj TO A FATHER 271 
English, with any tolerable degree of correctness. In 
this book, the principles are so clearly explained, that 
the disgust arising from intricacy is avoided ; and it 
is this disgust, that is the great and mortal enemy of 
acquiring knowledge. 
15. With regard to arirameric, it is a branch 
of learning absolutely necessary to every one, who 
has any pecuniary transactions beyond those arising 
out of the expenditure of his week’s wages. All the 
books on this subject that I had ever seen, were so 
bad, so destitute of every thing calculated to lead 
the mind into a knowl of the matter, so void 
of principles, and so evidently tending to puzzle and 
disgust the learner, by their sententious, and crabbed, 
and quaint, and almost hieroglyphical definitions, 
that t at one time, had the intention of writin 
a little work on the subject myself. It was put off 
from one cause or another ; but a little work on the 
subject has been, partly at my suggestion, written 
and published by Mr. Tuomas Smita of Liverpool, 
and is sold by Mr. SxHerwoop, in London. The 
author has great ability, and a perfect knowledge 
of his subject. It is a book of Principles and 
any youn; n of common capacity, will learn 
more from fein a week, than from, all the other 
books, that I ever saw on the subject, in a twelve- 
month, : 
316. While the foregoing studies are proceeding, 
though they very well afford a relief to each other, 
HISTORY may serve as a relaxation, particularly during 
the study of grammar, which is an undertaking 
requiring patience and time. Of all history, that 
of our own country is of the most importance; 
because, for want of a thorough knowledge of what 
has been, we are, in many cases, at a loss to account 
for what is, and still more at a loss, to be able to
-P-A-G-E-274
22 COBBETT’S ADVICE [Letter 
show what ought to be. The difference between 
history and romance is this; that that which is 
narrated in the latter, leaves in the mind nothing 
which it can apply to present or future circumstances 
and events; while the former, when it is what: it 
ought to be, leaves the mind stored with arguments 
for experience, applicable, at all times, to the actual 
affairs of life. The history of a country ought to 
show the origin and progress of its institutions, 
political, civil, and ecclesiastical ; it ought to show 
the effects of those institutions upon the state of the 
people; it ought to delineate the measures of the 
government at the several epochs; and, having 
clearly described the state of the people at the 
several periods, it ought to show the cause of their 
freedom, good morals, and happiness; or of their 
misery, immorality, and slavery; and this, too, by 
the production of indubitable facts, and of inferences 
so manifestly fair, as to leave not the smallest doubt 
upon the mind. 
317. Do the histories of England which we have, 
answer this description? They are very little better 
than romances. ‘Their contents are generally con- 
fined to narrations relating to battles, negociations, 
intrigues, contests between rival sovereignties, rival 
nobles, and to the character of kings, queens, 
mistresses, bishops, ministers, and the like; from 
scarcely any of which can the reader draw any 
knowledge which is at all applicable to the circum- 
stances of the present day. 
818. Besides this, there is the fulschood; and the falsehoods contained in these histories, where shall 
we find any thing to surpass? Let us take one 
instance, The a tell us, that William the Con- 
queror knocked down twenty-six parish churches, and laid waste the parishes in order to make the
-P-A-G-E-275
Vv] TO A FATHER 278 
New Forest ; and this in a tract of the very poorest 
land in England, where the churches must then 
have stood at about one mile and two hundred 
yards from each other. The truth is, that all the 
churches are still standing that were there when 
William landed, and the whole story is a sheer 
falsehood from the beginning to the end. 
319, But, this is a mere specimen of these 
romances; and that too, with regard to a matter 
comparatively unimportant to us. The important 
falsehoods are, those which misguide us by state- 
ment or by inference, with regard to the state of 
the people at the several epochs, as produced by the 
institutions of the country, or the measures of the 
Government. It is always the object of those who 
have power in their hands, to persuade the people 
that they are better off than their forefathers were: 
it is the great business of history to show how this 
matter stands; and, with respect to this great 
matter, what are we to learn from any thing that 
has hitherto been called a history of England! 
T remember, that, about a dozen years ago, I was 
talking with a very clever young man, who had 
read twice or thrice over the History of England, 
by different authors; and that I gave the conversa- 
tion a turn that drew from him, unperceived 
by himself, that he did not know how tithes, 
parishes, poor-rates, church-rates, and the abolition 
of trial by jury in hundreds of cases, came to be 
in England ; and, that he had not the smallest idea 
of the manner in which the Duke of Bedford came 
to possess the power of taxing our cabbages in 
Covent-Garden, Pet, this is history. I have done 
a great deal, with regard to matters of this sort, in 
my famous History of the Prorzsranr Rerorma- 
tion; for I may truly call that famous, which has

been translated and published in all the modern 
$20. Bat, it is reserved for me to write a complete 
history of the country from the earliest times to the 
resent day; and this; God giving me life and 
Pealth, I shall begin to do in monthly numbers, 
beginning on the first of September, and in which 
I shall endeavour to combine brevity with clearness, 
We do not want to consume our time over a dozen 
about Edward the Third dancing at a ball, 
picking up a lady’s garter, and making that 
the foundation of an order of knighthood, bearing 
the motto of ‘ Honi soit qui mal y pense. It is not 
stuff like this; but we want to know what was the 
state of the ple; what were a labourer’s wages ; 
what were fe prices of the food, and how the 
labourers were dressed in the reign of that great 
king. What is a young person to imbibe from a 
history of England, as it is called, like that of Gold- 
smith? It is a little romance to amuse children; 
and the other historians have given us larger 
romances to amuse lazy persons who are grown up. 
To destroy the effects of these, and to make the 
people know what their country has been, will be 
my object; and this, I trust, I shall effect. We 
are, it is said, to have a History of England from 
Sm James Macxintosn; a History of Scotland from 
Sm Watrer Scorr; and a History or IrELanp

323, When people have nothing useful to do, they 
may indulge their curiosity; but, merely to read 
books, is not to be industrious, is not to study, and 
is not the way to become learned. Perhaps there 
are none more lazy, or more truly ignorant, than 
your everlasting readers. A book is an admirable 
excuse for sitting still; and, a man who has con- 
stantly a newspaper, a magazine, a review, or some 
book ‘or other in his hand, gets, at last, his head 
stuffed with such a jumble, that he knows not what 
to think about any thing. An empty coxcomb, that - 
wastes his time in dressing, strutting, or strolling 
about, and picking his teeth, is certainly a most 
despicable creature, but scarcely less so than a mere 
ler of books, who is, generally, conceited, thinks 
himself wiser than other men, in proportion to the 
number of leaves that he has turned over. In short, 
a young man should bestow his time upon no book, 
~the contents of which he cannot apply to some 
useful purpose,

books for ever, and be an ignorant creature at last,

825. And, with regard to young women, ever- 
lasting book-reading is absolutely a vice. When 
they once get into the habit, they neglect all other 
matters, and, in some cases, even their very dress. 
Attending to the affairs of the house : to the washing, 
the baking, the brewing, the preservation and cook- 
ing of victuals, the management of the poultry and 
the garden; these are their proper occupations. It 
is said (with what truth I know not) of the present 
Queen (wife of William IV), that she was an active, 
excellent manager of her house. Impossible to 
bestow on her greater praise; and I trust that her 
example will have its due effect on the young women 
of the present day, who stand, but too generally, in 
need of that example. 
326. The great fault of the present generation, 
is, that, in all ranks, the notions of self-importance 
are too high. 'This has arisen from causes not visible 
to many, but the consequences are felt by all, and 
that, too, with great severity. There has been a 
general sublimating going on for many years. Not 
to put the word Msgquire before the name of almost 
any man who is not a mere labourer or artisan, is 
almost an affront. Every merchant, every master- 
manufacturer, every dealer, if at all rich, is an 
Esquire ; squires’ sons must be gentlemen, and squires’ 
wives and daughters ladies, If this were all; if it 
were merely a ridiculous misapplication of words, the 
evil would not be great; but, unhappily, words lead 
to acts and produce things; and the ‘young gentle- 
man’ is not easily to be moulded into a tradesman or 
a working farmer, And yet the world is too small 
to hold so many gentlemen and ladies. How many

‘thousands of young meni have, at this moment, cause 
to lament that they are not carpenters, or masons, or 
tailors, or shoemakers ; and how many thousands of 
those, that they have been bred up to wish to dis- 
ise their honest and useful, and therefore honour- 
able, calling! Rousseau observes, that men are 
happy, first, in proportion to their virtue, and 
next, in proportion to their independence; and 
that, of all mankind, the artisan, or craftsman, 
is the most independent; because he carries about, 
in his own hands and person, the means of gaining 
his livelihood ; and that the more common the use 
of the articles on which he works, the more perfect 
his independence. ‘Where,’ says he, ‘there is one 
man that stands in need of the talents of the dentist, 
there are a hundred thousand that want those of the 
people who supply the matter for the teeth to work 
on; and for one who wants a sonnet to regale his 
fancy, there are a million clamouring for men to 
make ‘or mend their shoes.” Aye, and this is the 
reason, why shoemakers are proverbially the most 
independent part of the people, and why they, in 
general, show more public spirit than any other men. 
He who lives by a pursuit, be it what it may, which 
does not require a considerable degree of bodily labour, 
must, from the nature of things, be, more or less, 
a dependent ; and this is, indeed, the price which he 
pays for his exemption from that bodily labour. He 
arrive at riches, or fame, or both; and_ this 
chance he sets against the -certainty of independence 
in humbler life, There always have been, there 
always will be, and there always ought to be, some 
men to take this chance; but to do this has become 
the fashion, and a fashion it is the most fatal that 
ever seized upon a community. 
827, With regard: to young women, too, to sing,
-P-A-G-E-281
Vj TO A FATHER 279 
to play on instruments of music, to draw, to speak 
French, and the like, are very agreeable qualifica- 
tions; but why should they aiJ be musicians, and 
painters, and linguists? Why all of them? Who, 
then, is there left to take care of the houses of farmers 
and traders? But there is something in these 
‘accomplishments’ worse than this; namely, that 
they think themselves too high for farmers and 
traders: and this, in fact, they are; much too high ; 
and, therefore, the servant-girls step in and supply 
their place. If they could see their own interest, 
surely they would drop this lofty tone, and these 
lofty airs. It is, however, the fault of the parents, 
and particularly of the father, whose duty it is to 
prevent them from imbibing such notions, and to 
show them, that the greatest honour they ought 
to aspire to is, thorough skill and care in the 
economy of a house, We are all apt to set too 
high a value on what we ourselves have done; and 
I may do this; but I do firmly believe, that to cure 
any young woman of this fatel sublimation, she has 
only patiently to read my Corracr Economy, written 
with an anxious desire to promote domestic skill 
and ability in that sex, on whom so much of the 
happiness of man must always depend. A lady in 
Worcestershire. told me, that until she read Corrace 
Economy she had never baked in the house, and had 
seldom had good beer; that, ever since, she had 
looked after both herself; that the pleasure she 
had derived from it, was equal to the profit, and that 
the latter was very great. She said, that the article 
‘on baking bread,’ was the part that roused her to 
the undertaking; and, ind if the facts and argu- 
ments, there made use of, failed to stir her up to 
nection, she must have been stone dead to the power 
of words, :

328, After the age that we have now been suppos- 
ing, boys and girls become men and women; and, 
there now only remains for the father to act towards 
them with impartiality. If they be numerous, or, 
indeed, if they be onh two in number, to expect 
‘ect harmony to reign amongst, or between, them, 
is to be unreasonable; because experience shows us, 
that, even amongst the most sober, most virtuous, 
and most sensible, harmony $0 complete is very rare. 
By nature they are rivals for the affection and 
applause of the parents; in personal and mental 
chlowments they me rivals; and, when i 
interests come to be well understood and to have 
their weight, here is a rivalship, to prevent which 
from ending in hostility, require more affection and 
greater disinterestedness than fall to the lot of one 
out of one hundred families. So many instances 
have I witnessed of good and amiable families 
living in harmony, till the hour arrived for dividing 
property amongst them, and then, all at once, be- 
coming hostile to each other, that I have often 
thought that property, coming in such a way, was 
a curse, and that the parties would have been far 
better off, had the parent had merely a blessing to 
bequeath them from his or her lips, instead of a will 
for them to dispute and wrangle over. 
929, With regard to this matter, all that the 
father can do, is to be impartial; but, impartiality 
does not mean positive equality in the distribution, 
but equality in proportion to the different deserts 
of the parties, their different wants, their different 
pecuniary circumstances, and different prospects in 
ife; and these vary so much, in different families, 
that it is impossi le to lay down any general rule 
upon the subject. But there is one fatal error, 
against which every father ought to guard his heart ;
-P-A-G-E-283
vj TO A FATHER 281 
and the kinder that heart is, the more necessary such 
guardianship. I mean the fatal error of heaping 
upon one child, to the prejudice of the rest; or, 
upon a part of them. Ts partiality sometimes 
arises from mere caprice; sometimes from the circum- 
stance of the favourite being more favoured by 
nature than the rest; sometimes from the nearer 
resemblance to himself, that the father sees in the 
favourite; and, sometimes, from the hope of 
preventing the favoured party from doing that 
which would disgrace the parent. AII these motives 
are highly censurable, but the last is the most 
gen and by far the most mischievous in its 
effects. How many fathers have been ruined, how 
many mothers and families brought to beggary, how 
many industrious and virtuous groups have been 
pulled down from competence to penury, from the 
desire to prevent one from bringing shame on the 
t! So that, contrary to every principle of 
justice, the bad is rewarded for the badness; and 
the good punished for the goodness, Natural 
affection, remembrance of infantine endearments, 
reluctance to abandon long-cherished hopes, com- 
passion for the sufferings of your own flesh and blood, 
the dread of fatal consequences from your adhering 
to justice ; all these beat at your heart, and call on 
you to give way: but, you must resist them all ; 
or, your ruin, and that of the rest of your family, 
are decreed. Suffering is the natural and just punish. 
ment of idleness, drunkenness, squandering, and an 
indulgence in the society of prostitutes; and, never 
did the world behold an instance of an offender, in 
this way, reclaimed but yy the infliction of this 
punishment ; particularly, if the society of prostitutes 
made part of the offence; for, here is something 
that takes the heart from you. Nobody ever yet

saw, and nobody ever will see, a young man, linked 
to a prostitute, and retain, at the same time, any, 
even the smallest degree of affection, for parents or 
brethren. You may supplicate, you may implore, 
you may leave yourself pennyless, and your virtuous 
children without bread ; the invisible cormorant will 
still call for more; and, as we saw, only the other 
day, a wretch was convicted of having, at the insti- 
gation of his prostitute, beaten his aged mother, to 
get from her the small remains of the means neces- 
sary to provide her with food. In Hxron’s col- 
lection of God’s judgments on wicked acts, it is 
related of an unnatural son, who fed his aged father 
upon orts and offal, lodged him in a filthy and crazy 
garret, and clothed him in sackcloth, while he and 
his wife and children lived in luxury; that, having 
bought sackcloth enough for two dresses for his 
father, the children took away the part not made up, 
and hid it, and that, upon asking them what they 
could do this for, they told him that they meant 
to keep it for him, when he should become old and 
walk with a stick! This, the author relates, pierced 
his heart ; and, indeed, if this failed, he must have 
had the heart of a tiger; but, even this would not 
succeed with the associate of a prostitute. When 
this vice, this love of the society of prostitutes ; 
when this vice has once got fast hold, vain are all 
your sacrifices, vain your prayers, vain your hopes, 
vain your anxious desire to disguise the shame from the world; and, if you have acted well your part, no part of that shame falls on you, unless you have administered to the cause of it. Your authority has ceased; the voice of the prostitute, or the charms 
of the bottle, or the rattle ofthe dice, has been more 
werful than: your advice and example: you must ament this: but, it isnot to bow you down; and,
-P-A-G-E-285
Vv] TO A FATHER 283 
above all things, it is weak, and even criminally 
selfish, to sacrifice the rest of your family, in order 
to keep from the world the knowledge of that, which, 
if known, would, in your view of the matter, bring 
shame on yourself. 
330. Let me hope, however, that this is a calamity 
which will befall very few good fathers; and that, 
of all such, the sober, industrious, and frugal habits 
of their children, their dutiful demeanor, their truth 
and their integrity, will come to smooth the path 
of their downward days, and be the objects on which 
their eyes will close. Those children must, in their 
turn, travel the same path ; and they may be assured, 
that, ‘Honour thy father and thy mother, that thy 
days may be long in the land, is a precept, a disre- 
gard of which never yet failed, either first or last, 
to bring its punishment. And, what can be more 
just than that signal punishment should follow such 
acrime; a crime directly against the voice of nature 
itself? Youth has its passions, and due allowance 
justice will make for these; but, are the delusions of 
the boozer, the gamester, or the harlot, to be pleaded 
in excuse for a disregard of the source of your 
existence? Are those to be pleaded in apology for 
giving pain to the father who has toiled half a life- 
time in order to feed and clothe you, and to the 
mother whose breast has been to you the fountain of 
life? Go, you, and shake the hand of the boon- 
companion; take the greedy harlot to your arms; 
mock at the tears of your tender and anxious parents ; 
and, when your purse is empty and your complexion 
faded, receive the poverty and the scorn due to your 
base ingratitude !

TO THE CITIZEN 
331. Havine now given my Advice to the Yours; 
- the grown-up Man, the Lover, the Hussanp and the 
Farner, I shall, in this concluding Number, tender 
my Advice to the Crmzrx, in which capacity every 
man has rights to enjoy and duties to perform, and 
these too of importance not inferior to those which 
belong to him, or are imposed upon him, as son, 
it, husband or father. The word ciftzen is not, 
in its application, confined to the mere inhabitants 
of cities: it means, a member of a civil society, or 
ity; and, in order to have a clear compre- 
hension of man’s rights and duties in this capacity, 
we must take a look at the origin of civil com- 
munities. 
832. Time was when the inhabitants of this island, 
for instance, laid claim to all things in it, without 
the words owner or property being known. had 
given to all the people all the land and all the trees, 
and every thing else, just as he has given the burrows 
and the grass to the rabbits, and the bushes and the 
berries to the birds; and each man had the good 
things. of this world in a greater or less degree in 
proportion to his skill, his strength and his valour. 
is what is called avin under the Law or 
Nature; that is to say, the law of self-preservation 
and self-enjoyment, without any restraint imposed 
bya regard for the good of our neighbours,
-P-A-G-E-287
COBBETT’S ADVICE TO A CITIZEN 285 
333. In process of time, no matter from what 
cause, men made amongst themselves a compact, or 
an agreement, to divide the land and its products in 
such manner that each should have a s! to his 
own exclusive use, and that each man should be 
protected in the exclusive enjoyment of his share by 
the wnited power of the rest; and, in order to ensure 
the due and certain application of this united power, 
the whole of the people agreed to be bound by regu- 
lations, called.Laws. Thus arose civil society ; thus 
arose property ; thus arose the words mine and thine. 
One man became possessed of more good things than 
another, because he was more industrious, more skil- 
fal, more careful, or more frugal: so that Lazour, of 
one sort or another, was the sasis of all property. 
334, In what manner civil societies proceeded in 
providing for the making of laws and for the enfore- 
ing of them; the various ways in which they took 
measures to protect the weak against the strong; 
how they have gone to work to secure wealth against 
the attacks of poverty; these are subjects that it 
would require volumes to detail; but these truths 
are written on the heart of man: that all men are, 
by nature, equal; that civil society can never have 
arisen from any motive other than that of the beng 
of the whole; that, whenever civil society makes the 
greater part of the people worse off than they were 
under the Law of Nature, the civil compact is, in 
conscience, dissolved, and all the rights of nature 
return ; that, in civil society, the rights and the duties 
go hand in hand, and that, when the former are 
taken away, the latter cease to exist. 
335. Now, then, in order to act well our part, as 
citizens, or members of the community, we ought 
clearly to understand what our rights are ; for, on 
our enjoyment of these depend our duties, rights
-P-A-G-E-288
286 COBBETT’S ADVICE [Letter 
going before duties, as value received goes before 
ayment. I know-well, that just the contrary of: this 
is taught in our political schools, where we are told, 
that our first duty is to obey the laws; and it is not 
many years ago, that Hoxstxy, Bishop of Rochester, 
told us, that the people had nothing to do with the 
laws but to obey them. The truth is, however, that 
the citizen’s first duty is to maintain his rights, as it 
is. the purchaser’s first duty to receive the thing for 
which he has contracted. 
836. Our rights in society are numerous ; the right 
of enjoying life and property; the right of exerting 
our physical and mental powers in an innocent 
manner; but, the great right of all, and without 
which there is, in fact, no right, is, the right of taking 
@ part in the making of the laws by which we are 
werned. "This right is founded in that law of 
ature spoken of above; it springs out of the very 
principle of civil society; for what compact, what 
t, what common assent, can possibly be 
imagined by which men would give up all the rights 
of nature, all the free enjoyment of their bodies and 
their minds, in order to subject. themselves to rules 
and laws, in the making of which they should have 
nothing to say, and which should be enforced upon 
them without their assent ? The Breat right, there- 
fore, of every man, the right of rights, is the right of 
having a share in the making of the laws, to which 
the good of the whole makes it his duty to submit. 
887. With regard to the means of enabling every 
man to enjoy this share, they. have been different, in 
different countries, and, in the same countries, at 
different times, Generally it has been, and in great 
communities it- must be, by the choosing of a few to

VI] TO A CITIZEN 287 
assembled for any purpose whatever, where fact and 
argument are to decide the question, the decision is 
left to the majority, the compact being that the 
decision of the majority shall be that of the whole. 
Minors are excluded from this right, because the. law 
considers them as infants, because it makes the 
parent answerable for civil damages committed by 
them, and because of their legal incapacity to make 
any compact. Women are excluded because husbands 
are answerable in law for their wives, as to their civil 
damages, and because the very nature of their sex 
makes the exercise of this right incompatible with 
the harmony and happiness of society. Men stained 
with andelible crimes are excluded, because they have 
forfeited their right by violating the laws, to which 
their assent has been given. Insane persons are 
excluded, because they are dead in the eye of the 
law, because the law demands no duty at their hands, 
because they cannot violate the law, because the law 
cannot affect them; and, therefore, they ought to 
have no hand in making it. 
338. But, with these exceptions, where is the 
ground whereon to maintain that any man ought to 
be deprived of this right, which he derives directly 
from the law of Nature, and which springs, as I said 
before, out of the same source with civil society itself? 
Am I told, that property ought to confer this right ? 
Property sprang from labour, and not labour 
property 5 so that if there were to be a distinction 
ere, it ought to give the preference to labour. All 
men are equal by nature; nobody denies that they 
all ought to be equal in the eye of the law ; but, how 
are they to be thus equal, if the law begin by suffer- 
ing some to enjoy this right and refusing the enjoyment 
to others? It is the duty of every man to defend his 
country against an enemy, a duty imposed by the

law of Nature as well as by that of civil society, and without the recognition of this duty, there could exist no independent nation and no civil society. Yet, how are you to maintain that this is the duty of every man, if you deny to some men the enjoyment 
of a share in making the laws? Upon what principle are you to contend for equality here, while you deny 
its existence as to the right of sharing in the making 
of the laws? The poor man has a body and a soul 
as well as the rich man; like the latter, he has 
parents, wife and children ; a bullet or a sword is as 
deadly to him as to the rich man; there are hearts 
to ache and tears to flow for him as well as for the 
squire or the lord or the loan-monger: yet, notwith- 
standing this equality, he is to risk all, and, if he 
escape, he is sti to be denied an equality of rights! 
If, in such a state of things, the artisan or labourer, 
when called out to fight in defence of his country, 
were to answer: ‘Why should I risk my life? Ihave 
no possession but my dabour ; no enemy will take that 
from me; you, the rich, possess all the land and all 
its products; you make what laws you Please without 
my participation or assent; you punish me at your 
pleasure; you say that my want of property excludes 
me from the right of having a share in the making of 
the laws; you say that the property that I have in 
my labour is nothing worth ; on what ground, then, 
do you call on me to risk my life?’ If, in such 
a case, such questions were put, the answer is very 
difficult to be imagined. 339, In cases of civil commotion the matter comes 
still more home to us. On what ground is the rich man to call the artisan from his shop or the labourer from the field to join the sheriff's possé or the militia, if he refuse to the labourer and artisan the right of sharing in the making of the laws? Why are they
-P-A-G-E-291
  Vij TO A CITIZEN 289 
to risk their lives here? ‘To uphold the laws, and to 
protect property, What! laws, in the making of, or 
assenting to, which they have been allowed to have 
no share? Property, of which they are said to 
possess none? What! compel men to come forth 
and risk their lives for the protection of property ; 
and then, in the same breath, tell them, that they 
are not allowed to share in the making of the laws,

degrading appellation is applied? A very poor man; 
a man who is, from some cause or other, unable to 
supply himself with food and raiment without aid from the parish-rates, And, is that circumstance 
alone to deprive him of his right, a right of which he 
stands more in need than any other man? _Perha

clear out the London meat-markets and the drapérs’ 
and jewellers’ shops in about half an hour: to this 
law the parson wished the parliament to leave the 
poorest of the working People s but, if the parlia- 
ment had done it, it would have been quickly seen,

341. Trusting that it is unnecessary for me to 
express a hope, that barbarous thoughts like those 
of Malthus and his tribe will never be entertained by 
any j Fours man who has read the previous Numbers 
of this work, let me return to my very, very poor 
man, and ask, whether it be consistent with justice, 
with humanity, with reason, to deprive a man of the 
most precious of his political rights, because, and 
only because, he has been, in a pecuniary way, singu- 
larly unfortunate? 'The Scripture says, ‘ Despise not 
the poor, because he is poor ;’ that is to say, despise 
him not on account of his poverty. 'y, then, 
deprive him of his right; why put him out of the 
pale of the law, on account of his poverty? There 
are some men, to be sure, who are reduced to poverty 
by their vices, by idleness, by gaming, by drinking, 
by squandering ; but, the far greater part by bodily

ailments, by misfortunes to the effects of which all 
men may, without any fault, and even without any 
folly, be exposed: and, is there a man on earth so 
cruelly unjust as to wish to add to the sufferings 
of such persons by stripping them. of their political 
rights? How many thousands of industrious and 
virtuous men have, within these few years, 
brought down from a state of competence to that of 
pauperism! And, is it just to strip such men of their 
rights, merely because they are thus brought down ? 
‘When I was at Exy, last spring, there were in that 
neigh bohoed: three paupers cracking stones on the 
who had all three been, not only rate-payers, 
but overseers of the poor, within seven years of the 
day when I was there. Is there any man so bar- 
barous as to say, that these men ought, merely on 
account of their misfortunes, to be deprived of their 
political rights? Their right-to receive relief is as 
perfect: as any right of property; and, would you, 
merely because they claim this right, strip them of 
another right? To say no more of the injustice and 
the cruelty, is there reason, is there common sense in 
this? at! if a farmer or tradesman be, by flood 
or by fire, so totally ruined as to be compelled, 
surrounded by his family, to resort to the parish- 
book, would you break the last heart-string of such 
aman by making him feel the degrading loss of his 
political rights ? 
$42. Here, young man of sense and of spirit; here 
és the point on which you are to take your stand. 
There are always men enough to plead the cause of 
the rich; enough and enough to echo the woes of 
the fallen great; but, be it your part to show com- 
passion for those who labour, and to maintain their 
rights, Poverty is not a crime, and, though it some- times arises from faults, it is not, even in that case,

to be visited by punishment beyond that which it 
brings with itself, Remember, that poverty ‘is 
decreed. by the very nature of man. The Scripture 
says, that ‘the poor shall never cease from out of 
the land ;* that is to say, that there shall always be 
some very poor people. This is inevitable from the 
very nature of things. It is necessary to the exist~ 
ence of mankind, that a very large portion of evel 
people should live by manual labour ; and, as suc! 
labour is pain, more or less, and as no living creature 
likes pain, it must be, that the far greater part of 
labouring people will endure only just as much of 
this pain as is absolutely necessary to the supply of 
their daily wants. Experience says that this has 
always been, and reason and nature tell us, that this 
must always be. Therefore, when ailments, when 
losses, when untoward circumstances of any sort, 
stop or diminish the dai y supply, want comes; and ~ 
every just government wil provi e, from the general 
stock, the means to satisfy this want. 
343. Nor is the deepest poverty without its useful 
effects in society. To the practice of the virtues of 
abstinence, sobriety, care, frugality, industry, and 
even. honesty and amiable manners and acquirement 
of talent, the two great motives are, to get upwards 
in riches or fame; and to avoid going downwards to 
poverty, the last of which is the most powerful of the 
two. It is, therefore, not with contempt, but with 
compassion, ‘that we should. look on those, ‘whose 
state’ is.one of the decrees of nature, from whose sad 
example we profit, and to whom, in return, we ought 
to make compensation by every indulgent and kind act. in our power, and particularly by a defence of 
their rights. ‘To those who labour, we, who labour 
not with ‘our -hands, owe all that we eat, drink and 
wear; all that shades us by day and that shelters us

by night; all the means of enjoying health and 
pleasure ; and, therefore, if we possess talent for. the 
task, we are ungrateful or cowardly, or both, if we 
omit any effort within our power to. prevent them 
from being slaves; and, disguise the matter how we 
may, a slave, a real slave, every man is, who has no 
share in making the laws which he is compelled to 
obey. : 
344. What is a slave? -For, let us not be amused 
by a name ; but look well into the matter. A slave 
is, in the first place, a man who has no property ; and 
property means something that he has, and that 
nobody can take from him without his leave,. or 
consent. Whatever man, no matter what he may 
call himself or any body else may call him, can have 
his money or his goods taken from him by force, by 
virtue of an order, or ordinance, ‘or law, which he 
has had no hand in making, and to which he has 
not given his assent, has no property, and is merely 
a depositary of the goods of his master. A slave has no 
property in his labour; and any man who is compelled 
to give up the fruit of his labour to another, at the 
arbitrary will of that other, has no property in his 
labour, and is, therefore, a slave, whether the fruit of 
his labour be taken from him directly or indirectly. 
If it be said, that he gives up this fruit of his labour 
by his own will, and that it is not forced from him. 
Tanswer, To be sure he may avoid eating and drink- 
ing and may go naked; but, then he must die; and 
on this condition, and this condition only, can he 
refuse to give up the fruit of his labour ; ‘ Die, wretch, 
or surrender as much of your income, or the fruit. of 
our labour as your masters choose to take.’ This 
is, in fact, the language of the rulers to every man 
who is refused to have a share in the making of the 
Jaws to which he is forced to submit. : oo
-P-A-G-E-296
294 COBBETT’S ADVICE [Letter 
345. But, some one may say, slaves are private 
property, and may be t and sold, out and out, 
like cattle. And, what is it to the slave, whether 
he be property of one or of many ; or, what matters 
it to him, whether he pass from master to master by 
a sale for an indefinite term, or be let to hire by the 
years month, or week ? It is, in no case, the flesh and 
lood and bones that are sold, but the /abour ; and, 
if you actually sell the labour of man, is not that 
man a slave, though you sell it for only a short time 
at once? And, as to the principle, so ostentatiously 
displayed in the case of the black slave-trade, that 
‘man ought not to havea property in man, it is 
even an advantage to the slave. to be private 
property, because the owner has then a clear and 
powerful interest in the preservation of his life, 
ealth and strength, and will, therefore, furnish him 
amply with the food and raiment necessary for these 
ends, Every one knows, that public property is 
never so well taken care of as private property ; and 
this, too, on the maxim, that ‘that which is every 
body’s business is obody’s business.” Every one 
knows that a rented farm is not so well kept in 
heart, as a farm in the hands of the owner. . And, 
as to punishments and restraints, what difference is 
there, whether these be inflicted and imposed by 
a private owner, or his overseer, or by the agents 
and. overseers of a body of proprietors? In short, 
if you can cause a man to be imprisoned or whipped 
if he do not work enough to please you ; if you can 
sell him by auction for a time limited; if you can 
forcibly separate him from his wife to prevent their 
having children; if you can shut him up in his. 
dwelling place when you please, and for as long 
a time as you please; if you can force him to draw 
a cart or wagon like a beast of draught ; if you can,
-P-A-G-E-297
VI] TO A CITIZEN 295 
when the humour seizes you, and at the suggestion 
of your mere fears, or whim, cause him to be shut 
up in a dungeon during your pleasure: if you can, 
at yor pleasure, do these things to him, is it not 
to be impudently hypocritical to affect to call him 
a free-man? But, after all, these may all be wanting, 
and yet the man pe a slave, if he be allowed to have 
no property; and, as I have shown, no_propert: 
he can have, not even in that labour, which eS net 
only property, but the basis of all other property, 
unless he have a share in making the laws to which 
he is compelled to submit. 
846. It is said, that he may have this share 
virtually though not in form and name; for that 
his employers may have such share, and they will, 
as a matter of course, act for him. This doctrine, 
pushed home, would make the chief of the nation 
the sole maker of the laws; for, if the rich can thus 
act for the poor, why should not the chief act for 
the rich? This matter is very completely explained . 
by the practice in the Unrrep Srares or America. 
here the maxim is, that every free man, with the 
exception of men stained with crime and men insane, 
has a right to have a voice in choosing those who 
make the laws. The. number of Representatives 
sent to the Congress is, in each State, proportioned 
to the number of free people. But, as there are slaves 
in some of the States, these States have a certain 
portion of additional numbers on account of those 
slaves! Thus the slaves are represented by their 
owners ; and this is real, practical, open and undis- 
guised virtual representation! No doubt that white 
men may be represented in the same way; for the 
colour of the skin is nothing; but let them be called 
slaves, then; let it not be pretended that they are 
Sree men; let not the word liberty be polluted by
-P-A-G-E-298
296 COBBETT’S ADVICE [Letter 
being applied to their state; let it be openly and 
honestly avowed, as in America, that they are slaves; 
and then will come the question whether men ought 
to exist in such a state, or whether they ought to 
do every thing in their power to rescue themselves 
m it. 
847, If the right to have a share in making the 
laws were merely a feather; if it were a fanciful 
thing; if it were only a speculative theory; if it 
were but an abstract principle; on any of these 
suppositions, it might be considered as of little 
importance. But it is none of these; it is a practical 
matter; the want of it not only és, but must of 
necessity be, felt by every man who lives under that 
want. If it were proposed to the shopkeepers in 
a town, that a rich man or two, living in the 
neighbourhood, should have power to send, whenever 
they pleased, and take away as much as they pleased 
of the money of the shopkeepers, and apply it to 
what uses they please; what an outcry the shop- 
keepers would make! And yet, what would this be 
more: than taxes imposed on those who have no 
voice in choosing the persons who impose them? 
Who lets another man put his hand into his purse 
when he pleases? Who, that has the power to help 
himself, surrenders his goods or his money to the 
will of another? Has it not always been, and must 
it not always be, true, that, if your property be 
at the absolute disposal of others, your ruin is 
certain? And if this be, of necessity, the case 
amongst individuals and parts of the community; 
it must be the case with regard to the whole com- 
mNBUS, Aye, and ‘ . Aye, and experience shows us that it always has been the case. The natural and inevitable consequences of a want of this right in the people
-P-A-G-E-299
VI] TO A CITIZEN 297 
have, in all countries, been tazes pressing the 
industrious and laborious to the earth; severe laws 
and standing armies to compel the people to submit to those taxes; wealth, Taxury, and splendour. 
amongst those who make the laws and receive 
the taxes; poverty, misery, immorality and crime, 
amongst those who bear the burdens; and at last 
commotion, revolt, revenge, and rivers of blood. 
Such have always been, and such must always be, 
the consequences of a want of this right of all men 
to’ share in the making of the laws, a right, as 
I have before shown, derived immediately from the 
law of Nature, springing up out of the'same source with civil society, and cherished in the heart of man 
by reason and by experience. 
349. Well, then, this right being that, without 
the enjoyment of which there is, in reality, no right 
at all, how manifestly is it the first duty of every 
man to do all in his power to maintain this right 
where it exists, and to restore it where it has been 
lost? For observe, it must, at one time, have existed 
in every civil community, it being impossible that 
it could ever be excluded by any social compact ; 
absolutely impossible, because it is contrary to the 
law of self-preservation to believe, that men would 
agree to give up the rights of nature without stipu- 
lating for some benefit. Before we can affect to 
believe that this right was not reserved, in such 
compact, as completely as the right to live was 
reserved, we must affect to believe, that millions of 
mén, under no control but that of their own passions 
and desires, and having all the earth and its products 
at the command of their. strength and skill, con- 
sented to be for ever, they and their posterity, the 
slaves of a few. : 
350. We- cannot believe this, and therefore,
-P-A-G-E-300
298 COBBETT’S ADVICE [Letter 
without. going back into history and precedents, we 
must believe, that, in whatever civil community this 
right does not exist, it has been lost, or rather, 
justly taken away. And then, having seen the 
terrible evils which always have arisen, and always 
must arise, from the want of it; being convinced 
that, where lost or taken away by force or fraud, 
it is our very first duty to do all in our power to 
restore it, the next consideration is, how one ought 
to act in the discharge of this most sacred duty ; 
for sacred it is even as the duties of husband and 
father. For, besides the baseness of the thought 
of quietly submitting to be a slave oneself, we have 
here, besides our duty to the community, a duty 
to perform towards our children and our children’s 
children. We all acknowledge that it is our bounden 
duty to provide, as far as our power will go, for the 
competence, the health, and the good character of 
our children; but, is this duty superior to that 
of which I am now speaking? What is competence, 
what is health, if the possessor be @ slave, and hold 
his possessions at the will of another, or others; as 
he must do if destitute of the right to a share in 
the making of the laws? What is competence, 
what is health, if both can, at any moment, be 
snatched away by the grasp or the dungeon of a 
master; and his master he is who makes the laws 
without his participation or assent? And, as to 
character, as to fair fame, when the white slave 
puts forward pretensions to those, let him no longer 
affect to commiserate the state of his sleek and fat 
brethren in Barbadoes and Jamaica; let him hasten 
to mix the hair with the wool, to blend the white 
with the black, and to lose the memory of his origin amidst a dingy generation. 
851. Such, then, being ‘the nature of the duty,
-P-A-G-E-301
Vij TO A CITIZEN 299 
how are we to go to work in the performance of 
it, and what are our means? With to these, 
so various are the circumstances, so endless the differ- 
ences in the states of society, and so many are the 
cases when it would be madness to attempt that 
which it would be prudence to attempt in others, 
that no general rule can be given beyend this ;, that, 
the right and the duty being clear to our minds, the 
means that are surest and swiftest are the best. In 
every such case, however, the great and predominant 
desire ought to be not to employ any means beyond 
those of reason and persuasion, as long as the employ- 
ment of these afford a ground for rational expectation 
of success. Men are, in such a case, labouring, not 
for the present day only, but for ages to come; and 
therefore they should not slacken in their exertions, 
because the grave may close upon them before the 
day of final triumph arrive. Amongst the virtues of 
the good Citizen are those of fortitude and patience ; 
and, when he has to on his struggle against 
corruptions deep and widely-rooted, he is not to 
expect the baleful tree to come down at a single 
blow; he must patiently remove the earth that 
props and feeds it, and sever the accursed roots one 
one. 
"352. Impatience here is a very bad sign. I do 
not like your patriots, who, because the tree does 
not give way at once, fall to blaming all about them, 
accuse their fellow-sufferers of cowardice, because 
they do not do that which they themselves dare not 
think of doing. Such conduct argues chagrin and 
disappointment ; and these argue a selfish feeling: 
they argue, that there has been more of private 
ambition and gain at work than of public good. 
Such blamers, such general accusers, are always to 
be suspected. What does the real patriot want
-P-A-G-E-302
800 COBBETT’S ADVICE [Letter 
more than to feel conscious that -he has done his 
duty towards his country; and that, if life should 
not allow him time to see his endeavours crowned 
with success, his children will see it? The impatient 
triots are like the young men (mentioned in the 
Peantifal fable of La Fontaine) who ridiculed the 
man of fourscore, who was planting an avenue of 
very small trees, which, they told him, that he never 
could expect to see as high as his head. ‘Well,’ 
said he, ‘and what of that? If their shade afford 
me no pleasure, it may afford pleasure to my children, 
and even to you; and, therefore, the planting of 
them gives me pleasure.’ 
353. Itis the want of the noble disinterestedness, so 
beautifully expressed in this fable, that produces the 
impatient patriots. They wish very well to their 
country, because they want some of the good for 
themselves. Very natural that all men should wish 
to see the good arrive, and-wish to share in it too ; 
but, we must look on the dark side of nature to find 
the disposition to cast blame on the whole communit 
because our wishes are not instantly accomplished, 
and especially to cast blame on others for not doing 
that which we ourselves dare not attempt. There 
is, however, a sort of patriot a t deal worse than 
this; he, who having failed himself, would see his 
country enslaved for ever, rather than see its deliver- 
ance achieved by others. His failure has, perhaps, 
arisen solely from his want of talent, or discretion ; 
his selfish heart would wish his country sunk in 
everlasting degradation, lest his inefficiency for the 
task should -be established by the success of others, 
‘A very hateful character, certainly, but, I am so 
to say, by no means rare. Envy, always associated 
with meanness of soul, always detestable, is never so 
detestable as when it shows itself here.

354, Be it your care, my young friend (and I tender 
you this as my parting advice), if you find this base 
and baleful passion, which. the poet calls ‘the eldest 
born of hell ;’ if you find it creeping into your heart, 
be it your care to banish it at once and. for ever ; 
for, if once it nestle there, farewell to all the good 
which nature has enabled you to do, and to your 
peace into the bargain. It has pleased God to make 
an unequal distribution of talent, of industry, of 
perseverance, of a capacity to labour, of all. the 
qualities that give men distinction. We have not 
been our own'makers: it is no fault in you that 
nature has placed him above you, and, surely, it is 
no-fault in-him; and would you punish him on 
account, and only on account, of his pre-eminence! 
If you have read this book you will startle with 
horror at the thought: you will, as to public 
matters, act with zeal and with good humour, 
though the place you occupy be far removed from 
the first; you will support with the best of. your 
abilities others, who, from whatever circumstance, 
may happen to take the lead; you will not suffer 
even-the consciousness and the certainty of-your own 
saperior talents to urge you to do any thing which 
might by possibility be injurious te your country’s 
cause; you will be forbearing under the aggres- 
sions of ignorance, conceit, arrogance, and even. the 
blackest of ingratitude superadded, if by reseriting 
these you endanger the general good; and, above 
all things, you will have the justice to bear in mind, 
that that.country which gave you birth, is, to the 
last hour of your capability, entitled to your exertions 
in her behalf, and.'that you ought not, by aets of

soil is a feeling which nature has implanted in the 
human breast, and that has always been peculiarly 
strong in the breasts of Englishmen. God has given 
us a country of which to be proud, and that freedom, 
greatness and renown, which were handed down to 
us by our wise and brave forefathers, bid us perish 
to the last man, rather than suffer the land of their 
ves to become a land of slavery, impotence and 
ishonour, 
355. In the words with which I concluded my 
English Grammar, which I addressed to my son 
James, I conclude my advice to you. ‘With English 
and French on your tongue and in your pen, you 
have a resource, not only greatly valuable in itself, 
but a resource that you can be deprived of by none 
of those changes and chances which deprive men of 
pecuniary possessions, and which, in some cases, 
make the purse-proud man of yesterday a crawling 
syoophant to-day. Health, without which life is 
not worth having, you will hardly fail to secure 
by early rising, exercise, sobriety, and abstemious- 
.ness as to food. Happiness, or misery, is in the mind. 
It is the mind that lives; and the length of 
life ought to be measured by the number and 
importance of our ideas, and not by the number 
of our days. Never, therefore, esteem men merely: 
on account of their riches or their station. Respect 
find it where you may. Honour talent 
wherever you behold it unassociated with vice; but, 
honour it most when accompanied with exertion, 
and especially when exerted in the cause of truth 
and justice; and, above all things, hold it in 
honour, when it steps forward to protect defence- 
less innocence against the attacks of powerful guilt.’ 
These words, to my own son, I now, in 
taking my ‘leave, address to you. Be just, be

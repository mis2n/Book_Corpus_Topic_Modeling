  PREFACE 
This book is written for those who have to do with people, 
“especially with children. It brings to parents and teachers 
information of value regarding social conduct. Recent 
sciences that treat human behavior have been making great 
progress in the understanding of human nature. This is 
fortunate because we need all the help science can give 
in dealing with behavior problems, since society is con- 
stantly becoming more complicated, and wholesome social 
conduct increasingly difficult. 
At a time when any science is advancing rapidly, it is 
particularly hard to make a systematic application of its 
findings, because they are continually being changed. This 
is the case just now in the field of social science. If one 
waits for a settlement of all the matters in dispute, little 
use can be made of an important gathering of information. 
Although the new understanding of human conduct has 
barely begun, enough has already been accomplished to 
blaze a trail which parents and teachers can profitably fol- 
low in their guidance of children. This book attempts to 
make the trail more usable by combining short, discon- 
nected trails, clearing away confusing undergrowth, plainly 
designating impassable by-paths, and giving full directions 
for steady progress, with the least possible impedimenta. 
Supplementary readings have been provided for the reader 
who wishes to explore for himself, in the rapidly develop- 
ing science of conduct. These references have been chosen 
as those most likely to be available and helpful to the 
student, and not for the purpose of making a formidable 
list. For the most part, the citations are recent, the excep- 
tions being works of unusual value.

viii PREFACE 
The book is a product of considerable experience in work- 
ing out conduct problems of a social character amongst 
those who are catalogued as normal. These problems have 
strikingly centered about the home life, and have illus- 
trated the principles of behavior emphasized by recent 
science. It has been impossible for the most part to make 
use of this material concretely because, even if names were 
withheld, the recording of these consultations would appear 
to the persons involved, a breaking of confidence. I here 
express my appreciation to these former students and 
friends of mine who have made it possible for me to get 
an insight into the social difficulties of wholesome, thought- 
ful people. I wish to thank Dr. Frankwood E. Williams 
for permission to use illustrative material from Mental 
Hygiene, and Dr. William A. White for the same permis- 
sion with reference to The Psychoanalytic Review. As in 
all my undertakings, I am especially indebted to my wife, 
Gladys H. Groves.

  CHAPTER I 
  Tue NEwW/UNDERSTANDING OF CONDUCT 
Bint began with man’s effort to understand¢and con- 
trol nature. In the modern era the advantages of the 
scientific method of dealing with the material world became 
obvious to all. Man’s physical security, comforts and 
pleasures increased as science advanced. The success of 
science in gratifying man’s material interests led naturally 
to the scientific study of man himself. Surely the happi- 
ness of man depends as much upon understanding and 
controlling human nature as upon the conquest of the 
physical world: The scientific method, so successful in the 
investigation of the world of matter, was takeh over into 
man’s own realm. Different aspects of human nature were 
studied in the spirit of science. In this way the various 
social sciences originated. Recent progress in these sciences 
has made possible a better knowledge of human action, a 
new understanding of conduet), em 
{int Tr an conduct is universal iness 
in life largely depends upon our having pleasant associa- 
tions with the peoplé about us.) The history of each day 
is for the most part the result of our many-cantacts with 
ee eet nowt tnd felaw-somkes ke therefore of the greatest importance to us personally that 
.we have pleasant associations with those in whose company 
jeo-dav- planes us and this requires of wai we soon learn 3 rience, that we try to understand our companions. 
. he teacher is particularly interested in human behavior, 
not merely because conduct is directly related to problems 
of school discipline, but because he needs a sound basis for

the teaching process itself. (The learning of the child is 
conditioned upon motives and habits and attitudes thai 
are understandable only when viewed as modes of behavior. 
The function of the school socially is to influence the con- 
duct of those who are soon to be citizens, responsible for 
public welfare. It is for this purpose of producing good 
citizenship that the schools are supported by public taxa- 
tion. , The efficiency of education is popularly and rightly 
estimated by its practical influence upon the everyday con- 
duct of those trained in our schools. 
This social function of our schools is beginning to receive 
the attention its importance justifies. Education as a per- 
sonal luxury or as a means of obtaining purely individual 
satisfaction is indefensible in a democratic society such as 
ours, and educators everywhere are estimating the success 
of our schools and colleges by their_ability to turn out 
graduates who perform public service. | If education means 
the development of conduct that is socially efficient and 
wholesome it behooves teachers to use to the utmost what- 
ever help there is available for those who try to understand 
conduct. 
——4When the child for the first time walks into the school- 
house he has already commenced his education. The child’s 
earliest experiences, built upon instincts, are even in the 
cradle given direction by the parents who desire to have 
him conform to the social situation of the adult, world. 
Thus our biological inheritance as soon as it begins its 
expression comes in contact with social compulsion. The 
child brings something into the world. The world presents 
something to the child. This social accumulation which the 
child finds about him is the product of human experiences, 
both good and bad, both useful and harmful., From the 
beginning of his career this mass of ideas and habits and 
values operating through parents and guardians influences

the child.|) Recent science shows us that these earliest con- 
tacts are'most important because of their persistent in- 
fluence upon personality. They give the foundation- 
support to the later character and in some cases at least 
persist in acting contrary to the conscious purposes of the 
matured individual. It is clear as a result of this recent 
knowledge concerning the importance of early childhood 
that much of the difficulty that the schools have in edu- , 
eating for social efficiency is due to these first experienoon 
Education, therefore, must include good preparation for 
parenthood. As so many thoughtful men and women real- 
ize, parents need all the help they can get from science, 
that they may meet successfully their obligations to their 
children. As the science of conduct develops, more 
emphasis will be placed on the work of parents. 
‘Tt is fortunate that parents everywhere are looking for 
help. They do not need persuasion. Those who attempt 
‘to maintain good homes usually appreciate their difficulties 
very keenly. They demand concrete, specific, clear assist- 
ance. It is just this that the new psychology and sociology 
are prepared to give, and are already giving. Preachment 
-© has given way to interpretation and instruction. Parents 
are given an adequate understanding of their part in the 
well-being of the child. [The first emphasis was naturally 
upon the physical health of the child. It led to movements 
such as that of baby hygiene, and the saying of babies 
from death, physical suffering and disease., Now parents - 
are seeking the same kind of practical help for the mental 
and social welfare of their children. ' The mental hygiene 
movement has been one of the good results of the recent 
progress in the sciences that minister to social welfare) No 
movement built upon applied science has ever had a more 
rapid development; no social welfare program has ever 
won the approval of serious-minded people more enthu-

siastically than has that represented in mental hygiene. ‘ 
There is great need of the practical assistance that. psy- 
chiatry, psychology and sociology are prepared to give. 
Thinking people are also conscious of this need and most 
eager to support any organized effort to conserve mental 
and social life by wise education. The mental hygiene 
program is built upon the idea that the directing influences 
that modify conduct, from their first expression in infancy, 
must be made as reasonable as possible and made to har- 
monize with the known facts of human behavior. 
Since the beginning of society people have been inter- 
ested just as we are in getting at the meaning of conduct. 
We, however, have in these days an advantage over our 
predecessors. We have science to help us, for at last 
science has seriously grappled with the mystery of human 
conduct and gradually it is accumulating knowledge that 
explains the causes that impel people to act as they do. 
It would be contrary to fact to assume that nothing has 
been known about human conduct until now. Shrewd 
observers always have been able to interpret human 
motives. Literature has gathered a great quantity of infor- 
mation regarding behavior. History itself has been almost 
entirely a record of conduct, although it has concerned 
itself too exclusively with the doings of officials, kings and 
the outstanding characters. 
In the past the difficulty that has made impossible a 
science of human behavior has been the lack of real knowl- 
edge regarding conduct. There has been enough recording 
of experience. Theories concerning behavior also we have 
had in great quantity. They have, however, represented 
for the most part mere opinion; and their subjective char- 
acter, due to their birth in the prejudices of the {one 
has made them worse than useless for the practical under- 
standing of the behavior of people. Philosophy, of course, 
 
-P-A-G-E-17
  NEW UNDERSTANDING OF CONDUCT 5 
has done its best to fill the scientifie void, but, having no 
. substantial foundation of factual knowledge, it has left the 
seeker for practical information regarding the why of con- 
duct disappointed in his quest. 
Phrenology, as it was known to our fathers, was a pre- 
mature attempt to build up a science of conduct withow 
an adequate colléction of facts. Franz Joseph Gall (1758- 
1828), its founder, a student of anatomy and physiology, 
early formulated the idea that only by an analysis of the 
behavior of the individual could there be any science o 
- conduct. Unfortunately his theories out-traveled the 
neurological knowledge of his day and he popularized the 
erroneous belief that the talents and dispositions of men 
were dependent upon the brain structure in a way tha 
made it possible for a skillful person to deduce a man’s 
abilities and characteristics by an examination of the 
external surface of the skull. This belief led to controversy 
and finally to a clearer understanding of the nature o: 
the brain. Thus, in stimulating a careful study of the 
brain, phrenology indirectly led to some important 
neurological discoveries. Gall also suggested that there 
was a correspondence between the instinctive life of the 
higher animals and some of the characteristic types o 
human behavior. The significance of this relationship was 
never appreciated until in our own time the behavioristic 
psychology from a study of animal behavior revealed tha 
Gall, had he but known it, might have staked out his 
claim to the discovery of what has proven to be a veritable 
mine of wealth for the psychologist. It was distinetly 
of advantage to those interested in the development of a 
science of conduct that the followers of phrenology had to 
be disproven, for in the process of establishing truth, 
important discoveries were made. It is unfortunate, how- 
ever, that phrenology still lingers and in,a modified form is

still taken seriously by some who are not familiar with 
the ‘teaching of psychological science. We still have some 
among us who attempt to interpret disposition and ability 
from head and body form, and occasionally even the hard- 
headed practical business man tries to make use of the 
system in choosing and discharging employees. 
Many people still cling to the bélief that there are other 
physical indications of disposition and capacity besides 
the surface of the skull. For example, there are those who, 
like Tristram Shandy’s father, think that the shape of the 
nose decides one’s destiny. How common is the belief, 
even though there are no facts to support it, that a square 
jaw indicates a pugnacious disposition. The opinion that 
a small chin demonstrates weakness of will is equally wide- 
spread and this mistaken judgment seriously handicaps the 
eareer of those who are so unfortunate as to be born with 
inconspicuous chins; and yet, in spite of this handicap, 
there is no evidence that they are actually less successful 
than their associates who are the proud possessors of mas- 
sive chins. These interpretations of physiognomy are 
entirely social in origin and have for their support mere 
prejudice and tradition. 
Palmistry is an interesting and curious illustration of 
an unscientific method of judging character. For perhaps 
five thousand years this purely superstitious interpreta- 
tion of the meaning of lines upon the palm of the hand 
has been used to estimate character and to foretell destiny. 
Both the hand and the skin have a meaning for the anato- 
mist and the physician and thus aid at times in the diag- 
nosis of conduct, when it is due to some pathological 
condition. There is no evidence whatever of any relation- 
ship between the lines on the hand and personal character- 
istics. This persistent interest in palmistry in spite of 
its lack of scientifig support bears testimony to the wide-

ce - NEW UNDERSTANDING OF CONDUCT @) 
spread and ancient desire of people to find some method 
of understanding individual behavior and to prophesy com- 
ing events. 
Of course it is true that we can often learn something 
of our associates’ social experience from such personal 
characteristics as the hands or clothes or movenients, as, 
for example, walking. The hands may indicate something 
regarding the general nature of the vocation. The clothes 
give us some clue to the personal habits and, we often 
assume, also to the financial situation. The movements 
often betray temperament and early behavior. If we 
checked up our judgments based upon these characteristics 
by the results of later experience we would have to admit, 
however, that these outward circumstances frequently 
deceive us regarding even the superficial facts concerning 
those whom we analyze. They are never safe guides with 
respect to the deeper levels of personality, and any attempt 
to make much of them will surely lead to costly mistakes 
of judgment. 
It has been the habit of people, even of savage people, 
to catalog human behavior under maxims, fables an 
proverbs. These general statements tell us much about 
principles and motives of behavior but they do not help 
us in understanding any individual problem of conduc 
They merely standardize similar activities in group con- 
cepts and when we apply them to a concrete situation we 
are as uncertain as ever whether a definite individual act 
belongs under one or another of the various principles. To 
discuss this it is necessary for us to analyze the individual 
himself and this we can do. with no greater ease because 
of the collection of maxims and proverbs. There is no 
royal road to character analysis. In any effort to under- 
stand people there is no escape from the slow, cautious 
and uncertain method of diagnosis. Conduct diagnosis

issues into an attempt to use such knowledge as we now 
have regarding behavior so as to get the clearest and most 
accurate idea possible of the social experience of the indi- 
vidual, and the greater our fund of scientific knowledge, 
the morg frequently our judgment of character will be 
correct, 
The task of collecting valuable information regarding 
human behavior has not belonged to any single science. 
Science as a whole has contributed to the increasing accum- 
ulation of knowledge. The largest contributions, how- 
ever, have come from biology, physiology, psycholog:; 
psychiatry and sociology. Material of great usefulness to 
those who seek to understand people has been gathered also 
by history, literature and especially by anthropology. 
Our present knowledge of behavior is therefore a result 
of a scientific pooling of facts. We could have made 
no progress at all in the undertaking without the codp- 
eration of workers in the various related fields of investi- 
gation. 
Biology has enormously contributed to our knowledge of 
human behavior. It has helped in many different ways, 
but perhaps it has helped most in the construction of a 
science of behavior by its insistence upon the right view- — 
point in regard to conduct. { Biologically we act to accom- 
plish adjustment to environment. A person’s behavior 
therefore is his effort to accomplish purposes. Good activity 
is tested by its efficiency. The social test of conduct is the 
same as that which zodlogical science has formulated and 
insisted upon. Are the acts of the person such as to 
produce favorable adjustment to the present, actual cir- 
cumstances? If so, the activities are socially efficient. If 
not, they are socially faulty and unsuccessful. Zodlogy has 
taught us to regard the entire personality, or organism in 
scientific terminology, including both mind and body, as
-P-A-G-E-21
NEW UNDERSTANDING OF CONDUCT 9) 
an adjusting mechanism. It is more complicated than the 
most remarkable machine. It has also what a machine 
eannot have—a flexibility that comes from consciousness. 
Its primary purpose, nevertheless, is the making of favor- 
able adjustments by acting upon the environment. This is 
as true of the mind as of the body. That the body acts as 
an adjusting mechanism is generally recognized. Biological 
science has forced us to see that mind also is an adjusting 
mechanism. Indeed the body adjustments themselves are 
essentially nervous in origin and are closely related to the 
mental life. From biology therefore we get the meaning 
and the test of conduct. Its meaning is adjustment. Its 
test is the efficiency of the adjustments made. 
Modern physiology has been and is of the greatest 
importance in the development of the science of behavior. 
New knowledge regarding the body has thrown unexpected 
light upon human personality, especially upon the emo- 
tions. A sound mind in a sound body has come to have 
a deeper and more exact meaning. The intimacy between 
body states and behavior is so great that no dividing line 
can be drawn between them in the analysis of definite 
conduct problems. The food we eat, the exercise we take 
or do not take, the sleep we have, these things do not 
register their effects merely upon the body. In influencing 
the body life these physical conditions also affect the mind 
and behavior. Recently physiology has discovered in the 
ductless glands of the body unexpected and tremendously 
important physical causes that operate upon both the physi- 
eal and the psychic states of the individual.” We are told 
for example that the influence of the increased or decreased 
secretions of the thyroid or adrenal bodies upon the indi- 
vidual may be great enough to prevent a brain structurally 
as good as Shakespeare’s from functioning beyond the effi- 
(1) May, J. V., Mental Diseases, Part 1, ch. 12. 
ai a i

ciency of a person with average mental equipment.” 
Experiments have demonstrated that the influence of 
adrenalin, the secretion of the adrenal glands, upon the 
blood has an extraordinary effect upon the emotions. These 
in turn have a compelling influence over conduct. 
All this knowledge obtained through recent study of 
the endocrine organs has made it still more evident that 
we cannot separate mind from body in the practical 
problems of conduct.| We are certainly only at the 
beginning of what promises to yield as important knowl- 
edge as science has ever gathered regarding the physical 
states and their relation to human behavior. The pres- 
ent emphasis upon this recent advance of physiological 
science must not hide the fact that in the largest sense 
it is the entire body with all its various organs that 
conditions behavior. Consciousness registers the general 
body situation and is sensitive to any kind of body dis- 
turbance or abnormality. Nothing so quickly changes 
tehavior as does physical disease. Illness forces us to 
recognize that the mechanism of behavior is built upon 
body tissues. 
To psychology and psychiatry, most of all the sciences, 
belongs credit for our present insight into. human behavior. 
Psychology, working along many lines, and psychiatry, 
necessarily engaged in attempts to solve all sorts of 
individual character problems, have accumulated the ma- 
terial of greatest value in the interpretation of human 
behavior. 
Both sciences have given themselves to the study of 
concrete material and increasingly have dealt with practical 
problems of personal adjustment. / In every field of human 
behavior, business, art, politics, teaching and the rest, the 
commanding importance of psychological and psychiatric

  yr: 
investigations is being recognized. Goods are bought and 
sold by psychological methods. A political campaign is 
now largely a psychological struggle between rival parties. 
Even war has become an enterprise that has to enlist the 
psychologists, The Great War not only made use of psy- 
chological principles; it was in large measure a psycho- 
logical contest. Morale,,a psychological product, came to 
be the deciding element in the contest. 
Indeed wherever the influence of modern thought per- 
meates, in every line of endeavor, there one finds the 
people concerned with practical responsibilities deeply 
interested in psychology. Never before have men busy 
with everyday affairs taken so great an interest in any 
science as that which they are now manifesting in psy- 
chology. (The popularity of the study is due’ to the value 
it has for those who deal with people. Recent psychology 
has been tested by experience, and the successful man of 
business and affairs is the most outspoken in his apprecia- 
tion of the advantage there is in having a scientific inter- 
pretation of mental behavior. 
Psychiatry started as the science of mental disorders. Its 
development has been rapid of late and it has already in 
this present century contributed a vast amount of infor- 
mation of great value regarding human conduct. This 
material which has resulted from the remarkable progress 
of the science has produced revolutionary changes in the 
interpretation and treatment of mental abnormalities. The /~ 
line of demarcation between normal and abnormal conduct 
which once was so clearly and rigidly drawn has faded. 
In practical experience it has been found difficult to under- 
stand mental disorders unless they are regarded as products 
of disease or the final expression of earlier hurtful experi- 
ences or habits or as the culmination of both the physical 
condition and the childhood experiences. 
 
-P-A-G-E-24
  12 PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL ADJUSTMENT 
Thus in actual practice mental abnormality has been 
found to be the natural outcome of behavior which in its 
beginning appeared perfectly normal although socially un- 
wise. The treatment and cure of mental disorders has 
also required the recognition of this causal relationship 
between earlier habits and later mental disturbances. The 
process of cure has largely consisted in a re-education of 
the patient, a reconstruction of the life in harmony with 
the principles of mental hygiene. 
In dealing with mental cases in this modern manner 
psychiatry necessarily gives more and more attention to the 
motives and conduct of children from the point of view 
of their influence upon adult behavior and happiness. This 
coneentration upon childhood as the original source of 
much of the mental suffering in later life has disclosed a 
great quantity of facts that concern conduct, facts hitherto 
unknown or neglected. The field of psychiatric service has 
been greatly extended. The outcropping of the emotional 
life has been found in most unexpected places. Criminal 
behavior, criminal cravings, incompatibilities between mem- 
bers of the same household, industrial unrest, inefficiency 
in business, unhappiness and a great many more forms of 
maladjustment to life have been found psychiatrie in 
origin. 
Sociology is the science that assumes the task of inter- 
preting group experiences. It is also the science that espe- 
cially attempts to further social progress. During the last 
decade sociology has turned its attention from its earlier 
theoretical discussions and seriously has undertaken the 
collection and explanation of evidence collected from all 
possible quarters that reveals the group behavior of human 
nature. Sociology has profited more than any other science 
by the wealth of material recently gathered in the allied 
fields of biology, physiology, psychology and psychiatry.
-P-A-G-E-25
NEW UNDERSTANDING OF CONDUCT 13 
It has in turn influenced other sciences by putting constant 
stress upon the advancement of human welfare as the only 
proper motive for scientific research. 
Sociology has found from experience that it can make no 
headway either as a science or as a division of social 
service unless it has a better understanding of human con- 
duet. Thus it has been forced to dig down into individual 
conduct in its search for explanation of the social experi- 
ences of men and women. In recent years it has drawn 
heavily upon psychology and psychiatry. Indeed all three 
sciences handle in large measure the very same material 
but with differing viewpoints and purposes. 
The codperative and supplementary relationship between 
sociology and psychology appears as soon as one attempts 
a diagnosis of behavior, whether the diagnosis proceeds 
from the social to the psychic, or from the psychic to the 
social. Whatever we wish to understand must be brought 
into contact with the rest of the individual’s life. This 
is constantly illustrated in school teaching. We cannot 
say, for example, because of our experience with two pupils 
in our class that William has a good memory and Frank 
a poor one. Investigation usually shows that each has a — 
good memory for things that he likes; each has a wretched 
memory for what he dislikes. Everyone is likely to have a 
vivid imagination for things that delight his soul; no imag- 
ination at all for the things that distress him, unless he 
is overcome by fears and obsessions. In the latter case 
his imagination, as a result of his pathological condition, 
may work just contrary to his natural inclination. We say 
that John Smith has good attention. Well, perhaps usually 
he has, but not always. Suppose we watch him. Do we 
not quickly discover that his attention is closely tied to his 
interests, that it is sensitive to his unpleasant reactions, 
that it is most concentrated with reference to his immediate 
   
-P-A-G-E-26
14 PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL ADJUSTMENT 
desires? The moment we drive his attention outside his 
circle of interests, even though the new interests are derived 
from more vigorous, personal wants, it begins to falter and 
prove uncertain. 
It is especially important that we keep in mind the 
importance of the child’s emotional life whenever we try to 
test his mentality. It is natural for us to attempt to find 
a measuring rod by which we can standardize human 
beings with the same exactness with which we measure 
eloth with a yardstick. Unfortunately for our under- 
taking, however, the nature of the material we are handling 
forbids the degree of certainty and exactness in psychic 
measurements that we easily obtain in dealing with mate- 
rial things. It is in the emotional life of the individual 
that we find the greatest obstacles to precision in tests of 
mentality. The recognition of this fact does not destroy 
the value of tests but it does disclose their limitation and 
difficulty. Every sort of test must be used reasonably 
to be used safely. In our zeal for standardization we must 
not discount the emotional reactions of the child tested. 
To conceive of the individual as static, to ignore the person- 
ality and the emotional attitudes that influence alertness, 
ends in classifications that are deceptive for the educator 
and unfair to the pupil. 
The disturbing influence of the emotions upon the meas- 
urement of intelligence was illustrated by Dr. 8S. P. Jar- 
rett and Dr. Phyllis Blanchard in a recent article.

depressive psychosis or dementia preecox, undecided. He was 
returned to the Tombs and sent to Matteawan. (Diagnosed as 
dementia precox at Matteawan, but subsequent history showed. 
that he was suffering from a manic-depressive attack.) 
Second admission, hospital number 42969, June 27,1919. Had 
been released from Matteawan on a writ of habeas corpus. At 
this time there was little to indicate a psychosis. Patient’s be- 
havior on the ward was normal; he helped with the work, ete. 
There were no gross defects of memory, orientation was good, 
no delusions or hallucinations, although there was not full insight 
into his previous attack. Patient was, however, codperative in 
every way. Stanford-Binet showed a mental age of 11-3, I. Q. 
70. The summary of the psychological examination read as fol- 
lows: ‘The evidence of mental tests is that this patient is on 
the border line of mental deficiency. He is of very inferior intel- 
ligence, yet he is of higher status than the inmates of institutions 
for the feeble-minded usually are. He might be described as 
semi-irresponsible, his mental level being between 11 and 12 years. 
.... Attitude docile and friendly throughout. No eccentricities 
of manner noted. Nothing bizarre in his responses.’ 
Third admission, hospital number 44143. Had been released 
from Matteawan on a writ of habeas corpus. His conduct was 
normal on the ward, ete., and he now had full insight into his 
previous illness. A second psychological examination showed a 
mental age of 16+, I. Q. 100+. At this time he was returned to 
court with the opinion that he had recovered from an attack of 
manic-depressive psychosis, and was liberated as not insane. 
The significance of this case lies in the fact that experi- 
enced medical men and trained psychological examiners 
recognized no affective reactions in the patient-of sufficient 
importance to suggest any doubt as to the accuracy of the 
results obtained upon the first psychological examination. 
There was only one slight difference in the clinical pictures 
at the time of the first and second examinations: at the time 
of the first test, the patient, although otherwise apparently 
normal in attitude, had not recovered full insight into his
-P-A-G-E-28
  16 PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL ADJUSTMENT 
condition, while at the time of the second test, he had com- 
plete insight into his previous illness. This case is not an 
isolated one in our experience. It is obvious therefore that 
the results of intelligence tests made after a psychotic 
attack can not be regarded as final until there is absolute 
certainty that the psychosis has completely cleared, and the 
intellectual faculties are freed for their full functioning. 
Not only is this true of such marked psychotic affections 
as that in the case reported above, but it also holds good in 
milder psychotic states, as the following cases demon- 
strate. ’’ 
As it is in the tests we give the child, so it is with every 
requirement we make of him. Educationally we must 
concern ourselves with the emotional attitudes of the child 
in their relation to school requirements as much as the 
school situation permits. Our ignoring of the emotional 
reactions of the child, at times due to the size of our classes, 
at times to our eagerness to accomplish the definite objec- 
tive demands placed upon us by ‘‘the system,’’ sometimes 
from lack of skill or concern, explains many of our failures 
in school instruction. Instruction to be thoroughly effective - 
must be winsome. It must recognize that the school teacher. 
has competition from other persons who also try to cap- 
tivate the child’s attention. We can no more ignore in 
our school practice the child’s emotional responses than 
industry can ignore those of the adult. If this makes teach- 
ing more difficult, it also makes it more fascinating. If it 
limits the teaching process, it also gives successful teaching 
all the more influence over the child, influence that is 
paramount because it is embedded in the instincts of the 
child himself.

NEW UNDERSTANDING OF CONDUCT Gp 
In the way that psychiatry has found it necessary to 
study the social history of the patient through what is 
known as its social service, so education, if it is to accom- 
plish what the public reasonably expects of it, must realize 
the importance of the social experience of the child. The 
child cannot be treated as a merely psychological product. 
The psychological tests by themselves frequently are not 
a solution but merely the statement of a problem. The 
physical condition may explain the poor work or the low 
rating. On the other hand the causes of the unsatisfactory 
progress of the child may be primarily or even entirely 
sociological. Home disturbances, intense emotional reac- 
tions of fear, shame or confusion, sex shock, feelings of 
personal grudge, and the like, affect profoundly the intel- 
lectual operations of every human being and especially of 
the child. Surely a condition that will impel a child into 
crime, as Dr. William Healy™ has demonstrated from his 
study of hundreds of cases, will more frequently in milder 
experiences draw the child’s attention away from school 
work. 
The teacher’s occupation will necessarily become more. 
and more concerned with social diagnosis. The aims of 
instruction will become increasingly social. The teacher 
can no longer, especially in the lower grades, be cael 
expert in the handling of subject-matter. The need of 
putting into use through the schools such science of con- 
duet as we now have will be stressed as the unfortunate 
effects of not doing this beéyme more apparent with the 
progress of mental hygiene. )The interest of the teacher 
in the science of conduct, alvéady great, is bound therefore 
to inerease. It will become an educational axiom that 
efficiency in instruction requires skill in the use of the

-P-A-G-E-30
  18 PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL ADJUSTMENT 
principles of conduct. As a result the profession of teach- 
ing will gain in public recognition, for it will become more 
generally appreciated that teaching is a complex process 
that requires for wholesome social results skill in individual 
diagnosis. A good teacher does not merely know things. 
He also knows people. It is imperative that he should 
know people since his task is socially the most important 
and his success depends upon his ability to deal wisely 
with human nature in the process of socialization.

CHAPTER II 
ImMpPvuLse AND SociaL ContTRoL 
If by human behavior is meant the attempt to adjust 
the life of an individual to his environmental conditions, 
the impulse must be thought of as the simplest and basic 
element in the process. Impulse is both an inherited 
mechanism which enables the individual to respond to a 
given stimulus in a definite, unlearned manner of behavior 
and also an impelling force that leads to the fixed response 
to the exciting stimulation. Thus impulse has two sides. 
It is activity. It is also desire. The impulse determines 
the manner of behavior. It also furnishes the impetus that 
leads us to attempt the adjustment of our life to our 
environment. Impulse with its dual character represents 
our inborn equipment for life and is of course fundamental 
in behavior. \ 
Our impulses which start and direct behavior constitute ) 
the most ancient function of our nervous system. The/ 
impetus to act is older and deeper than thinking. Think- 
ing came when the nervous mechanism had become very 
complex and the various forms of the instinctive drive 
required co-ordination. Thinking therefore originated as 
a means of making behavior more successful in its efforts 
at adjustment, and it is this fact which has led biology to 
regard thinking as a mode of behavior. 
‘he simplest type of response to environmental influence 
is the reflex. The reflex belongs to all life that has a 
nervous system and is of course usually advantageous to 
the reacting individual. The tendency of the eyelid to close 
whenever an object draws near the eye is a good example 
21
-P-A-G-E-34
  @) PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL ADJUSTMENT 
of a reflex, and also of the fact that the function of the 
reflex is generally useful to the organism. It is difficult 
to distinguish the reflex from the more complicated impulse 
which we call the instinct. The reflex is very simple as 
compared with the instinct, and much less flexible. The 
instinct may best be pictured as a chain of successive reflex 
acts. Instinctive acts are of a higher level than the reflex 
in the sense that they are nearer conscious purpose and © 
more amenable to control than the reflex. 
Any effort to understand the process of social control 
must start the analysis upon the lowest level of response, 
the reflex. 
The earliest form of social control appears in what is 
known as the conditioned reflex. Pavlov, a great Russian 
physiologist, studied the secretion of the salivary gland 
\_in the dog as affected by different stimuli. He found, for 
example, by feeding a dog meat and at the same time 
ringing a bell, that after a time the ringing of the bell 
alone would produce the same flow of saliva as that ordi- 
narily following the stimulus of the meat. The two stimuli 
had become so related together that the sound of the bell 
had the same influence upon the reflex mechanism as the 
physical presence of the meat. This kind of reaction is 
known as a conditioned reflex. The associated stimulus 
may, however, have an inhibitory relation to the stimulus 
with which it is brought into habitual association and in 
this way a process of control is originated. 
Examples of inhibitory reflexes are common in animal 
training. It is, for instance, no unusual thing to find a 
dog trained not to eat food when placed in certain cireum- 
stances. The well-trained dog, as some of us know from 
personal experience, can be taught to rest his nose beside 
food on the table and not touch it until it has been put 
down upon the floor. It is, however, with respect to the a
-P-A-G-E-35
  IMPULSE AND SOCIAL CONTROL 23 
child that we see the importance of inhibitory reflex con- 
trol. The training carried on by parents in the first years 
of childhood is largely an attempt to build up conditioned 
reflexes. 
The most important reflexes gather about the per- 
sonality of the mother, and a large part of the physical 
comfort of the child is associated with the mother’s atti- 
tude and activities to the extent of constructing a quantity 
of conditioned reflex experiences. The infant of a few 
weeks finds that the coming of his mother is followed by 
the satisfaction of his hunger. When a few months older 
he appreciates his mother’s putting him in bed when he 
is tired. Then the presence of the mother in itself satis- 
fies and rests the fretful or excited child. In such cases 
the mother becomes the exciting cause of the reflex 
mechanism and she is able to start or check lines of activi- 
ties that otherwise would be automatic reflexes. The child 
is given further conditioning of his reflex life by his play- 
mates in group games and social contact. The little 
swagger or babyish lisp that passes unnoticed or even draws 
forth affectionate comment within the family circle receives 
far different attention from a youngster’s slightly older 
playmates and neighbors. The derision he meets may make 
him reserve his swagger for use among his juniors, and 
attempt to conceal or master the lisp. This conditioning 
of reflexes by his playmates occurs early, long before the 
school period, and when the child begins his school career 
he has already a large number of conditioned reflexes. 
The school receives him, therefore, already modified in his 
reflex behavior, and to a degree at least brought under 
social coercion. 
School instruction is largely an effort to develop useful 
conditioned reflexes. In practical experience this means at 
times destroying reflexes already developed and construct-
-P-A-G-E-36
  24 PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL ADJUSTMENT 
ing other, more favorable responses. Inhibition from the 
beginning plays a considerable role in school training. 
Through his school experience the child is taught the 
advantage of acting in accord with school custom and in 
this way the foundation is laid for the coercion that civil- 
ization exercises on every ‘sane individual. 
As a process of inhibition and social control education 
necessarily assumes risks. The repression placed upon the 
child may become a burden and crush his emotional life. 
The child, especially if naturally timid, may react exces- 
sively to criticism until a systematic and persistent lack of 
confidence follows. In such circumstances the timidity 
and sensitiveness limit aggressive behavior and make it 
impossible for the child to disclose his full mental capacity. 
If this results in more school difficulty, the child suffers 
additional pain and greater lack of confidence. It often 
ends in such children growing up to be adults who go 
through life seriously handicapped by these experiences 
that have affected them after the manner of a simple con- 
ditioned reflex. What the psychiatrist means by re-educa- 
tion when he treats such eases of harmful repressions is 
getting the patient to go back through memory and rehearse 
his experiences and react to them in a wholesome and 
useful way. By this process the patient frequently develops 
unexpected power to cope with life and wins a happiness 
previously impossible. 
The educational process of inhibition and control shows 
itself more clearly with reference to the instinets, the more 
complex impulses. The definition and classification of the 
human instincts at present is a matter of great discussion 
in psychology. Three impulses are generally recognized as 
most primitive and dominant. These are known as the 
impulses of hunger, self-preservation, and sex. The first 
attempts a satisfy the physiological demands of the body 
7 ED "| . \
-P-A-G-E-37
  IMPULSE AND SOCIAL CONTROL 25 
for food; the second seeks the safety of the individual; and 
the third leads to the perpetuation of the race. Each of 
these instinctive drives feels the force of the group influ- 
ence and is both enlarged in meaning and curbed in expres- 
sion by the social forces that originate in human society. 
The hunger-drive passes far beyond a mere quest for food 
and in its present highly developed expression demands for 
its satisfaction the whole range of economie gratifications. 
The original biological hunger-food sequence under the 
stimulation. and discipline of the social group is turned 
into the more complicated hunger-work-money-food 
sequence. In actual experience the attention becomes more 
and more fixed upon the work and the money elements in 
the chain; and other desires than those of food occupy con- 
sciousness and produce the pain-pleasure experiences that 
in infantile and in simple primitive life belong primarily 
with the food interests. The entire producing and dis- 
tributing activities of our present highly organized eco- 
nomic world are engaged in providing satisfaction of the 
social enlargement of the hunger instinct, and represent the 
results of the socializing of the instinct. 
The self-preserving instinct is a group term that includes 
several different responses that minister to the protection 
of the individual. As in the case of the hunger-impulse, 
| the self-preserving instinct is also magnified and controlled 
by social influences. We who live in modern society are 
not ordinarily engaged in the effort to protect ourselves 
physically. Occasionally physical danger in one form or 
another demands and receives our attention. Usually, on 
the other hand, we are concerned with the preservation of 
our psychic interests. We protect our esteem, for example, 
with a degree of the emotional concern that primitive 
man felt for his physical safety. In this enlarged. and 
transformed sense, self-preservation operates constantly 
   
-P-A-G-E-38
  26 PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL ADJUSTMENT 
and with great force in modern life. If the social situation 
denies satisfaction to the instinct of self-preservation in 
its various forms there follows great restlessness and unhap- 
piness. If this condition becomes habitual the person 
begins to feel that he has lost part of his power, his per- 
sonality, and a chronic feeling of inferiority arises. This 
is what is meant by ‘‘inferiority complex.’’ By repeated 
defeats in his*desire for achievement the individual has 
been forced to recognize and react against his sense of 
weakness and impotence. 
Here for example is a student who in his class recita- 
tion has the bad habit of letting his voice fade away at 
the end of every sentence so that a large part of what 
he tries to say is unintelligible. The instructor tries to 
help the student overcome an unfortunate practice and 
soon discovers that the student himself realizes his diffi- 
culty but has no hope of doing differently. He says that 
people told him in his early life that he had a physical 
defect of speech so that he could not expect to speak 
properly. Later when he went to several doctors in town 
for help he was told by each of them that there was 
nothing at all the matter physically with his vocal organs. 
Nevertheless the statement of the physicians could not get 
out of his mind his earlier belief, and in speaking he 
quickly became conscious of his undertaking and faltered. 
He had chosen to become a lawyer. His vocational ambi- 
tion was in part at least the desire to succeed in a profession 
‘that necessarily would require him to learn to speak. His 
idea of his handicap in speaking ability influenced not 
only his choice of life work but also his class behavior. He 
was very harsh and critical and pugnacious in his attitude 
toward the class work of his college mates; thus seeking 
by his manner to turn attention from himself and to com- 
pensate for his inner feeling of weakness and inadequacy.
-P-A-G-E-39
  - IMPULSE AND SOCIAL CONTROL (2) 
In speaking he began his sentences with a half-successful 
overcoming of his inferiority and ended by surrendering 
to his self-depreciation. This speaking-habit was charac- 
teristic of his general behavior. His aggression was 
strongly expressed, but quickly given up when his attitude 
met with a counter-attack. His criticisms were exaggerated 
and unfair, but followed by silence when called into ques- 
tion. He rapidly improved both in speaking and in dispo- 
sition when the origin of his predicament and its sig- 
ificance were explained to him in detail. 
Social _contact_stimulates ambition_through competition ; 
it also checks one’s achievement. We try to excel because 
of our desire to win recognition. We fail to obtain sati 
faction because of the recognition others obtain. Self- 
steem thus becomes a social struggle. In this way the 
various forms of the self-preserving or self-asserting instinct 
are forced to assume sociological characteristics and are 
taken out of the purely physical realm. In the social group 
it is constantly for the advantage of some to encourage 
the desire for self-esteem on the part of others. It is 
equally against the self-esteem of others to see their rivals 
win success. Into this arena of opposing forces or motives 
every social enterprise, such as business, art, polities, edueca- 
tion, enters and attempts to use for its own interest the 
human driving power represented by the sociologically 
developed self-preserving instinct. 
The third great instinct, that of sex, receives the same 
social treatment as the rest. It also is stimulated by mod- 
ern social life and is equally checked and modified. The 
socializing of this instinct is largely responsible for the high 
level which civilization has attained. The sex element in 
modern life is wonderfully complex as compared with the 
pure reproductive impulse of animal life and is, by its 
refinement, far removed from its origin. The sex impulse 
    any
-P-A-G-E-40
  28 PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL ADJUSTMENT | 
becomes love. It flowers into the love of husband and wife 
and also of parent and child. It feeds adventure. It 
gives vitality to art in many forms. It proves an advantage 
to commerce because of its close relationship with fashion. 
It leads to competition and emulation and thus unites its 
strength with the second instinct. It provides a basis for 
family life. It stretches altruism until the latter is forced 
outside the family group and the parents’ attitude is 
expressed with reference to other people’s children. In 
this way sex is humanized beyond recognition by the influ- 
ence of tradition and social behavior. Thus also it adds the 
strength of its impulse to the processes that lift man to the 
human level. 
It is to be expected that difficulties will arise in the 
socializing of the three major instincts. Especially should 
we look for problems with reference to the sex instinct, 
since from its nature it needs the socializing influence of 
the group most and at the same time it cannot receive the 
same conscious attention in educational efforts that is 
given the other chief instincts. 
The facts of social life illustrate the difficulties that result 
from inadequate or harmful social influence operating upon 
sex impulses. A great part of the suffering and failures 
of life is due to unsocial behavior rooted in an imperfect 
socializing of the sex impulse. The true cause of some 
unsocial act or personal affliction may be the lack of a 
wholesome sex impulse although on the surface it may 
appear to come from some source which is in fact of 
secondary importance. In such cases social diagnosis fre- 
quently brings to light the real state of affairs and makes 
clear the type of educational problem with which we deal. 
It is the necessity of socializing the sex impulse, that 
social life may function on the high human level, and the 
difficulty of accomplishing the task of socialization that
-P-A-G-E-41
  
IMPULSE AND SOCIAL CONTROL eB 
explain why the psychiatrist and the sociologist so fre- 
quently find a sex element in a concrete behavior problem. 
The meaning of this will surely be misunderstood if one 
thinks of the matter as having to do with sex in the narrow 
physical sense. It is the psychic and social by-products 
of sex, the social creations that replace physical sex inter- 
ests, that especially vex us in our group life. Society has 
been able to refine and transform the sex impulse as neither 
of the other major impulses has been refined and trans- 
formed, but naturally in the process of doing this it has 
made possible a larger number of social disasters due to 
faulty socialization. S 
Although hunger, self-preservation, and the reproductive 
| impulse (including the sex and the parental instinct) are 
the basic drives that influence man socially, there is at 
present great difference of opinion among the authorities 
. regarding the number of the instincts, some defining many 
“and some few. The problem is complicated by both the 
difficulty of interpreting the child’s early behavior and 
also by the task of separating the purely instinctive act 
from the activity which is acquired through experience 
even though built upon an instinctive tendency. The 
sociological value of the impulsive and habitual activities 
has been used in the past to group behavior tendencies 
under a common term such as fear or curiosity. ( Instinct 
as used by the sociologist therefore has tended to become 
a name for habitual behavior characteristic of man in his 
social relations», Such terms have denoted the instinctive 
basis of behavior having definite social purposes. 
Of late the psychologists have insisted upon a more 
exact use of the term instinct. Instinct has from their 
viewpoint consisted of a specific, inherited mode of activity. 
The more general behavior has been treated as a habit 
pattern. However, there has been no disposition to regard 
 
-P-A-G-E-42
/ | 
&® 
  80) PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL ADJUSTMENT 
these activities classified under the latter term as less 
significant for social experience. The discussion is with 
reference to the origin of the activity rather than its force- 
fulness. The human instincts most frequently defined are 
hunger, sex, self-preservation (self abasement and self- 
assertion), pugnacity, fear (flight), gregariousness, curi- 
osity, workmanship, and acquisitiveness. 
“~The social life of human beings is built upon impulses. 
But, as we have seen in the case of the three most important 
instincts, this social life is not the simple, automatic, 
unmodified expression of the underlying inherited tenden- 
cies. If the basic impulses were permitted to dominat 
behavior without any guidance or training or restriction, 
organized society such as we now have would be impossible 
» The impulses provide momentum but they require coy- 
trol and direction. They furnish the raw material whith 
through the socializing process of the group is worked into 
the behavior which is characteristic of men and women. 
The socializing of natural impulses is especially the task 
of education. Instruction begun by the parent and con- 
tinued by the teacher has for its essential purpose the 
bringing of the impulsive life of the individual under the 
authority of the group. Of course neither parent nor school 
has a monopoly of this undertaking. In all his associations 
the individual feels the pressure of the group coming from 
every quarter upon his inherited tendencies; and he is 
forced to recognize social authority since the group will 
tolerate his presence upon no other condition. 
The individual has no choice in the matter. He cannot 
freely follow his original cravings, for they early bring 
him into conflict with the practices of the group and he 
learns from such experiences that his best interests, his 
personal satisfactions, are dependent upon his becoming 
acceptable to the people with whom he has contact. There-
-P-A-G-E-43
IMPULSE AND SOCIAL CONTROL 31 
fore the instincts of man do not serve him as animal 
instinets minister to the needs of the lower animals. The 
animal expresses his behavior upon the purely instinctive 
level and lives or dies according to whether his instinctive 
acts prove under the circumstances favorable or unfavor- 
able. Man must bring his impulses largely in line with 
group policy and these group standards to which he must 
conform are derived from the experiences of the group 
and not from the unrestrained impulses of the individual. 
There can be no escape from the influence of the group, 
for the individual’s own impulses drive him toward social 
relationships, and thus operate upon him as soon as he 
enters upon any association and demand from him acts 
that are supposed to be socially expedient. If the adjust- - 
ment results,in conflict within the individual there can 
be no solution in giving the impulses free rein, for such 
a program will result in increasing the opposition from 
the group and finally crushing the individual unless the 
pains inflicted upon him teach him to mend his ways. 
The education or socializing of the impulses is not an 
arbitrary interference with the purposes of the individual, 
on the part of the group, but a necessity. Human instincts 
do not furnish preparation for life. They merely give the 
substance for character-building. (Preparation for life is 
for the human being a social process and involves a trans- 
formation of instinctive tendencies. \ Conduct is lifted from 
the level of impulses to the level of social behavior. Edu- 
cation is therefore the means by which the group main- 
tains itself, the process by which the individual is given 
his equipment for membership in the group. The impul- 
sive energy is drawn up to the social level and expended 
in socialized behavior. 
The tendencies to activity that arise from man’s impulses 
are multitudinous and confusing. They are called forth 
 
-P-A-G-E-44
  32 PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL ADJUSTMENT 
by an environment that stimulates them in profusion. 
They are not adjusted to one another. The expression of 
one is frequently the denial of another. Sometimes they 
are mutually exclusive, just as for example the emotions 
of fear and of rage cannot at the same moment dominate 
any one’s consciousness. Individual happiness, therefore, 
requires that the various, conflicting impulses be brought 
from time to time into some degree of order. This demands 
the subordination of some and the checking and suppres- 
sion of others. The relationship of the impulses clamoring 
for recognition and expression is constantly undergoing 
change. Dominance is forever shifting and first one im- 
pulse and then another occupies the center of consciousness. 
There is still another reason why the impulsive life has 
to be constantly adjusted by social influences. The me- 
chanisms we inherit and in large measure the earlier 
habits that we acquire are not adapted to the needs of 
our present level of civilized behavior. The complex adult 
society of today is a development that has passed far 
beyond the simple character of primitive and savage life, 
and proportionally puts upon us demands that are in 
advance of our elementary animal and prehistoric instinc- 
tive reactions. To the socializing forces falls the duty of 
bringing the expression of man’s impulsive life up to the 
requirements of our modern social situation. 
The life into which the child with his uncultivated im- 
pulses enters is not a static, completed social situation but 
one that still changes and advances toward greater com- 
plexity. The group experiences therefore for which the 
child needs preparation are different even from those of 
the adult society which is undertaking the training. The 
child is taught in harmony with the adult standards of 
his day. His own mature behavior, however, must be car- 
ried on amid circumstances very unlike those of his child-

  IMPULSE AND SOCIAL CONTROL ( 33) 
hood. , The teacher, working under the conditions of today, 
seeks to equip the child for the obligations he must meet 
tomorrow. Under the influence of the limitations of his 
age he attempts to produce impulse-adjustment that will 
be in harmony with a social environment that is at the time 
largely: future. In the circumstances it is not strange 
that education often lags behind the demands put upon it 
by a rapidly developing social life. 
In order that the schools can minister in the largest) 
degree possible to a progressively developing civilization, \ 
they must attempt the difficult task of anticipating the 
future demands that society will make of their graduates. 
Unless the school forecasts the requirements that the group A 
behavior of tomorrow will place upon man’s impulsive 
nature, social loss and retardation must follow. The group 
cannot escape the test of flexibility and alertness that 
the environment insists upon in the ease of the individual 
if he seeks the advantages of a favorable adjustment to 
his surroundings. The group may postpone the penalty 
that must finally result from backward methods of social 
~adjustment. It may largely conceal from itself the origin 
of difficulties that result in archaic educational practices 
and obsolete educational material, but this will not in the 
slightest measure remove the social maladjustments that 
will vex men and women in their social relationships. Edu- 
cation, to be of social service, has to discipline and develop 
the impulses of the child in such a way as to make the 
inherited tendencies conform to the more wholesome, the 
more complex society that rightfully belongs to the next 
generation.

CHAPTER III 
Tue INstTINcTs AND THE COMPLEX 
One of the difficult problems upon which the science of 
psychology is at present working is the classification of 
the human instincts. Although at present there is con- 
siderable difference of opinion among psychologists as to 
this classification, there is rather general agreement that 
the socially dominant instincts are the instinct of self- 
assertion, the herd instinct, and the sex instinct. These 
instincts are universally found in normal human nature 
and also appear the basis of many of the other so-called 
instincts. The self-assertive includes several different 
forms of self-regarding impulsive reactions, notably in 
modern behavior, the socialized hunger urge. It leads to 
activities that protect the existence of the individual. The 
second, the gregarious instinct, emphasizes the social rela- 
tionships of the individual and has much to do with the 
bringing about of organized social life. The third, the sex 
instinet, perpetuates the race and also makes possible altru- 
istie interests that could not arise, were the individual 
under the dominance of the egoistic instinct alone. The 
social conduct of men and women is necessarily influenced 
more by these three fundamental pattern reactions than by 
any of the others. A large part of the problems of human 
behavior is concerned with the adjustment and harmonizing 
of these three basic instincts. 
It is natural that these fundamental reactions should 
often be in collision. Man’s environment is so complex 
and the stimulations that operate upon him, so many and 
so various that we find the three chief instincts brought 
36
-P-A-G-E-49
  
THE INSTINCTS AND THE COMPLEX 37 
into discord. This is the origin of most of the conflicts 
that have such a controlling influence over behavior. As 
a result of inheritance and early experience the instincts 
of self-assertion, of the herd, and of sex are expressed in 
differing intensity in different individuals. Each of the 
instincts also is excited to greater degrees of strength 
according to the particular circumstances of the envi- 
ronmental situation present at the time when the indi- 
vidual expresses his reaction. Frequently one instinct 
obstructs the expression of another. The opportunities for 
conflict between the self-assertive tendency and the herd- 
regarding attitude are particularly numerous. As one 
instinct meets obstructions it throws its momentum back 
upon the mind itself, and an adjustment of the individual’s 
self-expression follows the checking process. All sorts of 
relationships become possible, due to the limiting and con- 
flicting influences of the primary instincts upon one 
another. 
Each individual is always attempting to bring about a 
satisfactory adjustment of the three major interests. Such 
a harmonizing of the different instinctive cravings is not 
only difficult but is necessarily temporary. The mere ex- 
pression of one instinctive reaction brings forward a con- 
flicting desire and thus the adjustment is broken down and 
the process has to be gone through with again. Moreover, all 
the changing influences of body, mind and social experience 
operate upon the individual, perhaps checking one of the 
three instincts, while at the same time stimulating to the 
utmost the other two. Every possible combination of 
instinctive reaction is characteristic of normal human 
experience. As a result the individual is largely in per- 
sistent struggle for inner harmony, and the inner self 
may even at times be tumultuous because of the intensity 
of the conflicting interests.
-P-A-G-E-50
f\ (88) PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL ADJUSTMENT 
~ Definite, habitual reactions based upon one of the pri- 
)mary instincts may become established in the mind and 
*Yhave for the individual a very great emotional content. 
\ This is what is meant by the complez. Cthe complex, in 
its widest sense, is a connection of ideas, due to previous 
experience, which has for the individual a large emotional 
value.) Emotions connected with the complex are usually 
beyond what the experience justifies. Indeed, emotionally 
the complex may be contrary to the facts. Modern psy- 
chology uses the term complex with much the same mean- 
ing that Professor William James gave to the ‘‘self’’ when 
he pictured the individual as made up of different selves, 
each sympathetic toward experiences in harmony with its 
emotional character and hostile to new experience in dis- 
cord with its feeling tone. In other words, the self so long 
as it occupied consciousness would attempt to perpetuate 
itself and to discount the meaning of experience destruc- 
tive to its own dominance. The more modern term, ‘‘com- 
plex,’’ makes the situation much clearer. It also calls 
attention to the process of development. i 
As Professor Tansley has pointed out, a complex may 
be of two kinds, the universal or the particular. The uni- 
versal is characteristic of human nature in general and 
is a product of one of the three dominating instincts. The 
particular complex is generally weaker and more loosely 
constructed. It represents the special experiences of a 
definite individual. The particular complexes are the crea- 
“tions of training and education and therefore have an 
accidental character as compared with the fundamental 
basic type. Although the particular complexes are impor- 
tant, they are nevertheless secondary as compared with 
the others since they are lacking in the quality of uni- 
versality. The meaning of complex can best be brought 
out by illustration.
-P-A-G-E-51
THE INSTINCTS AND THE COMPLEX 39 
Suppose a conscientious boy finds himself, as a result 
of suggestion and opportunity, guilty of theft. He con- 
eeals his behavior and the thought of what he has done 
becomes a nucleus for various experiences of fear, desire 
of confession, suspicion that he is discovered, efforts at 
emotional compensation, and other allied reactions. The 
more he thinks about his bad behavior, the more signifi- 
cant it becomes. Perhaps he finds himself occupied with 
thoughts of his theft constantly during the waking day, 
especially when his mind wanders from any engrossing 
activity. A complex has formed itself, which in this 
ease is distinctly hostile to the inner poise and pleas- 
urable tone of the individual. Under such circumstances 
the boy can react to his complex in one of three 
ways. He may try to forget what he has done and thus 
push the experience as far as possible outside of con- 
sciousness. In this way he drives it into what is known 
as the subconscious. Even when it does not appear clearly 
any more in conscious experience we are sure that it has 
not departed from his life since it is almost certain to show 
itself in the dream experience. This attempt to be rid of 
he disagreeable association of ideas by forcing it out of 
consciousness is known_as repression, p On the other hand, 
the boy may adjust himself to his behavior by trying to 
rid himself of a sense of blame. In this case he struggles 
for harmony by loss of moral scruples. Effort is made 
to adjust the entire personality to the guilty experience 
and make that cheracteristic of his personality. A third 
reaction and perhaps the most harmful possible is to 
take refuge in phantasy. If this is done, the boy will 
try to convince himself that the theft was never com- 
mitted and that therefore he has nothing to blame him- 
self for and is in no risk of detection. If this policy 
is assumed, he will have to color the actual facts of 
 
-P-A-G-E-52
  (40) PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL ADJUSTMENT 
life more and more in order to make the unreal thing 
seem true. 
There are two exceedingly important complexes that are 
bound to form themselves in the life of the normal child. 
One is the father complex and the other, the mother com- 
plex. The experience of the child with either of his par- 
ents becomes the nucleus for a group of many different 
ideas and desires, all of them linked together by their 
relationship to the parent. For example, the boy will 
bring together a mass of feelings and ideas that originate _ 
in association with the mother, and this systematized 
accumulation of many different experiences will produce 
in his behavior reactions and emotions that are expressive 
of the complex itself. He will, for instance, imitate his 
mother and react with hostility to experiences out of har- 
mony with his mother-complex. He may develop jealousy 
with reference to the father, due to his desire to monopolize 
the mother. 
Another common form of complex with which everyone 
is familiar is the attitude of the person with one idea or 
with one book, or with very strong bias. This single inter- 
est brings into association a large number of different 
experiences because emotionally this person is always feed- 
ing his complex and is blind or hostile to- anything that 
would cause the undoing of the association of ideas which 
for him has come to have such importance. 
It is interesting to notice how the purpose of the moment 
tends to_bring forward certain complexes and to suppress 
others. For example, with the coming of the day the 
man of industry finds his imagination going forward to 
the tasks at hand, and the complexes related either appear 
in consciousness or are easily brought forward when the 
appropriate stimulus arrives. With the coming of evening 
and the possibilities of recreation, an entirely new set of
-P-A-G-E-53
  
THE INSTINCTS AND THE COMPLEX 41 
complexes take their place ready for emergence into con- 
sciousness. This has been beautifully expressed by Brown- 
ing in his contrasting poems, ‘‘Meeting at Night,’’ and 
‘Parting at Morning.’’ The first pictures a worker return- 
ing from the doings of the day, with the home complexes 
dominant; the second shows the same person looking for- 
ward to the work of the day. 
MEETING AT NIGHT 
The gray sea and the long black land 
And the yellow half-moon large and low; 
And the startled little waves that leap 
In fiery ringlets from their sleep, 
As I gain the cove with pushing prow, 
And quench its speed i’ the slushy sand. 
Then a mile of warm sea-scented beach; 
Three fields to cross till a farm appears; 
A tap at-the pane, the quick sharp scratch 
And blue spurt of a lighted match, 
And a voice less loud, through its joys and fears, 
Than the two hearts beating each to each. 
PARTING AT MORNING 
Round the cape of a sudden came the sea, 
And the sun looked over the mountain’s rim: 
And straight was a path of gold for him, 
, And the need of a world of men for me. 
Complexes that are stimulated but find no means of 
expression irritate very deeply. This is one of the fatiguing 
elements of modern life. All about us are stimulations, 
often purposely organized to stir up complexes of a definite 
sort with the expectation that the individual will respond 
with the desired conduct. The advertisement, however, 
that stimulates self-expression in one individual, according 
a ae  
-P-A-G-E-54
  2) PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL ADJUSTMENT 
to the will of the advertiser, is blocked by the financial 
circumstances of another individual so that the complex, 
although stimulated, can not pass to the appropriate ac- 
tivity. Under such circumstances the individual becomes 
restless and dissatisfied. Where the emotional strength of 
the complex is very great, its blocking brings a profound 
discontent and issues forth in a serious conflict. 
~<A large part of our thinking is occupied with efforts 
to defend complexes which we already Hee a process 
of protecting ourselves from the painful attempt at self- . 
serutiny is known as rationalization. The mind finds rea- 
sons for the dominance of the complex. We bring to bear 
all the resources of our experience to establish more firmly 
the associated ideas that are already over-valued and dis- 
torted. It is this habit of rationalization that makes self- 
correction so difficult and takes away from thought a large 
proportion of its possible value. Instead of using our 
thought to bring about the wisest possible adjustment, we 
expend it in the futile effort to make rational the attitude 
which by its very constituency is contrary to our welfare. 
Naturally the complexes form themselves particularly 
about the ego. We may bring under the ego-complex all 
the self-regarding instinctive reactions of the individual as 
Tansley has done in his ‘‘New Psychology and its Rela- 
tion to Life.’’ In that case all the instinctive reactions 
that are built upon self-assertion become different forms of 
the ego-complex. The following are the human instincts 
as classified by William MacDougall in his ‘‘Social Psy- 
chology’’: flight, pugnacity, repulsion, curiosity, self-asser- 
tion, self-abasement, parental instinct, reproduction (sex), 
feeding, gregariousness, acquisition, construction. It will 
be seen that several of these may be defined as secondary 
expressions of the primary self-assertive instinct, the basis 
of the ego-complex.
-P-A-G-E-55
THE INSTINCTS AND THE COMPLEX 43 
In this book self-assertion is used in the wide, catholic 
sense of the basic self-regarding instinct. Curiosity, £0 
instance, may be defined as one of the several expressions 
of self-assertion. The child begins his intellectual develop- 
ment by instinctive attitudes which express his interest in 
the surrounding environment, which we pronounce the evi- 
dences of curiosity. With eye and with touch he feeds 
his mind. Much of his i intellectual vitality in later life      
Xny obstruction of his desiré to” become acquainted” with 
things may decrease his later love of investigation and 
in that. way decrease his intellectual..ability....Heneeds 
direction. The child’s first attention to sex is likely to 
be entirely a matter of curiosity. Here is one of the 
cases where parents need to take great care lest an un- 
natural and morbid reaction follow from the effort of 
  the parent to suppress what is merely natural euriosity. | 
Curiosity attempts to project self-assertion by bringing | 
within comprehension unknown elements of the surround. | 
ing environment. 
The so-called instinct of workmanship also is related to 
self-assertion. It represents the individual’s effort to get 
satisfaction by creating projects which he himself works 
out. Since it represents a sense of power, it necessarily 
brings considerable satisfaction and a sense of esteem. 
This is particularly true when there is any element of 
social competition in the things produced. The teacher 
and parent must not forget that failure on the part of 
the young child to compete with his associates with a 
reasonable degree of success may lead to discouragement 
and loss of self-respect. 
It is particularly difficult for the city child to have 
enough opportunity for wholesome satisfaction along the 
lines of workmanship. The environment in which he finds 
 
-P-A-G-E-56
  G4\) PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL ADJUSTMENT 
himself is so largely standardized for adult enjoyment that 
his efforts at construction are necessarily few and fre- 
quently in conflict with the social order. This is particu- 
larly unfortunate since it weakens the child’s sense of 
the value of original creation and this in turn generally 
means a lack of understanding of the meaning of private 
property. Normally the child develops a sense of property- 
ownership by producing and using the things that are his. 
A city flat provides little opportunity for the child to 
make anything, and the city street limits the use of toys 
and other property dear to the heart of the child. As a 
result the city child is particularly impressed by oppor- 
tunities provided by communistic enterprises, and the sense 
of workmanship is decreased in proportion to his depend- 
ence upon community enterprises for his recreation. 
(~ Aequisition is often regarded as an instinct. It is 
) obvious that the desire to accumulate, which is so natural 
\ in early childhood and has such far-reaching consequences 
in our present highly organized society, is a derivative of 
the self-assertive instinct. The individual extends his per- 
sonality by ownership and control of the things that he 
acquires. This form of self-assertion has become one of 
the troublesome reactions in modern society. The desire 
of one individual to possess and control brings him in 
conflict with the desire of others. Society seems to be 
seeking a means of decreasing acquisitiveness without loss 
of personal initiative, which in times past has largely issued 
forth from acquisitive cravings. Acquisitiveness easily 
passes over into power cravings and a still stronger form 
of self-assertion results. 
When the complex becomes tremendously emotional and 
occupies a large part of the person’s life, disturbing the 
equilibrium of the individual in nearly all his doings, we 
have what we call a pathological complex. It is stronger | ,
-P-A-G-E-57
  THE INSTINCTS AND THE COMPLEX 45 
than the ordinary complex and also more deeply embedded 
in the subconscious. It has passed not only beyond the 
control of the individual but also beyond his knowledge. 
It is like a foreign element in his life. It intrudes itself 
into all his thinking and action and shows itself especially 
in experiences that portray the working of the subconscious, 
uch as dreams, neuroses and insanities. Some psychiatrists 
imit the use of the word complex entirely to these more 
violent experiences. The pathological complex in spite of 
its abnormality is usually formed in much the same way 
s the more ordinary complex. It represents the enormous 
evelopment of a systematic association of ideas of high 
motional content, which finally comes to have such im- 
ortance in the life of the person as to represent the same 
ind of situation that we find in the hysterical patient who 
evelops multiple personality. It is a sort of self within 
he self, showing its pernicious influence at every oppor- 
unity in conduct. 
In dealing with the complex it is important to keep in 
ind the significance of the unconscious life. In order 
o deal with the actual experiences of the human mind 
tt has been necessary to construct the hypothesis of(the 
neonscious. his provides an explanation for the appear- 
nee in consciousness of ideas and impulses that are not 
elated to the preceding experiences of consciousness and 
re not the product of outside stimulation. } This uncon- 
iousness is not subject to the direct coftrol of conscious- 
ess but its influence enters consciousness like an intruding 
mergy. The unconscious complex spreads along lines in 
armony with the characteristics of the individual uncon- 
jousness and as its effect from time to time appears in 
msciousness it may be out of harmony with the conscious 
ersonality. Thus the coming into consciousness of influ- 
ces of unconscious origin is at the least mysterious to 
   
-P-A-G-E-58
46 PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL ADJUSTMENT 
the person and sometimes actually oppressive(Tt has been 
found from experience that the emotional conflict due to 
these influences of unconscious origin can be happily dis- 
solved by the process of bringing into consciousness a clear 
understanding of how the difficulty has arisen. This 
_process)k ‘known as psycho- analysis) i is the product primarily 
of Dr. Sigmund Freud, of Vienna, Austria, who by attract- 
ing attention to the significance of the unconscious origin 
of emotional conflict has given the physician a new insight 
into mental disorders. Dr. Stanley Hall has perhaps best 
portrayed the importance of the unconscious by comparing 
the mind to an iceberg. The smaller part above the sur- 
face of the water represents consciousness ; the greater part, 
hidden, is the unconscious life. 
Although this unconscious life is differently interpreted 
at present by students of psychology, its significance for 
the social conflict is universally admitted. In actual prac- 
tice the psycho-analytic method requires great skill an 
can be used safely only by those who are thoroughly traine 
and experienced. The reason for this is in part the fae’ 
that just as soon as any effort is made to dig into th 
unconscious by extending processes of memory, resistance 
is developed by the person, since these experiences tha 
are concealed in the unconscious are largely the result: 
of having driven from conscious attention ideas or experi 
ences unpleasant to the person. Increasing resistance t 
the physician’s probing results from the psycho-analyti 
process. This, and also the possibility that the real diffi 
eulty is organic rather than mental, precludes the amatew: 
from using psycho-analysis in cases of mental difficult;

CHAPTER IV 
Hasir anp SociaL ConTINuITy 
Habit may be defined as a definite acquired mode of 
‘acting. It has a physiological basis, for the habit is made 
(possible by the correlation of brain cells and nerves. In 
the adult it is difficult to distinguish between habit and 
instinct. As a matter of fact much of what we call instinct / 
is actually habit. The habit is as immediate and as auto- 
matic as instinct; it is different in its complexity and 
also in the fact that it is constructed out of impulsive 
material and therefore can be built up or modified by 
conscious effort and practice. It is often forgotten that 
“habits contain both elements that we find in impulse: 
activity and feeling. In our common thought we call the 
       emotion in the sense of the feeling-response to the activity. 
Perhaps there can be no better illustration of the double 
aspect of habit than the two problems involved in the 
child’s first walking. The child’s attempt to walk is the 
greatest adventure that he has experienced up to that time. 
It is on the side of physical activity a task of adjustment 
of muscles and nerves so as to produce locomotion and 
balance. It is this part of the process that generally 
attracts the attention of older people. There is, however, 
an inner element in the adventure, a new zest, an eagerness 
to work out new powers faintly perceived. As the process 
develops, it contains the possibility of pain as well as 
pleasure. That is, the physical activity, the outward 
expression, is responded to in terms of inner attitude, the 
feeling experience. The walking for example may be 
49 
 
-P-A-G-E-62
  (50 PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL ADJUSTMENT 
delayed by any fear which arises as a result of serious 
physical injury or'pain. If the experience develops this 
element of fear excessively, not only will the physical act 
of walking be delayed; but it seems reasonable to assume 
that the child will have already suffered to some degree 
a loss of self-confidence as a result of his first serious 
conflict with reality. 
~—John Dewey brings out this double element in habit by 
the illustration of the artist.” The habits acquired by the 
artist make possible skill of manipulation. Without deli- 
eacy of touch, codrdination of muscles, he cannot paint. 
The artistic element itself, however, is contained in the 
emotional elements that go on with the mechanical process 
of painting. The artist’s habits, therefore, are primarily 
adaptations to this inner world of artistic creation. The 
expression of skill which uses form and color to satisfy 
inner fancies is secondary. He who has only the second 
may indeed paint but no one thinks of him as an artist. 
He who has only the first may appreciate art but he cannot 
oduce it. 
“It is this double element, feeling and activity, that 
e ins the ambivalency of habit. The individual is 
frequently torn between acting as judgment tells him the 
environment demands and in a different way as his inner 
self craves. Emotion draws him one way and former 
experience and usual custom and social expectation lead 
him in the opposite direction. This double-faced character 
of habit explains the frequent experience we all have of 
being very restless in our decisions, the fact being that our 
activity when carried forth stimulates emotional attitudes 
adverse to our decision. We have desired to carry forth 
two opposing courses of action and whichever one is

HABIT AND SOCIAL CONTINUITY 51 
finally chosen can hardly be carried to its culmination 
without stirring up regret and disappointment. 
iets is possible even for us to acquire strong habits as a 
result of discipline and training to which we react unfavor- 
ably. A strange result follows. We do with skill what we 
dislike to do. Anyone familiar with the results that follow 
the making of military drill a requirement in college will 
recall the many cases where the increasing skill of the 
student in carrying out the drill movements has accom- 
panied an equal dislike for the thing itself. The same 
fact is frequently illustrated in machine labor. The oper- 
ator who at the time of starting his new occupation found 
the manipulation of his machine faintly interesting, 
although he may have been performing the operation 
awkwardly, soon loses interest as the habit becomes physi- 
cally more accurate and automatic and the task itself there- 
fore less and less agreeable. In our school work this 
double aspect of habit shows itself particularly in the day- 
dreaming tendencies of children. As a process becomes 
echanically more perfect and the attention of the child 
is not so much needed for the carrying out of the instruc- 
or’s requirements, opportunity is given for indulgence in 
imagery that does hold the attention of the child. Since 
he habit process has little emotional zest the child falls 
ack on his inner states of mind and although he per- 
orms more easily the mechanical operations, their value 
o him psychically is tremendously decreased. His real 
ental life is wasted as it flows along the line of inner 
motional habits that have no relation at all with the 
echanical processes going on at the same time. 
Since the activity has been reduced to habit it can be 
arried on without the attention of the mind. Opportunity 
s thus given for the more interesting experiences of day- 
reaming to take possession of consciousness. Fancy is per- 5 
 
-P-A-G-E-64
y m : | 
52 PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL ADJUSTMENT 
mitted to express itself in pleasurable imagery along lines 
followed previously by similar reveries and thus an inner 
habit, saturated with emotional coloring, is constructed, 
which is utterly unrelated and indifferent to the other 
habitual activities going on at the same time. The mind 
in this manner becomes occupied with habits composed of 
pleasant fictions that give the person satisfaction without 
the substance of fact, but in no way assist him in his 
outward adjustments. One habit deals with reality, with 
the physical enterprise; the other removes interest from 
the environment and shuts the person up within himself. 
The mind is engaged in two different and mentally com- 
peting processes. Thus a division is created similar to the 
more serious separation of mental processes to which science 
gives the name dissociation. 
It is this tendency toward dissociation which makes the 
day-dreaming of the child dangerous to his success and 
distinguishes day-dreaming from faney and artistic crea- 
tion. The teacher has need of ever keeping in mind that 
good habit formation requires more than mere repetition 
leading to mechanical skill. It is necessary also to create 
in the child favorable attitudes toward the habit formation 
itself. The value of the habit needs to be stressed. It 
should be constantly related to ideas that are close to the 
desire of the child. In this way the habit develops equally 
in outward expression and inward attraction. The child 
likes what he does and works all the more skillfully because 
he works happily. By this process of preparing for habit 
formation by favorable mental attitudes time is saved 
and the child is taught to find his interest in his activity. 
A good deal of the laziness charged against school chil- 
dren is really due to the effort of the teacher to establish 
habits that the adult recognizes as desirable but that make 
no appeal to the children themselves. Since the child is
-P-A-G-E-65
  HABIT AND SOCIAL CONTINUITY 53. 
given little insight into the demands made upon him and 
since he lacks appreciation of their value, because of his 
immaturity, he naturally takes refuge in the world of 
faney. is lack of attention and concentration appears 
in his failure to accomplish his task; and, as a result, he 
is charged with having done his work unsatisfactorily. 
Little effort is likely to be made to interpret to him the 
meaning of the task put upon him. Indeed the assignment 
may be a time-killing exercise which really has for the 
child little lasting value !In any case the apparently lazy 
child is in need of analysis for he may be suffering from 
a chronic habit of day-dreaming which has largely replaced 
his ability to turn his entire mind to the task of actual 
accomplishment.) The importance of a division of attention 
on the part of the child in failures in school work is 
clearly brought out by the following quotation from a 
recent investigation of laziness in school children: 
‘“‘A failure to dwell in the real, though conventional, 
living world and a tendency to establish-a dream world 
for self-satisfaction may result in a mental preoccupation 
that precludes the direction of attention, save under the 
greatest urge, to the formalized work that has been estab- 
lished as of benefit to the community, but is not necessarily 
properly adapted to each and every individual. The 
phantasy may in itself be the cause of an inactivity that 
leads to the type of behavior so often resulting in the 
stigmatizing of children as dreamers, dawdlers, putterers, 
or slackers. Herein the emotional state merits more thor- 
ough investigation and sympathy rather than the driving, 
foreing, cajoling, or abusing that is utilized in an attempt 
to secure a desired effort. 
\ “Inactivity or sluggishness or laziness, even when it is 
accompanied by apparent good health, is not to be met by 
scolding, sarcasm, verbal abuse, or constant propulsion by 
 
-P-A-G-E-66
54 PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL ADJUSTMENT 
arguments as to the worth of industry; the driven child 
is more likely to be seized by a distaste for work than is 
the child whose inspired or spontaneous interests impel 
him to activity. \ The rational course is to offer an external 
stimulus that will tend to create an inner urge.) The per- 
sonal impetus, self-derived, arises from the stimulation of 
such primitive instincts as curiosity, pugnacity, and the 
like. There is little question but that the undue stress 
placed upon precepts as to the value of work is counter- 
acted by the obvious acclaim which the community so fre- 
quently yields to those who do the least physical labor. 
Children often are aware of this distinction and desire to 
ally themselves with the honored group, who labor least, 
rather than with the group whose apparently more arduous 
efforts are attended with comparatively less community 
recognition. 
“‘Normal children in abundant health and vigor possess 
tremendous reservoirs of energy for which they seek outlet. 
A damming back of activity in children of this type results 
in an unnatural sluggishness, inertness, or apathy that at 
once calls for medical investigations. Such sluggishness or 
apathy often represents the onset of some one of a number 
of contagious diseases whose first symptoms are expressed 
in altered behavior. The persistence, however, of these 
same symptoms too frequently results merely in an in- 
different and acquiescent recognition of their unfortunate 
character, and the term ‘laziness’ is accepted as an ade- | 
quate explanation of them. The use of this term under 
such circumstances is a verbal denomination of a condition 
that is not understood, and indicates merely a failure to 
comprehend the nature and trends of the child’s mind. 
“Certainly habitual apathy or constant indifference 
calls for investigation. One may say that the remedy lies 
in the establishment of habits of industry. This is of
-P-A-G-E-67
  HABIT AND SOCIAL CONTINUITY 55 
course true, but it is more difficult to achieve than it 
sounds. [It is too often forgotten that the energy outlet 
must be into channels that possess some real significance 
to and for the child! The conventional studies, manual 
work, or occupational direction that our schools provide, 
may be just as ineffective as the limited opportunities 
afforded in the home, in so far as any particular child 
is concerned. There has been too much domination by 
the adult point of view and a corresponding failure to 
interpret life’s activities in terms of children’s needs and 
natures. There is greater advantage in the doing of any- 
thing than in the doing of nothing. The habit of activity 
is paramount in the development of personality, and from 
the educational point of view the medium through which 
it is attained is relatively inconsequential. The superior 
assumptions of adults all too frequently run counter to the 
natural impulses of childhood. <A child’s education in 
activity is not to be regarded as purely disciplinary, a 
mere effort to keep him busy. His individuality merits 
recognition and his specific instinctive or acquired interests 
are not to be constantly thwarted, regarded as puerile, and, 
therefore, foolish or wholly undesirable and ineffective.’’™ 
The parent or teacher must not regard habit merely from 
the angle of individual efficiency. Habit is also a socializ- “ 
ing process and the stability of social life is built upon it. 
Professor William James has described habit as ‘‘the 
enormous fly-wheel of society, its most precious conserva- 
tive agent’? 
Social continuity is the product of social habits. Our 
institutions are primarily organized for the successful 
carrying out of habits that have become our custom as a

56 PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL ADJUSTMENT 
result of tradition and training. Habit is a sort of social 
cement, and if it were not for habit there could be nothing 
but anarchy in our political and social relations. Whatever 
becomes habitual seems necessary. Our familiarity with 
certain experiences tends to make them seem inevitable. 
It is this that creates the difficulty of correcting customs 
and ideas that are out of harmony with the actual con- 
ditions. Few there are that are able to step outside familiar 
conditions and impartially judge habits that have become 
to them as strong as their original nature. No one is so 
judicial as to be able to get outside of all the social habits 
round about him. Fortunately, however, it is possible to 
be critical regarding some of them. Reform originates 
from some critical and discerning person’s concentrating 
upon habitual social behavior that is clearly working 
against general welfare. By attracting attention to the 
fact that at a definite point social habit is working badly 
he eventually is able to get a majority to help him in the 
correction of the fault. Progress that comes about by this 
process is bound to be irksome to those individuals who 
are still thoroughly committed to the old habits and who 
because of age or emotional inflexibility are unable easily 
to make the new adjustment. They obstruct the changes, 
react violently to the restrictions that they feel are 
unjustly imposed upon them and in every way illustrate 
the force of social continuity through habits, and the diffi- 
eulty of switching from one course of social action to 
another. 
This is the seat of the failure of revolutions. The politi- 
eal upheaval may change all outward behavior and 
seemingly recreate the social world, as did the French 
Revolution. Nevertheless the habits of the people are 
little affected by these rapid, sweeping changes. The people 
still have the same emotional attitudes and crave, often
-P-A-G-E-69
  HABIT AND SOCIAL CONTINUITY 57 
without knowing it themselves, some of the former social 
conditions. The result is that the old life creeps back 
again, little by little replacing the changes inaugurated by 
the revolution. In the end, even though national and some- 
times political structure is different, the habit-life, which 
is the essential basis of the social tendencies, remains the 
same. 
This also explains the impossibility of inaugurating 
Utopias. The perfect state requires the perfect man, and 
the perfect man cannot be created by social conditions 
that belong to the actual human social life. The ideal 
state is impossible because it would require the complete 
revision of the habits of life of all the people. By the 
very process of attempting to put this into effect people 
would be so alienated that they could not endure the order 
of change. Social progress cannot come suddenly or com-“ 
pletely. It is a matter of habit construction. Advance 
in social behavior requires patience and is seldom a direct 
march forward. ‘ 
How then can progress come if habit is so hard to change, 
so tenacious in its effort to continue familiar conditions? 
We get our progress largely through pain. Unpleasant 
experiences, the result of social behavior, force attention 
upon the maladjustment. Pain is the critic of custom. 
When our habits are clearly not working for our advan- 
tage we begin to scrutinize them and some of us are 
bound to feel opposition to them. Progress thus comes ’ 
chiefly from the breaking down of methods of social adjust- 
ment that in a former period under different circumstances 
worked well. This crisis situation,” removes our behavior 
from the automatic, smooth habit-process and demands of 
us that we give our attention to the social maladjustment 
from which we suffer.

A very interesting and typical illustration of this experi- 
ence is the different attitudes taken commonly in regard 
to slavery by the people of the northern and southern 
states. In the north slavery was seen to be unprofitable 
sooner than this became evident in the south. The north 
at the beginning of the period of slavery had nearly as 
many slaves as the south. The economic life of the north- 
ern states required, however, free labor; and more and 
more it became clear that slavery. did not pay. As slaves 
decreased, the people, free from bias in regard to the 
matter, were in a position to start thinking about the 
morals involved. Some of the southerners were beginning 
to see that even in the plantation organization of agricul- 
ture, slavery was in the long run unprofitable. Before 
they were able to make any impression upon southern 
thinking the mass of the south reacted to the criticism of 
slavery by the reformers in the northern states in a way to 
make any peaceful settlement of the problem impossible. 
The difficulty with the pain method of correcting social 
habits is the fact that it is often exceedingly difficult to 
discover the real source of the pain. It is easier for one 
to know that he is suffering physical pain than it is some- 
times to find out whence the pain comes. The pain may 
express itself at one point; its origin may be elsewhere. 
What is true of the body and physical pain is even more 
true of social organization and social pain. Even if for 
a long period of time the south had actually suffered 
financial loss by holding to the archaic system of slave 
production it might have taken many years to convince 
the people of the true cause of their lack of prosperity. 
Over-production of cotton, inefficiency and deterioration 
of slave habits, low tariff, bad business methods and numer- 
ous explanations more agreeable than the true one would 
be likely to be chosen. In other words, habitual behavior
-P-A-G-E-71
HABIT AND SOCIAL CONTINUITY 59 
has a tendency to blind one to its own faults. Looking 
backward into any former state of society it is easy enough 
to see the situation as it really was because we are not tied 
by the social habits that were dominant at the time. 
Progress comes also from natural and accidental varia- 
tion. We do not exactly and completely copy the social 
habits round about us. The father teaches his son but the 
son differs a little from the father, in part because he 
fails somewhat in the process of duplication. We see this 
slight, gradual changing of social habits in savage society. 
At first it appears as if the people had no opportunity to 
vary at all. Their life is very simple and their social 
behavior rigid and strongly entrenched. But more detailed 
knowledge reveals that even in such a fixed social order 
changes gradually creep in. The child imitates but for- 
tunately not with complete success. His emotional reactions 
to his habits, because of the new circumstances of his life, 
may differ frona those of his father. Slight departure 
adds interest to his undertakings. The result is that he 
compromises. He does not much leave the old pathway. 
He does not, however, follow in the old ruts. This sliding 
in of social variation, this gradual change in the social 
behavior of a people, is indispensable to human progress. 
Education is unable in justice to its social mission to tie 
itself to the past and attempt merely to continue former 
customs and establish uniformity of social behavior over the 
longest possible stretch of time. It must prepare for the 
future also and train the child to meet conditions only 
on the horizon and not yet actual in social experience. 
Edueation cannot, however, discount the past without 
bringing about social loss, for it is from the culture of the 
past that insight may be had for the new experience. To 
wipe away all of the past is to attempt to destroy social 
habits that give substance to our present social life. Any 
 
-P-A-G-E-72
  (60° ) PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL ADJUSTMENT 
attempt to do this means working against the early 
impressions of childhood and is at violence with human 
nature. 
“r~Education conserves the past and prepares for the 
future. It especially adjusts life to the immediate situa- 
| tion with one eye on the experience of history and the 
\other on the prospects of the future. The good school 
system takes into account the fact that those who pass 
from its influence into life must use their resources under 
circumstances different from those under which the educa- 
tional program is constructed and managed. Education 
to be socially efficient can neither look backward and 
remove attention from the present, nor can it throw away 
the past and attempt to inaugurate social behavior at 
variance with the continuity that necessarily rests upon 
the handing on, from generation to generation, of social 
habits. A progressive educational program tries to help 
in the making of necessary social adjustments. When it 
fails, painful experience is the only remaining way of 
forming new adjustments of social habits. It is the proper 
business of education to reduce to a minimum these social 
experiences that announce through human suffering that 
the social habits of the group have gotten out of adjust- 
ment and do not satisfactorily minister to the common good. 
Social progress requires preparation through the proc- 
esses of instruction. To promote progress, the school 
has to train the young in a way that will. permit them, 
when they become adults, to develop more advantageous 
social behavior than that characteristic of their parents’ 
generation. 
The good teacher strives to give an education that will 
prepare for constant changes of social adjustment. He 
teaches in such a fashion as to stimulate the original ten- 
dencies of the child, and is not satisfied merely to obtain

education ever performs. It permits the trained person

CHAPTER V 
Emotionat Basis oF Socian CONFLICT 
The tremendous influence that emotion has upon human 
conduct is generally recognized. However much we pride 
ourselves upon will and however strongly we stress judg- 
ment in our analysis of our actions, our associates clearly 
see that we usually conform to our emotional life and 
act under its sway. Our activities are mostly to satisfy 
emotional demands. It is emotional pressure that stirs us 
to the actions that we explain or defend by the process 
of rationalization. Y 
By emotion is meant the feeling side of our impulsive—~/| 
tendencies, hereditary in origin, and closely related to body 
states, especially visceral and glandular. The emotion is 
leasant or unpleasant. It accompanies changes that take 
lace in the bod The emotional reaction that is con- 
ected with som specific experience also enters memory 
nd thus provision is made for the association of ideas 
ith emotional states. This association permits us to profit 
rom our emotional experience, since the emotional response 
ecompanying some definite behavior is remembered, and 
pon a second occasion when we are tempted to repeat 
he act the thought of our first reaction will either enforce 
ur desire to act or obstruct it. Emotion is the reacting 
ement in consciousness that is connected with impulses 
nd their modifications, habits. 
The emotional life of the little child is simple and spon- 
neous. His anger is instantly and freely expressed. His 
ars as well as his joys show themselves at once for there 
neither desire nor power on his part to withhold them. 
63 
   
-P-A-G-E-76
  64 PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL ADJUSTMENT 
Each emotion expresses itself freely with no inner effort 
of control and is followed by the succeeding emotion which 
spends itself without any inner protest on the part of the 
child. Hach impulse comes and goes without greatly modi- 
fying other succeeding impulses. Each merely claims the 
central place in consciousness for its brief period and then 
gives way to its successor. 
Parents, however, are by no means indifferent to 
these various emotional reactions and impulsive acts. 
They discriminate and try to teach the child to suppress, 
to control, to magnify this reaction, that impulsive act. 
Thus early the child’s impulsive behavior meets with 
criticism and approbation and a foundation is laid for 
an increasing control of his impulsive life as the child 
matures. 
The child’s period of unrestrained self-expression is brief 
indeed. He quickly finds it to his advantage to react 
or to seem to react as the adult world demands of him. 
This modification of his crude, unrestrained emotions as 
the result of adult interference is the beginning of the 
child’s social training. Now arises the possibility of emo- 
tional conflicts. For the first time the swelling emotion 
awakens the need of restraint as memory brings to con- 
sciousness the recollection of the after-effects of a similar 
emotional outburst in the past. The child begins to sense 
the fact that if he acts as he feels his expression will meet 
with disapprobation, perhaps with punishment. He holds 
back. He minimizes his feelings. He conceals them.\ He 
gets rid of them by the process of recollecting past experi- 
ence that smothers the developing emotion. In any case 
the emotion occasionally is checked by inner states of mind. 
Thus is inaugurated a new mode of behavior, a control of, 
emotional attitude. The child is now on the highway that 
leads to the well-disciplined, law-abiding adult character;
-P-A-G-E-77
  EMOTIONAL BASIS OF SOCIAL CONFLICT 65 
But there are before his advancing feet many pitfalls. 
He may suppress his emotions too deeply, never allowing ¥ 
the most boisterous any conscious outlet. He may permit 
the emotions to gather strength and merely keep them from 
outward normal expression. He may seek to stimulate 
the emotions and then conceal as far as possible their dis- 
charge, finding hidden and unsuspected methods of work- 
ing out his feelings. 
With so many possibilities of mishaps in the emotional 
realm it is natural enough that with the child’s first efforts 
at self-restraint should come also the risk of conflicts within 
the self. The adult’s mental and social conflicts, including 
those usually called moral, originate in emotional disturb- 
ances, which, traced to their first appearance, generally 
go back into childhood to some specific occurrence. As 
a result of unwise treatment or lack of insight the child 
met an emotional situation in an unfortunate manner, with 
results that linger on into the adult period. Such events 
are likely to add to their baneful influence by interfering 
from time to time with other experiences in such a way 
as to bring about an interlinked chain of conflicts, each 
related to the preceding, and eventually leading backward 
to the original conflict. - 
The most serious conflicts, those that deserve the designa- 
tion pathological, show themselves in neuroses. It is very 
important that parents and teachers realize that these 
extreme manifestations of emotional conflict are merely 
disorders of normal emotions. In the average child con- 
flicts arise in early childhood that may lead to serious 
meurotic conditions or badly adjusted conduct. It is cer- 
tain that the neurosis involves in its originating conflict 
o peculiar emotion or uncommon form of conflict. The 
distinetion between a minor conflict and one that leads 
0 a pathological mental catastrophe is primarily the re-

action of the child to the event provoking the conflict, 
and the influence upon him of his reaction. 
In our study of emotional conflicts and their influence 
upon personality we are necessarily forced to emphasize 
those of childhood since in this period alone do we see 
them in simple form and openly expressed. We seek to 
get the emotional elements in their most simple form 
and this means investigating them as they manifest them- 
selves in childhood. At this time we can most easily recog- 
nize the first effect of family interference and adult 
attempts to educate and mould the spontaneous emotional 
responses. 
~—ducation assumes the impressionableness of the 
child’s emotional nature. It is universally recognized that 
the child in his first few years is more sensitive to the 
influences that come upon him and particularly to those 
that have to do with his emotions. His first impressions 
are naturally the most impressive and long-lasting. It is 
this consequential character of early emotional experiences 
that makes the work of the parent and the teacher in the 
elementary schools so important. What happens to the 
child in the first coming-out of his emotional life is bound 
to have greater influence upon his adult behavior than 
will any ordinary experiences after his earliest years. To 
a larger degree than we have in the past realized, the 
child who enters school has already received emotional 
experiences that condition the work of the school and his 
later success in life. 
From a wide experience in diagnosing cases of juvenile 
delinquency Doctor William Healy” of the Judge Baker 
Foundation, Boston, has gathered a vast amount of case 
(1) Forsyth, D., The Rudiments of Character, The Psychoanalytic 
Review, Vol. 8, pp. 117-18, April, 1921. 
(2) Healy, W., Mental Conflict and Misconduct.
-P-A-G-E-79
EMOTIONAL BASIS OF SOCIAL CONFLICT 67 
material which demonstrates the decisive influence that 
mental conflict may have upon conduct. Dr. Healy de- 
» clares that the mental conflict is essentially emotional in 
character and comes about as a result of disturbances due 
to conflicting elements in the inner life of the child. These 
conflicts most easily originate in early childhood. They are 
frequently concealed from relatives and friends and may 
therefore be unsuspected by the child’s adult associates. 
They may result from a mental shock. They may occur 
as the product of outward experiences or they may issue , 
from the child’s inner thought. They may be repressed,“ 
as well as hidden and even driven from the child’s con- 
ciousness. By the process of repression the child does not 
however escape their influence. Indeed, it generally seems 
that the child suffers most from them when he reacts 
toward them with such intense fear that they are forced 
out of his ordinary thought and remain in him dissociated 
from the normal mental content. Repression may show 
itself either in results that appear in the organism of the 
child or which find expression in unwholesome conduct. 
These emotional disturbances often have to do with sex 
in one form or another but in Doctor Healy’s experience 
sex is not the only cause of difficulty. It is natural enough 
that sex should have a very large place in emotional dis- 
turbanees for sex necessarily receives more social repres- 
sion than do the other instincts. It has about it also a 
mystery that instils curiosity. Frequently it is first intro- 
duced into the life of the child by an older playmate in 
a way to make it seem morbid and different from all the 
other experiences of the child. Thus the subject of sex 
is made to stand by itself, and in the case of the young 
girl especially is reacted to by alternating attitudes of 
fascination, expressed in imagery and curiosity, and violent 
repression and hostility. If parents gave to the child any 
6
-P-A-G-E-80
  (68) PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL ADJUSTMENT 
es reasonable degree of help these dangerous disturban 
centering on sex would less often occur. But as a matter 
of fact the parent usually lacks either the capacity orf 
the insight to help the child through his difficulty. The 
wonder is therefore not that sex has so large a place in 
the emotional disturbances of childhood but rather that 
so many children pass through the danger without any 
evil consequences. 
———Dr. Healy has found the following to be the most pro- 
lifie causes of emotional disturbance. 
c~-({1) The child’s doubt regarding his own parentage. This 
uncertainty concerning parentage has for the child a much 
greater emotional content than the adult usually appre- 
ciates. Apparently parentage is a matter that to the child 
has supreme emotional significance. Any doubt regarding 
his parents, the discovery that those whom he has con- 
sidered his parents are not, leads to an emotional up- 
heaval and frequently to bad conduct. Jealousy that 
gathers about a step-parent also acts as does uncertainty 
regarding parentage. 
——(2) If the child finds out or suspects that those whom 
he has most trusted have deceived him and lied to him he 
is liable to an emotional conflict. 
£8) Sex as the disturbing cause. It is not the physical 
side of sex, the newly awakened instinct, but rather its 
mental elements, the mystery placed about it, the unnatural 
and excessive reactions of parents and teachers to harm- 
less questions and interest on the part of the child that 
causes the trouble. Often what is mostly curiosity concern- 
ing sex, and not sex in any proper sense, is treated by 
the adult as an evil in itself and by this reception it is 
naturally more impressed upon the child. With the atten- 
tion driven to the new and mysterious interest, the child 
has no outlet, no method of correlating this experience
-P-A-G-E-81
  EMOTIONAL BASIS OF SOCIAL CONFLICT i 69) 
with the rest of his life. In this fashion society brings 
into his life a discordant, even dissociated, element and 
treats all his efforts to recover his unity with suspicion. 
The consequence is, of course, an unnatural, unnecessary 
emotional reaction and conflict. 
We who have to do with children need to remember that 
the same civilization that attempts to repress the child’s 
curiosity concerning sex is also at work constantly, in 
myriad forms, stimulating this very same curiosity. This 
situation is one loaded with danger for the child. It is 
fortunate that wise parents are beginning to see clearly 
the peculiar position in which modern life places the boy 
and girl, and by assuming the full responsibility of parents 
are largely eliminating the dangerous emotional attitudes 
that children, unprotected and unassisted, easily form con- 
cerning sex. 
~—(4) Sensitive children may start an emotional conflict 
from harsh treatment or false accusation from those to 
whom they naturally look for affection and sympathy. 
Such experiences sometimes lead the child to view all 
people with suspicion and to hide his inner self forever 
after from his associates. An emotional upset of this 
kind may penetrate very deeply into the child’s inner life 
and poison the affections themselves. 
) Loneliness, homesickness, speech defects, deformities, 
unfortunate family reputation and such physical conditions 
as bladder defect may cause emotional disturbance. Doctor 
Healy considers this group especially dangerous since they 
frequently bring about positive anti-social and vindictive 
attitudes. 
Recently a successful business woman came for advice 
regarding the condition of her elder daughter. The girl, 
who was seventeen years of age, had within a year or two 
(1) Healy, W., Individual Delinquent, p. 357. Vv 
 
-P-A-G-E-82
70 PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL ADJUSTMENT 
become a great trial to the mother. Although previously 
a very good scholar at high school she lost all interest in 
her studies and finally refused to go to school. She also 
had been very fond of music, and for her age was a 
remarkably good pianist. But now she gave up her music 
lessons, and would not touch the piano. She took to being 
away from home a good deal, especially at night, and the 
mother was naturally very concerned. The mother was a 
hardworking and very efficient manager of a successful 
business. The husband had been dead some ten years. In 
the process of examination it was revealed that the girl 
had suffered some years from enuresis, which had been 
unsuccessfully treated by several doctors. At this point 
it seemed necessary, before going on with any sociological 
diagnosis, that the daughter’s physical difficulty receive 
expert medical attention. An appointment was made with 
a specialist. Meanwhile additional conversation with the 
mother revealed in her a critical attitude toward the child, 
which at least in part was due to a misunderstanding of 
the nature of the adolescent experience. It seemed nec- 
essary to discuss with the mother in some detail the mean- 
ing of adolescent conflict. The daughter’s physical diffi- 
culty was very quickly cured. To the surprise of the 
mother the girl’s behavior immediately changed and 
further consultation became unnecessary. The daughter 
eagerly went back to school and carried on her work with 
her former success, and at the end of the school year 
obtained a very good position as pianist for a fashionable 
summer camp. A year later she was still meeting life 
successfully. The information obtained regarding the case, 
and the immediate success following the treatment of the 
medical difficulty made it seem that this was a case of 
inferiority complex due to shame as a result of an infantile 
physical condition. The case was handled on that basis,
-P-A-G-E-83
  
EMOTIONAL BASIS OF SOCIAL CONFLICT Gi) 
and so far as known no other change occurred in the envi- 
ronment. The immediate improvement of condition indi- 
cated that the diagnosis was correct. Vv 
It is evident, as one would expect, that the home is the 
institution that can most often originate and best prevent 
emotional disturbance. In the home, life is familiar and 
intimate. Parents may do and say to the children what 
no one else would dare say or do. The child, especially 
when he is sensitive, is keenly susceptible to family situa- 
tions. His pride is easily hurt when the home appears 
inadequate or poverty-stricken or when either parent has 
a reputation of which he is ashamed. It follows there- 
fore that many of our childhood conflicts originate in 
unfortunate homes. Testimony to this fact is multiply- 
ing, gathered by all who have to do with pathological 
problems of conduct. The baneful influence of the un- 
wholesome home shows itself in juvenile delinquency 
and adult crime. It is also revealed in the history of 
patients who suffer from nervous breakdowns and mental 
maladies. 
Although childhood conflicts are primary and most 
serious, emotional disturbances are possible at any period 
in life. For some years the author has been called upon 
for help by college students who have been suffering from 
emotional upheavals. The period of time represented by 
these cases has been for the most part the last years of 
adolescence. Very serious cases have been directed to the 
psychiatrist and the full explanation of their difficulty is 
not known. Doubtless the psychiatrist has found most of 
these patients suffering emotionally from disturbances that 
started in the beginning of childhood. 
tudents who have been disturbed, but not to the degree 
of pathological disorder, have most commonly reacted to 
the following adolescent situations.

i | 42) PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL ADJUSTMENT | 
~(1) Unreasonable restriction. The adolescent seeks 
greater independence and greater freedom. This is one 
of the essential elements of adolescence and is instinctive 
in origin. Most homes provide this greater liberty either 
because of inability to curb the youth’s demand for more 
self-assertion or in the case of the better homes because 
of a recognition of the significance of the new demands of 
the youth. Some parents and guardians, however, instead 
of gradually freeing the youth and preparing him for self- 
responsibility, increase the control and undertake to deal 
with the situation as if it were a moral insurrection. Nat- 
urally the child rebels, at least inwardly, and at once com- 
mences a severe emotional struggle. Wise bringing up 
provides for this inevitable assumption of self-direction by 
the youth. In those cases in which the parents, one or 
both, war upon the youth’s new inclinations, the winning 
of freedom becomes for the adolescent an apparent repudia- 
tion.of the home. All the ties of affection protest against 
this. The instincts are insistent. It is no wonder that 
great emotional stress results. 
(2) Another cause of difficulty is shame, especially in 
regard to the parents or home. This has with the adolescent 
much the same results as with the child. It is likely to 
be less serious, for necessarily the meaning of the experi- 
ence is tempered by a larger outlook upon life. 
___8) Undisciplined impulses also cause a great deal of 
adolescent disturbance. Impulses have to be disciplined. 
How much, is the question. We can over-discipline them 
as well as under-discipline them. The only trustworth: 
discipline must come from within, the product of prope 
moral education. The parent and teacher need to remem- 
ber that the child often lacks judgment rather than a sense 
of responsibility. Judgment is largely a matter of experi- 
ence; responsibility is a virtue. Training in judgment is
-P-A-G-E-85
EMOTIONAL BASIS OF SOCIAL CONFLICT 73°) 
a larger service than the forcing of obedience. Parents 
who exercise strict control over the child but who have 
given no attention to the development of self-reliance may 
. find that the child escapes from them at adolescence and 
is altogether unfitted for self-responsibility because of the 
vast quantity of his undisciplined impulses. Then the youth 
begins to reap the results of his bad training and in the 
college period he begins to learn from bitter experience 
the need of self-control. 
“~~—€4) Vanity, pronounced sensitiveness by those in its grip, 
is another cause of emotional disturbance at college. The 
term vanity is used to cover a large number of different 
products of the instinct of self-assertion. Frequently these 
expressions of conceit or vanity are at heart reactions 
against ideas of inferiority. The difficulty comes when the 
individual, fattened with vanity, enters a group life such 
as that of college or business. He may have been protected 
previously from the inevitable social consequences of his 
attitude and now for the first time he experiences the 
hostility of a group determined to make him take his proper 
place. The only child and the spoiled child are particu- 
larly apt to get too good an opinion of themselves. When 
the youth feels the social attack and realizes that his claims 
are being stripped from him, he either aggressively strug- 
gles to win back his former pride or retreats within him- 
self and attempts to conceal how deeply he is hurt. This 
latter reaction is especially dangerous, since it may lead 
to bitterness and the withdrawal, if circumstances permit, 
from the contests of life. Those who have been put through 
the ordeal of giving up their self-conceit may believe 
themselves misunderstood or more frequently, when they 
are victims of bad training for life, may throw aside all 
sense of self-importance and become as timid as previously 
they were self-confident. 
 
-P-A-G-E-86
  (74) PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL ADJUSTMENT 
(5) Another common cause of emotional difficulty in the 
late adolescent period is due to changes in religious belief. 
Childhood faith, like other infantile experiences, normally 
has to change and mature. ‘‘When I became a man I put 
away childish things’’ writes Saint Paul, but many there 
are who have not in any orderly and natural way shared 
his experience. They cling to their childhood attitudes 
until they are shocked into letting go. This type of person 
is one who loses his religious confidence as a result of a 
more accurate knowledge of science. It must be confessed 
that not all teachers are constructive in their interpretation 
of science; some few positively enjoy upsetting a student’s 
confidence. In religion as in no other place, the proper 
home training assists the youth in passing through new 
experiences without risk. When the religious teaching has 
been rigid and morbid and hostile to science, then a basis 
is laid for an emotional upheaval when the young man 
or woman encounters new truth and has to deepen and 
reorganize the faith of his first years. 
_-—(6) Another very common cause of emotional conflict 
in the later portion of adolescence is the idea that one is 
unattractive. This is almost exclusively a young women’s 
problem. It has without question many different sources. 
It frequently comes when the girl has matured more 
rapidly than her associates. Since the girl usually in the 
high school period is more mature than her boy associates 
any additional maturing is a real handicap that may limit 
her contacts with the boys of her own age. If she finds 
herself unpopular or merely neglected socially she becomes 
doubtful of herself and inwardly loses social confidence. 
Then she becomes more and more aloof and less natural. 
These attitudes in turn operate upon her as additional 
handicaps and she becomes ‘‘ difficult to understand.’’ She 
misses many social invitations and may retreat from 
 
-P-A-G-E-87
  EMOTIONAL BASIS OF SOCIAL CONFLICT (5) 
social contacts and endeavor to satisfy herself with girl 
friends and books. She perhaps develops into an amateur 
scholar or ‘‘grind’’ as her mates are likely to say, and this 
increases still more her social difficulties. By the-time of 
high school graduation or when she is in college she may 
have constructed a program for life which assumes that she 
is lacking in attractiveness and can not expect to marry. 
Sooner or later her cravings for normal social contacts 
will break through her laboriously constructed life-policy 
and her deeper nature will protest against her predica- 
ment. Then is bound to come a tremendous emotional 
outburst. The same result follows occasionally if for the 
first time she discovers that she actually is becoming attrac- 
tive to some young man. Both parent and teacher can do 
a great deal to prevent this feeling of unattractiveness by 
elping the over-matured girl to understand her situation 
nd by guiding her and encouraging her in her efforts to 
in for herself a reasonable place in the social life of her 
roup. 
In an analysis of emotional conflict it is necessary to keep 
nm mind the difference between two opposite types of per- 
onality. They are known as the extrovertive and the in- 
rovertive personalities. Ahe extroverted person is inter- 
sted in the life about him and is particularly aggressive 
nd efficient in dealing with the concrete problems that 
resent themselves to him. He is little concerned about 
is inner life and avoids speculation since it is something 
lo foreign to his nature that he can not sympathize with 
in the slightest degree. The environment stimulates 
ction and he thoroughly occupies himself with enterprises 
all sorts. Thus the extrovert is known as the man of 
tion. 
The introvert is the opposite type of personality. He 
mostly interested in himself and to a large extent finds 
 
-P-A-G-E-88
> Ge PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL ADJUSTMENT 
dealing with the actual world difficult, in extreme cases 
even impossible. His general attitude toward reality is 
that of suspicion. From early childhood he has been a 
questioner and has wanted to understand the meaning of 
things. Even in childhood the questions he asks indicate 
a skeptical attitude toward the value of life itself. The 
introvertive person is interested in the interpretation of 
life rather than the mastery of it. Introversion represents 
a flight from reality into the inner life. The world of 
ideas occupies the interests of the person. The introvert 
finds it difficult to deal with the concrete problem because 
of his desire to interpret it and give it its meaning, and 
this means adjusting it to the system of ideas which have 
such a large place in consciousness. As a result philoso- 
phizing takes the place of action. The introvert often 
expresses what seem to be extréme égoistic attitudes. This 
frequently is reaction to a deep-seated sense of inadequacy 
which may have all the characteristics of the inferiority 
complex. 
Both types may develop their extreme characteristics 
to the point of abnormality. The extrovert may be so 
embedded in the environment as to be without stability of 
personality, and in certain mental disorders this condition| 
is found. On the other hand the introvert in insanity is 
a shut-in personality that has constructed an inner life o 
unreality as a result of completely divorcing the self fro 
actual conditions of life. 
Although both introversion and extroversion represen’ 
extremes in human reaction, every individual natural, 
tends toward the one or the other. It is the business 0: 
education to assist each type to develop its strength an 
avoid the weakness of excessive characteristic reaction| 
The introvert, for example, who discovers his natural ten 
dency and strengthens as far as possible his contact wit

the world becomes particularly efficient in dealing with 
certain aspects of life. The career of Darwin suggests an 
introverted personality and Kempf shows us how Darwin’s 
scientific attainments were stimulated by his personal expe- 
rience. There can not however be doubt that Darwin 
leveloped to a remarkable degree accurate observation 
which was the basis of his introvertive speculations. 
Napoleon, one of the most efficient personalities of history, 
has been grouped amongst the introverts. The present 
tendency in social life is to discount the value of the 
introvert and as a result there has developed rather wide- 
spread opinion that the introvert is necessarily pathologi- 
cal. This judgment is contrary to fact. The introvert 
when socialized contributes as usefully to social life as does 
the extrovert. In dealing with children it is a great ad- 
vantage to be able to tell in which group each individual 
elongs. This permits the teacher or parent to handle 
he child more skillfully and at the same time to point 
ut the weakness and the strength of the personality. 
A girl of six years spends much of her time in the réle 
f Queen Bess. She ignores intruders, calling her imag- 
ary associates by name and only with difficulty withdraw- 
g from her world of fancy to attend to the realities of 
e adult world which encompasses her. Tested by the 
erman revision of the Binet intelligence tests she receives 
mental rating of eight years, but can not do the four- 
ear tests in muscular coérdination, such as tying a shoe- 
ce in a bow knot. 
A four-year-old boy can not bear any kind of make- 
lieve story. Shown a beautiful picture, full of action, 
hich appeals to his mates, he asks how much the frame 
st, and how the corners were put together.

A three-year-old girl found her keenest delight in th 
doings of her ‘‘little dirls’’ whose every activity she dis 
cussed in detail with her parents and the elder sister, whos 
daily absence at school left her so much alone. In adul 
life she can recall the red brick house around the cornet 
where her imaginary babies lived, far more vividly thai 
the house in which she herself lived, and remembers th 
pride and affection she felt for her three little make-believ 
children as clearly as her feeling for her best-loved dollies 
It is easy to see that these three children would no 
need identical treatment on the part of parents an 
teachers. Often personalities of the two opposing types 
extrovert and introvert, are found in children of the sam 
family. The experience of the parents in dealing with thei 
first-born helps them little when the second child develop 
such widely differing traits. What one child likes best 
the other ignores; what is punishment for one is a soure 
of delight to the other. Isolation is to the introvertive chil: 
an opportunity to indulge in his phantasies; to the extro 
vertive child it may mean real suffering. Manual labo 
imposed on the introvert may be most irksome, espéciall: 
if it requires a concentration on the task itself that pr 
vents his linking it with his phantasies; the extrovert fin 
joy in activity, work as well as play. "i

CHAPTER VI 
THE Socrau SIeNIFICANCE or FEaR 
All observers of human conduct have appreciated the 
importance of the instinct of fear. In its most violent 
expressions of terror no instinct shows greater strength. 
The instinct particularly shows itself in animal life so 
that the very atmosphere of animal existence seems to 
be largely characterized by fear. In savage life, also, as 
travelers and investigators constantly remind us, fear 
occupies a tremendous place. There are numberless illus« 
rations of the power of fear to produce even death by 
rocesses that seem to be entirely psychic in origin. For 
xample, the savage has been known to eat the food which 
e happened to find in ‘the woods, but which later he dis- 
overed to be a portion of the meal of the king, and there- 
ore, like all things with which the king had contact, taboo. 
pon being informed of his accidental infringement of the 
ule of his tribe, the savage became so terror-stricken as 
0 die within a few hours. The same tremendous influence 
f fear shows itself occasionally in the life of the savage 
hild. Here is the case of a boy who was strong and 
ealthy until one day he became ill and explained that 
e had been eating some food forbidden to him on account 
f£ his age, and that he had been discovered and realized 
hat he could never grow up to be a man. He lay down, 
nder the conviction that death was imminent, and never 
ot up again, dying within three weeks. The operation 
£ taboo in primitive society constantly illustrates the tre- 
endous meaning of fear in the life of savages.

  82 PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL ADJUSTMENT 
The value of fear for the animal is not to be questioned 
The instinct leads him to act under most cera 
in the manner most favorable for his self-preservation. A: 
with animals, so with pre-historic man, there must hav 
been a considerable utility in the instinct of fear. Darl 
places, loud noises, unfamiliar circumstances, strange move 
ments, open spaces were often situations that indicatec 
danger, and it was of value to the primitive man to reac 
against such happenings, under the influence of the instine 
of fear. It is, however, a matter of discussion among psy 
chologists as to whether fear in modern civilized society; 
proves of advantage. As James has said, extreme fea 
often proves harmful and prevents one from escaping th 
impending danger. The tendency seems to be increasing]; 
to discount the value of fear as an emotion in presen 
social experience. (The most extreme 
are found in the realm of mental disease, and sugges 
that terror is, by its very nature, in a degree pathological 
James has said that civilized man in ordinary experience 
never realizes the full meaning of fear, often going fro: 
the cradle to the grave without any personal knowledg 
of the full strength of the emotion. 
ueKear, like rage, has very great influence upon the bod: 
state. Adrenalin is thrown into the blood during the exp 
rience of fear; the main stream of blood is sent from th 
abdominal viscera to the muscles and the central nervo 
system; sugar appears in the blood, being liberated fro 
the body reserve; and the fatigue of the muscles is retarde 
and reduced. These body-conditions in association wit| 
other minor ones serve to prepare the animal for his s 
preme exertion, whether he reacts to his danger by flig’ 
or by fighting. 
In studying the reactions of fear in infancy, Profess 
Watson has demonstrated that the instinctive respons
-P-A-G-E-95

of fear appear at birth. The infant feels fear, according 
to this authority, when support is withdrawn from him and 
the experimenter drops him so that he can be caught by 
an assistant. The infant also feels fear, says Watson, on 
hearing loud sounds, sometimes when given a slight push 
or shake when he is just falling asleep, and when, during 
the beginning of sleep, there is a sudden pulling of the 
lankets upon which he is lying. The responses under 
uch circumstances are a sudden catching of the breath, 
he effort to clutch at random with the hands, the closing 
f the eye-lids, the puckering up of the lips, and then 
rying. Older children attempt flight, and if possible hide. 
Students of savage society have given us classic deserip- 
tions of the expression of fear. The following quotation 
shows the state of fear which records itself upon bodily 
abits. In describing the Jakun or aboriginal Malayans, 
keat and Blagden write of their ‘‘never-ending struggle 
or existence first against the forees of nature, against 
unger, disease, and a hundred forms of death, and later 
gainst the persecutions of man, thus faithfully mirroring 
he battle of the gigantic vegetation and dangerous beasts 
mong which they lived. The shadow, the hall-mark of 
he primeval forest—at once their protector, their sustainer, 
nd their grave—is burned into them, and shows itself 
in the restless motion and hunted expression of their eyes, 
nd even in their very gait, for the great height to which 
hey raise the foot in walking (a habit acquired in cir- 
umventing the continual obstacles that meet them in the 
mdergrowth), and the careful deliberation with which 
hey plant it on the ground, remain even when they come 
ut into the open country, and expose them to much ridi- 
ule and cheap witticisms on the part of the Malays.’’™

In relating the initiation of the witch doctors of the 
natives of Southern Nigeria, Leonard illustrates the psychic 
influence of fear. ‘‘But there is another, the external and 
more tangible, side to it, which brings him into actual 
contact with the animal life of the forest, that, in com- 
bination with the fears which he himself has conjured up 
out of the hell of his imaginations, makes it all the more 
terrifying and terrible an ordeal. All the more so, because 
it seems to him.as the realization of his inmost thoughts, 
and all that has been told him; therefore proof positive 
and infallible that spirits in various forms and embodi- 
ments, vegetal and animal, have visited him. Bound hand 
and foot, morally as well as physically, he becomes a prey 
not only to his own hideous fears, but to the animal life 
which teems all round and frequently all over him,—the 
driver ants, active, combative, and always on the move, 
whom nothing short of fire and water can stop once they 
set themselves in motion, pouring like a black torrent, 
every single atom of which is instinct with fierce vitality, 
through and over every obstacle; the restless red-tree ants, 
that, although always busy in the construction of their 
leafy domiciles, have yet time enough left to sting; the 
large and loathsome stink ants, that fill the air with their 
offensive effluvia; the bush cats, leopards, iguanas, an 
snakes, always on the look-out for victims with which to 
appease their hungry appetites. That the experience 
which in this way befall him are often diabolical enoug 
to upset the nerves of the bravest and strongest man, ca’ 
well be imagined. So that when a novice emerges fro: 
the hellish ordeal with nerves shaken and courage intact. 
having undergone a probation so exacting, a process s 
hardening and sterilizing that it freezes up any of the mil 
of human kindness with which he may have been possesse 
into the cold hard ice of a deadly antipathy, he is wel

qualified to become a fiend incarnate, who gloats over and 
revels in the flesh and blood of his own kith and kin.’’™ 
In mental diseases we find experiences that resemble in 
considerable detail savage reactions to fear. Formerly 
much of the behavior of patients suffering from mental 
illness was either ignored or misunderstood. We now know 
that these activities that appear so meaningless are often- 
times rehearsals of experiences of tremendous importance 
in the early life of the individual, and are likely to be. 
related to earlier experiences of fear. A young woman 
suffering from psycho-neurosis was greatly helped by 
studying her strange ceremonial observances from the view- 
point of primitive society. She found herself repeating 
actions characteristic of primitive behavior. She also 
found that fear had much to do with her illness and was 
the force behind her strange conduct. In her own words, 
“Fear has been a predominant element in all my illness. 
Theoretically I would not have admitted that my God was 
pre-eminently a God to be feared and held in terror but 
all my practices were based upon that idea and I was ever 
afraid of offending and dishonoring Him; all my cere- 
monials partook of this fear and my whole life was per- 
vaded by a sense of texror.} Most distinct among my early 
experiences and impressions is this fear in the form of 
an ever present dread of death, which possessed me power- 
fully at the age of eight and thereafter, so that I was filled 
with dread anticipation as day drew to its close and lay 
awake in secret terror when night had actually come. This 
fear was with me all the years of my illness with also 
other manifestations of it, fear of injury in play, terror 
of rocks falling upon me, of being buried alive, of drown- 
ing, of any experience of being smothered, excessive fear 
(1) Leonard, A. G., The Lower Niger and Its Tribes, p. 498

  (86) PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL ADJUSTMENT 
of snakes, all of these closely connected with the fear of 
death and the hereafter. Some of the more childish forms 
were partially left behind, but it is helpful now to find 
that these fears all belong to the infant and primitive mind, 
and to see them embodied in the simple animistic forms 
of these childish races, stripped of some of the awful value 
with which my distorted ideas and ceremonials were en- 
veloping them.’ 
——The most common reaction to fear is running away. 
There are, however, other characteristic modes of behavior, 
such as the attempt to escape by hiding. This we find 
commonly in animal life and also, as everyone knows, in 
the behavior of children. Another reaction is similar to 
the second. It is the attempt of the animal to remain 
silent. This also is characteristic of human behavior, for 
frequently one of the first impulses of a person much 
afraid is to remain motionless and if possible to produce 
not the slightest sound. We find, both in animal and in 
man, a tendency when under the emotion of fear to cling, 
as the drowning man clings to anything within reach, or 
the child to its mother. Another variety of fear reaction 
is the shrinking or starting back. This one easily observes 
in the behavior of a horse frightened by the sudden appear- 
ing of a strange object. In the same way a human being 
shrinks from the edge of a high cliff or from some terrify- 
ing object. Some children react in this way to unfamiliar 
persons. Another animal reaction which has received con- 
siderable attention because of its clear advantage to the 
frightened animal is the paralysis which causes the animal 
to remain motionless. This is particularly likely to occur 
when there is no possibility of running away. We also 
have, especially in children, the ery of fear, the instinctive

THE SOCIAL SIGNIFICANCE OF FEAR \sD 
attempt to call for help or protection. Hudson reports a 
ease, when having driven away a weasel from her young, 
the baby weasels continued to cry out in shrill voices and 
move about in circles, making not the slightest attempt 
to escape or to conceal themselves after the manner of 
birds. 
“Fear in modern life tends to move away from the 
objective stimulating outside condition and more and more 
to have to do with the inward state of mind. In other 
words the emotional element comes to have a greater signifi- 
eance than the inciting instinct. As a result of this, fear 
as we find it in our present life has much to do with our 
ideas; and a large part of such fear as is commonly expe- 
rienced originates from the thoughts that appear in con- 
sciousness rather than from actual situations in the outer 
environment that need to be reacted to in such a way as 
to protect one from danger. This change of emphasis 
leads to the magnifying of the. social causes that bring 
about fear, and also of the social consequences of the fear 
produced. It is by changing fear from having to do with 
experiences that endanger the physical existence of the 
human being and tying them up with the dangers that 
threaten the happiness or prestige or relationships of mod- 
ern man that the decrease in intensity of the instinct 
has been brought about. 
Even in pathological expressions of fear we find behavior 
which shows the influence of modern social conditions. For 
example, patients suffering from fear of dirt are frequently 
comfortable so long as everything and everybody round 
about remains still. If any movement is made which stirs 
up dust, they immediately react with discomfort. They 
shake their clothing every few moments. Or perhaps they 
(2) Hudson, W. H., “The Naturalist in La Plata,” chap. 6, p. 104. 
 
-P-A-G-E-100
88 PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL ADJUSTMENT 
are afraid of making any contact lest they get dirt upon 
their hands. One such patient was terror-stricken unless 
he wore gloves. They have been known to react against 
this fear of dirt to such an extent as to wash fifty times 
or more a day, in some cases actually producing sores. 
They are often fully capable of realizing the irrationality 
of their behavior, but even though they are told repeatedly 
that they make themselves more liable to infection by their 
much washing, they continue nevertheless. 
We have milder expressions of the same abnormal fear 
on the part of persons who are frightened when they find 
themselves in a church or theater with a crowd of people, 
or crossing a bridge, or ‘passing through a tunnel, or even 
confined within an ordinary room or a railroad carriage. 
There are individuals who fear blushing when they meet 
strangers, and who naturally therefore do blush. 
The emotional quality of fear shows itself often, as com- 
mon thought recognizes, in the dream. The dream of 
terror, the nightmare, is a familiar experience to all. It 
is particularly found in children and there can not be 
doubt of the intensity of the emotion which is passing 
through the sleeping consciousness. Often when one has 
passed safely through a grave danger, the experience will 
be repeated in one form or another over a considerable 
period of time in the dreams. This has been a common 
occurrence in persons suffering from so-called shell shock 
in the late war. They have been known to rehearse in 
detail the experience of shock. Children very commonly 
jump up from bed and ery in terror. If one watches 
them he sees evidences of the profound disturbance which 
‘without doubt is often connected with organic conditions, 
although it expresses itself in psychic phenomena. It ‘has 
at times been found that the soldier who, exposed to danger, 
apparently has no consciousness of fear and therefore

behaves with the utmost self-control, thereafter suffers 
severely from expressions of fear in his dreams. The man: 
who faces physical danger in warfare and who suffers 
fear-may repress it and attempt from shame to drive it 
from his mind. He may find, however, that the repression 
is not permanently successful. The fear comes back and 
is a second time repressed. Soon he becomes anxious lest 
he express fear and suffers that most dangerous state of 
mind, fear of fear. In this state of strain and anxiety he 
is liable to suffer from nightmare, faulty digestion, fatigue, 
until some new and perhaps slight stimulation brings about 
a crisis and he becomes a sufferer from anxiety neurosis. 
He is no longer of value as a soldier. Whether his con- 
dition develops into a more dangerous nervous breakdown, 
or finally passes, depends both upon his original tempera- 
ment and the strength of the stress put upon him by his 
environment. 
We find fear arising from all sorts of causes in present 
social experience. Suggestion is one of the many ways 
in which fear is produced, and perhaps the most common 
orm of such suggestion is fear with reference to health. 
his has so much significance that it is recognized by all 
hysicians who understand human conduct, that real suffer- 
ng may originate from an accidental, thoughtless sugges- 
ion. The person who thinks himself suffering from heart 
isease because of the careless suggestion of his physician 
ay develop a good many symptoms of the malady and 
ave as much difficulty as a result of his unfounded fear 
s if he were actually suffering from disease. This power 
f suggestion may be seen in all sorts of ideas regarding 
ll health. It is particularly important that the child 
e protected from such suggestions and it is unfortunate 
hat doctors thoughtlessly make statements, overheard by 
hildren, which are taken to mean something different from 
      
   
    
      
        
-P-A-G-E-102
    90 PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL ADJUSTMENT 
what is really intended or which are naturally exaggerated 
by the child’s fear and lack of knowledge regarding the 
true state of affairs. It is certainly true that life-long 
hypochondria can originate in this fashion in the case 
of neurotic children. 
One of the prolific causes of mental complexes is sug- 
gestions of fear. For example, a five-year-old child who 
sleeps out of doors and had never before been afraid of 
lightning, hearing an older child talk about a house that 
had been previously struck by lightning, reacted with fear 
at the next occurrence of a thunder storm. She came in 
from the sleeping porch to the presence of the father and 
said she wanted to be with him. The father had himself 
in earlier life suffered from fear of lightning, due to sug- 
gestions from his mother who reacted tremendously to 
thunderstorms, showing abject terror in the presence of 
her children. Anxious to protect his child from a similar 
experience, he felt that perhaps the best he could do for 
the child was to allow her to have a feeling of security and 
the realization that so far as he was concerned, there was 
no cause for fear. The child was therefore invited to lie 
down upon the couch in her father’s study and was soon 
asleep. Some months after, when the next storm appeared 
the mother going out to see whether the child was again 
afraid found her standing on her bed looking out at the 
storm. She remarked, ‘‘Mama, I didn’t know there 
was blue around the edge of the lightning, just like the 
yellow around the candle.’? From that time on no evi 
dence of fear has ever appeared and now the child has 
the habit of putting on her bathing suit during thunder 
storms and going out in the rain and dancing on th 
lawn. Unquestionably, a complex. had started, but for 
tunately in the atmosphere of perfect assurance it dis 
appeared.

  THE SOCIAL SIGNIFICANCE OF FEAR 91 
More than half a century ago a housekeeper, in the 
absence of a five-year-old boy’s parents, sought to punish 
him effectually for a childish naughtiness of which she 
believed him guilty. She shut the little one up in a room 
at the top of the house, and told him he must live on 
bread and water until he confessed to having committed 
the misdemeanor of which she accused him. Unable to 
pretend a guilt that was not his, the little fellow lived 
alone in the third floor room for three days, when his 
parents unexpectedly returned home. A quarter of a cen- 
tury later the boy, now a happy father with two children 
.of his own, received a letter from the old housekeeper 
asking forgiveness for her eruel treatment of the little 
five-year-old, and saying she had long since had positive 
proof of the child’s innocence. In his sixtieth year the 
man had a serious illness during which he became delirious. 
He constantly implored his nurse to go with him up 
to the attic. Finally while she was out for exercise he 
persuaded his fifteen-year-old daughter to accompany 
him to the attic. Here he sat on a chest weeping, 
signed to the daughter to be perfectly quiet, and whis- 
pered, ‘‘They told me to come. They told me to come.’’ 
He stayed in the attic, listening for outside sounds, 
weeping and softly moaning, ‘‘They told me to come,’’ 
until the daughter prevailed on him to return to his bed 
lest the nurse find out that he had left it. During the 
rest of that day and on the next day the sick man 
tried unceasingly to get someone to go with him to the 
attic. He must go, he said, but he dared not go alone. 
While watching by his bedside during the night his eld- 
est son heard the father say, ‘‘They wouldn’t come near 
me. Nobody came. JI listened and listened. Three 
days and three nights. A little room. All alone. Nobody 
eame.”” 
 
-P-A-G-E-104
92 PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL ADJUSTMENT 
In lesser degree parents themselves have been known to 
punish or threaten to punish their little children in ways 
that are liable to be productive of lasting fear. The leav- 
ing of children alone in the house after dark, even though 
the children may be ten or twelve years old, seems to give 
rise to genuine emotions of fear which thereafter tend to 
accompany similar situations throughout adult life. This 
is especially striking in persons who feel not the slightest 
degree of fear in really dangerous positions, in an out-of- 
door environment. 
A very interesting case of a thoroughly established fear 
complex extending over a long period of time and making . 
great trouble has been given by Dr. Boris Sidis. A young 
Russian was troubled by periodic convulsions and paralysis 
of one part of the body. This condition had led to the 
diagnosis of epilepsy. Doctors Morton Prince and Boris 
Sidis, however, finally came to the conclusion that there 
was present no true organic disease. The first attack 
had appeared five years earlier when the patient was living 
in Russia. At that time he was sixteen years of age. 
After escorting a young lady home from a dance he re- 
turned to look for a ring which she had lost. It was 
after midnight and it was necessary for him in going back 
to pass by a cemetery. When passing the graveyard he 
thought he heard someone running after him. He turned 
to run, stumbled and lost consciousness. Upon coming to 
himself he found his arm, leg and head afflicted with an 
uncontrollable shaking. This continued for about a week, 
after which he appeared to be of normal health. From 
that time each year he had a similar attack. When hypno- 
tized he went through the experience which led to his diffi- 
culty. It was possible also to bring on the attacks by 
simply recalling to memory during hypnosis what had hap- 
pened to him before the first attack. The physicians
-P-A-G-E-105

lJecided that his trouble was due to vivid subconscious 
memories of his earlier fear; and through suggestion he 
vas brought back to normal conduct. 
Worry is a_mild form of fear characteristic of modern 
ife. It is, lik ar, often the result of suggestion and 
iso many times expresses complexes unknown to the suf- 
erer. It adds greatly to the strain of life. Good habits, 
specially during the formative period, can largely pre- 
vent it. One who has the habit of worrying is forever 
inding occasions for anxiety. Although again and again 
he worry is proved unnecessary and unreasonable, the 
1abit continues. It not only leads to great loss of energy 
ut also becomes a considerable burden for the relatives 
nd associates. It is much easier to prevent the establish- 
nent of this bad attitude toward life than it is to cure it 
nee it has become firmly fixed. A psycho-analytie under- 
tanding of the formation of the habit of worry frequently 
loes a great deal to decrease the tendency toward anxiety. 
Fear has a tendency to inhibit the operation of the 
ind. It fixes the attention and excludes other ideas. To 
me extent this appears in worry. One finds it impossible 
keep his mind upon his work because he constantly runs 
er in consciousness the thought of the feared events. In 
uch the same way that physical fear often paralyzes 
e subject, fear ideas limit the efficiency of the mind. It 
therefore most unfortunate in any undertaking to dwell 
on the risks involved, in the sense of reacting emotionally 
the situation. 
It must be pointed out that the parent is not denied 
e opportunity of teaching children to avoid danger 
cause of the risk of creating fear. Danger can be treated 
a purely intellectual matter. The harm comes when the 
ild is led to an emotional reaction; when, for instance, 
ess is put upon the risk by rehearsing in detail con-

sequences that through the imagination of the child brin 
about emotional reactions. Children need to be taught th 
facts that involve risk. Formerly, however, parents ofte 
have added to this purely objective statement of fact 
large quantity of emotion, believing that in that way tk 
teaching could be more effectually impressed upon the chili 
If a child is treated as a reasonable being from earl 
years there is no need of adding this emotional pre 
sure, and by the wiser statement the child is freed fro 
any likelihood of developing fear attitudes. It must ni 
be forgotten that fear sometimes, by holding the attentior 
becomes a fascinating suggestion and brings the child unde 
the domination of the very thing which he is trying 1 
avoid. 
Any sense of inferiority can operate upon the growin 
child to bring about reactions of fear. It is also true thé 
» by frightening the child a degree of inferiority can | 
produced. One of the consequences of the inferiority con 
plex is its perpetual stirring up of fear. This emotion: 
reaction may become so strong and so persistent as 1 
make it difficult for the sufferer to put his attention upo 
anything except his own sense of impotency. As a resu 
he becomes weak, not so much because of the origin 
difficulty, but because of the operation of the associat 
fear. It is very important, particularly in the schoolroo 
that no recourse, for purposes of discipline, be made 
the stirring up of the fear emotion. It is not possible f 
fear to be brought to a specific experience and held the: 
The risk is that it spread into other experiences, one fe| 
producing another until a whole series of fear reactio

result influence the life persistently. It is interesting

aside. If, however, the fleeing person becomes angry he 
is likely to stop and fight, and by that process loses his 
fear. Anger suggests self-assertion; fear, self-retreat. It 
is a common experience to find fear in circumstances of 
great danger absolutely disappearing with the development 
of stronger feelings of hostility. 
Fear also is connected frequently with sex. This comes 
about especially in the case of the woman who has been 
so badly prepared for life that her whole sex nature 
becomes a thing of mystery and of fear. Under such cir- 
umstanees it is not strange that occasionally when through 
arriage she enters in contact with sex as a reality that 
an not be repressed from experience, she finds herself in 
he clutches of fear. It is particularly unfortunate that 
uch occurrences should come about at the beginning of 
uch a relationship as marriage, for there is necessarily 
reat opportunity in the situation for a misunderstanding 
hat will hamper the development of good comradeship and 
nduring affection. As is shown in the chapter on sex, the 
raining of the home may be such as to make any morbid 
ssociation of fear and sex practically impossible. Without 
oubt the new attitude which treats the sex element of 
ife educationally in much the same way as any of the 
reat concerns of man’s social life will prove an enormously 
elpful thing in conserving marriage happiness and elim- 
mating fear from an artificial connection with the pro- 
ound instinct of sex. 
Fear, to some extent, shows itself differently in city 
md rural environment. Country people suffer from isola- 
ion; and there are timid people in that environment who 
ave impressive fear experiences, particularly at night. 
hildren especially are afraid as a result of having to 
avel lonely roads alone in the dark. They are often 
Id stories that make very deep impressions and stir up

enduring fear. No parent can be too careful to prevent 
' this from happening in the case of his own children, The 
teacher also should remember that by furnishing to his 
children abiding interests he can largely prevent in them, 
as they mature, the morbid tendency that telling weird 
stories to younger children represents, since that is often 
the result of lives barren of mental or emotional interests. 
In the urban environment fear gathers about contact 
with people. One often becomes afraid of crowds, of 
hold-ups, robberies and the like. The newspapers suggest 
_fear constantly by their rehearsal of sensational criminal 
activities. One who is alone in the city sometimes feels 
a sense of fear that amounts almost to terror. Country 
people unfamiliar with city life are more especially prone 
to this experience, although under certain cireumstances 
it comes to the most urban-minded. The sudden loss of 
funds or impending illness in a strange city before con- 
tacts have been established is usually able to rouse an 
enthralling wave of terror, which soon proves itself largely 
emotional in basis as it recedes before the sweeping back 
ef the person’s habitual poise. It not infrequently happens 
that a person who is not only city-bred but city-minded, 
widely traveled and of adventurous spirit, after a dozen 
years more or less of life spent unwillingly in the country| 
revisits his favorite metropolitan center for a protracted 
stay, only to find himself bewildered by the increased 
volume and changed methods of handling traffic, upset by| 
the tremendous change from his quiet life in the country, 
and altogether unnerved by the noise and hustle of th 
once-loved city. Instead of being able to enjoy the long- 
wished-for sojourn in the city, his new-found timidity may 
even drive the unwilling countryman back to his quie 
home after but a few days of city life instead of the week: 
or months he had planned.

THE SOCIAL SIGNIFICANCE OF FEAR a 
In industry we find a great deal of fear, especially 
amongst the working class the fear of losing one’s job, 
the fear of shut-downs, ete. Much of the trouble between 
eapital and labor is the result of fear. The capitalist 
fears the encroachment of labor and the laboring man is’ 
constantly anxious, lest the capitalist make it impossible 
for him.to earn a fair living. If the working man could 
be sure of his job, he would be much more content. The 
manufacturer, on the other hand, sometimes feels that by 
making employment insecure, the worker will be stimulated 
to greater production than otherwise would be possible. 
Perhaps fear can be so used as a stimulant, but all attempts 
to control human nature by fear lead to such negative 
self-feeling that restlessness is bound to follow and in the 
end the stimulant fails to be successful. Contented workers 
are better workers than men driven by fear. One of the 
tasks of modern industry is to remove from the worker 
the great amount of fear now experienced by him. In 
some way unemployment must be solved. In so far as 
capitalism creates fear, it is in the long run working against 
its own existence. 
Mankind has always made use of fear of infringement 
of law for purposes of social control. It is questionable 
to what extent this process of control is successful today. 
History demonstrates that by multiplying penalties and 
inflicting very severe punishment crime is not decreased. 
As social evolution progresses, less and less stress will be 
put upon fear even as a means of preventing crime. 
Running through history is evidence of the value human 
nature puts upon courage. In many respects it has been 
in the past the most honored of all social virtues. It may 
be that this represents relics of the period when physical 
warfare had such an overwhelming importance. As hand 
to hand combat decreases, and perhaps happily war itself
-P-A-G-E-110
98 PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL ADJUSTMENT 
as an experience of human association, physical courage 
is likely to be less and less emphasized. It certainly does 
not deserve the social attention it has received up to the 
present. Society prospers much more on moral courage. 
Greater suffering comes to the group at present from lack 
of courage in mental and moral attitudes than from defi- 
ciency in physical courage. It was interesting recently 
to hear Sir Basil Thomson, former director of Scotland 
Yard, declare that when the war broke out nearly all 
the desperate, habitual criminals of England, who were 
guilty of crime of a major sort, enlisted voluntarily and 
served with great courage through the war. He expressed 
the opinion that this was to be expected, since he had 
always felt that the burglar, for example, is naturally a 
man of courage. This is a striking evidence of the fact 
that physical courage may easily be anti-social and that 
wholesome society can not be satisfied merely with instilling 
in its citizens the need of courage. The bigger task is to 
turn courage into productive channels. 
Edueation increasingly places emphasis upon mental 
and moral courage. The influence of modern life in creat- 
ing attitudes that make exhibitions of physical courage 
more and more reluctant in the sensitive type of person 
showed itself very clearly in the late war. <A great deal 
of ‘‘shell shock,’’ so-called, was due to the struggle of 
highly civilized human beings trying to reduce themselves 
to a type of courage which had become for them exceed- 
ingly difficult. Such persons certainly were not necessarily 
cowards. In the moral and intellectual realm they may 
have been courageous to an extreme degree. 
Since man is naturally so conservative, so unwilling to 
face new circumstances, the kind of courage that needs 
especially to be emphasized by education is that of the 
intellectual and moral type. <A great deal of social retarda-
-P-A-G-E-111
THE SOCIAL SIGNIFICANCE OF FEAR 99 
tion is built upon this inherent tendency of man to let 
things be as they are rather than to think his way into 
more advantageous circumstances. The conservative per- 
son often fears thinking because it makes possible the 
danger of new adjustment. This comes out very clearly 
in the experience of the savage. <A typical illustration is 
given by Williamson. ‘‘One thing which impressed me in 
New Guinea, and especially near Port Moresby and in 
the Roro and Mekeo districts, where the people have been 
for so long in constant contact with white men, is the 
extreme conservatism of its inhabitants. In these districts 
more in touch with civilization, you find European axes 
and knives; the adzes are often fitted with plane-irons, 
instead of with cutting-stones. Various other white man’s 
productions have found their way into the villages, and 
some of the old superstitious practices and ceremonies have 
died away. But as regards dress, mode of life, clan and 
social systems, the construction of their houses and forms 
of their villages, and many of their ceremonies and super- 
stitions, these people are today substantially the same as 
they must have been before the white man’s influence had 
been brought to bear upon them; and when you get into 
the mountains, you are among a people practically un- 
touched by civilization.’’™ 
Education must accept the task both of removing as 
far as possible from man the element of fear and also 
of instilling in man positive courage which will give him 
the impetus to tackle new undertakings, adventure with 
ruth, cast aside worn out superstitions, and develop the 
disposition to face reality squarely even if it means the 
ainful necessity of changing old habits for new.

CHAPTER VII 
Tue Soctau SIgNIFICANCE or ANGER 
_~ The pugnacious instinct, with its corresponding emotion, 
anger, is another member of the ego hierarchy. When 
self-assertion is seriously hampered, anger or fear origin- 
ates. Anger is the aggressive reaction to attacks upon self- 
interest; fear is the contrary reaction connected with self- 
preservation. Anger leads one to assail the offender; fear 
impels retreat. The angry man tries to fight; the fright- 
ened person attempts to get away from the impending 
danger. Both fear and anger are violent reactions, each 
being one of the strongest emotional experiences known 
to human experience. In rage, the entire personality is 
captive to the emotion that has resulted from the reduction 
of self-feeling. The evolutionary value of rage has of 
course been great, since in primitive times it has secured 
the survival of those who have been most forcefully driven 
by this emotion to the attack. Thus anger in the earlier 
history of men had a greater significance than at present 
as a factor of social survival. Its significance is still great 
and its importance both in personal and group behavior 
is largely open to over-emphasis. 
Anger has had such biological meaning that the organism 
has been adjusted to the emotion so as to produce under 
its influence the maximum strength of the body. The 
muscles become tense. The jaw sets. The body advances. 
The teeth show themselves after the manner of the lower 
animals. The blood is affected chemically by adrenalin, the 
product of the adrenal gland, in a way that tends to pre- 
vent the realization of fatigue. It is thought also that the 
102
-P-A-G-E-115
  
~~ 
THE SOCIAL SIGNIFICANCE OF ANGER 103 ) 
adrenalin aids the coagulation of the blood and thereby 
reduces the risk of hemorrhage when the individual be- 
comes wounded. In other words, anger prepares the body 
for the fighting function. 
Watson™ tells us that anger in its earliest childhood 
expression is related to situations that hamper the infant’s 
movements. For example the holding of the child’s head 
produces in him at once the physical expressions of rage. 
The child starts erying, the body stiffens, the arms and legs 
correlate in striking movements, the breath is held until 
the face of the child reddens. From birth, almost any baby 
can be thrown into a rage by holding its arms tightly to 
its sides. Any one who has hampered a young child in 
any of its body movements can testify to the ease with 
which anger can be produced. 
Although anger produces in the body its maximum fight- 
ing strength it nevertheless frequently so clouds judgment 
that in the contests characteristic of modern life fierce 
anger may act as a handicap in a struggle. The prize- 
fighter, for example, who loses his temper is likely to suffer 
defeat as a consequence of his impulsive, imprudent actions. 
This explains the purpose of those who in an athletic 
contest attempt to stir up anger in their opponents. Anger 
in spite of its energizing quality interferes with skill 
and the self-control necessary for successful competition. 
This illustrates the decreasing value of anger in modern 
life. 
The risk of temper is so generally recognized that par- 
ents usually attempt from the beginning to train children 
not to give way to anger. No instinct receives more social 
coercion; no instinct is more frowned upon by parents 
and teachers than is pugnacity. The child is forced very

haviorist, p. 200. 
   
-P-A-G-E-116
  104 PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL ADJUSTMENT 
early to attempt the control of anger. Morality, religion, 
law, public opinion, continue the repression which began in 
the home. Society at every point puts its stamp of dis- 
approval upon exhibitions of anger in the ordinary asso- 
ciations of life. We cover up as far as possible any out- 
ward evidence of our anger unless we feel sure that it 
will be shared by our associates or unless we know it will 
be recognized as so devoid of personal attitude as to be 
considered righteous indignation. We impose upon our- 
selves penance after the manner of O. Henry’s husband, 
who always after indulging in a family row gave to his 
wife something eagerly coveted by her. Therefore he was 
purposely enraged by his wife that she might enjoy the 
proceeds of her matrimonial strategy. Those of tender 
conscience fight even the faintest suggestion of anger and 
perhaps by the process of repression create complexes that 
find eventually some circuitous method of expressing the 
long pent-up emotion. 
It is certainly one of the constant strains of modern 
life that so many situations irritate and lead naturally to 
the emotion of anger while social opinion is at the same 
time restricting its expression. The body machinery is put 
in preparation for the old-time primitive attack, and the 
individual, well trained by years of social discipline, hardly 
lifts an eye-lid. The repression Freud makes so much of 
with reference to the instinct of sex, the social stimulating 
and repressing of the emotion, is even more noticeable in 
the case of the pugnacious instinct and the emotion of 
anger. Much of the fatigue of our social relationships 
is the natural consequence of circumstances that create in 
us sensitiveness to attacks upon our self-feeling. Conscious- 
ness is easily possessed by the attitude that in the savage 
world leads to murder, while at the same time prudential 
considerations, the control that has been inculeated from

early childhood, block any outward expression of the emo- 
tion, thus putting upon the organism the strain of inhibit- 
ing energy socially produced. 
nger needs more than repression.—Harly education 
must reduce to a minimum the child’s reaction to anger 
by preventing not merely the expression, but also the origin 
of angere™The home and school teaching should put em- 
phasis upon the fact that it is the coming of anger even 
more than its expression that indicates faulty self-control. 
The hiding of anger, to be sure, indicates a degree of 
control, but not enough to prepare one to meet the 
exigencies of social contacts. It merely makes one a 
victim of a disturbing experience so hostile to one’s 
social well-being that ordinary prudence leads to its con- 
cealment. Whether or not others know of our anger, 
the fact is registered in the nervous mechanism and strain 
is created which acts as a handicap in the enterprise of 
life. 
The best discipline for the pugnacious instinct, therefore, 
is the production of a self-feeling that does not respond to 
ordinary coercion with any emotional reaction. The key 
to the problem of control of temper centers in the building 
up of a wholesome and sensible ego-attitude. One must 
learn not to take himself too seriously. Any inferiority 
which is bound to encourage sensitiveness requires specific 
treatment. The strategy of the educator directs the atten- 
tion to the construction of self-assertive habits that pe 
make the stimulation of anger difficult. 
It would be a grave mistake, however, to attempt the 
absolute elimination of anger. Not only are the milder 
forms of pugnacity socially indispensable, but characteristic 
anger, intense to the point of violence, is at times the only 
rational reaction to a definite set of circumstances. It 
antagonizes fear and permits an aggressive attitude in the  
-P-A-G-E-118
  106 PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL ADJUSTMENT 
place of cowardice. It is, however, when anger is socialized 
and is felt with reference to the injury inflicted upon 
others rather than upon the ego itself that anger shows 
forth its largest value for modern man. The anger that 
Lincoln is said to have felt upon his first visit to the New 
Orleans slave mart demonstrates the indispensable moral 
value anger provides for the energizing of reform. So long 
as exploitation, deceit, cruelty and false teaching are found 
in social experience there is need of a pugnacity, refined 
by socialization, which can give momentum to righteous 
indignation and make one sensitive to the sufferings of 
others. 
The influence of the socializing process upon man’s 
behavior is shown by the fact that conflict in the wide 
sense has largely supplanted pugnacity in its most narrow 
significance. If the social group largely frowns upon 
anger, it certainly tolerates and even admires conflict. 
Conflict derives vitality from the self-assertive tendencies 
of human nature, but it escapes the turbulent character- 
istics of the emotion of anger. The influence of the herd 
clearly operates upon conflict. The struggle has an element 
that suggests the play-spirit. Though the struggle may 
be intense and may bring forth all the resources an indi- 
vidual has to expend, yet there is lacking the deep sense 
of self-feeling which anger affords. The love of conflict 
may easily turn to anger, but in that case the entire mental 
attitude changes and becomes something different from 
what it was in the beginning. Conflict represents a social 
sublimation of primitive pugnacity, a refining of the anti- 
social instinct until through the modification produced by 
gregarious influence the elemental constituents of conflict 
and rivalry become concealed. 
Rivalry, for perhaps the term most satisfactorily ex- 
presses the connotation of modern socialized conflict, is an
-P-A-G-E-119
THE SOCIAL SIGNIFICANCE OF ANGER 107 
attempt to advance personal prestige and is therefore a 
positive expression of self-assertion. Anger reacts to an 
attack made upon the self, while rivalry attempts to win 
for the self social recognition or at least the satisfaction 
of the knowledge that prestige is deserved. Rivalry there- 
fore has to conform to the traditions and customs that 
regulate the struggles that provide opportunity for the 
gaining of prestige. From the first he who contests with 
another must conform, for only so can he hope for any 
measure of distinction. Even the street fight of the school 
boy has its rigid code of things permitted and not per- 
mitted. Unless angered, he who enters a contest considers 
the ‘‘rules of the game,’’ the ‘‘behavior of a good sport,’’ 
and by his attention to the regulations he reveals the social 
element of the contest. 
The desire for prestige, although more socialized than 
the self-assertion of anger, is nevertheless a very important 
egoistic reaction. A very large part of the doings of any 
man—far more than he ever recognizes—must be charged 
up to the craving for prestige, the result of success in 
competition and conflict. 
The craving for prestige shows its influence very clearly 
in both the dream and the day-dream. In revery, self- 
assertion constantly appears in myriad forms. What could 
be more natural than for imagination to produce such 
pictures as give to the dreamer a sense of success and im- 
portance, denied by the actual conditions? In this way 
the barren and unhappy life finds in the magic of fancy 
compensation and satisfaction. Of what is the school child 
day-dreaming? What causes the smile to pass over his 
face as he sits supposedly performing his assigned task? 
The pleasant thought has not been taken from the print 
lof his book, but from the self-seeking desire that has called 
into activity the omnipotent fancy. Now he is experiencing 
 
-P-A-G-E-120
  
108 PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL ADJUSTMENT 
what he most wants. How often it is distinction, prestige, 
that he covets. The form of contest familiar to him, the 
prestige most recognized by his associates, these determine 
the content of his fancy. 
These reveries do more than pay tribute to the strength 
of the craving for successful rivalry. They are also for 
all who feel the pain of a suppressed self—and who, at 
times, does not ?—emotional compensations. The toil-driven 
captive of machine industry dreams her way into freedom 
and luxury and prestige. She steadies herself amid cir- 
cumstances that unrelieved might drive her to despair, and 
revels in the creations of her own magic. In conversation 
regarding one’s own career, who escapes the slight distor- 
tions, false emphasis and bright coloring of past behavior 
that give to the reciter a sense of acting the hero? Of 
course this playing with reality has its risks. It may easily 
pass over into a disastrous inability to separate fact from 
fancy. 
The universality of play with reality demonstrates its 
essentially protective function. It gives at times a mean- 
ing to the life that the naked, cold facts deny. It allows 
a taste of prestige to those whose self-feeling is famished. 
Thus it makes life tolerable when otherwise it could hardly 
be endured. It also stimulates perhaps to later self-expres- 
sion and resulting real prestige. Then we pronounce the 
reverie, vision. It has a social significance also in its 
ability to make acceptable social conditions that might 
cause social aversions leading to class antipathy, were it 
not that the more favored provide day-dreaming symbols 
for those less fortunate. The king and queen, the lord 
and lady, and the millionaire are socially secure as long 
as they are worked into the symbolic reveries of the peasant 
and the poor, and by the process of idealization are made} 
to seem socially appropriate and desirable.
-P-A-G-E-121
  THE SOCIAL SIGNIFICANCE OF ANGER 109 
The revery also functions as a means of compensation 
for anger denied adequate expression. G. Stanley Hall’ 
tells of the adolescent girl, who is hurt by the taunts of 
her friend, and becomes angry; then gains revenge by 
picturing herself at the funeral of the friend. She re- 
hearses the entire proceeding and imagines herself listening 
to remarks reflecting upon the character of the deceased. 
After the completion of her emotional indulgence, the day- 
dream returns to reality, she makes up with her friend and 
even shows solicitude for the latter’s health. Similar expe- 
riences by which revenge is obtained through the use of 
the phantasy are familiar to those who deal with children 
or who vividly recall their own childhood. 
A type of play-acting among children which uses the 
mechanism of phantasy as a means of ‘‘getting even’’ 
ecasionally leads to suicide. The child feels that he has 
een wronged by someone dear to him and thinks over his 
ad treatment until he builds up the idea of hurting the 
ffender by causing his own death. He pictures the regret 
£ the person responsible for his suffering, and may develop 
he plan of carrying out the idea of suicide sufficiently to 
in back the attention and the love of the person who 
as been guilty of the harsh treatment. A method is chosen 
hich is expected to give the idea of serious intent with- 
ut actually proving successful. Unfortunately, mistakes 
re sometimes made and actual suicide results. For 
xample, a young high school girl, angered by criticism 
rom her mother attempted suicide under circumstances 
hat made it clear that she did not intend really to kill 
erself. Nevertheless she nearly paid with her life for 
Ihe make-believe, since her rescue from the water into which 
he threw herself in the presence of several on-lookers was

  110 PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL ADJUSTMENT 
finally accomplished only with great difficulty, due to thi 
excitement that followed her act. Doubtless many of th 
suicides of children result in this way. 
The following case illustrates a suicide which resultec 
from what was meant merely as a threat. ‘‘A girl of six 
teen and a half years, born in Massachusetts, of Italian 
parentage, a Roman Catholic, worked in a paper factory 
She was described as one of the best girls in the factory 
She had mixed up a dose of Paris green the year before 
following a suicidal threat. She had a sweetheart, wit! 
whom she went to church every day during Holy Week 
He was planning to go away, and she feared that he woul 
desert her. On Easter he had asked her to wait dinne 
for him, and she had not done so. Upon his arrival, h 
was angry, and she went to the cellar for fruit and whil 
there drank Paris green. She was taken to a hospital 
where she said that she did not want to die, and that sh 
was extremely sorry, but she subsequently died. Ther 
was no evidence of pregnancy.’ 
Indeed suicide itself, as has been said, expresses | 
peculiar negative expression of self-feeling. In certai 
aspects it suggests the reverse of anger reactions, a turnin 
against the self with a hostility that has in it elements 0 
both pride and despair. Suicide ‘‘often appears to be 
reaction to certain states of mind, corresponding to t 
blow in anger or to flight in fear, or any gesture. It ma 
be conceived as a superlative in expressing the emotio 
of negative self-feeling. Just as the most extreme expre! 
sion of rage is, ‘I’ll kill you,’ so an analogous expressio 
in grief is, ‘I wish I were dead.’ In fact a great. deal 
the legal reasoning concerning homicide may be appli 
to suicide, and cases of self-destruction fall rough

nto three groups, corresponding to the three degrees of 
nurder. 
“In anger there is an impulse to strike. The blow may 
ye directed at a door or a tree. The blow, and not its 
esult, is the important thing to be considered. To be 
ure, certain cases involve premeditation, and the intel- 
ectual element seems important, but analysis reveals that 
n most cases at least emotion is dominating reason. So 
t is in the case of many suicides. This negative self- 
eeling leads to a distinctive turning upon self, the Reon 
ishing to kill himself rather than to die.’’™ 
Suggestive of the phantasy created for compensation is 
e habit of those who turn their ordinary activities into 
lonflicts. The child, for example, sometimes thinks of his 
sk in algebra or Latin translation as a sort of battle in 
hich his strength is being tried. In the same manner 
e business man conceives of his competition as a conflict 
hich tests his qualities of character in a way that makes 
ecess an advancement of self-esteem and failure the 
casion of reproach. The purpose in this semi-type of 
Ihantasy is self-stimulation. The individual responds to 
e idea of struggle when it is made a test of fighting 
ility in a way impossible for the person who thinks of 
in the unimaginative form of business competition. Men 
success tend toward this mechanism, and they are there- 
re legitimately considered descendants of the primitive 
mter. 
It is also true that there is in everyone a tendency to 
act to impersonal obstacles as if they embodied the 
tagonistic opposition of some specific individual. One 
0 is delayed by the breaking down of railroad trans- 
rtation finds it very easy to generate anger which is 
rned against some person who to the delayed passenger

is representative of the railroad itself. Of course rational 
thought would reveal in most such cases that the difficulty 
was not caused by the inefficiency of any one individual, 
certainly not by the particular official who chanced to be 
the victim of the delayed passenger’s anger. 
In much the same way that the savage was wont to 
personify all the occurrences of the natural world, so the 
modern man when his purposes are thwarted finds it diffi- 
cult to maintain a rational attitude toward his obstructions. 
If angry, he is best satisfied by having a sense of personal 
grievance, for: this permits his emotion to flow out freely 
toward some person. It adds to the wear and tear of life 
that so many of the impersonal happenings, bound to occur 
in an environment where so much is contributed by ma- 
chinery, are reacted to as if they were deliberate expres- 
sions of ill will by those in power. The agitator makes 
large use of this tendency of human nature to personify 
the source of discontent; from it he creates pugnacity 
toward some person or organization which is selected as| 
object for the expression of the emotion. If the agitator] 
can create enough feeling, the emotion generated can easily! 
be affixed by insinuation and suggestion to the object chosen 
to receive the hostility. 
The politician makes use of this process in a lesser degree| 
in order to create an attitude of mind which will make his| 
followers too deeply partisan to be conscious of their own| 
misthinking or to feel the force of the arguments of his| 
opponent. 
The supreme example of the solidifying use of pugnacit; 
is the work of the militarist who fans to a flame all possibl 
national prejudice, misapprehension and past grievance 
to produce a hostility that will sweep even prudence asid 
and force through public opinion a costly war. It wa: 
the use of this process by Bismarck that occasioned th  
-P-A-G-E-125
THE SOCIAL SIGNIFICANCE OF ANGER 113 
unfortunate Franco-Prussian war. As the historians now 
tell us, Bismarck created in France an outburst of anger 
which forced the entire nation into the trap which had 
been set for it. 
In so far as we are isolated in our associations and do 
not understand those with whom we have no contact, we 
are more susceptible to this manipulation of pugnacity by 
the agitator or partisan. In the present warfare between 
capital and labor it is evident that the isolation which 
modern industry produces adds largely to the hostile emo- 
tions which make codperation between the two parts of 
modern business so exceedingly difficult. Pugnacity, there- 
fore, as it expresses itself in mass action is a very pro- 
foundly solidifying influence. An angry crowd moves in 
its riotous outburst as one man. Discussion, deliberation 
and criticism are forced into abeyance while the anger 
vents itself. 
In our treatment of the criminal there still linger 
the marks of crowd pugnacity. The good citizen reacts 
o the criminal as to an enemy, since from the view- 
oint of orderly society, especially with reference to the 
institution of property, the criminal is destructive of social 
ecurity, of social values. His activities, therefore, chal- 
enge the well-being of all. He receives the hostility of 
he good citizen and even from his own viewpoint recog- 
izes that he has been made an outlaw. He wars upon 
ociety and society revenges itself upon him. For only 
0 does society believe that he can be prevented from his 
estructive ravages upon the values precious to the others. 
ate is a sort of chronic anger. It comes about when 
trong desires are blocked, especially when once pride is 
eriously hurt. Hatred is intense and demands for its 
atisfaction the humiliation of him who has been responsi- 
le for the emotion. Hatred spreads quickly through 
 
-P-A-G-E-126

a group when by the use of suggestion all the individuals 
come to have the same feeling of anger. Hatred particu- 
larly thrives where the sense of relationship has been lost. 
To emphasize the human resemblances between oneself and 
the hated person melts the emotion, and for that reason 
when one is caught by hatred he magnifies differences and 
resents any suggestion of likeness. Hate conceals its evil 
nature by clothing itself in the symbol of justice. As a 
consequence much vengeance which is supposedly just is 
really the creation of the monster, Hate, rationalized in 
order to escape the risk of social disapprobation. 
Envy has been defined by William McDougall as nega- 
tive self-feeling and anger. It is of course in relation to 
superiors that one feels envy. In such a situation, as 
McDougall has said, there often seems to be a feeling that 
the self has been injured, since the other by his more for- 
tunate possessions be-littles one’s self. There is also the 
feeling that one has been excluded because of the achieve- 
ment of the other. 
Jealousy is a characteristic, but mean reaction which 
seems to have in it elements of both anger and fear. It 
is found, as everybody knows, in animals.’ If one has had 
a dog as a pet, he is familiar with the immediate expres- 
sions of jealousy that follow when another animal is made 
much of. In early childhood also jealousy shows itself 
frequently and clearly. Jealousy as a rule is expressed 
when a relationship of affection appears to be threatened 
by some other association. This explains why jealousy 
is so often related to experiences of sex. The more exclu- 
sive the affection, the more easily jealousy is produced 
The coming of jealousy is largely an individual matter. 
Some natures are easily excited to jealousy, while a noble 
type appears entirely free of it. Society frowns upon exhibi 
tions of jealousy, and that is why one who is jealou: 
 
-P-A-G-E-127
  
THE SOCIAL SIGNIFICANCE OF ANGER 115 
usually tends to hide the feeling. This is one of the dan- 
gerous elements of jealousy. It may be strongly felt and 
altogether concealed from the person who is destined to 
receive the hostility of the emotion. 
In jealousy as in the other anti-social expressions of 
anger, the results of early training show forth clearly. 
The parents can do most to eliminate from the developing 
child the unfortunate experiences of temper, hate, envy 
and jealousy. Children who tend to develop anger easily 
ean be greatly helped by a constructive program in the 
home. Their health should be particularly conserved, since 
physical influences contribute so much to habits of anger. 
Self-expression also should receive every possible assistance, 
for the psychic basis of temper is often a deep, underlying 
sense of inferiority. Larger social contacts should be 
encouraged, for isolation is the social element especially 
involved in hate, envy and jealousy. Most of all, the child 
must be trained to a proper sense of values. It is the 
change in estimation that destroys anti-social pugnacity. 
It is because of this that the tragedy has such a purg- 
ing quality. Robert Browning is one of many poets who 
illustrate how quickly change in viewpoint, due to a better 
sense of values, turns hatred into pity. In his poems, 
“Before,’’ and ‘‘After,’? Browning introduces us to the 
mood before the duel and that which follows when death 
has intervened and the flood-tide of anger passed.

  CHAPTER VIII 
THE SoctaL SIGNIFICANCE or SEX 
“~The sex instinct with its corresponding emotion of love 
» is one of the strongest of all the instincts, and none is 
~ more important for social life. Were it not for the sex 
instinet there would of course be no perpetuation of the 
species and society would necessarily come to an end. Its 
importance, however, is greater than merely to bring off- 
spring into the world. The sex instinct has been worked 
upon by sdciil-experience until it expresses itself in num- 
berless different actYvities, many of them so far removed 
from the original sourceythat nothing but skillful analysis 
reveals the relationship. “It is particularly in the psychic 
and social life that these derivatives of the instinct show 
themselves. The instinct also combines in every conceiy- 
able way with the other instincts so that it forms only 
a component part of a complex attitude or activity, which 
nevertheless can not be thoroughly understood apart from 
its connection with sex. 
Although this instinct has been modified in such a 
marked degree by social tradition, custom and other forms 
of coercion, it is by no means weaker than the more simp] 
instinct of savage life. Quite the contrary. In spite of 
the fact that it has been turned to so many different means| 
of expression, it has increased its original intensity s 
that even from the viewpoint of mere physical sex modern| 
man is more powerfully sexual than his earlier predecessors, 
The instinct, in its physical aspect, is racial in its signifi 
cance in that it is the necessary basis for human survival 
So far as the experience of the individual is concerned. 
118

however, sex appears so individualistic that it even seems 
essentially anti-social. It is this fact that forces the group 
to place social restraint upon this instinct to a greater 
degree than upon any of the other instincts. 
Dr. Sigmund Freud has focussed the attention of the 
psychologists and the sociologists upon the sex instinct. 
The Freudian psychology places great emphasis upon sex 
as a motive of human control. By his study of the neurotic, 
Freud was led to the conviction that sex had a much larger 
psychic significance than had previously been supposed. 
As a result of his investigations Freud developed a psy- 
chological theory which is known as ‘‘the Freudian psy- 
chology.’’ Although to many psychologists and sociolo- 
gists Freud appears to put an excessive importance upon 
ex, it is now generally admitted that any satisfactory 
interpretation of human conduct must necessarily give a 
arge place to sex. Freud, therefore, has influenced think- 
mg to a very great extent. He has failed, however, thus 
ar to win the following of the majority of psychologists 
Ithough unquestionably his influence upon the science has 
een greater than that of any one else. His doctrine has 
een modified somewhat, both by himself and especially 
y some of his former disciples who have eventually 
eveloped a school of thought of their own. 
Freud claims to discover evidences of sex instinct in 
e very early days of childhood. Much depends upon 
ow the instinct is defined. There are certainly responses 
m the part of the child to tickling and stroking that are 
timations of later sex reactions. These early responses 
ire not generally considered to be real sex experiences. 
owever, there is a disposition amongst all psychologists 
push the expression of sex back into earlier years than 
rmerly they did. Certainly there are in infancy begin- 
ings of sex attraction that have a great deal to do with    
    
        
    
       
        
-P-A-G-E-132
  120 PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL ADJUSTMENT 
the mature sex experience. Indeed the normality of mature 
sex life largely depends upon the treatment received by 
the child at the time of these early experiences. 
No instinet develops such a quantity of emotion as does 
sex, if the instinct is interpreted in its widest modern 
expression. Love itself is a striking illustration of the 
tremendous strength and the magnitude of an emotion for 
the most part a product of sex. Love, even of parent and 
child, undoubtedly has a sex element. The same is true 
in all the varying degrees of association and friendship of 
the two sexes, from the adolescent period onward. The 
intimate influence of sex upon mental life has been demon- 
strated time and time again by the social experiences of 
mankind. It seems, for instance, to be a fact revealed by 
the experiences of various peoples that a precocious 
development of physical sex tends to have a retarding and 
even deadening effect upon the mind. At least it is the 
testimony of savage life that where the initiation of the 
boys, as in certain Australian tribes, is followed by the 
beginning of physical sex relationships, the mentality im- 
mediately becomes static and intellectual progress hence- 
forth is difficult. Professor Ross affirms the same thing to be| 
true in the mental experience of the South American boys. 
Every schoolmaster of experience realizes from intimate 
knowledge that no disturbance so quickly discloses itself 
in mental life as do conflicts that have a sex origin. Not 
only do they frequently make study difficult, but they even| 
extend to activities that have moral and social significance, 
The sex instinct changes with the developing of th 
growing personality, from its most elemental appearane 
to the final passing of the physical powers of the sex life 
Indeed, psychically there is every reason to suppose tha’ 
sex usually extends beyond the time of physical vitality. 
often influencing the emotional life even more seriousl,

than when the body had its normal functions. At every 
stage of this development modifications of mental, includ- 
ing emotional, experience must necessarily occur. The life 
has to be adjusted as it changes from one type of love- 
fixation to another. The dangers of this program are 
pointed out in chapter thirteen and need not here be given 
much attention. There is always the possibility of infantile 
fixation, which leaves the individual stranded upon a lower 
level of development than was his right; and as a result 
his individuality suffers retardation. | 
This possibility of arrest becomes one of the most serious 
concerns of parent and teacher. Such intimacy with the 
child must be maintained that he naturally and freely offers 
fellowship and thus makes it possible for his older asso- 
ciates to recognize the significance of the events in his sex- 
maturing progress. If from any cause the child shuts 
himself up or by processes of deceit hides from his older 
associates the deeper experiences of his sex life, a founda- 
tion is laid for a complex which in time may make whole- 
lsomeness and happiness next to impossible. The parent 
land the teacher therefore have an opportunity to obtain 
through sympathy an insight into the changing character 
f the sex life of the child. They must necessarily avoid 
uspicion and harsh criticism. They must regard reason- 
bly the meaning of a sex attitude by considering it with 
eference to the time at which it appears. This is par- 
icularly true with reference to masturbation, which is 
ertainly a very common phenomenon in the early life of 
oys, and perhaps much more common amongst girls than 
t present is supposed. Masturbation is often reacted to 
0 violently by older people that the child is even terror- 
tricken and left helpless with reference to a habit which, 
isely treated, would most certainly pass out of the life.

becomes charged with such emotional shame and reproach 
that there recur from that time onward occasional feel- 
ings of moral and social inferiority that tremendously 
injure the developing of the personality. In a lingering 
superstition these untoward social and psychie and 
* moral results are charged up to the physical act itself and 
thereby strengthen an erroneous belief which becomes one 
of the crushing experiences of childhood. 
Sex requires sublimation. This means that the physical 
element of sex is necessarily largely checked and the energy 
urned into other activities. Human society can not escape 
the ordeal of such sublimation. The animals are protected 
from excessive sex behavior by the periodicity of the 
appearance of the instinct. In human beings there is no 
such protection, at least among men. Therefore if there 
were no social influences at work to hold in check this 
powerful instinct, a large part of the energy of human 
nature required for the complexity of civilized existence 
would be drawn into mere physical sex. 
Even the savage does not escape the necessity of some 
degree of control. Although his problem is certainly less 
than that of modern man and ordinarily the stimulations 
that waken sex are fewer, even he could not maintain the 
degree of social organization that he has, were it not for 
his social processes of sex control. These are particularly 
illustrated by taboo. “Taboo is a means of social coercion, 
built upon fear; it is irresistible. Trained from earliest 
childhood to accept the taboo, dreading with perfect terror 
the consequences of its violation, the savage easily con- 
forms to the conduct imposed upon him, which, however 
different it may be from that of modern life, is nevertheless 
largely restrictive. Taboos are not exclusively related to 
sex, but predominantly so, for no instinct in savage so- 
ciety has such possibilities of unsocial behavior.
-P-A-G-E-135
  
THE SOCIAL SIGNIFICANCE OF SEX 123 
Since sex is so thoroughly coerced by custom and by law, 
phantasy, as one would expect, is one of the methods by 
which an individual escapes from the restrictions that 
hamper inner desire. A very great deal of day-dreaming, 
especially in early youth, concentrates about sex. Because 
of the enormous strength of the group influence and the 
impression left upon the person by his early training, in 
large measure this revery is not clearly sexual but deals 
with secondary aspects of the instinct rather than with 
the physical act itself. This is especially true of girls, 
but although the phantasy dilutes the elemental sex, there 
can be no question regarding the origin of the emotional 
activities. Sex in its psychic aspects sweeps into the ado- 
lescent life with such tremendous strength that to some 
extent it has to pass over into phantasy; and the most 
matter-of-fact adolescent hardly escapes altogether day- 
dreaming that is primarily based upon sex interest. The 
profound experience of the dream also illustrates the vigor 
of the instinct, particularly in the first years of physical 
sex maturity. 
Suggestion and emotional association frequently show 
themselves in perversions that are perhaps accidental varia- 
tions in the expressions of sex. These perversions are also 
of a more serious character, resulting from the breaking 
down of the mental stability of the person and an undue 
magnifying of some secondary element which would nat- 
urally play a very minor part in normal sex attitudes. A 
horrible perversion is the development of cruelty to the 
opposite sex as a substitute for normal sex relationships. 
Much more common and socially disadvantageous is the 
development of slight homosexual tendencies due to the 
effort to check normal sex interest and the accidental 
opportunity of bestowing upon a member of one’s own 
sex affection that rightly belongs to those of the other sex. 
   
-P-A-G-E-136
  124 PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL ADJUSTMENT 
This form of fixation has also been treated in chapter four- 
teen and needs no description at this point. 
Courtship represents a peculiar sex experience which is 
as emotional as any lengthy experience of life. It has in 
it necessarily a very large element of phantasy and ex- 
presses itself to some extent on the part of both man and 
woman, but especially boy and girl, in play-acting. It is 
in large measure the emotional content of an experience 
that stimulates physical sex and at the same time checks 
its expression. It also conveys all the earlier idealism that 
has been taught the individual with reference to sex rela- 
tionship. It paints the future in the brightest possible 
colors. It invigorates the personality often to the maxi- 
mum of physical attractiveness. It forces out of conscious- 
ness, especially in the young, all prudential considerations. 
No experience is so self-forgetting, until a rival invades 
the sacred relationship and then tremendous jealousy fol- 
lows. Former affection may even be replaced by intense 
hatred. 
It is not surprising that marriage has so many emotional 
disturbances in its beginning, when it is remembered that 
the two captives of the emotion which has been running 
so strongly in the courtship now have to come down to 
the realities of life and face unexpected and undesired 
responsibilities. The emotion largely passes. In its place 
remains the memory of the experience that once was. He 
or she that has remained infantile in sex development pro- 
tests against the necessity of adjusting to the new condition 
of things. The partner is accused of having failed in his 
affection and as a result the marriage may be wrecked. 
The insurance against such a disaster must be taken out 
in the early years of childhood. The courtship may not 
be so highly emotional and actually therefore have lasting 
vitality. This has been recognized by the proverbs that
-P-A-G-E-137
  THE SOCIAL SIGNIFICANCE OF SEX 125 
record human experience in all times and places, as, for 
instance, this of the Africans of the Guinea coast: ‘‘Quick 
love a woman means quick not loving a woman.”’ 
‘‘Marry in haste, repent at leisure’ is our own version. 
Shakespeare says: 
“Love moderately: long love doth so. 
Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow.” 
Byron reports that: 
“Love bears within itself the very germ 
Of change, and how should this be otherwise? 
That violent things more quickly find a term 
Is shown through nature’s whole analogies.” 
Now that marriage tends to be entered upon later, as 
everywhere is the case amongst the more intellectual classes, 
courtship itself becomes more moral and intellectual and 
escapes very largely the excessive expressions of phantasy. 
Sex leads on to marriage and the original instinct acquires 
a new meaning as parenthood ensues. With the coming of 
parenthood appears a different instinctive response which 
has been called by William McDougall ‘‘tender emotion,’’ 
and which is usually defined as the parental instinct. The 
parental instinct with its corresponding emotion runs 
deeper than the original sex instinct and tends to a more 
permanent emotional quality. It is fortunate that the 
child’s welfare is protected by so tremendous and instine- 
tive a response. Perhaps originally the parental instinct 
extended over only the earlier period of the child’s life. 
In any case modern society makes the parent’s attitude 
co-extensive with his life in normal cases and thus the cause 
of the child’s arrest due to parental exploitation, as dis- 
cussed in chapters thirteen and fourteen. The purpose of 
 
-P-A-G-E-138
  
  126 PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL ADJUSTMENT 
the parental instinct is, of course, the securing of the wel- 
fare of the offspring and it necessarily has to have a very 
enduring foundation. In the normal home sex and parent- 
hood coalesce so that it is difficult to separate the two 
instinets. The father and mother are not only interested 
in one another but they are mutually cemented together 
by a compelling regard for their offspring. In this way 
the relationship between physical sex and its ally, parental 
instinct, comes out clearly. Perhaps the best way to under- 
stand the two instinctive responses is to consider them both 
part of the larger, inclusive sex complex. In such a case 
the interests that gather about sex, instinctive in origin, 
would have three distinct expressions—physical sex, com- 
radeship with the opposite sex, and an emotional attitude 
toward the offspring. 
Society obtains from the affection that naturally passes 
from parent to child greater value than merely the per- 
petuation of the home. A large part of altruism roots 
itself in this affection. Men and women who are denied 
parenthood sublimate this element of the sex complex to a 
considerable extent by their interest in others, especially in 
children. It has been an abounding source for the tender- 
ness which more and more becomes characteristic of human 
society. It is to do justice to this fact that Professor Wil- 
liam McDougall defines the emotion connected with the 
parental instinct as the ‘‘tender emotion.’? Although 
tender emotion is found among animals it is normally con- 
centrated. In the case of highly organized human beings, 
however, it is spread over a wide territory of social 
contacts and becomes a large component of what we 
eall benevolence. It is therefore indispensable to human 
progress and should not be confined entirely to any 
home. It enriches social experience to its fullest extent. 
Nothing, therefore, demonstrates more clearly the tre-
-P-A-G-E-139

mendous importance of the parental element of the sex 
eomplex than does its influence in extending sympathy into 
the group. 
—The child that is to develop wholesome personality must 
receive some kind of sex education just as he must have 
assistance in developing the right attitude along other lines 
of instinctive interests. This education, however, can not 
consist merely in the getting of knowledge. More than he 
wants knowledge he wants development of proper attitudes. 
The problem, therefore, of sex education is the larger 
problem of developing the character as a whole. In moral 
training there can not be absolute neglect of the sex aspects 
without injury to the character. On the other hand, sex 
can not be treated with any degree of success as a thing 
by itself which needs for its training only the giving to 
éhe boy or girl of some definite instruction. 
me can not go far in the problem of sex education with- 
out recognizing the serious need of educating parents so 
that they can give to their children from the beginning 
wholesome attitudes toward sex. The school child, even 
though very young, has already begun his sex training, 
and before the school authorities can contribute much to 
sex wholesomeness the boy or girl has acquired notions of 
sex that are likely to be immensely important for the rest 
of life. It is to the parent, therefore, that we must more 
and more look for help in preventing the origin of sex 
difficulties. Surely the parent is ill-prepared to do this 
unless he himself receives some instruction. This society 
is likely to see clearly, and in America at least, by one 
means or another, parents will be given the sympathy and 
understanding and point of view which will mean most to 
the growing child. It is encouraging to find so many 
parents who have prepared themselves to give to their chil- 
dren instruction in sex and who have made possible for 
     
                             
-P-A-G-E-140
a 128 PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL ADJUSTMENT 
their children more wholesome attitudes toward sex than 
they themselves had in their childhood. 
The parent does not have to arouse sex interest, but 
only to discover it when it appears in the child. It will 
surely come, for curiosity with reference to sex is normal 
in every child and has just the same significance that any 
other curiosity has. The sense of mystery so often put 
about sex results in making the curiosity seem different 
- because it is so lacking in frankness. 
Many parents have the erroneous idea that sex educa- 
tion is particularly concerned with the dangers of venereal 
disease and other consequences of vice. This point of view 
is most unfortunate. The child, especially the girl, can be 
made to react against sex by stress upon its pathological 
side so that it can never be a thoroughly normal or whole- 
some element in the life. Doubtless in the past sex educa- 
tion everywhere has overstressed venereal disease. The 
positive note needs to be struck. The sex life must be 
made idealistic and socially responsible. Mere prudence 
provides a shaky foundation for any sex education pro- 
gram. It is important that the parent give this positive 
attitude toward the entire sex life to the child before the 
latter comes in contact with playmates who will impress 
the opposite standpoint. This consideration makes it im- 
perative that the parent be close enough to his child to 
detect the first expressions of sex curiosity. 
It must not be thought that the parent should deliver 
a long lecture with great detail when the child asks a 
simple question which has in it sex content. o-The good 
way is to give the child about as much as he asks for and] 
take it for granted that at some other time more informa- 
tion will be required. If the child finds that his firs‘ 
question is answered satisfactorily, he will not be slo 
in bringing later questions, as they arise, to the sam

authority that met his earlier need. The parent will find 
that however explicit he may be, he is likely to be mis- 
understood and at a later time he will be called on to 
straighten out the tangle, or to give again information 
he thought he had given plainly enough. This is on account 
of the child’s inability to take to himself more than his 
maturity demands. In the child whose questionings are 
frankly answered by a trustworthy person, no morbid 
curiosity will arise, and gradually he will develop whole- 
some attitudes toward sex, just as his personality develops

CHAPTER Ix 
THe SoctaL SIGNIFICANCE OF GREGARIOUSNESS 
The life into which the child of modern civilized man 
born is intensely social. From the beginning the child 
activities are expressed in the presence of people who : 
once attempt to control and modify his behavior. As tl 
child develops and consciousness and attention appear, h 
interest is chiefly concentrated upon the people roun 
about. It follows therefore that the developing child 
influenced by his human environment in a way that sepa 
ates him from the animals, whose attention is so large! 
predetermined by instinct. So much of the life of tl 
child is concerned with the attitudes of the people wl 
have him under their control that it is impossible to di 
tinguish his interest in people, which is built upon a gr 
garious instinct, from his interest in them because the

rather than an advantage. 
There is considerable doubt amongst the psychologi: 
as to whether there is such an instinct as the gregario’

  SIGNIFICANCE OF GREGARIOUSNESS 133 
[here are many ways in which the gregarious behavior of 
1uman beings can be accounted for without assuming an 
wiginal instinct. The self-regarding instinct, especially as 
t shows itself in fear, would cause the individual to seek 
yregarious experience since in the group the individual 
‘eels safety. Indeed this is so certainly true of the primi- 
ive savage that in many eases the ostracizing of a man 
‘rom his tribe means death because without tribal protec- 
‘ion he is at the mercy of the first person he encounters. 
The self-regarding instinct as it influences the desire for 
yrestige necessarily turns the attention of the individual 
(0 the group, since to win standing with his fellows is 
the keenest pleasure he can have in his effort to exalt. 
1imself. Most psychologists still consider the gregarious. 
yehavior of man as primarily the result of an original 
nstinet. Although not all psychologists account for man’s 
rregarious tendency on the basis of a gregarious instinct, 
here is nevertheless general agreement as to the instinctive 
haracter of man’s gregarious conduct. There is nowhere 
ny disposition to deny the importance of the human gre- 
arious tendencies, whether the result of an instinct or 
erely the expression of a habit built upon various 
stinets, or produced by a combination of these causes. 
There can be no’ question as to the tremendous tendency 
lmongst human beings to flock together and to receive 
‘om one another stimulations. Indeed one of the pressing 
roblems of modern life is the excessive craving for the 
regarious environment, which seems to be characteristic 
civilized man the world around. 
The value that this desire for comradeship has had in 
man development can hardly be overemphasized. Lester 
ard, one of our foremost sociologists, stated the situation 
ry clearly when he wrote as follows: ‘‘For want of a 
tter name, I have characterized this social instinct, or 
 
-P-A-G-E-146
  1384 PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL ADJUSTMENT 
instinct of race safety, as religion, but not without clear]; 
perceiving that it constitutes the primordial undifferenti 
ated plasm out of which have subsequently developed al 
the more important human institutions. This... . if i 
be not an instinct, is at least the human homologue o: 
animal instinct, and served the same purpose after thi 
instincts had chiefly disappeared, and when the egotisti 
reason would otherwise have rapidly carried the race t 
destruction in its mad pursuit of pleasure for its ow1 
igake,”7) 
The gregarious activities are more modified by environ 
ment than ordinarily is true of man’s instinctive responses 
since he is sensitive to the attitudes of the group and con 
forms to it in his behavior. The sex and self-regarding 
instincts when stimulated. conform more largely to inne: 
disposition. The gregarious activity is not only arouse 
from outside stimulation, but the manner of the behavio: 
is colored by the external circumstances. From the very 
nature of the gregarious behavior there is therefore a ten 
dency not only to impress upon the individual strons 
incitations to activity but also to determine to a larg 
extent what the nature of these responses-shall be. 
It is often thought that man is gregarious only whe 
in association. This is a mistake, however, because it leave 
out the ability of the imagination to create the gregariou 
influence. One by himself may be keenly concerned wit 
the possible attitudes of his group with reference to hi 
behavior, even though he feels confident that what he do 
may not be known. The very thought of what would bj 
the attitude of his comrades were his action discovered hi 
influence upon him. No one can understand the signi 
eance of moral sensitivity unless he takes into account t 
(1) Ward, L., Pure Sociology, p. 134. See also pp. 200 and 55
-P-A-G-E-147
SIGNIFICANCE OF GREGARIOUSNESS 135 
way the gregarious attitude spreads itself over one’s life 
and keeps one in contact with the group socially through 
imagination even when physical relationship is denied. 
=Much of social solidarity must be charged up to the gre- 
yarious tendency in human nature. It leads us to develop 
what Giddings has called ‘‘consciousness of kind,’’ or the 
recognition of similarities in others which makes us feel 
friendliness in our associations. This consciousness of kind 
becomes a cementing influence and the group of individuals 
mder its influence becomes one structure. The gregarious 
esire drives us toward association and by the process of 
ontact we discover and develop similarities that provide 
basis for sympathy and consciousness of kind. No one 
an have any idea of the method of social control, who 
eaves out of account the significance of the gregarious 
ravings of men and women. Human nature is particularly 
ensitive to praise and blame. We all covet from our 
ssociates favorable opinions and react to their criticisms. 
his sensitiveness to general approval or disapproval be- 
comes the basis not only of our morality but more than 
nything else constructs every form of social control. In 
Ihe degree that one is lacking in the gregarious tendency, 
Ihe control has to be built upon a more intellectual type 
f self-criticism, for there is no substantial way of pro- 
ucing social discipline. 
The gregarious craving is related to sympathy. It is 
ot sympathy, however, although often mistaken for it. 
m producing a desire for contact, in bringing people 
ether, in making one person give attention to the reac- 
ions of another, it provides motives for sympathy. That 
is not itself sympathy is clearly shown by the following 
lustration. An individual living in a small village, find- 
g his gregarious desires largely unsatisfied, and reacting 
the trivialities of close contact, found it necessary in

  136 PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL ADJUSTMENT 
order to preserve sanity of mind in his social behavior tc 
visit a city occasionally and indulge in gregarious expe- 
rience. During the first days of such a visit he was most 
happy in wandering up and down the crowded streets, look. 
ing in the shop windows, mingling in the crowd and feeling 
himself lost in the great mass of people. Clearly he was 
satisfying his gregarious cravings. There was evidently 
no sympathy involved. If he came in contact with some 
friend who brought back the thought of his ordinary 
responsibilities, the pleasure was marred, even though he 
enjoyed the meeting itself. His profession demanded sym- 
pathy, and by disposition he was usually happy in express: 
ing his interest in others, but until the gregarious void 
had been filled, it seemed an intrusion to meet any person 
who removed from him the pure sense of being a mere 
member of the crowd. The thoroughly gregarious person 
is not necessarily sympathetic. One does not wish to be 
in the crowd because he has any sense of personal relation- 
ship with the members individually making up the assem 
blage, but simply because of the pleasure that comes fro: 
the contact itself. 
The loosest possible gregarious association is what migh’ 
be known as a gathering. It requires the fortuitou 
coming together of people, and represents so little commo 
association that it seems to have no individual characte 
at all. It is, however, potentially a crowd and ean eve’ 
quickly become a mob or express itself in a panic. IT 
affords gregarious satisfaction and has become in moder: 
life one of the great pleasures to be found in a city. Peopl 
are drawn together, as for instance in the Easter Sunda; 
parade, without any other motive than the mere enjoy 
ment of contact with a great mass of moving individual: 
The crowd represents a more definite sort of associatio 
In the crowd there is a degree of concentration of atte

SIGNIFICANCE OF GREGARIOUSNESS 137 
tion. A typical crowd, for example, gathers about a 
speaker, and his personality becomes the common element 
shared by all the members of the crowd. The crowd at 
the bulletin board, following the announcement of the 
results of a famous football match or a national election 
or a great battle, shows a fixation of attention which tends 
fo a slight organization of common interest. 
Crowds are proverbially lacking in intelligent behavior. 
Io be sure they are sometimes known to act in a more 
1eroic manner than most of the individuals by themselves 
vould be likely to do. These experiences are, however, 
xceptional. Usually the crowd, whatever its makeup, 
ravels upon a low emotional and intellectual level. This 
s largely the result of lack of discussion. The crowd 
san not tolerate differences of opinion. To permit dis- 
ussion dissolves unity and breaks the crowd into either a 
ere mass of individuals or two mutually contending 
roups. Crowds therefore usually listen only to those who 
epresent the dominating view. They shout down or other- 
ise suppress anyone who has a contrary attitude. The 
lpeakers that satisfy the crowd most are those who by 
mperament and emotional equipment are best able to 
press the crowd’s own reactions. They do not so much 
ominate the crowd, as a rule, as mirror its own feeling. 
Since discussion is impossible, the thinking of the crowd 
forced to keep to the level that enlists the sympathies 
d interests of the great body of those there assembled. 
ecessarily this means catering to the lower levels of intelli- 
mee, and in this fashion the crowd creates the character 
at really brings it into disrepute because of its lack of 
entality. ‘ 
The crowd can easily be exploited. He who can manipu- 
te its emotions may have for a time the advantages of 
e hero. He can bring out the weakest and meanest reac-
-P-A-G-E-150
  138 PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL ADJUSTMENT 
tions of those who are temporarily caught by his magnetism 
or his oratory or his clever way of playing upon their 
feelings. This power, though transitory, is so great, as 
history abundantly demonstrates, as to bring the mass of 
people under the sway of its leader. Having the crowd 
in his hands for the time he is free to turn their hostility 
into the channel that pleases him most. 
The mob is a crowd driven by the pugnacious instinct. 
The gathering can be easily turned into a mob, particularly 
under the sway of oratory. A very interesting incident 
showing the development of a mob recently occurred in 
a settlement in Boston. The people of the neighborhood 
had come together to witness an amateur play. They 
represented largely two groups of European immigrants. 
At the time an election was taking place in Europe, of the 
greatest emotional interest to these American-Europeans. 
To the surprise of the head of the settlement, just before 
the play was to start, the orderly gathering became a fight- 
ing mob, without any knowledge on her part as to what 
started the uprising. The play had to be abandoned and 
the police called. Eventually it was found that the dis- 
turbance had all resulted from a quarrel starting between 
two members of the different groups in their argumen 
concerning European policy. Evidently if the play ha 
started sooner and the attention of the group had been con 
centrated upon it, the mob would not have sprung int 
existence. 
Another demonstration of the way a mob can be create 
is given by McDougall. ‘‘It was my good fortune to wit: 
ness the almost instantaneous spread of anger through 
erowd of five thousand warlike savages in the heart o: 
Borneo. Representatives of all the tribes of a large dis 
- trict of Sarawak had been brought together by the residen 
magistrate for the purpose of strengthening friendly: rela
-P-A-G-E-151
  SIGNIFICANCE OF GREGARIOUSNESS 139 
tions and cementing peace between the various tribes. All 
went smoothly, and the chiefs surrounded by their fol- 
lowers were gathered together in a large hall, rudely con- 
structed of timber, to make public protestations of friend- 
ship. An air of peace and good will pervaded the assembly, 
until a small piece of wood fell from the roof upon the 
head of one of the leading chiefs, making a slight wound 
from which the blood trickled. Only the immediate neigh- 
bors of this chief observed the accident or could perceive 
its effect; nevertheless in the space of a few seconds a 
wave of angry emotion swept over the whole assembly, and 
a general and bloody fight would have at once commenced, 
but that the Resident had insisted upon all weapons being 
left in the boats on the river 200 yards away. The great 
majority of the crowd rushed headlong to fetch their 
weapons from their boats, while the few who remained on 
the ground danced in fury or rushed to and fro gesticulat- 
ing wildly. Happily the boats were widely scattered along 
the banks of the river, so that it was possible for the Resi- 
dent, by means of persuasion, threats, and a show of armed 
foree, to prevent the hostile parties coming together again 
with their weapons in hand.’ 
: e most desperate sort of gregarious reaction is the 
panic. This is the activity of a group of people under 
the sway of fear. All sense of discipline and moral 
responsibility is tossed to the winds. Individuals act con- 
trary to their ordinary behavior, as persons beside them- 
selves. The operations of intelligence are temporarily 
paralyzed; the dictates of prudence are forgotten. Indi- 
viduals as in a frenzy rush hither and thither, doing foolish 
things, and many pay the penalty of their lives for their 
lack of judgment. A panic can be created almost in an 
(1) McDougall, W., The Group Mind, pp. 37-38. 
 
-P-A-G-E-152
140 PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL ADJUSTMENT 
instant under favorable circumstances, as when the crowd 
at the theater hears the ery of fire and a sense of danger 
spreads through the audience. This is particularly apt to 
happen if there has been such an occurrence recently and 
its danger has been suggested by newspaper accounts of 
the former happening. Even disciplined soldiers, once 
they give way to fear, often react with the behavior of 
those dominated by panic. Their habits of self-control 
drilled into them by long effort are thrown aside. 
The panic can be prevented as easily as it can be started. 
Anything that will create in the majority a sense of pru- 
dence and judgment will forbid the outburst of the spirit 
of panic. Exhibitions of courage by outstanding persons 
will sometimes accomplish this. Humor has been known 
not only to prevent the mob, but also the panic. Any 
conscious preparation against panic will tend to prevent 
its occurence. In printing the theater program the state- 
ment of what one should do in case of fire, and the 
description of the exits with the announcement of how 
much time is required to empty the theater tends to 
create the thought of what to do in case of danger, 
and this leads to confidence. Under most circumstances 
it eliminates all danger of panic in the theater. The 
exhibition of intense terror, as when one individual rushes 
from his theater seat to the nearest exit shouting, is the 
most dangerous stimulation. On the other hand the sight 
of an orchestra continuing its music as the smoke pours 
from the stage suppresses tendencies to panic and the audi- 
ence calmly walks out. 
The gregarious tendency shows itself in human conduct 
in all sorts of ways. One of the most important is its 
power to create in us all, in varying degrees, a desire to 
conform to the customary behavior about us. Evidence 
of this appears in the power that the conventional style
-P-A-G-E-153
SIGNIFICANCE OF GREGARIOUSNESS 141 
has to exert its dominance upon people. We dress uncom- 
fortably and often unattractively in order to follow the 
style. We are self-conscious and uneasy if we find our- 
selves wearing what others have ceased to wear, and as 
quickly as possible we change to the new style. A boat- 
load of immigrants are dressed in their Sunday best when 
the boat lands. Soon they find themselves distinguished 
by their variance from American habits of dress and in 
a very few days most of them discard forever the dress 
that has previously been their habit. They imitate as 
closely as possible what seems to be the vogue in the new 
country. 
As we conform in dress, so we try to conform in more 
serious ways. The rapid spread of verbal expressions indi- 
cates the contagion of language, which rests primarily on 
gregarious imitation. Human nature in the same way 
tends to react to gregarious stimulation in opinion and 
belief. .The group-influences that operate to build up 
public opinion attempt to make the fullest possible use of 
this gregarious tendency. This is well seen in the influence 
of newspapers. The newspaper in its origin had a gre- 
garious character and has now developed into the most 
penetrating of all the influences of gregarious life. 
‘As the gregarious tendency elevates uniformity it re- 
presses individuality. It is difficult for one to think his 
own thoughts, do his own ways, form his own judgments, 
if he is susceptible to the influence of the surrounding herd. 
A striking illustration of the painful reactions to intense 
gregarious life by men whose former habits expressed 
greater individuality than that afforded by the new situa- 
tion was seen in the country boy’s experience in the army 
cantonment. Coming as he did from a small country village 
where he had never mingled with a great crowd for any 
length of time, he found himself a mere unit of a great 
 
-P-A-G-E-154
  142 PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL ADJUSTMENT 
assemblage which in every way stimulated and made use 
of gregarious habits.. He was obliged to eat with a great 
-number of people, sleep in large dormitories, drill in com- 
panies and from morning until night he found himself 
under the sway of gregarious conditions. In certain cases 
he found it almost impossible to conform to the new envi- 
ronment. Social workers in the cantonments tell us that 
it was occasionally necessary to provide opportunities for 
these boys to be by themselves for an hour or more every 
day that they might regain a sense of individuality until 
they had become more accustomed to the new conditions. 
Once they had become fully accustomed to the gregarious 
life most of them found it tremendously fascinating, and 
as the social psychologist prophesied, many of them set- 
tled in great cities after the war and found it impossible 
to be happy for any length of time.in the former environ- 
ment of their small village. 
The newspaper reader illustrates the gregarious tendency 
toward lost individuality, for it is a common experience 
to find the reader of the morning paper not only talking 
about a definite event but reacting to it in the way the 
paper suggested and directly opposite to the reactions of 
another group who happened to read a different paper and 
receive a different suggestion. 
A striking reaction in human conduct is the pleasure 
that the gregarious experience gives in its lifting of re- 
sponsibility. Life is so full of repressions, that all of 
us feel to some extent, and some of us a great deal, the 
coercion of social influence. The interest in camping is 
based in part upon the relief that a temporary departure 
from ordinary gregarious influences brings to the modern 
man, and in every way this deserves to be stressed since 
it is one of the ways of getting an antidote for our exces- 
sive gregariousness.
-P-A-G-E-155
SIGNIFICANCE OF GREGARIOUSNESS 143 
To a greater degree, however, the mob offers freedom 
from this sense of responsibility. This must be remem- 
bered in interpreting mob spirit; otherwise one would lose 
all confidence in human nature. It is not pleasant to see 
in a photograph the agreeable emotions expressed upon 
the faces of young men and women gathered about the 
bonfire in which is burning the body of a human being, 
as some of our authentic photographs of American city race 
riots demonstrate. It would seem at first thought as if 
these individuals were desperately cruel and were unlike 
the normal human being. Their reaction however can only 
be understood by remembering that they are at the time 
under the sway of gregarious impulse and are not fully 
conscious of their own reactions. When they awake later 
frum their gregarious debauchery, and with a sense of 
individual responsibility look back upon what they have 
done, their behavior becomes as inexplicable to them as 
it is to us. This is an extreme picture of the utter aban- 
donment of human nature when thoroughly intoxicated 
with gregarious impulses; it certainly represents the herd 
tendency rather than cruelty or vengeance. 
The gregarious tendency also influences conduct by 
developing a sense of importance. One feels power because L 
he is associated with a great multitude, and they are power- 
ful. Without doubt those who suffer from social inferiority 
or who feel their social impotence, whether actual or 
imagined, are especially prone to seek gregarious relation- 
| ships. The member of the party is no longer by himself. 
He is elevated to a sense of importance because everything 
that concerns the party concerns him and its success gives 
him a sense of prestige. Much of the partisanship that 
gathers about modern sport is based upon this sense of 
prestige through the identification of the spectator with 
his team so that vicariously he obtains success in its success
-P-A-G-E-156
  144. PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL ADJUSTMENT 
and suffers defeat in its failure. Doubtless this gregarious 
tendency in sport is a safety valve in modern life to a 
considerable extent and softens the distinctions and differ- 
ences that are separating influences. The athletic game 
cuts through all levels of society and brings an emotional 
comradeship that could be produced in no other way, and 
to a large degree lessens the antagonisms of everyday life. 
—_( Much of the influence of advertising is gregarious in 
origin. We like to have what others have, go where others 
go, and the writer of the advertisement plays this tendency 
of ours to the utmost. The clerk often says, ‘‘This is what 
everybody is getting,’’ confident that he has given us the 
strongest motive possible for buying. In this way modern 
advertising caters to uniformity and by appealing to gre- 
garious desires creates discontent among those who can 
not have what others have. Even the automobile is pur- 
chased by some who do not care so much for the thing 
itself as they suppose, but who enormously enjoy the satis- 
faction of having what their neighbors and associates have. 
One of the most significant of all the influences of gre- 
gariousness in modern life is the universal tendency in 
civilized lands for people to leave the rural environment 
and settle in cities. To be sure, this movement is not 
entirely a gregarious one. Economie interest has a large 
part in this drift, but it is by no means altogether economic. 
Everywhere the influence of gregarious conditions is popu- 
larized and the natural instinct to be with others is intensi- 
fied. The city newspaper, read far out in the country, 
gives country people often more knowledge of urban life 
than of the social experience of their own settlement. The 
pleasures of the gregarious experience are sometimes made

ronment of the country home seems tame. Specific expe-

men and women who in a short time have become so sat- 
isfied with herd life that they have not been able to enjoy 
a visit to their former home for more than a few days 
even though they have had a genuine love for their parents 
and a keen interest in their former associates. 
Travel has become so easy that habits that tend to tie 
one in the rural environment are either easily broken or 
not at all formed. At the same time the city reaches out 
and brings its appeal to the young men and women a hun- 
dred miles away in the open country. It is not strange 
that as a result of this, people everywhere are on the move 
from the countryside to the city. Persons of influence 
who work in the country, such as the teacher or minister 
or doctor are often themselves captivated by the urban 
life and act as missionaries teaching those who come under 
their influence the desirability of migrating from country 
to city. 
Even the government finds itself catering to the gre- 
garious cravings. Great spectacles, celebrations, reviews, 
are instituted largely that people may be given the gre- 
garious satisfactions they desire, even though there is little 
utility as the result of the expenditure of considerable time 
and money. The increase in holidays is evidence of the 
desire of city people to have opportunity for a more intensi- 
fied gregarious satisfaction than the ordinary day provides. 
It is interesting in this connection to notice that most of 
the suggestions for the addition of more holidays come 
from city people, whether expressed in the legislature or 
the newspaper. 
The most unfortunate result of gregariousness in present 
social life is the great confidence of people in what may 
well be called class thinking. The confidence that people 
have in ideas that are widespread reminds one of both 
superstition and day-dreaming. They believe that what
-P-A-G-E-158
  146 PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL ADJUSTMENT 
everybody assents to must be so true as to forbid any 
investigation, The most obnoxious traditions and unprofit- 
able processes of social reaction can be largely established 
by general assent. Thus we have illustrations of the sinis- 
ter effect of group suggestion which may be cunningly 
operated by some one or some group or some organization 
that is anxious to exploit human weakness for selfish 
purposes. 
Mass thinking also resembles day-dreaming in that it has 
in it an optimism which seems to build upon the idea that 
what many want to have true must become true. Mean- 
while the actual conditions prevail without regard to the 
multitude who hold some definite opinion at variance with 
the facts. Causes move irresistibly onward and the social 
organism is led into painful experience as a child lacking 
judgment walks into danger, happy until the moment of 
pain arises. The most risky element in human society is the 
present tyranny of mass thinking. Ideas that the many 
have they wish to keep with a stubbornness which is posi- 
tively inimical to their own welfare. Necessarily they 
hound the innovator and stone the prophet and as a con- 
sequence suffer delay in their normal progress. 
~The best antidote for gregarious mass thinking is edu- 
eation. Any development of intelligence tends to weaken 
excessive submission to social group coercion. This fact 
shows itself in every form of behavior. Not only are the 
intelligent persons most likely to: form individual judg- 
ments regarding political, economic and religious interests, 
but it is also true that trained people are less likely to_ 
join the mob or come under the sway of panic. The trained 
individual has inner life that makes it unnecessary for 
him to depend so much upon outward circumstances. The 
truer the education, the richer his resources and the less 
dependent he is upon external stimulations. The indi-
-P-A-G-E-159

vidual variation is of course great, but of all the possible 
influences none can modify submission to gregarious pres- 
sure as can education. This is very fortunate because it 
discloses the only pathway which leads to democratic 
security. An uneducated democracy is bound to suffer 
from suggestion and mass thinking; a democracy with a 
trained citizenship affords the most promising opportunity 
for rational adjustment in political and economic expe- 
rience. The schools are the bulwark against menacing gre- 
gariousness in its myriad forms. 
Egoism, in whatever expression it takes, antagonizes gre- 
garious dominance except in those cases where one sufter- 
ing from social inferiority obtains his prestige by member- 
ship in some organization. Egoism, however, tends to anti- 
social attitudes and wins its freedom from gregariousness 
by separation. Education leaves one sensitive to the life 
of his fellows but independent from their suggestion. He 
does not cut away his sympathy; he simply maintains his 
individuality. 
“Gregariousness shows itself in every type of educational 
etivity. The child enjoys school in part always because 
e is a gregarious animal and loves the association that 
he schoolroom furnishes. All the vexing problems of mass 
hinking, mob spirit, and even panic, are possible expe- 
iences at school. The law forces the training of the chil- 
ren as a needed protection against panic in case of fire 
nd other menacing circumstances. 
f{ the schools are to fulfill their social function, attention 
ust be directed, from the earliest grades through the 
igh school, to the building up of a prophylactic against 
ass judgments and social suggestion. The teacher needs, 
specially in such courses as history and civies, to bring 
ut clearly to the student the importance of reasoned 
pinion and individual responsibility. Unless stress is

placed upon the developing of these qualities the contribu 
tion that education furnishes to national security mus 
be less than it ought to be. In the teaching process th 
teacher should demand personal reactions and encourag 
any original judgment. In this way the child gets th 
habit of thinking for himself. It behooves the paren 
even more than the teacher to stress personal response a: 
contrasted with subservience to the group. 
Parents often make use of group opinion to force th 
child to behavior which is far less advantageous to th 
child than the slight variations he spontaneously assumes 
Parents would not urge the children to trivial uniformity 
by saying, ‘‘This is what all the childven do,” or ‘Thi 
is what all the children wear,’’ if it were clearly under 
stood that this very argument is leading the child to dis 
count his own individuality and to react more constantly 
in harmony with outside suggestion.A’strong personality 
must have a degree of freedom from group coercion. The 
home most of all can provide this opportunity and only sc 
can the developing personality receive the preparation tha’ 
is demanded in these days of organized propaganda an 
persistent social agitation.

  CHAPTER X 
> Tue INsTINcT OF SELF-ASSERTION 
“Human impulses, hereditary in origin, consolidate into 
habits that may be defined and classified with reference to 
their social significance. These consolidations” represent 
instinct in the narrow sense, emotion, and habit. They are 
called instinets, urges, and pattern-reactions. It is impor- 
tant that any definition make clear the fact that they are 
products of social influences that have tended to check, 
modify, suppress, stimulate and encourage impulsive ten- 
dencies. They contain two elements, feeling-attitudes and 
drives toward action. Psychology for purposes of analysis 
has defined the first as emotion, the second as instinct. 
The sociologist finds these consolidations or organized im- 
pulsive activities indispensable for the understanding of 
human behavior. They permit him to catalog the funda- 
mental social modes of behavior from the viewpoint of 
the interests or purposes that distinguish the groups of 
habit-reactions. 
Among such urges or consolidations is that of self-asser- 
tion. By general speech designated as a major human 
instinet,® self-assertion represents a social classification of 
various types of self-regarding response. Indeed the term 
might be made to include in a wide sense all purposeful 
activities since all of them are attempts to advance the 
welfare of the self. Self-preservation or self-assertion, 
owever, as the term is commonly used denotes an activity

that brings near to the center of consciousness self-regard- 
ing attitudes. The individual feels the urge to express his 
will, to maintain his position, to protect his reputation m 
the presence of others. Although self-assertion emphasizes 
the individual, it nevertheless requires a social background. 
The group-life gives self-assertion its possibility of ex- 
pression. 
The consolidated urge of self-assertion shows itself in 
various forms. We have, for example, positive and nega- 
tive self-assertion) Each attempts to win attention for 
the individual, but the first is aggressive and the second 
assumes the role of meekness or self-abasement. An one, the 
individual expects to force himself upon the’ attention of 
his associates; in the other, he hopes to get the attention 
by winsome subserviency. 
Any interpretation of social behavior nore, stresses 
self-assertion. Not only do we trace much of the momen- 
tum of human activity to self-assertion as a source but 
we also find that we can catalog the results of behavior in 
terms of self-assertive satisfactions. Psychiatrists who have 
had to deal with practical, concrete difficulties of human be- 
havior, due to serious mental abnormality, have come to 
recognize the unwholesome possibilities of self-assertion. 
Unreasonable strivings to advance the self have been given 
the designation ‘‘will-to-power’’ cravings. Alfred Adler,™ 
an Austrian psychiatrist, has made much of the egoistic 
eravings as causes of psychopathic disorders; and as a 
result of his writings, self-assertion, as expressed in will-to- 
power cravings, has come to have a new and deeper signi- 
ficance for the sociologist. 
The material that interprets human self-assertion, as 
in the case of the other pattern-reactions, must be gathered 
(1) Adler, A., The Neurotic Constitution.
-P-A-G-E-165
  THE INSTINCT OF SELF-ASSERTION 153 
from the everyday life of people. Human nature does not 
express itself instinctively in the sense that animal nature , 
is the product of instincts. Man ceases to have the original, 
automatic, unmodified instinctive responses in his ordinary 
life long before maturing consciousness carries forward the 
memory of his experiences. It is the sociological product 
built through processes of habit-construction upon the orig- 
inal hereditary basis that concerns us. Important as is 
the study of animal psychology, it is not the study of 
human mental experience, and it is necessary to distin- 
cuish this fact in any interpretation of man’s instinctive 
behavior. So long as we deal with animal reactions we 
are not handting the material that is characteristie of 
man. The reactions that originate in human contacts 
interest us for they may furnish the material that gives 
s insight into the social conduct of humans. When man 
eveloped to the point of having a self-conscious person- 
lity, a new element, not found even in the higher animals, 
ntered; and if the meaning of this is neglected the full 
significance of man’s social life is lost. Man is not a mere 
ocialized animal. He does not meet his social necessities 
y automatic reactions of a purely instinctive type. There 
s a qualitative difference due to the new element, per- 
onality. 
In discussing human conduct it is imperative that we 
otice how the social situation, the influence of association, 
auses the difficulties that we charge up to self-assertion. 
he impulse by itself, unrelated to the social environment, 
ould cause no one difficulty. We would simply respond 
our environment in a definite way and our activity,

according to circumstances, would be wise or foolish; and 
its consequences, good or bad, would soon show themselves. 
The human situation is not at all like that. The influences 
that operate upon impulsive tendencies for the purpose 
of social control make the difference. It is the sociological 
element that creates the problem. 
In our social contacts we are ever experiencing inner 
desires regarding ourselves that are essentially composed of 
self-regarding attitudes. We have a goal for the self, an 
accomplishment in terms of personal attainment, which 
provides the object and the vitality of our effort in a 
given undertaking. In the words of James, we are working 
toward a definite type of ‘‘me,’’ a certain experience for the 
self. We picture ourselves as having certain satisfactions, 
as arriving at a selected position. These self-regarding 
urges or strivings come out very clearly and commonly in 
our day-dreaming, also in our night dreams and in our 
conversation. The adolescent day-dreams of himself as 
the hero of a conflagration, when he alone keeps his head 
and runs enormous risk to save the lives and property of 
his friends and even of his enemies. This dream leads 
deliciously to the climax, when he is heaped with adula- 
tion. With slight variations he may repeat this, or a 
different type of day-dream, during a period of many 
months. 
The young man dreams, while sleeping, that the more 
advanced position for which he has daily been striving in| 
his actual work is offered him at a salary twenty-five per 
cent larger than he had understood to be attached to it, 
After accepting it, he finds that the manager who mad! 
the offer was frantic in his eagerness to secure the service: 
of so valuable a man, and had suffered agonies of suspens' 
until the contract was signed. When he awakes, the youn; 
man is a bit dazed to find that the offer his sleeping sel:
-P-A-G-E-167
  
THE INSTINCT OF SELF-ASSERTION (68) 
so calmly accepted was not for a five thousand dollar job, 
but for a fifty thousand dollar one. He remembers noting 
when he signed the dream-contract that the salary was 
identical with that of the President of the United States, 
as reported on the big Miscellaneous Chart that stood near 
the teacher’s desk in the little district school of his country- 
bred days. In the dream fifty thousand dollars made no 
more impression than five thousand dollars, now he is 
awake. 
In conversation with an acquaintance whom she con- 
siders financially better off than herself, a matron says 
sweetly, ‘‘You have such an attractive little house.’? In 
a flash she remembers that this was the one point of 
superiority she had been able to establish in her own mind, 
in reviewing their comparative situations. But that she 
should have said it thus bluntly, her own larger house 
in view at the moment—she marks herself down as idiotic, 
but never fails to feel a little thrill of warm delight in 
regretting the inadvertent word. : 
We are forever struggling for this, for that, for some- 
thing else, when our underlying desire is to make of our- 
selves something corresponding to our ideal. The goal we 
set for ourselves in a definite enterprise may be good; it 
may be socially bad. For us, in any case, it is desirable. 
Therefore it drives us toward action. 
elf-assertion as it shows itself from time to time in the 
conduct of an individual is the result of early training, 
personal experience, education and suggestion operating 
upon the basic material of the instinct. In one’s self-asser- ° 
tive behavior may be seen all the results of contact, direct 
and indirect, which has had a modifying effect upon the 
original impulses. The result is that the individual gets 
so far away from the instinct itself that he does not realize 
that behind the ambition upon whi¢h his attention is 
/     
                
   /
-P-A-G-E-168
156 PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL ADJUSTMENT 
focused is the momentum of a powerful instinctive craving. 
If the meaning of the struggle could be brought into con- 
sciousness, the fundamental source of desire recognized as 
self-preservation, then the individual would not so deeply 
suffer when he fails to accomplish the ends for which he 
strives. 
What are the egoistic desires that are common in human 
conduct? They have been defined by Professor Thomas. 
\ First is the desire for security. Under social stimulus this 
desire has been widened until it contains a great amount 
of self-assertion. In our usual experiences we have little 
thought of physical peril. Our danger takes on social form. 
We desire security in our associations. We want to hold 
our present reputation or to advance it. We covet more 
popularity. We crave a larger sense of power. We hope 
to lift our family to a higher standard of life. Our security 
has to do with a multitude of interests. These interests 
are in turn reactions from our social contacts. Our desire 
for security may run ahead into the third and fourth gen- 
eration and involve accumulation of property and the 
process and certainty of transmitting it. We may seek 
to advance in our profession, to extend our business; or 
our urge for security may exhaust itself in our effort to 
keep our job. For many in industry certainty of employ- 
ment is the most persistent form of the desire for security. 
Recognition is the second egoistic, self-assertive desire. 
It is at times difficult to distinguish this from the wish 
for security. Desire for recognition makes us try to make 
an impression upon our associates. Fashion gets its vital- 
ity from this craving for recognition. In dress, in house- 
furnishings, style of automobile, even in the type of our 
reading, the content of our small talk, we want to make 
the people in our own group catch their breath and com- 
ment inwardly, ‘‘He is up-to-the-minute—perhaps just a
-P-A-G-E-169
  THE INSTINCT OF SELF-ASSERTION 157 
shade ahead of it.’’ For most of us this becomes a defen- 
sive contest, in which we try not to become conspicuously 
unfashionable. This is true of those who scorn the tyranny 
of fashion as well as of those who are hopeless of meeting 
its demands. 
Much of the competition and rivalry of modern life has 
for its purpose social recognition. The doctor desires to 
make a name for himself. The student works for the prize, 
the honors, the degree, not because of any sense of their 
utility but because from them he expects social recognition. 
Some work for fame, deceiving themselves into supposing 
that they will be long remembered. We realize, however, 
in our sane moments, that we cannot expect to be remem- 
bered for any great length of time. Nevertheless, the cray- 
ing, driven by the deep-seated impulse for recognition, 
intrudes upon our consciousness and shows itself in our 
reveries. We wish to be remembered. We imagine our- 
selves remembered. We act in the spirit of one who 
expects to be remembered. Gifts are made, monuments 
built, organizations established as a result of this tremend- 
lous craving for remembrance. The impulse vitalizes our 
belief in immortality. It provides a motive for our ethical 
control. We avoid the tempting evil choice from our real- 
ization that it is out of harmony with the reputation we 
desire to establish for ourselves and by which we wish to 
ibe remembered. . 
Another striving that comes from the egoistic tendency 
is the desire for intimate response. Anyone that watches 
he very little child as he develops soon notices how early 
e takes great delight in having from his mother expe- 
iences of intimate response. Indeed the pleasureableness 
f these early experiences frequently becomes an obstacle to 
motional maturity. One wishes from the parent the same 
reatment he received as a child. This craving for inti-      
        
         
      
   
-P-A-G-E-170
  158 PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL ADJUSTMENT 
mate response is one of the profoundest of human expe- 
riences. It certainly forms a part of the love experience 
which we usually ascribe to sex attraction. Literature teems 
with this motive of conduct. The craving for intimate 
association, closest possible comradeship, has never been 
more beautifully expressed than by Alfred Tennyson in 
“In Memoriam.’’ For example: 
“Dark house, by which once more I stand 
Here in the long unlovely street, 
Doors, where my ‘heart was used to beat 
So quickly, waiting for a hand, 
A hand that can be clasp’d no more— 
Behold me, for I cannot sleep, 
And like a guilty thing I creep 
At earliest morning to the door. 
He is not here; but far away 
The noise of life begins again, 
And ghastly thro’ the drizzling rain 
On the bald street breaks the blank day.” 
“For this alone on Death I wreak 
The wrath that garners in my heart; 
He put our lives so far apart 
We cannot hear each other speak.” 
“Far off thou art, but ever nigh; 
I have thee still, and I rejoice; 
I prosper, circled with thy voice; 
I shall not lose thee tho’ I die.” 
As in the other expressions of self-assertion the craving 
for intimate response from some other human being usually 
takes a definite, concrete form and we feel that by attain-
-P-A-G-E-171
THE INSTINCT OF SELF-ASSERTION 159 
ing a specific relationship we shall “be satisfied. Expe- 
rience, however, teaches us our mistake and we attempt to 
discover some new association that will completely satisfy. 
Behind every adventure into the realm of friendship is 
the instinctive urge itself that cannot be contented with 
any relationship, however close and beautiful. Doubtless 
this explains some of the marriage failures. Disillusion- 
ment becomes disappointment. Excessive demands are 
made of the marriage relation and bitterness follows the 
ereeping in of even the slightest disillusionment. The 
mother expects to find in her first born a perfect response 
of intimate love. Later she learns that she must release 
the child somewhat from such an ideal association or she 
prevents his maturity. Thus we are driven by self-asser- 
tion to seek from friend, lover or child a full response 
in our endeavor to express our self-cravings. There is 
a common loneliness, felt most by the finer types of per- 
sonality, that Frederick Robertson has made the theme of 
his ‘‘Illusiveness of Life.’’ 
Without question the psychiatrist, especially the psycho- 
analyst, ministers often to this well-nigh universal desire 
to enjoy a complete, confidential relationship with another 
human being that will permit, without any attempt at 
control or scrutiny, a pouring out of the inmost feelings 
and thoughts of one’s deepest self. Providing an oppor- 
tunity for an unburdening of this sort is naturally he’pful 
for one who is suffering from repression, pent-up fears and 
a sense of social isolation. Charles Darwin tells us that 
his father discovered in his medical practice that what 
some of his patients desired was not medicine but an 
opportunity for a confidential talk regarding their own 
problems. ‘‘His father was a man of unusual insight into 
human nature, for he practiced the present psychoanalytic 
principle of inducing an effective catharsis and readjust- 
 
-P-A-G-E-172
160 PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL ADJUSTMENT 
ment in his patients as a method of treating the distress 
caused by affective suppression—anxiety.’’ Ministers 
and priests also have always ministered to this desire for 
intimate association and it has been one of the ways in 
which they have been most useful. 
Finally we have the egoistic striving for social experience. 
We wish to push our self-life beyond its usual frontier. 
We seek the zest of tackling something new and different. 
We covet an opportunity to try our resources, to demon- 
strate ourselves, to advertise our possibilities, in some novel, 
and perhaps to our friends unexpected, form of behavior. 
It is self-preservation aggressively expressing itself. We 
enlarge our life by extending it. Especially do those who 
are suffering disappointment or discontent desire the novel 
experience. Monotonous life, whether due to ennui or the 
pressure of irksome toil, leads to the craving for some- 
thing new and different, some experience as yet untasted. 
Day-dreaming clothes these desires for adventurous expe- 
rience with the garments of fancy. Story-writing caters 
to it, as one may easily discover if he investigates the 
reading of those who lead pent-up lives. 
In all these strivings there is abundant opportunity for 
emotional conflict. For example, how easily one may feel 
that in some position that means much to him he is slip- 
ping from his former security. The desire for recogni- 
tion may become more intense as it wins success. The 
emotions of ordinary friendly contacts may stir deep emo- 
tional resentment. New experience may merely sharpen 
the appetite for still more. Like the lover of travel one 
may go from experience to experience, ever seeking and 
never fully satisfied. 
Viewed from the sociological level these conflicts result 
from the difficulty of bringing into sensible balance the   
(1) Kempf, E. J., Psychopathology, pp. 210-11.
-P-A-G-E-173
  
THE INSTINCT OF SELF-ASSERTION 161 
strivings and the equipment of the person. By equipment 
is meant not merely the original capacity, but in addition 
all the circumstances of the person’s life that hamper or 
advance his aspirations. Lumped together, all the re- 
sources of the individual represent the opportunity he has 
for self-expression. They are his equipment as he faces 
his environment and attempts self-assertion. 
~@ur task is to find and keep a normal balance between 
equipment and self-assertion, the two elements that pro- 
duce our changing self-esteem. For, as James has said, 
in the equation 
Success Self-esteem +=———. ci Pretensions 
we can increase the fraction by diminishing the denomin- 
ator as well as by increasing the numerator. If we had 
a normal balance between resources and ambition we 
would strive for what was attainable and we would trust 
instinct as does the animal. But our social experience 
has more to do with our strivings than do the objective 
facts as to the degree of hope we really have in our self- 
seeking. Intense strivings, as in the case of neurotics, may 
accompany limited resources and the person may be driven 
forth to battle without the slightest hope of victory. In 
eases such as these there is need of a reasonable expecta- 
tion on the part of the patient, but of course this just 
program for life is the very thing that the sufferer resents 
and sets himself against. The result is that he lashes 
himself with the whip of his own ambitions and fails at 
times, as a consequence, even in the doing of those things 
for which he is properly equipped, 
Not in the sanest life is there any hope of one final 
adjustment between desire and attainment. We cannot 
be guaranteed for a period of time like expensive watches 
and clocks. Our equipment is in constant flux. It ebbs

and flows like the tides. If we have more we must expect 
of ourselves more success. If we are less in energy in 
comparison with a period when we had fewer competitors, 
if we are mentally stiffer from mere growth in age, what- 
ever the facts that decrease our resources, we must demand 
less of ourselves than formerly. If, on the other hand, 
we have multiplied our earlier personal capital, then our 
operations should proportionately advance. In a matter 
that calls for such delicacy of judgment, such changing 
adaptations to external fact, such putting aside of one’s 
own bias and the false counsel of tender-hearted friends, 
it is small wonder that many there are that find a sane 
ordering of ambition a hopeless task. There is risk in 
expecting too much of ourselves. There is danger and 
reproach in not demanding enough. Somewhere is the 
golden mean. To help us find it is the business of education.

  CHAPTER XI 
Tue Soctan SIGNIFICANCE OF SELF-ASSERTION 
ee Self-assertion expresses itself constantly in social behav 
ior. Motives that control social conduct are largely roote 
in this self-regarding instinct. The desire for superiority 
the various forms of rivalry, are of course, expressions 0 
self. assertion. 
~ It is well for us to recognize the opportunity the crow 
provides for self-assertion. Feelings of inferiority ma 
be forgotten or overcome by one who joins in the mo 
Just as the family life opens up opportunities for tho 
who outside the home feel themselves cowed by cire 
stances, so the mob gives to some an opportunity, throu; 
their association with the others, to develop a sense 
power. The individual feels himself elevated, magnifie 
given unusual and perhaps unexpected power from t 
fact that he enters into a relationship which in contra: 
with his ordinary experiences affords a tremendous amow 
of satisfaction. The fact that he as an individual coun 
for so little passes out of his consciousness and in its pla 
comes the sense of importance and power that feeds 
vanity and relieves his long pent-up and irritated se! 
assertion. Since the crowd experience is increasingly p: 
valent and characteristic of urban life, and since the cro 
so easily becomes the mob, self-assertion, unless other ¢ 
rective influences are brought into play, more and m 
will express itself in the socially dangerous mob-spirit. T’ 
mob-type of thinking and feeling, with its stress upon w! 
formity and solidarity, will have a tendency to win t| 
sympathies of those who are lacking in individual e

fidence and therefore are sensitive to the joys of gregari- 
ous contacts and like-mindedness. 
——An interesting illustration of a social expression of self- 
assertion is the almost universal love of membership in 
secret organizations. In the savage secret society as in the 
Greek letter society of the American college we find the 
motives of membership mostly rooted in self-assertion. In 
college, for example, the ‘‘making of a society’’ has so large 
a value that students have left an institution because their 
lack of social popularity has forbidden them the distinc- 
tion of membership, even though it is common knowledge 
that the membership itself is usually of little practical 
importance. As modern life becomes more coercive and 
self-esteem is more hampered by the impersonal relation- 
ships of complex urban life, there must be an increasing 
tendency to find in secret societies a means of insuring a 
degree of self-esteem. 
It is especially interesting to notice the large place that 
the secret society has in the life of the southern negro. 
Conscious of feelings of social inferiority, the negro instine- 
tively turns to the secret organization for prestige. To a 
esser extent the same means of gratifying self-assertion is 
ound in the behavior of the northern negro. Speaking 
lof the southern negro, Odum says: ‘‘Perhaps no phase of 
egro life is so characteristic of the race and has developed 
0 rapidly as that which centers around the secret societies 
nd fraternal orders. In the chapter which follows the 
ffort is made to present a general view rather than ex- 
austive details, many of which it is not possible to obtain. 
‘the facts here presented) are representative and typical; 
hey combine the essentials that are embodied in the fra- 
ernal organization as a social factor among the negroes, 
nd indicate the position it holds in the Negro’s estima- 
ion. This phase of negro life has grown to such an extent

that in any study of the negro community it must be 
ranked as an influence with the home, the school, and the 
church. Indeed it has become an institution and at times 
is ranked by the negroes above the other institutions, in 
part combining these with business and personal interests. 
The business of the fraternal orders is ranked along with 
the trades and commercial interests; they are given a prom- 
inent place on the program of the business leagues. The 
success of such organizations is rated with pride as a 
distinct business achievement. Church members often 
leave the church for the lodge; business hours are arranged 
to meet its demands, and school is dismissed that the chil- 
dren may attend the meeting of the juveniles. The negro 
esteems a prominent official place in his lodge a greater 
honor than a position of trust in his work. Managed by 
members of his own race, the lodge offers the negro a place 
wherein to identify his interests with those of his own 
people; even more than the church, it is an institution 
that appeals to him as his own. It thus satisfies a natural 
social want.’ 
**A single town having not more than five hundred 
colored inhabitants not infrequently has from fifteen to 
twenty subordinate lodges, each representing a different 
order. Many negroes belong to from three to five each, and 
the majority (of the regular lodge patrons and enthusiasts) 
belong to more than one. Indeed it is a source of great 
pride to be able to hold office in more than a single order, 
but as a rule every negro has a favorite one to which he} 
is most loyal; this may be changeable, differing from yea' 
to year.?? j

be compensated by commitment to mob behavior. A stu- 
dent who almost never did any work in spoken form in 
her classes was always a puzzle to one instructor who was 
a friend of her parents. He was particularly anxious to 
help the girl develop her personality, but was unable to 
get her to take any considerable part in class recitations. 
She made up for that by her written work, but was the 
quietest student, and the one most lacking in confidence 
in all her classes. One day when she was a senior, the 
interested instructor found her taking charge of a certain 
mild type of hazing in the college. He watched her and 
found that she was the most aggressive of all the seniors 
in inflicting upon the poor freshmen the trivial and more 
or less foolish regulations that had become a tradition at 
that college. By herself she was nothing; she counted as 
nothing in the college life, but because of her mere mem- 
bership in the class she had finally arrived at a place where 
she was permitted to exercise authority. To her this was 
such a delightful experience that she went far beyond any- 
body else in exercising it. 
In Tom Brown’s School Days, Hughes has used the 
character of Flashman to bring out a reaction familiar to 
all who have had charge of the discipline of youth. The 
boy who was lacking in stamina and could not equally com- 
pete with his fellows became the bully. Tom and his friend 
attempting to rebel against the perpetual bullying of 
Flashman are told by an older boy of a former successful 
insurrection against similar oppression. 
*<¢Was Flashman here then?’ ‘Yes! and a dirty little 
snivelling, sneaking fellow he was too. He never dared to 
join us, and used to toady the bullies by offering to fag 
or them, and peaching against the rest of us.’ ’’ 
The boy who leads in the hazing is likely to have in 
he ordinary life of the college little reputation or follow- 
 
-P-A-G-E-180
  168 PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL ADJUSTMENT 
ing. Indeed, the mob is generally led by those previously 
unfamiliar with power, and its danger is always increased 
by this fact. The person who first tastes the joys of great 
power, and who perhaps has felt deeply an irritating 
social subordination, must be expected to use his opportun- 
ity to drain himself of his former sense of unimportance. 
The mob leader therefore will always tend to use power 
for an intense subjective satisfaction even when the mob 
might accomplish all its purposes with a milder form of 
behavior. 
The feeling of coercion and dissatisfaction generally felt 
today by the workers in industry, without regard to its 
justification, creates an emotional foundation upon which 
in the conditions of city life mob spirit can easily be 
built. The deeper meaning of strikes will not be found by 
one who ignores the satisfaction the worker gets by feeling 
his power as one of a great mass solidified into agreement 
by intense emotional reactions. So long as society with- 
holds social esteem from a great multitude of workers, by 
a traditional disregard of the social significance of produc- 
tive toil, an emotional tension, a self-assertive strain, is 
imposed that creates the conditions for restlessness, mob- 
mindedness and in its extreme expression, for revolution. 
So long as the working man feels that he is put into an 
inferior position, nothing that is done for him in the 
way of wages or leisure or even management, unless it 
takes away this feeling of inferiority, will give him in 
any degree contentment. He will become rather more 
discontented as his leisure is increased, for the more he 
has, the more he will claim social esteem; and so he 
will naturally struggle increasingly for expressions of his 
power, and will always find the strike emotionally more 
satisfying than any compromising agreement, even though 
the latter may be to his advantage. He will, therefore,
-P-A-G-E-181
SIGNIFICANCE OF SELF-ASSERTION 169 
trike against his own interests; he will strike some- 
imes when he can without striking get the thing for which 
1e strikes; he will strike for very trivial reasons, for 
he fundamental craving of his life is not wages, but social 
ecognition. 
The effect of changing from a position of social inferior- 
ty to a sense of ambition and power is interestingly 
‘eported by Place, an accurate observer of conditions 
mong the English working classes following the Indus- 
rial Revolution. He writes with reference to the changes 
produced in the people of Lancashire by the Reform Agita- 
ion: ‘‘One of its effects has been almost, if not entirely, 
werlooked...... It is that in spite of the demoralizing 
nfluence of many of our laws, and the operation of the 
00r-laws, it has impressed the morals and manners, and 
levated the character of the working man. I speak from 
ybservation made on thousands of them, and I hold up 
his fact as enough of itself to satisfy any man not wholly 
enorant of human nature as a very portentous circum- 
tance. Look even to Lancashire. Within a few years a 
tranger walking through their towns was ‘touted,’ 4. e. 
ooted, and an ‘outcomling’ was sometimes pelted with 
tones. ‘Lancashire brute’ was the common and appropri- 
te appellation. Until very lately it would have been dan- 
erous to have assembled 500 of them on any occasion. 
3akers and butchers would at the least have been plun- 
ered. Now 100,000 people may be collected together and 
o riot ensue, and why? Why, but for the fact before 
ated, that the people have an object, the pursuit of which 
ives them importance in their own eyes, elevates them in 
eir own opinion, and thus it is that the very individuals 
ho would have been the leaders of the riot are the keepers 
the peace. In every place as reform has advanced, 
runkenness has retreated, and you may assume that a 
 
-P-A-G-E-182
  170 PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL ADJUSTMENT 
cause which can operate so powerfully as to produce such 
a change, is capable of producing almost anything.’’ 
It is interesting from the viewpoint of self-assertion to 
analyze the revivals that formerly were so characteristic 
of American life. The coming of the evangelist offered 
to a large number of persons formerly with no social 
standing in the community, drunkards and such, a remark- 
able chance to redeem their self-esteem and by an easy 
process of alliance to be lifted to a position of distinction, 
perhaps influence. They became for a time a sort of com- 
munity heroes, praised and made much of by the more 
reputable people of the community. It was certainly a 
dramatic and enormously gratifying reversal of fortune 
It was not strange under such circumstances that there 
ensued a disposition on the part of the convert to continue 
to rehearse his former evil doings and to emphasize his 
earlier reputation since it magnified by contrast his new 
standing and strengthened his sense of his lately acquired 
self-importance. 
Of late historical research has begun to appreciate the 
significance of the inferiority complex as it appears in 
revolution. The subjective element in agitation and politi- 
eal upheavals is greater than writers of the past have 
understood. As has been stated, the step between the role 
of the successful revolutionist and that of the futile vision 
ary is short indeed. 
““‘The genuine statesman will study his problems in ¢ 
rational way, and will suggest a solution that fits the facts 
The neurotic refuses to face the facts. Instead, he beats 
a retreat into his self-created world of ideas, all the tim¢ 
insisting that he is dealing with objective conditions. I 
he is able to convince enough of his contemporaries tha

SIGNIFICANCE OF SELF-ASSERTION we 
his world is the real one, he is hailed as a hero; if he fails 
so to convince them, he is treated as a harmless visionary, 
a mere radical dreamer. In temperament, in psychological 
make-up, and in potentiality, there is no great difference 
between the successful revolutionist and the harmless vis- 
jionary. They both need attention. Which one a given 
individual may become depends in part upon circum- 
stanees, and in part upon his own complexes. If these 
complexes happen to harmonize, as it were, with the envi- 
ronment, then the dreamer is likely to become the revo- 
lutionist.’’™ 
_— A revolution offers the largest possible escape from feel- 
ings of social inferiority that can be had by any human 
experience. It generally reverses the social situation. It 
puts into power those that have felt inferior, and takes 
people from their place of power and puts them into an 
established state of inequality. Nor can one understand 
the brutalities of revolution unless this fact is kept in mind. 
In reading, for instance, what happened to the late Rus- 
sian Czar and his family, everyone, surely, wonders how 
it came about. It seems such cruel folly. It will always 
be such .a burden to the persons that were responsible. 
For six months the former royal family of Russia was 
subjected to unspeakably brutal treatment. Why did the 
people responsible allow that to happen? The Czar was 
helpless. It was for no personal advantage to those con- 
cerned. The bodies of the dead were not even robbed; 
and this has made it possible for us to know the fate of 
these unfortunate people. The cruelty shown this helpless 
family was merely the final climax of an emotional atti- 
tude. It was a wonderfully dramatic expression of the 
power of the craving for social reversal by those who had

tasted power in contrast with former social inferiority. 
Here were the rulers who were most responsible, sup- 
posedly, in the minds of the revolutionists for the coercion 
of the past. ‘‘Now, let them have their own medicine; 
let them drink deeply of the thing that we have been drink- 
ing of,’’ would be the arguments, and then, after the rulers 
had been made to go through the ordeal the very persons 
responsible for it would probably greatly regret their 
brutality. 
—For pathological expressions of self-assertion, however, 
persons suffering from mental diseases are the most repre- 
sentative. The most striking social expression of the 
neurosis is its usual intense selfishness. Dr. Boris Sidis,” 
after long study of the psychopathic patient, declares that 
the one outstanding, characteristic symptom of the psy- 
chopath is his extreme selfishness. There is no greater 
egotism, he affirms, than that of the individual suffering 
from psychopathic disorders. His attention is ever upon 
himself. He is ready at any time to sacrifice his best 
friend or dearest relative if as a result he can add to his 
comfort or pleasure. The fate of a nation means nothing 
in comparison to personal satisfaction. Every unit is 
measured by its value to the egoism of the patient. All 
other considerations are ignored, if in any way health or 
personal interest may be advanced. His mind is always 
occupied with his own purposes and desires, for ‘‘every 
psychopathic case is essentially egoistic.’’ 
_-No tyranny can be greater than that of the psychopath; 
in no place is more selfishness portrayed than in the home. 
The following is a characteristic exhibition of such neuras- 
thenie despotism. The woman, who claimed to be ill,

such a way as to make a short visit distinctly painful for 
the visitor. Because of her condition the actual work of 
housekeeping was largely done by her husband or mother- 
in-law. Her function was chiefly to command and to find 
fault. Her husband was, as one would expect, both un- 
happy and unsuccessful. His wife’s selfishness spoiled his 
chances of professional advancement and he found it nee- 
essary from time to time to move away from one locality 
to start his hopeless career in a new territory. The mother- 
in-law was driven nearly to distraction but remained with 
the son because otherwise he would have found the home 
tasks put upon him unbearable. The one child was petted 
and spoiled by the mother. Everything he did was right; 
the actions of the mother-in-law and husband, always 
wrong. The patient spent most of her time reading novels. 
Her one topic of conversation was her illness, especially 
her sufferings in the past, her father and her more for- 
tunate earlier circumstances. Although selfish to a degree 
that the most casual visitor would quickly recognize, the 
psychopathic wife covered her egoism by posing as a mar- 
tyr, the victim of what she clearly intimated was an 
unfortunate marriage. It was pathetic to realize the mis- 
ortune of the husband, tied hand and foot by the sel- 
ishness of his pathological ‘‘helpmate,’’ but unwilling, on 
ecount of his affection for his child and his native sense 
f obligation, to consider the possibility of freeing himself 
y divorce. 
Self-assertion never shows itself more intensely than 
hen through nervous illness the egoistic cravings ride 
ough shod over all social and moral considerations, and the

  CHAPTER XII 
SELF-ASSERTION AND FAMILY Lire 
Many men and women after having become parents lose 
to a large extent their former self-assertion with refer- 
ence to their own personal interests, and express it in a 
new way in the family life, especially in regard to matters 
that concern the children, “What we see so clearly in these 
extreme cases is characteristic to some degree of every one 
who develops a normal family attitude. The self-assertive 
tendencies make use of the family as a means of elevating 
the self, even though the egoistic trend may be concealed 
from himself by the individual. The father prefers to 
believe that he wishes to give his children a better oppor- 
tunity than he had himself or that he is making possible 
for wife or children’ the realization of their own desires. 
The mother may think she is sacrificing for her children, 
when as a matter of fact she is carrying out her own 
purposes and is expressing her self-assertive ambitions 
through her children. However it may seem to the person 
concerned, the on-looker appreciates the fact that self- 
assertion is showing itself in the family life and often is 
creating social problems no less serious because they are 
eolored by devotion and affection. 
This turning of personal self-assertion into home chan- 
nels is of course the natural consequence of the family 
institution and represents a step in the socialization of 
the instinct. Nevertheless, as thoughtful people have 
always recognized, family self-assertion easily may become 
an obstacle to social progress and community welfare. A 
few have felt that this concentration of self in the family 
176
-P-A-G-E-189
  SELF-ASSERTION AND FAMILY LIFE 177 
unit was such a drag upon social advancement that there 
should be a great modification and limitation of family 
privacy. In order to socialize human nature, some of these 
thinkers have even been willing to sacrifice the present 
form of the family itself. 
One of the obvious and common forms of self-assertion 
in family life is the desire to create property as a means 
of family protection and advancement. This explains the 
fact that those who would destroy the rights of private 
property often desire to change the present home consider- 
ably. They feel that so long as the institution of the 
family remains in its present form, in spite of any legis- 
lation or attempted control by public opinion, self-asser- 
tion would make use of the family and would encourage 
the continuation of private property. Plato, a representa- 
tive of this group of thinkers, expresses himself as follows. 
“Both the community of property and the community 
of families, as I am saying, tend to make them more truly 
guardians; they will not tear the city in pieces by differ- 
ing about ‘mine’ and ‘not mine’; each man dragging any 
acquisition which he has made into a separate house of 
his own, where he has a separate wife and children and 
private pleasures and pains; but all will be affected as 
far as may be by the same pleasures and pains because 
they are all of one opinion about what is near and dear 
to them, and therefore they all tend toward a common 
ENG sis is) 3's And as they have nothing but their persons 
which they ean call their own, suits and complaints will 
have no existence among them; they will be delivered from 
all those quarrels of which money or children or relations 
are the occasion.’’ 
Certainly one of the common forms of self-assertion ‘is 
the desire of ambitious persons to create property for their 
(1) Plato, The Republic, p. 156, Jowett, B., tr., Colonial Press,
-P-A-G-E-190
  178 PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL ADJUSTMENT 
family and to transmit it to their children. <A great deal 
of the maliciousness of social life—unreasonable competi- 
tion, unwholesome ambition along financial lines—is not 
due to any desire on the part of the individual to create 
property for himself, but rather to his anxiety to create 
wealth for his wife and children. This is particularly 
true when he himself in his early years has suffered from 
poverty and thinks of his boyhood experience with such 
exaggeration of his misfortune that he comes to believe 
that the greatest possible good he ean bring his children 
is protection from poverty. One would suppose that such 
a man would be satisfied with his own personal success, 
that he would express his self-assertion in personal achieve- 
ment. Many times this is the case, but there are those 
who take little satisfaction in what they create for them- 
selves or in the power they maintain for themselves. Their 
distinction or power must be tied to the family unit or it 
seems lacking in primary and complete satisfaction. Such 
individuals transfer personal ambition to the more stimu- 
lating family form, and picture their children as starting 
where they themselves end. Unfortunately they are often 
wrong in their expectations and their very success proves 
the undoing of their children’s welfare. 
An unusual illustration of this occurred in a very 
wealthy suburban district, near New York City. Several 
forms of vice were intrenched in the high school life. The 
young boys were said to be gambling with large sums of 
money frequently, and both boys and girls were engaging 
in vice. This social problem seemed to be due entirely to 
the wealth that had been given the children by their par- 
ents from early years until the boys and girls became sur- 
feited, and lost all sense of adventure in normal ways. 
They had been satiated in all the normal forms of self- 
expression because they had never had any of the struggle
-P-A-G-E-191
  
SELF-ASSERTION AND FAMILY LIFE 179 
that is characteristic of wholesome childhood, and their 
irresistible desire for adventure was turned into anti-social 
and vicious behavior. Surely, the greatest curse these 
children had—the one that was undoing them and making 
their happiness impossible—was the thoughtless bestowal 
of wealth upon them by their parents. This probably to 
a large extent represented the parents’ desire to give to 
the children advantages that they themselves had not had. 
On a smaller scale, expressed in different conditions, 
one sees the same mistaken treatment of children in country 
towns and villages. Parents go without necessities to pro- 
vide what is really luxury for their children. Occasionally 
one comes upon the strange twist in the family ambition 
that leads parents to live on the poverty-level, at the 
same time accumulating, by their penurious policy, a con- 
siderable fortune for their children. As a rule when the 
children finally inherit what their parents have slowly 
saved, the sudden change in their circumstances leads to 
nothing but harm for the children. It is a striking illus- 
tration of self-assertion expressed in family ambition. 
Self-assertion also expresses itself in family experience 
‘when it begins to show itself in the desire to expend money 
land create in the family an atmosphere of luxury. This 
orm of self-assertion shows itself in all classes of society. 
Its force, however, is most clearly revealed when it leads 
he very poor to seek social distinction by purchases that 
ave little or no utility, secured perhaps by installments, 
ut which bring to the family as a whole a sense of esteem. 
‘hus’ we find the poor negro home of the South with its 
rgan™ that no one in the family can play, because the 
aving of it in itself seems to lead to distinction, and if 
ne family has such a luxury another family imitates it.

Sometimes in very poor families one child, usually a girl, 
is chosen for a concentration of family pride. She is 
dressed differently from the others, far beyond the ability 
of the family, and naturally by the process becomes self- 
conseious and spoiled. It is felt by all the other members 
of the family that the child is representative of the family 
as a whole and brings to it a sense of distinction. This 
elevates the self-esteem of each individual. 
_~ Another expression of family self-assertion is found in 
the almost universal desire to lift the family by associa- 
tion with superiors. It is especially found in ‘‘society’’ 
in the narrow sense, and the ‘‘climber”’ is familiar to 
everyone. The same egoistic family-striving is found in 
the small village even when life as a whole is extremely 
democratic, and everyone knows everyone else. Families 
come to occupy definite positions of standing in the social 
scale and much rivalry follows, some trying to obtain by 
association a higher standing, and others seeking to main- 
tain their superiority. In some village societies the lines 
are drawn so rigidly that a stranger is constantly in 
trouble because he violates certain relationships that have 
become well established, and perhaps treats representatives 
of different families in such a way as to make some of 
them feel that their distinction has been ignored and their 
esteem injured. The country minister has to be careful 
until he has learned these subtle social gradations. This 
is what is often meant by ‘‘learning the ropes.’’ It requires 
skill and tact to serve the people as a whole without alien- 
ating the ‘‘best families.’’ 
nother form of self-assertion showing itself in family 
“ life is the desire that the family often has to obtain prestige 
through the education of its children. This is where the 
middle class oftentimes shows its craving for distinction. 
The sons and daughters can not compete with the wealthy, 
 
-P-A-G-E-193
  
SELF-ASSERTION AND FAMILY LIFE 181 
in activities that depend on money. They have no way of 
being distinguished except by going to college and in the 
college getting honors that the others, although more for- 
tunate socially, can not get. Every college instructor of 
experience knows the difference between teaching students 
ho expect to bring to their people distinction by means 
f scholarship and those who come from homes so secure 
nancially that they can not regard college standing as 
nything of serious import. 
A few years ago a very wealthy, successful lawyer, who 
ad worked himself up from nothing and had become dis- 
inguished as a leading member of the New York city bar, 
ent his elder son to a leading university. The boy’s career 
nduced him to seek a very different environment for his 
econd son, whom he therefore sent to a rather isolated 
ollege which he supposed to be free from the temptations 
fa city community. This younger son was an unusually 
leasing person, a splendid fellow in every sense of the 
ord, with a good brain and the capacity for distinguished 
cholarship. The father asked several members of the 
olleze faculty to help his son as far as possible. They 
ound it very difficult to report from time to time to the 
ather that the boy was doing well enough to justify his 
taying in college. The father was dissatisfied with the 
on’s career and most exacting in his demands from his 
aculty friends for help in his problem. It finally became 
ecessary to tell him frankly: ‘‘You want your boy to have 
s much ambition and as much sense of struggle as you 
ad, when you started with nothing and made a great 
areer for yourself; and he starts with everything and has 
othing to work for. It is unreasonable to expect any boy 
o respond with ambition to such circumstances.’”? The 
ather, doubtless, had already discovered the situation but 
ardly knew what. to do. 
   
-P-A-G-E-194

here are four kinds of children that are particularly 
in danger of exploitation because of the self-assertive crav- 
  ings of parents: the wealthy child, the only child, the 
sick child and the favorite child. 
It is difficult to bring up an only child in a normal 
manner. The danger of spoiling such a child is very great; 
perhaps we must give credit to the wholesome correctives 
of childhood society for the fact that so many only chil- 
dren are not injured by their handicap. It is a tribute 
to the self-control and good sense of the parent who suc- 
ceeds in making of his only child an unselfish, modest and 
self-reliant individual, when the temptations to hurt the 
child are so many and so subtle. | 
Here is a case of an only child in constant trouble with 
teachers. According to his mental testing he should be 
ranked as having a superior mind; in school attainment 
he was, however, a considerable failure, ranking below asso- 
ciates of his own age. The mother’s life centered in her 
only child. She could not speak his name without accents 
that were so apparent in their intensity that they were 
necessarily harmful for the child to hear. It was no wonder 
that the child felt the need of divorcing himself from his 
parents. The mother had to be told, ‘‘You are the most 
dangerous person that your son comes in contact with. If 
the child’s life is wrecked you are the one who will have 
to take the blame for it, because you are not giving him 
a reasonable amount of self-expression.’’ ‘‘Well,’’ she 
said, ‘‘that is perhaps true, but you can not understand. 
how much he means to me.’’ She soon saw that this made} 
it all the more necessary for her to hide from the son her| 
feeling, to some extent, and to let him drift out of the 
home more and more in order to give him a fair chance. 
In such circumstances the parents must exercise unusual 
self-control lest they handicap the child.     
              
             
-P-A-G-E-195
' SELF-ASSERTION AND FAMILY LIFE 183 
Then there is the sickly child. Whether really sickly or 
only supposedly so, he runs grave risks because the family 
is likely to adjust itself to his needs to so large an extent. 
Both affection and family ambition impel the parents to 
treat the weak child with special attention. Sometimes 
doctors cater to the over-anxious interests of the parents 
and magnify the difficulty of the child far beyond its true 
significance. This child grows up with the habitual thought 
that he is not like other people and therefore should have 
special privileges, which he takes. Within the family no 
more intense form of self-assertion can be developed than 
that resulting from the excessive attention given a sickly 
child. All the members of the family cater to that child’s 
welfare. The younger child, especially, loves that. It 
gives him power. He is the first consideration in all the 
doings of the family. He has more choice and more privi- 
leges than any of the others. In all sorts of ways other 
people have to minister to what is his self-assertion. He 
rows up, the psychiatrists tell us, often neurotic, not so 
uch because he is sick as because he has been pampered. 
e finds it difficult later in his mature social experience 
0 play the game of life unless he is catered to and treated 
ith undue consideration. 
_-There is also the favorite child. Just why there should 
e a favorite child seems hard to tell, but we have such 
ndividuals. The famous story of Joseph illustrates the 
avoritism shown children, especially when everybody 
ecognizes that there are to be no more. A student who 
as now become a very sensible man was during his child- 
ood a trial for his parents. For a long time it did not 
eem as though he could recover. He was the last child 
orn in a family of five or six. It was clear that there 
ould be no more children, and his father and mother took 
n attitude toward him entirely different from their atti-    
      
    
    
   
   
     
     
    
-P-A-G-E-196
  184 PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL ADJUSTMENT 
tude toward the others. From the beginning everything 
he did was right. He had no need of doing the work the 
others were supposed to do. The family was very exact- 
ing with reference to the older children. Finally the boy 
went to college. At college he was a trial to all instructors ; 
among his fellows he was very unpopular. Although a stu- 
dent of ability he was too self-opinionated to do himself 
justice. No man in thé class was treated by his class- 
mates with such hostility. His intense self-assertion be 
came a very great burden, fulfilling the prophecy of thos: 
who had witnessed the indulgent treatment given him b; 
both parents from his birth. His sisters and brothers an 
neighbors had protested in vain against the favoritis: 
shown him. His life career has been blighted by the intens 
egotism that was certainly in his case produced in the home 
We have in the family-life difficulties between the mem 
bers of the family due to the self-assertion that every indi 
vidual expresses in the family life. It comes about no 
because an individual is selfish ahd seeks to exploit anothe 
member of the family, but because his self-expression col 
lides with that of another. A parent, for example, ma; 
/ dictate to the children because in that way he has a 
opportunity to express his own self-assertion. He has per 
haps great ambition for the child. The child does not wan’ 
what his parent desires for him. The parent in that cas 
may not be selfish, at least in the ordinary sense. He will 
sacrifice for the child, and judging from the outside yo 
might say that he was particularly unselfish; but becaus 
there is a difference of attitude or a difference of judgmen’ 
or sympathy, or purpose, or temperament between paren 
and child there comes about a struggle within the famil 
life, and the different members of the family are likely t 
be seriously divided under such circumstances. In all sort 
of ways there is opportunity for self-assertive clashes no 
       
       
        
         
         
      
-P-A-G-E-197
SELF-ASSERTION AND FAMILY LIFE 185 
only between parent and child but even more between 
brothers and sisters. The danger of such family disputes 
and divisions is universally recognized. To the social psy- 
chologists they are not, however, merely unfortunate dis- 
turbances that mar family harmony, but positive expres- 
sions of self-assertion that must seek some outlet for 
individual aggression and must receive adjustment and 
socialization. It is when the expression of egoistic desires 
by the various members of the family remains excessive and 
is not subordinated to the welfare of the family as a 
whole that a serious discord arises and conditions are 
brought about that prevent the wholesome functioning of 
the home. 
We must not think of family life as merely a static 
experience, by means of which the largest temporary hap- 
piness for its members results. Home is not a sort of 
refuge place where everybody goes to be comfortable, but 
it is an educational institution where people are trained 
for life; and the home that offers free expression to its 
different members, as far as that is possible, is the family 
where there is the best condition for social development 
even when it leads to some clashing of personal desires. 
The despotic family, where one person rules, is a family 
where there may not be discord but that is because there 
is no normal family life at all. It is a dominance which 
does not train the members of the family for life in a 
wholesome manner. Therefore, a good family life will 
always have need for adjustment. No one individual will 
have the right of way over the others. There will be 
discussion ; there will be disputes at times, and to a small 
extent quarrels. In a normal family as ages change there 
has to be constant adjustment because of this. If you 
could make a reasonable program for family behavior when 
one child was twelve, another eight, a third sixteen, and
-P-A-G-E-198
186 PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL ADJUSTMENT 
a fourth eighteen, three or four years later there would 
be need of another radical adjustment. 
With the coming of the child to the adolescent age, new 
and unreasonable self-assertion is to be expected. Before 
this he may have been peacefully subservient ; now he de- 
clares for a share of independence and resents authority, 
especially from brothers or sisters. Parents whose atti- 
tude has been one of repression must certainly modify their 
policy now. The parent also must always adjust discipline 
and freedom of decision to the actual possibilities of self- 
control as they demonstrate themselves from time to time. 
The family that is socially most efficient is the kind that 
requires adjustment of the conflicting expressions of self- 
assertion constantly. The static family established on a 
definite but necessarily narrow policy and continuing its 
program just as long as it holds together is the worst pos- 
sible home for the social training of the individual mem- 
bers, though it may be as peaceful a family as can be 
imagined. 
The social test of the family is its ability to produce 
wholesome, social individuals. It is not organized primarily 
for personal happiness. Its biological function centers 
about the offspring. Its sociological significance lies chiefly 
in its training of children. The home, therefore, naturally 
illustrates all the struggles that accompany growth. Its 
normal functioning produces occasional disturbances that 
are the ‘‘growing pains’’ of the process of maturing and 
socializing the members of the family. The family to be 
socially wholesome must prepare for the social autonomy 
of its individuals. Therefore, too much family may be 
as risky as too little and too much affection centered upon 
the home as dangerous as too little. 
The home must necessarily fail in its social service unless 
the earlier object-love of the children is loosened and trans-
-P-A-G-E-199
  SELF-ASSERTION AND FAMILY LIFE 187 
ferred as they mature. As the child is led away from a 
too strong fixation of affection upon one or both parents, 
changes in the habits of the household necessarily follow. 
The wise parent encourages opportunities that permit the 
child to form new, out-of-the-home associations. The unwise 
parent will attempt to block such new relationships and 
thus keep the child in filial bondage. As the child develops 
new emotional attachments, the parent is required also to 
make corresponding changes in his own emotional atti- 
tudes. He also must avoid an exclusive love-fixation upon 
the child, or by the intensity of his emotional expressions 
he will encourage the child to continue his former con- 
centration. 
Of course this program is very different from that which 
in the past has to many appeared the ideal expression of 
parental love. There can be no doubt, however, that recent 
psychological science is right in insisting that gradually 
the child has to be released from the close ties of home 
affection, natural and wholesome during his first years, if 
the home is to do its duty in helping him develop his 
personality. Otherwise the home becomes a deforming 
influence. What often on the surface is considered unusual 
unselfishness and sacrifice on the part of the parent is 
ctually intense and ruinous egoism. The test of the home 
in the end has to be social efficiency. 
The son or daughter who continues after adolescence the 
tense attachment to mother or father characteristic of 
arly childhood is extending a relationship beyond its 
iological sanction. This brings great risk that the youth 
ill fail to meet his proper social obligations. He is likely 
0 prove an unsuccessful husband or an indifferent citizen. 
s he grows older and more and more illustrates his 
mability to act with the maturity of his years, the unfor- 
unate type of his affection will become increasingly clear

and is likely to draw expressions of pity or ridicule from 
his associates. The child, unfortunately, rather than the 
parent, must shoulder the consequences of the latter’s sel- 
fishness. 
As the child grows away from his childhood, the parent 
must needs insure himself against the emotional void that 
is likely to appear if he has cultivated only those interests 
that center about the offspring. He must to a degree wean 
himself from his own emotional fixation or suffer a deep 
sense of privation. From the beginning, therefore, the 
wholesome home will consider its outside social relation- 
ships and will make provision for the maintenance of con- 
tacts with community life. Narrow family self-assertion 
will be avoided by stress upon the social purpose of the 
home.

CHAPTER XIII 
THe Emotional Maturing or THE Boy 
The child cannot thrive without love. Unless he receives 
an expression of affection from parent or guardian in his 
early years he suffers an emotional privation that is bound 
to influence not only his childhood but also his entire adult 
career. Unless he experiences affection a void in his life 
is created which subsequent events cannot fully remove. 
His welfare therefore depends upon his having contact with 
love from the beginning. He has great need of love. He 
responds naturally to the affection bestowed upon him and 
it is one of the most potent of all the influences that 
awaken his psychic and social life. The child is led into 
altruistic attitudes and conduct as a result of his responses 
to the love of his parents. His attention, formerly exclu- 
sively concerned with the gratification of his own desires, 
is turned first toward his mother and then toward his 
father; and thus begin his altruistic sentiments which 
must largely decide the quality of his social behavior in 
nis adult period. The success of society’s later effort to 
ocialize him through the processes of intellectual and moral 
instruction will be determined by the extent that he has 
ntered into altruistic behavior as a result of his affection 
or his parents. 
It is also true that this childhood affection is bound to 
how in all subsequent experiences of love. The way in 
hich the child expresses infantile love, the responses called 
orth by the parents, will largely color all later manifesta- 
ions of affection. The child’s adult behavior will tend to 
ehearse his early happenings which will hamper or minis- 
191     
    
      
    
    
      
  
-P-A-G-E-204
  C192 «PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL ADJUSTMENT 
ter to wholesome attitudes of affection. It is the teaching of 
Freud and his followers that these first experiences of love 
between parents and child, when they are unwholesomely 
expressed, become the cause of later disturbances in the 
emotional life of the adult and frequently bring about the 
development of a neurosis. 
The response of the child to love changes as he develops. 
If he is to have a complete, normal emotional growth it is 
necessary that these changes take place. He can no more 
remain stationary in his affection and have normal growth 
than he can become fixed in physical or mental develop- 
ment without suffering retardation. The affection-response 
that is out of season because of its emotional immaturity 
becomes, therefore, a harmful influence bound to injure his 
conduct and restrict his happiness. 
wd ffection involves a social situation. Love is an expres- 
sion of give-and-take.; The child enters into social experi- 
ence through his love-life and learns the meaning of rela- 
tionship as a result of his attention upon the people who 
furnish to him evidences of affection. Instinct provides 
the basis of this inter-relationship but instinct, untrained 
and unrestrained, is not sufficient guide for the parent in 
his task of helping the child to pass safely through the 
various phases of love. The instincts of the child also 
are sensitive to the conditions furnished by the environ- 
ment and are too easily modified to be adequate for the 
guidance of the child’s affectionate development. 
Not only are parents unwise,as is generally recognized, 
in their affection; but parenthood itself has inherent ele- 
ments that are obstacles to the child’s wholesome progress. 
Parenthood is better prepared to furnish the much needed

value and less need the affection of the parents. The par- 
ents’ love is a social product which exhibits the combined 
results of instinct, biological selection working over a long 
period of time and tending to preserve through inheritance 
those family strains that furnish strong parental instincts, 
tradition and the early experiences of the individual him- 
self. The affection of the parent therefore is constructed by 
social influences upon an instinctive basis and has the 
                                                    
bitty. By the process of the aeaketnins of the parents’ 
instincts as the creature matures, the offspring of the lower 
nimal is in time set free. The human parent on the other 
and covets emotionally the continuance of the early expe- 
ience when his affection exclusively ministered to the 
hild; and, contrary often to his conscious purposes, he 
bstructs the emotional maturing of his child. 
The influence of the parent over the child is of course 
uring early childhood greater than that of any other 
erson, and it is not difficult for the parent to operate upon 
he child in such a way as to make the transition through 
he various phases of affection arduous or even impossible.

The child does not react the same to both his parents. 
ery early, much earlier than common thought in the past 
as been wont to suppose, the child distinguishes between 
he mother and father in such a way that his behavior is 
lightly modified because of his recognition that they are 
m some sense different and demand from him different 
reatment. The mother naturally means the more to the 
hild and the responses given her are more laden with 
ffection. In these elemental reactions the child begins to 
istinguish in his affection the existence of the two sexes 
nd to govern his conduct slightly in harmony with his

differing attitude toward them. Thus he is led to the dis- 
covery of the essential differences between father and 
mother, and at the same time he expresses himself in 
his affection in harmony with this difference of sex. In 
this manner there creeps into his conduct a difference of 
response that is built fundamentally upon the recognition 
of sex difference.

The diagram printed above is an attempt to chart the 
development of affection in the life history of the normal 
boy. The age divisions are merely suggestive since there 
is necessarily considerable variation in the rate of maturity. 
When the affection is primarly felt for members of th 
opposite sex it is placed above the line; for members 0: 
the same sex it appears below the line. 
©The boy’s development is more simple and less liable t 
abnormality than is the girl’s. He starts with a hetero 
sexual affection as a result of his contact with his mother 
She on her part due to her own heterosexual tendencies i 
likely to extend to him greater demonstration of affectioi 
than she bestows upon children of her own sex. Thi 
expression of her love is likely to awaken in the chil 
reciprocal feelings and he naturally looks to his mothe 
rather than to his father for satisfaction of his desire fo 
attention. It is possible also that the boy is instinctivel, 
led toward a heterosexual relationship.
-P-A-G-E-207
  THE EMOTIONAL MATURING OF THE BOY 195 
During this first period of his life, about eight years, 
the boy clings closely to his mother and from her gets his 
largest satisfactions and upon her bestows the greater affec- 
tion. Toward the close of this period, however, he is led 
from his mother and toward his father. He is pushed 
forward into the new attitude by his instincts and his 
social contacts. His instinctive life is awakening to new 
activities and demanding of him more out-of-the-home expe- 
riences. He is interested in enterprises that are primarily 
masculine in type. The world of things catches his fancy 
and he begins to appreciate the kind of life represented 
by his father and his sex. He plays more and more with 
boys rather than with girls and boys. These boys like 
himself are also turning from the infantile mother-attitude 
to the stage of father-emulation. Normally there begins a 
hero-attitude toward the father. It is now that the father’s 
comradeship will mean most to the boy. The undiscern- 
ing father throws away his greatest opportunity to influ- 
ence the boy, usually because of lack of understanding 
rather than utter selfishness. This is the time that the 
boy talks of his desire to be like his ‘‘Daddy,’’ that he 
imitates his father and gives his interest to those things 
that concern his father. 
_ Again by the normal ripening of his instincts the boy 
transfers his attention somewhat from his home and par- 
ents and increases his interest in his playmates. These will 
be for the most part boys. His curiosity, pugnacity, self- 
assertion and other motivating drives bring him more and 
more in association with playmates. School and especially 
games occupy the center of his interest. He no longer 
is so dependent upon his mother. He cares much less 
bout his father’s interests but finds instead his supreme 
ocial gratification in winning the approval of his mates. 
ow, as by common impulse, boys join gangs and clubs. 14

  196 . PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL ADJUSTMENT 
Girls and girl interests are largely taboo. Sisters are looked 
upon as inferiors and frequently are regarded as troubles. 
Parental standards are in varying measure discounted. 
There is, however, the greatest sensitiveness to the atti- 
tude of members of the gang. 
Then comes the fiery ordeal of adolescence. The girls, 
once taboo or ignored, now become the one compelling topic 
of conversation, the most persistent focus of attention. 
The boy crosses over from his long homosexual associa- 
tions assisted by the outburst of the new instinctive atti- 
tudes of adolescence. Now he is prepared to concentrate 
his affection on some member of the opposite sex; and 
teachers and parents do their utmost to keep him from a 
premature fixation of affection in order that before begin- 
ning family responsibilities he may complete the education 
which he needs for his adult career. 
In the course of its various phases from mother-love to 
marriage, this development of the affections runs risk of 
a miscarriage of emotional well-being. It is the business 
of wholesome training for life to guide the developing per- 
sonality safely through these dangers. It is imperative 
that the parent and teacher realize clearly the different 
pitfalls that the boy must pass in the changing forms of 
his affection. Even if the child cannot absolutely avoid 
all difficulties in the course of his psychic growth, those 
who deal with him ean greatly assist him to escape serious 
emotional harm by recognizing the points where he has 
failed in his reactions. Indeed, if he has made any con- 
siderable departure at any point from the normal line of 
progress it will be of great value to him in his adult period 
if he, himself, can recognize his variations and discover 
their influence upon his conduct. Bringing the knowledge 
of these variations clearly into consciousness and explaining 
their meaning is one of the methods by which the psy-

       chiatrist assists those who are having special difficulty in 
meeting their social responsibilities. 
The most outstanding danger that the boy meets in his 
development of affection is the risk of permanently fixing 
his love upon his mother in such a way as to make it im- 
possible for him to go through the succeeding experiences. 
The possibility of this happening has long and universally 
been recognized. For example savage initiation rites, as 
practiced among the Australians, attempt to sever the rela- 
tionship of mother and boy and in case the boy fails to 
pass successfully through the ordeal his association with the 
women folks is held responsible and ever afterward he 
is considered as belonging with the women of the tribe 
rather than with the men. 
There are many different ways by which the child may 
be hindered in his efforts to pass out of the dominant 
mother-fixation of the first period. His mother may con- 
tinue year after year to treat him with the same lavishness 
f affection as was his right as an infant. She may use 
er hold upon him to make him prejudiced against any 
ew competing interest. She may prolong his early help- 
essness until his dependence upon her becomes so habitual 
hat it continues even up into his adult period. She may 
emand of him such show of affection that she becomes 
ll-satisfying and he feels no need of any other. Teachers 
f boys occasionally find ‘young men of high school age 
eceiving from their mother infantile attention and affec- 
ion and responding in such a way as to make their emo- 
ional maturing impossible. 
The mother may hamper the child especially when he 
tarts to transfer his regard from her to his father. This 
ay be a conscious process or one of which the mother is 
maware. In either case the father is discounted and his 
alue for the child concealed. This attitude of the mother 
 
-P-A-G-E-210
  198 PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL ADJUSTMENT 
may have for its motive deep selfishness or lack of con- 
fidence in the father. It may of course be both. In that 
case she uses the apparent’ failures of the father to protect 
herself from the withdrawal of the boy’s supreme regard. 
The loss of the father through death or desertion may 
make the task of the mother doubly hard and necessarily 
prevent any reasonable opportunity for the boy to transfer 
from his mother to a member of his own sex. 
Attention has been called™ to the danger the teacher 
runs in putting great stress upon the boy’s loyalty to his 
mother as a motive for school work. To some boys, espe- 
cially if they are lacking in masculine aggressiveness, this 
motive is very powerful and the temptation of the teacher 
to make use of it is correspondingly great. Appealing to 
this motive is likely to increase the difficulty eventually for 
it keeps the boy looking to the past rather than to the 
future. The proper motive for the boy in the ’teens is one 
that puts emphasis upon social loyalty and self-expression. 
By preparing to meet his future responsibilities the boy 
best honors his mother and most fortunately satisfies her 
desire for appreciation. Appeal should be made to the 
virility of the boy. If he is to continue to belong merely 
to the mother and to draw vitality for conduct only from 
his desire to please his mother there is little hope of his 
arriving at manhood’s estate. 
The difficulty is clear and simple. He remains emo- 
tionally infantile and therefore cannot pass on through 
the succeeding stages of growth which are to prepare him 
to act a man’s part in the world. Marriage will at least 
prove difficult. If he marries at all he is likely to be 
too much influenced by his mother and to demand from his 
life mate rather more of a mother than a wife. He will

-P-A-G-E-211
  
THE EMOTIONAL MATURING OF THE BOY 199 
react adversely to his wife unless she treats him with the 
tender consideration of the mother. He will demand exces- 
sive attention, a magnifying of his virtues and an ignoring 
of his faults or he will remove himself further and further 
emotionally from the wife and make a happy marriage im- 
possible. While the mother lives he is unlikely to marry 
at all. If he does, her wishes in the matter. will greatly 
influence his choice. From beginning to end his marriage 
is likely to be abnormal and most unsatisfactory to all 
concerned, 
It must not be forgotten that the father may hamper 
the boy’s first transference of affection. He may be so 
domineering, so fear-causing, so indifferent or so openly 
a social derelict that the boy cannot respect him, much 
less worship him. In such a case the boy may return to 
his more secure infantile mother-fixation or he may pre- 
maturely set his affection upon his boy comrades. Psy- 
chopathie cases clearly disclose the persistence into adult 
behavior of the importance of such failures on the part 
of the father. Especially does this appear when the 
father badly treats the boy and instills in him deep- 
seated fears. 
By mere neglect, very busy, ambitious fathers are apt 
to deprive their sons of a part of the advantage successful 
men may be to their offspring. Finding little time for 
association with their children, such men emotionally 
neglect them. Sons, in order to transfer their affection 
with least inner disturbance, need not only a father whom 
they can admire but also one whom they can learn to 
know. ‘There is no substitute for such comradeship of 
father and son and no parent’s obligation is satisfied by 
merely providing material resources for the son. 
It devolves upon teacher, mother and father, espe- 
cially the latter, to give the boy a winsome idea of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-212
  (20) PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL ADJUSTMENT 
new level of growth toward which he moves. Life can 
not be pictured too exacting, too rigid, too serious without 
making it harder for the boy to take the next step with 
confidence. If growing up becomes at any point too pain- 
ful a process or promises to become too painful, the child 
will naturally recoil and do his utmost to preserve the 
existing status, even in some cases to retreat to an earlier 
and easier period. A great measure of unnecessary suffer- 
ing and failure in life originates in this reluctance of the 
child to go on in the progress of growth because he has 
come to feel its difficulty and cannot sense its advantage. 
Such emotional retardation sooner or later shows itself in 
school work; and unless the individual finds a source of 
courage, the evil consequences of the experience continue to 
show themselves throughout life. 
fo The boy generally passes easily from the idealization of 
the father to the period of gang loyalty. Gradually he 
recognizes that the father is unable to satisfy all his needs; 
increasingly he enjoys the fellowship and approval of the 
boys of his own age. His greatest danger during this 
period of comradeship is the fact that he may get into 
social difficulty from his subservience to the gang. The 
influence of his boy associates may be positively anti-social. 
If so, he may be led into some escapade that will bring hi 
before the court and into social disgrace. The shame, the 
treatment given him by his home, his sehool, his communit; 
may be such that he develops a chronic and aggressive anti 
social attitude. This is one of the ways in which societ; 
makes its criminals. By getting insight into the situatio: 
and, by administering counsel rather than punishment, t 
prevent temporary and trivial doings from becoming 
persistent source of wrong conduct is the task of th 
juvenile court; and its social service in keeping boys fro 
starting criminal careers is of inestimable value. 
               
   
       
    
    
-P-A-G-E-213
THE EMOTIONAL MATURING OF THE BOY 201 
The impulses that begin to express themselves in new 
ways and with novel powers in adolescence assist the boy 
to make his final transference. If his course previously 
has been well-directed the boy is not in great risk in his 
final maturing experience. He courts, marries and becomes 
a parent. There is of course the possibility that his affec- 
tion may settle upon some young woman who will gradually 
disclose herself as too selfish or too false or too shallow 
to deserve his respect. His shock may harden him so that 
from that time on he will not feel attraction toward the 
opposite sex. Most men, however, with a history of average 
success in meeting the emotional transferences of the earlier 
periods will not permanently react to such an experience 
of disillusionment with bitterness or hostility to women. 
Usually the affection is finally transferred to a more satis- 
fying representative of womanhood and the earlier mistake 
happily is forgotten. 
Recently I was consulted with reference to the following 
family situation. A young man who for many years had 
lived with his mother, and had been his mother’s favorite 
child, was obliged by his employment to be away from home 
for several months, became engaged and later married. 
From the beginning his marriage was unhappy. Indeed 
by a process of attempting to delay it from time to time 
he revealed his real reluctance to assume his new responsi- 
bilities. Had the young woman in the case not been per- 
sistent, without doubt he would have gladly broken the 
engagement. Hardly had the ceremony been completed 
when the mother’s influence began to be felt adversely 
in the new family. The husband constantly compared the 
wife and mother to the disadvantage of the former. He 
complained of every variation of the wife from the routine 
of the mother and quickly made clear to his mother that 
he was dissatisfied. She took his part as she had done
-P-A-G-E-214
  202 PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL ADJUSTMENT 
in all the difficulties of his life during childhood and up 
to the time of his marriage. This naturally increased still 
more the tension of the new family. Eventually after a 
very serious quarrel the young wife frankly told her hus- 
band that it seemed to her that he was the spoiled boy of 
his mother, who had never grown up. To this he reacted 
violently and determined upon divorce. He came to me 
for consultation and after a long, tedious process of self- 
revelation he was able to recognize the truth of his wife’s 
statement. The mother also was made to realize her share 
of responsibility for the family breakdown. The divorce 
was prevented and gradually the home became reasonably 
happy through mutual understanding. The young hus- 
band’s subsequent business career, however, clearly revealed 
the unfortunate consequences of an excessive mother- 
fixation.

     The development of the girl’s affection is not so simpl 
as that of the boy’s. It also has greater opportunities fo: 
emotional disturbances. The girl begins, as does the boy, 
with a fixation upon the mother. But this in the case o 
the girl is a homosexual experience and thus at the ver, 
start of the evolution of affection of the girl there is satis 
faction in a relationship which does not require cognizane' 
of sex differences. It is easier therefore for the girl t

  THE EMOTIONAL MATURING OF THE GIRL 205 
urge, which, given opportunity, appears very early in the 
girl, is at least partly the cause of this transference. The 
idea of maternity after the year of six is bound to involve 
some recognition of the significance of the father and a 
turning of attention to him. If, as appears true from expe- 
rience, this new interest in the father is met by him by a 
deeper response than the boy receives from the father, 
there is an additional reason for the girl’s affection mov- 
ing somewhat away from the mother and closer to the 
father. To some extent also the greater freedom of the 
father attracts the girl toward him, for often at this time 
the little girl first protests against the social limitations 
placed upon her because of her sex, and states her wish 
that she were a boy and could grow into a man. 
The daughter, once she turns to the father, is not infre- 
quently jealous of the mother’s relationship with him; and 
she may manoeuvre so as to bring about friction between 
the parents. She is more apt to accomplish this disturb- - 
ance in case she continues her father-fixation into the adult 
period. Under such conditions she may show deep but 
subtle jealousy of the mother and at any opportunity 
attempt to force from the father a decision which requires 
his choosing to support the daughter against the wife or 
the wife against the daughter. If the father fails to sym- 
pathize with her, and she alone acts as judge, she threatens 
to leave home and sometimes finally does. Whether in 
or out of the home she will persist in her efforts to bind her 
father to herself and to wedge herself in between her par- 
ents. The last resort of some of these women appears 
to be the development of some nervous trouble which 
will force the family to give them sympathy. They are 
then likely to use to the uttermost the opportunity pro- 
vided by their physician’s statement that they must not 
be annoyed, to tyrannize over the other members of the
-P-A-G-E-218
    206 PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL ADJUSTMENT 
family and especially to put upon the father demands 
which under other circumstances he would not be likely 
to grant. 
The following case illustrates an extreme father-fixation 
followed by a nervous breakdown. X, a very successful 
business man, has two children. The older, a daughter, was 
his favorite child. To her he gave an unusual amount of 
attention for a man so engrossed in his occupation. He is 
exceedingly ambitious, and according to his own statement 
instilled in his daughter from early years a profound cray- 
ing for distinction. Unfortunately he never considered 
the possibility of her failing to fulfill his ambitions for 
her. She was well educated and at the end of her training 
for life she undertook, one after another, vocational oppor- 
tunities. In none of them was she successful. With every 
repeated experience which she interpreted as failure, she 
withdrew increasingly her sympathy from her father, 
although up to that time they had been inseparable com- 
rades. The climax came when she and her mother had a 
quarrel and the father was called in to umpire. He sup- 
ported his wife against the daughter and soon after she 
had a very serious and strange nervous breakdown. From 
that time until now—some five years—she has refused to 
have anything at all to do with the father. The money 
that she has received from him has had to pass through 
the hands of the mother. She makes use of every oppor- 
tunity in conversation with her former friends to critigize 
and condemn her father. It is apparent to all except her- 
self that she is reacting with the characteristics of the 
neurotic disposition against what became a painful father. 
fixation. She attempted to follow the footsteps of he 
father and arrive at distinction. Apparently she did no: 
have the physical or intellectual vitality to accomplish he 
purpose. To save herself from condemnation she destroy:

her former overpowering eagerness to satisfy her father’s 
ambition for her. 
If the girl passes into the third period safely and bestows 
her affection more largely out of the family upon girl 
friends she encounters a new risk. Her fellowship with 
her own sex continues into adolescence and social con- 
vention requires that she sublimate the newly awakening 
impulses that would otherwise turn her attention to men. 
She matures sooner than the boy and the impulses that 
make for heterosexual interests arrive sooner than social 
convention arranges for their expression. The girl, there- 
fore, may force these new impulses to express themselves 
in her present associations and in this manner for the 
second time in her career she runs risk of becoming per- 
manently homosexual in her affection. Instinct would turn 
her attention to boys. Convention attempts to prevent 
this and to postpone until a later time her contact with 
the opposite sex. As a result she falls back upon her 
present social resources and finds in other girls a consider- 
ble outlet for her need of a more significant association. 
In this critical fourth period the girl has to depend upon 
er father. For a second time the task of bringing her 
into wholesome heterosexual affection depends upon him. 
he will naturally gravitate to him for sympathy and com- 
adeship. For three or four years he has a deeper entrance 
in her life than has anyone else and if he uses his oppor- 
unity wisely he has the satisfaction of seeing her gradually 
eek in men of her own age the comradeship that her 
ormal emotional and social development requires. During 
his period the father can be more helpful to her than at 
ny other period of her life. It is his privilege to reveal 
o her the strength and trustworthiness of masculine char- 
eter so that because of him she can somewhat under- 
tand men and have confidence in them. His exhibition
-P-A-G-E-220
    208 PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL ADJUSTMENT 
of himself will most determine her opinion of men and 
her reaction to them. If he fails her, she runs danger of 
carrying through life, whether she marries or not, an 
abnormal attitude toward men and inherent lack of con- 
fidence in them. The father may fail. His inability to 
cope with the situation may result from his lack of capacity, 
his intellectual or moral weakness, or it may come about 
because of the previous attitude of the mother toward the 
father, perhaps toward all men. 
Now will appear the mother’s early teaching and its 
influence upon the daughter. The mother may have criti- 
cized the father, ridiculed him, discounted him in the 
presence of the child. She may have talked much about 
the vices of men. There are all sorts of baneful sugges- 
tions within her power, especially when she has herself 
been discontented or disappointed in her marriage. As a 
consequence of such influences the daughter may recoil 
from her father first and later from all men. If this hap- 
pens she is unable to cross the line into the heterosexual 
attitude that is biologically her right; and must withdraw 
within herself or find in women the satisfaction of her 
desire for intimate sympathy and contact. 
Y is a typical example of a young woman who finds it 
impossible to commit herself to heterosexual affection. Her 
mother apparently married unwisely and brought up her 
daughter to have little respect for the father who had| 
died in the daughter’s early childhood. From the begin-

possibility of marriage she immediately transfers her inter- 
est to some other person. She particularly enjoys such 
measure of comradeship with older married men as con- 
vention permits. The young woman recognizes the child- 
hood cause of her present difficulties but she never is able 
to go beyond day-dreaming of marriage. 
It is not strange that the facts as gathered by those who 
have to do with the neurotic problems of women seem to 
oint to the conclusion that girls more easily and more 
‘requently than boys remain for too long a time in the stage 
f£ mother love. The evidence at present suggests that the 
tage of father-fixation is built upon the earlier mother 
ffection. The girl carries over her affection in a way 
he boy does not need to do, for in his case the relationship ' 
is not merely a change of affection; it is also different in 
ality and contains the element of idealization of the 
ather’s activities. It is the desire for achievement that 
eems to give motive power to the boy’s changing from 
other to father. In the case of the girl it is rather more 
malloyed affection and the satisfying of impulses that are 
mvolved in her growing maternal interest. 
The girl’s fixation upon the mother has a deeper and 
ore disturbing effect upon the girl’s emotional life than 
as the boy’s, for her mother love is more easily main- 
lained throughout life and more frequently shows itself in 
he neurosis. 
If the girl enters upon the second period and bestows 
pon the father the deeper affection that formerly she 
ave the mother she assumes all the risks that the boy meets: 
his mother-fixation. The girl may be loth to turn from 
e father to her schoolmates later. Either her. own 
clination or the excessive indulgent love of the father 
ay lead to her permanently turning her affection to the 
ther. In this case she will, like the boy suffering from

mother-fixation, find marriage difficult. If she marries 
finally she is likely to be too much influenced by her 
father’s characteristics and to seek in her husband her 
earlier love-relationship with her father. However much 
her husband may have suggested the father in some form 
of likeness especially significant to her, he will, neverthe- 
less, fail to duplicate the father’s personality at other essen- 
tial points and she is likely to find marriage disappointing. 
Wives of this sort are forever talking to visitors and to 
the family about their fathers and making compariso: 
between the husband’s failures and the father’s suppose 
successes. They are also given to excessive ‘‘love-story’ 
reading, finding in fiction the opportunity to turn from th 
disappointing home-reality. If the father attained emin 
ence in any definite occupation or enterprise they also see! 
some way of getting public recognition, preferably in th 
same way as the parent. In such eases the home is ap 
to be neglected and at best thought of as an unpleasan 
obligation. 
An interesting psychological study of Charlotte Bront 
reveals very clearly the unfortunate influence of her fathe: 
upon her development of affection. The father was 
hypochondriac, a dyspeptic and an ascetic. He did no 
believe in marriage and was particularly opposed to Cha 
lotte’s marrying. He was very fond of her and equall: 
jealous. Unable to get on well with his fellows, he becam 
a monarch of the home. He kept Charlotte constantl, 
by his side and under his authority. Her supreme desir 
was to please him and minister to his whims. -His changin; 
moods, his coldness and expressions of disapproval an 
criticisms for which she accepted responsibility, comin 
to her as suc tried to show her affection, made her doub 
ful of herself and distrustful of others. Thus she acquire

impossible. She was forced in upon herself emotionally 
and found refuge in books and in faney. Her mother was 
dead and thus she was doubly unfortunate. The evil 
results of her uncomfortable, tragic childhood stamped 
themselves deeply upon her personality and colored and 
hurt her art. 
In her novels as well as in her social behavior the influ- 
ences of her father and her morbid childhood are apparent. 
Hiding from herself even the real source of her romances 
she reiterated in one form after another the emotional 
stress which had resulted in her own life from her exces- 
sive devotion to her father. Her sisters also were similarly 
affected and each in turn sought an outlet in reading and 
in writing. The deforming influence of the home made 
each of the children unable to adapt herself to her social 
environment.. They were denied happiness, but from their 
experience resulted an overflowing of emotions which, 
expressed in art, gave them a portion of satisfaction. 
Society gained works of fiction second to none in their 
intensity of emotional reaction against surroundings that 
were crushing the inner self. 
It is as necessary, of course, for the father to release 
is daughter from ‘excessive fixation upon him as it is that 
e furnish her with an opportunity to idealize masculine 
haracter. Occasionally we find in life a daughter that has 
come captive to her father’s claims upon her affection to 
degree that makes maturity extremely difficult. In such 
ases the father is apt to hide the truth from himself by 
oncealing what is really selfishness under the cover of pro- 
ection. He convinces himself that the daughter is unable

lessness is forced upon her because of her effort to submerge 
her personality in harmony with his purposes. 
The case of K is especially interesting. She is the eldest 
of the three daughters of an unusual father, gifted and 
prosperous. The entire household centered about him, and 
he gave himself without stint to his daughters. This par- 
ticular daughter concentrated her entire emotional life in 
him. As she developed it became more and more difficult 
for her to pursue the type of life he chose for her. As 
a result she developed two different attitudes, one the kind 
of self demanded of her by her father and the other her 
real self, which she concealed from all others. Upon the 
death of the father she found herself stranded. She had 
many friends, culture, an attractive personality and a 
considerable social popularity. At once, however, there 
ensued a struggle between her habitual self which had been 
constructed to please her father and her original, deeper, 
instinctive self. The contest, which made it impossible for 
her either to satisfy fully her own desires or to give herself 
thoroughly to the line of conduct which she felt would 
have been the choice of her father, paralyzed her intellec- 
tual activities and destroyed her happiness. She came 
seeking an understanding of her conflict. She was quick 
to comprehend the morbid fixation which she had placed 
upon her father while living and was now attempting to 
put upon his memory; and found a satisfactory solution 
in striving along the lines of her own inclinations for the 
happiness which was her father’s deepest desire for her. 
It is obvious that the instinct of sex plays a prominent 
role throughout a girl’s development. It is in the psychic 
elements of her sex life, her reactions to sex, that mischief 
may ensue. It is not unusual for sex difficulties to show 
themselves first when the daughter begins to associate with 
her schoolmates. Curiosity about sex is pretty certain to

express itself at this time, especially when parents have 
by their lack of frankness magnified the mystery of sex. 
Then appear the results of the parents’ influence, most 
specially that of the mother, and a vicious sex attitude

ciously or unconsciously expressed, may make it exceed- 
ngly difficult for the child to have the right outlook upon

er experiences may later drive her away from all thought 
~ marriage and force her to seek only in women an outlet 
or her affections.

quickly on to the next adventure in affection and her im- 
pulses turn all the deep interests of her life toward men of 
her own age. Her emotions and her thought are con- 
centrated upon her new experiences in heterosexual asso- 
ciation. It is easy for the adult to forget how tremendous 
these reactions are in the average girl. What she wears, 
where she goes, what she does, all her behavior is primarily 
related to ‘‘man.’’ Her feeble efforts to conceal this fact 
frequently make it all the more noticeable. She is like 
an actress playing a part with her consciousness fixed upon 
her audience. 
If her new attention to men receives a favorable response 
her emotional life is wont to flow smoothly. She may still) 
err, to be sure, in her judgment and may consequently 
make an unwise choice for a life-mate, but she has at} 
least passed through all the various phases of the love expe-| 
rience that precedes adulthood. 
_--Society, especially while it tolerates war, cannot promise 
"to every woman who passes through the successive stages| 
of childhood affection a successful marriage. For many} 
there can be no marriage at all. That is particularly true| 
of the coming generation because of the great dispropor- 
tion of the two sexes as a result of the world war. The 
parent and the teacher must keep in mind the fact that th 
thwarted instincts do not have the danger of suppressed 
instincts. It is far better to go through childhood with} 
all the normal experiences of affection that belong to it 
and then not marry, than to remain single because of 
emotional misfortunes incurred in the process of growing 
up. Wholesome impulses can be sublimated and society! 
enriched. The woman who does not marry but who has 
made all the natural transferences of affection has a sub- 
stantial basis for happiness in social service. Even though] 
she has no children of her own, she is prepared to love

She is surely a better human being, more natural in her

CHAPTER XV 
Tue INFERIORITY COMPLEX AND SociaAL BEHAVIOR 
The influence of the inferiority complex shows itself in 
human experience in myriad ways and its importance for 
the understanding of human behavior can hardly be over- 
emphasized. The student of conduct therefore needs a 
clear understanding of the meaning of the inferiority com- 
plex, and this perhaps can best be gained from a brief 
statement regarding the origin of the term. 
Alfred Adler of Vienna was led by his investigations 
of the psychic effects of inferior organs upon character to 
the conviction that the chief effort of an individual suf- 
fering from any physical defect was to overcome, if pos- 
sible, the sense of inferiority. We h ong known that 
wheneyer the body was particularly hampered by the 
deficiency or defect of. any_of its organs, the body as a 
whole reacted to the situation and by increasing the activ- 
SESE Tat ontincel the We oF the avidual in as 
normal a fashion as circumstances permitted. This new 
distribution of organic function is known as compensation. 
Adler noticed that wherever this compensation took place 
there were mental peculiarities, as well as physical, that 
Tim the consciousness-of being at a disadvantage as com- 
pared with those with whom he had contacts. He dwelt 
upon his personal handicap excessively until his mental 
found that whenever 'y was hampered by some pecu- 
liarity or defect, the physical compensation process wa:

accompanied by a process of compensation in the mind 
itself. First the mind was obsessed with an idea of insuffi- 
ciency; then if the compensation was successful came the 
idea of protest against the inferiority, followed by ver 
ANCA STGS When we pai oP the felony 
complex we call this successful mental compensation ‘‘the 
masculine protest,’’ since man struggles against his weak- 
ness. Whenever the inferiority complex comes, there is 
an excessive amount of self-asser re the ife-

The neurotics, therefore, according to Adler, suffer from 
a chronic sense of inferiori ue to organic deficienci 
of some kind and-their-conduct_i i wt_to 
overcome this sense of inferiority. Thus the neurotic puts 
before himself the task of compensation, makes a mascu- 
line protest—and seeks to secure the largest possible satis- 
action of his ego-consciousness. Lacking esteem, in his 
lown eyes, he he “strives to assert himself and thus hid e from 
tfempts to push_out of consciousness the fecling of infe-

ment. The New Englander makes a virtue of necessity 
and cherishes the faults as well as the excellencies of the 
middle class. The Westerner boasts the material greatness 
of his country because he has not yet taken time to acquire 
cultural greatness. Compensation for inferiority may be     
        in conquering or rising above that very defect. The classic 
example of this latter is, of course, Demosthenes, who from 
the stutterer grew to be the orator.’’” 
The egoism of neurotics, their tendency to envy and 
jealousy, their eagerness to undervalue others, especially 
their rivals, come from the inner feeling of inferiority. 
By their psychic attitudes they stimulate themselves as 
with a whip to still greater effort in their quest for ade- 
quacy of self-satisfaction. The goal of accomplishment

When the term inferiority complex is used in this wider 
social meaning one naturally asks whether anyone escapes 
a degree of inferiority complex. The answer depends upon 
the definition given inferiority. The person who never 
feels any sense of inferiority is rare indeed, But unless 
there is a considerable and lasting and consequential infe- 
riority-experience the expression is not properly used. athe

being particularly thoughtful and scholarly, and no doubt 
many scholars become such in protest against original 
inferiority. 
In the milder form of compensation we have less diffi- 
culty with the physical than with psychological or social 
elements. Ordinarily the body mak its deficiencies 
to some extent, just as the blind man acquires an advan- 
tage as well as a handicap. We can see that clearly if 
we watch the mental processes of a blind man. It is espe- 
cially true if the blindness came early in life. But when 
it is a question of inferiority of social origin, nature does 
not help. The body can take care of its weakness because 
the body is constructed for that, but society does not auto- 
matically take care of similar psychological and social diffi- 
culties.

he has a small capital of nervous strength and that he ex- 
hausts what he has more rapidly than the normal person. 
Nature can not make up for his excessive activity. Often 
the more work he does, the less sleep he is able to get. The 
result is that he wastes his energy more rapidly than does 
the average person. 
With reference to an inferiority complex of social origin, 
it is not necessary that the feeling be based on actual fact. 
It may be the result of suggestion. The person thinks of | 
himself as having an inferiority, and because he thinks as 
he does he gradually develops the characteristics of a real 
inferiority complex. An individual who falsélystipposes 
himself suffering from heart trouble of a serious s character       
   
may react to his assumption in such a way a: ‘to make his 
imagined _afflietion.the.dominant element i his bear. 
In like manner the belief that one occupies a position 6: 
inferiority will produce social behavior in harmony with 
the status of actual inferiority. For example, one who 
believes himself socially unpopular is likely to shut him- 
self in, to keep away from association as much as possible, 
until finally his aloofnéss and awkwardness and sensitive- 
ness make him truly unpopular and bring him conclusive 
evidence of the fact which he has long erroneously. believed. 
A great many of the famous men of ‘history have been 
interpreted as sufferers from an inferiority complex. 
Luther, for instance, is a striking illustration of strong 
masculine protest against an earlier sense of inferiority.

‘The peasant’s son Luther, the monk, the doctor of phil- 
osophy, with his trenchant pen and his stubborn pride, 
afforded this personality. It is interesting to contrast those 
early years in the monastery during which Luther tor- 
mented his soul with doubts of himself, in which he could 
never convince himself of his purity but continually ques- 
tioned his own worthiness of salvation and gave himself 
over to prayer and fasting, with the later years of firm-

to” ‘Aamir the neighborhood’ or to express her ego-con-

does is the desire to dominate for its own sake. She will 
not be interested in any sort of reform because of its 
social significance, but merely because through it she will 
have another opportunity to dominate. 
So_in family life a good many difficulties originate 
because of feelings of inferiority. Men who are not strong 
enough to dominate anywhere else have an opportunity’ 
to dominate at home. The less self-expression they have 
elsewhere, the more power they claim in the home. “Wit

he never successfully maintains his authority.

others in order to bring about emotional satisfaction. Such 
persons may be capitalists who enjoy the present oppor- 
tunity that the struggle between capital and labor affords 
for a contest; qr they may be labor leaders who in the 
same manner make use of their authority to bring about 
strikes, not to advance the interests of the laborers so much 
as tO satisfy their own inherent craving for power, The 
teacher has an exceptional opportunity to express inner 
feelings of inferiority in cruel dominance. 
It would be for the interest of society if it were pos- 
sible to withhold from men who are seriously suffering 
from inferiority complex such authority as falls into the 
hands of wardens of prisons, officers in the army and navy, 
heads of industrial plants, or men in control of such organ-

CHAPTER XVI 
PHANTASY AND SociAL RATIONALIZATION 
_-~The tendency to phantasy is inherent in human nature. 
The creative power of imagination is made use of as a 
means of hiding unpleasant facts from oneself. The con- 
structions of fancy may replace the actual conditions and 
then they receive the reactions that belong to real things. 
The existing environment is replaced by an imagined one 
and the conduct is adjusted to the fancied circumstances. 
The imagination would be unable to accomplish this seem- 
ing miracle were it not that the air castles are built in 
accord with the desires of the dreamer and therefore have 
come into being as a means of escaping from the hard cir- 
cumstances of reality. Fancy steps in to cater to cravings 
which the person despairs of satisfying by successful 
grappling with the real conditions. Fancy spins a cocoon 
and the soft, flimsy covering of phantasy comes between 
the dreamer and the harsh contacts of his every-day 
experiences. 
Wherever fear has sway the tendency to phantasy is 
augmented. We have countless illustrations in savage life 
of the effect of fear in creating the most diabolical imag- 
inations, which once they are created are passed through 
the group by suggestion until they become realities to the 
people and from a psychological viewpoint are to be taken 
as seriously in understanding the environment that oper- 
ates upon the thinking and acting of the natives as if they 
lwere physical forces of an adverse environment. As is 
commonly known, much of the religious life of primitive 
people is an attempt to propitiate these subjective con- 
231 
 
-P-A-G-E-244
  
  232 PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL ADJUSTMENT 
structions. The thinking of the people is tightly bound 
by the tyranny of their own terror. Leonard’s thoughtful 
study of the primitive tribes of the Lower Niger is replete 
with illustrations of this savage experience. In the follow- 
ing words Leonard summarizes the situation. ‘‘In en- 
deavoring, therefore, to fathom the psychology of these 
people, it is not only imperative that the dualism of their 
nature should be acknowledged, but that the supremacy of 
the spiritual over the human, in other words, of illusion 
or the subjective, as compared with reality or the objective, 
be clearly recognized. For in no other way is it possible 
to understand them. This alone will explain why a people 
who are literal and natural, acknowledging as they do 
the burden of the flesh and the practical value of utility, 
or the substantially useful, should live under the entire 
and absolute control of the non-existent phantasmal. 
Further, it will also explain the seemingly anomalous asser- 
tion that while the supremacy of the latter has certainly 
kept them from relapsing into the depths of decadent 
savagedom, it has at the same time prevented them from ad- 
vancing towards the heights of expanding civilization.’ 
. alt must not be supposed that any trait so universal in| 
human nature is altogether harmful. Phantasy has it 
benign aspects. When reality is too harsh or too exacting. 
the process of phantasy may bring immediate relief. A 
the time of the Halifax explosion many lives were lost a! 
a result of the concussion. One man, returning to his hom 
at night, found all his family dead. He entered the hous 
a sane man. When he stepped over the threshold a fe 
minutes later, he was hopelessly insane. Confronted b: 
an insupportable calamity he had found refuge in lastin; 
phantasy.

  PHANTASY AND SOCIAL RATIONALIZATION 283 
_~Phantasy may become a transition experience leading 
the individual onward to the facing of the actual circum- 
stances eventually. A woman whose son or husband is 
reported missing at the battle refuses to give up the idea 
that he will finally come back even though there is little 
rational basis for the continued expectation of his return. 
The phantasy construction is exceedingly comforting until 
the individual-is equal to the facing of the actual facts. 
Persons that are radical with reference to social experience 
often illustrate the inability to react reasonably to cir- 
cumstances that appear harsh. They become radical 
because in their own personal life they have suffered or 
are suffering from conditions which they do not wish to 
face squarely. Instead of recognizing their own emotional 
disturbance and their own loss of contentment they turn 
their restlessness and dissatisfaction outward and create in 
society a theory of straw against which they can express 
their hostility. Fed as they are by their subjective im- 
pulses, no experience can deaden their enthusiasm and 
no change of social cireumstances will lead them in the 
slightest degree to a favorable attitude. They are most 
happy in finding most fault since by the process they 
relieve themselves from their own inner disturbance and 
generally indeed from their own inner sense of inferiority. 
The child’s phantasies take many forms. They begin 
with his parents and are expressed with reference to the 
relations with father and mother in the everyday life of 
the home. As soon as the child is old enough to construct 
thought at all he naturally imagines himself in situations 
that satisfy his desires with reference to his mother or 
his father. The actual content of these day-dreaming expe- 
riences will depend mostly upon the experiences of the 
child and the kind of fellowship he enjoys with his parents. 
He often thinks of himself as having the exclusive love
-P-A-G-E-246
234 PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL ADJUSTMENT 
of the mother, for example, perhaps in such cases building 
up pictures that remove from him the competition of the 
father. He thinks of himself as having the possessions of 
the father, going with the father to his work, taking part 
in the earning of the family’s livelihood. As soon as he 
begins to read he uses this new resource also as a means 
of adding material for the process of imagination. 
Naturally in such circumstances he reacts immediately 
to unfavorable and unpleasant experiences by removing 
them from his consciousness by the process of day-dream- 
ing. Every student of the child’s day-dream has seen that 
such imaginations center about the ego and are for the 
most part attempts to satisfy the self-regarding instincts. 
The child thinks of himself as not appreciated by other 
members of the family. Perhaps he constructs an imagery 
of death, since he thinks his real worth would then be 
recognized by all, and everyone who has injured him in 
the family life would be repentant and regretful. 
The child also finds recompense for what he considers 
ill-treatment by constructing day-dreams in which he puts 
those who have hurt him into disrepute. He has the hate- 
ful brother or sister thoroughly punished. In this way 
he obtains satisfaction denied him by the actual facts. He 
also turns to day-dreaming to get possession of things he 
lacks. He replaces his poverty by wealth, his restrictions 
by freedom. The wealthy family’s resources become his 
standard. In the same way any want of skill, any sup- 
posed defect, is reacted to by the construction of images 
that make possible the greatest degree of skill, the largest 
possible attractiveness, or whatever appeals to his inner 
eraving. 
_-This tendency to imagery which is so natural to the 
child is detrimental to the adult because it keeps him 
from playing a man’s part in the world. The child, there-
-P-A-G-E-247
  PHANTASY AND SOCIAL RATIONALIZATION 235 
fore, has to be gradually led away from day-dreaming and 
taught in such a way as to make it possible for him to 
face the actual circumstances of life and if possible to 
control his circumstances in order that he may obtain his 
achievement by actually working out his purposes rather 
than merely dreaming about them. 
The child’s development in years and knowledge should 
be paralleled by a similar advancement into reality and 
a giving up of the childish props that assist in the first 
feeble efforts to carry the load of life. The success of 
the child’s education from the world of phantasy to the 
world of reality is measured by the closeness of his fancies 
to life. If the images that float through his mind are 
warm with close contact with the real circumstances, his 
emotional maturity is assured. If, on the other hand, every 
hard fact is reacted to by a retreat into inner consciousness 
where images are constructed to compensate for the harsh- 
ness of factual experience, the youth is in his heart of 
hearts emotionally immature and his childishness is bound 
to prove his undoing. The harder his circumstances, the 
greater his retreat; the more his retreat, the less his suc-_ 
cess in dealing with life; and thus he spins around the 
circle until perhaps as an adult he takes refuge perman- 
ently in some nervous affliction that will relieve him from 
further social responsibility. 
It follows from this that there is risk in the child’s use 
lof fairy tales. There are few children who do not joyfully 
read such stories and delight in constructing them. If 
most children are not given fairy tales in their earlier 
ears they will make them for themselves. The wise par- 
lent from the beginning will teach the youngest child that 
there are two kinds of stories, one representing actual 
act and one, make-believe. By allowing the child to 
hoose which he wishes, a sense of enormous difference     
                             
   
    
    
-P-A-G-E-248
  236 PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL ADJUSTMENT 
between the two types will be developed in his conscious- 
ness. This in itself will teach him the uselessness of look- 
ing to the fairy tale for any permanent satisfaction. It 
will become merely a fancy, a recreation, and as he develops 
he is likely to leave it behind until no story that does not 
suggest life will be interesting to him. Such children in 
the end may come to look upon the fairy story as unin- 
teresting. This is especially true of boys, because they 
are given freedom to contest life in such a way as to take 
away from them any inclination to have recourse to phan- 
tasy for the satisfactions that ought to be attained by 
actual achievement. In so far as the girl’s life is rational 
or free from repressions, the same thing occurs. | 
It must not be thought that any individual is likely to 
free himself altogether from tendencies to phantasy. The 
most mature and well trained mind is likely in its free 
associations to dwell upon experiences that are egoistie and 
of the character of day-dreams. The person finds himself 
thinking in terms of success not yet attained and with 
little thought upon the process of achievement. In so far| 
.as this leads eventually to ambition it is stimulating and 
inspirational. In so far as it is a mere recreational expe- 
rience it relieves from fatigue and in the end incites to 
serious endeavor. When it’ becomes a chronic habit and| 
the individual by this process obtains inner satisfactions, 
it degenerates into infantile day-dreaming, which is alto 
gether unwholesome and detrimental to the welfare of th 
person. In other words, it shows failure to grow up, an 
bears testimony to the inherent difficulty of human natur 
in trying to leave behind all the magic of childhood wishe: 
and buckle down and accept the heroic task of dealin 
with life as life actually is. 
Since one does not like to accept the consequences o 
his own inner weakness, phantasy is tied up closely wit.    
       
       
   
      
       
  
-P-A-G-E-249

PHANTASY AND SOCIAL RATIONALIZATION 287 
the tendency to rationalize. Rationalization is the giving 
of wrong reasons for one’s belief or attitude or action, To 
protect oneself from personal criticism, one is constantly 
tempted to construct a fictitious explanation for the way 
one meets life. A doctor perhaps does not wish to leave 
his comfortable home to become an army physician in war 
time. It is easy indeed for him in such circumstances 
to argue with himself that he is unfit for such service, that 
he is needed in the community, that somebody else should 
go rather than himself, that he would not be accepted even 
if he volunteered. Back of all these reasons is the real 
motive which he keeps out of consciousness. As a matter 
of fact he does not want to go and does not make any 
effort to find out whether he is the one that ought to go 
and whether he would be accepted if he attempted to enlist. 
Sincerity and efficiency demand of us a cutting through 
all of these emotional disguises into the heart of our motive 
where we can come in contact with the honest facts. 
Whether we shall have many or few processes of rational- 
ization bearing up our inner motive is mostly a matter 
of early experience. In so far as a child is trained from 
the beginning to understand the risk of rationalization, to 
that extent he is likely to be free from the process. 
Some years ago a woman who was married most unfor- 
tunately to a drinking, neurotic husband was advised by 
all her friends to get a divorcee, but simply did not have 
the courage to go to the court and make public her suffer- 
ing. She concealed from herself the real cause of her 
decision by affirming that her mother had aiways been 
opposed to divorce and that it would be dishonest to the 
mother’s memory to go to the court. She persisted in this 
attitude even when her husband made attempts upon her 
life. One who knew the mother could not persuade 
himself that she would in any way have countenanced 
 
-P-A-G-E-250
238 PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL ADJUSTMENT 
such an extreme adherence to her views in an individual 
ease of this severity. Here was a rationalization process 
constructed by one who had never had much contact with 
reality, but who in an environment of wealth had been pro- 
tected until marriage from any considerable sense of self- 
responsibility. 
At the beginning of adolescence there is commonly a 
revival of earlier habits of day-dreaming. This is in har- 
mony with the emotional upheaval of this period and shows 
the desire of the child for new satisfactions and new suc- 
cesses, and the failure to get from actual experience much 
the soul hungers for. A turning to the earlier magic of 
thought is the natural consequence. The child spins out 
of consciousness his desires to dwell largely upon expe- 
riences that magnify the self and give the idea of social 
recognition and approval. If for any reason the child is 
particularly handicapped—for example, feels inferior to 
his associates—this turning to the day-dreaming mechanism 
is more pronounced. 
A seven-year-old girl dictated the following story of a 
little girl’s dream as part of a book she was writing. 
*“Dorothy was in the midst of a great field with grass 
all around her and flowers all around her too—you know 
Dorothy loved flowers. She was picking bluebells and 
dandelions, and humming a merry little tune to herself, 
when all the flowers that she had picked turned into cats 
with wagging tails. Dorothy loved cats when she was on 
the farm, but now in her dream she hated them, and ran 
hither and thither, afraid that the cats would catch her, 
climbing trees and jumping bushes—with the cats after her, 
and now and then swimming in brooks, which, of course. 
she could do better than the cats. Although the cats wer 
very smart she kept away from them for most half a 
hour and then she was eaught in the corner of a tree.

Then she said to herself, ‘Oh, I am lost. Why did I ever 
get in the corner of this tree? Oh, Oh, Oh.’ 
“Then, to her great surprise the cats all stood in front 
of her and bowed and said, ‘Mistress, what shall we do 
now? We have done your bidding.’ And she said with 
some surprise, ‘I am not your mistress. You must have 
made a mistake, Mr. Cat.’ Then they vanished, all but 
one, and he said, ‘You said we were not your servants, 
but I want to be your servant; I am tired of my other 
mistress. What shall I do now?’ he said with another 
courtesy-bow. ‘Make me invisible and take me to see your 
other mistress,’ said Dorothy with much surprise. ‘All 
right,’ said the eat with another courtesy-bow, and imme- 
diately she felt as if she were made of paper and all 
thin. Taking hold of the cat’s hand they flew along. And 
there, after they had flown a while, down below they saw 
a throne made of pins and butter. 
**And the cat pointed down and said, ‘That is my mis- 
tress. She is neither cruel nor kind, she is half way be- 
tween, as you will see when I take you down to her.’ Then 
they floated downwards and the cat said to the fair lady 
lon the pin and butter throne, ‘This lady has come to see 
you; she thought she would like to; will you take her into 
your castle?? And the cat whispered to Dorothy, ‘Now if 
she happens to be in the kind spell, she will; if not we 
do not know what will happen.’ And the kind lady smiled 
kindly and said, ‘Certainly, I would be glad to, and she 
ay dine at my table.’ 
“Then Dorothy woke up, and found herself in her own 
ittle room, rubbing her eyes, and she said, ‘Ho, ho, ho, 
hat a funny dream. I must tell Mary and Ned and 
ack.’ And she ran downstairs to tell them.’’

girl who made a hard struggle to meet the realities of 
working life. 
“T am between heaven and earth. I float, as it were, 
on a dream cloud which carries me up at times into a 
glorious atmosphere and again nearer the mucky earth, but 
always on, always on. I see not man, I see not the children 
of man, the big Me lies in my head, in my hand, in my 
heart. I place myself upon the throne of Kings, and tramp 
the dusty road, care-free. I sing to myself and call me 
pretty names; I place myself upon the stage, and all man- 
kind I call upon for applause, and applause roars to me 
as the thunder from the heavens. I reason that mine is not 
inevitable stage-madness which comes to all females of my 
pitiful age; mine is a predestined prophecy, mine is a holy 
design, my out-coming is a thing to be made way for. 
“I bathe myself in perfumed waters, and my body 
becomes white and slender. I clothe myself in loosened 
gowns, silks as soft as thistledown, and I am transported 
to scenes of glory. The even stretch of green, bedecked 
with flowers to match the color of my pale gold gown, is 
mine to dance and skip upon. A lightness and a grace 
comes into my limbs. What joy is mine! I leap and spring 
and dart in rhythm with nature, and music leaps from my 
steps and movements ang before my eyes are men. Men 
and women and children’ with heads bent forward, with 
eyes aglow with wonder, and with praise and love for this 
essence of grace and beauty which*is I. What more, what 
more! I hang upon this idol of a dream, but it is gone. 
The height of happiness-is reached; alas, even in dreams 
there is an end to happiness, the bubble bursts, and the 
dust and noise of éarth come back to me. I shut my 
eyes and ears to these and seek consolation among the 
poor. In dreams I go often among them. With my heap- 
ing purse of gold, I give them clothes and beds to sleep 
 
-P-A-G-E-253

upon, I give them food to nourish them and me, to nourish 
and refresh my fame. But do I give my gold away, and 
does my purse cave inwards? Ah, no! Come to my aid, - 
my imagination, for thou art very real to me today. An 
endless store of gold is mine in banks of state. My name 
is headed on the lists of all, my money does increase even 
as I hand it to these poor. The poor bless me, they kneel 
and kiss my hands. I bid them rise, and the hypocrisy of 
my godless soul bids them pray and in this find restoration. 
“T grow weary as I walk, and truth is even harder yet 
to bear than ever before. I am sad, I have nothing, I am 
noone. But I speak soothingly to myself, bidding me treat 
my hungry self to food, and I promise that the night shall 
be long and the dreams and journeys many.’ 
One of the expressions of phantasy particularly common 
in shi Bigot is identification. Every parent and teacher 
is th éoughly familiar with this tendency. Some years 
ago when Oliver Twist was played commonly in American 
‘ities it was discovered by chiefs of police everywhere that 
he coming of the play was followed by an increase of 
juvenile crime. This was due to the scene in which Fagin 
aught the young boys gathered about him to begin a life 
f theft. Dickens/had pictured the scene so successfully 
hat when it was dramatized it immediately did for many 
oys what the author showed it doing for Oliver. This 
an not be thought of as merely imitation in the ordinary 
ense because in carrying out the behavior of Oliver the 
joys had an emotional satisfaction which was built upon 
the phantasy of identification. - 
The child’s instinctive tendency to hero worship is the 
est known illustration of the human proclivity to the 
hantasy of identification. The child loves to have a fairy

tale told again and again because, although he knows the 
story, as he hears it he goes through the process of identi- 
fication and this brings him an emotional satisfaction which 
the parent often does not at all understand. He is the 
prince, and in his play as well as his dreams follows out 
the experiences suggested as the actor acts his part in 
the play. This identification has its dangerous possibilities. 
Not only may the child act characters or rehearse episodes 
that are physically or morally dangerous, but also he may 
develop identification as a means of fleeing from real life. 
This type of phantasy becomes the favorite for him and 
undermines the strength of the personality although the 
onlooker might suppose that the character was: being 
strengthened by the idealism expressed in the make-believe. 
Our hospitals for the insane present many extreme forms 
of pathological identification. Some personage in history 
is chosen as a fulfillment of the inner cravings of the person 
and by the process of identification the patient lives in a 
phantastie world which makes it impossible for him to have 
any substantial contact with reality. It is interesting to 
find how numerous are the Napoleons, the Washingtons, 
the Lincolns, and particularly the Jehovah identification: 
amongst the insane. 
In later life one occasionally finds the same process organ. 
ized more thoroughly and representing an interpretation 0 
experience which is known as mysticism. A mystic pro 
duces from his own inner life a fictitious world and the 
lives in it so that it absorbs all his interests. It become 
to him more real than what by others are regarded as th 
actual facts. The former reality seems unsubstantial. Th 
beliefs and sentiments that are projected from the per 
sonality are woven together until they form a thoroughl; 
welded system of ideas protected at every point from an: 
contact with the world about, lest such contact prove i 
 
-P-A-G-E-255
  PHANTASY AND SOCIAL RATIONALIZATION 243 
the slightest degree destructive. Mysticism may show itself 
in various forms of experience, as for instance art or 
religion. The latter is perhaps the most common expres- 
sion of mysticism. 
Mysticism usually roots itself in the reaction of the 
mystie from his earlier mistakes. It thus becomes a process 
of atonement. He wipes out his feeling of reproach, the 
self-inflicted disapproval of his conduct or his unexpressed 
cravings, by the construction of symbolic experience which 
hides from him his unapproved purposes and at the same 
time removes the sense of reality with reference to his 
former conduct, expressed or imagined. Thus he rids him- 
self of memories that he can not tolerate without utter loss 
of happiness. A strong character in his place would face 
the facts as they are, look at them squarely, force them 
aside and develop a new program of conduct. The mystic, 
however, is not strong enough to do this. He can neither 
get rid of the past nor carry it with him, so he wins the 
battle by transforming the entire personal life to a new 
realm in which he has dominance by the magic of his 
thinking process. 
The mystic may be driven to his refuge more because 
lof his need of protection than because of his reaction to 
early experience. Finding himself moving irresistibly 
Howard that which is unacceptable to his inner self, he 
uns from the battleground into the territory where there 
re none of the temptations that beset him in ordinary life. 
hus he protects himself from a division in his impulses 
ut at the price of losing all contact with the world as it 
eally is. : 
It must not be supposed that the mystic sits down 
md thinks out his problem and consciously makes a 
ecision. The process is subtle and generally outside his 
onsciousness. It is the outcome of the combination of 
 
-P-A-G-E-256
  244 PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL ADJUSTMENT 
influences that center in his life. Instinct, suggestion, 
environmental pressure, physical vitality and habits—all 
play their part. 
Asceticism is similar to mysticism in that it is either an 
atonement or a protection. It is a milder form of mis- 
interpretation. Unable to maintain command of oneself 
in the midst of tempting circumstances, finding it impos- 
sible to handle with discretion and moderation the re- 
sources that furnish pleasure, the individual makes use of 
asceticism and colors the things desired until they repel, 
while in their place he chooses purposes that normally 
would be unattractive. 
A young woman who had been accustomed to take pride 
in the simplicity of her life chanced to spend a year among 
her English cousins. Unwilling to remain aloof during 
their tea-drinking hours of social fellowship, she found she 
must not only have fellowship, but drink tea with her 
friends daily. Failure to partake in the tea-drinking cere- 
monial itself created a little barrier between the non- 
conformist and the other members of the group. The 
psychic element of good fellowship became linked with 
the physical act of tea-drinking so that soon the American 
had cast aside her Puritanical abhorrence of the use of 
anything in the nature of a stimulant and was drinking 
six cups of tea a day, rather more than her companions. 
After her return to America, our tea-drinker clung to her 
tea pot and her numerous daily cups of tea. One hot 
day in mid-summer, after a long bicycle trip over rough, 
hilly roads, she gratefully imbibed twelve cups of the 
friendly tea. Unable to approaeh even the semblance of 
sleep during the night that followed, she arose at three 
to watch the coming of dawn. A hard day’s work fol- 
lowed, and in the afternoon Miss T fell asleep in the den 
tist’s chair while having a particularly bad tooth filled,        
          
    
   
  
-P-A-G-E-257
  
PHANTASY AND SOCIAL RATIONALIZATION 245 
Her earlier prejudice against tea forthwith returned, rein- 
forced by a consciousness of the difficulty of moderation. 
In a short time, the erstwhile beloved beverage was ana- 
thema to Miss T, so that only with the greatest difficulty 
could she sip a quarter of a cupful, when it would have 
been uncomfortably conspicuous not to have done so. Dur- 
ing the next ten years it is barely possible that she drank 
ten cupfuls, always with the greatest distaste. Then, 
having re-established within herself a feeling of control 
over her own minor actions, Miss T was once more able 
to admit to herself that she liked tea, while at the same 
time she preferred not to drink it often, lest its daily use 
furnish an excitant which she did not need. Thus, after 
exhibiting the reactions of the ascetic in persuading herself 
for so long a period of time that she disliked that which 
she felt she had used unwisely, Miss T finally returned to 
the plane of reality and faced the situation as it was, un- 
colored by her emotional bias. The mechanism which gov- 
erned this trifling episode is characteristic of the pro- 
cedure of the more fundamentally ascetic person in dealing 
with affairs of moment. Fearful of his own powers of 
self-control, or penitently regarding past lapses, he per- 
suades himself that he dislikes that which he really craves, 
and thus obtains a measure of freedom, but at the price 
of discoloring life. 
The ascetic often aspires to moral leadership. This is 
the natural consequence of the attention he receives. Thus, 
he uses what influence he has to bring others under the 
régime that he himself has accepted. He becomes a menace 
socially by his becoming identified in the minds of so many 
with idealistic behavior. The wholesome personality flees 
from the preachments of the ascetic although often feeling 
himself to be a worldling because he could not live up to 
the standards expected of him. 
 
-P-A-G-E-258
  246 PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL ADJUSTMENT 
To prevent the child’s developing either asceticism or 
mysticism wholesome habits of courage must be built into 
the life of the developing personality from the earliest 
years. Although it is impossible to prevent day-dreaming, 
the process itself can be steered toward reality until it 
is gradually left behind by the development of a sense of 
actual achievement. Asceticism and mysticism both illus- 
trate the breaking down of wholesome preparation for life 
in the impressive period of childhood. Naturally the 
neurotic individual is most susceptible. The difference in 
the healthy-mindedness of children has to be recognized. 
The influence of suggestion and training is very great and 
can do all that is possible to protect even the neurotie child 
from such unwholesome reactions to life as are represented 
by asceticism and mysticism. 
In protecting the child against the risks of phantasy we 
must not make the mistake of attempting to suppress the 
imagination. No mental faculty is of greater social service 
than imagination. Nothing ministers to happiness more 
than does vivid imagination. It is therefore unfortunate 
when any educational process decreases the original capac- 
ity of imagination in the effort to keep the child from the 
folly of phantasy. 
The imagination shows itself even in science. The great 
discoveries of science have been largely the results of con- 
structive imagination. All art is based upon a wholesome 
use of imagination and surely the American people need 
more art rather than less. 
A question that always arises in this connection is, ‘‘ How 
ean imagination be distinguished from phantasy?’’? The 
test is a simple one. Imagination deals with life and shows 
toward the world of things and persons a thoroughly sym- 
pathetic and wholesome attitude. Phantasy, on the other 
hand, leads away from lifer~It clouds the world of per-  
-P-A-G-E-259
  PHANTASY AND SOCIAL RATIONALIZATION 247 
sons and things. In the place of things that are or have 
been or may be, it constructs false’ creations that are only 
emotionally attractive and appeal only to the person who 
is trying to shut himself away from reality. Phantasy has 
always the element of deceit. Ruskin somewhere says that 
the artificial flower can not be regarded as artistic since 
it deceives us and we are repelled when we come to know 
that we took it for what it was not. This illustrates the 
nature of phantasy. Its attraction is self-deception. It 
makes the dreamer accept subterfuges for achievement. 
Creative imagination provides a program for achievement. 
It leads to the doing of what has not been done and opens 
up an opportunity for originality. If interpretive imag- 
ination be distinguished from the constructive, its business 
is to reveal the meaning and values of human experience. 
Whether expressed in poetry or painting or affection it 
tries not to replace life but to penetrate life and portray it. 
The normal child usually has enough imagination; it 
needs only direction. To destroy it is to be cruel, for 
from the life is taken a source of power and a source of 
happiness. It must not be allowed, however, to turn toward 
pathological revery. The life without imagination is bar- 
ren. The life with great quantities of phantasy teems with 
noxious weeds that give out poison which sickens the per- 
sonality.

  CHAPTER XVII 
AUTHORITY AND INDIVIDUALITY 
~~ In training the child for life it is necessary to recognize 
\ the existence of two opposite influences of great importance. 
‘ One can be catalogued under the term authority, and the 
\ other under individuali y. One has to do with the self; 
Une other with sotcty/” It is not true, as has often been 
supposed, that the sénse of self appears first and after a 
period of time there follows the idea of others. When the 
child is born, he is necessarily brought into a social envi- 
ronment and it is literally true that the ego world and the 
alter world appear together. The child slowly comes to 
think of himself as a person and as he develops this knowl- 
edge of himself he also realizes that other people about’ 
him are selves also. 
—<—eee"While recognizing the opposition possible between the 
sphere of authority and the inner cravings that represent 
individuality, it would be a mistake to think of these two 
elements as in absolute opposition or as fundamentally 
separated. The self can not develop without contact with 
the outside world, including other people. The growth of 
the self represents a mutual relationship, an adjustment 
of inner disposition and outside stimulation. The influ- 
ences represented by the self and those of the social group 
react upon one another from the beginning. At any time, 
however, in the development of the child, there may be 
a conflict between the outside authority and the inner self, 
making some sort of settlement necessary. As the child 
develops, he responds first to the one sphere of influence 
and then to the other, feeling often in consciousness the 
250

  AUTHORITY AND INDIVIDUALITY 251 
stress which follows an unsatisfactory adjustment of the 
two sources of impulses. 
As a result of this situation, the parent or teacher finds 
himself confronted with three different problems. The 
first represents the need of developing the child’s self- 
expression. Fortunately in our schools child training has 
come to the point where we understand that the goal of 
self-expression is the most important of all the problems 
of education. The child must be drawn out until he 
becomes conscious that his inner self is obtaining the sat- 
isfaction of self-expression. This point of view doubtless 
is the most important contribution thus far made in the 
development of the science of education. To know the 
purpose of education, however, and to be efficient in its 
accomplishment represent two different things. The devis- 
ing of means by which self-expression can be brought about 
is at present the chief task of educational investigation. 
There can not be permanent happiness for the individual 
nor safety for the group unless the ego expresses itself 
in ways that conform to social needs. This calls for a 
socializing of individuality which will not seem to the 
child a suppression of self, but an expression. Unless 
education accomplishes this second task, its success in its 
effort to provide the means of self-expression becomes posi- 
tively menacing from the social viewpoint. 
Complicated as the problem is, the recognition of a third 
obligation becomes necessary. The progress of society 
epends upon the use made of the natural tendencies of 
ersons to vary in their conduct and thinking. The group- 
ife therefore becomes socially stagnant if the individuality 
xpressed is dominated by the social situation to such an 
xtent that it merely echoes the life round about. This 
hird task of education is particularly difficult because it 
0 easily conflicts with the second. The child must be    
   
           
     
     
  
-P-A-G-E-264
  252 PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL ADJUSTMENT 
led to recognize and respect social conditions and traditions. 
At the same time society must provide an opportunity for 
the self to make an individual reaction which may contain 
the germ of originality. The variations produced in the 
training process, when socialized and permitted expression, 
give to social welfare an indispensable basis for progress. 
Those who are responsible for child training must assume 
the task of weeding out from the conduct of children 
undesirable variations that represent egoistic or even patho- 
logical impulses, while protecting from the effect of the 
group’s desire for uniformity those tendencies that later 
may lead to advancement in our social life. 
Every group has within it the fear of change, which 
has the inevitable effect on the individual of developing 
habitual responses to circumstances and as a result mak- 
ing it difficult for him to break his habits and react in 
a novel way to new conditions. This fear of change is 
seen clearly in savage society where the more primitive 
nature of man is more openly expressed and social cus- 
toms in harmony with it are built up. A great part of 
the training the savage child receives has for its real 
purpose the protection of the group from possible inno- 
vations due to the originality and independence of the 
individual as he develops. Even in savage society, how- 
ever, individuality is not altogether suppressed. A spark 
of individuality or variation persists under the most 
adverse circumstances and later flames up. If this were 
not so, savage society would become so static as to lead 
to rapid degeneration and extinction since physical cir- 
cumstances necessarily change and demand social condi- 
tions to some extent in harmony with the changed 
environment. There is, indeed, in savage society a 
relative stagnation which illustrates an excessive fear of 
change.
-P-A-G-E-265
AUTHORITY AND INDIVIDUALITY ~ 258 
The suspicion the savage has with reference to a new 
way of doing things goes so far sometimes as to make it 
dangerous for one to show special aptitude along any line. 
The skillful person is likely to get the reputation of having 
the advantages of magic. His superior skill or good for- 
tune is explained by witchcraft. Leonard tells us, for 
instance, that a fisherman who, while out in the boat with 
his comrade, has a remarkable catch lays up for himself 
stores of evil that may even endanger his life. Upon the 
return of the fishermen, the one disappointed with his 
luck is liable to hasten to the nearest witch doctor to dis- 
cover from him why his friend has obtained a larger haul 
_ than himself. The witch doctor will see to it that the 
suspicion of the fisherman is given food to feed upon 
and thus the former friend becomes an active enemy who 
does his utmost to bring about the death of his fellow- 
worker. 
The problem of adjusting authority and individuality 
must not be conceived of as merely the task of getting the 
young to conform to social regulations. The adult himself 
is a part of the problem. If youth furnishes one element, 
age furnishes the other. If one left to itself tends to the 
abandonment of prudence and the blind pursuance of ego- 
istic. activities, the other if too dominant forbids variation 
and progress. The struggle between the two parties is 
therefore, to an extent, inevitable. Each has something to 
contribute. Neither can be trusted to have full control. 
This adjustment also has to be made in the case of each 
developing individuality as it comes in contact with social 
lcoercions under the control for the most part of parents, 
eachers and relatives. The meaning of this ever-repeated 
ontest has been beautifully expressed in Sir James Barrie’s 
ectorial Address, delivered at Saint Andrew’s University, 
eotland, May 3, 1922.

  254 PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL ADJUSTMENT 
In savage society the process of social control is most 
clearly revealed. On the physical plane it represents the 
penalty of death, or pain through physical punishment. 
On the psychie and social level it is disgrace or separation. 
From early years the child is made to feel the force of 
these two different forms of social coercion. We find the 
bogey man prominent. By stirring up fear in innumerable 
forms the savage parent makes the child passive in his 
submission. For example, the child may be quieted by 
the admonition that some terrible monster will come to 
pick out his eyes if he makes a noise. He may be warned 
against disobedience by the story of the great serpent who 
came out of the sea and caught the boys who had done 
contrary to what was commanded. These coercive influ. 
ences, built upon the instinct of fear, are constantly im- 
pressed upon the child, and it is not strange that he finally 
surrenders his individuality and attempts perfect conform- 
ing to what is expected of him. The savage child also is 
very sensitive to ridicule and public disgrace. This is made 
use of in his training and he is taught the risk of being 
outlawed, an experience which may mean for him greater 
suffering than physical death. 
The modern adult runs the risk of using the same un- 
wholesome process in his eagerness to bring the child in 
harmony with social convention. What he often demands 
is a docility which is contrary to the necessary self-expres- 
sion of the developing child. He can use punishment of a 
‘oaysical sort, often by so doing undermining the courage 
anc. sympathy of the child. On the other hand the appeal 
may oe tc the child’s wish to be in good standing with his 
associates. He may be driven by the fear of public ridicule 
to a slavish submission that in the end will prove dis- 
appointing to the parent, since it will represent merely 
the results of outside pressure. Even if the parent makes
-P-A-G-E-267
AUTHORITY AND INDIVIDUALITY 258) 
no special effort to dominate the child, his very presence 
will, in cases where affection is normally strong, tend to 
make the child imitate him to a considerable extent. The 
child’s attention is necessarily fixed upon the persons 
around him and especially father and mother. He soon dis- 
covers the advantage of having favorable reactions from 
his parents and gradually this becomes a motive of his con- 
duet. In the child that is particularly sensitive this 
dominance of parental authority is particularly great. 
The relationship involves suggestibility. The child nat- 
urally is apt to respond to indirect influence that stimu- 
lates tendencies of his personality leading to reactions 
which he supposes are entirely his own. With reference 
to suggestibility we find two extreme reactions. One child 
becomes the victim of suggestion to such an extent that 
he never develops, but carries through life childish ten- 
dencies and is easily swayed by his contact with dominant 
persons or even as a result of different forms of suggestion 
eommon to modern life such as skillful salesmanship or 
clever advertising. The other type of child develops into 
a rebel. He seeks every opportunity to react adversely. 
Sometimes this childhood habit extends into later life, 
becoming strengthened in the process. The result is an 
lunsocial or even anti-social individual who at the least 
ill be stubborn-minded and constantly antagonistic to 
ocial conventions. 
The impression the home life makes upon the develop- ) 
ng child is necessarily very great. The child looks to the 
arents for assistance in meeting his first difficulties. His’ 
rst pleasures depend on the parents’ codperation. He lives 
in a world that from the first is largely conditioned by 
he personalities of the parents. He depends on them for 
ood and warmth, the very possibility of life itself, dur- / 
g the early part of his life.

As he grows older his dependence grows steadily less 
as his own bodily functions and mental equipment develop. 
It is easy and pleasant for the parents to minister to the 
needs of the helpless baby. Their part becomes more diffi- 
cult as the new individuality begins to assert itself and 
they must stand back and allow the little one to meet 
new situations for himself. Even the tiny baby not yet 
able to sit up alone takes great delight in the things he 
can do unassisted. He amuses himself by adding new 
gurglings and strange little vocal sounds to his repertoire. 
Once he has achieved a new sound, he repeats it many times 
with evident delight. The toys that are brought to his 
attention, the antics of his elders, can not awaken a pleas- 
ure half so keen. Aside from the things grown-ups do 
for him, their presence alone is sufficient to make him 
happy. Soon he finds that an audience intensifies his joy 
in his own activities and accomplishments. 
By the time he is creeping it is easy to see how much 
he would rather do things for himself than have them done 
for him. Once a parent shares the baby’s joy in his mas- 
tery of a new situation, he can find lesser expressions of 
the same satisfaction in the baby’s commonest experiences. 
The baby is excited and impressed with his newly acquired 
ability to creep; in lesser degree he is made happy by 
finding that he can slide from end to end of his little 
bath tub, or turn about in his bath, or roll over in the 
water without help. The young mother usually shares the 
baby’s sense of achievement in every new action, and pro- 
foundly appreciates the importance of his tiniest accom- 
plishments. 
A year or so later, when the youngster’s new achieve-| 
ments crowd thick and fast about the busy mother, she is 
tempted to say frequently, ‘‘No, no, you mustn’t do that,’ 
**Oh, don’t touch that,’’ ‘‘Leave that alone.’’ Tf she giv

him too free a rein, he will run into one danger after 
another, besides making her much extra work, by upsetting 
things about the house. But his nature is more insistent 
than ever in its drive to new fields of action. He wants 
especially to do what he sees others do, and handle the 
tools they use instead of being kept to his toys. If the 
house is kept free of things he can hurt or be hurt by, 
the discipline he must meet is greatly simplified. If he 
has only to learn to avoid falling, to keep away from cook- 
ing and heating apparatus, and to come when he is called, 
he will learn these lessons with much greater sureness and 
quickness than if they were sandwiched in between admoni- 
tions to keep his fingers off things of beauty that appeal 
to him mightily, or the many little things he yearns to 
examine. Fortunately baby can not reach very high, and 
things he must not have can usually be kept out of his 
reach until the more fundamental lessons have been learned. 
If instead of being forbidden to do the many things 
he wants to do and is physically able to do, such as pulling 
tempting articles from places just above his head that he 
may view them more clearly, the two-year-old is helped 
to do the things he wants to do but can’t quite manage 
alone, he is well on the way to personal independence. 
When he wants to help he asks for it clearly by tone 
as well as word. Probably he wants to help mother mix 
the pudding or fold the clothes or make a bed. He surely 
wants to sweep and mop and scrub. It is a mistake for 
the mother to allow herself to think she is too busy to accept 
his help gratefully. He can save the time he takes from 
her busy day by picking up his toys and putting them 
away. But far more important is the sense of satisfaction 
the child gets from his activity. He learns that he can do 
‘what mother does, though not quite so well. Instead of 
struggling against the will of his mother because it opposes
-P-A-G-E-270
    258 PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL ADJUSTMENT 
his desire for a certain activity, he struggles against the 
inadequacy of his own muscles and nerves to cope with the 
situation in hand. He is pleased with even a small measure 
of success, but sees that there is a discrepancy between 
his aim and his result. When he succeeds in doing today 
that which he could not do yesterday, he wastes no time 
congratulating himself on his success, but goes after some 
farther goal. 
Parents who respond to the child’s earliest demands for 
independence are laying the foundation for the youth’s 
normal assumption of personal responsibility. Accustomed 
to coming in contact with the operation of physical laws 
without the intervention of a protecting personality, he 
is the more ready to use his own judgment in regard to 
his conduct. 
Those parents who thoughtlessly travel the road of short- 
sighted indulgence to the whims of their children or them- 
selves may find when their boys and girls reach adolescence, 
or even the years of maturity, that at some snag by the 
wayside a child has been tripped and held up so that he 
ean perhaps never attain full independence. If the parent 
helped the small child whenever he saw the little one en- 
countering difficulties, not waiting for the child’s call for 
help, and not having from the first cultivated the art of 
standing back until the baby had done his utmost unaided, 
the parent was training the child to be dependent. The 
dependent adult is recognized by all to be a person of 
mediocre possibilities, but it is not so commonly under- 
stood that the cause of the dependency of the normally 
endowed adult must be sought in the training of his earli- 
est years. 
As soon as the child reaches school age a new source of 
authority arises, which may conflict with that of the home, 
where again there may from the beginning have been aj
-P-A-G-E-271
AUTHORITY AND INDIVIDUALITY 259 
split in authority between the parents, or a division of 
contradictory authority between parents and grandparents 
or other relatives. ‘he adult is apt to conceive of the 
boy’s or girl’s problem in too simple terms. It is not 
merely a question with the child whether he shall be sub- 
missive to authority, put rather what authority he shall 
accept. 
The boy, for instance, finds himself commanded by his 
parents who may or may not have the same point of view, 
his other relatives who are almost certain not to be fully 
sympathetic to the parents’ program, the school authori- 
ties who necessarily represent a different purpose, officials 
of the law, the church and above all the society maintained 
by his playmates. This last organization, although simple 
in character, is particularly effective in working out its 
authority. The boy may willingly accept the control of 
the gang since this is closer to his own interests and under- 
standing, even though by so doing he finds himself con- 
stantly in trouble with his parents, his relatives, his teach- 
ers, the code of the church and even the police. In such 
a medley of authority it is not strange that the boy is often 
puzzled and clings to the organization he best understands 
land most enjoys. 
Suppose we trace out moral growth as it shows itself mm 
the adolescent boy. We will take a boy who is just arriv- 
ing at self-consciousness. In childhood he has not been a 
‘ull-fledged moral being: his virtue has been mostly obedi- 
nee to adult authority. He has been satisfied to accept 
is parents’ desires as law and in the degree that he has 
one what was expected of him he has felt himself virtuous. 
ow, however, with the coming on of adolescence he begins 
o wonder about some of the things he has been doing, 
bout others which have been prohibited. He occasionally 
iscovers that the judgment of his parents is not acceptable     
                   
          
       
     
    
-P-A-G-E-272
    260 PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL ADJUSTMENT 
to other people of equal intelligence and equal standing in 
the community. He discovers a degree of variance between 
the teaching of his family, his school and his Sunday school. 
He is forced to reflect upon the conflicting attitudes and 
divergent instruction he encounters, and when he begins 
to ponder he becomes self-consciously moral. He now 
begins his effort to value his acts. He can no longer 
merely follow with blind acquiescence the commands of 
others. 
‘When he tries to decide what are the socially valuable 
actions, the things that he ought to do, he finds an unex- 
pected difficulty. His own desires appear to have replaced 
the earlier authority of others and to have taken over the 
determining of what things are socially proper. He does 
not know how to estimate the reliability of his own desires: 
he feels that they are prejudiced. If he follows his desires 
without suppression or criticism he soon finds himself in 
social disrepute, blamed by his associates for what is re- 
garded as selfishness on his part. He may develop a ques- 
tioning of his wishes that will make it difficult for him to 
trust his own judgments. In this case he attempts to find 
somewhere authority that will settle for him problems of 
vight and wrong. 
Suppose he turns to his parents. They tell him dog- 
matically what is right and what is wrong. Their judg- 
ments may be contrary to his own desires. He turns to 
other boys. He finds they have another ethical code, and 
he is still more in trouble. He goes to school and finds 
the teacher has something quite different also. Then he 
goes to church, and the church tells him what is right, 
but teaches him something different from what he wants, 
what his parents want, what the school wants, and he is 
perplexed. Maybe he will go out and do something that 
will get him in contact with the law, and the law very|

harshly will say, ‘‘This is what we want; that is what you 
must not do.’’? And the law may have a different attitude 
from the others—And he thinks; he can not escape 
thinking. 
All these different moral standards are in conflict and he 
awakens to this discovery: that one of the hardest things 
in all the world is finding out what is right. The rest 
of his life—if he is thoughtful and sensitive and does not 
give up the struggle and become dogmatic and narrow— 
he will still be wondering what is right. He will be asking 
other people to help him, and they may help him and they 
may make it harder for him. The things he can not be 
sure about will try his soul. There will be conflict between 
different interests, all of which seem good, but under cir- 
cumstances that permit of no adjustment, no compromise. 
He must do one thing or the other. 
There are, however, various moral levels; and some of 
the difficulty of the boy will be solved if he discovers that 
the valuations expressed in ideas of right and wrong change 
as one travels upward along the scale of moral evolution. 
On the bottom, the least thoughtful and most insistent 
of all standards is the taboo. This is the forceful, 
uncritical, fear-driven and fear-expressing moral code. 
Abundant as we find it in savage life, it is never absent 
from ‘the most highly civilized society. This code can 
not accept investigation lest it lose its power. It repre- 
sents a fear attitude toward conduct, and those who are 
on this low level fiercely resent any attempt to criticize or 
scrutinize their code. All taboo conduct is automatic. In 
the taboo code every decision is final and for all time. 
Progress comes only from collision between conflicting 
taboos. 
But a boy of intelligence discovers that these taboo 
attitudes are not acceptable to many people, who act upon
-P-A-G-E-274
    262 PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL ADJUSTMENT 
a higher level, represented by custom or the folkways. 
_ Here we have social habit coming down from previous 
times, representing to a large extent advantageous reac- 
tions, and always in danger of becoming unadapted to 
present circumstances. The adult forces the child into 
the atmosphere of custom and folkways, and as a result 
the child follows in the footsteps of his elders. The folk- 
ways operate upon individual desire in the same way as 
taboo although not with such strength. 
In custom the element of fear is weaker; and there is 
also a slight possibility of choice. The customs have ob- 
tained their sway by competition and by selection. They 
are frequently remnants of the more useful of former 
taboos and are more changeable than the taboos. They 
come and they go. They permit a certain degree of modi- 
fication, and the boy finds them more liberal, more sympa- 
thetic, more humane than taboo standards. 
If the adolescent boy matures more fully he finds that 
there are people who have climbed to a higher level morally. 
They are reflective moralists. That means that they are per- 
sons who do not say that a or b or c or d is right in itself, 
for they have discovered that there are certain principles 
that stick in the moral realm, and so they say, ‘‘this prin- 
ciple is right,’? and when a conerete problem comes up 
for settlement they try to find out whether or not the 
desired solution is in harmony with the principle. Such 
a principle is our obligation to do unto others as we would 
have them do unto us. Many people there are that can 
never reach this level. The thoughtful, most discriminat- 
ing people in moral behavior, however, always arrive at 
this level of reflective morality. 
There is something higher, much higher, than this. It 
does not remove reflective morality, but goes into a higher 
realm. This is the destiny of morality-development and
-P-A-G-E-275
AUTHORITY AND INDIVIDUALITY 263 
some day morality will be largely lodged at this point. 
It is what we call scientific morals; it is an attempt to 
trace out calmly, without emotion, what are the causes of 
social values and what are the products of moral choices. 
Just as one finds that a certain chemical combination brings 
a certain result, so scientific morality tries to find out what 
follows from certain activities, judges their value, and 
seeks to retain or to renounce the activities according to 
their scientifically determined wholesomeness or unwhole- 
someness. This requires more courage and more thought 
and more discrimination than any other moral judgment 
and is therefore the rarest judgment in the moral world. 
We have had traces of it, however, in very early culture 
and in modern civilization we have it more and more. 
Unless a social group is willing and able to become scien- 
tifically moral it can not hope to meet successfully the 
competition of a group that has the more exacting mor- 
ality.” This is because morality is the most consequential 
element in conduct. Nothing else so colors or motivates 
conduct: If the mistakes of social behavior are moral in 
character they are the most injurious and also the most 
difficult to correct. Therefore a people loaded with errone- 
ous principles of morality or wrong interpretations and 
applications of moral principles has a burden which sooner 
or later crushes social well-being. 
For example consider the moral value of war. Does 
war under modern conditions of social behavior add to 
human happiness and progress? Does it increase or de- 
erease the biological vitality of a people? Does it free 
or cloud judgment? What are its social consequences? 
When these questions and many others are answered posi- 
tively in the spirit and by the methods of science, the 
(1) Bristol, L. M., Social Adaptation, Preface.

rightness and wrongness of war, socially considered, is 
determined and its moral status fixed. 
Is the drinking of alcohol as a beverage a moral question ? 
Is it good or bad? The question at issue is, what is the 
statement of science? Have we scientific evidence that 
demonstrates that it is socially harmful? If science says 
drinking is socially injurious, its morality is settled. We 
then positively know that alcohol is not good for human 
nature. Therefore we must not have it. We must get 
rid of it. There can not be any compromise. The thing 
is not good. 
Is slavery good? No, answers science, not even eco- 
nomically. There can be no discussion of it; there is no 
possibility of argument. It is not good, therefore we can 
not have it without social disaster. 
These illustrations reveal with what definiteness and 
clearness a scientific statement regarding morals can be 
made if the evidence is scientifically conclusive. 
We have at present great need of knowledge regarding 
moral conduct. Once we have this accumulation of demon- 
strated facts respecting problems of social conduct, we 
have the foundation for a morally wholesome society. There 
will still be need of the work of the teacher, the preacher, 
the legislator, the moralist, for knowledge is not habit. 
The social task of getting people to be willing to abide 
by the decisions of science in regard to conduct will still 
remain. Pressure will still need to be exerted upon the 
untrained or the socially indifferent individual. The first 
prerequisite of sound morals is correct judgments. Science 
will be forced to gather the material for such judgments 
since its effort to solve other social problems will force it 
more and more into the realm of morals. 
Can science deal with the problems of morals? There 
appears to be no inherent difficulty. Conduct has social

   AUTHORITY AND INDIVIDUALITY 265 
consequence. Conduct can be defined and classified and 
its results determined. To be sure, a science of morals will 
necessitate a great deal of patient, painstaking effort on 
the part of men and women thoroughly equipped for the 
task of studying concrete moral behavior. In dealing with 
moral conduct science will face all the obstacles that it 
encounters whenever it deals with matters that involve 
human traditions and prejudices. It will need to keep 
within the province of demonstrated truth; it must not 
be tempted to dogmatize outside the area of fact to please 
those who do not appreciate the caution demanded of the 
investigator who by means of observation and verification 
attempts to solve a scientific problem. 
An interesting illustration, familiar to those who know 
the ethical judgments of some rural New England com- 
munities, portrays conduct that needs to be taken from 
the sphere of emotion or tradition and treated in a rational 
manner. It reveals the spirit of scientific inquiry in regard 
to moral questions. A young woman brougut up in a 
family that regards theater-going as wrong, having lived 
her early life in a community where her associates had 
ithe same idea as her parents regarding the theater, finds 
herself in the city with people who go frequently to the 
theater and invite her to go, too, She finds herself in 
conflict.” She wants to go. She can not see that her 
friends suffer from going. She can not, on the other 
and, put aside her earlier prejudices against the theater. 
f she goes, believing she is doing wrongly, she will hurt 
erself morally. If she refuges to go, she will harden her 
rejudices and also suffer by missing social advantages 
he needs, 
Suppose she discovers that the theater, like most things 
in life, has its good and its bad side. If she goes where

-P-A-G-E-278
  266 PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL ADJUSTMENT 
she receives harmful suggestions she will be hurt. If, on 
the contrary, she goes to the theater wisely, she will get 
benefit. At once, going to the theater in itself will not 
be an ethical question. The moral question will be definite 
and conerete. Will this play hurt or help her? Will it 
strengthen or weaken her personality? This question calls 
for knowledge. She will attempt to get facts upon which 
to base her decision to go to this play, to stay away from 
that. Now she discriminates. She is attempting a scientific 
decision. The theater preys upon human weakness. It is 
willing to make good look wrong and bad look right, be- 
cause it seeks profits with no regard to social consequences. 
It also powerfully teaches people to do justly and avoid 
wrong-doing. Sometimes the play mixes up the good and 
bad and caters to both those who seek evil and those who 
desire wholesome instruction. The young woman knows 
that some plays are thoroughly bad and malicious. She 
finds others that appear good, and to these she goes. 
Usually her judgment proves correct. Now her attitude 
toward the theater is no longer that of taboo, or custom 
or moral principles in the abstract; it is a matter of 
rational judgment based upon discrimination with refer- 
ence to concrete conduct, and in some measure repre- 
sents observation, analysis and verification of personal 
experience. 
The level of moral conduct upon which we habitually] 
act is not determined by the amount of experience we may] 
have had. We do not climb up to the rational level by 
merely growing up. Many are on the taboo-level, the cus- 
tom-level or are feebly attempting to apply principles to 
concrete behavior because they have not learned how to} 
test their experiences. Environment, however favorable, 
does not necessarily produce the idea of discrimination an 
the habit of rational estimation of moral values. Th

process is one of actually trying to test experience by 
its results. 
Restrictions that are not made persuasive and compelling 
socially as a result of arguments based upon demonstrated 
facts, popularly distributed, act as repressions and irritate 
more than they control. They create the spirit of rebellion 
and at any opportunity the inner hostility will burst 
out. This is the weakness of reform by legislation. 
Unless the people generally are taught to see the advan- 
tage of the new law the reform is not likely to prove 
fruitful. The public attitude is apt to be that of reac- 
tion to repression. This explains the social reactions to 
the policies of Calvin, Savonarola, the Puritans, and others 
who have attempted to use force rather than education 
to hasten social progress. Such reformers can not wait 
to bring the people up to new standards of conduct. 
They attempt to drive action far ahead of knowledge. 
The crusader runs too harshly against human nature and 
the rebound is usually terrific. Such reformers hinder 
progress. 
Society advances morally by increasing its knowledge of 
conduct and by distributing more widely this information 
in a way that gets it into the concrete decisions of life. 
The first process is one of scientific investigation, the sec- 
ond is that of education. Neither process can succeed by 
itself. We must have knowledge. We also must effectively 
teach it. Moral facts are valuable in the same sense as 
are other facts. They must be gathered from experience. 
They must be tested by experience. They must also be 
used to produce one kind of behavior and prevent another. 
Moral conduct is the highest type of social behavior. It 
conforms to causal law, nevertheless, and can be investi- 
gated, formulated and incorporated in instruction just 
as can every other type of behavior.

As social life develops, moral action becomes increasingly 
difficult. ‘This does not. mean that the primitive life of 
savages has no repression. As a matter of fact savages 
by means of tradition, custom, and taboo, especially, con- 
struct a system of social control which, in the sense of act- 
ing as a check upon impulsive desire, is a greater coercion 
than our own modern morality. But from the viewpoint of 
discrimination, as a process of evaluating conduct with 
- reference to its social consequences, our moral code is get- 
ting more difficult all the time because life is becoming 
so complex. In simple society it is easy to decide what 
to do. The interests of the people are few and clearly 
recognized. The social obligations are equally definite and 
dogmatically handed on from generation to generation. 
With us, however, the most difficult part of morality is 
our necessity of discovering the ethical significance of con- 
duct. , 
We are not able to lean upon authority. We are 
forced for the most part to decide for ourselves what is 
right. We of course have legislative acts and well-estab- 
lished principles to guide us. But most: of our conduct 
falls outside the area regulated by legislation. Our having 
moral principles does not free us from the difficult task 
of discovering their application to concrete problems of 
conduct. We realize from experience how hard it is to 
know what is socially good and so we have to put our 
wits to work when we find ourselves face to face with 
any problem of conduct. We make our decisions with con- 
siderable doubt because we know that we have made mis- 
takes in the past and we wonder whether we may not be 
in error again. 
Thus education begins with the individual and ends with 
him. It uses the resources of a personality born into the 
world with an equipment unlike that of any other and

AUTHORITY AND INDIVIDUALITY 269 
seeks not to destroy this individuality but, to fulfill it. 
Education can not succeed when it standardizes its product 
and attempts to mould individuality into one form. It 
finds variation and it must develop variation. 
Individuality has in the past been developed without 
any sense of social responsibility to such an extent as to 
make many feel that individuality in itself is unwholesome. 
The frontier life of the American people naturally led 
to an excessive individualism and the giving of too little 
attention to the values of codperative relationship. From 
that excess we are apt in these days to recoil. Economic 
impulse in our own time has worked upon the multitude 
to build up a philosophy of life which represents exces- 
sive individualism. In this case we have the desire for 
wealth appearing both as a cause and as a result of extreme 
egoistic individualism. Individuality, thoroughly social- 
ized, remains nevertheless the proper goal of democratic 
education. Democracy thrives upon variation in self-ex- 
pression.) _It. seeks an equality of opportunity which will 
enable each individual to attain his largest possible develop- 
ment. Its emphasis upon personal achievement must be 
tempered, however, by an insistence upon the necessity of 
obedience to social authority. Otherwise democracy degen- 
‘erates into the mob and in the resultant anarchy dominant 
personalities develop oligarchies of control which coerce 
individual attainment under the cover of democratic 
disguise.

    CHAPTER XVIII 
ABNORMALITY AND SociaL Conpuct 
me of the contributions of recent science has been the 
ee. understanding of what has in the past been known 
as abnormal conduct. Psychology, psychiatry and soci- 
ology_in their effort to understand behavior-have joined 
forces, and as a result the sharp distinction that had been 
wrongly drawn between normality and abnormality has 
been erased. Though we still distinguish abnormal conduct 
from normal, we necessarily recognize that one shades into 
the other and the distinction has very little scientific signifi- 
cance. On the other hand it has become increasingly clear 
that the schools can not_carry out their purposes_unless 
they make provision for the differences in human person- 
Children come into the world with varying eapaci- 
ties. It is now possible scientifically to measure these 
variations. By this process of mental testing the school 
ean more accurately value and more adequately develop 
the equipment of the individual child. As a consequence 
it is useless for the schools to carry on their function 
without making use of these new sources of information. 
The Massachusetts Legislature in 1919 enacted the fol- 
lowing law for the purpose of obtaining data regarding 
the mental capacity of the children retarded in the schools 
of the state. 
An Act to Determine the Number of Children Retarded in Mental 
Development and to Provide for Their Instruction 
  Section I. The school committee of each city and town shall, 
within one year after the passage of this act, and annually there- 
after, ascertain, under regulations prescribed by the board of 
272 
 
-P-A-G-E-285
  
ABNORMALITY AND SOCIAL CONDUCT 273 
education and the director of the commission on mental diseases, 
the number of children three years or more retarded in mental 
development who are in attendance upon the public schools of 
its city or town, or who are of school age, and reside therein. 
Section II. At the beginning of the school year of nineteen 
hundred and twenty, the school committee of each city and town 
in which there are ten or more children three years or more 
retarded shall establish special classes to give such children 
instruction adapted to their mental attainments, under regulations 
prescribed by the board of education. 
General Acts, Chapter 277, approved July 1, 1919. 
At a time when children of the lowest capacity were 
receiving considerable attention and little importance was 
being placed upon the variations of capacity in the so-called 
normal children, the terms ‘‘feeble-mindedness’’ and ‘‘men- 
tal deficiency’’ became fixed in popular’ thought. These 
terms are unfortunate because they carry with them sug- 
gestions that mark off the children of lowest capacity 
from the others and lead to a misinterpretation of the 
meaning of variation in intelligence. In carrying out the 
provision of the Massachusetts law an attempt is being 
made simply to discover the mental capacity of the child 
rather than to classify him as feeble-minded. 
A great part of the difficulty that society has had from 
the feeble-minded has been due to its misinterpretation of 
the meaning of feeble-mindedness and its attempt to deal 
with persons of small mental capacity in the same manner 
that it has dealt with those of average capacity. The 
child with a low intelligence quotient can usually do well 
the school work that is within his capacity. What he can 
do, he does as satisfactorily as the average child. He can 
not, however, go beyond his natural endowment. The 
schools therefore have no choice. Either they must be con- 
tent with giving the child of small intellectual equipment 
   
-P-A-G-E-286
  274 PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL ADJUSTMENT 
work that is within his power and of real value to him in 
his life, or they must eliminate him from the school and 
leave him with no training at all for life. It is obvious 
that a child of this sort desperately needs such training 
as is within his power. It has not only been distinctly 
unfair but socially unfortunate that society has so largely 
ignored this kind of child just because he has not fitted 
well into the ordinary processes standardized for the child 
of average ability. The following diagram of Dr. Fer- 
nald’s shows the characteristic working of low intelligence. 
The boy of fifteen years has a mental age of nine years and 
should be capable of doing fourth grade school work. Had 
he been equipped for life with the capacities of the average 
fifteen-year-old boy he would have been able to handle the 
first year of the high school. The school tests show that 
he was able to do fifth grade work in reading ; fourth grade 
writing, arithmetic, spelling, geography and language. 
In dealing with mental deficiency until recently an exag- 
geration has been made of the importance of heredity as 
a cause of feeble-mindedness. No one questions the large 
part that inheritance plays in the bringing of feeble- 
mindedness but nevertheless science has in the past been 
misled by the fact that the authorities who have investi- 
gated feeble-mindedness have been for the most part deal- 
ing with institutional cases. They have assumed that the 
institutional case was the typical one. Naturally the kind 
of child sent to the institution has been the most difficult to 
handle and the one most needing separation from family 
life. This has meant that families carrying feeble-minded 
strain have furnished the larger proportion of the insti- 
tutional cases. Such families have been for the most part 
willing to give up their children. If not, their obvious 
failure to train the child satisfactorily has led the state 
to take the child from them.

  276 PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL ADJUSTMENT 
Necessarily therefore the institutional cases have been so 
predominantly the type representing feeble-mindedness 
through inheritance that investigation merely of institu- 
tional inmates has overemphasized heredity as a cause. 
This sort of low mentality is due to defective germ plasm 
which is transmitted according to the laws of heredity. 
It represents three different degrees of pathological inheri- 
tance. In the one the family strain is so notoriously defee. 
tive as to attract in these days the attention of social 
agencies. These individuals form a little hamlet of indi- 
viduals who intermarry and from generation to generation 
produce children who develop into alcoholics, prostitutes, 
criminals and the insane. Such homes are more and more 
being broken up by social agencies and through segregation 
the family strain is coming to an end. We have some very 
interesting studies of families of this sort, such as the 
Jukes, the Kallikaks, the Nams, the Pineys, and the Hill 
Folk. 
We also have low mentality through inheritance where 
the family strain is not so pronouncedly defective but we 
find perhaps one of the parents or other near relatives 
suffering from feeble-mindedness. Another group repre- 
sents family strains whose ancestral records occasionally 
show the appearance of feeble-minded individuals. Here 
there is a tendency toward defective germ plasm but it 
is not pronounced. 
It is most unfortunate that common thought believes 
that all feeble-mindedness, or nearly all, is caused by defec- 
tive germ plasm. Some authorities state that probably 
only half of our cases of low intelligence are due to in- 
herited tendencies. This means that many of. our indi- 
viduals of low capacity are the result of environmental 
. eireumstances such as early diseases, especially such as 
attack the brain structure; accidents before, at, or after 
 
-P-A-G-E-289
ABNORMALITY AND SOCIAL CONDUCT 277 
birth; or other somatic influences caused by environmental 
circumstances. Birth injury is certainly a large cause of 
brain injury and therefore of mental deficiency. 
In dealing with the problem of low intelligence it is 
necessary to recognize the undue stress that hitherto has 
been placed upon the social value of intelligence. It has 
already been noted that even in testing the intelligence the 
emotional state of the individual tested must be taken into 
account, since any unusual disturbance will lower. the rat- 
ing by impeding mental functions. The more we know 
about the so-called feeble-minded, the more we realize that 
the misconduct charged against those lacking average in- 
telligence has not been merely a matter of limited capacity. 
Personality traits always count in every individual and 
particularly in the case of defectives. 
It is essential that we keep in mind in dealing with 
abnormal conduct the significance of the individuality. 
The misconduct is not necessarily to be explained merely 
by feeble-mindedness or constitutional inferiority. The 
problem of conduct centers about personality itself. This 
has been very well stated by Dr. Nixon in the following 
words: ‘‘John Smith does not loaf around the pool rooms 
and commit petty larceny because he has an I. Q. of 75; 
the real explanation is that that complexity known as John 
Smith reacts differently from a normal individual. This 
is due to his individuality, not to his mental defect per se 
though this may be the most striking feature of his indi- 
viduality. The same is true of individuals termed ‘psy- 
chopathie personalities.’ If a man’s departure from the 
average were in the field of personality or character alone, 
he probably would not become dependent socially or eco- 
nomically. The reason that these people are misfits, fail- 
ures, and criminals is because of abnormalities in more than 
one particular phase of their individualities; in other 
   
-P-A-G-E-290
278 PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL ADJUSTMENT 
words, the individual as an entity is abnormal in his 
reactions—not that there is merely a defect in his intellect, 
emotions, or character.’ 
The community is of course necessarily standardized to 
the normality represented by the class of average intelli- 
gence. Nevertheless the mentally defective have often 
been brought into trouble by the community’s exploitation 
of the defect. As a consequence we find from experience 
that individuals of low intelligence rating furnish many 
recruits to the ranks of the criminal and the prostitute. 
The boy who is treated as a social inferior by his comrades, 
who is necessarily marked in ordinary school activities as 
unlike the rest, who is constantly reminded, at every point, 
of his stupidity, stumbles perhaps upon an opportunity 
to steal and finds himself in this particular undertaking 
apparently successful. He at once finds an outlet for 
his deeply felt inferiority, and thievery becomes a com- 
pensation as well as a means of profit. He also, being 
as a rule abnormally susceptible to suggestion, is not only 
easily led into bad conduct but is exploited by those who 
take advantage of his lesser mind. 
A feeble-minded youth, in a country town where lumber 
manufacturing is carried on, is the chief support of the 
large feeble-minded family of which he is a member. He 
is large and physically strong, patient and kindly. He 
earns a good wage in one of the local manufacturing plants 
where he does simple, muscular work, such as loading or 
unloading heavy logs of wood. Saturday night when he 
receives his pay, ‘‘the boys’’ think it smart to trade on 
his generosity, and week after week the hard-working fel- 
low goes home empty-handed or with a mere fraction of his 
weekly wage. :

ABNORMALITY AND SOCIAL CONDUCT 279 
In a nearby rural district lives a steady, hard-working 
man who is unusually well developed physically, but of 
somewhat less than average intelligence. He earns quite as 
much money as his neighbors, but his wife, whose physical 
and mental capacity diverges even more widely than his 
own, spends the greater part of the family income on 
cheap jewelry for which she pays an exorbitant price. As 
a result this family, including two feeble-minded children, 
and three younger ones who thus far seem ordinarily 
bright, lives in the direst poverty. 
Prostitution, like the career of the criminal, offers com- 
pensation to those unprotected individuals of low intelli- 
gence who are sensitive to their position of inferiority. The 
girl who has in every way been made to realize her infe- 
riority because of her lack of average mentality discovers 
that so far as sex is concerned, to some at least, she is 
attractive. In the association toward which she gravitates 
she is more sought after than the normal girl. As a result 
sex becomes to her a means of escape from her inferiority 
complex. She naturally also has less sense of the conse- 
quences of her misconduct and is much more likely to suffer 
from venereal disease or from illegitimacy because of her 
indifference to results or her inability to protect herself 
from untoward consequences. Therefore our prisons, jails 
and reformatories show a large percentage of the feeble- 
minded. 
It is wrong to forget that this class of defectives repre- 
sents a selection in which social position and economic 
circumstances play a large part. Many of the feeble- 
minded are reasonably protected by the family life into 
which they have come and do not show evil propensities 
in any way different from their associates and relatives. 
In a very illuminating report the head social worker of 
the Massachusetts School for the Feeble-minded states the

results of an investigation of ninety-seven boys, living in 
the community, who were formerly at the Massachusetts 
School for the Feeble-minded, to which they are still re- 
sponsible. The maximum weekly wages earned by these 
different boys according to their mentality are as follows:

The larger number of these boys worked as laborers and 
helpers in factories. Some of them ran simple machines 
and did automatic work that did not require much intelli- 
gence. One, for example, with a mental age of six years 
and ten months, worked as laborer for a contractor, mixing 
lime and carrying a hod and earned $29.70 a week. In 
a family with a number of normal children he was the 
only one working and his money supported the family. 
He came to the Massachusetts School for the Feeble- 
minded at the age of twelve, a quick tempered and excita- 
ble imbecile. When he left the institution at eighteen he 
was quite obedient and to some extent able to control him- 
self. He received at Waverly training for the only kind 
of work he was fitted to do and went emer from the 
school to the job. 
The social attitudes of these well trained boys are par- 
ticularly significant. They were carefully taught to work 
and as a result developed pride in their occupation. No 
matter how simple their job, they did it with painstaking

eare and were not troubled by monotony. As a rule they 
followed instructions explicitly. Their social behavior is 
| particularly encouraging. Few of them craved excitement. 
Going to the movies once or twice a week and an occasional 
visit to the theater entirely satisfied them. They continued 
their interest in baseball, gymnasium work and other ath- 
leties, especially swimming. Their evenings were usually 
spent at home and in harmony with their institutional 
habits nine o’clock generally found them in bed. In the 
investigation of the behavior of these boys the most strik- 
ing fact is their desire to be like others, to be thought of 
as ‘‘somebody.’’ Coming as most of them did from poor 
homes, they had felt before entering Waverley the sense 
of inferiority that accompanies low intelligence unprotected 
by economic advantage. They reacted immediately to a 
little attention and recognition. As far as possible they 
kept their fellow workmen from knowing their previous 
history. Running through their social behavior is the per- 
sistent desire to be and act like others. Their social his- 
tories indicate that persons of low intelligence may under 
certain circumstances suffer as much from the emotional 
consequences of their variation, when unassisted, as from 
inherent defect. 
The epileptic child often suffers the same social infe- 
riority that has in times past been so frequent amongst the 
feeble-minded. When epilepsy prevents the child’s con- 
tinuing in school, a great handicap is added to the original 
influence of the disease. The epileptic child is naturally 
exceedingly sensitive and reacts occasionally in forms of 
misbehavior which are the psychic expressions of the physi- 
eal disorder. He can be helped by favorable conditions 
and proper medical assistance and as a result of good treat- 
ment he may eventually return to school or finally enter 
successfully some vocation.

     282 PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL ADJUSTMENT 
A boy of six was conspicuous at school for his mental 
brilliancy. He easily did the best work in a large class 
of bright third-graders, and had much leisure time at 
school, which he spent in reading fourth and fifth grade 
books. He could probably have done the fourth grade 
work without difficulty, had he been placed according to 
ability regardless of age. Rather small for his age and 
very slight, he was nevertheless the best baseball pitcher 
in the school, though several of the seventh and eighth 
grade boys were very good except in comparison with the 
little fellow. When he was not playing baseball, he was 
reading the newspaper accounts of the big league games, 
or studying out for himself fine points about the game. 
Already at six years B. was a personage in the community, 
but he was always extremely sensitive and usually very 
shy. In his seventh year, he developed epilepsy and had 
to leave school. Before the year was out he committed 
suicide in a most spectacular way. 
A student of human conduct is continually impressed 
with the social significance of the group of persons suffer- 
ing from psycho-neuroses. Although science has made 
great headway in understanding psycho-neuroses, they are 
particularly difficult to define. In regard both to their 
origin and their treatment there are at present various 
schools of thought. A serviceable classification divides 
psycho-neuroses into cases of neurasthenia, psychasthenia, 
hysteria, and anxiety neurosis. It is assumed That all four 
classes have no pronounced organic cause. The psycho- 
logical factors involved are supposed to be ee respon- 
sible for the patient’s situation. 
Neurasthenics are, from the point of view of the lay- 
man, persons who imagine themselves ill when they are 
not. They complain of all sorts of symptoms, are easily 
fatigued and react excessively to. stimulation.  
-P-A-G-E-295
ABNORMALITY AND SOCIAL CONDUCT 283 
Psychasthenia represents the condition of those who are 
constantly worrying and doubting, who can not meet with 
promptness the ordinary decisions of life, and who find 
themselves in difficulty when they try to think their prob- 
lem through. 
The hysterics suffer from numerous symptoms charac- 
teristic of various diseases, but without having evidence 
of the disease itself. Thus they have paralysis or blind- 
ness or speech defect although in every case the difficulty 
has a nervous origin. 
The anxiety neurosis is the condition of chronic anxiety 
and fear which characterizes the emotional life of the 
patient and at any time may dominate consciousness. 
The neurotic child is the father of the man in a very 
definite sense. As we dig into the childhood of the neurotic 
adult we discover in the earlier years tendencies leading 
to the result that finally became the climax of the develop- 
ment of the personality. The neurotic child is a problem 
in the home and in the. school. He requires special atten- 
tion for he frequently has a weak body and as a conse- 
quence has a tendency toward lack of confidence. On the 
other hand he is equally prone to selfishness and will take 
advantage of any opportunity given him to claim more 
than his reasonable share of the family or school attention. 
He therefore becomes a difficult problem since he can easily 
be made to suffer from too little attention or too much. 
He is intermittent in his emotional reactions, often very 
shy and sensitive, occasionally however acting in a way 
that suggests rudeness and even audacity. Probably train- 
ing does as much for him as it ever accomplishes in deal- 
ing with human nature in the process of being made. 
A very brilliant boy of ten, weak physically though of 
fairly healthy appearance, had acquired in the community 
the a of being a thoroughly bad and altogether 
 
-P-A-G-E-296
  284 PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL ADJUSTMENT 
incomprehensible boy. The only child of a sickly widow, 
he held the center of the stage at home. At re and 
abroad, among his neighbors, he was either the central 
pivot for all eyes, or he moped, thoroughly miserable. He 
reveled in showing the superlative goodness of his nature. 
He dispensed liberality with a lavish hand, made enormous 
sacrifice eagerly, and basked in the supposed adulation and 
the certain surprised attention his behavior evoked. He 
wrote ‘‘poetry’’ which his mates thought good, and he 
thought remarkable. At the most solemn or important 
gathering -he came forward with some astounding state- 
ment uttered in a portentous tone. When unable to 
command excited attention from all beholders by legiti- 
mate means, he devised heartless plans for bullying 
younger and more ingenious boys, tantalizing his victim 
by keeping himself hidden at a safe distance, perhaps 
in a tree-top, while he hurled taunts and insults with 
well-aimed stones at the little fellow he sought to terrorize. 
His attacks were directed chiefly against boys of stronger 
body than himself, even though they were not so old. 
When alone he would recite original or remembered poetry 
in a loud and sonorous voice, enjoying the sound of his 
voice at least as much as the poem itself. On the slightest 
provocation, or the miscarriage of one of his plans for doing 
mischief or getting attention in any other way, he would 
dissolve into tears accompanied perhaps by proclamations 
of his wickedness or abject grovellings of supposed repent- 
ance. Honeyed phrases and suave flattery were habitual 
+ with him. He treated superiors and strangers with extra- 
ordinary politeness which had the desired — of making 
him conspicuous among his fellows, and usually resulted 
in his being in turn treated with more than the usual 
amount of courtesy accorded to small school boys in a 
manufacturing community.
-P-A-G-E-297
  ABNORMALITY AND SOCIAL CONDUCT 285 
The most useful thing to keep in mind in dealing with 
the neurotic child is the fact that his difficulty represents 
the collision between the egoistic instinctive life and the 
social environment. He feels on the one side the urge 
of personal desire and on the other the pressure of the 
social environment. Having an exceedingly sensitive 
organism he reacts excessively to the stimulations of his 
environment, and especially does he react with fear. This 
underlying fear colors all his doings and makes it impos- 
sible for him to commit himself whole-heartedly to the 
ordinary tasks of life. He is always tempted to run away 
from reality and find refuge in the home, especially in 
the affection of his parents. Thus the neurotic child strik- 
ingly portrays the working of unconscious conflict. In so 
far as the child can be made to understand the meaning 
of his tendencies to flight and taught to deal effectively 
with actual conditions, he can be saved from the neurotic 
breakdown of adult life. Intelligent training may turn 
the neurotic into a very efficient and useful citizen who 
is able to overcome inherent weakness as a result of his 
eareful preparation for life, his good habits and his sensi- 
ble hygiene. 
A group of individuals particularly difficult to define is 
known as the constitutional psychic inferiority type. They 
represent persons emotionally unable to deal adequately 
with life conditions. Frequently they have a high degree 
of intelligence. Emotionally unstable, however, they are 
unable to make good use of their intellectual capacity. 
Dr. John W. Visher has given a very serviceable definition 
of this peculiar type of person in the following statement. 
“From the psychological standpoint, the constitutional 
psychopathic inferior presents marked inherent defects in 
volition and inhibition, together with a lowered threshold 
for and a disproportionate response to implicit and explicit
-P-A-G-E-298
  286 PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL ADJUSTMENT 
stimuli. There is also a lack of balance in ie various 
hereditary and acquired reaction patterns and habit sys- 
tems. The individual is unable to adjust to his inade- 
quacies, either by means of experience or by the formation 
of compensatory modes of reaction. From the behavior- 
istic standpoint, the condition is characterized by marked 
egotism, impulsiveness, poor judgment, nonconformity to 
ethical and social standards, and inability to adjust to or 
to profit by discipline.’’™ 
The constitutional psychopathic inferior can not hold 
with persistency any course or effort long enough to become 
successful.. He naturally drifts about. In industry he 
becomes the type that moves from job to job, always dis- 
satisfied and never efficient. The desire to move about 
frequently turns him into the hobo and vagabond. His 
lack of inhibition tends to make him guilty of crimes of 
passion. He easily becomes alcoholic, a drug addict or 
a sexual pervert. Never able to get any unde standing of 
himself, he blames others for the consequences of his own 
misdoing. He is especially irritable when he suffers from 
his mistakes, and naturally puts the blame on ‘his parents, 
associates or anyone who has had authority over him or 
upon whom he ean by persuasion place responsibility. 
Egoistie and vain, he may become a fanatic, lace or 
the most extreme sort of radical. He is particularly likely 
to develop eccentricities and adopt unreasonable beliefs. 
He has little conscience and is willing to lie or steal in 
order to accomplish his egoistie purposes. He often 
becomes a quack or charlatan. Public a. little 
impression upon him. It is not surprising therefore to 
find that he does not profit from prison sentence and that 
he not only furnishes a large number of first admissions

to penitentiaries but forms a still larger proportion of 
recidivists. 
The following case represents an unusually interesting 
pathological liar and swindler type. More than a decade 
ago a young man of winsome personality appeared in an 
eastern manufacturing city where he immediately won the 
confidence of scores of serious minded citizens, and took 
a prominent part in a series of meetings being held by 
a group of progressive thinkers. He was a fluent speaker 
of great personal magnetism and lively imagination, whose 
presence in the community was considered a great asset 
by his admirers. He became a frequent visitor at the 
home of a clergyman in a nearby village. He won the 
heart of the seven-year-old by his singing and playing 
of fanciful little songs; the high school girl drank in his 
tales of stealing jam when he was a boy in England, and 
vivid accounts of the doings of his mother and sister as 
militant suffragettes in London. The clergyman himself 
spent happy hours in discussing the problems of humanity 
with his brilliant guest. Even the clergyman’s wife, a 
reserved Englishwoman who naturally distrusted loqua- 
cious strangers, fell under the spell cast by the meteoric 
newcomer. The clergyman plied him with his rarest and 
most treasured books, which he insisted on the English- 
man’s carrying to his lodgings that he might enjoy them 
at leisure. In less than a month the favorite was arrested 
in the midst of a fervent oration he was delivering before 
a large gathering in the city. He was wanted on charges 
of swindling numerous persons in several distant cities. 
He was an American, had no sister, and his mother had 
never been in England nor taken part in any suffragette 
demonstration. At,the time the police intervened his bags 
were found packed ready for another flitting. In the bags 
were various articles more or less valuable, which his new 
 
-P-A-G-E-300
288 PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL SEEN 
friends had lent him. He had also borrowed sums of 
money in varying amounts from nearly everyone who liked 
him. After the trial he was committed to a psychopathic 
institution. 
The child who finds himself afflicted by constitutional 
inferiority has a task on his hands. Do his utmost, he can 
not accomplish his purposes. The unsound personality in 
spite of the most careful training shows its weakness and 
finally brings upon itself discomfort and even disgrace. 
It is not strange therefore that we find so many of these 
individuals committed to private asylums where they are 
protected by careful supervision from becoming a nuisance 
or injury to their relatives and friends. Doubtless science 
will more and more investigate these emotionally unstable 
personalities and will obtain a better insight into a defect 
which in the emotional sphere parallels the lack of intelli- 
gence found amongst the feeble-minded. 
Everybody knows that people suffering from what in 
the past has been known as insanity behave irrationally 
and even in a way that is anti-social. Insanity represents 
a legal classification and merely denotes that a person 
suffering from a serious mental disease is legally irrespon- 
sible for his acts. Science is now trying to Timit the use 
of the word insanity to the legal field and in its place 
establish the term mental disease. The mental disease rep- 
resents the most serious form of abnormality and must be 
clearly distinguished from the types of abnormal conduct 
previously discussed. Conduct is tremendously influenced 
by serious mental disease. This fact is generally known, 
but in dealing with everyday experiences it is often for- 
gotten. Our attention should be drawn to the unusual 
and peculiar irrational conduct of someone whose previous 
behavior we know to be in sharp contrast to this. In 
such cases we should be suspicious of mental disease   
  
  od
-P-A-G-E-301
         ABNORMALITY AND SOCIAL CONDUCT 289 
and if possible should bring about the examination of the” 
sick individual by an expert. It is most important that 
it be generally known that mental disease is a real disease 
in the same sense as physical disease, and that we should 
take exactly the same attitude toward it. Indeed, as a 
rule, the sufferer is afflicted with both physical and mental 
disorder. In other words, the mental disorder has a physi- 
eal origin. In any case it is not a problem for the layman 
to handle. It demands the expert attention of a specialist 
in mental disorders and no one else should try to deal 
with conduct of this sort. 
Topics ror Discussion 
1. What is abnormal conduct? 
2. What are the causes of feeble-mindedness? 
3. What has led to the emphasis on the institutional type 
of the mentally deficient? 
4. How have the feeble-minded been led into crime? 
5. What influence has economic condition upon the behavior 
of the mentally deficient? 
6. What are the social attitudes of the well-trained mentally 
deficient youth? 
7. What social motives influence the conduct of the well- 
trained mentally deficient youth? 
8. How should society treat the epileptic child? 
9. What is meant by psycho-neurosis? 
10. How does childhood experience influence the development 
of neurosis? 
11. How should the teacher treat the neurotie child? 
12. How can the school discover the neurotic child? 
13. What is meant by the constitutional psychopathic inferior? 
Topics FOR REPORTS

THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
DEATH OF MRS. JOHN D. ROCKEFELLER 
By the death of Mrs. John D. Rockefeller 
(Laura S. Rockefeller), which occurred at Tarry- 
town, New York, on March 12, 1915, the 
Rockefeller Foundation lost one of its honored 
Founders, for Mrs. Rockefeller’s gift of June 
7, 1913, was practically simultaneous with her 
husband’s first direct gift to the Foundation 
after its incorporation; and her confidence in it 
as the guardian of trusts that were dear to her 
was shown by three more gifts during the same 
year. After her death, her executors, acting 
within the discretion given them by her will, 
and in accordance with her known wishes, 
allotted to the Rockefeller Foundation from the 
residuary estate a fifth large gift for the general 
purposes of the Foundation, thus constituting 
an unrestricted fund which, whether preserved 
as endowment or applied outright to beneficent 
purposes, will commemorate the gentle and 
kindly spirit of the giver. 
FUNDS RECEIVED 
The donations to the Rockefeller Foundation 
amounted on January I, 1915, to $100,073,000, 
of which $100,025,000 represented gifts from 
Mr. John D. Rockefeller and $48,000 gifts from 
Mrs. Rockefeller. These funds were increased 
during the year by a gift from Mr. Rockefeller 
7

of $12,000 par value consolidated 5 per cent. 
gold bonds of the Canada Southern Railway 
Company,’ the income of which is to be paid 
at the discretion of the Foundation to the Bap- 
tist Home for the Aged of New York City, and 
by a gift from the executors of Mrs. Rockefeller 
of securities valued, with accrued interest, at 
$340,873, making the total donations received 
by the Foundation since its establishment 
$10,425,873.” 
EXPENDITURES 
The expenditures of the Foundation through 
its own organizations and by gifts or pledges to 
other agencies during the year 1915 (excluding 
expenditures on account of pledges made in 
former years) may be summarized as follows:

ACTIVITIES OF THE YEAR 
The activities of the Foundation have been 
divided during the past year, as before, into 
two main branches. The first comprises the 
work carried on by the Foundation through its 
own subsidiary organizations or agents, namely, 
The International Health Commission, 
The China Medical Board, 
The War Relief Commission,’ 
The Director of the Investigation of In- 
dustrial Relations. 
The second branch of the Foundation’s activ- 
ities consists of its gifts to other agencies, a list 
of which will be found in the Treasurer’s Re- 
port.” Under this heading are also included 
certain gifts for charitable objects designated 
by Mr. John D. Rockefeller in accordance with 
the terms of his letter of gift of March 6, 1914, 
such objects being invariably approved by the 
Trustees or the Executive Committee as being 
consistent with the corporate purposes of the 
Foundation.   
1Under this heading are included certain contributions to war relief 
through unaffiliated agencies.

10 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
OFFICES OF THE FOUNDATION 
On January 6, 1915, the offices of the Founda- 
tion were established on the twenty-seventh 
floor of the Adams Building, 61 Broadway, New 
York City, nearly the whole floor having been 
secured for the use of the Foundation and the 
General Education Board. In April the head- 
quarters of the International Health Commission 
were moved from Washington to the space 
assigned to them in the offices of the Founda- 
tion, and the administrative facilities of the two 
organizations were consolidated. 
The rapid growth of the foreign work of the 
International Health Commission, necessitating 
an increase in the facilities for bookkeeping, cor- 
respondence, purchasing, etc., soon made it 
evident that the business side of the Founda- 
tion’s organization should be expanded to meet 
the new needs. Accordingly, the office of 
Comptroller was created and the services of an 
engineer, Mr. Robert H. Kirk, were secured in 
that capacity. By vote of the Committee, 
acting with the advice of Messrs. Price, Water- 
house & Company, Chartered Accountants, the 
Comptroller was charged with the duty of keep- 
ing the detailed accounts of the appropriations 
and disbursements of the Foundation, leaving 
to the Treasurer the custody of the securities 
and the drawing of checks upon duly authorized 
vouchers, with only the bookkeeping incident

to these latter operations. By these changes 
the Treasurer and Assistant Treasurer have 
been given more time to assist the Finance Com- 
mittee by presenting the information needed in 
the care of investments; and, in accordance with 
approved usage, the function of keeping the 
books has been separated from that of collect- 
ing and paying out the income. At the same 
time, the Comptroller is of assistance to the 
executives in supplying the bookkeeping in- 
formation that is currently needed, while he 
also furnishes a check upon their expenditures 
by keeping track of the limits set by budgets or 
other authorizations. 
INTERNATIONAL HEALTH COMMISSION 
The Annual Report of the Director General 
of the International Health Commission makes 
an impressive exhibition of the extensive activi- 
ties of the Commission in the relief and control 
of hookworm disease in the United States 
and foreign countries. During the year 1915 
the work was actually in progress in Antigua, 
British Guiana, Dutch Guiana, Grenada, St. 
Lucia, St. Vincent and Trinidad in the West 
Indies; in Costa Rica, Guatemala, Nicaragua 
and Panama in Central America; and in Egypt 
and Ceylon. In addition plans were made and 
a budget adopted for the extension of the work 
to Salvador, British Honduras and the Sey- 
chelles Islands. In the Federated Malay States 
 
-P-A-G-E-12
  12 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
a special commission was at work to determine 
the rdle of hookworm disease and malaria as 
factors in the marked debility of the popula- 
tion. In Hunan, China, an investigation into 
the prevalence of hookworm disease was carried 
on. An investigation of medical education and 
public health in Brazil was determined upon. 
Plans were formulated and budgets adopted for 
experiments in the relief and control of malaria 
in two of the Southern states, Mississippi and 
Arkansas, the object being to ascertain whether 
methods of intensive attack analogous to those 
which have been successful in the suppression 
of hookworm disease might be applied to the 
control of malaria, a disease which, taking the 
world as a whole, is probably the Heeviest handi- 
cap on the welfare and economic efficiency of 
the human race. 
In codperation with the government of the 
Philippine Islands, arrangements have been 
made for the equipment of a hospital ship to 
serve as a travelling dispensary in the islands 
of the Sulu Archipelago, with the object, first, 
of bringing medical relief to a population which 
entirely lacks such resources; second, of making 
the inhabitants of these islands more amenable 
to civilizing influences, a result which previous 
experience with some of the wildest tribes in 
the Philippine Islands has shown to be pos- 
sible; and third, of developing a kind of medical 
service which, if successful in the Sulu Archi-
-P-A-G-E-13
INTERNATIONAL HEALTH COMMISSION 13 
pelago, might not only be taken over by gov- 
ernmental agencies in the Philippine Islands, 
but also be capable of almost unlimited exten- 
sion among the innumerable islands of the East 
Indies and the South Pacific. 
Under the inspiration of the success which has 
attended the efforts of the United States to 
eradicate yellow fever from Cuba and Panama, 
a work the indirect result of which has been to 
protect the southern United States and Central 
America from the danger of recurrent epidemics, 
the International Health Commission decided 
to study the feasibility of eradicating the 
disease from the remaining endemic foci. A 
Commission was accordingly appointed to as- 
certain the number and location of these foci 
and to inquire into the possibility of ridding 
them of infection. The Commission, consisting 
of a number of trained sanitarians experienced 
in yellow fever work, under the chairmanship of 
General William C. Gorgas, Surgeon General of 
the United States Army and a member of the 
International Health Commission, did not begin 
its labors until after the period covered by the 
present report. 
The significance of the extensive and varied 
activities of the International Health Commis- 
sion is to be found not in any expectation that 
the organization and funds at its disposal can 
complete the task of controlling or eradicating 
the formidable diseases to which its attention
-P-A-G-E-14
4 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
has been given, but rather in certain character- 
istic policies to which the success attending the 
previous work of the Commission may be at- 
tributed. The first of these policies is that of 
working through governmental agencies, both 
state and local, and in codperation with the 
medical profession, public schools and other 
social agencies; in other words, through those 
agencies which the people regard as their own 
and on which the ultimate responsibility must 
inevitably rest. The second is that of relying 
upon popular education and on stimulating the 
interest of the common people rather than upon 
official exhortation or legislation to enforce the 
therapeutic and hygienic measures essential to 
the public health.. The third, which is a more 
recent development of the experience of the 
International Health Commission, has been that 
of demonstrating in a limited area in each coun- 
try the feasibility of bringing the disease in 
question under complete control, by the inten- 
sive cooperation of all the agencies concerned. 
By showing that it is possible to clean up a 
limited area, an object lesson is given, the benefit 
of which is capable of indefinite extension. The 
fourth policy is that of laying constant emphasis 
on the necessity of keeping the cost of the work 
down to a point so low that the feasibility of 
maintaining the work out of the available 
public and private resources will become ul- 
timately even if not at first apparent. A
-P-A-G-E-15
INTERNATIONAL HEALTH COMMISSION 18 
philanthropic agency amply endowed might go 
into a community and by lavish expenditure 
benefit a certain number of individuals; but if 
such benefit were conferred at a cost beyond the 
reach of similar communities throughout the 
country, the results would be of slight value as 
compared with those achieved by a policy of 
intelligent economy. The resources of the largest 
private endowments are insignificant in amount 
as compared with the aggregate cost of the com- 
munity’s physical and social betterment. The 
highest service that private endowments can ren- 
der is therefore to furnish by invention, initiative 
and experiment, a demonstration the effect of 
which may be to determine, to a very large ex- 
tent, the direction in which the infinitely greater 
resources of the community shall be applied. 
In the case of hookworm disease and yellow 
fever, the technique of control has been estab- 
lished upon a reasonably satisfactory basis. 
What is chiefly needed is the extension of meth- 
ods already known and successfully applied. In 
the case of malaria, while methods of treatment 
and control can be effectively applied under 
ideal conditions, it is still necessary to discover 
whether the various known measures, such as 
quinine treatment, screening and drainage oper- 
ations, can be effectively employed, separately 
or in combination, at a cost which will not be 
prohibitive in those communities which suffer 
most from the disease.
-P-A-G-E-16
16 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
The testimony of the Immigration Depart- 
ment of Trinidad, that the economic efficiency 
of the laboring population in the area in which 
the work of the International Health Commis- 
sion was carried on has been increased in one 
year by more than twenty per cent, measured 
in hours of effective labor, would indicate that 
the known economic results of such public health 
work would justify increased expenditures. It 
must be remembered, however, that the ex- 
pectation of economic, as well as physical benefit 
is one which makes large demands on the faith 
of a disease-ridden people, and that a scale of 
expenditure which might eventually justify itself 
might, as a matter of fact, be prohibitive at the 
outset. It is at this point that a private agency 
is able to do its greatest service. 
Not the least valuable results of the work of 
the International Health Commission are to be 
found in its effect on other diseases incident to 
unsanitary and unhygienic living. The sanitary 
improvements that are brought about by the 
hookworm campaign tend to diminish typhoid 
fever and other intestinal diseases. Moreover, 
a public health administration that has been 
organized or re-animated to deal effectively with 
hookworm disease has in that very process be- 
come a more efficient protector of the com- 
munity against all other diseases susceptible of 
control. 
The report of the Director General properly 
 
-P-A-G-E-17
MEDICAL WORK IN CHINA v7 
lays stress upon the policies and aims which 
are the subject of the foregoing observations. 
It is, however, a source of profound gratification 
that the personal ministrations of those who 
have codperated with the Rockefeller Sanitary 
Commission and its successor, the International 
Health Commission, in actual contact with 
hookworm disease in the field, have reached 
1,462,726 individuals who have been micro- 
scopically examined, of whom 534,215, or 36.5 
per cent, have been found infected. To have 
improved the health and increased the eco- 
nomic efficiency of a large proportion of those 
found to be infected is a service which amply 
justifies the money and effort expended, to say 
nothing of the more far-reaching and permanent 
results which will follow from this achievement 
regarded as a demonstration. 
MEDICAL WORK IN CHINA 
The Annual Report for 1914 gave an account 
of the inquiries made by the China Medical 
Commission of the Rockefeller Foundation in 
regard to the needs of medical education and 
public health in China, and recorded the estab- 
lishment of the China Medical Board for the 
purpose of carrying out the recommendations 
of the Commission. The first Annual Report 
of the Director of the China Medical Board is 
appended to this report. 
As the plans of the Foundation for work in 
China were based upon the medical work already
-P-A-G-E-18
18 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
carried on by the missionary societies of the 
United States and Great Britain, and were 
actuated by a desire for the most sympathetic 
codperation with these societies, the President 
of the Foundation addressed to them, under 
date of March 15, 1915, a circular letter giving 
an official assurance of this desire. The letter 
stated that, in carrying out its plans, the Foun- 
dation might find it desirable: 
“1, To assist Missionary Societies to strengthen 
their medical schools and hospitals by providing 
equipment and other facilities and by making 
annual grants, as may be found expedient, for the 
support of physicians and nurses selected by the 
respective Missionary Boards, subject only to the 
Foundation’s approval of the professional quali- 
fications of the appointees. 
“2. With the consent of the Missionary Boards, 
to reorganize and expand existing medical schools, 
with their hospitals, and to support these, wholly or 
in part, from its own funds. 
“3. To aid other medical schools that are not 
strictly missionary. 
“4. Toestablish, equip and support new medical 
schools and hospitals. In choosing its agents, 
physicians and nurses for independent schools or 
hospitals, the Foundation will select only persons 
of sound sense and high character, who are sympa- 
thetic with the missionary spirit and motive, who 
are thoroughly qualified for their work profession- 
ally, and who will dedicate themselves to medical 
ministration in China. Beyond these qualifications, 
the Foundation cannot properly impose tests of a 
denominational or doctrinal nature, such as are 
deemed desirable by Missionary Boards for their 
own medical missionaries or agents.”
-P-A-G-E-19
MEDICAL WORK IN CHINA 19 
The Foundation has been gratified by the 
cordial reception given to these expressions of 
its intentions, and still more by the codperation 
which has marked the inauguration of its work 
during the past year. 
Among the recommendations made by the 
China Medical Commission were the following: 
“First, that the first medical educational 
work organized should be in the city of Peking and 
that it be in connection with the Union Medical 
College, if suitable arrangements can be made. 
“Second, that on account of the population, 
wealth and convenience of location of the city of 
Shanghai, the second medical work of the Founda- 
tion be established in that city.” 
In accordance with these recommendations, 
the China Medical Board has devoted much of 
its attention to developing medical education 
in Peking and Shanghai. In addition, it has 
cooperated with many missionary societies by 
assisting them in their work in other parts of 
China, with the result that the Board has made 
contributions to hospitals in ten out of the 
eighteen provinces. Thus far, little has been 
done in southern and western China. 
During the year 1915 there were various 
negotiations ending in the transfer of the Union 
Medical College from the control of the six 
missionary societies which had previously been 
responsible for it to a board of thirteen trustees 
incorporated under the laws of the State of 
New York as the “Peking Union Medical Col-
-P-A-G-E-20
  20 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
lege.” Of this board of trustees seven members 
are appointed by the China Medical Board, and 
one each by the following missionary societies: 
London Missionary Society, Society for the 
Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts, 
The Medical Missionary Association of London, 
Board of Foreign Missions of the Methodist 
Episcopal Church, Board of Foreign Missions 
of the Presbyterian Church in the United States 
of America, and American Board of Commis- 
sioners for Foreign Missions. 
The situation in Shanghai was somewhat dif- 
ferent from that in Peking. For the past five 
years the Harvard Medical School of China had 
been at work there, codperating, since 1913, 
with the hospital of the Red Cross Society of 
China. In addition, there was the medical de- 
partment of the St. John’s University, con- 
ducted in codperation with the Christian Asso- 
ciation of the University of Pennsylvania; and 
at Nanking, only six hours away, the Univer- 
sity of Nanking supported a medical school of 
its own. Plainly this situation was not in har- 
mony with an ideal combination of medical 
resources which should serve the entire lower 
Yangtze valley. 
At its meeting on January 28, however, the 
Board considered a letter from Dr. Robert C. 
Beebe, Secretary of the China Medical Mis- 
sionary Association, transmitting the following 
resolution passed unanimously at a meeting of
-P-A-G-E-21
  MEDICAL WORK IN CHINA 21 
representatives of St. John’s University, Uni- 
versity of Pennsylvania Medical School, Uni- 
versity of Nanking and the Harvard Medical 
School of China: 
“Inasmuch as the China Medical Board of the 
Rockefeller Foundation has in view the establish- 
ment of a medical school in Shanghai which shall 
work in cordial and sympathetic codperation with 
missionary societies, and in which it is desired to 
merge existing medical schools, the representatives 
of St. John’s University and Pennsylvania Medical 
School of the University of Nanking, and of the 
Harvard Medical School of China, in a joint meet- 
ing, held in Shanghai, Thursday, November 4, 1915, 
extend a cordial invitation to the China Medical 
Board to establish in Shanghai a Medical School 
which shall be conducted by a board of trustees 
upon which would be represented the governing 
bodies of the codperating schools.” 
Acting upon this invitation, the China Medi- 
cal Board is developing plans for the establish- 
ment of a new medical school in Shanghai in 
which the goodwill of all the codperating agen- 
cies will be joined. 
In order that the Foundation might be guided 
by the best advice in regard to the technical 
questions of policy and personnel involved in 
the carrying out of its general program, a new 
Commission was sent to China in the summer 
of 1915. Its membership consisted of Dr. Wal- 
lace Buttrick, Secretary of the General Educa- 
tion Board and Director of the China Medical 
Board; Dr. William H. Welch, Professor of 
Pathology in Johns Hopkins University, and
-P-A-G-E-22
    
22 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
Dr. Simon Flexner, Director of the Laboratories 
of the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Re- 
search. During the five months of their ab- 
sence from this country, the members of the 
Commission visited medical schools and hos- 
pitals in Tokyo and Kyoto, Japan; Seoul, Korea, 
and the following places in China: Mukden, 
Peking, Tientsin, Tsinanfu, Hankow, Wuchang, 
Changsha, Nanking, Shanghai, Soochow, Hang- 
chow, Hongkong and Canton. While the con- 
clusions of this Commission were in harmony 
with the general plan of work tentatively adopted . 
upon the recommendations of the Commission 
of 1914, much valuable light was obtained on 
the more concrete aspects of the work to be 
done, and a more adequate estimate of the 
magnitude and the difficulties of the task was 
made possible. In general, the policy of the 
China Medical Board may be said to be that 
of making possible, at the earliest possible date, 
the assumption by the Chinese themselves of 
the task of carrying the advantages of modern 
medicine, both therapeutic and preventive, to 
the masses of China. In other words, the 
highest and best function for the Board, as for 
all foreign agencies for the material and spirit- 
ual betterment of China, is that of training 
leaders, so that the ultimate task shall fall on 
the Chinese themselves. Not only is it impos- 
sible to conceive that an undertaking of such 
colossal proportions could be accomplished with-
-P-A-G-E-23
MEDICAL WORK IN CHINA 23 
out the development and mobilization of the 
resources of China to that end, but it is also 
essential to the success and the permanence of 
any such work that it shall be done by the 
people themselves, for themselves, rather than 
by any outside agency, however large its re- 
sources or beneficent its aims. 
It is a corollary of the proposition that China 
must work out its own salvation under its own 
leaders, that the training of those leaders should 
be the best that the world affords. ‘The work 
to be done through the two great schools in 
Peking and Shanghai will challenge men of the 
highest character and scientific attainments, 
thoroughly imbued with a missionary spirit; 
and the best will be none too good. At a time 
when the medical schools of this country are 
having difficulty in finding adequately trained 
men for professorships in the various depart- 
ments of medicine, the discovery and enlist- 
ment of capable men for service in China is by 
no means a simple matter. There is reason to 
believe, however, that the growing demand for 
well-trained men as teachers of medicine both 
at home and abroad is attracting a larger num- 
ber of men to medical teaching as a profession, 
and it may well prove that the responsibilities 
which this country has assumed in China will 
have a stimulating effect at home, to the great 
advantage of medical education generally.

4 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
INVESTIGATION OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS 
The investigation of industrial relations has 
been continued during the past year by Mr. 
W. L. Mackenzie King. Mr. King had been 
engaged for some time upon bibliographical 
work in an attempt to chart the field of indus- 
trial relations in a manner that would give more 
intelligent direction to such intensive studies as 
he might later pursue. Early in the year, how- 
ever, he decided to utilize the industrial dis- 
turbance in Colorado as a means of coming in 
close contact with the complicated factors of 
industrial unrest. 
Shortly after his arrival, an application was 
made to the Rockefeller Foundation, with the 
approval of the Governor, for aid in relieving 
the great distress that existed in the mining 
regions of Colorado as a result of unemploy- 
ment growing out of the recent industrial dis- 
turbance. The Foundation took advantage of 
Mr. King’s presence in Colorado to secure his 
codperation and advice in dealing with this 
matter. An appropriation of $100,000 was made 
to be expended under the direction of the State 
Committee on Unemployment and Relief, and 
a plan was devised by the Committee in col- 
laboration with Mr. King, whereby a large 
amount of labor was utilized in building roads 
and other public works, payment being made 
in the form of orders on local dealers for the 
ordinary necessities of life. ‘The entire sum ap-
-P-A-G-E-25
  INVESTIGATION OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS 25 
propriated was thus expended to advantage and 
went far to relieve a condition of great suffering 
and hardship. 
Responding to an invitation from the Colo- 
rado Fuel and Iron Company, Mr. King then 
gave the benefit of his knowledge and experience 
to the officers and employees of the company 
in perfecting a plan of industrial representation, 
whereby employees were to be represented, along 
with company officials, on joint committees and 
at district conferences and other meetings. Pro- 
vision was made by the plan for quick and easy 
access on the part of the employees, through 
their representatives or in person, to officers of 
the company with respect to grievances; ar- 
rangements were set up for the prevention and 
settlement of industrial disputes by voluntary 
conciliation and arbitration; social and indus- 
trial betterment policies were adopted and 
definite terms and conditions of employment 
were secured. 
While not claiming for this plan any finality 
as an adjustment of the relations of capital and 
labor, it is not too much to say that it has less- 
ened many of the occasions for misunderstand- 
ing, has proved a means of adjusting grievances 
and has created a degree of good will, which 
warrants the hope of further progress. 
Mr. King resumed his studies at Ottawa after 
the adoption of the plan of industrial represen- 
tation in Colorado, and hopes within a few 
 
-P-A-G-E-26
  
26 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
months to have an outline of industrial relations 
in such a form as to provide an effective basis 
of preliminary consultation with authorities in 
the various aspects of the labor problem. 
MENTAL HYGIENE 
As fields for practical work in mental hygiene 
become more clearly defined it is apparent that 
in this important department of public health 
opportunities for new and extremely useful kinds 
of humanitarian service can be found. At the 
same time participation in such work will pro- 
vide a means through which many social and 
economic problems depending wholly or in 
part upon mental factors can be better under- 
stood and more effectively dealt with. In the 
report of the Foundation for 1913-14 it was 
stated that the most promising avenue for pro- 
moting mental hygiene seemed to be offered by 
the National Committee for Mental Hygiene, 
an organization which had already done fruitful 
work in this field. Accordingly, the services of 
Dr. Thomas W. Salmon, who was appointed a 
member of the staff of the Foundation, were 
placed at the disposal of the National Com- 
mittee for two years. That organization had 
prepared the way for actual surveys of the pro- 
visions existing for the public care and treat- 
ment of the insane and feeble-minded in the 
different States, by a careful study of methods 
of administration and supervision and of the
-P-A-G-E-27
  MENTAL HYGIENE 27 
legal provisions which govern the treatment of 
mental diseases and mental defects. The prac- 
ticability of conducting such surveys and the 
effects upon standards of care and treatment 
which might be expected to result from them 
had already been demonstrated by studies 
undertaken by the National Committee in Wis- 
consin and South Carolina and by affiliated 
State societies in Connecticut and Pennsyl- 
vania. In the hope that the extension of such 
surveys to a number of States would go far 
toward permitting the insane to share more 
equitably in the great advances which have 
characterized the treatment of all classes of the 
sick during recent years, an appropriation was 
made which will enable the National Committee 
to complete surveys in at least sixteen States 
before the close of 1916. Already surveys have 
been completed or are under way in Arkansas, 
Louisiana, Tennessee and Texas and plans are 
being made to inaugurate others early in 1916 
in California, Illinois, Missouri, Indiana, North 
Carolina, North Dakota, Rhode Island and the 
District of Columbia. Invitations have been 
received from other States and arrangements 
will be made as rapidly as possible to begin 
additional surveys. Such invitations come from 
governors, State boards of control or super- 
vision, universities, State societies for mental 
hygiene and other organizations interested es- 
pecially in the welfare of the insane and the  
-P-A-G-E-28
  28 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
mentally defective or in the general advance- 
ment of medicine or philanthropy. At the out- 
set some doubt was felt whether the examina- 
tion by an entirely unofficial agency of such an 
admittedly governmental function as the care 
of the insane would always be welcome. It has 
been particularly gratifying, therefore, to see how 
quickly the advantages to be gained from a 
critical but constructive study of this problem 
by impartial and expert psychiatrists have been 
recognized and how eagerly such surveys are 
being sought. The obligation of entrusting this 
work only to the best qualified men obtainable 
has been fully recognized by the National Com- 
mittee and all the resources of that organiza- 
tion—in information, advice and expert guid- 
ance—will be placed at their disposal. ‘These 
surveys will, in every instance, take into con- 
sideration not only the institutional phases of 
the treatment of mental diseases and mental 
deficiency but the community phases upon 
which, as it is coming to be seen, depend in a 
marked degree our hopes of dealing with the 
really staggering problem of mental diseases 
more successfully in the future than we have 
done in the past. The studies already under- 
taken have brought to light nothing so pathetic 
as the survival of almshouse care of the insane 
in this age of enlightenment. It is becoming 
evident that this most painful phase of Ameri- 
can community life is making its last stand be- 
 
-P-A-G-E-29

PROMOTION OF GOVERNMENTAL RESEARCH 29 
hind popular ignorance of its existence, or of 
its actual characteristics; and it does not seem 
too sanguine to hope that the entire elimination 
of almshouse care of the insane will be one of 
the happy results of these surveys when they 
have been made in all the States. 
Although work in behalf of the insane was 
the first task in mental hygiene to be under- 
taken by the Rockefeller Foundation, oppor- 
tunities for -aiding in the important general 
movement to deal more effectively with mental 
deficiency have received careful study during 
the year. Numerous opportunities to aid in 
this movement have been presented, but it has 
been felt that more favorable points of attack 
exist than most of those which are being brought 
to the attention of the Foundation. To deter- 
mine some methods of approach which will give 
access to fundamental factors seems to be the 
most useful service which can be rendered at 
the present time. 
PROMOTION OF GOVERNMENTAL RESEARCH 
As has been remarked above, the aggregate 
amount of money which the community is spend- 
ing for the welfare of its members through 
public and private agencies is so prodigious 
that the resources of any single individual or 
agency are relatively insignificant. If, how- 
ever, comparatively small funds are used to 
promote the discovery or application of sound  
-P-A-G-E-30
30 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
principles, ideas, or methods in such manner as 
to affect favorably the use made of the general 
resources, the return upon the investment in 
terms of human welfare may become very great. 
In no field of activity has this truth become 
more apparent than in that of governmental 
efficiency. Governmental expenditure lacks the 
checks and safeguards which the ordinary con- 
duct of business affords through competition and 
the necessity of making a profit. While many 
of the functions of government are not sus- 
ceptible of test and measurement by mercantile 
standards, there is a wide field of governmental 
business management within which the ordinary 
tests of economy and efficiency may be applied. 
The construction and maintenance of public 
works, methods of administration and account- 
ing, and many of the processes of purchase 
and sale are reducible to a strictly business 
basis and should be so reduced in the public 
interest no less than in that of the taxpayer as 
such. 
The New York Bureau of Municipal Research 
has been the recognized pioneer in this field of 
public service, and the fruits of its work are 
discernible not only in the improvement of the 
business administration of the City of New York 
but also in the creation of similar bureaus of re- 
search in many different cities as well as the 
Institute for Government Research recently in- 
corporated in the District of Columbia. 
 
-P-A-G-E-31
  PROMOTION OF GOVERNMENTAL RESEARCH 31 
The progress of the municipal research move- 
ment in the United States has been marked by 
two distinct kinds of service. The first, on 
which the most emphasis has hitherto been 
laid, has been that of codperating with govern- 
ment officials in the setting up of better methods 
of accounting and business administration. The 
spirit and method of this work should be as far 
removed as possible from what is commonly 
known as “muckraking.” While it may happen 
that the study of actual conditions will reveal 
gross inefficiency or even corruption, the dom- 
inant motive is not, or should not be, that of 
making personal attacks or sensational revela- 
tions, but rather that of effecting improvement. 
The second kind of service is that of making 
scientific studies of the processes of govern- 
mental administration with a view to discover- 
ing or inventing the best methods and of 
standardizing them in such a way as to make 
them available for general use. The Founda- 
tion has made substantial appropriations during 
the past year for both kinds of service. It has 
contributed to the funds of the New York 
Bureau of Municipal Research for carrying on 
the regular work in the government of New 
York City and for studies in the government 
of the State of New York. In addition to these 
contributions, the Foundation has appropriated 
$50,000 for the promotion of certain funda- 
mental scientific studies, the results of which  
-P-A-G-E-32
  32 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
are expected to benefit governmental adminis- 
tration generally, whether national, state or 
local. Among these studies the following are 
the most important: 
(1) Methods of Budget Making and Financial 
Administration: (2) Standards and Practices 
Evolved for the Improvement of the Civil Ser- ~ 
vice ; (3) Provisions for Pensions and Retire- 
ment Allowances; (4) Methods of Public 
Accounting ; (5) Highway Legislation. 
These studies have been conducted by Dr. 
Frederick A. Cleveland, the Director of the 
New York Bureau of Municipal Research, under 
the general supervision of a special committee 
appointed by the Rockefeller Foundation. The 
publication of the results of several of these 
studies is expected during the ensuing year. 
WAR RELIEF 
The Rockefeller Foundation continued during 
the past year to appropriate funds for the relief 
of suffering caused by the war. The appended 
report of the War Relief Commission describes 
in detail the various activities of the Commission 
and the appropriations made upon their recom- 
mendation. It will be noted that the attention 
of the Foundation has been centred chiefly on 
the relief of non-combatants, especially those 
who by race or nationality have been only 
secondarily if at all involved in the main an- 
tagonisms of which the war is the deplorable
-P-A-G-E-33
  WAR RELIEF 33 
expression. While it is true that international 
law attributes the quality of neutrality to the 
succor of those wounded in battle, and that such 
service is both permissible and admirable, it has 
seemed to the Trustees of the Rockefeller 
Foundation that an agency which centered its 
attention on measures of civilian relief sanc- 
tioned by the belligerent nations of both groups, 
would be in a position to perform the most effec- 
tive service for the millions of non-combatants 
whose sufferings have constituted one of the 
most terrible as they have been perhaps the 
least definitely anticipated results of the war. 
The relief of the civilian inhabitants of Bel- 
gium, Poland, Serbia, and the Ottoman Em- 
pire by American agencies has been condi- 
tioned very largely upon their codperation with 
the governments of both the Central Powers 
and the Allies; and all that these American 
agencies have been able to do has met but a 
fraction of the need. 
There is, indeed, one branch of relief work 
aided by the Foundation which is for the benefit 
of combatants, but this too is one which com- 
mands the sympathy of both belligerent groups, 
namely, the work of the International Com- 
mittee of Young Men’s Christian Associations in 
the military and prison camps of the contending 
nations. ‘The task here has been to arrest and 
counteract the demoralizing tendencies of 
enforced idleness in camp which threaten to 
 
-P-A-G-E-34
34 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
prove among the most far-reaching of all the 
malign influences of the war. This important 
work has been well managed, has won the con- 
fidence of the governments concerned and 
promises to make one of the most creditable 
pages in the record of American relief work. 
Early in the past year the Commission for 
Relief in Belgium perfected its organization in 
the United States for the purchase and trans- 
portation of supplies for Belgium, and the 
Foundation appropriately relinquished these 
functions which it had temporarily assumed in 
the emergency existing during the first months of 
the war. In response to a special appeal to the 
American public the Foundation made a con- 
tribution of $200,000 to the Commission for 
Relief in Belgium for the purchase of materials 
to be made into clothing for Belgians, by 
Belgian labor. The Foundation also assisted 
the Commission by providing for a few months 
in Rotterdam an organization for the assorting 
and re-shipping of the vast quantities of clothing 
that had been contributed from various parts 
of the world. For the relief of the large numbers 
of Belgian refugees in Holland the Foundation 
organized sewing classes employing several thou- 
sand women, and provided materials and ma- 
chines adequate for the manufacture of clothing 
then sorely needed by the refugees. This work 
was administered with the cordial codperation 
of the Government of the Netherlands and
-P-A-G-E-35
WAR RELIEF 35 
was later carried on under its direct auspices. 
In England the Foundation continued its contri- 
bution toward the support of professors from 
Belgian universities in order to enable them to 
continue their studies. 
The American Red Cross, with the cooperation 
of the Foundation and that of medical agencies 
sent from Great Britain, France, and Russia, un- 
dertook during the spring and summer of 1915 the 
formidable task of combating an epidemic of ty- 
phus fever in Serbia. Dr. Richard P. Strong, who 
headed the American Red Cross mission, became 
the director of an international board organized 
under the authority of the Serbian government, 
and important administrative, medical, and 
police measures, calculated to discover the 
incidence of the disease and to stop its spread, 
were promptly taken. The subsidence of the 
epidemic was doubtless materially accelerated 
by these measures, and, what promised to be of 
even greater importance, the local authorities 
and the common people were prepared to defend 
themselves more effectively against subsequent 
outbreaks. After the epidemic was at an end 
the Rockefeller Foundation appropriated the 
funds necessary to continue the work of sanita- 
tion for a period of six months, but this work was 
interrupted in October, 1915, by the occupa- 
tion of Serbia by the Central Powers. For- 
tunately Mr. Stuart, the engineer in charge, was 
permitted by the new military authorities to  
-P-A-G-E-36
36 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
direct his energies to relief work, and though 
laboring under great diffculties due to the 
exigencies of the military situation, he was able 
to make good use of the funds placed at his 
disposal by the American Red Cross and the 
Rockefeller Foundation. 
The report of the War Relief Commission 
indicates that great importance has been at- 
tached by the Foundation to the relief of suffer- 
ing in the Ottoman Empire and in the adjacent 
portions of Russia and Persia to which hundreds 
of thousands of Armenian and Syrian refugees 
had fled. In all these areas the need has been of 
a sort that could be met in large measure by the 
local use of funds, first for the purchase of food, 
clothing, and shelter, and later for the provision 
of live stock, seed, and farming implements. 
Fortunately, both in Turkey and in the neigh- 
boring territories, trustworthy American agents 
having the respect of the authorities were on the 
spot and the funds provided have been applied 
in a manner justifying the confidence of con- 
tributors to the American Committee for 
Armenian and Syrian Relief, through which 
most of the Foundation gifts have been made. 
In Poland it has unhappily proved impossible 
for outside relief agencies to organize and direct 
their efforts on a scale commensurate with the 
enormous need. Much has been done by the 
American public through various committees, 
and especially through the American Jewish

Relief Committee, so far as gifts of money could 
be made effective, to. mitigate the terrors of 
famine and exile, but the one outstanding need 
of some neutral agency to import food and 
clothing under suitable guarantees so as to make 
possible the feeding of whole communities 
numbering millions of people, as in Belgium, has 
not yet been met in spite of the prolonged efforts 
that have been made. Meanwhile, hundreds of 
thousands of men, women, and children have 
perished. 
Through the Rockefeller Institute for Medical 
Research the Foundation has continued its sup- 
port of the surgical laboratory maintained in 
connection with a military hospital at Compiégne 
under the direction of Dr. Alexis Carrel. The 
purpose of this laboratory has been to improve 
existing methods of treating wounds, especially 
those which are infected, with a view to saving 
life and limb and accelerating the process of 
healing. Results of undoubted significance have 
already been obtained with the collaboration of 
Dr. Henry D. Dakin who has dealt with the 
important chemical aspects of the problem, and 
these results have been made generally available 
by publication.

the War Relief Commission the Chairman ac-

  I. GENERAL SUMMARY 
The resolutions creating the International 
Health Commission assigned to it two tasks: 
to codperate with the United States and other 
countries in measures for the relief and control 
of uncinariasis, or hookworm disease, as oppor- 
tunity offers; and so far as practicable to follow 
up the treatment and cure of this disease with 
the development of agencies for the promotion of 
public sanitation and the spread of the knowledge 
of scientific medicine. Up to 1915 the Com- 
mission had confined its efforts almost wholly to 
the relief and control of hookworm disease; dur- 
ing the year just ended this work has been 
extended and certain new lines of activity have 
been undertaken. 
In the United States measures against hook- 
worm disease were carried out during the year 
in codperation with the states of Alabama, 
Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, 
North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, 
Texas, and Virginia; in other countries in co- 
Operation with Government in Antigua, British 
Guiana, Dutch Guiana, Grenada, St. Lucia, St. 
Vincent, and Trinidad, in the West Indies; in 
Costa Rica, Guatemala, Nicaragua, and Pan- 
ama, in Central America; and in Egypt and the 
Federated Malay States, in the Orient; arrange- 43
-P-A-G-E-44
  44 INTERNATIONAL HEALTH COMMISSION 
ments have been made for inaugurating the 
work in the Seychelles Islands and in Salvador; 
an infection survey is being made in British 
Honduras to determine whether the work of 
relief and control should be undertaken there; 
and an investigation of the prevalence of the 
infection among the agricultural population of 
Hunan, China, is being carried out under the 
direction of Dr. Hume, of the Yale Medical 
School of Changsha. The Commission is pre- 
pared to aid in extending this work to other 
countries as conditions invite. 
In the Federated Malay States hookworm 
infection is known to be prevalent, but to arrive 
at a just estimate of its importance as a dis- 
abling disease has been made extremely difficult 
by the prevalence of a severe form of malaria 
and the mingling of a number of different nation- 
alities. A scientific commission has been ap- 
pointed and is now on the ground carrying out 
an investigation to determine whether the effects 
of hookworm disease in that country are suffi- 
ciently serious to justify systematic effort for 
its relief and control. 
Preliminary arrangements have been made for 
a survey to determine the feasibility of under- 
taking at this time the eradication of yellow 
fever, and for experiments to test the practi- 
cability of controlling malaria. Attention has 
been given to the collection of information re- 
lating to medical education and to agencies for

the control of disease in many countries. In 
cooperation with Government in the Philip- 
pine Islands a hospital ship is being provided for 
the inhabitants of the Sulu Archipelago. More 
detailed information concerning each of these 
activities is given in succeeding pages. 
I 
MEASURES AGAINST HOOKWORM DISEASE 
During the year the International Health 
Commission has codperated with ten Southern 
states and with thirteen foreign countries in 
work for the relief and control of hookworm 
disease. The director of the work in each of 
these states and countries has prepared a de- 
tailed report, usually at the end of each quarter, 
of the work under his supervision, and by the 
courtesy of the several state and national de- 
partments of health, the Commission has been 
kept in intimate touch with what was being 
done in each field of operation. In summarizing 
and reporting the methods and progress of the 
work in all these countries it is not intended to 
imply that the work is being done by the Com- 
mission. The Commission does not undertake 
on its own account the relief and control of 
hookworm disease in any country. If the work 
is to be successful the state or country in which 
the infection exists must assume the burden of 
responsibility. The Commission has had the
-P-A-G-E-46
  46 INTERNATIONAL HEALTH COMMISSION 
privilege of sharing in the work by making 
small contributions toward its maintenance and 
by lending a few well-trained men to aid in its 
organization, but in some countries even the 
larger share of the financial burden is borne, and 
in all cases most of the men are supplied, by the 
countries themselves. In the Southern States 
the Commission is now contributing about one- 
third of the amount required to maintain the 
work. The most important and most encour- 
aging feature of the undertaking is the initiative 
and responsibility assumed by national, state, 
and local authorities. 
The control of hookworm disease is an under- 
taking of enormous magnitude, and can be ac- 
complished only by permanent agencies working 
over along period of time. ‘The disease is found 
in practically all countries which lie in the 
tropical and sub-tropical zones, extending from 
parallel 36 degrees north to parallel 30 degrees 
south. More than one-half of the population of 
the globe live in this area. The prevalence of 
the infection and the severity of its effects as a 
disabling disease vary greatly from country to 
country and from locality to locality within a 
given country. In some countries the percent- 
age of persons infected is high, while the disease 
is relatively mild in form; in other regions these 
conditions are reversed. In general it may be 
said that where racial immunity does not enter 
as a determining factor, the disease assumes its 
 
-P-A-G-E-47
  GENERAL SUMMARY 47 
most virulent form in those countries in which 
it is also the most wide-spread. Of 1,458,483 
persons taken at random and microscopically 
examined during the period from January 1, 
1910, to December 31, 1915, in countries where 
the work has been in progress, 531,749, or 36.5 
per cent, have been found infected. In these 
countries the infection ranged from a minimum 
of 27.3 per cent to a maximum of 83.6 per cent 
of.the population examined. In Ceylon, where 
the work is just getting under way, microscopic 
examination shows that more than 96 per cent 
of the entire population on certain large rubber 
estates are infected, and, as would be expected 
where the percentage of infection runs so high, 
the results in the form of anemia and impaired 
working efficiency are in many cases extremely 
severe. 
In no country is the death rate ascribed 
directly to hookworm disease particularly high; 
this disease is never spectacular, like yellow 
fever or plague or pernicious malaria. It is 
the greater menace because it works subtly. 
Acute diseases sometimes tend to strengthen 
the race by killing off the weak; but hookworm 
disease, working so insidiously as frequently to 
escape the attention even of its victims, tends 
to weaken the race by sapping its vitality. Per- 
sons harboring this infection are more suscep- 
tible to such diseases as malaria, typhoid fever, 
pneumonia, and tuberculosis, which prey upon 
 
-P-A-G-E-48
  48, INTERNATIONAL HEALTH COMMISSION 
lowered vitality. But even more important 
than this indirect contribution to the death roll 
are the cumulative results,—physical, intellec- 
tual, economic, and moral,—which are handed 
down from generation to generation through 
long periods of time. 
The disease is caused by a small parasitic worm 
(Uncinaria, or hookworm) which attaches itself 
to the inner lining of the intestine and there 
sucks and poisons the blood of its victim. ‘Thou- 
sands of these parasites may live in the intestine 
of a single person; in one case by authentic 
count more than 6,000 hookworms were passed 
by a patient as a result of treatment. The fe- 
males are remarkably prolific egg-producers. 
So long as they remain in the intestine these 
eggs do not hatch, but when passed from the 
bowels and deposited on the ground under proper 
conditions of air, heat, and moisture, they hatch 
within the brief space of from twenty-four to 
forty hours. ‘The young hookworms, which are 
too small to be seen with the naked eye, may live 
on and near the surface of the ground for many 
months. So long as they remain in the soil they 
remain microscopic in size. They enter the 
human host by boring through the skin of the 
bare feet or hands or other portions of the body 
which are brought into contact with soil in which 
they exist, and pass into the circulating blood. 
Finally they reach the small intestine, where 
they attain the adult stage, proceed to prey
-P-A-G-E-49
  GENERAL SUMMARY 49 
upon their host, and begin anew the life-cycle 
here outlined. 
Measures for the control of hookworm dis- 
ease spring directly from the life-history of 
the parasite, and theoretically are definite and 
simple. The disease may be controlled by put- 
ting a stop to soil contamination. The para- 
site does not multiply in the body of its human 
host; every hookworm in the intestine entered 
the body from the outside and came from pol- 
luted soil, where this infective form hatches and 
thrives. With proper disposal of human ex- 
crement to prevent contamination of the soil the 
hookworm would become extinct. In practical 
operation, however, this resolves itself into a 
sanitary problem of the first magnitude. Regu- 
lations designed to prevent soil pollution can- 
not be made effective by sheer compulsion; they 
must remain in large measure ineffective until 
the people have been shown the dangers in- 
volved and have been brought to the point of 
helpful codperation. 
Theoretically, the disease may be brought 
under control by curing the infected persons. 
Every embryo in the soil was hatched from an 
egg which came from the intestine of an infected 
person. If all carriers were cured and kept 
cured for a year the soil within this time would 
become sterile and the parasite would be extinct. 
In practice it is extremely difficult when dealing 
with large populations to carry this measure to
-P-A-G-E-50

completeness. Experience has demonstrated, 
however, that by treatment of infected persons 
a large measure of control may be achieved. 
In the work to which the Commission gives 
aid these two measures are combined. The ex- 
amination and treatment of infected persons is 
well worth while even if considered merely as a 
means of relieving suffering and inefficiency. 
As a control measure it is indispensable, in that 
it affords the most effective means of educating 
the people and thus making it possible to carry 
into effect the sanitary measures upon which 
Government must depend for the final control of 
the disease. 
Working Arrangement with Governments 
In most of the countries where the Com- 
mission shares in work for the relief and control 
of hookworm disease, the plan of operations 
provides for two staffs: the one toward the main- 
tenance of which the Commission contributes 
devotes itself to the work of examining, treat- 
ing, and educating the people; the other, which 
is maintained by Government, devotes itself to 
bringing into operation and maintaining the 
necessary sanitary measures to prevent re-in- 
fection. ‘This has proved highly satisfactory as 
a working arrangement. The two staffs work 
in complete harmony under the general super- 
vision of the department of health as two parts 
of one working machine, but there is a distinct
-P-A-G-E-51
  GENERAL SUMMARY 51 
advantage in their operating and being recog- 
nized by the people as separate organizations. 
The one is essentially a temporary organization, 
the other is permanent. By being recognized as 
separate, the former finds it possible to secure the 
utmost good-will of the people, upon whose co- 
Operation its work of examining, treating, and 
teaching depends, and to have this codperation 
without the prejudice sometimes arising from 
the work of the sanitary officers, who must oc- 
casionally cause resentment by their efforts to 
compel the people to improve the sanitary con- 
ditions of their premises. The temporary organ- 
ization, because of its having the undisturbed 
confidence and good-will of the people, finds it 
possible while examining and treating them to 
educate them to a definite understanding of the 
sanitary needs, and thereby to make it possible 
for the sanitary organization to carry out its 
work with a minimum of compulsion. This 
working arrangement has the additional advan- 
tage of providing opportunity for Government 
to build up its permanent sanitary organization 
gradually, as the work advances from area to 
area and as a sustaining public sentiment is de- 
veloped. The results thus far in the direction 
of developing sanitary organizations, trained to 
do at least one bit of definite work, have more 
than justified expectations.

Working Methods 
Working methods are varied somewhat to 
suit local conditions, but in all countries the 
end being sought is the same; and in all countries 
the people are being examined, treated, and 
taught, and effort is being made to bring into 
operation such permanent system of sanitation 
as will in the end bring the disease under com- 
plete control. In the progress of the work there 
have developed two distinct methods of attack 
by which the control measures are applied. 
The one is known as the dispensary plan, and 
the other, which has come as a later develop- 
ment, as the intensive plan. In the one case 
the work of examining, treating, and educating 
the people centers around the free traveling 
dispensary, and has the advantage of covering 
large areas and of reaching large numbers of 
people in a comparatively short time; in the 
other, the whole work, including sanitation, is 
limited for a given time to a small area, and has 
the advantage of greater thoroughness in every 
detail. 
Work by the Dispensary Plan 
The dispensary plan of attack for the relief 
and control of hookworm disease was first em- 
ployed on a large scale in Porto Rico by the 
Porto Rico Anemia Commission; and there it 
demonstrated its usefulness in bringing prompt 
relief to something more than 300,000 sufferers 
and in giving to the people of that island and of
-P-A-G-E-53
  GENERAL SUMMARY 53 
other countries a demonstration so convincing 
that its influence is still effective in the work 
now in progress around the globe. Where this 
plan is followed, dispensaries visit at regular 
intervals the towns and villages most conve- 
nient to the people and offer free examination 
and free treatment to all who apply. The es- 
sentials of a dispensary staff are a physician 
who has been definitely trained in all details 
of the work, and a corps of assistants—usually 
lay assistants—who have been trained to pro- 
ficiency as microscopists in examining fecal 
specimens for intestinal parasites. The staff is 
equipped with microscopes, specimen containers, 
hemoglobinometers, the necessary drugs, record 
forms, camera, lantern and slides, charts, leaf- 
lets, and a fund of exhibit material for effective 
educational work. The dispensary as a work- 
ing agency does not undertake to examine the 
whole population, but only those who apply; 
it dispenses the necessary drugs to those who 
desire treatment, but does not administer treat- 
ment under direct supervision; it cannot follow 
up its first treatments with continued re-exam- 
ination and re-treatment until cure has been 
demonstrated; and it does not remain in one 
place long enough to effect conspicuous results 
in sanitation which it may measure and record 
as definitely accomplished. 
But experience has shown that the dispensary 
is a most effective means of bringing speedy re-
-P-A-G-E-54
  54 INTERNATIONAL HEALTH COMMISSION 
lief to a large number of people distributed over 
wide areas, and that it is equally effective as an 
agency for educating the people en masse and 
creating a sustaining public sentiment which 
makes possible the more intensive type of work 
which may follow. By the dispensary plan of 
work, within little more than three years prac- 
tically the whole infected area of eleven Southern 
states was covered; the press, the schools, the 
practicing physicians were enlisted; treatment 
was given by the dispensaries and practicing 
physicians to about 750,000 persons; and 20,- 
000,000 people were educated as to the impor- 
tance of the disease and the methods of its relief 
and control. 
Some work of this type has been done during 
1915 in the states of Alabama, Georgia, Ken- 
tucky, Tennessee, and Texas in the United States; 
in Grenada, St. Lucia, and Trinidad in the West 
Indies; and in Costa Rica, Guatemala, Nicara- 
gua, and Panama in Central America. The 
official working forces operating under this plan 
have microscopically examined during the period 
from January 1, 1910, to December 31, 1915, 
1,390,040 persons; have found 501,094, or 36 
per cent of these, to be infected; and have given 
treatment to 565,080 persons.’ (For results in 
detail see Tables III and IV, pages 82 and 83.) 
1Some persons were treated on clinical diagnosis.

GENERAL SUMMARY 55 
Work by the Intensive Plan 
The fight against hookworm disease in the 
mines of Hungary and of Switzerland tends to 
show that its complete control within a given 
area is a possible achievement. Under the in- 
tensive plan of work, as it is being carried out in 
the United States and in other countries, effort is 
made to approximate, as nearly as practicable, 
complete control of the disease within the area of 
operations. The plan was first tried out in part 
on Knott’s Island in eastern North Carolina, and 
later was put to the test in more thorough detail 
in the Peter’s Hall district, British Guiana. 
The success of this experiment, as carried out in 
British Guiana and in some of the states, dem- 
onstrated the feasibility of the undertaking and 
established the intensive plan of work as the 
prevailing type. Work of this type has been in 
progress during the year in the states of Ken- 
tucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, 
South Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia; in the 
Colonies of Antigua, British Guiana, Dutch 
Guiana, St. Lucia, St. Vincent, and Trinidad; 
and in most of the other countries, where the 
dispensary plan has been followed, the work has 
been growing more and more intensive in 
character. 
Experience during the year has demonstrated 
that the intensive plan of work is feasible under 
a great variety of conditions, and strongly sug- 
gests its applicability under all conditions, irre- 
   
-P-A-G-E-56
  56 INTERNATIONAL HEALTH COMMISSION 
spective of race, creed, occupation, environment, 
distribution of population, or degree of infection. 
Successful work has been done in areas where as 
many as five different languages are spoken, and 
where East Indians, Negroes, Chinese, Portu- 
guese, and creoles of English, French, and Spanish 
blood, with a great variety of mixed breeds, make 
up the population. The distribution of popu- 
lation has varied from the densely inhabited 
villages of British Guiana and Trinidad to the 
scattered and almost inaccessible rural homes of 
St. Vincent, where in one instance, with a donkey 
to ride, only two homes could be visited in a day. 
One medical officer in charge states it as his con- 
viction that the intensive plan can be made to 
work in any territory where people and hook- 
worm infection are to be found. The determin- 
ing factor would seem to be whether the need of 
control justifies the cost. But even in St. Vin- 
cent, with its sparse population and difficulties 
of travel, the per capita cost has not been pro- 
hibitive. 
The territorial unit of operations under this 
plan may be a county, or it may be a small, well- 
defined community containing from 1,000 to 
15,000 people. For purposes of convenience and 
efficiency in practical administration, the larger 
unit area is divided into a number of small dis- 
tricts, and to each of these districts is assigned 
one field worker who is held responsible for re- 
sults within this area. The work to be carried
-P-A-G-E-57
GENERAL SUMMARY 57 
out involves: mapping the district, locating 
roads, streams, and houses; taking a census of 
the population, numbering the houses in which 
the people live, recording name, age, sex, race, 
and post-office address; making microscopic ex- 
amination of the entire population; adminis- 
tering treatment to all persons found to be 
infected; and continuing treatment and micro- 
scopic examination of each patient until cure 
is effected. While this work is in progress the 
people are taught, by illustrated lectures, by 
leaflets and charts, and by personal, concrete 
instruction in a house-to-house visit, the essen- 
tials of hookworm disease and its control. 
The plan of work as conducted in those coun- 
tries in which the local government is under- 
taking on an adequate basis to prevent re- 
infection, has the advantage of being definite and 
thorough and of giving one a sense of accom- 
plishment closely approximating completeness. 
The director of the work does not have to guess 
at the prevalence of infection in a given com- 
munity. He sends a nurse with specimen con- 
tainers to every home, gets a specimen from 
each individual, has these specimens examined 
under the microscope by a competent staff, and 
by this examination locates the carriers of in- 
fection. The treatment of the infected is 
equally definite. The medical officer has in 
thymol a specific for the parasite. He sends a 
nurse to the home of each infected person to
-P-A-G-E-58
58 INTERNATIONAL HEALTH COMMISSION 
administer the treatment, and follows the suc- 
cessive treatments with microscopic re-examina- 
tions until a cure has been demonstrated. The 
sanitary work is as thorough as that of examina- 
tion and treatment. The sanitary problem of 
the community is determined by a house-to- 
house survey of latrine conditions, and the 
object in sanitation has been accomplished when 
every house has been provided with adequate 
latrine accommodations and when a system of 
inspection has been established to guarantee 
their proper use. 
The sanitary work, which must be kept under 
a system of permanent inspection, is carried out 
by permanent government agencies. Where no 
sanitary organization exists the intensive work 
enables Government to undertake a definite 
sanitary task on the basis of an insignificant 
outlay and to develop its sanitary organization 
gradually, as the work is extended from com- 
munity to community and as the people are 
educated to the point of giving willing and in- 
telligent codperation. The thoroughness and 
permanency of the sanitary work give one a 
sense of results that is lasting. 
In most communities, as the reports show, 
the staff does not succeed in examining the total 
population, nor does it succeed in curing all of 
those who are infected. This was done on 
Knott’s Island and it could be done in other 
communities. But there is a point beyond
-P-A-G-E-59
GENERAL SUMMARY 59 
which it is not feasible to carry the work of ex- 
amination and treatment. In Trinidad, 91.5 
per cent of the total population of the areas in 
which intensive work was conducted were ex- 
amined, and 90.8 per cent of the infected were 
put under treatment; of these, 14.6 per cent 
removed from the area before treatment was 
completed, and 74.7 per cent were known to be 
cured. In British Guiana, 94.4 per cent of the 
population within the areas of operation were 
examined; of these, 62.3 per cent were infected; 
90.6 per cent of the infected were treated; and 
84.3 per cent of those under treatment were 
cured. In St. Vincent, 99.9 per cent of the 
people within the areas were examined; 94.9 
per cent of the infected were treated; and 84.9 
per cent were cured. It may be reasonably ex- 
pected that the slight amount of infection left 
in the community will be eliminated by means 
of sanitation. (See Table VI, page 86.) 
The economic value of systematic work for 
the relief and control of hookworm disease is 
indicated in a report issued by the Immigration 
Department of Trinidad, in which it is stated 
that where the indentured laborers on estates 
have been treated for the disease, their efficiency, 
measured in hours of labor performed, has in- 
creased from 20 to 30 per cent. The Depart- 
ment also reports that on one estate, sanitary 
reform and treatment of persons have reduced 
by two-thirds the number of patients admitted
-P-A-G-E-60

60 INTERNATIONAL HEALTH COMMISSION 
to the estate hospital. Similar results are exhib- 
ited at the Orphanage and Industrial School at 
Tunapuna, where the number of admissions to 
the hospital dropped to one-third immediately 
following the elimination of hookworm infection, 
and where during the last two months of the year 
only three patients were admitted to the hospital, 
as against a monthly average of forty admissions 
for the previous four years. 
The Latrine Problem 
Soil pollution is largely responsible for the 
spread of typhoid fever, diarrhoea, dysentery, 
intestinal parasites, and similar diseases. It is 
entirely responsible for the transmission of hook- 
worm infection and is therefore directly con- 
nected with the work. 
Soil pollution seldom occurs in cities and towns 
where there are modern water-closets available 
for the entire population. Many rural com- 
munities do not have latrines, which means that 
human excrement is deposited on the ground, 
and through flies, insects, or direct contact, in- 
fected material finds its way into the bodies of 
other human beings. This is responsible for 
thousands upon thousands of cases of illness and 
death each year. Curing persons of hookworm 
infection is of little value unless steps are taken 
to prevent their re-infection. The extent and 
seriousness of the problem may be seen from the 
following figures. A sanitary survey was made  
-P-A-G-E-61
GENERAL SUMMARY 61 
in 770 counties in eleven states with a view to 
ascertaining the conditions at the homes which 
are responsible for the prevalence of hookworm 
infection. In this survey 287,606 farm houses 
were examined, and of these 142,230 were found 
to have no latrine of any kind. This means that 
at nearly half of the homes soil pollution invari- 
ably prevailed. At a very large number of the 
homes reported as having latrines, they were of 
the open-back type which does not prevent soil 
pollution. At only six-tenths of one per cent 
of the homes were the provisions for the pre- 
vention of soil contamination reported by the 
state authorities as satisfactory. 
In the intensive community work which is now 
being carried out in the United States and in 
other countries, chief emphasis is being given to 
improvement in sanitation. The people are 
being taught the dangers of soil pollution and 
are being urged to install some type of latrine as 
a preventive measure. The lesson is driven 
home by insistent repetition in a house-to-house 
canvass; and local carpenters are employed to 
assist in construction. As a result of this effort 
latrines are being installed in large numbers. 
(See Tables IX and X, pages 91 and 92.) In 
many communities such provision has been made 
at every home while the work was in progress; 
and in other communities where this feature of 
the work is left uncompleted, it is continued by 
local effort as a result of the momentum which 
 
-P-A-G-E-62
  62 INTERNATIONAL HEALTH COMMISSION 
has been given it. It seems not unreasonable to 
expect that the systematic effort which these 
states and.countries are now making to control 
hookworm disease and other enteric diseases 
will continue until sanitary conditions at rural 
homes are satisfactory. 
But from the success of the present effort in 
inducing the people to provide and to use some 
form of sanitary arrangement to prevent con- 
tamination of the soil arises a new problem 
which cannot be ignored; namely, the problem 
of the relative efficiency or inefficiency of the 
various types of latrines that are being installed. 
In view of the fact that practical measures are 
being adopted and that state and national de- 
partments of health are committing themselves 
to policies to be carried out on a large scale, the 
so-called “latrine problem’’ becomes a matter of 
serious concern. The International Health Com- 
mission is not prepared to advise as to the type 
of latrine to be installed. The local department 
of health in each state and country is respon- 
sible to the people for all sanitary measures 
carried out under its direction, and must there- 
fore use its own judgment as to the type of 
latrine which it recommends. In the com- 
munity work which is now under way in the 
United States there is considerable diversity of 
views and of policies. The Kentucky State 
Board of Health, for example, is committed to 
the so-called Kentucky type of privy (a con-
-P-A-G-E-63
GENERAL SUMMARY 63 
crete septic tank), and this alone is being in- 
stalled in the community work in that state. 
In Louisiana both the L. R. S. type (barrel 
privy designed by Lumsden, Roberts, and 
Stiles) and the Kentucky type are being in- 
stalled. In other states, as in Virginia and 
Mississippi, the state departments of health 
recommend a variety of types, including the 
Kentucky, the box, the barrel, the pail, and the 
pit, the type adopted being determined by the 
conditions which prevail in the communities 
where the work is done. In these states the pit 
latrine is the one most frequently installed. 
Each of these latrines has its advantages 
and disadvantages; but in the light of present 
knowledge one is not prepared to say of any of 
them that it meets all the requirements of the 
situation. The Kentucky privy and the barrel 
privy under properly controlled conditions em- 
body the principles of the septic tank. Their 
cost is a hindrance to their general use in rural 
communities under present conditions in these 
states. Careful study of those that are in 
operation should be made to ascertain whether 
the effluent is safe under the conditions of family 
and community use. The pail under controlled 
conditions, with incineration of its contents, is 
safe; but in practical experience in rural com- 
munities it is found that it frequently becomes 
offensive and falls into disuse; that it is ex- 
tremely difficult to keep the boxes fly-proof and  
-P-A-G-E-64
  64 “~ INTERNATIONAL HEALTH COMMISSION 
to have the pails properly cared for. When 
the pails are emptied the content is buried in 
the soil, thus involving a series of conditions. 
and possible consequences which call for care- 
ful investigation in the field under the condi- 
tions of actual experience. ‘The pit privy which 
is being installed in large numbers in some of 
the states has the advantage of being inexpen- 
sive, simple in construction, and almost auto- 
matic in operation. It is coming into use on a 
large scale mainly for the reason that it is found 
to be feasible, that the people can be induced to 
install it, and to use it. So far as hookworm 
infection is concerned, it seems to be reasonably 
efficient. But it involves a large accumulation 
of excreta under ground, with whatever this 
condition implies as to dangers of water con- 
tamination by seepage and underground drain- 
age. 
Here, then, is the problem: to find a satisfac- 
tory method for the disposal of sewage at the 
farm home; one which the people in rural com- 
munities may be brought to adopt and to carry 
out, and one which will prove to be safe in actual 
experience under the conditions which prevail in 
these communities. ‘The intensive community 
work now under way is being impelled and 
guided by the conviction that out of the grow- 
ing volume and variety of experience which is 
being gained, there will emerge by gradual evo- 
lution a form of adjustment that will be satis-

factory. But in order to hasten this develop- 
ment and to avoid serious error in the meantime, 
this whole experience should be subjected to 
critical examination. In what has already been 
done there is sufficient volume and variety of 
experience to afford a satisfactory basis for a 
critical study of the advantages and disadvan- 
tages or relative efficiency of the various methods 
employed for the disposal of sewage at the rural 
home. The state departments of health are 
eager to have this study made, and offer co- 
operation in carrying it out; the Commission is 
prepared to codperate by supplying the neces- 
sary funds for the work; working plans are being 
matured; the results of the many scientific 
studies that have been made of different phases 
of the problem are being summarized, and it is 
hoped that the investigation may be under way 
within the coming year. The work, if under- 
taken, will need to extend over a long period of 
time and to cover a considerable area of field 
work in order to test experience under all sea- 
sons and under a sufficient variety of conditions. 
The aim will be to subject present procedures to 
scientific examination with a view to pointing 
the way, if possible, to a method for the disposal 
of sewage at the country home that will be safe 
and that will be workable under prevailing 
conditions,

Hookworm Disease Exhibit at San Francisco 
Early in the year 1915, the International 
Health Commission installed an exhibit on 
uncinariasis in the Palace of Education at the 
Panama-Pacific International Exposition, which 
was held at San Francisco from February 20 
to December 4, 1915. The most valuable and 
most impressive feature of the exhibit was a 
series of glass and wax models prepared by ex- 
perts of first-rate ability. A series of eleven 
models in glass exhibited on a scale highly mag- 
nified the anatomical structure and life-history 
of the parasite. The artist had spent months 
in study with the microscope and succeeded in 
reproducing microscopic detail by means of col- 
ored glass on a scale which the layman could 
see and understand. 
A series of twelve models in wax and in plaster 
and wax exhibited in most lifelike and impressive 
form the effects of uncinariasis on its victim. 
‘The artist and his staff of artisans went to the 
Southern States, where they worked in the heart 
of an infected region amid surroundings which 
made it possible to reproduce details true to life. 
Afflicted boys were brought in and casts—in 
many cases complete body casts—were made 
from these subjects. 
A series of largé transparencies; a series of 
framed photographic enlargements; and about 
100 photographs conveniently mounted on rotat- 
ing wings, showing individuals and families

afflicted with the disease, dispensaries in opera- 
tion for the treatment of the people, and the 
physical improvement of individuals and of fam- 
ilies after cure, served to portray in accurate 
and convincing form the conditions as found in 
heavily infected regions in the Southern States, 
and the work which is being done for the relief 
and control of the disease. ‘The same story was 
told by means of a stereomotorgraph, electrically 
operated, which automatically threw on a screen 
a series of colored slides, each bearing its own 
legend. And these were supplemented by charts, 
maps, and exhibits in three dimensions. ‘Two 
attendants who had had large experience in the 
work in Kentucky had charge of the exhibit 
throughout the nine months of the Exposition; 
they gave lectures, distributed literature, and 
operated a laboratory where persons were exam- 
ined and the technique of microscopic diagnosis 
was illustrated. 
The attendance from the first day was un- 
usually large, making it necessary to double the 
space originally provided. The exhibit was well 
received and was awarded a grand prize. At 
the close of the San Francisco Exposition the 
exhibit was removed intact to Washington and 
installed in the Army Medical Museum, where 
it is open to the public as a permanent exhibit.

Collection of Information on Uncinariasis 
The Commission is engaged in collecting in- 
formation on the subject of uncinariasis, or hook- 
worm. disease, in all countries. It is especially 
interested in the geographical distribution of the 
disease, the degree of infection in the infected 
areas, and the methods which are being employed 
for its relief and control. Considerable infor- 
mation has already been brought together and 
made available by classification and index. This 
information is being collected primarily for the 
guidance of the Commission; it is desired, 
nevertheless, that the information may be avail- 
able to all persons who are: interested in this 
subject. The bibliography is far from com- 
plete, but such information as has been collected 
is at the service of persons who may be interested 
in any particular phase of the subject. Infor- 
mation has been supplied, for example, to cor- 
porations which are interested in the control of 
uncinariasis in mines. The Commission would 
be glad to establish relations with persons and 
organizations that may be working in this field 
in any part of the world, with a view to the 
exchange of information and of bibliographical 
or other available material. 
II 
MEASURES AGAINST YELLOW FEVER 
Prior to the work of Reed and the Army Com- 
mission in Havana, yellow fever was regarded
-P-A-G-E-69
  GENERAL SUMMARY 60 
as one of the great plagues. For more than 200 
years the tropical and sub-tropical regions of 
America had been subject to devastating epi- 
demics of the infection, while serious outbreaks 
had occurred as far north as Philadelphia and 
Boston, and as far away from the endemic 
centers as Spain, France, England, and Italy. 
During this period appalling epidemics swept 
repeatedly over the West Indies, Central Amer- 
ica, and the Southern United States, decimating 
populations, paralyzing industry and trade, and 
holding the people of these regions in a state of 
perpetual dread. It is estimated, for example, 
that the epidemic which visited the Mississippi 
valley in 1878 caused 13,000 deaths and an 
economic loss of more than $100,000,000 re- 
sulting from paralysis of business, and each suc- 
ceeding summer brought with it the possibility 
of a repetition of the experience. 
The discovery of Reed and his Yellow Fever 
Commission has made the control of the infection 
possible. So far as the United States is con- 
cerned the fangs of yellow fever have been drawn. 
Its eradication from Havana removed the chief 
source of danger. Cases may continue to appear 
from time to time on the Southern coast, but 
since the control of the recent epidemic in New 
Orleans the people of the States have lost their 
dread of yellow fever as a scourge. In the 
countries south of the United States, however, 
it is still the source of constant anxiety. The
-P-A-G-E-70
  70 INTERNATIONAL HEALTH COMMISSION 
coast of Brazil, the Amazon valley, the Carib- 
bean region, and the west coast of South America 
from Peru to Mazatlan, Mexico, are subject to 
invasion at all seasons. Throughout this region 
yellow fever is the subject of constant vigilance 
on the part of quarantine officers, and is a serious 
handicap to commerce and to the general eco- 
nomic development of these countries. 
Great anxiety is felt throughout the East on 
account of the possibility of the introduction of 
yellow fever into that region as a result of the 
opening of the Panama Canal. The Canal has 
wrought radical changes in trade relations. 
Countries and ports between which there had 
been little or no exchange have been brought into 
close relation. Pest-holes of infection that have 
been relatively harmless because of their isola- 
tion are now on or near the world’s highway of 
commerce and travel. As early as 1903 Manson 
called attention to the grave risk of conveying 
infection to the Far East as a result of the open- 
ing of the Canal. Dr. James, of the Indian 
Medical Service, who was employed by his 
Government to make a thorough investigation 
of the subject, reports that the menace is suffi- 
ciently great to call for a permanent quarantine 
force to be maintained in Panama, Hong Kong, 
or Singapore at the expense of the English col- 
onies in the East, and recommends to the Indian 
Government a systematic attack on the Stego- 
myia mosquito. It is recognized by sanitarians
-P-A-G-E-71
GENERAL SUMMARY ge 
that if the infection should once be introduced 
into the Orient, with its dense population of 
non-immunes, the ill resulting from it would be 
incalculable. 
Sanitarians hold that the endemic foci are the 
seed-beds of infection, and that if these seed- 
beds be destroyed the disease will disappear 
from all other points. Fortunately, these seed- 
beds are few in number. There are probably 
not more than five or six endemic foci all told, 
so that the problem of eradicating yellow fever 
reduces itself to the problem of stamping it out 
at these five or six points. The work done by 
General Gorgas at Havana and Panama, and 
by Oswaldo Cruz at Rio Janeiro, has demon- 
strated that the disease can be exterminated in 
such endemic centers and has given ground for 
the belief that its complete eradication is a 
feasible undertaking. 
Acting on this belief by sanitarians that the 
eradication of yellow fever is feasible, the Inter- 
national Health Commission has undertaken to 
carry out a preliminary investigation to deter- 
mine how far conditions warrant and invite 
further definite activity in this direction. After 
months of delay due to war conditions, the 
membership of a Yellow Fever Commission has 
been practically completed, and it is expected 
that this Commission, with General Gorgas at 
its head, will visit the infected regions during 
the coming year for the purpose of determining
-P-A-G-E-72
2 INTERNATIONAL HEALTH COMMISSION 
the doubtful endemic centers, and of ascertain- 
ing what measures may be necessary and 
feasible for the eradication of the infection in 
those communities on which the responsibility 
for the presence and spread of yellow fever is 
found to rest. 
II 
MEASURES AGAINST MALARIA 
Because of its wide geographical distribution, 
its extreme prevalence over vast tropical and 
sub-tropical regions, where in places it is re- 
sponsible for more sickness and death than all 
other diseases. combined, and because of its 
obvious effects in the form of direct financial 
loss, impaired economic efficiency, and retarded 
physical and mental development, malaria is to 
be regarded as presenting the most serious 
medical and sanitary problem with which we 
have to contend. It strongly resembles hook- 
worm disease in its wide distribution and in the 
fact that it is an anemia-producing disease most 
prevalent among children, and therefore prey- 
ing upon the race most heavily during the period 
of physical and mental growth. 
This general consideration led the Commis- 
sion to take up the subject of malaria early 
in July of the current year, with a view to as- 
certaining whether the control of this disease 
might offer a field of service with promise of 
definite and far-reaching results. ‘The inquiry
-P-A-G-E-73
  GENERAL SUMMARY 8 
covered such phases of the subject as the geo- 
graphical distribution of malaria, the degree of 
infection in certain localities in various parts of 
the world, the significance of malaria as a dis- 
abling disease, the principles underlying all con- 
trol measures, and the methods and results of 
a large number of systematic efforts that have 
been made under widely different conditions for 
its control. 
Theoretically, the control of malaria is rela- 
tively simple, but as a practical undertaking it 
has been found extremely difficult. In view of 
the important interests at stake, however, the 
International Health Commission is undertak- 
ing to carry out an experiment with a view to 
ascertaining what degree of control may be 
achieved in our temperate climate within the 
limits of reasonable expenditure and under the 
conditions which prevail in typical farming com- 
munities in the Southern States. Arrangements 
have been made to carry out two sets of ex- 
periments: one to test the practicability of 
malaria control by detecting the carriers and 
freeing them of the parasites; and the other to 
test the practicability of malaria control by 
means of a combination of control measures. 
In neither case is the extermination of mos- 
quitoes by major drainage operations to be 
undertaken. 
The first of these experiments is to be carried 
out in Bolivar county, Mississippi, under the  
-P-A-G-E-74
  “4 INTERNATIONAL HEALTH COMMISSION 
administration of the Mississippi Department 
of Health, with Dr. W. S. Leathers as Adminis- 
trative Director, and Dr. C. C. Bass, of Tulane 
University Medical School, as Scientific Direc- 
tor. The field force and the microscopists have 
been selected and are now receiving their tech- 
nical training in the laboratory of Tulane Uni- 
versity Medical School under Dr. Bass. The 
second experiment is to be carried out in Arkan- 
sas in cooperation with the U. S. Public Health 
Service, with Dr. R. H. von Ezdorf in charge. 
The field force is being made up, the budget has 
been approved, and it is expected that work in 
the field will be under way by the middle of 
March or the first of April. 
The work undertaken is frankly an experi- 
ment; the practical difficulties to be encountered 
are serious; the future development of the work 
therefore must depend upon the results of the 
present undertaking. 
IV 
MEDICAL COMMISSION TO BRAZIL 
In view of its interest in the promotion 
of public sanitation and the spread of the 
knowledge of scientific medicine, the Interna- 
tional Health Commission is undertaking, for 
guidance in its present and future work, to 
secure information on medical conditions in 
many countries. From British colonies, and 
from many other countries which have been
-P-A-G-E-75
GENERAL SUMMARY 7 
visited by representatives of the Commission, 
considerable information has already been 
secured concerning medical and public health 
agencies, and it is expected that these prelimi- 
nary studies will be followed by more detailed 
investigation to be carried out on the ground. 
As a beginning in this direction arrangements 
have been made to send a special commission 
to Brazil to study and report on medical con- 
ditions and progress in that country. This 
commission is expected to sail about the middle 
of January, 1916. Its studies are to cover the 
ground of medical education, hospitals, dispen- 
saries, prevalent diseases, public health agencies, 
and sanitary progress. The Government of 
Brazil extends hearty welcome to the commis- 
sion and generously offers every facility for the 
prosecution of its work.

HOSPITAL SHIP FOR THE SULU ARCHIPELAGO 
For more than two hundred years efforts have 
been made, principally through the use of mili- 
tary force, to bring the Moros and near-related 
tribes who inhabit the Sulu Archipelago under 
the influence of civilization. The military forces 
of Spain were unable to accomplish this, and 
similar efforts made by the United States have 
not met with much greater success. The Sulu 
Archipelago, composing the southern group of 
 
-P-A-G-E-76
  76 INTERNATIONAL HEALTH COMMISSION 
the Philippines, comprises a large number of 
small islands. These are inhabited by about 
200,000 persons of the Mohammedan faith who 
lead a nomadic or semi-nomadic life. The 
Moros since their entry into history have been 
a people apart. They were the famous Malay 
pirates that terrorized the Malay seas and dev- 
astated the Philippine Islands to the north. 
Religious hatred and war-like proclivities have 
separated the Moros politically and socially 
from the great mass of the Filipinos, who fear 
them. The Moro is a man of good physique, 
quick mind, and of active habits, but he has 
been so alienated from the rest of the world 
that the benefits of civilization have never 
reached him. Preliminary investigation shows 
that the medical needs of these people are great. 
They suffer from malnutrition and from diseases 
fostered by filth and negligence. ‘The common 
diseases are skin diseases in their worst forms, 
malaria, hookworm disease, dysentery, and some 
of the other preventable infections. 
The Ifugaos, Kalingaos, Igorots, and other 
human-head-hunting tribes of northern Luzon, 
were brought to ways of peace largely by the 
contact established through medical relief. Sim- 
ilar work has been recently undertaken among 
the Moros, who live in the larger islands of 
Mindanao and Jolo, and it is believed that this 
effort will meet with the same success which has 
attended the pacification work of the tribes of
-P-A-G-E-77
GENERAL SUMMARY 7 
Luzon. It is already possible for the doctor 
and nurse to go in safety to many places which 
it has been extremely dangerous for the soldier 
to approach. Experience has shown that even 
the wildest of the Moros that have resisted all 
other means of contact may be appealed to 
through hospital relief. ‘The medical work done 
in Mindanao is paving the way for establishing 
industrial and regular schools, and indicates that 
these people, when properly approached, show 
a receptive attitude toward civilizing influences. 
The establishment of dispensaries at different 
places in the Sulu Archipelago similar to those 
in Mindanao and Jolo is not practicable because 
they would reach only a very small fraction of 
the inhabitants, who are scattered over a large 
number of small islands. But these people can 
be reached by a hospital ship. They are gregari- 
ous; they live along the littoral, and the markets 
where the people congregate at least weekly 
bring the whole population to the coast. To 
meet the situation a hospital ship is being pro- 
vided. The hospital ship will be expected to 
go from island to island, meeting the people at 
established points, bringing medical relief to the 
afflicted, training midwives, giving general in- 
struction to the people, and guiding and stimu- 
lating them to self-help. It is expected that 
this hospital ship will serve as an agency for the 
promotion of peace and order, that it will help 
to establish friendly relations between the Fili-  
-P-A-G-E-78
  78 INTERNATIONAL HEALTH COMMISSION 
pinos and their Moro neighbors, and that it will 
serve as an entering wedge for permanent civ- 
ilizing influences. The International Health 
Commission has entered into a codperative 
arrangement with the Philippine Government 
for the equipment of such a ship and for its 
maintenance for a period of five years. It is 
expected that by the end of this period the ship 
will have demonstrated its usefulness and that 
the work will be continued on the basis of Gov- 
ernment and local support.

II. SUMMARY OF ACTIVITIES AND 
RESULTS BY STATES AND 
COUNTRIES 
ALL COUNTRIES 
In the states and countries where measures 
against hookworm disease have been in prog- 
ress, 1,458,483 persons were microscopically 
examined by the official working staff during 
the period from January I, 1910, to December 
31, 1915, and 593,383 persons were treated. 
The results by both the dispensary and inten- 
sive plans of work are included in these fig- 
ures. In addition to the persons examined and 
treated by the working force, however, large 
numbers were examined and treated by prac- 
ticing physicians, by hospitals, and by other 
agencies. Reports received from practicing 
physicians in the Southern States, for example, 
showed that during the period from January 
I, 1910, to December 31, 1915, 260,746 per- 
sons had been treated by them for hookworm 
disease. 
Table I exhibits the total number of persons 
microscopically examined and given first treat- 
ment by the working force in all countries up 
to December 31, 1915. The results accom-

1915. For Grenada and Costa Rica the per- 
centage of the persons examined who were found 
infected, and the percentage of infected persons 
who were given first treatment, have been 
omitted because the figures for the results of 
examination in these countries relate to the 
number of specimens, instead of to the number 
of persons, examined. In Grenada, further- 
more, and in Egypt, treatment was adminis- 
tered on clinical diagnosis to some persons who 
had not been examined and found positive 
with the microscope. The percentage figures 
for the total and sub-totals by geographical 
divisions are also affected by these considera- 
tions.

      Examination and Treatment: Intensive Method 
For all of the countries where intensive 
work has been conducted from the inaugura- 
tion of work by that plan on March 12, 1914, 
up to December 31, 1915, the total number of  
-P-A-G-E-84
  84 INTERNATIONAL HEALTH COMMISSION 
persons microscopically examined, found in- 
fected, given first treatment, and cured is 
exhibited in Table V. It will be seen that in 
all of the areas where work by this plan has 
been conducted, there resided 86,958 persons. 
Of these, 68,443, or 78.7 per cent, were micro- 
scopically examined; and 30,655, or 44.6 per 
cent of those examined, were found infected. 
First treatment was administered to 28,303, or 
92.3 per cent of those found infected; and 17,863, 
or 63.1 per cent of those receiving first treat- 
ment, were shown by microscopic re-examina- 
tion to have been cured. A comparison of the 
results during 1915 with those during 1914 is 
offered in the table.

The detailed results of examination and 
treatment by the intensive method during 1915 
are exhibited in Table VI. In this table the 
figures for the West Indies give a more reliable 
index to the effectiveness of work by the inten- 
sive plan in the relief and cure of sufferers than 
do the figures for the Southern States, where 
the staff devoted its main energies to secur- 
ing sanitary improvement. (See Table VI, 
page 86.) 
In all of the areas where work was conducted 
in the West Indies during 1915, 23,247 persons 
were found infected. Table VI shows that 
16,278 were cured. This represents 70.0 per 
cent of the total infected. In addition, 2,249, 
or 9.7 per cent of the infected persons, removed 
from the areas while the work was in progress, 
leaving in the areas uncured at the close of 
work, 4,720 infected persons, or 20.3 per cent 
of the total. Of these, 2,574 refused either to 
accept first treatment or to continue treatment 
until cured, 822 could not be treated for medical 
reasons, and 1,324 were under treatment but 
had not been treated a sufficient number of 
times for a cure to be effected when the work 
in the areas was ended. 
Table VII presents a brief summary showing 
the total number of infected persons remaining 
uncured in the areas where intensive work was 
conducted in the West Indies during 1915. (See

Figures for the West Indian colonies showing 
in detail the results of examination and treat- 
ment in the areas where work was conducted 
by the intensive method during 1915 are exhib- 
ited in Table VIII. (See Table VIII, page 87.) 
The figures given in the foregoing tables for 
the number of persons remaining in the areas 
uncured at the close of work are based in all 
cases upon the number of persons definitely 
known to have been infected. The actual 
number of persons remaining uncured will 
probably be greater in every instance than the 
tables show, for two reasons: first, a certain pro- 
portion of the persons who, for various reasons, 
were not examined were doubtless infected; and 
secondly, allowance must be made for errors and 
faulty technique in the microscopic examination 
of specimens. All of the tables in this report 
are confined to figures definitely known; esti- 
mated figures in all cases have been excluded. 
In figuring the percentage of persons remaining 
in the areas uncured at the close of work, the 
original number of infected cases, and not the 
total population of the areas, is taken as the 
base. If figures for the total population were 
used as the basis of calculation, the percentage 
of uncured persons remaining in the areas would 
be considerably lower. In order to arrive at 
the percentage of uncured persons based upon 
the population, however, it is necessary to take 
into consideration a number of estimated factors.
-P-A-G-E-89
  ALL COUNTRIES > 89 
The number of persons cured is based upon 
the number of persons previously infected in 
whose feces no ova could be detected on the last 
examination. In considering these figures two 
things should be borne in mind: first, in a large 
number of cases, re-examinations for demonstrat- 
ing whether a cure has been effected are lacking; 
and secondly, allowance must be made for the 
possibility of error in examining specimens. In 
some cases a patient may be infected, but a 
careful search may fail to'reveal ova in his stool. 
The number of such cases will depend upon the 
thoroughness of the microscopic technique, but in 
any event will be relatively small and will apply 
only to those persons who are lightly infected. 
The terms “Not Treated for Medical Rea- 
sons” and “Not Cured for Medical Reasons,” 
as used in the tables exhibiting the detailed re- 
sults of work by the intensive method, relate to 
very old or emaciated persons, pregnant women, 
or sufferers from acute heart or kidney disease, 
typhoid fever, malaria, dysentery, or diarrhoea. 
To administer treatment for hookworm disease 
to these persons might cause serious complica- 
tions and possibly death. Consequently the 
treatment is spoken of as withheld for medical 
reasons. 
Persons who have taken one or more treat- 
ments for hookworm disease, but have aban- 
doned treatment before being cured, are classed 
as “Refused” in the tables exhibiting detailed 
   
-P-A-G-E-90
  90 INTERNATIONAL HEALTH COMMISSION 
results. The persons who refuse treatment may 
be divided into two groups: those who refuse 
to accept even the first treatment, and those 
who accept one or more treatments but do not 
continue treatment until cured. Persons who 
die within the areas of operation while the work 
is in progress are included in the heading “Re- 
moved from Area.” In no case on record was 
the death of any of these persons connected 
with the administration of treatment for hook- 
worm disease. 
Sanitary Improvement 
In all of the states and countries where in- 
tensive work has been conducted, efforts to 
secure sanitary improvement have been given 
due attention. This feature of the work has 
received particular emphasis in the Southern 
States, and the results accomplished there are 
more adequately discussed in later pages. In 
Guatemala and Costa Rica, too, though the 
work has followed the dispensary plan, the work- 
ing staff has devoted much of its time to securing 
the installation and maintenance of satisfactory 
latrines. Elsewhere the work has been largely 
educational or persuasive in character, and the 
results have not been such as could be definitely 
measured and recorded. 
In the countries, besides Guatemala,’ where 
1Jn Guatemala the results have been reported on a basis. somewhat 
different from the other countries. They are discussed separately in 
the section of this chapter devoted to that country (see pages 174-176).

definite progress has been made in the improve- 
ment of sanitary conditions, 24,956 homes were 
inspected during the period from March 12, 1914, 
to December 31, 1915. Of these, only 8,128, or 
32.6 per cent, were found to have latrines on the 
first inspection, as compared with 13,909, or 
55-7 per cent, on the last. The actual number 
of new latrines installed was 5,781, reducing 
the percentage of homes without latrines from 
67.4 to 44.3. 
These results are exhibited in Table IX, in 
which a comparison is offered of the results 
during 1915 and prior to 1915.

SOUTHERN STATES 
During 1915, the state boards of health in 
ten Southern states conducted measures for the 
relief and control of hookworm disease. In 
three of the states—Alabama, Georgia, and 
Texas—work was conducted by the dispensary 
plan only; in five—Louisiana, Mississippi, North 
Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia—by the 
intensive plan only; and in two—Kentucky and 
Tennessee—by both the dispensary and inten- 
sive plans. The work was in progress continu- 
ously during the year in the states of Kentucky, 
Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee, and 
Virginia. Table 1 shows, for both the dispen- 
sary and intensive plans of work, the length of 
time operations were in progress in each state 
during 1915. (See Table 1, page 94.) 
Examination and Treatment: Dispensary Method 
Prior to 1915, operations by the dispensary 
method had been conducted by all of these 
states and by Arkansas. This work succeeded 
in reaching almost all of the heavily infected 
counties in these states, so that at the begin- 
ning of 1915 there remained only a few coun- 
ties still to be visited by dispensaries. ‘These 
counties were located in the states of Alabama, 
Kentucky, Tennessee, and Texas. During 1915 
the work was extended to them. Table 2 shows, 
by states, the extent of operations conducted by

    In the dispensary work conducted up to 
December 31, I915, 1,217,483 persons were 
microscopically examined, of whom 396,725, 
or 32.6 per cent, were found to be infected. 
First treatment was administered to 477,427 
persons, 80,702 in excess of those found infected. 
This excess of persons treated over those 
found infected is due to the fact that in the 
early work a great many patients who had not

been examined with the microscope were given 
treatment on clinical diagnosis. Table 3 ex-

    Examination and Treatment: Intensive Method 
During 1914 the intensive plan had been tried 
out in certain states which had been earliest in 
completing the dispensary work; in that year, 
work by this plan had been completed in twelve 
communities, three located in the state of 
Louisiana, six in North Carolina, two in South 
Carolina, and one in Virginia. With the com- 
pletion of dispensary work during 1915 in the 
heavily infected counties of the other states, 
came the final transition from the dispensary 
to the intensive plan of work. In the year 1915, 
work by the intensive plan was completed in 
fifty-nine additional communities, making the 
total number of communities in which work had
-P-A-G-E-101
  SOUTHERN STATES 101 
been completed up to December 31, 1915, 
seventy-one. Table 9 shows, by states, the 
number of communities completed during 1915 
and during 1914.

The chief aim of the intensive work as con- 
ducted by these states has been to see that 
adequate sanitary accommodations are provided 
for rural homes. Upon the curative side of the 
work no particular stress has been laid, because 
in almost all of the communities the infection 
existing when the intensive work was under- 
taken was found to be light, due no doubt to 
the efforts of the practicing physicians and in 
part to the dispensary work, with its accom- 
panying educational activities, which had been 
previously conducted.

there resided 46,163 persons. Of these, 29,684, 
or 64.3 per cent, were microscopically examined; 
and 7,408, or 25.0 per cent, were found to be 
infected. First treatment was administered to

Sanitary Improvement 
In the work directed toward the improvement 
of sanitation, upon which chief emphasis is laid 
in the intensive work conducted in the Southern 
States, the progress made up to December 31, 
1915, in having latrines provided at the farm 
homes is exhibited in Table 12. In the sev- 
enty-one communities in which the work was 
conducted there were 9,393 homes. On the first 
inspection of the premises, it was found that 
only 4,631, or 49.3 per cent, were provided with 
latrines of any kind, and many of these were 
entirely inadequate for preventing soil pollution. 
On the last inspection, latrines were found at

from 50.7 to 22.1. (See Table 12, page 104.) 
In Table 13 figures are presented showing, 
by states, the progress made during 1915 in 
having latrines provided at the farm homes. 
(See Table 13, page 106.) 
In neither table, however, do the figures 
convey an adequate impression of the real ex- 
tent to which the sanitation of these communities 
has been improved. In addition to the new 
latrines erected, many that were of a crude type 
have been improved and made adequate for 
‘preventing soil pollution. Nor do the figures 
take into account the number of new latrines 
erected or old ones improved at schools, churches, 
and other public and private buildings not clas- 
sified as homes; nor the improvement made at 
homes located outside the limits of the particular 
communities in which the work was conducted. 
It has been found everywhere that the influence 
of the work radiates into the surrounding terri- 
tory and that many latrines are installed at 
homes not included within the community 
survey, and many persons examined and treated 
who reside outside of the community. It has 
been found also that many families which were 
unable, from one cause or another, to install or 
improve latrines at their homes while the work

was going on, make the necessary improvement 
after the work has been completed. Of incidental 
results such as these, the figures in the tables 
take no account. 
The by-products of the work, one may ven- 
ture to think, are even more important than 
the control of hookworm disease. While being 
taught how to control this one disease the people 
are also instructed in the prevention of typhoid, 
and are shown that in putting a stop to soil 
pollution to prevent hookworm disease they are 
at the same time preventing the spread of 
typhoid and other enteric diseases. Incidentally 
they are also shown the dangers of the fly in 
spreading typhoid and of the mosquito in 
spreading malaria; and as a result of this com- 
munity work they become active in screening 
against flies and mosquitoes, although the 
primary effort has centered not on the screening 
but on the building of latrines. In teaching the 
people by demonstration how to control this 
one disease, an object lesson is given in the con- 
trol of disease. Already this work has identified 
itself strongly with the movement for improve- 
ment in rural hygiene and sanitation, and as the 
outcome one may foresee the whole-time county 
health officer directing local agencies for the 
control of disease at the farm homes as disease 
is now being controlled in the larger towns and 
cities.

108 INTERNATIONAL HEALTH COMMISSION 
ANTIGUA 
A preliminary survey for determining the 
prevalence and effects of hookworm disease in - 
Antigua was conducted by Dr. Eric Marshall 
from August 1, 1914, to November 27, 1914. 
This investigation showed that in certain dis- 
tricts a large percentage of the people were 
infected, that the disease was the cause of much 
sickness, and that under certain conditions it 
might become a menace to the health of the 
whole Island. Its distribution led to the belief 
that it could be readily dealt with by work of 
an intensive nature. Arrangements were made 
for beginning work, and Dr. P. W. Covington, 
who had been appointed Director, began active 
measures against the disease on September 15, 
19Is. : 
The intensive plan of work was selected for 
preliminary operations. To assist the Director, 
a staff composed of two microscopists, three 
nurses and assistant nurses, a varying number 
of supernumerary nurses, and a caretaker, was 
appointed. 
Examination and Treatment 
Up to December 31, 1915, operations had been 
confined to the York Valley District. In this 
area, roughly two miles in diameter, were 
included ten villages, with a combined popu- 
lation of 1,956 persons, of whom almost all are 
negroes.
-P-A-G-E-109
  ANTIGUA 109 
Work in this area had not been completed up 
to December 31, 1915, but 1,921 persons, or 98.2 
per cent of the inhabitants, had been examined. 
Of these, 524, or 27.3 per cent, were found in- 
fected; and 432, or 82.4 per cent of those infected, 
were given first treatment. By microscopic re- 
examination following treatment, 284 persons 
(65.7 per cent of those treated) were found to 
have been cured. ‘These details are shown more 
clearly in Table 1.

Since one of the aims of intensive work is to 
leave in the area as few uncured persons as 
possible as foci of infection, Table 2 gives

Educational Work 
When the work was undertaken in the York 
Valley District an inaugural meeting was held 
at which His Excellency, the Acting Governor
-P-A-G-E-111
         it 
  ANTIGUA 
of Antigua, presided. A number of addresses 
illustrated by lantern slides, telling in detail 
the story of the disease, were delivered at this 
meeting. In the work up to December 31, 1915, 
sixteen lectures were delivered and approxi- 
mately 2,000 circulars distributed. Included 
among the lectures were a number of illustrated 
talks delivered at the schoolhouses throughout 
the area. 
Sanitary Improvement 
The nurses in visiting the homes to take the 
census, make a note of the sanitary conditions 
found. In the York Valley District, out of 413 
homes, only ten were found to be provided with 
satisfactory latrines. Measures of sanitary 
improvement, such as draining and clearing the 
ground of undergrowth around the villages and 
erecting suitable latrines to prevent further soil 
pollution, are in the hands of the Government 
of Antigua. Sanitary inspectors have been ap- 
pointed to enforce the installation and proper 
maintenance of suitable latrines, but no definite 
results had been accomplished up to December 
31, 1915. ‘There was, however, every evidence 
that activities would soon be under way,

Operations against hookworm disease in 
British Guiana are in charge of Dr. F. E. Field, 
the Supervising Medical Officer, who acts un- 
der the direction of the Surgeon General. The 
Government Medical Officers of the districts 
in which work has been conducted have given 
much advice and assistance. 
Preliminary operations were undertaken in the 
Peter’s Hall district, lying on the east bank of the 
Demerara river just south of Georgetown. 
Active work was begun on March 12, 1914, and 
continued until March 31, 1915. Meanwhile, 
on January 9, 1915, operations were begun in 
the Belle Vue district, lying on the west bank of 
the Demerara river opposite the Peter’s Hall 
district. Work in this second area had been 
practically completed by September 15, 1915. 
Work in a third area was then begun but had 
not been completed by December 31, 1915; 
hence, the figures in this report are confined to 
the results accomplished in the Peter’s Hall and 
Belle Vue districts. 
For the sake of convenience in operation, both 
the Peter’s Hall and Belle Vue districts were 
sub divided into three areas termed A, B, and C. 
In mapping out the areas consideration was given 
to natural boundaries, and effort was made so far 
as possible to divide the districts into areas having 
approximately the same number of inhabitants.
-P-A-G-E-113
  BRITISH GUIANA 113 
The Peter’s Hall district is about eight miles 
long and from one to three miles wide. It has 
villages and sugar plantations on both sides of 
one long road. There are few isolated houses. 
The work was confined to the free population, 
numbering 10,380 persons of the East Indian, 
colored, black, Portuguese, and Chinese races. 
Indentured laborers on sugar plantations were 
excluded because they were being effectively 
treated by the Government Medical Officer at 
the expense of the plantation owners. The staff 
engaged in the Peter’s Hall district consisted 
of the supervising medical officer, two clerks, 
twelve nurses and twenty-four assistant nurses, 
three microscopists, and three caretakers. 
The Belle Vue district is about fourteen miles 
long, with villages and sugar plantations on both 
sides of a public road. At a point near the cen- 
ter of this road another road about eight miles 
in length, with villages and plantations on both 
sides, branches off from it. As in the Peter’s 
Hall district, the work was confined to the free 
population living in villages. This population 
numbered 11,943, including negroes, East In- 
dians, persons of mixed blood, Chinese, and 
Europeans. In the Belle Vue district the staff, 
in addition to the supervising medical officer, 
consisted of four clerks, four microscopists, 
eleven nurses and twenty-three assistant nurses, 
and three caretakers. Headquarters for the 
supervising medical officer, the clerks, and three
-P-A-G-E-114
14 INTERNATIONAL HEALTH COMMISSION 
of the microscopists were established in the 
center of the district; a fourth microscopist was 
stationed in the extreme southern part; and 
smaller dispensaries attended by nurses and 
their assistants, with a microscopist whenever 
occasion demanded, were located in the principal 
villages. 
Lying at a lower level than the high tides of 
the Demerara river on which it is located; 
abounding in dense vegetation; completely 
inundated during the rainy season and in 
certain sections during the greater part of the 
year, the Belle Vue district offers conditions 
ideal for the perpetuation of hookworm disease, 
fevers, and other maladies. It was selected 
because it was one of the most unsanitary 
districts in the colony, almost unrivaled in 
its high death rate, and a constant menace 
to the city of Georgetown because malaria, 
hookworm disease, and dysentery had long 
flourished in it. 
Examination and Treatment 
The combined village population ofthe Peter’s 
Hall and Belle Vue districts was 22,323. Of 
these, 21,070, or 94.4. per cent, were microscopi- 
cally examined; and 13,135, or 62.3 per cent, 
were found infected. First treatment was ad- 
ministered to 11,903, or 90.6 per cent of the 
infected persons; and 10,039, or 84.3 per cent 
of those receiving first treatment, were kept
-P-A-G-E-115

under treatment until cured. Table 1 presents 
these figures itemized for each district.

  It will be seen that the percentage of infection 
was higher in the Belle Vue than in the Peter’s 
Hall district, being 65.4 per cent as compared 
with 58.6 per cent. In the number and per- 
centage of infected persons cured, the work in 
the Belle Vue district exceeded that in the 
Peter’s Hall: in the former, the staff succeeded 
in curing 87.9 per cent of the infected persons; 
in the latter, 79.6 per cent. 
In the two districts combined there were 1,682 
infected persons, or 12.8 per cent of the total 
infected, who could not be cured for various  
-P-A-G-E-116
  116 INTERNATIONAL HEALTH COMMISSION 
reasons: in the Peter’s Hall district the infected 
persons remaining uncured represented 13.7 per 
cent of the total infected persons; in the Belle 
Vue district, 12.2 per cent. The largest single 
group of these 1,682 infected persons were the 
QII persons who were under treatment but had 
not been treated a sufficient number of times 
before the close of the work for a cure to be 
effected. The health of practically all of these 
persons was undoubtedly much benefited as. a 
result of treatment; in many, perhaps, only the 
microscopic demonstration of cure was lacking. 
There were also 498 infected persons who could 
not be cured for medical reasons and 273 who 
refused either to accept first treatment or to 
continue treatment until cured. Figures show- 
ing the number of persons remaining uncured in

members of the legislature, the clergy, local

public meetings have also been held from time 
to time, and special lectures have been delivered 
to school-teachers and school-children, and to 
persons of other classes. An idea of the extent 
of the educational work conducted in both areas 
may be gained from Table 4, which indicates 
that a total of 42 lectures, attended by 9,911 
persons, was delivered in both districts.

Sanitary Improvement 
To secure the necessary improvement in sani- 
tation the Government maintains a staff of 
native sanitary inspectors trained in the sani- 
tary institute at Georgetown. These subordi- 
nate inspectors work under the direct supervision 
of a Chief Sanitary Inspector brought out from 
England. The staff engaged in sanitary im- 
provement is entirely distinct from that engaged 
in examination and treatment, but both are 
under the direction of the Surgeon General. 
Laws are in existence requiring the erection of 
suitable latrines, but so far as possible the  
-P-A-G-E-120
  120 INTERNATIONAL HEALTH COMMISSION 
voluntary cooperation of the people is relied 
upon for sanitary improvement. 
Table 6 indicates that of the 6,147 homes 
inspected in the two districts where work was 
conducted, on the first inspection only 2,524, or 
41.1 per cent, were found to be provided with 
latrines, whereas on the last inspection 3,918 
homes, or 63.7 per cent of the total, had been 
provided. ‘This means that during the progress 
of the work 1,394 new latrines were erected, and 
the sanitary work is stillunderway. (See Table 
6, page 121.) 
The table, however, does not show the actual 
extent of sanitary work conducted. In addition 
to the homes at which new latrines were erected, 
many other homes already provided with latrines 
were required to improve them to conform to the 
type adopted as standard. Main and interlot 
drains also were cleaned out; vats and barrels 
screened; dense overhanging bush and unneces- 
sary vegetation cleared away; many unsanitary 
buildings removed; bakehouses and provision 
shops cleaned and re-constructed; accumulations 
of rubbish removed; and ventilation improved. 
In one district the villagers were so enthusiastic 
about the work and realized so well the benefits 
to be derived from it that they levied upon them- 
selves an additional tax to pay for a special 
sanitary inspector.

disease, the Surgeon General writes: “It may 
be of interest to know that from the Peter’s Hail 
and Belle Vue districts, where the work has been 
conducted, the number of persons seeking 
medical relief at the public hospital at George- 
town has been much reduced, whereas from the 
city and from the country districts where the 
work has not been conducted the number has 
increased.”

DUTCH GUIANA 123 
DUTCH GUIANA 
Late in December, 1914, the Commission’s 
Director for the West Indies on invitation 
visited Dutch Guiana and discussed with the 
Surgeon General and other members of the 
Colonial Medical Staff, plans for conducting 
measures against hookworm disease. Many 
estates and hospitals were inspected; clinical 
examination made of several hundred people; 
and every evidence found of a high rate of in- 
fection. The Colonial Government thereupon 
invited the Commission to aid in combating the 
disease, and in April, 1915, signified its readi- 
ness to have the work begin. Dr. W. H. Kibler 
was accordingly appointed Medical Officer in 
Charge of the work. He arrived at Paramaribo 
on October 2, and began active work on 
October 15, 1915. 
The intensive method was selected for pre- 
liminary operations. A staff of one clerk, two 
microscopists, two nurses and two assistant 
nurses, and a caretaker was engaged to assist 
the director. The nurses and microscopists 
had received preliminary training in the mili- 
tary hospital at Paramaribo, making it possi- 
ble to begin work without training these em- 
ployees. 
The Marienburg estate, located on the Com- 
mewyne river about ten miles from Paramaribo, 
was selected as the first district in which work

should be undertaken. This estate is the largest 
in the colony. It has a population of 2,380 per- 
sons, of whom 1,005 are Javanese, 894 East 
Indians, and 448 blacks. Both free and inden- 
tured labor is employed. The inhabited dis- 
trict on this estate covers less than one square 
mile. 
The estate management has shown every 
courtesy to the director and other members 
of the staff, and has rendered valuable assist- 
ance in carrying on the work. An office and 
laboratory for the director was provided free 
of charge in the estate hospital, and living 
quarters for all members of the force were 
furnished at small cost. The estate has also 
furnished, for a greater part of the time, 
a man to assist the nurses in giving treat- 
ment. 
Active work was begun on October 15 and 
was still in progress on December 31, 1915. 
Examination and Treatment 
Table 1 gives the total population of the 
Marienburg estate as 2,380 persons. Of these, 
2,322, or 97.6 per cent, had been examined up 
to December 31, 1915; and 1,942, or 83.6 per 
cent of those examined, were found to be in- 
fected. First treatment had been administered 
to 1,809 persons—93.2 per cent of those infected; 
and 492, or 27.2 per cent of those receiving first 
treatment, had been cured.

In considering these figures it should be borne 
in mind that the work had not been completed 
by December 31, 1915. ‘The number of infected 
persons remaining uncured will, of course, be 
reduced as the work progresses. 
Educational Work 
Before the work was undertaken, three pre- 
liminary meetings were held for interesting the 
people; a fourth was held after the work was 
under way. ‘Two of the meetings were for the 
East Indians, one for the Javanese, and one for 
the negroes. All were well attended, the atten- 
dance at the four being 2,500 persons. ‘Three 
of the lectures were illustrated by lantern slides. 
At one of the meetings the Governor, the Sur- 
geon General, and a number of prominent citi- 
zens of Paramaribo were in attendance.

  126 INTERNATIONAL HEALTH COMMISSION 
Sanitary Improvement 
As the work of examination and treatment 
progresses, the estate management is bringing 
about the necessary sanitary improvement. In 
a survey conducted at the beginning of the work 
it was found that of 201 houses located on the 
estate, 143, or 71.1 per cent, were emptying their 
sewage into trenches, some of which had water 
in them only during the rainy season and others 
only during the period when the sugar factory 
was running. The remaining 58 homes, or 28.8 
per cent of the total, had no provision for sew- 
age disposal and were contaminating the soil. 
Up to December 31, 1915, seven new latrines 
had been built to provide accommodations for 
27 houses, so that by December 31, 1915, the 
number of houses without latrines had been re- 
duced to 34, or 16.9 per cent of the total, and 
the number disposing of their sewage into 
trenches to 140, or 69.7 per cent of the total, 
Sanitary work in the area is still in progress.

Operations against hookworm disease in Gre- 
nada are in charge of Dr. Angus Macdonald, who 
works under the direction of the Surgeon General, 
with the assistance of a local Advisory Commit- 
tee. Besides the medical officer in charge, the 
staff consists of the assistant medical officer, one 
clerk, five microscopists, and a varying number 
of nurses and assistant nurses. 
The work may be said to be conducted by the 
dispensary plan. At first the widely scattered 
population and the agricultural pursuits of the 
people seemed to make it quite out of the ques- 
tion to attempt the thoroughgoing house-to- 
house visitation and treatment which character- 
izes the intensive method. Lately it has been 
found possible, by reducing the size of the 
areas, to approach more nearly the intensive 
plan of work. But the technique of micro- 
scopic examination still differs from that usually 
employed in intensive work, the nurses do not 
oversee the actual taking of the medicine in the 
homes of the patients, and considerable latitude 
is left for the patient to exercise his own judg- 
ment. For these reasons the Grenada work is 
classified throughout this report as being rather 
of the dispensary than of the intensive type. 
Active measures were begun on December 1, 
1914, with the central office located at St. 
George’s and branch laboratories at Mt. Moritz, 
 
-P-A-G-E-128
  128 INTERNATIONAL HEALTH COMMISSION 
Guoyave, Birch Grove, and St. Dominic’s, to 
which people were invited to come for free 
diagnosis and treatment. This plan of work 
was followed until February, 1915, when it was 
decided to restrict the field of operations to two 
areas: the first, known as the Mt. Moritz area, 
embracing about 7,000 acres in the parish of 
St. George’s; and the second, known as the St. 
David’s area, embracing about 12,000 acres in 
the parish of St. David’s. Work in these two 
districts continued to engage the attention of 
the staff until July, 1915, when work was begun 
in another area located in the parish of St. 
Andrew’s, contiguous on its southern boundary 
with the area previously worked in St. David’s. 
The St. Andrew’s area covers about 6,000 acres. 
The population to be handled was purposely 
limited to about 2,000, so that a closer approach 
to the intensive method might be made than was 
found possible in the other districts. Work in 
the St. Andrew’s area was still in progress on De- 
cember 31, 1915. In each of the old areas the 
work was not closed abruptly when operations 
were begun in a new area; instead, consider- 
able effort was made to continue the treatment 
of all persons in these areas who had not yet 
been cured. 
These three areas combined embrace approxi- 
mately one-third of the total area of the island 
and about one-sixth of the population. In the 
Mt. Moritz and St. David’s districts there are
-P-A-G-E-129
GRENADA 129 
few estates of any size—the people are mainly 
renters and small holders; but in the St. An- 
drew’s area large estates give labor to the bulk 
of the people, most of whom live on the hills 
above the estates. For the Mt. Moritz area 
the head office at St. George’s was the head- 
quarters; and for the St. David’s area the Gov- 
ernment Rest House in St. David’s. In Novem- 
ber, premises were secured for the staff at a 
central point in St. Andrew’s parish and head- 
quarters were established there for the work in 
that area. 
Each area was sub divided into districts, in 
each of which a school or barn served as a con- 
venient center for receiving patients, examining 
them personally, collecting their specimens, and 
giving them treatment. In general, house-to- 
house examination and distribution of medi- 
cine has not been carried out. The visits of 
the medical officers to the homes have been 
mainly educational or for purposes of general 
investigation. 
Examination and Treatment 
The results of the work of examination and 
treatment are exhibited in Table 1. The 
total population dealt with up to December 31, 
1915, was 16,001. ‘The actual number of per- 
sons examined is not known, as the early records 
kept for the work of examination at the head 
office and in the Mt. Moritz and St. David’s
-P-A-G-E-130
  130 INTERNATIONAL HEALTH COMMISSION 
areas related to the number of specimens and 
not to the number of persons. The number of 
specimens microscopically examined was 18,584, 
of which 11,194, or 60.2 per cent, were found 
positive. First treatment was administered to 
11,522 persons—328 in excess of the number of 
specimens found positive. In the early days of 
the work the acknowledged possibility of faulty 
diagnosis and the investigation of the action of 
drugs on other parasitic conditions made it seem 
advisable to treat many who were recorded as 
not infected. The actual number of persons 
treated to a cure as demonstrated by micro- 
scopic examination was 3,346, or 29.9 per cent 
of those who received first treatment. Figures 
in detail for each area are given in the table. 
(See Table 1, page 131.) 
The cocoa-growing districts, with their con- 
tinuous shade and almost persistent moisture, 
are the chief centers of infection. A comparison 
of the percentage of infection found in the Mt. 
Moritz area, wherein the cultivation is largely 
open, with that found in the St. David’s and 
St. Andrew’s areas, where dense cocoa cultiva- 
tion prevails, shows that in the first area only 
45 persons of every 100 were infected, whereas 
in the other two areas the average was 67. 
Of the last two areas, the percentage of in- 
fection in St. David’s was higher than in St. 
Andrew’s, being 72 as compared with 59 per 
cent.

Educational Work 
Illustrated lectures and demonstrations under 
the microscope were delivered regularly through- 
out the areas, and the schools were widely used 
for general publicity work. In the Mt. Moritz 
and St. David’s areas teachers were employed 
as part-time assistants. ‘They took the census, 
distributed medicine, and showed much interest 
in the educational features of the work. Litera- 
ture has also been freely distributed and as often 
as possible has been read to the people. In this 
way the educational activities have been kept 
persistently in the foreground. 
Table 2 gives an idea of the extent and 
nature of educational work conducted by means 
of lectures, and shows the number of persons 
who were in attendance.

itary inspector, working under the direction of 
the Colonial Surgeon, looked after the sanitary 
necessities of approximately 10,000 people. Since 
work was begun in the St. Andrew’s area, how- 
ever, three additional sanitary inspectors have 
been appointed to carry out general sanitary 
work, and especially to instruct the people in 
legal requirements for disposing of human 
excrement. 
Tn all areas where work has been conducted, 
the people have shown a ready response and an 
almost universal disposition to provide them- 
selves with latrines, but in many cases, lacking 
the practical guidance that might be had from 
a few well-constructed latrines located at con- 
venient centers, have built latrines that are not 
adequate for preventing soil pollution during all 
seasons of the year. The Government is deeply 
interested in this question and has recently 
enacted laws and regulations governing the dis- 
posal of human excrement. It may therefore 
be expected that latrines conforming more nearly 
to the type recommended by the local Advisory 
Committee will soon be installed throughout the 
Island.
-P-A-G-E-134
  134 INTERNATIONAL HEALTH COMMISSION 
ST. LUCIA 
Operations against hookworm disease in St. 
Lucia are in charge of Dr. Stanley Branch, who 
serves under the general direction of an Advisory 
Committee appointed by the Island Govern- 
ment. Dr. Branch began active work on No- 
vember 20, 1914, and up to December 31, 1914, 
conducted a preliminary investigation into the 
distribution and prevalence of the infection. In 
this investigation, 750 persons taken at random 
were examined, and 512, or 68.3 per cent, were 
found to be infected. 
Beginning January I, 1915, work was con- 
ducted along the general lines of the intensive 
method as followed in other West Indian col- 
onies. In the St. Lucia work, however, there 
were two important points of difference: before 
work was begun, no inaugural meeting attended 
by Government officials and prominent citizens 
was held for the purpose of interesting the people 
and gaining their codperation; nor, when treat- 
ment was administered, were the nurses required 
to oversee the actual taking of the medicine in 
every case. 
A staff of two microscopists, three nurses, 
three assistant nurses, and a clerk was engaged 
to assist the director. Headquarters were estab- 
lished in the town of Castries, but the nurses 
and microscopists lived and worked in the areas 
where the work was conducted. 
 
-P-A-G-E-135
  ST. LUCIA 135 
The Cul-de-Sac Valley was selected for pre- 
liminary operations. In this area work was 
conducted from January 1 to June 30, when 
work was begun in another area, located in the 
Castries Valley. Here work was in progress 
until December 31, 1915. 
The Cul-de-Sac Valley is almost entirely rural. 
Dense masses of tropical vegetation grow 
throughout the area, and on the flatter lands 
there is extensive cultivation of cane intermixed 
with crops of cocoa and limes. A large sugar 
company maintains a factory here. Ciceron is 
the only village; elsewhere, the houses are so 
scattered that it has taken hours to visit five or 
six homes on horseback and get back to the 
nearest road. 
The Castries Valley area is naturally divided 
into two portions: one wholly urban, the other 
suburban; with the suburban area further 
divided into ten different localities. The popula- 
tion in the Castries Valley is much more compact 
and therefore easier to handle. More than one- 
half of the people live within the town of Cas- 
tries itself. 
Examination and Treatment 
In the two areas where work was conducted up 
to December 31, 1915, there was a population of 
8,149 persons. Of these, 7,924, or 97.2 per cent, 
were examined; and 4,436, or 56.0 per cent of 
those examined, were found to be infected. First 
treatment was administered to 4,106, or 92.6
-P-A-G-E-136
136 INTERNATIONAL HEALTH COMMISSION 
per cent of the infected persons; and 2,177, or 
53.0 per cent of those given first treatment, 
were shown by microscopic re-examination to 
have been cured. Table 1 exhibits these fig- 
ures in detail for each area.

The results of the work during the second half 
of the year were considerably better than during 
the first, as a comparison of figures for the two 
areas will show. In the area worked during the 
first half of the year, only 37.3 per cent of the 
infected persons were cured (see Table 2, 
page 137), while in that worked during the 
second half, 70.0 per cent were cured. 
Statistics show that of the 1,647 infected 
persons who remained uncured in the first area,
-P-A-G-E-137
  
ST. LUCIA 137 
220 were persons who refused to accept the first 
treatment, while 1,427 were persons who ac- 
cepted the first treatment but did not continue 
treatment until cured. Of the 1,427 who received 
one or more treatments, 1,004, or 70.4 per cent, 
received less than three treatments; while 423, 
or 29.6 per cent, received three or more treat- 
ments. The failure to cure the majority of these 
1,427 persons was not due to direct abandonment 
of treatment by them, but rather to the fact that 
six months did not prove to be a period of time 
sufficiently long to overcome their procrastinat- 
ing habits. Ina large number of cases, re-exami- 
nation, if it could have been made, would doubt- 
less have shown that cures had been effected. 
Table 2 presents a brief summary showing the 
number of infected persons who remained un- 
cured in each area at the close of work:

Table 3 presents figures in detail covering the 
work of examination and treatment, and gives 
the supporting figures upon which Tables 1 and 
2 arebased. (See Table 3, page 139.) 
Educational Work 
The central office at Castries serves as head- 
quarters for educational work. This office is 
open to the public during working hours, and 
people come from all parts of the Island for con- 
sultation. Individual lectures illustrated with 
charts and demonstrations of the ova and living 
embryos under the microscope are given. Lec- 
tures and demonstrations have been held in all 
primary schools in Castries and effort made to 
gain the sympathetic cooperation of managers 
and teachers, so that through them the active 
interest of the school children might be en- 
listed. A lecture was also delivered to the police 
force in Castries. 
Sanitary Improvement 
It has never been the custom in St. Lucia to 
build latrines or even to make any general use of 
commodes. The almost invariable practice of 
the native population is to use earthenware 
utensils of varying kinds and sizes, the contents 
of which are either dumped into a covered pail 
for subsequent disposal or the vessel itself 
covered with an ill-fitting piece of wood and 
put aside until, under cover of darkness, its

-P-A-G-E-140
  140 INTERNATIONAL HEALTH COMMISSION 
contents can be thrown away. It has not been 
found an easy matter to overcome this practice. 
Even in some cases where the people have been 
persuaded to install latrines, these are used 
only as a place into which the vessels may be 
emptied. 
Within the town of Castries water sewerage is 
impracticable; consequently a system of re- 
moval by pails is in use. A sewage barge 
anchors nightly in the river, and all night long 
the inhabitants parade to the barge with their 
receptacles of sewage matter. On the nights of 
November 2-3 and 3-4, 1915, both fine and clear, 
the number of receptacles taken to the barge was 
438 and 560, respectively—an average of 499 per 
night. By the census of 1911 the population of 
Castries was 6,266; the number of inhabited 
houses, 1,329. Assuming that all of the recep- 
tacles were brought from homes within the limits 
of the town, this means one receptacle to every 
two and one-half inhabited houses, or one to 
every twelve and one-half persons, indicating 
that at only 40 per cent of the homes within the 
town limits is effort made to secure a satisfactory 
disposal of the sewage. But there are many 
householders within or near the outskirts of the 
town who claim that they also make use of the 
sewage boat; in the area where work was con- 
ducted, twenty-seven families made this claim. 
If the number of receptacles taken to the boat 
by these out-of-town families should be deducted
-P-A-G-E-141
  ST. LUCIA 141 
from the average of 499, the number of houses 
or persons per receptacle within the town limits 
would be still higher. 
Early in September the Board of Health 
passed a series of regulations to prevent soil 
pollution. Two nurses were temporarily as- 
signed to make a survey of sanitary conditions 
in the rural portion of the area and to endeavor 
to have latrines installed at every home. Be- 
ginning January 1, 1916, these nurses will re- 
turn to their regular duties of treating the 
infected, and a special inspector will be em- 
ployed to devote his whole time to the work of 
sanitary improvement. 
Between September 1 and December 31, 1915, 
each householder was interviewed personally, 
acopy of the regulations was given or read 
to him, and effort was made to persuade him 
to build a latrine. This was the first organ- 
ized attempt ever made in St. Lucia to cope 
with soil pollution. The results have been 
particularly encouraging: the people have 
taken kindly to the idea, no legal prosecutions 
have been necessary, and in certain districts 
new latrines have been erected even before 
the work of examination and treatment was 
under way. 
Table 4 exhibits the results accomplished 
in sanitary work up to December 31, 1915. 
It indicates that among 419 homes in the 
suburban portion of the area, on the first 
 
-P-A-G-E-142
  142 INTERNATIONAL HEALTH COMMISSION 
inspection only 20, or 4.8 per cent, were pro- 
vided with adequate means of sewage disposal, 
as compared with 119, or 28.4 per cent, on the 
last inspection. In addition to this, latrines 
were in process of erection at 62 other homes, 
bringing the number of homes either provided 
or to be provided with latrines to 181, or 43.2

Table 5 presents a summary of the conditions 
found at the 419 homes listed in Table 4. It 
will be seen that among the 399 homes found 
to be without adequate sewage disposal on 
the first inspection, 52 were discharging their 
waste matter into an uncovered cesspool; 65 
into a covered cesspool; 180 were depositing 
it on the surface or into a ravine or gorge; 27 
claimed the use of a sewage boat; and 75 
were throwing their refuse into the sea on the 
fore-shore.

ST. VINCENT 
Early in 1914, Dr. C. H. Durrant, the Colonial 
Surgeon, was appointed to direct measures for 
the relief and control of hookworm disease in 
St. Vincent. ‘The work was not begun immedi- 
ately, however, because the Government could 
find no successor to relieve Dr. Durrant of his 
hospital duties. In February, 1915, the Gov- 
ernor of the Windward Islands asked the Com- 
mission to appoint a director temporarily in lieu 
of Dr. Durrant. Dr. W. P. Jacocks was ac- 
cordingly detailed for the work. He arrived in 
St. Vincent in April, 1915, and began active work 
on May r. 
The intensive method of work was adopted 
and a staff of two microscopists, two nurses, 
two assistant nurses, and one caretaker was 
engaged. 
Up to December 31, 1915, operations had been 
completed in two districts: Calliaqua and Belair. 
Calliaqua, the first district worked, is located 
three miles from Kingstown, the capital. Its 
base extends four miles along the seacoast and 
its legs reach three miles inland, meeting at 
Belmont. 'The boundaries (roads, rivers, and 
the sea) are well defined. Headquarters were 
established in the town of Calliaqua, on the sea- 
coast. The territory embraced in the area con- 
sists of three valleys separated by high and 
steep ridges. Practically all of the land is under
-P-A-G-E-145
ST. VINCENT 145 
cultivation. The people live here and there in 
collections of villages (for example, Choppins 
and Brighton), but with this exception the homes 
are very scattered. During the rainy season, 
from April to December, it was a problem to 
pass from one home to another when these 
homes were not on the main road. Besides, 
many of the people were field laborers who left 
home early and returned late; to interview them 
required visits at unreasonable hours, before 
daybreak or after dark. 
The second area, Belair, adjoins the first. 
This whole district is inland, the nearest sea- 
coast being about two miles away. In the Be- 
lair district the great majority of the inhabitants 
live in seven small villages, with a few homes 
scattered here and there upon the sides of the 
surrounding hills and mountains. 
There is no indentured labor in either district; 
in both, the people were found to be amenable 
to suggestion and anxious to codperate. 
Examination and Treatment 
In both the Calliaqua and Belair areas par- 
ticularly gratifying results were obtained in the 
work of examination and treatment. In the 
Calliaqua area not one person refused to be 
examined—a record for the work to date. In 
the Belair area, only three refused to submit 
specimens. More than this, only eight persons 
in the Calliaqua area refused to continue treat- 
 
-P-A-G-E-146
     
   146 INTERNATIONAL HEALTH COMMISSION 
ment until cured, and in the Belair area only 
twenty-two. 
Out of a total of 3,825 persons living in both 
areas, 3,822, or 99.9 per cent, were microscopi- 
cally examined, and 1,676, or 43.9 per cent of 
those examined, were found to be infected. 
First treatment was administered to 1,590 per- 
sons, 94.9 per cent of those infected; and 1,350 
persons, 84.9 per cent of those receiving first 
treatment, were kept under treatment until 
cured. Figures for each district are shown in 
Table 1.

persons who had not been treated a sufficient 
number of times for a cure to be effected; 30 
refused to be cured; and 75 could not be treated 
for medical reasons. ‘Two persons lived in 
remote places and were unwilling to remain at 
home for treatment except on Sundays, when all 
the nurses were busy in the more populous dis- 
tricts; therefore, they could not be treated. The

Sanitary Improvement | 
The Government of St. Vincent maintains a 
staff engaged in securing the necessary sanitary 
improvement. In the two areas where work was 
 
-P-A-G-E-149
  ST. VINCENT 149 
conducted up to December 31, 1915, there were 
736 homes. On the first inspection only 86, or 
11.7 per cent, were found to be provided with 
latrines. While the work of examination and 
treatment was in progress, 348 new latrines 
were built in these areas, so that on December 
31, 1915, when the work of examination and 
treatment ended, the number of homes provided 
with latrines was 434, or 59.0 per cent of the 
total homes. This does not necessarily mean that 
the remaining 41.0 per cent have no latr’ne 
accommodation. In a great many instances, 
where the families are small, one latrine pro- 
vides accommodation for two or three families. 
Table 4 presents a brief comparison of the 
number of homes with latrines on the first and 
last inspections.

The sanitary work was delayed at the start, 
and did not keep pace with the work of treat- 
ment and cure. It will undoubtedly continue, 
however, until practically every home has been 
provided with satisfactory sanitary conveniences.

The work for the relief and control of hook- 
worm disease in Trinidad is conducted as a 
department of the Government Medical Ser- 
vice under the supervision of the Surgeon 
General. Both the dispensary and intensive 
plans of work have been followed. Col. J. R. 
Dodd, M.D., D.P.H., was appointed Medical 
Officer in Charge June 13, 1914, and served until 
January 19, 1915. From January 20, 1915, 
until November 8, 1915, Dr. C. G. H. Camp- 
bell, M.B., B.A., was Acting Medical Officer in 
Charge, assisted from March 6, 1915, to Novem- 
ber 8, 1915, by Dr. B. E. Washburn, M.A., M.D. 
From November 8, 1915, to December 31, 1915, 
Dr. Washburn has been Medical Officer in Charge. 
Preliminary operations were conducted under 
the dispensary plan, with headquarters at San 
Fernando and branch laboratories at Couva, 
Princes Town, and La Brea. Active work under 
this plan was begun on August I1, 1914, and 
continued until January 1, 1915, when it was 
decided to restrict the field of operations and to 
attempt experimental work under a modification 
of the intensive plan, in the hope that the ex- 
perience gained might make feasible a still closer 
_ approach to the intensive work in the next areas 
to be undertaken. For this experimental inten- 
sive work the Ste. Madeleine area was selected. 
This area was located near San Fernando, and
-P-A-G-E-152
  152 INTERNATIONAL HEALTH COMMISSION 
embraced, besides Ste. Madeleine, the six ad- 
joining villages of Jaipal, Coylas, St. Charles, 
Ne Plus Ultra, Mon Repos, and Cocoye. Work 
in this area continued from January 15 to 
May 15, 1915. Besides the acting medical 
officer in charge and the assistant medical of- 
ficer, the staff consisted of one clerk, three 
nurses, two microscopists, and one caretaker. 
Because the work in this area was not, properly 
speaking, of the intensive type, it is classified 
throughout this report as dispensary work. 
Examination and Treatment: Dispensary Method 
Figures for the dispensary work conducted 
with headquarters at San Fernando, and for the 
modified intensive work later conducted at Ste. 
Madeleine, are presented separately in Table 
1. This shows that a total of 10,204 persons 
were examined, of whom 6,127, or 60.0 per 
cent, were found to be infected. First treat- 
ment was administered to 4,527 persons—73.9 
per cent of those infected—and 526, or 11.6 per 
cent of those receiving first treatment, were 
shown by microscopic re-examination to have 
been cured. (See Table 1, page 153.) 
Examination and Treatment: Intensive Method 
On May 15, 1915, operations under the in- 
tensive plan were begun in the village of Tuna- 
puna and its environs. Tunapuna is a village 
of 6,498 inhabitants, located about nine miles

ter of a densely populated area, about 60 per 
cent of the inhabitants being Creoles and 40 
per cent East Indians. There are no indentured 
laborers. The village and surrounding territory 
were divided into eighteen districts, in thirteen 
of which the work had been completed by De- 
cember 31, 1915. ‘The area is bounded on the 
north by a range of mountains, and on the 
south by a river. It is about two and a half 
miles long, and at no point more than a mile 
1 Since the intensive work was begun in the Tunapuna area and 
the offices at San Fernando and Ste. Madeleine closed, a number of 
incidental examinations have been made and treatments given to 
persons residing outside of the Tunapuna area. These incidental 
examinations and treatments are reported in Table 1 under the head 
of ‘ Miscellaneous,”

in width. Besides Tunapuna, six small villages 
were included. ‘The staff employed in this area 
consisted of the medical officer in charge, three 
clerks, nine nurses, three microscopists, and one 
caretaker. 
In the thirteen districts in which work had 
been completed up to December 31, 1915, there 
were, at the beginning of work, 6,498 inhabitants. 
Of these, 5,943, or 91.5 per cent, were micro- 
scopically examined; and 4,000, or 67.3 per cent, 
were found to be infected. Of the 4,000 persons 
infected, 3,632, or 90.8 per cent, were given first 
treatment; and 2,712, or 74.7 per cent of those 
receiving first treatment, were shown by micro- 
scopic re-examination to have been cured. 
This information is presented in tabular form 
in Table 2.

cent, were cured. It should not be assumed 
from this that the other 1,288 persons, or 32.3 
per cent of those found infected, remained in the 
Tunapuna area uncured at the close of work. Of 
these 1,288 infected persons, 530 removed from 
the area while the work was in progress, leaving 
only 758 uncured persons in the area at the close 
of the work. Two hundred twenty-two of 
these could not be cured for medical reasons, and 
536 refused to be treated.

Sanitary Improvement 
The Government on its part undertakes to 
inaugurate such sanitary changes and improve- 
ments as will reduce to a minimum the dangers 
of re-infection. Laws are in existence for com- 
pelling sanitary improvement where necessary, 
and a sanitary staff working under the direction 
of the warden-is entrusted with the proper en- 
forcement of these laws. 
In the Tunapuna district there are 1,146 
homes. All but 31 of these, or 97.3 per cent, 
now have sanitary latrines, and efforts are being 
made to have latrines erected at the remaining 
31 homes. At the Orphanage and Industrial 
School all the buildings are supplied with 
latrines of the pail type. These are kept in good
-P-A-G-E-158
  
158 INTERNATIONAL HEALTH COMMISSION 
condition and render the inmates safe from in- 
fection. In districts such as 'Tunapuna, where 
the existing infection is reduced to a minimum 
and is followed by adequate sanitary precau- 
tions, the ultimate complete disappearance of 
the disease can be prevented only by its being 
re-introduced from other quarters or by a 
failure properly to maintain the sanitary pre- 
cautions which have been established.
-P-A-G-E-159
COSTA RICA 159 
COSTA RICA 
In‘ the first annual report a brief account is 
given of the opening of work in Costa Rica, 
together with a summary of the results accom- 
plished up to December 31, 1914. On November 
30, 1914, Dr. Louis Schapiro was appointed 
Director of the work in Costa Rica, to succeed 
Dr. Henry R. Carter, Jr. Dr. Schapiro arrived 
in Costa Rica on December 16, 1914, and at once 
assumed active direction of the work. The staff 
consists of an assistant director, a clerk, three 
field directors, and four microscopists, termed 
technical assistants. Headquarters are in the 
city of San Jose. 
Regulations establishing the work as an in- 
tegral part of the Government machinery, under 
the direction of the Minister of Policé, were 
enacted April 8, 1915. Under these regulations 
the work is officially designated as the Depart- 
ment of Ankylostomiasis, and all official doctors, 
governors, chiefs of police, and agents of police 
throughout the Republic are obliged to support 
the work not only in all phases relating to ex- 
amination and treatment, but more especially 
in matters relating to sanitary improvement. 
Householders are required to construct latrines 
satisfactory to the Department of Ankylostomia- 
sis under penalty of fine or imprisonment, and 
in cases where refusals are met the Government 
will construct the privies and charge the expense  
-P-A-G-E-160
  160 INTERNATIONAL HEALTH COMMISSION 
plus a fine to the owner of the house. The 
Government will build privies for persons too 
poor to bear this expense. Members of the 
staff of the Department of Ankylostomiasis are 
clothed with police powers to compel compliance 
with the sanitary regulations. Reports are made 
monthly to the Secretary of Police. 
The dispensary plan is followed, the canton or 
county being the unit of operations. Three 
laboratories operate in the field and one at the 
central office. In each canton, districts con- 
venient to the bulk of the population are selected 
and laboratories established in them. 'To these 
laboratories the people are invited to come for 
free examination and treatment. ‘The police 
authorities are advised in advance when a 
laboratory is to be opened in a new district, and 
are furnished with census books, in which they 
record every house and take a census of each 
inhabitant, including information as to age, sex, 
race, occupation, and the conditions of sewage 
disposal at each home. When the laboratory 
arrives the census is checked by the technical 
assistants, talks are given in the homes, con- 
tainers distributed, and arrangements made for 
a public meeting. On the day following this 
meeting the laboratory is opened. During the 
first months the outlying villages are studied 
and arrangements made for visits to each section 
on different dates by an ambulant laboratory. 
Effort is made to visit each home at least once a
-P-A-G-E-161
COSTA RICA 161 
month, in order that the progress of latrine con- 
struction may be noted and the patients urged to 
return to the laboratory for examination to 
determine whether or not they have been cured. 
Owing to the bad roads into the interior, the 
districts most distant from the central table- 
land are worked during the dry season, and those 
close to the railroads during the wet season. This 
necessary shifting of laboratories has its draw- 
backs, in that at times a dispensary must be 
withdrawn from a district just when the people 
in this and adjoining districts are awakening 
to the positive benefit to be derived from the 
work, 
During the school year every pupil in the 
districts where the laboratories are operating is 
examined and re-examined until the infected have 
been cured. 
Up to December 31, 1914, operations had 
been conducted in two cantons located in the 
extreme northern section of the province of 
Puntarenas, on the Pacific side of the country. 
During 1915, the work was extended to include 
the other six provinces. ‘The names of the 
provinces and cantons in which work has been 
conducted are listed in Table 2, page 164. It 
should not be inferred that the whole area of 
any of these provinces has been covered, nor 
that the work in any of them has been completed,

Examination and Treatment 
In districts where work has been conducted, 
the total population as enumerated by the staff 
of the Department of Ankylostomiasis is 81,515. 
The actual number of persons examined up to 
December 31, 1915, is not known; the figures 
furnished for results of examination have re- 
lated to the number of microscopic examinations 
made and not to the number of persons examined. 
In some cases three, four, or more specimens 
may be examined from one person. In certain 
districts, therefore, the figures for the number of 
examinations exceed the total population. A 
record has been kept of the number of persons 
examined, and as the work in each district is 
closed this information will be obtained from 
the books and embodied in the final reports. 
Up to December 31, 1915, the total number of 
specimens examined was 62,391—57,979 during 
1915 and 4,412 during 1914. Of these specimens, 
38,181, or 61.2 per cent, were found to be posi- 
tive. First treatment was administered to 
26,938 persons, or 33.0 per cent of the total 
population residing in the districts where work 
was conducted. Table 1 gives the total figures 
up to December 31, 1915, showing the results 
of examination and treatment, with figures 
for 1914 and 1915 presented separately.

Educational Work 
An extensive campaign of education has been 
conducted through the public schools, the press, 
and personally by members of the Department 
of Ankylostomiasis, with the assistance of the 
official doctors. Literature has been issued and 
widely distributed: simple sheets for the general 
public, and pamphlets for the school-teachers 
and Government officials. Public meetings are 
held in every district where laboratories are 
established. In all of these districts the official 
doctor has given one or more lecturers on hook-

worm disease to the school-teachers, and in some 
instances to the public. With the hearty co- 
operation of the Minister of Public Instruction 
and the personnel of his department, a compre- 
hensive booklet on hookworm disease was 
issued for the school-teachers, and where neces- 
sary this booklet was explained to the teachers 
by the official doctors. The teachers in turn 
during the last five months of the year gave a 
weekly lesson to their pupils on hookworm 
disease and personal hygiene. Whenever pos- 
sible, special lectures are given to the officials 
of each district, members of the town board and 
school board, and prominent farmers, and talks 
to the people are given in their homes when the 
premises are inspected, and at the laboratories 
whenever ten or more persons form an audience. 
Table 3 indicates that 8,032 lectures have 
been delivered in the work to date, at which the 
total attendance was 102,065 persons.

  Sanitary Improvement 
Recognizing that the success of the work de- 
pends upon the construction and use of sanitary 
latrines, every effort was made to have the pre- 
ventive measures keep pace with those of treat- 
ment and cure. In Costa Rica this phase of the 
work is well fortified with a code of laws com- 
pelling the householders to effect such sanitary 
improvements as may be required by the De- 
partment of Ankylostomiasis. Even under the 
most favorable conditions, however, it is a slow 
and difficult task to change the confirmed habits 
of thousands of people and to bring them to a 
point where latrines will be built and used. 
Immediately upon opening work in each dis- 
trict the assistants make an inspection of the 
latrine conditions at each home. A total of 
 
-P-A-G-E-167
  COSTA RICA 167 
8,261 homes have been inspected in the work 
to date. On the first inspection only 867, or 
10.5 per cent of these homes, were found to be 
provided with latrines. During the progress of 
the work, usually at intervals of one month, 
subsequent inspections are carried out and im- 
provement in sanitation noted. On the last in- 
spection of the premises of these 8,261 homes, 
it was found that 2,123, or 25.7 per cent, had 
latrines—making an increase in the number of 
homes with latrines of 1,256, or 15.2 per cent.

accomplished in sanitary improvement up to

  168 INTERNATIONAL HEALTH COMMISSION 
GUATEMALA 
In November, 1914, the Republic of Guate- 
mala invited the International Health Commis- 
sion to cooperate with it in measures for the 
relief and control of hookworm disease. The 
invitation was extended in a conference between 
the President of the country, His Excellency 
Sr. Lic. Manuel Estrada Cabrera, and Dr. J. H. 
White, who represented the Commission in the 
preliminary arrangements for work in Central 
America. On November 30, 1914, the invita- 
tion was formally accepted by the Commission. 
On that date Dr. W. H. Rowan was appointed 
Director. Dr. Rowan arrived in Guatemala on 
January 26, 1915, and following a series of con- 
ferences with Government officials, plantation 
owners, and influential citizens, began active 
work on March 15. Headquarters were estab- 
lished at Guatemala City and a staff of one field 
director, four microscopists, and one clerk was 
employed to assist the director. 
The work in Guatemala is conducted as a 
branch of the National Board of Health, known 
as the Department of Uncinariasis. Dr. Rowan 
was appointed Director of this department, and 
three members of the National Board of Health 
were named a committee for directing its affairs. 
From the outset the National Board of Health 
has codperated most energetically in the work. 
Operations have been conducted on a plan
-P-A-G-E-169
GUATEMALA 169 
almost identical in its main features with the 
intensive method followed in the West Indies. 
House-to-house distribution and collection of 
specimen containers is carried out; treatment 
is administered in the homes of the patients; 
and simultaneously with the work of examina- 
tion and treatment, measures for preventing re- 
infection are introduced. The main point of 
difference, however, is that microscopic re-exam- 
inations for determining cure are not a feature 
of the work, so that no definite figures are avail- 
able for the number of persons remaining in 
each district uncured at the close of the work. 
For this reason the Guatemala work is classified 
throughout this report as being of the dispen- 
sary type. 
The coffee plantation, or finca, is the unit of 
work. On the first day on an estate a dispen- 
sary is established. ‘This serves as headquarters 
for examining specimens, keeping records, and 
preparing treatments. At night there is a pub- 
lic illustrated lecture. On the second day house- 
to-house visits are made and containers dis- 
tributed. The work continues until all of the 
inhabitants have had an opportunity to be ex- 
amined and treated. It has been found possible 
to complete work on estates of average size in 
about two weeks or eighteen days. 
Up to December 31, 1915, work had been 
completed on eighty-seven coffee estates. All 
except eleven were located in what is known as 
 
-P-A-G-E-170
  170 INTERNATIONAL HEALTH COMMISSION 
the Costa Cuba coffee district, lying between 
the rivers Naranjo and Tilapa, in the departments 
of Quezaltenango, Retalhulen, and San Marcos. 
This district is situated on the Pacific side of 
the country near the northern boundary with 
Mexico, and is located at an average altitude of 
2,400 feet. The eleven estates not included in 
this district are located: one in the department 
of Santa Rosa, one in Chinaltenango, and nine 
in Suchitepequez. Almost the whole extent of 
the Costa Cuba district in which work has been 
conducted lies within the department of Quez- 
altenango, extending for short distances into the 
department of Retalhulen on the south and San 
Marcos on the north. 
Some work was also undertaken in the town 
of Coatepeque in the department of Quezal- 
tenango; the patients at the General Hospital 
of Guatemala were examined and treated; and 
a few examinations were made and treatments 
given at the central office. 
Examination and Treatment 
‘The work conducted up to December 31, 1915, 
embraced a population of 28,090 persons. Of 
these, 25,587, or 91.1 per cent, were microscopi- 
cally examined, and 15,001, or 58.6 per cent of 
those examined, were found infected. First 
treatment was administered to 13,783 persons 
—9I.9 per cent of those found infected. This 
is shown in Table 1.

Considering separately the results accom- 
plished on the coffee estates, to which the work 
may be said to have been practically ‘confined, 
it will be seen that the work embraced a popu- 
lation of 25,544 persons, of whom 24,163, or 94.6 
per cent, were microscopically examined. Of 
those examined, 14,482, or 59.9 per cent, were 
found infected, and 13,419, or 92.7 per cent of 
those infected, received first treatment. 
Educational Work 
Almost all of the inhabitants of the coffee 
estates are Indians. In some cases four or five 
tribes may be employed on one estate, each with 
its own dialect and customs. Members of one 
tribe frequently are incapable of conversing with 
the members of any of the other tribes. The 
absolute illiteracy of these people has made it 
necessary to depend upon individual instruction 
and to teach them so far as possible by means 
of pictures. 
On the first evening following the opening of 
work on an estate a public lecture illustrated by 
stereopticon views is given. This lecture is 
always well attended and full of interest for the 
Indians, who have never before seen a stereopti- 
con. The next day the assistant takes his chart 
and specimens and goes from house to house 
explaining the nature of the disease and the 
method of curing and preventing it. At the dis- 
pensaries demonstrations under the microscope
-P-A-G-E-173

also are given. ‘Table 2 indicates that 5,990 lec- 
tures, including house-to-house talks, have been 
given, at which the attendance was 46,300 per- 
sons. Eighteen were school lectures delivered to 
an audience of 300 persons, and 449 were pub- 
lic lectures attended by approximately 22,000 
persons.

During the year the first public health bulletin 
ever issued in Guatemala was published jointly 
_ by the National Board of Health and the Depart- 
ment of Uncinariasis. In addition, three hundred 
large, one-page charts on hookworm disease, to 
be placed in schools throughout the Republic, 
have been completed, and a traveling exhibit 
has been prepared to teach the people in detail 
the story of the disease. 
Sanitary Improvement 
Due attention has been given to sanitary 
improvement. ‘The necessity for this will be 
clear when it is stated that in work lasting over a 
period of almost an entire year, embracing 
eighty-seven estates and a population of 25,544 
persons, only four latrines used by laborers and 
their families have been found. It might almost 
be said that in its small towns and rural districts 
Guatemala is a country without latrines. Be- 
sides, the conditions are particularly favorable 
for the spread of hookworm infection, On the 
coffee estates the coffee trees must be protected 
by a growth of larger shade trees; as a result the 
plantation becomes a forest jungle in which the 
ground is well shaded and is kept moist under a 
covering of mulch. The laborers live in small, 
detached houses scattered in rows over the 
estates. In the absence of latrine accommoda- 
tions the soil about them becomes contaminated 
with hookworm eggs, and the whole laboring
-P-A-G-E-175
  GUATEMALA 195 
population goes barefoot during the entire 
year. : 
Owners and officials of the estates upon which 
work is conducted appreciate the situation and 
are anxious to codperate by having suitable 
latrines erected. One administrator to whom a 
plan was presented of a cheap but adequate 
latrine gave as his reason for rejecting it that he 
wished to erect forty of the best latrines in the 
country. This attitude is typical of the estate 
owners as a whole. 
The latrines being erected in Guatemala are 
commonly placed at the end of a row of laborers’ 
houses and are large enough to accommodate all 
of the persons living in that row. An average of 
about twelve persons is accommodated by each 
latrine. During the progress of the work 1,048 
new latrines have been constructed under the 
supervision of the Department of Uncinariasis, 
to provide latrine accommodations for 12,576 
persons, or approximately one-half of the total 
population of the estates. These figures rep- 
resent only the actual number of new latrines 
erected while the work of examination and treat- 
ment was.in progress on each estate. A great 
many more latrines are erected after the dis- 
pensary work has been completed, but figures for 
these arenotavailable. . 
All latrine building is done at the expense of 
the estate owner. No work is conducted on the 
estate until the owners have agreed to carry out
-P-A-G-E-176

the necessary measures of sanitary improvement.

Formal invitation to the International Health 
Commission to participate in measures for the 
relief and control of hookworm disease was ex- 
tended by the Republic of Nicaragua through its 
Legation at Washington on October 6, 1914. 
This invitation was accepted by the Commission 
on November 30, 1914, and on December 11, 
1914, Dr. D. M. Molloy was appointed to have 
immediate charge of the work. Dr. Molloy 
assisted in organizing and conducting the work 
in Guatemala for some months, arriving in 
Nicaragua near the end of May, 1915. Head- 
quarters were established at Managua. While 
awaiting receipt of equipment from the States, 
conferences were held with Government officials, 
physicians, and influential citizens, and atten- 
tion was given to routine matters connected with 
the inauguration of work. 'To these preliminary 
activities the first four months were devoted. 
By presidential decree issued in September, 
1915, the work is conducted as a department of 
the National Board of Health, its official desig- 
nation being the Department of Uncinariasis. 
In this way the work assumes official character, 
and is identified as a Nicaraguan effort, done by 
the Nicaraguan people under the patronage 
and with the support of their Government. 
All the work of examination and treatment 
has been conducted on the dispensary plan. On
-P-A-G-E-178
178 INTERNATIONAL HEALTH COMMISSION 
the San Antonio sugar plantation effort was made 
to accompany this work by the necessary sani- 
tary rem, approaching in this respect more 
nearly the intensive plan of work. The staff 
has consisted of the director in charge, one 
clerk, one field director, termed medical assist- 
ant, and four microscopists, termed technical 
assistants. Wherever possible, house-to-house 
work has been attempted in securing specimens 
and administering treatment. 
To date the work has been practically con- 
fined to the department of Chinandega, although 
some preliminary survey work was done during 
November and December, 1915, in the depart- 
ment of Managua. 
Active work was begun on October 1, 1915, 
on the San Antonio plantation, the largest sugar 
plantation in Central America. This estate, em- 
each fifteen colonies, lies about four miles 
from the town of Chichigalpa in the department 
of Chinandega. Work was continued on this 
estate until November 1, when operations 
were begun in Corinto, a typical Nicaraguan 
town, located on the Pacific coast in the same 
depattment. Here work continued until De- 
cember 1, when a permanent laboratory dis- 
trict for the department of Chinandega with 
headquarters in the town of Chinandega was 
established. 
st of the work in Nicaragua has been done 
in the more populous sections, where no racial 
 
-P-A-G-E-179
  NICARAGUA 179 
distinctions are attempted. Comparatively few 
people of foreign extraction have been examined, 
and no work has yet been done among the indig- 
enous tribes. The majority of the persons ex- 
amined belong to the mixed class. 
Examination and Treatment 
Up to December 31, 1915, 5,429 persons had 
been microscopically examined for hookworm 
disease, of whom 2,681, or 49.4 per cent, were 
found infected. First treatment was adminis- 
tered to 1,611, or 60.1 per cent of those infected. 
Table 1 gives figures by districts showing the 
results of examination and treatment.

Educational Work 
Educational work has been carried on in all dis- 
tricts where laboratories have been in operation. 
On beginning the work in each district, public lec- 
tures illustrated by lantern slides and charts have 
been delivered. Local officials, plantation own- 
ers, priests, teachers, and leading citizens have 
also been interviewed and their support enlisted. 
About 1,500 pamphlets, treating of the disease 
in general, and a great many posters announcing 
the opening of the work, have been distributed. 
“ Sanitary Improvement 
There are no definite regulations covering the 
construction and use of sanitary latrines. Efforts 
at sanitary reform have therefore centered in 
advice given to the people at the lectures and at 
the dispensaries to build latrines for their own 
protection. On the San Antonio sugar estate dur- 
ing November about twenty pit latrines were in- 
stalled. This measures the practical results so 
far accomplished. ‘The President, however, has 
manifested his desire to codperate by instructing 
the governors of departments and local officials 
to issue regulations compelling the construction 
and proper maintenance of latrines. Dr. Molloy 
has been asked to aid in framing a bill to be sub- 
mitted to Congress in which sanitary regulations 
adequate for the present requirements of the coun- 
try may be formulated. It is therefore hoped 
that an effective campaign may be inaugurated
-P-A-G-E-181
  NICARAGUA 181 
during the coming year. To this end the Min- 
ister of Public Instruction has promised to 
codperate through the schools by having the 
children properly instructed in sanitary require- 
ments at their homes, and by setting them an 
object lesson in sanitation at the schools. 
The sanitary survey of 469 homes in the town 
of Corinto, exhibited in Table 2, may be 
taken as typical of conditions in the average 
town of Nicaragua. It will be seen that only 
185, or 49.1 per cent of the homes, had latrines 
of any kind, and that 142 of these, or 76.8 per 
cent, were provided with latrines of the open- 
back type entirely inadequate for preventing 
pollution of the soil. It may therefore be said 
that only 43, or 23.4 per cent of the homes, were 
provided with conditions of sewage disposal ade- 
quate for preventing hookworm disease.

  182 INTERNATIONAL HEALTH COMMISSION 
PANAMA 
The first annual report spoke of the inaugura- 
tion of work in Panama, described briefly the 
methods followed in the preliminary operations, 
and gave an account of the results up to De- 
cember 31, 1914. The work received the formal 
sanction and authority of the Government when, 
on September 2, 1915, an executive decree was 
signed by the President incorporating it as a 
part of the Department of Public Works with 
the title of Department of Uncinariasis. Dur- 
ing 1915 the work continued under the direction 
of Dr. L. W. Hackett. 
Operations in Panama follow the dispensary 
plan, but whenever practicable treatments are 
followed up and re-examinations made for de- 
termining cure. In this country the sparse- 
ness of the population, the difficulties of travel 
and communication, and the absence of large 
towns or estates giving employment to hundreds 
of people seem to make the dispensary method 
a better way of bringing relief to the sufferers. 
The staff engaged in the work, in addition to 
the Director and his clerk, consists of four field 
directors, termed technical assistants, and eight 
microscopists. Four laboratories are in opera- 
tion, three in the field and one at the central 
‘office. The three field laboratories succeed in 
examining about 95 per cent of the accessible 
population in each district. Approximately
-P-A-G-E-183
PANAMA 183 
one-half of the persons found infected receive 
at least two treatments, which, as shown 
elsewhere in this report, are adequate for cur- 
ing the disease in about 50 per cent of the 
cases. 
Up to December 31, 1915, work had been con- 
ducted in fifteen districts in seven provinces of 
Panama. The districts in which work has been 
undertaken contain 30 per cent of the total area 
of the country and 35 per cent of the total popu- 
lation. It should be understood, however, that 
in many of these districts work had not been 
completed by December 31, 1915; only in the 
province of Bocas del Toro, embracing the dis- 
tricts of Almirante, Bastimentos, Bocas del Toro, 
and Chiriqui Grande, may the work be said to 
have been completed. In all of the districts, 
and especially on the Pacific side of the country, 
great stretches of uninhabited hill and forest 
intervene and there is considerable territory in- 
habited by scattered Indian tribes, so that every 
square mile is not covered. 
Examination and Treatment 
A total of 30,331 persons have been micro- 
scopically examined—5,321 during 1914, and 
25,010 during 1915. Of these, 19,797, or 65.3 
per cent, were found infected, and 17,480, or 
88.3 per cent of those found infected, were 
given first treatment.

Both in percentage and degree of infection, 
the native population along the Atlantic Ocean 
and in the foothills of the mountains on the 
Pacific side, where the dry season is not well 
defined and the people are engaged mainly in 
agriculture, has been found to suffer most. 
The percentage of infection ranges from 85 to 
95 per cent, and the hemoglobin index is below 
60. The people of the plains on the Pacific side, 
where there is no moisture for three months in 
the year, have in comparison with this a per-

Educational Work 
In each district where laboratories are located, 
the staff lectures on the cause and the effect of 
the disease, and the methods of relieving and 
controlling it. Instruction is given by addresses 
delivered to schools, to the general public, and 
by house-to-house or individual talks. Table 3 
shows that up to December 31, 1915, 5,193 lec- 
tures were delivered, attended by 22,635 persons. 
Forty-nine were school lectures and 117 public.

Sanitary Improvement 
Elementary sanitation is one of the greatest 
needs of Panama. In some loosely built towns 
of approximately 4,000 inhabitants there are few 
latrines of any description. Where latrines exist 
they are of such a character as to be a menace - 
rather than a protection. It seems probable 
that these conditions will be improved during the 
coming year by the enactment of a law requiring 
that all houses shall be provided with latrines, 
which shall be regularly inspected. Up to this 
time efforts at sanitary reform have had to rely 
wholly upon education and persuasion, which, un- 
backed by legislation, have been found to accom- 
plish very little. One important advance, how- 
ever, has been made by the Department of Public 
Instruction in equipping schoolhouses in the in- 
terior with latrines. It is estimated that about 
one-half of the schools now have latrines which 
were built during the year 1915.. The work of 
constructing these latrines will be continued until 
everyschoolhousein thecountry hasbeen provided.

  188 INTERNATIONAL HEALTH COMMISSION 
EGYPT 
Measures against hookworm disease in Egypt 
are under the direct supervision of Dr. A. Mac- 
Callan, of the Government Department of Pub- 
lic Health. The work has been conducted in 
accordance with a plan formulated by the local 
uncinariasis committee. It has two main fea- 
tures: (1) hospital work; and (2) survey work. 
Conditions in Egypt seem to make it necessary 
to administer treatment to infected persons 
under hospital conditions. For this purpose 
traveling tent hospitals, each capable of accom- 
modating 100 patients, are established at con- 
venient points, to which the people come for 
free examination and treatment. Infected per- 
sons are housed and fed at the hospital until the 
full course of treatment has been completed. 
Many of them come for hundreds of miles to 
receive the benefit of treatment, some floating 
down the Nile on rafts from remote sections of 
Upper Egypt. Among 10,860 persons treated 
up to March 31, 1915, 3,067, or 28.2 per cent, 
came from provinces other than those in which 
the hospitals were established. At each of these 
traveling hospitals a laboratory is provided for 
the microscopic examination of feces, urine, and 
blood; and a small separate enclosure is reserved 
for women patients. Each has its own staff, 
consisting usually of two doctors, a clerk, two’ 
male and one female attendants, a cook, a gate-
-P-A-G-E-189
  EGYPT 189 
keeper, a water-carrier, a watchman, and a mes- 
senger-boy. 
The scheme provides also for a systematic 
survey to determine the prevalence of hook- 
worm disease, as well as to establish the danger 
points about the villages from which the infec- 
tion is spread. In the survey work clinical 
examinations are also made incidentally for esti- 
mating the degree of prevalence of two other 
endemic scourges: bilharziasis and pellagra. 
Hospital Work 
The original scheme of operations provided 
that hospital work should be undertaken prov- 
ince by province until the whole of the infected 
area had been covered. On this basis it was 
proposed to establish from four to six traveling 
hospitals at convenient points, and to move 
these hospitals from point to point as the appli- 
cations for admission diminished. The outbreak 
of the European war, by curtailing the revenue 
of the Egyptian Government, resulted in the 
enforced reduction of the number of traveling 
hospitals to two. 
Initial operations were begun in Qaliubia 
province on December 13, 1913, when a travel- 
ing hospital was opened at Qaliub. Subse- 
quently, on March 1, 1914, a second hospital 
was established at Qalama. Both of these hos- 
pitals remained in operation until August 10, 
1914, when they were removed and established 
   
-P-A-G-E-190
190 INTERNATIONAL HEALTH COMMISSION 
on September 5, 1914, at Belbeis and Minia el 
Qamh in Sharqia province. These two hospitals 
continued in operation until April 8, 1915, when 
operations against hookworm disease had to be 
temporarily abandoned and the hospitals moved 
to Alexandria to provide emergency accommo- 
dations for wounded soldiers. During all of this 
period the permanent hospital on the estate of 
Ibraham Pasha Murad at El Deir was also used 
for the accommodation and treatment of per- 
sons suffering from hookworm disease. 
The number of persons microscopically exam- 
ined for hookworm disease in the hospital work 
conducted from December 13, 1913, to April 8, 
1915, when work had to be temporarily aban- 
doned, was 20,865. Of these, 12,450, or 59.7 
per cent, were found to be infected. Of those 
infected, 11,280, or 90.6 per cent, were admitted 
to the hospitals; and 10,694, or 94.8 per cent of 
those admitted, completed the full treatment. 
These figures are exhibited in Table 1. 
TABLE 1: LEgypt—Hospital Work: Number of Per- 
sons Examined, Found Infected, Admitted to Hos-

Patients who completed the full treatment 
were encouraged to return to the hospital for re- 
examination one month or more after being dis- 
charged, and were promised a bottle of iron 
medicine as an incentive. In each case the feces 
were centrifuged and two slides carefully exam- 
ined before the specimen was pronounced nega- 
tive. Statistics show that up to April 8, 1915, 
the number of persons who were thus re-exam- 
ined following treatment was 1,859, or 17.4 per 
cent of those who received full treatment, and 
it was found that 1,622, or 87.3 per cent of the 
persons re-examined, had been cured. Table 
2 exhibits this information in tabular form.

Survey Work 
Simultaneously with the hospital work, sur- 
veys have been conducted in the province of 
Shargia in Lower Egypt and Assiut in Upper 
Egypt for determining the degree of infection 
and for locating the danger points from which 
 
-P-A-G-E-192
  192 INTERNATIONAL HEALTH COMMISSION 
the infection is spread. Clinical examinations 
have also been made for pellagra and bilharziasis. 
The survey in Shargia province was conducted 
during the months of October, November, and 
December, 1914, and its results were reported 
in detail in the first annual report. The survey 
in Assiut was in progress from January to April, 
1915. During April the survey work terminated 
along with the hospital work, when all facilities 
for the care of sick and wounded soldiers were 
requisitioned for use at Alexandria. 
In both provinces the survey was confined to 
“men and boys, owing to the difficulty of exam- 
ining women in Oriental countries; there is, 
however, no doubt that women are largely in- 
fected. In Sharqia province, among 6,082 males 
examined, representing approximately 0.7 per 
cent of the total population, 3,412, or 56.1 per 
cent, were found infected. In Assiut, 4,411 
males were examined—o.5 per cent of the total 
population—and 2,018, or 45.7 per cent, were 
found infected. This information in detail is 
shown in Table 3. (See Table 3, page 193.) 
The prevalence of hookworm disease in Shar- 
qia, a typical province of Lower Egypt, to the 
extent of 56 per cent, and in Assiut, a typical 
province of Upper Egypt, to the extent of 45 per 
cent, seems to justify the conclusion that the 
disease is wide-spread throughout Egypt. 
In the province of Assiut the infection among 
men, all of whom resided in the seven largest

  towns of the province, was found to be 27.5 per 
cent, as compared with an infection of 22.7 
per cent among the boys examined in these 
same towns. The difference between boys and 
men is thus seen to be small, so that the survey 
of rural districts, which was based entirely upon 
the examination of boys, may be taken as a 
fairly accurate measure of the infection among 
adults. 
A very considerable difference was found to 
exist between the infection in the large towns 
and in the country villages. In the large towns 
the percentage of boys infected was 22.7 per 
cent, while in the villages it was 51.1 per cent. 
In the capital town of the province, Assiut, only 
4.4. per cent of the boys were infected. 
A cursory examination for pellagra was con- 
ducted among the 4,411 persons examined for 
hookworm disease, and it was found that 89, or 
2.0 per cent, were infected with this disease. It
-P-A-G-E-194
194 INTERNATIONAL HEALTH COMMISSION 
should be pointed out, however, that the survey 
was conducted during the winter months, when 
pellagra is not common, and also that the dis- 
ease was not diagnosed unless very obvious. 
For the purpose of estimating the prevalence 
of bilharziasis, each of these 4,411 persons was 
also questioned as to whether or not he had ever 
noticed blood in his urine. Those stating that 
they had done so numbered 443 persons—1o.0 
per cent of the total. These were classed as 
infected with bilharziasis. This is probably 
quite a legitimate conclusion; but the converse, 
that those who had not noticed blood in their 
urine were not infected, is far from being correct. 
Hemoglobin tests were made of the blood of 
505 boys, 138 of whom were infected with hook- 
worm disease and 367 were not. The hemo- 
globin index of the non-infected boys was 75.5, 
as compared with the index of 69.6 among the 
infected. 
In every town or village a note was made as to 
the presence or absence of pools of stagnant 
water, termed birkets. These birkets contain 
infiltration water which at certain seasons of the 
year may dry up. To them are attributed much 
of the high incidence of disease and consequent 
mortality, especially among children. In the 
case of hookworm disease, however, it was found 
that those villages with birkets did not show a 
markedly heavier infection than the villages 
without them.

ACTIVITIES 
I 
HEMOGLOBIN TESTS 
1. Among General Population.—In three 
countries—Costa Rica, Panama, and Egypt— 
hemoglobin tests were made of a large pro- 
portion of the persons who were examined for 
uncinariasis. ‘The blood of 41,380 persons was 
tested and it was found that the average 
hemoglobin index of these persons was 59. In 
Panama and Costa Rica the index was 63 and 
64 respectively, while in Egypt it dropped to 44. 
These statistics are exhibited in Table 1 :

  2. Comparison of Infected and Non-In- 
fected Cases.—Uncinariasis is not the only 
factor contributing to this anemia. In all of 
these countries insufficient nourishment and the 
presence of other diseases play their part in 195  
-P-A-G-E-196
196 INTERNATIONAL HEALTH COMMISSION 
reducing the vitality of the inhabitants. But 
that uncinariasis is responsible for much of this 
anemia is shown by tests made in Costa Rica, 
Grenada, and Egypt, the results of which are 
presented in Tables 2, 3, and 4. 
In Costa Rica (see Table 2) hemoglobin tests 
made of the blood of 7,355 infected persons taken 
at random gave an index of 66, as compared with 
an index of 71 among 4,860 persons taken at 
random who were not infected. Further tests 
were made of the blood of 1,150 persons who had 
been cured of uncinariasis and it was found that 
the hemoglobin index of these persons im- 
mediately following treatment had risen to 75, 
showing that as a result of treatment and cure 
for uncinariasis the hemoglobin index rose to a 
point four degrees higher than the index of 
persons who were not originally infected.

of these persons a month or more after they had

were submitted for examination, and include 
persons infected and not infected. The table 
indicates that for these two countries the hemo-

together and for each race taken separately, 
bears a remarkable similarity. For Costa Rica

the index for all races combined is shown to be 
64, as compared with 63 for Panama. The In- 
dian race in Panama presents the lowest index, 
with 58; and the black race in Costa Rica the 
highest, with 71. (See Table 5, page 198.) 
Il 
TREATMENT FOR PARASITIC DISEASES OTHER 
THAN UNCINARIASIS 
In all countries where uncinariasis exists the 
disease is complicated by the presence of other 
intestinal parasitic diseases, including infection 
with round worms (Ascaris), whip worms 
(Trichocephalus), pin worms (Oxyuris), tape 
worms (Tenia), and various other species of 
parasitic worms. For instance, among 291,855 
persons examined for uncinariasis in the South- 
ern United States, British West Indies, Central 
America, and Egypt, 98,454 were found to be 
infected with Ascaris, 68,590 with Trichocepha- 
lus, 3,921 with Strongyloides, 2,764 with Tzenia, 
and 4,743 with Oxyuris. Often two, three, or 
more of these parasites exist in the same per- 
son; in Costa Rica more than ninety per cent 
of the population so far examined have been 
found to harbor one or more species of intestinal 
parasites. No thorough examination for para- 
sites other than Uncinaria is carried out; the 
eggs of the other worms are always revealed 
incidentally in the search for Uncinaria, and no
-P-A-G-E-200
  200 INTERNATIONAL HEALTH COMMISSION 
further examination of the specimen is made 
after the ova of Uncinaria have been discovered. 
In most of the countries no attempt has been 
made to administer treatment for other para- 
sites, the work of relief being confined to meas- 
ures against uncinariasis alone. In a few, how- 
ever, as in Trinidad, Costa Rica, Guatemala, 
Nicaragua, and Panama, it has been found that 
treatment for other parasites often lends strong 
psychic support to the measures against uncina- 
riasis. This is notably true in the case of As- 
caris. These are large worms plainly visible to 
the naked eye, and when expelled by the patient 
after treatment they enable him to understand

better the part that the smaller worms, such as 
Uncinaria, may play in undermining his health. 
Table 6 shows that 20,744 treatments were 
administered for other diseases in the five coun- 
tries above named. In Guatemala and Costa 
Rica the number of treatments administered for 
each of the parasites is not given, but in both 
countries most of the treatments were for 
Ascaris. In Costa Rica, however, a large num- 
ber of school-children in the cities of San José 
and Heredia were treated for Tzenia, and in 
Panama forty-five persons received treatment 
for malaria in addition to the regular work 
against uncinariasis. (See Table 6, page 200.)

IV. TECHNIQUE OF EXAMINATION AND 
TREATMENT 
I 
MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION 
In Trinidad and British Guiana during 1915 
experiments were conducted for determining the 
importance of the centrifuge as an aid in correct 
diagnosis. "These experiments show a striking 
similarity in results and go far toward establish- 
ing a correct technique of microscopic examina- 
tion. By a method combining the examination 
of a number of ordinary smeared slides with the 
examination of a number of smeared slides after 
the specimen had been centrifuged, an improve- 
ment was obtained of approximately 11 per — 
cent over the results by the ordinary smeared- 
slide process. ‘This is exhibited in Table 1. 
(See Table 1, page 203.) 
In Trinidad the test led to the adoption of 
the examination of two smeared slides before 
centrifuging and two smeared slides after 
centrifuging as the routine method of diagnosis. 
In examining the 1,434 specimens referred tc 
in Table 1, a record was kept of the results 
obtained on each slide. These results are 
exhibited in Table 2. (See Table 2, page 
204.)

From the fact that no ova were discovered on 
the third slide examined after centrifuging, Dr. 
Washburn concluded that an examination of 
two slides after the specimen had been centri- 
fuged was sufficient for accurate diagnosis. 
In British Guiana the results obtained on each 
slide have not been reported, but for the first 
examination of each person Dr. Field has been 
led to adopt the routine of examining from five 
to eight smeared slides before centrifuging, and 
five smeared slides after centrifuging. For re- 
examination after treatment this process is 
reversed and from five to eight centrifuged 
smeared slides are examined first. Whether the 
results obtained are sufficient to justify the
-P-A-G-E-205
TECHNIQUE OF EXAMINATION 205 
examination of so many slides from each speci- 
men can be determined only on the basis of 
further investigation: in both countries, however, 
the routine of examination would seem to be 
thorough enough for locating practically all of 
the infected cases. 
In Trinidad the following rules have been 
adopted for the examination of specimens: 
1. Each microscopist must examine in every 
detail and one at a time the specimens which are 
assigned to him. He will make a smear of the 
specimen on a glass slide with a wooden toothpick 
for examination with the microscope, using a 
different toothpick for each specimen and for each 
smear. The microscopist must make his own 
smears, prepare his own negative specimens for the 
centrifuge, and make out his own reports. 
z. Two large smears will be made from each 
specimen and carefully examined in the ordinary 
way. If the specimen is found to be negative on 
being examined in this way, it will be put aside and 
centrifuged. 
3. When a microscopist has accumulated twenty 
negative specimens he will prepare them for the 
centrifuge as follows: 
(a) Containers will be placed on a chart having 
small squares numbered from one to twenty, and 
will be taken up one by one, beginning at number 
one. 
(2) A sufficient portion of the specimen will be 
placed in a small glass jar to which water has been 
added, and an emulsion made by stirring with a 
toothpick. 
(c) The emulsion will then be poured through a 
funnel into a centrifuge tube, one end of which has 
been previously corked. 
(d) A cork will then be placed in the other end 
of the tube, and the tube placed in the pan of the 
centrifuge at the number corresponding to the 
 
-P-A-G-E-206
206 INTERNATIONAL HEALTH COMMISSION 
number on the chart from which the specimen was 
taken. 
(e) After twenty specimens have been prepared 
and centrifuged, smears will be made from the out- 
ward end of each tube and examined. Two smears 
must be examined before the specimen is pro- 
nounced negative. 
The microscopic department is equipped with 
microscopes having mechanical stages, centrifuge 
glassware, microscopic slides (size 1 x 3 inches 
preferred), toothpicks, and paper bags. Me- 
chanical stages for the microscopes have been 
found to be almost indispensable for thorough 
and efficient work. The centrifuge used in the 
work is a specially constructed machine placed 
upon the market by the Bausch & Lomb 
Optical Company. It is a hand-driven machine 
equipped with a Stewart pan-head carrying 
twenty tubes. 
After the specimens have been examined, the 
discarded tins and dirty toothpicks are thrown 
into paper bags. These bags are emptied each 
day into a large barrel filled with water into 
which crude carbolic acid has been placed as a 
- deodorant. Kerosene oil is placed on top of the 
water to keep mosquitoes away. When the 
barrel becomes filled, it is carted off to the public 
dumping ground and the contents buried. The 
dirty glassware—microscopic slides, centrifuge 
tubes, and funnels—is placed into a pan contain- 
ing a solution of formalin. After each day’s 
work this solution is poured off and the glassware 
 
-P-A-G-E-207
  TECHNIQUE OF EXAMINATION 207 
is washed in clean water and then boiled.. After 
being boiled it is left over night in a solution of 
methylated spirits (denatured alcohol) and the 
next morning dried with a clean towel. 
In British Guiana a series of experiments was 
carried out for determining whether or not the 
thorough examination of one specimen following 
treatment is sufficient for demonstrating cure, 
and if so, at what interval of time following the 
last treatment this specimen should be secured. 
Some authorities have held that two treatments 
are incapable of producing a cure in all but a 
few mild cases, despite the fact that the records 
in many of the countries indicate that cures are 
produced by two treatments in approximately 
fifty per cent of the cases. Others have held 
that the re-examination of one specimen is in- 
sufficient for determining whether any given case 
is positive or negative; that re-examination at 
the end of one week, or less than one week, fol- 
lowing the administration of thymol does not 
allow sufficient time for the ova to reach the 
rectum; and that the administration of thymol 
interferes with the procreative functions of the 
Uncinaria remaining in the intestine, so that 
more than one week must be allowed for these 
functions to be completely restored. These 
considerations led Dr. Field to re-examine at an 
interval of one month after treatment, 117 cases 
which had received only two treatments and 
which had been pronounced cured following 
 
-P-A-G-E-208
208 INTERNATIONAL HEALTH COMMISSION 
microscopic examination of one specimen. In 
originally pronouncing these cases cured, the 
regular technique of re-examination in British 
Guiana was followed, consisting of the examina- 
tion of from five to eight smeared slides from a 
centrifuged emulsion, followed by the examina- 
tion of five more smeared slides from the original 
specimen without centrifuging. 
Ninety-nine of the 117 cases re-examined one 
month after being pronounced cured were cases 
which had not originally been re-examined and 
pronounced cured until a lapse of at least seven 
days following treatment. These cases ran from 
a minimum of seven days to a maximum of forty- 
eight days (mean, eleven days) following treat- 
ment before the specimen was re-examined upon 
which the cure was pronounced. Among these 
99 cases re-examined one month after they had 
been pronounced cured, only six positive cases, 
or 6.1 per cent, could be detected; and to detect 
ova in these cases microscopic examination had 
to be made of from three to eight smeared slides 
from centrifuged specimens. ‘Thirty-seven of 
these 99 ‘cases had not been pronounced cured 
until at least nine days had elapsed following 
treatment; among these, only one specimen, or 
2.6 per cent, contained ova. 
The other eighteen of the 117 cases re- 
examined at the end of one month after being 
pronounced cured were cases that had been 
declared negative on re-examination less than
-P-A-G-E-209
  TREATMENT 209 
seven days after treatment. Among these 18 
cases two were found positive, or a percentage of 
II.I, as compared with the percentage of 6.1 
among the cases in which a lapse of at least seven 
days had been allowed. These figures, though 
not extensive enough to be conclusive, seem to 
indicate that in almost all cases, especially when 
at least nine days are allowed to elapse after 
treatment before re-examination is undertaken, 
the thorough examination of one specimen is 
sufficient for determing whether or not the 
patient has been cured. Of the few persons who 
were found positive one month after being pro- 
nounced cured on re-examinations made after a 
lapse of at least nine days (in the case of British 
Guiana 2.6 per cent of the cases re-examined), it 
may be that a large proportion were persons 
who had in their bodies at the time of re-examina- 
tion a few parasites en route to the intestines. 
IL 
TREATMENT 
One treatment for uncinariasis is seldom suffi- 
cient to effect a cure. Treatment must be 
repeated according to the severity of the infection 
and the efficacy of the drug used. It has been 
found that two treatments usually cure about 
50 per cent of the infected persons. The persons 
not usually cured by two treatments are those in 
whom the infection is of long standing and the
-P-A-G-E-210
  210 INTERNATIONAL HEALTH COMMISSION 
worms are so firmly buried that the anthelmintic 
has little effect upon them, or persons in whom 
the infection is very heavy and there are large 
numbers of worms to be expelled. Table 
3 shows that among 13,166 persons cured in the 
countries of British Guiana, Dutch Guiana, ‘St. 
Vincent, and Trinidad, 5,772, or 43.8 per cent, 
were cured by two treatments.

  The number of persons cured following each 
successive treatment has also been reported for 
these countries and is summarized in Table 
4. This shows that of the 13,166 persons cured, 
only 2,175, or 16.5 per cent, required more 
than four treatments. (See Table 4, page 211.) 
The total number of treatments administered 
in the dispensary work conducted during 1915 is 
shown in Table 5. (See Table 5, page 212.) 
In most of the countries thymol is the drug 
regularly used. This is usually administered in 
capsules, preceded and followed by a dose of

  TREATMENT 213 
Epsom salts. The object of the Epsom salts 
is to free the intestine from mucus or other sub- 
stances surrounding the hookworms and pro- 
tecting them from the action of the thymol. 
The patient is instructed to take little or no 
supper on the evening before the thymol is to 
be administered. As early at night as is con- 
venient he takes a dose of Epsom salts. The 
next morning as early as the salts has acted, 
half the number of capsules of thymol prescribed 
for the whole treatment are taken. T'wo hours 
later the remaining capsules are taken. Two 
hours after the second dose of thymol, another 
dose of Epsom salts is taken, which will expel 
the hookworms that have been forced to loosen 
their hold on the intestinal wall by the action 
of the thymol, and will also get rid of the excess 
of thymol before it has had time to produce any 
harmful effects on the patient. Nothing is eaten 
on the day the capsules are taken until the final 
dose of Epsom salts has acted well. A little water 
or strong coffee, without milk, alone is allowed. 
As alcohol and oils dissolve thymol, making 
it actively poisonous to the patient, the use of 
them in any form would be exceedingly danger- 
ous. Gravy, butter, milk, all alcoholic drinks, 
and patent medicines, which generally contain 
alcohol, are forbidden on the evening before and 
on the day of the treatment. Moreover, as 
many hookworm patients have dilated stom- 
achs which do not readily empty themselves
-P-A-G-E-214
  214 INTERNATIONAL HEALTH COMMISSION | 
and it is important that the thymol reach the 
small intestine at once, the patient is advised 
to lie on the right side for at least half an hour 
after taking each dose of thymol. 
The dosage administered by Drs. C. W. Stiles, 
George Dock, and C. C. Bass, by the State 
Boards of Health in the Southern States, and by 
a number of foreign countries, is outlined in the 
following table: 
Age, Years Grains Grams 6am. 8am.

Yedose 1% dose

60 and upward...... 45. 
It should be observed, however, that owing 
to the absence of hospital conditions and to the 
uncertainty in some cases that directions will 
be correctly followed, the dosage prescribed is 
usually from ten to twenty per cent less than 
that indicated in the foregoing table. The dose 
of thymol varies with the age of the patient. As 
the disease retards development and persons 
eighteen years old often have only the normal 
growth of thirteen, apparent and not actual age 
determines the dose. In all countries a compe- 
tent physician supervises the treatment. 
During 1915 a number of experiments were 
made with oil of chenopodium as a substitute 
for thymol. In Guatemala ‘more than 9,000
-P-A-G-E-215
TREATMENT 215 
persons were treated with this drug and par- 
ticularly favorable results were obtained. It 
was reported to be fully as efficient as thymol 
in the treatment of uncinariasis, and a better 
remedy in the treatment of other parasitic in- 
festations, especially ascariasis. Furthermore, 
this drug was found less trying on the patient, 
permitting a subsequent treatment within four 
days, which served to facilitate the work as well 
as to increase the number of subsequent treat- 
ments administered. Among these 9,000 per- 
sons only two cases of untoward symptoms were 
observed, both in children, in the form of tem- 
porary deafness lasting in one instance two 
weeks and in another four weeks. 
The standard dosage of oil of chenopodium 
used in Guatemala is as follows: 
Age in Years Drops   
   
-P-A-G-E-216
  216 INTERNATIONAL HEALTH COMMISSION 
These are maximum doses. They may be 
administered at one time or may be divided into 
two parts and administered one or two hours 
apart. There is no noticeable difference in re- 
sults by either method. 
In Nicaragua and Costa Rica excellent results 
have also been reported with the use of cheno- 
podium. In both countries the strong psychic 
effect produced by the expulsion of large num- 
bers of round worms, plainly visible to the naked 
eye, is considered a decided advantage in favor 
of this drug. No untoward symptoms have 
been observed. In Nicaragua it has been cus- 
tomary to administer chenopodium for the first 
and thymol for all succeeding treatments. 
In Trinidad, however, a series of experiments 
with oil of chenopodium gave less satisfactory 
results and led Dr. Washburn to conclude that 
there was nothing to justify adopting this drug 
in place of thymol as the standard remedy for 
uncinariasis. He finds it to be less effective 
than thymol and to produce more unpleasant 
symptoms, but recognizes that it may be used 
to advantage in selected cases where a large 
number of treatments with thymol fail to effect 
a cure. : 
For the experiments conducted in Trinidad 
342 selected cases of uncinariasis were taken. 
These included patients who had had no other 
treatment for the disease, as well as patients 
who had had from two to eight treatments with 
 
-P-A-G-E-217
TREATMENT 217 
thymol previous to the administration of cheno- 
podium. Of these 342 cases, 138 were treated 
by the Keith method, in which ten minims of 
chenopodium are given daily for three days, fol- 
lowed by a tablespoonful of castor oil two hours 
after the last dose has been taken; and the other 
204. cases received the full dose on one day, 
followed in two hours by a large dose of castor 
oil. In some cases magnesium sulphate was 
used instead of castor oil without any appreci- 
able difference in the result. 
Of the 138 cases treated by the Keith method, 
specimens for re-examination were obtained from 
113 three days after the last dose of chenopodium 
had been administered, as recommended by Dr. 
Keith, who states that in his experience it is 
rare to find the eggs of Uncinaria in stools exam- 
ined three days after the last dose of chenopo- 
dium is taken. Specimens from the remaining 
35 cases were not collected until the end of 
seven days following treatment, when all of the 
patients, including the 113 who had been re- 
examined at the end of three days, were re- 
examined. The results obtained at the end of 
three days and at the end of seven days following 
the last treatment are compared in Table 6. 
(See Table 6, page 218.) 
Forty-six of the persons whose specimens were 
re-examined both at the end of three days and 
seven days following the last treatment, were 
found negative at the end of three days and

positive at the end of seven days, showing that 
the figures obtained by the re-examination of 
specimens at the end of three days are unre- 
liable. This is probably due to the fact that 
the ‘drug exerts a toxic effect on the female 
worms, causing them to lay no eggs for several 
days after the treatment. The fact that the 
specimens collected three days after treatment 
contained but few eggs is indicated by the un- 
usually large percentage of specimens in which 
the eggs wefe not discovered until after the cen- 
trifuge had been used. 
In the 204 cases to whom the full dose of 
chenopodium was administered on the same 
day, 74 were given 10 minims every hour for 
-three hours, followed by a dose of castor oil 
after an interval of two hours; and 130 were 
given two capsules of 10 minims each with two 
hours’ interval between, followed by castor oil. 
Re-examination after seven days showed 27 of 
the 74 persons treated by the first method, or 
36.5 per cent, to have been cured; but this 
method had to be discontinued because of the 
large number of cases who were made sick and 
weak. Of the 130 cases treated by the second 
method, re-examination after seven days showed 
37, or 28.5 per cent, to have been cured. The 
remaining 93 patients were given a second treat- 
ment one week later and it was found that 39 
of these, or a total of 58.5 per cent of the original 
130 cases, had been cured by the two treatments.
-P-A-G-E-220
220 INTERNATIONAL HEALTH COMMISSION 
In all of the cases treated with oil of 
chenopodium in Trinidad, unpleasant symp- 
toms, such as nausea, vomiting, weakness, dizzi- 
ness, etc., were much more marked than with 
thymol, and the continued use of chenopo- 
dium in a district alarmed the people and made 
them afraid to take further treatment of any 
kind. 
Experiments were also conducted in Trinidad 
for determining the efficiency of thymol when 
administered in capsule form with varying pro- 
portions of sugar of milk. Re-examinations 
were made in all cases after two treatments had 
been administered. ‘The results show that the 
drug is much more effective when finely pulver- 
ized and mixed with at least an equal amount of 
sugar of milk. Among 325 cases treated with 
pure thymol, finely powdered, only 41, or 12.6 
per cent, were cured by two treatments, while 
among 1,112 persons treated with finely pow- 
dered thymol mixed with equal parts of sugar of 
milk, 546, or 49.1 per cent, were cured by two 
treatments. 
During September, 1915, a supply of thymol 
already mixed with sugar of milk and packed in 
capsules by the manufacturer was received. 
This thymol was not as finely powdered as that 
which had been previously compounded in 
Trinidad, and the proportions of sugar of milk 
to thymol, instead of being equal, were as fol- 
lows: 
 
-P-A-G-E-221
  TREATMENT 221 
Io grains thymol to 214 grains sugar of milk; 
5 grains thymol to 5 grains sugar of milk (but 
not finely powdered); 
2 grains thymol to I grain sugar of milk. 
The results following the use of this supply 
were far less satisfactory than had previously 
been obtained. In three districts only 76 per- 
sons among a total of 350, or 21.7 per cent, were 
cured by two treatments. The drug was re- 
compounded and mixed with equal parts of 
sugar of milk, when the number of cures follow- 
ing two treatments again rose to nearly 50 per 
cent.

CHINA MEDICAL BOARD 
ORIGIN AND PURPOSES OF THE BOARD 
The origin and purposes of the China Medical 
Board are succinctly stated in the following 
letter, addressed by the President of the Rocke- 
feller Foundation to the Missionary Societies 
in the United States and Great Britain which 
are conducting medical work in China: 
“New York, March 15, 1915. 
“My dear Sir: 
“For some time the Rockefeller Foundation has been 
considering the need of scientific medicine in China and 
how best the Foundation might assist in meeting the need. 
A tentative general plan of procedure was adopted nearly 
a year ago, after conference with many eminent authorities 
on the subject. A competent Commission has since then 
visited China and studied with great care present medical 
conditions in that country. The Commission has now 
made a comprehensive report and has offered a series of 
recommendations. These recommendations have been 
tentatively adopted by the Foundation, subject to such 
changes as experience and further inquiry may suggest. 
“Happily, the Foundation is not first in the field. Many 
and various missionary societies of America, Great Britain 
and the Continent have preceded it. Hundreds of 
physicians are now practicing in China under the auspices 
of these societies. Their patients number tens of thou- 
sands, perhaps hundreds of thousands, annually. As 
rapidly as possible, hospitals have been and are being 
established. In some cases these are fairly well equipped, 
but all of them are still very needy. Half a score or 
more of medical colleges have been started, partially 
manned and equipped, and these colleges are being availed 
of by hundreds of Chinese students, with such prepara- 
tion, more or less adequate, as circumstances have 
admitted. The Missionary Boards have been most zealous 
in medical missions and have done everything possible, 
with the limited resources at their disposal, toward making 
245 
 
-P-A-G-E-246
       
   246 CHINA MEDICAL BOARD 
this work effective. With these societies and with the 
work undertaken by them, the Foundation from the first 
has contemplated the most cordial and sympathetic co- 
operation. We desire to supplement the work of the 
Missionary Boards where it is incomplete, to multiply it 
where it is inadequate, and always to engraft our addi- 
tions in an entirely vital way. We cannot expect, even 
did we desire it, that the societies would materially 
change their principles or methods or the religious quali- 
fications of their appointees, except as the societies may 
be self-moved to do so by experience and observation. 
“But the medical work of the Missionary Societies and 
Boards is confined to limited areas and is seriously re- 
stricted by lack of funds. In carrying out its comprehen- 
sive plans, the Foundation may find it desirable: 
“1. To assist Missionary Societies to strengthen 
their medical schools and hospitals by providing 
equipment and other facilities, and by making 
annual grants, as may be found expedient, for the 
support of physicians and nurses, selected by the 
respective Missionary Boards, subject only to the 
Foundation’s approval of the professional qualifica- 
tions of the appointees. 
“2. With the consent of the Missionary Boards, 
to reorganize and expand existing medical schools, 
with their hospitals, and to support these, wholly 
or in part, from its own funds. — 
“3, To aid other medical schools that are not 
strictly missionary. 
“4. Toestablish, equip and support new medical 
schools and hospitals. In choosing its agents, 
physicians and nurses for independent schools or 
hospitals, the Foundation will select only persons 
of sound sense and high character, who are sympa- 
thetic with the missionary spirit and motive, who 
are thoroughly qualified for their work profes- 
sionally, and who will dedicate themselves to 
medical ministration in China. Beyond these 
qualifications, the Foundation cannot properly 
impose tests of a denominational or doctrinal 
nature, such as are deemed desirable by Missionary 
Boards for their own medical missionaries or agents.
-P-A-G-E-247
DECLARATION OF PURPOSES 247 
*“In entering upon its work, the Foundation will hope 
to avail itself of the long and valuable experience acquired 
by the Missionary Boards in the conduct of their medical 
missions, and will welcome their sympathetic counsel in 
all matters of procedure and administration. 
“While this work of the Foundation will be limited to 
medical service, we believe it to be the highest duty and 
privilege of all men to cherish the spirit of Jesus, and ever 
to live and act in that spirit. The desire of earnest 
Christians to communicate the spirit of Jesus to the 
Chinese and to the whole world we share to the full. We 
share with the Missionary Boards also their conviction 
that the teachin'g of Jesus must be imparted to the 
Chinese through preaching and by all other proper agencies 
for communicating truth, and we are constantly mindful 
that, in so far as we may be able to assist the Missionary 
Boards in their medical service, the Boards will be enabled 
to devote added funds to the strengthening and enlarging 
of their educational and evangelistic work. 
“As its agency for conducting this work, the Founda- 
tion has formed the China Medical Board, with offices at 
61 Broadway, New York, and has conferred upon this 
Board the necessary powers and the financial resources 
believed to be currently needed. The Chairman of the 
Board is John D. Rockefeller, Jr.; the Director, Wallace 
Buttrick; Resident Director in China, Roger S. Greene, 
formerly United States Consul-General at Hankow, China.

  248 CHINA MEDICAL BOARD 
The Commission of 1914, referred to in the 
foregoing letter, consisted of Harry Pratt Jud- 
son, President of the University of Chicago, Dr. 
Francis W. Peabody, of the Harvard Medical 
School, Boston, and Roger §. Greene, then 
Consul-General of the United States at Hankow, 
China. This-Commission visited the several 
medical schools in China and a large number 
of hospitals, missionary and other. Upon its 
return to the United States, the Commission 
made a comprehensive report to the Founda- 
tion, afterwards printed under the title “‘Medi- 
cine in China,” and presented a series of recom- 
mendations, which were adopted at the meeting 
of the Foundation, November 5, 1914, under the 
following resolution: 
“RESOLVED, That the Report of the China 
Medical Commission be accepted and the recom- 
mendations of the same be adopted as a working 
basis, together with the financial estimates with 
which they are accompanied, the whole or any part 
thereof subject to such changes and emendations 
as experience and further knowledge shall from 
time to time invite.” 
At a meeting of the Executive Committee 
of the Foundation, held November 30, 1914, 
the following further action was taken: 
“RESOLVED, That an organization be created 
to take up the work of medical education in China, 
as recommended in the report of the China Medical 
Commission and in accordance with the resolution 
adopted at the meeting of November 5, and that 
such organization be designated as the China 
Medical Board of the Rockefeller Foundation.”
-P-A-G-E-249
  ORGANIZATION OF THE BOARD 249 
The Board met for organization December 
11, 1914, all the members being present with 
the exception of Dr. Wickliffe Rose, who was 
engaged in war relief work in Europe, and Dr. 
William H. Welch, who was unavoidably detain- 
ed. Mr. Roger S. Greene was present by 
invitation. Mr. John D. Rockefeller, Jr., stated 
the circumstances leading to the formation of 
the Board and pointed out some of the questions 
which would confront the Board in formulat- 
ing its policies. He urged that the work be 
undertaken in a spirit of codperation with 
existing agencies for medical education in 
China, and particularly with the medical schools 
and hospitals established by the missionary 
societies. 
The following officers were appointed: 
Chairman, John D. Rockefeller, Jr. 
Director, Wallace Buttrick. 
Resident Director in China, Roger S. Greene. 
Secretary, E. C. Sage. 
Executive Committee: Wallace Buttrick, Frederick 
T. Gates, Jerome D. Greene, Starr.J. Murphy, 
Francis W. Peabody, John D. Rockefeller, Jr. 
On May 26, 1915, Mr. Jerome D. Greene 
resigned his membership in the Board, and on 
the same day Mr. Frederick T. Gates was 
appointed Vice-Chairman. 
The Board has held three meetings: De- 
cember 11, 1914, March 1, 1915, and May 25, 
1915. The Executive Committee has held four
-P-A-G-E-250
  250 CHINA MEDICAL BOARD 
meetings: April 15, June 22, July 10, and 
October 27, 1915. 
In July, 1915, Mr. Roger S. Greene sailed 
for China and as Resident Director opened an 
office of the Board in Peking. 
UNION MEDICAL COLLEGE, PEKING 
The first important act of the Board was the 
acquisition of the property of the Union Medi- 
cal College in Peking. 
This medical college, from which the first 
class graduated in I911, was maintained and 
directed by six Christian Missionary Societies: 
The London Missionary Society (non-sectarian, 
but closely affiliated with the Congregational 
Churches of Great Britain), The Society for the 
Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts 
(Church of England), The ‘London Medical 
Missionary Association, The American Board 
of Commissioners for Foreign Missions (Con- 
gregational), The Board of Foreign Missions of 
the (American) Methodist Episcopal Church, 
and The Board of Foreign Missions of the 
Presbyterian Church in the United States of 
America. The property of the College was 
owned by the London Missionary Society, for 
which Society Dr. Thomas Cochrane estab- 
lished the work in 1906. Since that date the 
college has been supported jointly by the six 
missionary societies named above. 
Early in 1915, the Director and Mr. Roger
-P-A-G-E-251
UNION MEDICAL COLLEGE, PEKING 251 
S. Greene conferred with representatives of the 
three American Missionary Societies interested 
in the College, when it was agreed that the 
China Medical Board might approach the 
London Missionary Society with a proposal to 
purchase the property of the College. Under 
the instructions of the Board, the Director 
visited London in March and April, 1915, to 
negotiate with the London Missionary Society. 
While in London he attended several meetings 
for conference with officers and committees of 
that society, with representatives of the Society 
for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign 
Parts, and of the London Medical Missionarv 
Association. : 
As a result of these conferences, the London 
Missionary Society agreed to sell the property 
of the Union Medical College in Peking, 
together with the mission compound of the 
Society, located on Hatamen Street, near the 
Medical College, to the China Medical Board 
of the Rockefeller Foundation, and later sent 
Dr. Thomas Cochrane, President Emeritus of 
the College, to this country with full power to 
act for the London Missionary Society in 
completing arrangements for the transfer of 
the property. On June 2, 1915, a memoran- 
dum of agreement between the London Mis- 
sionary Society and the China Medical Board 
was executed, which provided for the sale of 
the property of the Union Medical College in’ 
 
-P-A-G-E-252
       
   252 CHINA MEDICAL BOARD 
Peking and the mission compound mentioned 
above to the China Medical Board of the 
Rockefeller Foundation. Subsequently the titles 
to the property were perfected and the transfer 
and sale consummated. 
The terms of the transfer provided, among 
other things, that the work of the college should 
be conducted by a Board of Trustees, which 
should consist of thirteen members, one.to be 
appointed by each of the six missionary organi- 
zations theretofore maintaining the college, 
and seven by the China Medical Board. Under 
this agreement the following trustees have been 
appointed: 
Representing the China Medical Board: Wallace 
Buttrick, Simon Flexner, Frederick T. Gates, John 
R. Mott, John D. Rockefeller, Jr., Wickliffe Rose, 
William H. Welch. 
Representing the London Missionary Society: 
F. H. Hawkins. 
Representing the Medical Missionary Associa- 
tion of London: Arthur Wenham. 
Representing the Society for the Propagation of 
the Gospel in Foreign Parts: J. Auriol Armitage. 
Representing the Board of Foreign Missions of 
the Methodist Episcopal Church: Frank Mason 
North. 
Representing the Board of Foreign Missions of 
the Presbyterian Church in the United States of 
America: Arthur J. Brown. 
Representing the American Board of Commis- 
sioners for Foreign Missions: James L. Barton. 
The following are the officers of the Board of 
Trustees of Union Medical College: 
Chairman, John R. Mott. 
Vice-Chairman, James L. Barton.

    COMMISSION OF 1o15 253 
Secretary, Wallace Buttrick. 
Executive Committee: Frederick T. Gates, Chair- 
man; Arthur J. Brown, Wallace Buttrick, Simon 
Flexner, Frank Mason North. 
Committee on Nominations to the Faculty: Wallace 
Buttrick, Simon Flexner, William H. Welch, 
Frank Mason North, Arthur J. Brown. 
On July 1, 1915, the China Medical Board 
assumed full support of the College, with an 
annual budget of fifty-three thousand dollars 
($53,000). 
The Board has since purchased the residence 
property of Mr. Ying, adjoining the Union 
Medical College to the south, thus increasing 
the campus of the college by about one and 
two-fifths acres. Negotiations are also pend- 
ing for the purchase of additional property 
adjoining the hospital of the college, belonging 
to Prince I, and for the extensive residence 
property of Prince Yu, some three hundred 
feet west of the laboratory building of the 
college, the latter being a tract of more than 
eight acres. 
COMMISSION OF 1915 
In May, 1915, the Board, by resolution, 
requested the Director, Dr. William H. Welch, 
of the Johns Hopkins Medical School, Drs. 
Simon Flexner and Frederick L. Gates, of the 
Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research, and 
Mr. Frederick T. Gates, Vice-Chairman of the 
Board, to visit China and report a definite 
program for the reorganization of the Peking
-P-A-G-E-254
  
  254 CHINA MEDICAL BOARD 
Union Medical College, and also to consider 
more particularly whether the Board might not 
organize a second college to be situated in 
Shanghai. On the 7th of August the members 
of the Commission sailed from San Francisco 
for China, returning December 27, 1915. At the 
last moment, Mr. Frederick 'T. Gates found it 
impossible to go. 
During the five months of their absence from 
this country the members of the Commission 
visited medical schools and hospitals in Tokyo 
and Kyoto, Japan; Seoul, Korea; and the fol- 
lowing places in China: Mukden, Peking, Tien- 
tsin, Tsinanfu, Hankow, Wuchang, Changsha, 
Nanking, Shanghai, Soochow, Hangchow, Hong- 
kong and Canton. Mr. Roger S. Greene joined 
the Commission at Mukden and thereafter par- 
ticipated in their journeys and work. Dr. 
Frederick L. Gates was Secretary of the Com- 
mission and made a record of all its proceedings, 
which he has filed with the archives of the 
Board. ; 
During their brief stay in Japan the members 
of the Commission were entertained by leading 
medical men of the country. They also met 
a number of prominent Japanese and foreign 
residents at a dinner given by Dr. Teusler, of 
the International Hospital, and later were enter- 
tained at luncheon by Count (now Marquis) 
Okuma. 
Upon their arrival in China, the Commission
-P-A-G-E-255
  COMMISSION OF rors 255 
was welcomed by the American Minister, Dr. 
Paul S. Reinsch, and his associates of the Ameri- 
can Legation, who in manifold ways aided the 
members in their work. At Peking they were 
entertained at luncheon by the Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, and through his courtesy and 
that of Dr. Reinsch they had the honor of an 
interview with the late President of the Chinese 
Republic, Yuan Shih-k’ai. The members of the 
Commission were also given a dinner by a large 
company of Chinese physicians, who expressed 
great satisfaction with the plans of the Rocke- 
feller Foundation to introduce and to teach 
modern medicine in China and promised their 
cordial support. 
The limits of this report forbid mention of 
many institutions and individuals who wel- 
comed and furthered the work of the Com- 
mission. The faculty of the Union Medical 
College, Peking, codperated with them whole- 
heartedly, the representatives of the several 
Christian Missionary Societies welcomed them 
warmly, and throughout their extended jour- 
ney they found that the spirit of friendliness 
and helpfulness had gone before them. In 
Hankow they were entertained by the Uni- 
versity Club of that city, of which organization 
their associate, Mr. Roger S. Greene, was the 
first President; in Changsha by the Military 
Governor, the chief executive of the city, the 
members of the Yale Mission and by a large

company of Hunanese gentry; at Shanghai by 
St. John’s University, the Saturday Club, the 
University Club, the Kiangsu Educational 
Association (Chinese), the East China Mission- 
ary Educational Association, and by the 
executive secretaries of the several missionary 
organizations which have their headquarters in 
Shanghai; at Nanking by President Bowen and 
his associates of the Nanking University. At all 
places visited the representatives of missions, 
American and English, assisted the Commission 
in its work 
This extended journey, with its opportunity 
for studying medical and other educational 
institutions and agencies in China, served the 
important purpose of giving the Director and 
three of his associates on the China Medical 
Board a first-hand contact with the people, 
cities and institutions of China. The Board is 
deeply indebted to Doctor Welch and Doctor 
Flexner for their services and to the Johns 
Hopkins University and the Rockefeller In- 
stitute for Medical Research for giving them 
leave of absence. ‘Their presence on the Com- 
mission and the China Medical Board estab- 
lishes the movement in the confidence of the 
medical profession throughout the world. 
The Commission did not return to New 
York until January, 1916. Its specific recom- 
mendations, therefore, were not presented to 
the Board during the year covered by this
-P-A-G-E-257
  SHANGHAI 257 
report. One or two important general recom- 
mendations should, however, appear in this 
statement. 
SHANGHAI 
While the members of the Commission were 
in Shanghai and Nanking, they consulted with 
Bishop Graves and Acting President Walker, of 
St. John’s University; with Dr. Houghton and 
his associates of the Harvard Medical School 
in China, and with President Bowen and his 
associates of Nanking University. Under date 
of November 5, 1915, the following communi- 
cation was received from Dr. Beebe, Secretary 
of the China Medical Missionary Association: 
“5 Quinsan Gardens, Shanghai, 
“November 5, 1915. 
“Dear Dr. Buttrick: 
“At a meeting of representatives, regularly appointed, 
of St. John’s University, University of Pennsylvania 
Medical School, University of Nanking and the Harvard 
Medical School of China, the accompanying resolution 
was passed unanimously and I was instructed to bring 
the same to your attention. 
‘Very truly yours, 
(Signed) ““‘ROBERT C. BEEBE.” 
“Tnasmuch as the China Medical Board of the Rocke- 
feller Foundation has in view the establishment of a 
medical school in Shanghai which shall work in cordial 
and sympathetic codperation with missionary societies, 
and in which it is desired to merge existing medical schools, 
the representatives of St. John’s University and Penn- 
sylvania Medical School of the University of Nanking, 
and of the Harvard Medical School of China, in a joint 
meeting, held in Shanghai, Thursday, November 4, 1915, 
extend a cordial invitation to the China Medical Board

to establish in Shanghai a Medical School which shall be 
conducted by a board of trustees upon which would be 
represented the governing bodies of the codperating 
schools.” 
After consultation with his associates, the 
Director sent the following reply to Dr. Beebe’s 
letter: 
“Shanghai, November 7, 1915. 
“Dear Dr. Beebe: 
“Thank you for your letter of November 5th covering 
the resolution passed by the representatives of St. John’s 
University, the University of Pennsylvania Medical 
School, the University of Nanking and the Harvard 
Medical School of China. This resolution will be presented 
to the China Medical Board at its meeting, which should 
be held the latter part of January, 1916, and you will of 
course be promptly advised of any action that the Board 
may take at that time relating to the matter. 
“Tn the meantime, I might add that our Commission 
feels gratified that these organizations have, through this 
voluntary action, manifested their sympathetic interest 
in the larger scheme. which we have in mind for the 
promotion of higher medical education in China. 
“Thanking you and your associates for your manifold 
courtesies during our stay in Shanghai, I am 
“Cordially yours, 
(Signed) “WALLACE BUTTRICK.” 
At a meeting of the China Medical Board, 
held April 6, 1916, it was voted to establish a 
medical college in Shanghai, and a committee 
to select trustees and secure a charter for the 
college has been appointed.

Acting on the recommendation of the Com- 
mission of 1914, the Board has contributed

    THE AIDING OF MISSIONARY HOSPITALS 259 
$16,200 a year for five years to the Hunan-Yale 
Medical School at Changsha. The Commission 
of 1915 spent two days at Changsha and were 
much pleased with the progress that has been 
made in organizing the medical school as well 
as with the remarkable evidences of public- 
spirited codperation on the part of the gentry 
of the province. The new site is a most desir- 
able one, and the hospital promises to be one of 
the best in China. Dr. Welch laid the corner- 
stone of the new hospital while the Commission 
were in the city. : 
THE AIDING OF MISSIONARY HOSPITALS 
In his letter to the Missionary Societies, the 
Chairman of the China Medical Board stated 
that in carrying out its comprehensive plans 
the Board may find it desirable “to assist Mis- 
sionary Societies to strengthen their medical 
schools and hospitals by providing equipment 
and other facilities and by making annual grants, 
as may be found expedient, for the support of 
physicians and nurses selected by the respective 
Missionary Boards, subject only to the Foun- 
dation’s approval of the professional qualifica- 
tions of the appointees.” 
In carrying out this proposal, the China 
Medical Board has decided that it should first 
aid those hospitals which are easily accessible 
from the leading medical schools to be developed 
at Peking and in the lower Yangtze Valley.

This means hospitals in cities which can be 
conveniently reached by rail or water trans- 
portation within perhaps one or two days’ 
journey from the cities where the schools are 
located. In pursuance of this general program, 
a few appropriations were made before the 
departure of the Director for China in August, 
1915. Following are the hospitals thus aided:

CONCLUSION 
Before closing this report, it may be well to 
refer to a few other matters, although they do 
not actually fall within the period under review. 
On April 6, 1916, the China Medical Board 
voted to support the Red Cross Hospital in 
Shanghai for two years, under the direction of 
Dr. Henry S. Houghton, for over three years 
head of the Harvard Medical School of China, 
which on June 30, 1916, terminated its useful 
career of the past five years. On April 6, 1916, 
the China Medical Board appointed Mr. Charles 
A. Coolidge, of Boston, Consulting Architect, 
and commissioned him to proceed to China, 
where, with the assistance of the Resident- 
Director, he is to study the conditions in Peking 
and Shanghai. In June, 1916, Dr. Franklin C. 
McLean, a graduate of the University of 
Chicago and of the Rush Medical College, and 
for the past year and a half Assistant Physician 
at the hospital of the Rockefeller Institute for 
 
-P-A-G-E-264
  264 CHINA MEDICAL BOARD 
Medical Research, was unanimously selected as 
Professor of Internal Medicine and head of the 
Union Medical College in Peking. Dr. McLean 
and Mr. Coolidge sailed on July 13 from 
Vancouver for Yokohama, where they were met 
by Mr. Greene. 
In conclusion, the Director wishes to record 
his appreciation of the friendly codperation of 
the several Missionary Societies with the Board 
in their efforts to develop the science and prac- 
tice of medicine in China.

    WAR RELIEF COMMISSION 
ACTIVITIES IN 1914 
In the first annual report of the Rockefeller 
Foundation appears an account of the activities 
of the Foundation during 1914 in the relief of 
suffering caused by the war. These activities 
are briefly summarized below in order to promote 
a clearer understanding of the work of the 
Foundation throughout the past year. 
1. The Foundation, codperating with the Commission 
for Relief in Belgium, provided the greater part of five 
cargoes of food and other supplies for Belgian relief. 
These supplies cost approximately $1,000,000. 
2. An appropriation at the rate of $20,000 a year was 
made to provide stipends for certain professors in Belgian 
universities who were refugees in England. 
3. Dr. Alexis Carrel, a member of the Rockefeller Insti- 
tute for Medical Research, whose services had been ac- 
cepted by the Medical Corps of the French army, was 
provided with funds enabling him to respond to urgent 
calls for anti-meningitis serum and anti-dysentery serum. 
4. The American Red Cross was given $10,000 to meet 
the expenses of sending a detachment of physicians and 
nurses to Europe. 
5. A War Relief Commission was organized and sent to 
Europe to inquire generally into the need of relief measures 
in all the countries affected by the war. In November 
and December, 1914, this Commission made a survey of 
the organization and working of relief in Belgium and 
Holland and transmitted to the Foundation a full report 
of its observations and recommendations. 
During 1915, the field of war relief work 
widened rapidly. One or more of the members of 269
-P-A-G-E-270
270 WAR RELIEF COMMISSION 
the War Relief Commission visited each of the 
countries engaged in the war. They reported 
fully upon the conditions observed and made 
numerous recommendations to the Foundation 
regarding possible relief activities. Apart from 
the reports received from the Commission, the 
Foundation was informed by numerous individ- 
uals and war relief agencies of conditions of 
widespread and appalling distress among refugees 
in various countries of Europe and Asia. The 
conditions existing in the different areas affected 
and the aid given by the Foundation are here 
described.1. For convenience, the account of 
the work in each country is given separately. 
NORTHERN FRANCE 
To the summary of the war relief activities of 
the Foundation during 1914 must be appended 
an account of a tour of inspection made by the 
War Relief Commission in the latter part of 
December, 1914, in that portion of French 
territory which lay between the battle front and 
the frontier of Belgium and was in the control of 
the German military authorities. The inquiry 
began on December 17th, at Valenciennes. From 
there the tour extended northeast to Douai, 
south as far as St. Quentin, east and southeast 
to Rethel, then northeast to Sedan, then north-

west and north to Fumay and Givet. From 
Givet the Commission returned to Brussels via 
Philipville and Charleroi on December 21st. 
As a result of this inspection, the members of 
the Commission were strongly impressed with 
the importance of providing early relief for the 
people in this French territory, cut off as they 
were from their central government, from their 
banking connections, their markets, and their 
chief source of supplies. Upon their return to 
Brussels the Commission took the matter up 
with the Belgian National Committee and with 
the German authorities. 
The National Committee of Belgium (Comité 
de Secours et d’Alimentation de Belgique) is 
an organization of Belgians, representing all 
political parties and the leaders of Belgian 
business and finance. The Committee ap- 
portions to the provinces of Belgium the supplies 
which are procured and transported by the Com- 
mission for Relief in Belgium and supervises the 
distribution of the supplies to the people within 
the communes. 
The National Committee hesitated to assume 
jurisdiction for relief purposes over the strip of 
French territory occupied by the German army, 
but after some discussion with the members of 
the War Relief Commission the Committee 
agreed to forward relief supplies through their 
regularly organized machinery, treating the 
territory exactly as though it were a part of
-P-A-G-E-272
  
272 WAR RELIEF COMMISSION 
Belgium. The Committee announced, however, 
that their action did not establish a precedent 
as to any other section of France, and that this 
strip was taken in solely because it was isolated 
from France by the destruction of all means of 
transportation from the south. Under the 
arrangement agreed upon, food was sent into 
the French towns from the Belgian provincial 
headquarters at Namur. 
THE RELIEF OF BELGIAN REFUGEES IN HOLLAND 
Following the occupation of Belgium by the 
German forces, probably 800,000 Belgians 
crossed the border and sought refuge in Holland. 
The people fled in panic, carrying few of their 
belongings. A majority seemed to have saved 
nothing beyond the clothing they wore. The 
Queen of Holland issued a proclamation wel- 
coming the refugees and promising shelter and 
protection to all. 
It quickly became evident that private re- 
sources could not meet the situation thus 
suddenly created. Relief committees were or- 
ganized in many cities and towns, contributions 
were called for, and systematic efforts to feed 
and shelter those who could not be taken into 
private houses were promptly set on foot. Ina 
few weeks it became necessary to relieve many 
households of the heavy burden of expense and 
the serious inconvenience which they had gener- 
ously assumed. Thus more and more of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-273
  BELGIAN REFUGEES IN HOLLAND 273 
refugees were gathered into large buildings or 
camps, where they were provided with beds and 
food by local committees. A national committee 
was organized, with headquarters in Amsterdam, 
and this committee undertook to do something 
toward raising relief funds and creating a supply 
of clothing from which the meager resources of 
the local committees might in some measure be 
supplemented. All these efforts fell far short of 
meeting the situation, especially as a large and 
increasing stream of refugees flowed from private 
houses into the shelters provided by the com- 
mittees. 
Eventually the Netherlands government as- 
sumed the greater part of the burden. It began 
by making a small per capita allowance for the 
feeding of refugees, but quickly followed this by 
the adoption of a policy of creating large con- 
centration camps, into which it caused to be 
transferred the refugees from the small camps 
maintained by local relief committees. The 
government also assumed the expense of ad- 
ministering the camps and of feeding their 
occupants. 
Many refugees later returned to Belgium, 
others went to England and a few were able to 
assume their own support. By January I, 1915, 
the number of Belgian refugees in Holland had 
fallen to between 250,000 and 400,000. 
The cost to the Netherlands government of 
this great charity was so large as to necessitate 
 
-P-A-G-E-274
  274 WAR RELIEF COMMISSION 
the issue of bonds as a means of obtaining the 
money necessary to support the work of relief. 
At the concentration camps, large private and 
public buildings were occupied, when available, 
and elsewhere temporary wooden barracks were 
constructed, provided with simple equipment 
for meeting the primary human needs. A Royal 
Commission was created to represent the govern- 
ment in the direction and supervision of the 
camps. 
In the latter part of November and early 
December, members of the War Relief Commis- 
sion of the Rockefeller Foundation inspected 
several of the refugee camps in Holland and 
conferred with officers of a number of local 
relief committees. The enforced idleness of the 
inmates deeply impressed the Commission. It 
was evident that no means of providing whole- 
some employment had been devised, and, indeed, 
the difficulties in the way of employment were 
serious. Holland was suffering a business depres- 
sion as an immediate effect of the war, and was 
struggling with a heavy problem of unemploy- 
ment among her own people. At the same time, 
it was obvious that months of idleness in the 
enervating atmosphere of the camps could not 
but have a deteriorating influence upon the 
refugees. 
In December, the Commission appointed Mr. 
Charles Jenkinson as its special representative 
in Holland, and upon his arrival toward the end
-P-A-G-E-275
BELGIAN REFUGEES IN HOLLAND 275 
of the month he was set to work investigating 
conditions in the refugee camps. The following 
facts were brought out by this investigation: 
1. The Netherlands Government was prepared to pro- 
vide shelter and food for the refugees but did not feel that 
it could do more. 
2. Refugees were suffering intensely for lack of warm 
clothing, a need which the local relief committees were try- 
ing vainly to meet. Many cases of disease due to exposure 
were reported, and mortality was abnormally high. 
3. Enforced, universal idleness was threatening to under- 
mine the energy and character of the refugees. 
Before Mr. Jenkinson’s investigation, the War 
Relief Commission were informed by officers at 
the. Rotterdam office of the Commission for 
Relief in Belgium that large shipments of clothes 
(chiefly second-hand) intended for the Belgians 
were arriving at Rotterdam. As the Commission 
for Relief in Belgium were not prepared to 
handle clothing, these shipments were going into 
Belgium in an unsystematic way, and were, in 
fact, accumulating rapidly in a temporary ware- 
house in Rotterdam. It was apparent also that 
a fair proportion of the clothing should be distrib- 
uted to the refugees in Holland. An inspection of 
this contributed clothing, however, revealed 
very little underclothing. 
After considering the conditions disclosed by 
these investigations, the War Relief Commission 
undertook to classify, pack and re-ship the cloth- 
ing contributed from all parts of the world,   
 
-P-A-G-E-276
276 WAR RELIEF COMMISSION 
apportioning it properly between Belgium and 
Holland; and also, as an experiment, to provide 
employment for some of the idle refugees by 
giving them an opportunity to make clothing 
for themselves and their compatriots. 
DISTRIBUTION OF CLOTHING 
By arrangement with the Rotterdam office of 
the Commission for Relief in Belgium, Mr. 
Jenkinson was appointed to take charge of all 
contributed clothing. The clothing which was 
coming in had been sent from the United States, 
Canada and England. It was of good quality 
and much of it absolutely new. Only a small 
portion of it, however, was packed, classified 
and marked in such a manner as to make it 
possible for those in charge of the distribution 
to know what was contained in any given case. 
To classify and distribute this clothing the War 
Relief Commission were given free use of a 
small warehouse in Rotterdam. When this 
warehouse was opened it was determined that 
as far as possible the labor should be performed 
by Belgian men and women, refugees from 
Belgium, who might in that way be enabled to 
support themselves. Men to handle the cases 
and women required for sorting and packing the 
clothing were quickly secured from among 
refugees in the neighborhood. Besides a small 
compensation given these Belgians for their 
work, they were also allowed, each Saturday 
 
-P-A-G-E-277
DISTRIBUTION OF CLOTHING 277 
night, to take home one large piece of clothing, 
according to their requirements. Accurate 
records were kept of the articles taken by each 
employee and nobody was allowed to take the 
same article of apparel twice. 
The warehouse was large enough to allow 
from 150 to 300 cases of clothing to be made 
ready for shipment each working day. Early in 
January, however, it was decided to hasten the 
work of assorting and distributing the clothing 
in order that the Belgians might get the benefit 
of the heavy clothing while the weather was still 
cold. Another warehouse was therefore secured, 
with a capacity of from 300 to 550 cases of cloth- 
ing each day, and the force of employees was 
materially increased. During the life of this 
organization a number of people varying from 
50 to 100 were given employment for periods 
ranging from one to five months each. 
Following is a summarized statement of the 
distribution of clothing made by the Rotter- 
dam organization:

In addition to the clothing, 357 cases of food 
 
-P-A-G-E-278
  278 WAR RELIEF COMMISSION 
and 1,483 cases of toys and miscellaneous 
articles packed with the clothing were also 
handled. 
On April 20, 1915, work having fallen off, 
Mr. Jenkinson closed the larger of the two ware- 
houses used for the sorting and re-packing of 
clothing. On May 12th, the Commission for 
Relief in Belgium stated that they knew of no 
further shipments of clothing consigned to Rot- 
terdam, but that if additional shipments were 
received they could be handled efficiently in 
Brussels. The clothing department was there- 
fore closed. . 
The War Relief Commission, in attempting 
to provide work for some of the refugees, asked 
the Committee in charge of a concentration 
camp in Rotterdam to codperate in establishing 
a sewing department. All the women in the 
camp were called together and asked as to their 
ability to use sewing machines, to sew by hand 
and to knit. They were also asked whether 
they would be willing to help manufacture un- 
derwear, not for their own use alone, but for 
the use of other refugees. Their response was 
so prompt and hearty that the Commission was 
encouraged to go forward with the experiment. 
A professional dressmaker from Brussels, her- 
self a refugee, was engaged as supervisor of the 
first class, which was also under the supervision 
of a committee of Dutch ladies. Light, airy 
rooms were set aside for the sewing. Fifty 
 
-P-A-G-E-279
  SEWING AND KNITTING BY REFUGEES 279 
women entered the class. Material was pro- 
vided and twelve sewing machines were in- 
stalled, together with other necessary equipment, 
such as scissors, needles, thread, etc. A supply 
of woolen yarn was provided for women and 
girls who could not sew, but who could knit 
stockings. From the first the experiment was 
successful. The manager of the camp was 
enthusiastic over the better spirit which ap- 
peared among the women. Steadily, but with 
no great. rapidity, new, warm garments accu- 
mulated. Careful accounting was made for all 
goods provided. The scraps from cutting were 
saved and groups of young girls and children 
were set to piecing quilts from them. This 
class, in one week, produced 459 articles of 
clothing, two-thirds of which were drawers and 
undershirts for men and one-third assorted ar- 
ticles for women and children. 
When the Rotterdam experiment was in full 
operation, the Chairman of the Commission, in 
company with the American Minister at the 
Hague, called upon the Foreign Minister, and 
explained fully the industrial venture estab- 
lished in the camp in Rotterdam. The Minister 
was much interested and asked whether the 
Commission would be willing to extend their 
operations into other camps. This the Com- 
mission agreed to do. 
As the winter was far advanced and the need 
for underwear extreme, it had seemed unwise to 
   
-P-A-G-E-280
280 WAR RELIEF COMMISSION 
rely solely upon the supply to be manufactured 
in the camps and the small quantities included 
in the contributed shipments of clothing. The 
Commission accordingly purchased, on bids 
from local manufacturers, about 10,000 suits of 
underwear for distribution in the various camps 
where extreme instances of individual need were 
reported. 
Under the plan of the War Relief Commission, 
approved by the Netherlands Government, work- 
rooms were provided by the different commu- 
nities or camps. The Commission furnished 
supervisors, sewing machines, materials and 
compensation for the workers. In accordance 
with this arrangement the work was rapidly 
extended to all the eleven provinces of Holland. 
Thirty-five sewing classes, in as many different 
places, were established within a few months. 
Approximately 4,000 women worked in these 
sewing and knitting classes. For each group of 
100 workers a supervisor was employed, who 
received a bonus running from $2.80 to $3.60 
per week. A bonus of about forty cents a week 
was paid to each worker. In order to earn this 
bonus the workers were required to work six 
hours a day six days a week. During the five 
months of operation the classes produced ap- 
proximately 100,700 pieces of underwear, 
28,000 pairs of socks and about 26,000 miscel- 
laneous garments. 
In establishing sewing and knitting classes for 
 
-P-A-G-E-281
      SEWING AND KNITTING BY REFUGEES 281 
the Belgian refugees in Holland, the Commission 
kept constantly in mind the fact that nothing 
should be done to encourage the refugees to stay 
in Holland later than the earliest date on which 
it was practicable for them to return to Belgium. 
Unquestionably the work could have been 
greatly extended. Twenty thousand sewing and 
knitting workers could have been secured as 
easily as the 4,000 who were organized into 
classes. Shoe shops and clothing shops could 
have been established in the different camps to 
give employment to men. The Commission 
felt, however, that in the very success of the work 
lay its danger. Its continuance would have 
encouraged the Belgians to stay away from their 
country. With this belief in mind the Com- 
mission ordered the work to be brought to a 
close on June 5th. When the Commission an- 
nounced in April its intention of bringing the 
work to a close, the Netherlands Government 
arranged to take over the classes as part of its 
programme of relief. Upon the announcement 
of the intention of the Government, every 
attempt was made to facilitate the transfer. 
Purchasing and distributing arrangements had 
already been greatly simplified. Efforts were 
made to provide a greater variety of materials. 
The Commission purchased outright the 498 
sewing machines which were held under a lease 
and lent them to the Dutch Government for 
the continuance of the work.

Of this amount, 49 per cent was spent for

wages and bonuses. 
The work of the War Relief Commission in 
Holland was greatly simplified by the codper- 
ation of the Government. Both the Govern- 
ment Committee for the Relief of Belgians and 
the National Committee for the Relief of Bel- 
gians placed the facilities of their organizations 
at the disposal of the Rockefeller Foundation. 
Baron E. Van Tuyll Van Serooskerken was 
appointed as the official delegate and represen- 
tative of the Government and the two com- 
mittees to assist the Foundation in its work. 
CLOTHING FOR THE DESTITUTE IN BELGIUM AND 
NORTHERN FRANCE 
In the latter part of November, 1915, the 
Commission for Relief in Belgium announced 
that the problem of clothing the destitute people 
in Belgium and Northern France was rapidly 
becoming acute. Reports from their relief
-P-A-G-E-283
  DISTRIBUTION IN BELGIUM AND NORTHERN FRANCE 283 
depots indicated that the stocks of clothing in 
Belgium would probably be exhausted by the 
end of the year, while in Northern France the 
need was even more urgent, as practically no 
clothing had been distributed there. The Com- 
mission estimated that $4,000,000 worth of 
clothing would be required to meet the needs of 
the destitute in the two areas. The Rocke- 
feller Foundation was asked to make a contribu- 
tion toward the amount required. After care- 
fully considering the information submitted in 
support of the application, the Executive Com- 
mittee, on December 3d, appropriated $200,000 
to the Commission for Relief in Belgium “for 
the purchase of material for clothing, the same 
to be imported by the Commission into Belgium 
and there manufactured by Belgian labor.” 
While the members of the Executive Committee 
felt amply justified by the known facts in mak- 
ing this appropriation, they believed that any 
further aid to Belgium should be based upon a 
thorough study of the situation by a represen- 
tative of the Foundation. Accordingly, on De- 
cember 15, 1915, they appointed to act for them 
Mr. Frederic C. Walcott, a member of the firm 
of William P. Bonbright & Company, Bankers, 
of New York. Mr. Walcott was in France at 
the time of his appointment and undertook at 
once to make the desired investigation. It had 
not been completed at the end of the year.

STIPENDS FOR BELGIAN PROFESSORS 
The quarterly grant of $5,000 made by the 
Foundation to provide stipends for Belgian 
professors of scientific subjects who are refugees 
in England was continued throughout 1915. 
POLAND 
At a series of conferences held in Berlin in 
January, 1915, the conditions existing in that 
part of Russian Poland held by the German and 
Austrian armies of occupation were discussed 
with members of the War Relief Commission by 
German Government officials and others. 
Following the conferences, the War Relief 
Commission traversed the territory occupied by 
the German and Austro-Hungarian armies. 
Throughout the territory examined the Com- 
mission found all industries stopped and the 
people idle. Many of the towns had no oil for 
lighting and no coal for heating or cooking. In 
many places the people were living upon potatoes 
or upon small quantities of supplies given to them 
by the soldiers. It was estimated that about 
three millions of people in the occupied territory 
were facing famine. Everywhere the distress 
seemed more extreme than it had been at any 
time in Belgium and with far less resisting power 
on the part of the people. 
When the Commission returned to Berlin, and 
after discussions with representatives of the 
German and Austro-Hungarian governments
-P-A-G-E-285
  POLAND 285 
and the Spanish and American Ambassadors, an 
agreement covering the administration of relief 
in Poland was tentatively drafted. Following 
is a brief outline of the principal features of the 
plan: : 
1. It was proposed to create three groups of agencies: 
a. Committees to collect money with which to purchase 
and transport food. 
b. An International Commission for Relief in Poland, to 
serve as a neutral agency to purchase and distribute food 
supplies. 
c. Local relief committees in Polish cities and villages 
to distribute food to individuals and to establish a system 
of payment for food by all having sufficient means. 
2. The German and Austro-Hungarian governments 
were expected to agree: 
a. To requisition no food within the territory covered 
by the relief operations excepting in that actually occu- 
pied by their troops. 
b. To requisition no money in any part of the occupied 
territory. 
c. To furnish agents of the International Commission 
for Relief in Poland with passes and facilities enabling 
them to supervise the transportation and distribution of 
supplies and to satisfy themselves of the observance of the 
agreements regarding the requisition of food and money. 
d. To carry free of charge the personnel of the Commis- 
sion, their baggage, and all supplies to be distributed. 
e. To recognize only the Commission for Relief in Poland 
for the purpose of delivering supplies in Poland. 
f. To accept as final the decision of the Chairman of the 
Commission upon questions arising in connection with the 
work of the Commission. 
'g. To codperate with Poland in devising a method by 
 
-P-A-G-E-286
  286 WAR RELIEF COMMISSION 
which the resources and credit of the Polish people might 
be made available toward financing the work of relief. 
3. The War Relief Commission proposed, in the event 
of the adoption of the foregoing guarantees and plan of 
organization: 
a. To supply the administrative expenses of the Inter- 
national Commission. 
b. To endeavor to establish a channel through which 
food supplies might be imported from neutral countries 
under the governmental guarantees described above. 
c. To make such contributions to the relief funds as 
might be warranted by: 
1. The codperation and efficiency of the governments 
and committees mentioned in the agreement. 
2. The needs of the people in Poland. 
3. The means at the command of the War Relief Com- 
mission. 
This proposed agreement was considered by 
the Trustees of the Foundation at a meeting 
held March 2, 1915. It was decided that the 
Foundation could not assume the grave respon- 
sibility of forming and conducting an agency for 
relief in Poland, but if a satisfactory neutral 
agency were formed the Foundation would con- 
tribute $10,000 a month for twelve months for 
the administrative expenses of such an agency. 
Some weeks later, the Commission for Relief 
in Poland was organized substantially in ac- 
cordance with the plan which has been outlined. 
A number of attempts were made by officials of 
the Commission to purchase grain for use in 
Poland. Grain could have been purchased in
-P-A-G-E-287
  POLAND 287 
Russia, but it was impossible to arrange for its 
transport. For one reason and another vigorous 
efforts made in various other countries to secure 
an adequate supply of grain suitable for use by 
the Poles proved unsuccessful. Finally, in May, 
the members of the War Relief Commission were 
informed that the German Government had 
completed another inventory of her food supplies 
and had found that there was enough food in the 
country to support the population until the 
following November. This assurance had led 
the Government to the conclusion that enough 
food could be spared from the German supply 
to support German Poland until the new har- 
vest, in connection with such supplies as Poland 
herself might obtain. Following this announce- 
ment the Commission for Relief in Poland with- 
drew from any further attempt at that time to 
be of assistance in German Poland. A few weeks 
later the negotiations between the Austro- 
Hungarian Committee and the Commission for 
Relief in Poland were likewise discontinued. 
EAST OF THE FIGHTING LINE IN POLAND 
In examining into the general conditions 
existing in Eastern Poland, the War Relief Com- 
mission found that not fewer than 200,000 
destitute refugees had fled into Warsaw and that 
proportionate numbers had crowded into many 
other towns and villages. The widespread dis- 
tribution and general character of the exodus
-P-A-G-E-288
288 WAR RELIEF COMMISSION 
were indicated by the fact that the Central 
Citizens’ Committee, the largest relief agency 
operating in Warsaw and the surrounding terri- 
tory, had found it necessary to establish sub- 
sidiary committees in over five hundred different 
communities. 
The War Relief Commission reported that it 
would make only for waste and confusion to 
create new relief agencies for Eastern Poland. 
The Central Citizens’ Committee and the organ- 
ization in charge of relief for the Jews were well 
organized and fully accepted by all concerned. 
The Commission confined itself, therefore, to a 
report upon the relief agencies operating in the 
territory and upon the character and extent of 
the need. 
The information contained in this report was 
transmitted by the Foundation to the principal 
relief agencies in this country which were con- 
cerned in sending aid to Eastern Poland and 
Galicia. With this knowledge at their disposal 
the relief committees were aided in securing con- 
siderable sums of money from the American 
public for transmission to the proper organiza- 
tions in Russia and Eastern Poland. 
SERBIA 
In February, 1915, members of the War 
Relief Commission visited Serbia to inquire into 
the destitution reported in that country. During 
the progress of the war between Serbia and Aus-
-P-A-G-E-289
SERBIA 289 
tria~Hungary up to that time, the military forces 
of the latter had twice invaded northwestern 
Serbia and both times had been withdrawn 
across the border. ‘These successive invasions 
had wasted the land traversed by the contending 
armies, while the population had fled to the 
southward and found refuge among the towns 
and villages beyond the invaded territory. 
The members of the Commission learned that 
since the second withdrawal of the Austro- 
Hungarian forces many of the Serbians had 
returned to their destroyed homes, and were 
reported to be suffering from want of shelter, 
clothing and food. The refugees who remained 
in the scattered communities to which they had 
fled, when driven southward, had some sort of 
shelter, but in other particulars were in as much 
want as their neighbors who had returned to 
their homes. 
The’ difficulties of travel in Serbia were such 
that it would have required several weeks to 
enable the War Relief Commission to make a 
comprehensive first-hand investigation of the 
actual living conditions of the people. The 
aspect and conditions of places which the members 
of the Commission did see induced them to 
accept statements that were made that much 
need existed among many thousands of Serbians 
—probably 300,000 or more. Indeed such oppor- 
tunities as the Commission had to observe con- 
ditions prepared them to believe that the des-
-P-A-G-E-290
290 WAR RELIEF COMMISSION 
titution in Serbia was more extreme than that 
which they had found elsewhere. 
The Commission learned that the plight of the 
people was aggravated and complicated by the 
prevalence of epidemic disease among them, which 
they were apparently quite unable to control. 
At the time of the Commission’s visit, typhus, 
typhoid and recurrent fever were epidemic in 
Serbia, and smallpox and scarlet fever were 
present in some communities. Cholera was 
expected with the warmer weather of spring. 
It was evident that the three epidemic diseases 
were distributed throughout the country. All 
of them were found in the communities visited 
by the Commission and in all the larger hos- 
pitals. In mortality, typhus was far in the lead. 
It was impossible to obtain comprehensive or 
reliable statistics of the extent or virulence of 
the epidemics. One report indicated that in 
the military hospitals alone there were 33,000 
sick patients, of whom 11,000 were suffering 
from epidemic diseases. This report did not 
include the hospitals for non-combatants, the 
sick in homes or the sick among the Austrian 
prisoners. Estimates based on inadequate in- 
formation placed the total number of typhus 
cases in Serbia at 25,000 to 30,000, and while the 
figures could not be regarded as other than 
largely conjectural, it was feared that they could 
not be far in excess of the truth. Up to March, 
no serious effort had been made to check the 
 
-P-A-G-E-291
  TYPHUS IN SERBIA 291 
epidemic with the exception of the establishment 
of an isolation hospital at Skopje. 
Perhaps nothing more strikingly illustrated 
the universality of the typhus infection and the 
difficulty of escaping it than the inroads which 
it had made upon doctors and nurses. Nor- 
mally, Serbia has had not more than 400 phy- 
sicians, a very small number for a population of 
four and a half millions. During January and 
February 60 of these physicians died of typhus 
and during the stay in Serbia of the members of 
the War Relief Commission they were told daily 
of the death of others. 
Three medical groups had been sent to Serbia 
from the United States by the American Red 
Cross. Two of the groups were combined, with 
a total personnel of six doctors and twelve 
nurses, and were placed in charge of a hospital 
in the town of Djevdjeli containing 1,000 
patients. Three of the doctors and nine of the 
nurses contracted typhus. One doctor had died 
of the disease when the Commission was in 
Serbia and several nurses were very ill. 
A British Red Cross medical group of eighteen 
members was stationed at Skopje. Three died 
of typhus and all but three of the others were ill 
with the disease when the Commission was in 
that city. : 
This great mortality among the already in- 
adequate force of doctors was rapidly reducing 
the ability of Serbia to grapple with the epidemic
-P-A-G-E-292
  292 WAR RELIEF COMMISSION 
herself. More than half of the total number of 
doctors were with the army at the front, or in the 
military hospitals. Trained nurses, as they are 
known elsewhere, were unknown in Serbia, 
except as a few had been brought in by the 
medical groups from other countries. 
The conditions which have been described 
indicated to the members of the Commission 
that widespread as was the destitution reported 
to them, the greater and more urgent problem 
was that of controlling the epidemics. In fact, 
the problems of destitution and health were 
inextricably interwoven, and it was evident that 
no general measures for the relief of destitution 
could be effected until health conditions were 
radically bettered. On the other hand, a reduc- 
tion in the amount of sickness and death would 
inevitably lighten the burden of present and 
future destitution. 
Consideration of these facts, daily impressed 
more deeply upon the minds of the members of 
the Commission, led them to the conclusion 
that any help which the Foundation might be 
disposed to give in Serbia should first be devoted 
to the direction and support of a strong, system- 
atic fight upon the epidemics which were 
threatening to envelop the entire nation. 
Accordingly, on March 4th, the Commission 
sent a cablegram to the Foundation summariz- 
ing the facts regarding destitution and disease 
in Serbia, and stating that an expert organizer
-P-A-G-E-293
SANITARY COMMISSION TO SERBIA 293 
of sanitary relief could accomplish important 
results if adequately supported, but that he 
would have to import assistants and supplies 
for a large work. The Commission. stated fur- 
ther that sanitary work would have to include 
both soldiers and civilians, and requested to be 
advised on what scale, if at all, the Founda- 
tion was prepared to engage in relief under the 
conditions described. 
Recognizing the menace to the health, not 
only of the Serbian people, but of the whole 
world, presented by this terrible condition in 
Serbia, the Executive Committee of the Founda- 
tion instructed Mr. Wickliffe Rose to confer with 
the officers of the American Red Cross in Wash- 
ington and to ask whether the Red Cross would be 
willing, if financially aided by the Foundation, 
to send a Sanitary Commission to Serbia. This 
inquiry was considered by the Executive Com- 
mittee of the American Red Cross at a special 
meeting held on March 6th. The Committee 
decided to appropriate $25,000 for work in Serbia 
and agreed to disburse such funds as the Rocke- 
feller Foundation or any other agency might 
donate. Inquiry by the Red Cross brought a 
cable from the Serbian Government inviting the 
presence of an American Sanitary Commission 
which, the Red Cross was assured, would be 
fully empowered to institute vigorous measures 
to cope with the epidemic. 
The Executive Committee of the Foundation 
 
-P-A-G-E-294
  294 WAR RELIEF COMMISSION 
thereupon appropriated $25,000 for expenditure 
under the direction of the American Red Cross 
toward the support of the proposed Sanitary 
Commission. Immediately following the deci- 
sion by the Foundation and the American Red 
Cross to send a Sanitary Commission to Serbia, 
the work of organizing the Commission was 
energetically prosecuted. After careful inquiry 
as to the availability of a number of men whose 
names had been suggested for the work, the 
American Red Cross appointed Dr. Richard P. 
Strong, Director of the Harvard University 
School of Tropical Medicine, as Director of the 
Sanitary Commission. Dr. Strong started 
abroad on March 17th, ahead of his American 
associates, taking with him an initial supply of 
10,000 anti-cholera treatments. On April 3rd 
nine members of the Sanitary Commission 
left this country bound for Serbia. 
On May 15th, a large party of physicians and 
skilled sanjtarians, some of whom had worked 
under Surgeon General Gorgas in the Canal 
Zone, left for Serbia to join the Sanitary Com- 
mission. Others followed from time to time as 
Dr. Strong cabled for further assistance. There 
were forty-three members of the Commission 
in all. 
Upon learning that the Rockefeller Founda- 
tion and American Red Cross had decided to 
send a Sanitary Commission to Serbia, the 
members of the War Relief Commission pro- 
 
-P-A-G-E-295
  SANITARY COMMISSION TO SERBIA 295 
ceeded to London. They were informed there 
that thirty British physicians had been sent by 
the army to Serbia and had already reached 
their destination. In his visit to France, Mr. 
James, of the War Relief Commission, had 
learned that the French were planning to send 
too physicians. 
It was obvious to the War Relief Commission, 
first, that the help of all the countries furnishing 
aid would be none too great to cope with the 
Serbian situation; and, second, that unless a 
unified and codrdinated effort were made by all 
concerned, the work would be inadequately 
done, and friction would be reasonably certain. 
The members of the War Relief Commission 
thereupon bent their energies toward bringing 
about a mutual understanding and agreement 
among the three Serbian sanitary expeditions. 
A number of conferences were accordingly held 
for the purpose of working out a plan for united 
effort in Serbia. 
These conferences brought out the fact that 
five separate British agencies were at that time 
engaged in some form of relief work in Serbia, 
and that they were working entirely independ- 
ently of each other. The effort of the Founda- 
tion and American Red Cross to establish a 
close codrdination in the Serbian work led to 
the calling of a meeting of representatives of all 
the British societies. Mr. Bicknell, of the War 
Relief Commission, was present at this meeting 
   
-P-A-G-E-296
  296 WAR RELIEF COMMISSION 
by invitation. After long discussion, it was 
proposed that an Executive Committee of three 
members be formed, consisting of one represen- 
tative of the British group of societies working 
in Serbia, one representative of the French 
agencies in Serbia, and one representative of the 
American agencies. Mr. Bicknell accepted this 
arrangement on behalf of the Rockefeller 
Foundation and American Red Cross and 
announced that Dr. Richard P. Strong would be 
the American representative upon this execu- 
tive committee. 
Sir Ralph Paget, formerly British Minister to 
Serbia, was selected to represent the English 
societies on the Executive Committee and Dr. 
Jaubert was appointed as the French represen- 
tative. 
It was agreed that the committee should 
select its own chairman. It was also decided 
that Serbia should be divided into three sections, 
with each national group in charge of a section, 
but that the organization should be elastic so 
that changing conditions and emergencies might 
be met promptly, forces thrown into places where 
most needed, uniform methods and standards 
applied, and supplies equitably apportioned. 
Later a joint committee of English and Americans 
was formed in Paris to codperate with the French 
authorities, and to help in buying and forwarding 
supplies to Serbia as required. 
The agreement with the authorities controlling
-P-A-G-E-297
  SANITARY COMMISSION TO SERBIA 297 
the British and French medical units sent to 
Serbia, committing them to the principle of a 
central organization to direct the work in Serbia, 
was of the utmost importance. It gave marked 
impetus to Dr. Strong’s efforts, upon his arrival 
in Serbia early in April, to secure for the various 
commissions absolute authority in sanitary 
matters throughout Serbia. With the aid and 
consent of the Serbian government and with the 
codperation of the heads of the various Commis- 
sions, Dr. Strong succeeded in bringing about 
the organization of an International Serbian 
Sanitary Commission, consisting of the following 
persons: 
OFFICERS: 
President, H. R. H. The Crown Prince Alexander 
Vice-President, Sir Ralph Paget 
Medical Director, Dr. Richard P. Strong 
Mempers: 
The Chief Sanitary Officers of the Serbian Civil and 
Military Departments. 
A representative from the Serbian Parliament. 
The Chiefs of the British, French, Russian and American 
Sanitary Commissions. 
The regulations decided upon by this Commis- 
sion were immediately enforced through the 
Ministry of War and the Ministry of the Interior. 
The following extracts from Dr. Strong’s 
preliminary report describe the methods em- 
ployed by the various medical units, working 
under the direction of the International Sanitary 
 
-P-A-G-E-298
298, WAR RELIEF COMMISSION 
Commission, to stamp out the epidemics which 
were ravaging Serbia. 
“The country was divided, for sanitary purposes, into 
fourteen districts. ‘To seven of these districts the French, 
British and Russian physicians were assigned and to 
the remaining seven the American physicians and sani- 
tarians. A system for securing information regarding the 
occurrence of cases of typhus and other infectious diseases 
in each city and village throughout Serbia was established. 
“House to house inspection for the finding of cases of 
typhus in the cities, with the removal of the patients to 
hospitals and wards devoted to the care of typhus cases, 
disinfection of such individuals, disinfection of the other 
inmates of houses in which cases of typhus had been dis- 
covered, as well as of their clothes, and finally disinfection 
of the houses themselves, were also systematically begun. 
Quarantine of individuals who had been in contact with 
typhus cases was undertaken after disinfection of their 
persons and clothing. Inanumber of such instances they 
were cared for in tents * * * where houses were not avail- 
able as detention camps. In some instances the districts 
were so badly infected that it was necessary to evacuate 
them en masse and to destroy, by partially tearing down 
and by fire, the majority of the dwellings. Dispensaries 
were established in the different cities where the people 
were treated free of charge. These proved a great aid in 
the finding of infectious diseases. 
“As typhus is conveyed from man to man commonly by 
vermin (the bite of the body louse), bathing and disinfec- 
tion of very large numbers of people and immediate dis- 
infection of their clothing in a short period of time was an 
important problem in combating the disease. For this 
purpose, sanitary trains consisting each of three converted 
railroad cars were fitted up. One car contained a huge 
boiler which supplied the steam for disinfection of the
-P-A-G-E-299
SANITARY COMMISSION TO SERBIA 299 
clothing. In a second car fifteen shower baths were con- 
structed. A third car was converted into a huge autoclave 
(disinfector), into which steam could be turned under 
atmospheric pressure. In this manner the vermin were 
immediately destroyed and the clothes thoroughly disin- 
fected. 
“Large tents were erected beside the railroad sidings on 
which the cars were placed. The people were marched 
by the thousands to these tents, their hair was clipped, and 
a limited number undressed themselves, carried their 
clothes to the disinfecting car and then passed to the car 
containing the shower baths. After a thorough scrubbing 
with soap and water they were sprayed with petroleum as 
an extra precaution for destroying the vermin. They then 
received their disinfected clothing. In many instances in 
which the clothing was very badly soiled fresh clothing 
was supplied. 
“In the larger cities and in those situated away from 
the railway, disinfecting and bathing plants were estab- 
lished or constructed, and separate hours were arranged 
for bathing women and men in large numbers. 
“In many towns the clothes were disinfected by baking 
them in ovens, either specially constructed for this purpose 
or those which had been built previously for the baking of 
bricks, or other purposes. As all the hospitals were in- 
fected it was necessary to systematically disinfect these 
and the inmates. 
“The patients were first removed from a ward, which 
was then thoroughly disinfected. They were then given 
a thorough bath by being scrubbed with soap and water 
and disinfectants. They were given clean clothing and 
placed in the disinfected ward. Their old clothing was 
usually boiled. The wards were first disinfected by sul- 
phur fumigation to kill the vermin. Beds were then re- 
moved and disinfected, mattresses, sheets, etc., being dis- 
infected with steam or by boiling. Walls, ceilings and 
 
-P-A-G-E-300
  300 WAR RELIEF COMMISSION e 
floors were then scrubbed with solutions of bichloride of 
mercury or carbolic solutions. In many instances the 
interiors of hospitals were thoroughly whitewashed. Every 
precaution was taken to prevent infection among the per- 
sonnel of the Commission. A campaign of education of 
the people by the issuing of popular circulars describing 
the disease, its methods of transmission and prevention, 
was undertaken. : 
“As cholera had occurred in places along the border 
between Serbia and Austria it was deemed advisable to 
perform vaccination against this disease, and so vaccina- 
tion trains and parties were also established, which went 
about the country with the doctors and assistants, who 
inoculated thousands of people daily. Vaccination against 
cholera and typhoid fever was made compulsory in Serbia 
*#4%%***** So far, no cases of cholera have occurred 
in Serbia this year. 
“The water supply of many of the towns was also 
greatly improved and artesian wells were bored in a num- 
ber of instances where the water in the vicinity had been 
condemned as unsafe after it had been examined syste- 
matically in our laboratories. In fact, a systematic bac- 
teriological examination of local water supplies was one 
of the tasks which was undertaken by our laboratories. 
“An important problem in the reduction of the amount 
of typhoid fever and the prevention of cholera was the 
disposal of human excreta, and a large number of sanitary 
and flyproof latrines were constructed throughout the 
country, particularly about barracks, hospitals, etc. In 
many cases the cesspools became filled to overflowing and 
there was not a sufficient number of hydraulic pumps in 
Serbia to empty a quarter of them. The American Red 
Cross immediately supplied, upon my request, a large 
number of these pumps. The construction of filter beds 
for purification of sewage was also undertaken in a number 
of places, and the sanitary condition of some of the ceme-
-P-A-G-E-301
  EFFECTS OF SANITARY WORK 301 
teries, where from twenty to thirty people had been buried 
in numerous shallow pits and insufficiently covered with 
earth, was improved. The destruction of the breeding 
places of flies, in connection particularly with the spread 
of typhoid and cholera, and of mosquitoes, in connection 
with the spread of malaria in southern Serbia, was also 
undertaken.” 
In July, the members of the War Relief Commis- 
sion spent some ten days in Serbia endeavoring 
to find out how much destitution existed among 
the civil population of Serbia and Montenegro, 
and to ascertain the general conditions as to 
health and sanitation in the two countries as the 
result of the three months of work by the Inter- 
national Sanitary Commission. Montenegro had 
been included in the territory covered by the 
Sanitary Commission shortly after Dr. Strong 
commenced active work in Serbia. 
The Commission found that at that time the 
problem of destitution was to a very considerable 
extent, if not fully, being cared for by existing 
agencies. 
It was quite evident ‘to the members of the 
Commission from the moment of their arrival 
that the sanitary conditions were in vivid con- 
trast to those described in their first report. 
There seemed to be not the slightest fear among 
the people of the possibility or danger of con- 
tracting a dangerous disease. The government 
officials and the doctors all felt that the typhus 
epidemic was practically at an end. A consider-

able amount of sanitary work in the way of 
cleaning up remained, however, to be done. 
On August 12th the International Sanitary 
Commission officially declared the typhus epi- 
demic to be at an end. Early in September 
Dr. Strong recommended that the staff of the 
American section be reduced to twelve men on 
October ist, and that this staff be authorized 
to conduct general sanitary work in Serbia for six 
months from that date. The estimated cost of 
the work was $30,000. Dr. Strong’s recom- 
mendation was approved by the American Red 
Cross and the Rockefeller Foundation agreed 
to provide the amount needed to carry on the 
work for the period agreed upon. Accordingly, 
toward the end of September, the American 
Sanitary Commission, with the exception of the 
one unit authorized to continue sanitary work, 
brought its work to a close. 
The Rockefeller Foundation contributed 
$100,000 for work in Serbia. In the latter part 
of February, when the members of the War 
Relief Commission thought at first that money 
was needed chiefly to relieve destitution in 
Serbia, the Foundation, in response to their 
cabled request, placed $25,000 to their credit 
abroad to be spent in Serbia for such purposes as 
they might think best. As has been previously 
described in this report, further investigation 
convinced them that the paramount problem in 
Serbia was the control of epidemics, and resulted
-P-A-G-E-303
    DESTITUTION IN SERBIA 303 
in their recommendation that a Sanitary Com- 
mission be sent to Serbia. Upon learning that 
the Foundation had granted their request for 
$25,000 for Serbian relief, the members of the 
Commission gave $5,000 to Dr. Barrie of the 
English Red Cross to be applied in properly 
equipping for hospital purposes a building at 
Skopje which had been turned over to him by the 
Government to be used as an isolation hospital. 
Later, when the American Sanitary Commission 
was organized, the War Relief Commission turned 
over to Dr. Strong the $20,000 remaining at its 
disposal for Serbia. Subsequently amounts 
totaling $75,000 were remitted to the American 
Red Cross by the Foundation, as contributions 
toward the expenses of the Sanitary Commission. 
The sanitary work of the unit left in Serbia 
by Dr. Strong under the direction of Mr. Edward 
Stuart was abruptly interrupted early in October 
by the invasion of Serbia by the Central Powers. 
During October and November every effort was 
made to ascertain through Mr. Stuart and others 
the conditions in Serbia and among the refugees 
who had fled from the country. On November 
30th cablegrams from Mr. Stuart and Dr. 
Henry S. Forbes reported an extreme lack of 
food and clothing among the general population 
at Monastir and recommended that flour and 
clothing be sent via Salonica. The Foundation 
‘immediately contributed $5,000 to the American
-P-A-G-E-304
  304 WAR RELIEF COMMISSION 
Red Cross to be sent to Mr. Stuart for emergency 
relief work. 
The question of providing food and clothing 
was taken up energetically by the American 
Red Cross and 400 tons of supplies costing 
$50,000 were shipped on the steamer “Frixos,” 
which left for Pireus on January Ist. The 
Foundation contributed $30,000 toward the 
cost of these supplies.’ 
During December numerous reports were re- 
ceived from various relief organizations de- 
scribing terrible conditions in Serbia and among 
the refugees who had left the country. Every 
effort was made by these organizations to for- 
mulate a comprehensive plan for administering 
relief under the extremely difficult conditions 
then obtaining. 
FRANCE 
In November, 1914, and February, 1915, Mr. 
James, representing the War Relief Commission, 
visited France and acquainted himself with 
conditions in that country. Owing to the 
urgency of the needs of the non-combatant 
population in the other countries referred to 
in this report, and to the large amount of 
volunteer relief work being done by other 
agencies in France, it was thought advisable by 
1Qwing to the exigencies of the military situation the effective dis- 
tribution of this cargo was delayed and a considerable part of it 
eventually reached the interior of Serbia overland by way of Marseilles 
and Switzerland,
-P-A-G-E-305
  FRANCE 305 
the Foundation not to undertake active relief 
operations in France at that time. 
In the summary of war relief work undertaken 
by the Foundation during 1914, mention was 
made of an appropriation to enable Dr. Carrel 
to meet the urgent need for certain sera. Dr. 
Carrel was spending his vacation in France at 
the outbreak of the war. He immediately 
offered his services to the French Government. 
They were accepted and he was detailed to the 
military hospital at Lyons. The terrible con- 
dition of the wounded that came to the hospital 
at Lyons for treatment, convinced Dr. Carrel 
that his greatest usefulness would consist in a 
combination of research with military hospital 
service. To this end arrangements were made 
whereby he was provided with a military hos- 
pital at Compiégne near the front, with acces- 
sory pathological and chemical laboratories in 
which special facilities were offered for carrying 
out the surgical procedures in which Dr. Carrel 
was especially interested. Mr. James cabled to 
the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research 
advising that the French Government had made 
this arrangement with Dr. Carrel and recom- 
mending that the Institute give Dr. Carrel 
$2,500 for equipping laboratories and appro- 
priate $1,200 a month for six months for main- 
tenance. The Rockefeller Institute appropri- 
ated the amount recommended by Mr. James. 
Subsequently the Foundation appropriated
-P-A-G-E-306
  306 WAR RELIEF COMMISSION 
$20,000 to the Rockefeller Institute to cover the 
expenditures in connection with Dr. Carrel’s 
work and certain other small items. In Novem- 
ber the Foundation appropriated $5,000 addi- 
tional to the Rockefeller Institute to enable it 
to continue its support of Dr. Carrel’s work. 
As a result of Dr. Carrel’s work in collaboration 
with Dr. Henry D. Dakin significant contributions 
to the technique of treating infected wounds 
and of accelerating their recovery were made. 
ARMENIAN AND SYRIAN RELIEF 
As early as August, 1914, the distressing con- 
ditions existing throughout the Turkish Empire 
were brought to the attention of the Rockefeller 
Foundation. On December 14, 1914, the fol- 
lowing gentlemen met at the office of the 
Foundation to make representations concerning 
the need of relief: Hon. Oscar S. Straus; Dr. 
Arthur J. Brown and Dr. Stanley White, of the 
Presbyterian Mission Board; Dr. E. L. Smith, of 
the American Board of Commissioners for 
Foreign Missions; Professor Richard J. H. 
Gottheil; Dr. John R. Mott, and Rabbi Stephen 
S. Wise. 
Reports were cited as having come from the 
American Ambassador in Constantinople, from 
agents of the mission boards, and others, showing 
that great distress was beginning to prevail in 
different parts of the Turkish Empire on ac-
-P-A-G-E-307
  
ARMENIAN AND SYRIAN RELIEF 307 
count of the commandeering of money and 
supplies for the support of military operations. 
In May, 1915, a report from the Persian War 
Relief Fund stated that destitution was wide- 
spread among refugees in Northwestern Persia, 
and that the immediate pressing need was for 
funds with which to buy food. 
These and similar reports accumulating from 
many different sources over a period of several 
months caused the Executive Committee to 
determine upon sending a member of the War 
Relief Commission to Turkey to make a first- 
hand investigation of the situation on behalf of 
the Foundation. Accordingly Mr. Jeremiah 
Smith, Jr., a member of the law firm of Fish, 
Richardson, Herrick & Neave, of Boston, was 
appointed a member of the Commission and 
departed for Turkey early in June. Mr. Smith 
did not reach Constantinople until July 4th, and 
his report was not forwarded to the Foundation 
until August 8th. In the meantime conditions 
in Northwestern Persia were becoming acute. 
On July 20th the Persian War Relief Fund re- 
ported that it had been able to secure for relief in 
Persia only $40,000 of the $100,000 that was 
thought to be necessary in order to give fairly 
adequate relief, and requested the Foundation to 
aid it to meet the emergency. The Executive 
Committee believed that the situation was one 
calling upon the Foundation to act with some- 
thing less than that finality and detail of knowl- 
 
-P-A-G-E-308
    
308 WAR RELIEF COMMISSION 
edge which ordinarily would be desirable, and 
appropriated $20,000 to the Persian War Relief 
Fund. 
In August representatives of the American 
Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions 
transmitted to the Foundation a very full report 
upon the conditions and needs of the Christians 
in Turkey. The report of the War Relief Com- 
mission was expected daily at that time and it 
seemed best to the Executive Committee not to 
make any substantial contribution for Turkish 
relief until it had been received. An appro- 
priation of $10,000 was made, however, with the 
understanding that it would be disbursed by 
representatives in Turkey of the American 
Board acting in codperation with Ambassador 
Morgenthau. 
The report of the War Relief Commission re- 
garding conditions in Turkey was received 
toward the end of August. It verified sub- 
stantially the reports received during the year 
from other, sources, and recommended that any 
relief given should be in the form of money 
which should be placed for disbursement in the 
hands of the representatives of missionary 
boards in Turkey acting in codperation with the 
American Embassy. 
About October 1st, the American Ambassador 
in Constantinople sent, through the State De- 
partment, an appeal for additional funds for the 
relief of the Turkish Empire. In the opinion of
-P-A-G-E-309
ARMENIAN AND SYRIAN RELIEF 309 
Ambassador Morgenthau a fund of $100,000 was 
required to carry on effective measures of relief; 
and similar representations were made by the 
American Board of Commissioners for Foreign 
Missions. In the meantime, a national committee 
had been organized to receive subscriptions and 
the Department of State advised that contribu- 
tions be made through that committee. After a 
consideration of the situation existing at that 
time the Executive Committee of the Founda- 
tion appropriated $30,000 for Armenian relief. 
A few weeks later the principal Turkish and 
Persian relief agencies united, the combined or- 
ganization being called the American Committee 
for Armenian and Syrian Relief. In November 
this Committee reported that the need in North- 
western Persia had been greatly increased since 
the Foundation’s contribution in July, owing 
to the arrival in that section of 25,000 to 35,000 
Syrians who had fled from the mountains 
of Eastern Turkey down into the plains be- 
tween Urumia and Tabriz. The Committee 
asked for a contribution of $10,000 from the 
Foundation to be sent to Northwestern Persia, 
with a similar amount which had been raised 
by the Committee. The Executive Committee 
appropriated the amount requested. 
The question of further contributions for 
Armenian relief was held in abeyance pending a 
survey of the whole field of war relief work anda 
 
-P-A-G-E-310

determination of the relative urgency of the 
need in the various areas where aid was required. 
WORK AMONG PRISONERS OF WAR 
In June, Mr. John R. Mott of the Interna- 
tional Committee of Young Men’s Christian 
Associations brought to the attention of the 
Foundation the work which the Association had 
undertaken in the military prison camps through- 
out Europe. The method of work pursued by the 
Association was to erect buildings in as many as 
possible of these camps. The buildings had 
in them, as a rule, a large hall for lectures, 
meetings and entertainments and four or five 
smaller rooms for evening and day classes, as 
well as for library and committee purposes. 
After erecting a building in a camp, the Associa- 
tion organized a number of committees, the 
members of which were set to work interesting 
their comrades in the opportunities offered for 
study and recreation. The International Com- 
mittee stated that it cost about $2,000 to erect 
one of these buildings and run it for four months. 
An effort was being made to raise a fund of 
$250,000 to take advantage of the opportunities 
for work open to the Committee. The Founda- 
tion was asked to contribute $25,000 toward this 
fund, and this amount was appropriated by the 
Executive Committee.
-P-A-G-E-311
  HEADQUARTERS IN EUROPE 311 
HEADQUARTERS IN EUROPE 
It became apparent during the year that in 
order to accomplish the objects of the War 
Relief Commission satisfactorily it should be 
continued indefinitely in Europe. This was de- 
sirable for the purpose both of keeping in touch 
with the rapidly changing phases of the relief 
work already in progress and of anticipating 
new needs. Accordingly, soon after the close of 
the year Mr. Warwick Greene, late Director of 
Public Works in the Philippine Islands, was ap- 
pointed Director of the War Relief Commission, 
without limit of time, and his headquarters have 
been established at Berne. 
The activities of the Commission have neces- 
sitated constant codperation with the Depart- 
ment of State, with American diplomatic and 
consular officials abroad, with the representa- 
tives of many foreign governments, and with 
other relief agencies, as well as with a large num- 
ber of private individuals, to all of whom grate- 
ful acknowledgments are due for unfailing cour- 
tesy and helpfulness.

TREASURER’S REPORT 
New York, January 15, 1916. 
To the Members of The Rockefeller Foundation : 
Gentlemen: 
Herewith I send you a report of the financial operations 
of the Rockefeller Foundation and its subsidiary organi- 
zations for the fiscal year ending December 31, 1915. 
The income for the year was $4,183,084.19; the balance 
from the previous year, after adding sundry refunds, was 
$4,468,103.99, making a total of $8,651,188.18 available 
for disbursement. The sum of $3,642,180.36 was .dis- 
bursed, including $1,341,561.11 on account of Mr. Rocke- 
feller’s designations, leaving a balance of $5,009,007.82, 
divided as follows: 
Amount to credit of Mr. Rocke- 
feller’s Reservation.....:..)... $1,443,334. 24 
Balance payable on appropriations 1,819,937.85 
Amount available for appropriation 1,745,735.73 
The two latter figures do not take into account pledges 
to unaffiliated organizations which will require payments 
in future years, amounting to $744,800.00, as shown in 
Exhibit C, nor the Foundation’s guarantee of Mr. Rocke- 
feller’s designation of $1,452,125.11 for the Rockefeller 
Institute for Medical Research. The $744,800.00 is 
treated as a current liability. in the balance sheet, 
Exhibit A, thereby reducing the amount shown there as 
available for appropriation to $985,935.73. The $1,452,- 
125.11, however, is not included in the balance sheet. 
It should be noted that the income for the year does 
not include interest and dividends on bonds and stocks 
which had accrued on December 31, 1915, but which 
matured at later dates, while the accounts for previous 
year did include such accruals as of December 31. Be- 
cause of this change, income for the year was reduced by 
about $1,053,293.43.

  TREASURER’S REPORT 333, 
EXHIBIT M 
Following is a Statement of Various Transactions Relating 
to Invested Funds, Together with Tables of Pur- 
chases, Sales and Exchanges of Securities: 
On January 8, 1915, the Finance Committee authorized the 
exchange of $500,000.00 Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul Railway Co. 
Debenture 4s, costing 91.0625%, for $500,000.00 Refunding 414s of 
the same Company at 89. The apparent loss on the Debenture 
bonds has been added to the cost of the Refunding bonds, which 
are secured in the same manner as the others and return a higher 
interest yield. In the tables of purchases and sales, in this Exhibit, 
the sale price of the one and the purchase price of the other are given 
as 91.0625%. 
On February Ist, the International Mercantile Marine Co. failed 
to meet the interest payment due on that date on its issue of Inter- 
national Navigation Co. 5% bonds. The Company had already 
defaulted on its 444% bonds, and in April, at the request of the 
Trustee of the latter mortgage, a Receiver was appointed. The 
Foundation owns $1,305,000.00 of the Navigation Co. 5s and 
$3,692,000.00 of the Marine Co. 414s. The income thereon, amount- 
ing to $231,390.00, has, of course, been cut off. A reorganization 
will be effected by Protective Committees representing both issues, 
or by the Committees representing the preferred and common 
stocks of the Company. The business of the Company has been 
so large and profitable during the last eight months that it is prob- 
able that the reorganization will provide for the payment of both 
issues of bonds. 
During February, the $10,000.00 Colorado Industrial Co. First 
Mortgage 5% bonds, carried at 80% in the Laura S. Rockefeller Fund 
for the Baptist Home Society of the City of New York, were ex- 
changed, at the suggestion of the donor, for $10,000.00 Virginia- 
Carolina Chemical Co. First Mortgage 5s at 93%. This 
transaction increases the principal fund by $1,300.00. It is also 
shown in the table of securities bought, in this Exhibit. 
On February 15, 1915, Mr. John D. Rockefeller conveyed to the 
Foundation $12,000.00 par value Canada Southern Railway Con- 
solidated Mortgage 5% bonds, the income of which is to be paid 
to the Baptist Home for the Aged, of New York City, as long as the 
Foundation shall deem it wise. This is the second gift from Mr. 
Bocetellee for this object, making $37,000.00 of this issue of bonds 
in all. 
The Consolidated Gas Company Convertible 6% bonds, referred to 
in the table of securities bought, in this Exhibit, were purchased from 
the Company, which issued the privilege to stockholders to sub- 
scribe at par in the proportion of $1,000.00 in bonds to $4,000.00 
in stock. As the value of this privilege represented 10% of the 
par value of the bonds (equal to 214% of the par value of the stock), 
and as the exercise of the privilege left the market value of the 
stock impaired to that extent, the Finance Committee ruled that 
the bonds should be given a valuation of 110%, and the original 
valuation of the stock reduced by 24%. 
On March Ist, the Western Pacific Railway Company failed to  
-P-A-G-E-334
334 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
EXHIBIT M—Continued 
meet the interest due on its First Mortgage 5% bonds, of which the 
Foundation holds $4,039,000, thus curtailing income by $201,950.00 
ayear. A Protective Committee has been formed, of which Mr. 
Starr J. Murphy is a member. The bonds have been deposited 
with the Equitable Trust Co. as Depositary under an agreement 
dated May 1, 1915. 
As stated in the table of securities sold and redeemed, in this Ex- 
hibit, the Foundation has received from the Cleveland Trust Co. 
$123,868.00 on account of the Foundation’s interest in the assets of 
the Euclid Heights Realty Co., in liquidation, as represented by its 
ownership of $716,000.00 of the bonds of the Company. This 
payment, with those previously received, exceeds the valuation 
at which the bonds were taken by $121,870.28, which sum has been 
credited to Reserve. A further small distribution may be received 
later. The $76,148.00 in mortgages on Euclid Heights property 
in Cleveland, reported in the table of securities bought, in this 
a were received in part payment of the above. 
n July 1, 1915, the Sunday Creek Company defaulted on its 
Galibed Trust 5% bonds, of which the Foundation holds 
$81,000.00, thus curtailing income by $4,050.00 a year. 
On July” 1st, the Protective Committee for the St. Louis & San 
Francisco Refunding 4s purchased the yey 1, 1915, coupons of the 
$2,000,000.00 par value of these bonds held by the Foundation. 
The $40,000.00 received therefrom has been added to the suspense 
account in which the proceeds of the sales of July, 1914, and the 
January, 1915, coupons were placed, pending the readjustment 
of the Company’ s finances. 
On September Ist, the Missouri Pacific Ry. Company defaulted 
on its 40-year Collateral 4% bonds, of which the Foundation holds 
$2,198,000.00 par value, thus curtailing income by $87,920.00 a 
year. These Bonds have been deposited with the Bankers Trust 
Co. as Depositary under a Reorganization Plan dated July 1, 1915, 
which provides for the exchange of this issue for 5% Preferred 
Stock of the reorganized company. 
As of September 30th last, the Executors of the Estate of Mrs. 
Laura S. Rockefeller delivered to the Foundation securities having 
a value of $340,324.67, and accrued dividends amounting to $548.33, 
a total of $340,873.00. The securities are listed in Exhibit O. 
The Foundation has the following securities among its investments: 
451 Shares H. B. Claflin Company Common at 79.32 $35,774.92 
354 siafee Pope Manufacturing Co. Common i det 
: 1,416.00 
15. 4,200.00 
Both of these companies have been in process of liquidation for 
a year or more, and it now appears that their assets are not sufficient 
to cover the claims of their creditors. The shares, therefore, have 
no apparent value, and, by order of the Finance *Committee, the 
valuations at which they were taken have been charged against 
Reserve. They will hereafter be carried in the accounts without 
value, and will not appear in the Treasurer’s reports.

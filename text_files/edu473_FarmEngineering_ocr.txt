  AUTHORS’ PREFACE 
The authors of this book believe that if changes in practice 
are to be accomplished, the explanation of principles must be 
accompanied by specific instruction in methods of doing things. 
Many men learn to perform useful tasks without learning 
principles or reasons; a few are able, from a knowledge of 
principles only, to work out practical methods of doing things. 
The teaching of practice from the standpoint of the doing of 
a job, accompanied and followed by the development of the 
principles and the reasons concerned, should result not only 
in a thorough knowledge of the proper method of doing the 
job, but also in a full and complete understanding of princi- 
ples and their application. 
Throughout this book the authors have attempted to teach 
the practice before stating the principles upon which it is 
based, rather than to teach abstract principles before any 
practice is given. 
In the present volume there have been gathered together 
certain mechanical jobs which a farmer should know how to 
do. These include many smaller or shorter jobs, such as 
those connected with harness repairing, soldering, rope work, 
and belt lacing, as well as certain larger jobs requiring a 
greater degree of judgment and managerial skill, such as 
concrete work, leveling and drainage, and the installation of 
water-supply and sewage-disposal systems. 
If certain of the jobs seem to be beyond the ability of the 
student, it should be borne in mind that this book is presented 
for the use of farmers and students in later life, as well as for 
those in school.

  vi AUTHORS’ PREFACE 
Although these groups of jobs may not seem to be logically 
related, yet in the life of the man on the farm the subject 
matter of Rural Engineering is not logically related but con- 
fronts him in varying order from day to day. 
The authors expect to prepare, in a similar manner, books 
dealing with gas engines and other farm equipment. 
In the preparation of this book, bulletins and unprinted 
manuscripts prepared by the authors, or by their co-workers 
in the Department of Rural Engineering at Cornell University, 
have been freely drawn upon. For permission to use this 
material and for many helpful suggestions and criticisms, the 
authors wish to express their appreciation to the following men: 
H. W. Riley, J. C. McCurdy, F. L. Fairbanks, J. E. Reyna, 
L. M. Roehl, A. M. Goodman, and N. D. Steve. The authors 
also want to thank Floyd Little for much help and many 
suggestions in connection with the chapter on Harness Repair- 
ing; George B. Lyon for his assistance and suggestions in pre- 
paring the chapter on Soldering; and W. C. Harrington for his 
assistance and suggestions in the preparation of the chapter on 
Concrete Work. 
The authors also desire to express their appreciation and 
thanks to the following persons, institutions, associations, and 
firms for their kindness in furnishing illustrations and other 
material for this textbook; G. A. Crabb; E. O. Fippin; W. W.

EDITORS’ INTRODUCTION 
From the passage of the Preemption Act in 1841 to the 
present time, the typical farm in the United States has been 
the ‘‘family farm.” The work is done by the operator and his 
family with the aid of some regular or seasonal help. To 
operate such farms successfully requires a diversity of ability. 
The farmer must be a “mechanic, laborer, scientist and business 
man.” The varying abilities implied in this quotation from 
Dr. G. F. Warren find expression in at least three types of 
activity in farming occupations: (1) working with productive 
enterprises, such as producing market milk, raising corn, wheat 
or cotton, or growing potatoes; (2) conducting management 
enterprises, such as planning for and securing the needed capital, 
laying out the farm, planning rotations, keeping cost accounts 
and analyzing the farm business; and (3) doing such repair and 
construction work and making such adjustments as may be 
encountered during the season-round conduct of the productive 
and management enterprises. Under this last classification 
are included such jobs as filing a saw, building a hay rack, 
sharpening mower knives, repairing and cleaning harness, 
splicing rope and making halters, installing running water in 
the kitchen or stable, laying concrete, draining a wet spot, 
soldering, painting, and operating, repairing and adjusting 
gas engines and tractors and other farm equipment. 
The present volume is one of a series dealing with con- 
struction and repair jobs, and with the adjustment, care and 
use of power and other equipment on the farm. This volume 
deals with mechanical jobs other than those encountered in 
handling gas engines, tractors, and other equipment, and in 
vu  
-P-A-G-E-8
viii EDITORS’ INTRODUCTION 
handling woodworking tools in repair and construction work. 
The authors are preparing additional volumes dealing with 
gas engines, tractors and other farm equipment. 
In the preparation of this book, the authors have made a 
careful survey and subsequent analysis of the activities of a 
large number of farmers, in order to determine the specific 
requirements for performing the construction and repair work 
indicated above as included in this volume. As a result of this 
study, the material has been organized to meet the needs of 
students as well as practicing farmers, as is graphically shown 
in the Table of Contents. In each chapter are included certain 
job groups, which serve to indicate the nature of the directions 
and explanations included under each caption. The statement, 
of each job indicates that a piece of work is to be “done.” In 
order that the student or the farmer may do this work effect- 
ively, simple and explicit directions are given for performing 
each job. But the worker must possess something beyond the 
mere skill acquired by following directions and by repetition. 
He must be able, by virtue of his knowledge of a particular job, 
to adapt his practices to changing conditions. To be resource- 
ful, he must possess certain technical and scientific knowledge 
in regard to the several jobs. Therefore, in each chapter a 
section is devoted to ‘general information,”’ in which is included 
a brief statement of the salient technical and scientific facts, 
principles and reasons which underlie the successful and intelli- 
gent performance of the jobs. 
The content is so organized that students or farmers may 
readily adapt it to the needs of the home farm. From the 
standpoint of the teacher, it is so organized that it may be 
correlated readily with the instruction in any unit offered in 
the curriculum. The editors have not intended that the con- 
tent shall constitute a separate course in mechanics, but rather 
that the suggestions and instructions given in the several jobs 
shall constitute a working plan on the basis of which the con- 
struction and repair problems of the home farm may be met. 
Teachers should keep in mind that this type of work has, as its
-P-A-G-E-9
EDITORS’ INTRODUCTION ix 
chief function, the enhancement of the income from the farm 
asa whole. The farmer must not be a “tinkerer.” He must, 
however, possess the mechanical abilities which will enable him 
to conduct the productive and management enterprises success- 
fully. 
The authors are well qualified, both from the standpoint 
of technical training and from that of practical and teaching 
experience, to prepare this series of books. Professor Behrends 
has served as a teacher of Agriculture in a high school depart- 
ment and for several years has been doing extension work in 
Rural Engineering at Cornell University, while Professor Robb 
has taught Farm Mechanics at Cornell University for fourteen 
years. The authors’ wide experience in conducting extension 
schools and short unit courses in Mechanics work throughout 
New York State, supplemented by a systematic survey and 
analysis of mechanical abilities needed by farmers, has served 
to further qualify them to make the present contribution. 
Both the editors and the authors will be glad to receive 
suggestions and criticisms which will lead to the improvement 
of this volume.

-P-A-G-E-20
  2 HARNESS REPAIRING 
1. Measure.—For harness stitching use No. 10 linen thread. 
Grasping the end of the thread with the thumb and first finger 
of the right hand and allowing it to pass between the thumb 
  and first finger of the left hand, draw out about 6 inches more 
than the length required for the work to be done. A thread 
5 feet in length can be easily handled. If considerable stitching 
is to be done, several threads should be made. 
  Fig. 3.—Tearing the Untwisted Linen Thread. Showing the long, slim, 
tapering point that should result. 
2. Tear.—Now tear the thread in such a way that a long, 
tapering end will result. To do this, continue to hold the 
thread between the thumb and first finger of the left hand, and 
bring the left hand close to the right thigh, laying the thread 
 
-P-A-G-E-21
  MAKING A WAXED THREAD 3 
over the right thigh. Untwist the thread by rolling it, under 
the palm of the right hand, away from the body two or three 
times (Fig. 2) until the twist has been removed to such an extent 
that the thread may be pulled apart with very little effort 
(Fig. 3). If the twist has been properly removed, the ends 
of the torn thread will be long and tapering. Cutting or break- 
ing a linen thread will leave the ends too blunt for making a 
waxed harness thread. 
Repeat this process, being careful to get all threads the same 
length, until enough linen threads are obtained to make a 
harness thread of sufficient strength for the work to be done. 
The number of linen threads needed will vary from three, 
for light stitching on reins, hame straps, 
and the like, to six or seven, for heavy 
work on hame tugs, traces, and other 
such pieces. 
3. Assemble.— When the waxed 
harness thread is finished, it should 
have a long, slim, tapering point which 
will easily pass through the eye of a 
needle and which will not be thicker 
than the needle when bent back and 
twisted into the thread. When attach- 
ing a bristle it is just as essential that 
the ends of the harness thread be long

when assembling the linen threads by

The linen threads are now ready to be made into a

near the stove or other heat so that the wax will melt on the 
leather. 
Place the assembled linen threads over a nail, drawing the 
ends toward you. Holding the threads about 6 inches from the 
ends with the thumb and first finger of the left hand, wax the 
ends. This is done by placing the ends on the waxed pad and 
the right thumb on the ends, drawing the pad off from the 
ends (Fig. 5). Three or four strokes should be sufficient to 
thoroughly wax the ends.

downward stroke of the right hand, hold the thread between 
the thumb and first finger of the left hand so that the threads 
will not untwist while the right hand is being brought into 
position for the next stroke. Now equalize the twist in each 
half of the threads by drawing the twisted threads back and 
forth several times over the nail. 
6. Wax threads.—Place one end of the twisted thread over 
the first finger of the left hand and wind the thread once or 
twice around the finger. Do the same with the other end on 
the second finger of the left hand. This protects the ends 
when waxing the thread. Holding the ends as described, and

the waxed pad in the right hand, apply the wax to the twisted 
threads. This is accomplished by placing the thread on the 
waxed pad and the thumb on the thread and then moving the 
pad back and forth vigorously over a short strip of the 
thread. 
Continue using the pad until the entire thread is well waxed 
and then rub the thread vigorously between the thumb and 
first finger of the right hand. This will still further melt the 
wax into the thread and will smooth the wax. 
7. Thread needles.—Draw one tapered end of the thread 
through the eye of the 
needle for a distance 
of 2 or 3 inches and 
bend it back against 
the thread. Holding 
the doubled thread near

Tools and equipment: 
Leather strap, try square, knife, plane, awl, stitching clamp, waxed 
thread, pricking wheel, finishing wheel. 
1. Prepare the ends.—Cut the ends of the strap off square. 
Place one end that is to be spliced near the edge of a wood 
block or a board on a bench, and, with a knife or a plane, 
bevel the end for a distance of 2 or 3 inches, doing all the 
‘cutting from the flesh, or rough, side (Fig. 7). The hair, or 
smooth, side of the leather is much stronger than the flesh 
side and should not be cut away as this would materially lessen 
the strength of the splice. Bevel the other end in a like man- 
ner, again doing all the cutting from the flesh side. 
2. Mark for the stitches.—Place one beveled end on top 
of the other, being sure that the flesh side of each strap is up 
(Fig. 8). The ends

is on each side of the strap (Fig. 9). 
Make the second hole through the overlapping straps. 
Place the left needle in the hole; with the thumb and first 
finger of the right hand (Fig. 37, A)! draw it through about 
3 inches; then hook the hand over it and draw it about a foot. 
Pass the other needle through the upper corner of the hole, 
at the same time pulling back the left thread (Fig. 37, B).

about 1 foot. Draw both threads up tight. Pulling back the 
first thread at the time the second needle is passed through 
. the hole will prevent it from being pierced by the second needle. 
The following method of stitching is preferred by many. 
Place the left needle in the hole made by the awl and then place 
the right needle in the hole above the left needle. Pull the 
needles through and then, taking the threads in the hands, 
pull them up tight. After considerable practice it is possible, 
by either method, to do stitching without laying down the 
awl or dropping the needles between stitches.

the method of stitching is the same.

and bring one thread through from the rough to the smooth 
side. Continue the stitching as before. 
Some persons prefer to have the threads cross entirely on 
the single strap, as shown in Fig. 11, A, rather than as explained 
and shown in Fig. 11, B. This may be done by making one 
more stitch with the two threads through the single strap and 
then making the crossover as explained above. 
5. Tie the thread.—To finish the stitching, pass the left 
needle through the leather; then wind the right thread once 
or twice around the left needle (Fig. 12). Pass the right 
needle through the hole and then draw both threads tight 
as before. This winding will lock the threads in the leather. 
Make another small hole back on the splice at a point $ inch 
below the next to the last stitch, and pass the right thread 
through, draw it up tight, and cut off both threads close to 
the strap on the flesh side. 
The harness thread, where it crosses over, is subject to wear, 
and if it breaks and the stitching is not carefully and properly 
done, the stitches may come out for some distance and loosen 
the splice. If desired, a knot may be tied when the last stitch 
before crossing is made, 
and another knot may be 
tied when the first stitch 
on the other side of the 
strap is taken. For ad-

3. Tubular rivets—When tubular rivets are used, it. is 
necessary to use a comparatively inexpensive riveting machine, 
which forces the rivet through the strap and clinches the end 
down on the strap (Fig. 16). 
While a strap may be quickly spliced by the use of a Conway 
loop or by rivets, a splice made by either of these methods 
should be considered as temporary rather than permanent 
and should be replaced later by a stitched splice.

8. REPAIRING A TRACE 
The method of repairing a broken hame or trace will depend 
upon the location of the break and the repair parts which are 
available. Breaks may occur in four places: (1) at the cock- 
eye end, (2) at the hame end, (8) at the buckle holes, and 
(4) between the buckle holes and the cockeye. Repairs for 
each of these may be made as follows: 
(1) Broken at the cockeye end: 
(a) By a stitched splice. 
(6) By a Concord clip. 
(2) Broken at the hame end: 
(a) By a hame clip.  
-P-A-G-E-32

(3) Broken at the buckle holes: 
(a) By a stitched splice. 
(6) By two Concord clips and a trace square. 
(c) By two hame clips and a link. 
(4) Broken between the buckle holes and the cockeye: 
(a) By a stitched splice. 
(b) By a trace splicer. 
Repairing a trace broken at the cockeye end, by a stitched 
splice: 
As a stitched splice is a rather difficult and tedious repair 
job and one which the average farmer would hardly undertake, 
the method of making it will not be covered in detail. It 
necessitates the insertion of a length of extra strap and two 
stitched splices. In order that the trace when repaired may 
not be bulkier than necessary, one end of the new strap is 
spliced to the trace near the cockeye, then inserted through the 
cockeye end, carried back beyond the first splice, and spliced 
to the trace. 
Repairing a trace broken at the cockeye end, by a Concord clip: 
Operations: 
1. Locate the holes. 
2. Punch the holes and assemble the parts. 
Tools and equipment: 
Knife, punch, rivets, Concord clip, try square. 
1. Locate the holes.—Cut the trace off square just back 
of the torn loop. Mark the holes for the rivets which are to 
pass through the Concord clip. This may be done best by 
inserting the end of the trace into the clip with the cockeye in 
position in the clip. This will assure the proper location of

holes so that the cockeye will be free to swing. In case the 
clip does not pinch the strap it should be made to do so in the 
following manner: Place the head of the Concord clip on some 
solid metal surface, and with a hammer strike the head of the 
clip, thus forcing the ends down until they pinch the strap. 
2. Punch the holes and assemble the parts.——Punch the

being sure that all parts are snugly together. Upset the 
other two rivets in a like manner. The use of a rivet set will 
improve the appearance of the work. 
Repairing a trace broken at the hame end: 
Because of the friction between the hame clip and the hame 
staple and the resulting wear on both staple and clip, it becomes 
necessary at times to renew the hame clip, or the hame staple, 
or both.

2. Locate and punch the holes for the rivets. 
3. Assemble the parts. 
Tools and equipment:

1. Remove the old clip.—File or cut off the clinched ends 
of the old rivets and drive them out. Using a file is usually 
easier than using a cold chisel. 
2. Locate and punch the holes for the rivets.—If the old 
rivet holes are badly worn, cut off a short piece from the tug.

8. Assemble the parts.—Slip the clip through the hame 
staple and place the tug between the two prongs of the clip 
(Fig. 18). It will probably be necessary to draw the two 
prongs of the clip close to the tug. This may be done by resting 
the ring end of the clip on a metal surface and striking the 
outer side of the ring with a hammer. Enter the rivets and 
rivet the ends.

Sometimes the tug begins to break across where one or the 
other of the rivet holes are located. With this condition the 
tug will soon break off. Under such conditions the two-hole 
clip should be removed and a three-hole clip installed. With 
an additional rivet, considerable strain will be taken from the 
old rivet holes where the tug was breaking.

2. Stitch.—Place the trace in a clamp and stitch as pre- 
viously described, using a heavy harness thread composed of

of repair is that a rather bulky splice is formed in the trace 
where it passes through the buckle. 
Repairing a trace broken at the buckle holes, by using two 
Concord clips and a trace square: 
As two Concord clips and the trace square are substituted 
for the buckle and the cutting off of the trace, an adjustment: 
for the length of the trace is no longer possible. To overcome 
this objection and to provide an adjustment, a heel chain 
must be attached. 
Operations: 
1. Prepare the ends. 
2. Assemble the parts and rivet. 
Tools and equipment:

a much more flexible joint, and is, therefore, considered prefer-

4. ATTACHING A SNAP OR A BUCKLE TO A STRAP 
It is often necessary to attach a buckle or a snap to a new 
strap, or to repair a strap from which a buckle or a snap has 
torn out. This may be done by any one of the following four 
methods: 
A. By a stitched loop. 
B. By a riveted loop. 
C. By a Conway loop. 
D. By a buckle-repair clip. 
A. By a stitched loop: 
The strap should be prepared as explained below and the 
stitching should be done as described on pages 6 to 10. Direc- 
tions for stitching in a loop are given on page 35. 
B. By a riveted loop: 
Operations: 
1. Prepare the strap. 
2. Assemble the parts and rivet. 
Tools and equipment: 
Strap, buckle, riveting machine, ready-made slide loop, tubular 
rivets, knife, punch, rule. 
1. Prepare the strap.—Cut the corners off the end of the 
strap as. shown in Fig. 25, A. Mark the first hole between 2} 
and 3 inches from the end of the strap. Mark another hole 
about 1 inch from the first hole. The distance between 
these holes should be such that the buckle is allowed a free 
movement. Punch the holes, using a punch of such a size 
that the slit in the leather will allow the buckle tongue free 
play.

Fig. 25, C, should extend back 3 or 4 inches from the buckle. 
It is well to insert an extra piece of leather in the bend of the 
strap to take the wear resulting from the buckle. Such a piece, 
when inserted, will add to the life of the strap (Fig. 25, Y).

5. REPAIRING A HAME 
. A. Renewing a hame staple. 
B. Renewing the lower hame clip. 
Because of the friction between the hame clip and the hame 
staple and the resulting wear on both the staple and the clip, 
it becomes necessary at times to renew the hame clip or the 
hame staple, or both. The lower hame clip and the hame loop 
are also subject to much wear and are, therefore, frequently 
in need of attention. The holdback plate and the line ring, 
while giving trouble at times, do not need nearly as much 
attention as do the lower hame clip and the hame loop. 
A. Renewing a hame staple: 
Operations: 
1. Remove the old staple. 
2. Place, hold and rivet the new staple. 
Tools and equipment: 
Cold chisel or vise, hammer, hame staple, washers, hack saw. 
1. Remove the old staple——Remove the old staple by filing 
or cutting off the riveted end and driving the staple out with a 
punch. The riveted end is often so sunken in the hame that 
the filing or cutting of the end becomes very difficult. Under 
such conditions, an easier and much quicker means of removing 
the old staple is as follows: 
Place one-half of the staple in the corner of a vise. Grasping 
the end of the hame (Fig. 29), move it back and forth until the 
staple breaks (Fig. 30). If the staple is broken this first step 
is unnecessary. 
With the hame staple in the vise as before, grasp the hame 
at the end and move it up and down. This will break the half 
of the staple off close to the hame and below the shoulder 
(Fig. 31).

the broken parts remaining in the hame may be driven out. 
If the staple is tapered, these broken parts may be driven out 
so far that the riveted ends can be cut off, and then these 
tapered parts can be driven back and out.

of the staple in the corner of a vise, and cut off the excess 
length, using a hack saw, a file, or snips. Place a washer over 
the end and rivet the staple securely (Fig. 32). Finish the 
other end in a similar manner. 
B. Renewing the lower hame clip: 
Tools and equipment: 
File, cold chisel, hammer, hack saw, rivets, hame clip, punch.

the end. With a file, or with a file and a hack saw, make a cut 
in the old iron just below the rivet head, and break the old 
iron off. Smooth the edges with a file after bending the end 
down against the new clip. 
C. Renewing a holdback plate or a line ring: 
To replace a holdback plate, the old hame staple must be 
removed and probably a new one placed in the hame, as de- 
scribed on page 26. 
The method of renewing a line ring is about the same as 
that used in renewing a hame staple. 
6. OVERHAULING AND CLEANING A HARNESS 
Operations: 
1. Soak the harness. 
2. Scrub the harness. 
3. Apply the oil. 
4. Allow harness to dry

Tools and equipment: 
Washtub, scrubbing 
board, scrubbing brush, 
harness oil or soap, warm 
water, sal soda. 
1. Soak the harness.

2. Scrub the harness.—As each part is removed, scrub it 
well and put it aside (Fig. 34). The work will be greatly 
facilitated if a serubbing board is used. This allows the dirty 
water to drain back into the tub. 
3. Apply the oil—While the harness is still wet, apply 
harness oil with a sponge or a cloth (Fig. 35). Rub the oil well 
into the leather. As the water dries out of the leather the 
harness oil will work in. As the parts of the harness are

32 HARNESS REPAIRING 
There are many different ways of making a hame strap, 
some of which are herein explained. The standard type, 
having a buckle and two slide loops, as shown in Fig. 36, 
B, C, or D, is the one best adapted for use at the top of the 
hames. When used at the lower end of the hames, however, 
the standard type of strap is sometimes troublesome because in 
tightening, the buckle frequently slides away from one hame 
end and jams against the other before the hames are sufficiently 
tightened. This difficulty is eliminated by the use of the 
Jones hame-strap attachment (Fig. 36, #) which includes with 
the buckle a metal hook that prevents the buckle from sliding 
and also shields the strap from wear. 
A. Using a Jones hame-strap attachment: 
Tools and equipment: 
Strap 20 inches long and 1 inch wide, knife, punch, copper rivets, 
hammer, one l-inch Jones hame-strap attachment. Try square. 
Use a strong strap about 1 inch in width and from 20 to 25 
inches in length. Give one end of the strap a slight taper and 
punch a series of holes for the buckle tongue. 
Cut the end of the strap off square (Fig. 36, Z), place the 
square end of the strap, flesh side down, on the flat side of the 
hame-strap attachment, and mark the two holes for the rivets. 
Punch the holes and assemble the parts. Enter the rivets 
from the smooth side of the strap and rivet the ends (Fig. 36, F). 
B. Using a union loop and buckle: 
To make a hame strap of the same length as above when 
using any of the following methods, a longer strap is necessary 
than when using a Jones hame-strap attachment, as the strap 
must be passed through the buckle and bent back for fastening. 
Tools and equipment: 
Strap 24 inches long and 1 inch wide, knife, punch, tubular rivets 
and machine or other rivets and a hammer, 1-inch union loop and 
buckle.

  34 HARNESS REPAIRING 
C. Using an ordinary buckle and two ready-made slide loops: 
Tools and equipment: 
Strap 24 inches long and 1 inch wide, two 1-inch slide loops, knife, 
punch, tubular rivets and machine or other rivets and a hammer, one 
1-inch buckle. 
A hame strap may be made with an ordinary buckle 
and two slide loops. These may be obtained in various 
widths. Bevel one end of the strap and punch a number 
of holes to take the buckle tongue. Cut a slit in the 
strap for the buckle tongue. Place the strap through one 
loop, then through the buckle. Bending the strap back, pass it 
through the other loop and rivet the strap, placing one rivet 
between the loops and one just beyond the loop farthest from 
the buckle (Fig. 36, C). 
D. By stitching: 
Tools and equipment: 
Strap 24 inches long and 1 inch wide, one 1-inch buckle, two short 
narrow pieces of leather, knife, punch, waxed end, pricking wheel 
or finishing wheel, stitching clamp, awl. 
A stitched hame strap may be made using any ordinary 
buckle and two short lengths of leather for loops (Fig. 36, A). 
Measure and mark the two short lengths, as explained, under 
“ Stitching a loop to a strap,”’ on page 35. Cut a slit for the 
buckle tongue and pass the strap through the buckle and 
bend it back. Slip both short pieces of leather between the 
straps until the mark on them is flush with the edge of the 
hame strap. Locate these so that the finished loops will be 
in the positions shown in Fig. 36, B. Place the work in a 
clamp and stitch the hame strap and the loops as described 
on page 37. Punch the necessary holes for the buckle tongue. 
The finished hame strap is shown in Fig. 36, B.

8. STITCHING A LOOP IN A STRAP 
Operations: 
1. Measure the leather for the loop. 
2. Mark and insert the loop leather. 
3. Stitch through one side of the loop. 
4. Stitch through the other side of the loop. 
Tools and equipment: 
Strip of leather for a loop, strap, waxed end, pricking wheel, 
or finishing wheel, awl, knife, stitching clamp. 
1. Measure the leather for the loop.—Use a strip of leather 
for the loop. Measure it for length by bending it around the 
strap or straps, and cut it off. When measuring for the length, 
be sure to allow for the strap or straps which are to enter the 
loop. 
2. Mark and insert the loop leather.—With the strip of 
leather which is to form the loop cut to proper length and in 
position around the strap, and with the ends together at the 
center of the long strap, make a mark across one end of the 
loop strap, about { inch inside the edge of the long strap. 
Notice the marks on the loop straps in Fig. 37, A. 
Insert the loop strap between the straps to which it is to be 
stitched, with the mark flush with the edge of the straps. 
3. Stitch through one side of the loop.—Place the work 
in a clamp (Fig. 37, A) and stitch this loop strap in as previously 
explained under stitching. After stitching one side, cross the 
threads over preparatory to stitching back. 
4. Stitching through the other side of the loop.—Before 
stitching back, bend the loop strap over the long strap and 
insert the end between the straps. 
If the end of the strap first inserted has been properly 
marked and properly inserted, the ends of the loop strap will 
butt together nearer the edge of the long strap where the 
stitching is plain. The loop strap is inserted as explained so

away from the per- 
son stitching, and 
coming out between 
the strap and the 
top of the loop. The 
awl pierces all of the 
straps except the top 
of the loop (Fig. 38, 
B). Make two or 
three stitches in this 
manner and then en-

gle, pointing toward 
the person stitching 
(Fig. 38, A). Stitch 
in this manner until 
the loop is passed.

a harness thread, and an awl (Fig. 42, A and B), stitching can 
be done. The spacing of the stitches can be approximated 
or marked with the 
aid of a ruler and an 
awl. The use of a

of a creasing tool (Fig. 42, D) and an edging tool (Fig. 42, Z) 
gives the work a still more finished appearance. 
A tool, used by harness makers for beveling the end of a 
strap and similar work is the skiving knife illustrated in Fig. 
43. To make the best use of this tool requires considerable 
practice. The same result may be accomplished by using an 
ordinary knife or a sharp plane. 
The draw gauge, although very useful in cutting straps 
of a uniform width from a side of leather, is not necessary 
when only a small amount of such work is to be done. A 
straight edge, if rigidly held and a knife will serve the same 
purpose as the draw gauge. The lignumvitae creaser is but 
another style of the same tool shown in Fig, 42, D.

CHAPTER II 
KNOTS, HITCHES AND SPLICES 
FINISHING THE END OF A ROPE 
Whipping.—Unlay one strand of the rope back a little 
more than one turn, to.a point where the whipping is to begin. 
Under this strand lay the twine, leaving the end (A) 8 or 10 
inches long, as shown in Fig. 53. Then relay the strand 
into the rope, keeping it tightly twisted and firmly held in place 
as directed for relaying. Let the short end (A) hang down the 
rope. Wind the long end (B) once around the rope, just above 
the short end (Fig. 54). Now lay end A along the rope toward 
the raw end and there bend it back, thus forming the open 
bight (Fig. 54, C). By so doing, a bight will be formed which 
can be pulled in under the whipping when tucking the ends. 
Although not necessary, it is best to lay the sides of the bight 
(C) in a groove of the rope. Wind the long end (B) around the 
rope and the doubled twine, being careful to pull it up tightly 
and to leave no vacant spaces between turns (Fig. 55). Con- 
tinue winding, or whipping, as far as desired; then pass the 
long end of the twine (Fig. 56, B) through the bight (Fig. 56, C) 
and pull it up firmly. By pulling on the free end (A) of the 
bight (C), draw the long end of the twine (B) downward, 
underneath the whipping, to about the center—not all the 
way through. Finish the whipping by cutting off both pro-

with twine in this manner, to:prevent it from untwisting, is 
called whipping. Ropes that are to be passed through pulley

the strand on the right (Fig. 58). Lay this strand to the 
left across the end of the rope and between the other two 
strands, leaving an open bight (A) projecting to the right, as 
shown in Fig. 58. Hold this bight vertical, as shown. Bring 
the rear strand (2) forward and down over 1, into the position 
shown in Fig. 59. Now take strand 3, bend it toward you, 
and carry it to the right and away from you, passing it over 
strand 2 and through the open bight formed by strand 1, as 
indicated by the arrow in Fig. 59 and as shown in Fig. 59. 
Form the crown by pulling all of 
the strands tightly, one after the 
other, until the knot appears as in 
Fig. 61. If the knot has been 
properly tied and formed, you will 
have, at the end of the rope, a 
solid, three-corned knot with all 
of the ends pointing back down the 
rope. 
Now proceed to splice back 
these loose ends. Each one should 
pass over the nearest strand of 
the main rope and under the one 
beyond, moving in a direction ‘ 
diagonally to the right, which is 4,, 61-—~The Crown Knot!

the strands of the rope. This ; 
process is known as tucking the strands. For this work, 
with large ropes, procure a smooth, hardwood stick, oblong 
in cross-section, pointed at one end, and rounded at the other, 
called a marlinesptke. 
To begin the tucking, select any loose strand. With 
your fingers or with the marlinespike, raise the second strand 
of the main rope to the right of the loose end to be tucked, 
and through the hole thus made pass the end of the loose 
strand, as indicated by the arrow in Fig. 62. Draw it down 
firmly. Now raise the strand of the main rope next and to the

right of the one just raised, and tuck under it the next right- 
hand loose strand. Then tuck the third strand under the 
next right-hand strand of the main rope. Draw all strands 
down securely. If the work has been properly done, between 
each two strands of the main rope a tucked strand will enter 
and one will emerge. 
Following the same process, the loose strands should each 
be given two or three more tucks, each strand receiving only 
one tuck at a time. As the strands are drawn down into

' place they tend to twist and kink. This tight twisting causes 
the tucked strand to stand out from the main rope and makes 
the splicing bulky. In order to prevent this, just before the 
strand is pulled into place untwist it at point A (Fig.63) and 
hold down about an inch of the loosened strand with the left 
thumb. Now draw down all of the strands not held by the 
thumb. A kink will form which must be drawn through, 
leaving the loosened strand that was held by the thumb to 
spread out in a thin band against the main rope. Each strand 
should be tucked at least twice before any tapering is begun.
-P-A-G-E-71
FINISHING THE END OF A ROPE 53 
Then by cutting out some of the material of each strand after 
each tuck, the splice may be neatly tapered into the main 
rope, as shown in Fig. 64. Do not cut the ends of the strands 
too close to the rope, as they are likely to draw back, with 
use, and become untucked. Wet the rope, and then, with a 
smooth round stick, pound the splice down solid, and roll it 
on the floor under the foot. 
When a slight enlargement of the end of the rope is not 
objectionable, crowning is a very neat, secure, and permanent 
method of fastening the strands of a rope. There are several 
other knots that may be used at the end of a rope to prevent 
its raveling. These knots should be used only when a distinct

enlargement is not objectionable, as it will be sufficiently 
large to prevent the rope from slipping through small openings. 
Overhand knot.—Make a loop of the rope, with the short 
end of the rope passing behind the long end. Pass the short 
end over the main rope and down through the loop (Fig. 65), 
and pull-the knot tight. 
The overhand knot is the simplest of all knots. The 
objection to it is that it will draw tight. Although occasionally 
used for finishing a rope end, the overhand knot is used mainly 
in connection with other knots and in making hitches and 
splices. 
Wall knot.—Unlay the rope three or four turns. Holding 
the rope in the left hand, with the loose strands up, take any 
strand as 1, lay it down and across the rope with the end

the thumb and the forefinger of the left hand, thus holding the 
knot in position, and pulling each strand separately up, away 
from the knot but parallel with the rope, as shown in Fig. 70. 
The knot should be crowded back against the twisted part of 
the rope. Cut the strands sufficiently long to insure their not 
pulling back. : 
When a small knob on the end of a rope is desirable, or 
when such a knob is not objectionable and a quick and secure 
method of fastening is needed, the wall knot may be used. 
Matthew Walker knot.—Unlay the rope about four turns. 
Holding the rupe in the left hand with the loose strands up, 
select the strand at the left as 1, lay it down and across the rope 
to the right, forming a bight (A) on the left. Hold this bight 
in place with the left thumb, as shown in Fig. 71. Take the 
next strand to the right, strand 2 (Fig. 71), and with it form a 
bight (Fig. 71, B) around strand 1 by passing it to the right 
around the end of strand 1 and up through the bight (A) 
formed by strand 1, as shown in Fig. 72. Now pass strand 3 
to the right around the end of strand 1—not across bight B— 
thus forming bight C, and then up through the bights A and B 
formed by strands 1 and 2 (Fig. 73). When passing strand 3 
up through bight A, be sure that it passes below strand 2. 
Next, form the knot by pulling all of the strands, one after 
the other at right angles to the rope. Finish the knot by 
grasping it between the thumb and forefinger of the left hand, 
thus holding the knot in position, and pulling each strand 
separately up away from the knot but parallel with the rope. 
Cut the strands sufficiently long to insure their not pulling back. 
The finished knot is shown in Fig. 74. 
When properly tied and drawn down, the Matthew Walker 
knot is a very secure fastening for the end of a rope. It is 
quickly tied and not likely to loosen.

Half hitch.—The half hitch shown in Fig. 75 is taken around 
the main rope. It consists merely of a loop around the rope, 
the free end being pinched between the rope and the object 
to which it is attached. 
This hitch may be taken 
around an object (Fig.

and is not very secure unless the pull on the rope is con- 
stant. 
Timber hitch.—Pass the rope around the timber, take a 
half hitch around the rope, and then pass the free end once 
more between the rope and the timber, as shown in Fig. 76. 
When it is desired to roll a log or to twist an object, the 
timber hitch is placed 
on the side opposite 
to the pull. This hitch 
forms a secure, tem- 
porary fastening which 
may be easily undone. 
It was devised for 
raising timbers or 
bunches of boards. 
Two half hitches.——Pass the rope around the object, and 
then make two half hitches around the rope, as shown in Fig. 78. 
If made as shown in Fig. 77 they will jam tightly, while if 
correctly made, as in Fig. 78, the hitches are easily loosened. 
Two half hitches make a secure fastening, provided they 
are well pulled down and set before being subjected to a 
load.

pass this bight through the loop as indicated 
by the arrow (Fig. 80). When the hitch is 
drawn up, a turn (Fig. 81, C) will be formed 
around the standing part (B) of the rope.

This method is useful whenever there is already a strain 
on the rope, asin mooring a boat or in tightening a tent rope. 
Clove hitch for tall objects, or for those over the end of 
which the hitch cannot be passed.—Make one turn around 
the object, as shown in Fig. 88, bringing the short end (A) 
under the main rope (B). With the end (A), make a second 
turn around the object, above the first turn (Fig. 89), thereby 
making a cross wrap over rope B at C. Pass end A under 
the cross wrap (D), as indicated by the arrow in Fig. 89, and 
by pulling, properly set the knot, as shown in Fig. 59. 
Another method, preferred by many, when using a clove 
hitch to fasten a horse to a pole, 
is as follows: After tying the 
clove hitch, with the short end, 
tie an additional half hitch 
around the pole, placing this 
half hitch over the clove hitch. 
A clove hitch so secured cannot 
be loosened by the animal. 
Scaffold hitch.—Lay the short 
end (A) of the rope over the top 
of the plank (Fig. 90) leaving 
enough hanging down to the left 
to tie to the long rope, as shown 
in Fig. 94. Wrap the long end 
(B) loosely twice around the 
plank, letting it hang down to 
the right, as shown in Fig. 90.

the long rope (B) by an overhand bowline (Fig. 157). Pull 
the bowline tight, at the same time adjusting the lengths of 
the two ropes so that they hold the plank level. Attach a 
second rope to the other end of the plank in the same way. 
The scaffold is now ready. 
Many occasions arise involving the need of a single-board 
scaffold, hung by a single rope at each end. To be safe, a 
scaffold of this kind must be so hung that it will not turn, 
and the scaffold hitch fulfills this need. 
Taut-line hitch—Take a piece of rope 2 or 8 feet long, 
depending on its size and on the size of the rope to which the 
hitch is to be made. Splice the two ends of the piece together, 
or tie them with a square knot, Hold this loop (Fig. 95, AB)

behind the taut rope (C), allowing about three-fourths of it to 
hang below the taut rope and one-fourth to project above, 
as shown in Fig. 95. Grasping this loop at A, take two or three 
turns around rope C, passing through loop B, as shown in 
Fig. 96. Now pull B forward and down, as shown in Fig. 97, 
so that it lies across the turns formed by A. If it is desired 
to attach a block and tackle to rope C, place the hook through 
loops A and B. The harder the pull on B, the more firmly it 
will bind on the turns formed by A, thus preventing their 
slipping. 
There are many occasions when it is necessary to attach a 
rope to another that is supporting a load and that therefore 
cannot be bent. For instance, if a strand breaks, a new rope 
must be attached to the rope above the break; or if, in hauling

order to support it temporarily and to allow the tackle to

  HITCHES 65 
shown in Fig. 99. Draw up the bight by pulling on the long 
end while holding the short end, and then slide the bight down 
into position (Fig. 100). A loop is thus formed around the 
shank of the hook with the free end (A) pressed against the 
hook by the tension in the main rope (B). 
Double Blackwall hitch—Form a bight (C)in the rope, 
placing the short end (A) in front of the standing part (B), 
as shown in Fig. 101. Bring the bight up around the hook, as 
shown in Fig. 102. Bring the free end (A) from the left, and 
lay it in the hook as indicated by the arrow (Fig. 91), so that 
it points to the right, as in Fig. 103. Now bring the long end 
(B) to the right around the back of the hook and lay it in the 
hook, across end A (Fig. 103). Note that the long end (B) crosses 
over the short end twice, once at the back and again in the 
hook. 
There are frequent occasions when it is necessary to attach 
a rope to a hook. A 
quick and secure tem- 
porary fastening is the 
single Blackwall hitch, 
which is simply a_ half 
hitch about the shank of 
the hook. The double

needful for reducing the rope to the 
required length (Fig. 106). Holding the 
first bight with the right hand, with

second bight, and with the right hand 
throw a half hitch of the rope over 
this bight by turning the right wrist, 
as indicated by the arrow in Fig. 108,

is desired to shorten the rope permanently, the ends may be 
passed through the first and the second bights, 
as shown in Fig. 110. 
The objection to the method shown in Fig. 
110 of making the sheepshank permanent is 
that frequently one end passes through a set 
of blocks and is attached to something, as, 
for example, to a hay fork. Under such 
conditions, it would entail much work to take 
this rope down for the purpose of slipping 
the end through the bight at the end of the 
sheepshank as shown in Fig. 110. As there 
is little strain on this bight, all of the. pull 
being taken by the half hitch around the 
bight, the sheepshank can be held in position 
by whipping or tying the bight to the standing 
part of the rope, as shown in Fig. 105. The 
clevis, or free end of the rope, being avail- 
able, may be secured as previously described 
(Fig. 110). 
Another very simple method for securing 
this end is to throw a half hitch around the 
bight with the long rope, thus forming a clove 
hitch about the bight (Figs. 86, 87). 
Still another means of accomplishing the 
same result is to form a bight in the long rope, 
slip this through the bight of the sheepshank, 
and then insert a toggle through the bight in 
the long rope. This is not as permanent as 
either of the previous methods. 
The sheepshank is used for shortening a 
rope. It can be made quickly and without 
access to the ends. After a sheepshank has 
been tied in a rope, the rope may be cut at the

as safely as if it were not cut. It is said that this fact is utilized 
by steeple climbers, who, before lowering themselves by ropes 
from the towers where they have been working, make a sheep- 
shank near the upper end of the rope, cut it as described above, 
lower themselves to the ground, and then loosen the sheepshank 
by shaking it, when the cut rope falls to the ground leaving 
only a short end up on the tower. 
Rope tackle.—Make a bight in the rope, and with another 
part of the main rope throw a half hitch over it, as described ee

Rope Tackle. 
for the sheepshank and as shown in Figs. 112and 113. Through 
the hanging loop thus formed, pass the lower end of the rope, 
as indicated by the arrow in Fig. 113. This gives the finished 
tackle shown in Fig. 114. 
If, for example, rope A (Fig. 114) comes over the top of a 
load of hay, and if the bight (C) is caught over the end of the 
reach or over some other convenient part of the wagon, by 
pulling on rope D we can cause the rope to pull on loop B, 
which will act as a tackle block and will greatly increase the 
pull on A. Both sides of the loop C must pull on the tackle

above; otherwise the half hitch will pull out. The rope slides 
and chafes badly at B and somewhat also at C and therefore 
this tackle should not’ be made up frequently in the same place 
in the rope. It is intended for emergency use only. The 
rope tackle is regularly used by farmers drawing bulk hay to 
market. End A is attached to the pole, loop C passes around 
the back axle, loop B is 6 feet from the ground at the rear of the 
load, and end D is made fast by a slippery half hitch (Fig. 81).

To make this tackle secure, rope A may be passed through

Carry end A up over the turns just made, and pass it through 
back of the standing part of rope B (Fig. 115). Carry it down, 
and form a half hitch by passing it through under itself, as

is made by laying the ends 
side by side and tying an 
overhand knot in them (Fig. 
120). This knot is usually soma — 
difficult to untie when once einer ere pulled tight. 1G. .—Doubled Overhand Knot. 
The doubled overhand knot is the simplest way of joining 
two ropes, and is the one used in the automatic binding attach-

hand knot see Fig. 65. 
Square knot.—Cross the ropes, placing the right under the

bend each rope back on itself, as shown in Fig. 121. Note that 
ropes A and B are on the same side of C. Wrap A around the 
other rope end, producing the knot shown in Fig. 122, A and 
B being still on the same side of C. . 
This, the most frequently used of all knots, is secure when 
set, and maybe untied without much difficulty. In making it, 
care should be taken not to make a granny knot instead. A 
square knot joining two ropes of unequal size is very apt to slip. 
Slippery square knot.—This knot, shown in Fig. 1238, is 
tied in a manner similar 
to that in which the 
square knot is tied except 
that when finishing it a 
bight of the left or of the 
right end is used instead of 
merely the straight end. By pulling the free end of the bight, 
the knot is easily untied. 
This knot is particularly useful in tying reef points on sails 
or for any other use where it must be quickly untied. 
Granny knot.—The granny knot is frequently tied by mis- 
take for a square knot. It tends to slip under strain, and is

very hard to untie when set. The point at which the granny 
knot begins to differ from the square knot is shown in Fig. 124: 
ropes A and B are not on the same side of C, as they should be 
in making a square knot, and when the knot is completed they 
are still wrong, as shown in Fig. 125. 
Surgeon’s knot.—The surgeon’s knot is a modified form of 
the square knot. In beginning this knot the left end is

wrapped twice around the other rope, instead of once as for 
the square knot. If now the rope is pulled tight, the extra 
twists tend to keep the knot 
from slipping while the second 
part of the tie is made. 
In using this. knot with 
smooth cord, as in tying bundles, 
after the first wraps have been 
taken and the cord drawn up firmly, it is necessary to kink 
the double twists into a bunch so as to jam them, by swinging 
the hands around in such a manner that the wrists cross Fia. 126.—Surgeon’s Knot.

while still pulling. The knot will then hold securely while 
the second part of the tie is being made and drawn up tightly 
(Fig. 126). 
Sheet bend, or weaver’s knot.—Cross the rope ends, the 
right one under the left, as in Fig. 
127. Holding the ends thus crossed, 
with the right hand pass the main 
part of the right rope from left to 
right to form a loop around its own 
end, and thus passing twice above 
the left rope, as indicated by the 
arrow in Fig. 127 and as shown in 
Fig. 128. Release the right rope, 
and with the right hand bend back the end of the left rope 
across the right rope and into the loop just formed, as indicated 
by the arrow in Fig. 128 and as shown in Fig. 129. Pull the

end well through. Then grasp the ropes as shown in Fig. 180, 
and draw the knot tight, as indicated by the arrows. 
This is a secure fastening, capable of being made with great 
rapidity and easily untied. It is universally used by weavers 
for tying threads and yarns.

arrow in Fig. 131 and as shown in Fig. 132. Pass the loose 
end (A) through the loop just formed in itself, as indicated by 
the arrow in Fig. 132. Grasp the loose end (A) in the left hand

and the right-hand rope in the right hand, and draw tight, 
around the bight, the overhand knot just formed. In the left 
hand, grasp the two sides of the original bight, and with the 
right hand pull the knot up tight by pulling on the right-hand 
rope. The finished knot is shown in Fig. 133. 
This knot was devised for tying together the ends of balls 
of binder twine for use on grain harvesters. It will be noticed 
that the loose ends shown in Fig. 133 are both pointing in the 
same direction, and would thus not interfere with the passage 
of the knot through the guides and needle openings of the 
harvester. 
Carrick bend.—Form a bight in the end of one of the ropes, 
placing the short end (A) back of the standing 
part of rope 1 (Fig. 134). Place the end of 
rope 2 back of the bight just formed in 
rope 1.. Carry end B of rope 2 over the 
standing part of rope 1 above the bight, and 
under end A, as shown in Fig. 135. Now carry 
end B over the bight in rope 1, and in so doing 
pass it under the standing part of rope 2, as 
indicated by the arrow in Fig. 135 and as shown 
in Fig. 1386. Pull the knot up tightly, as shown 
in Fig. 187. This is done by drawing on the 
ends A and B. 
The Carrick bend is probably the best knot 
for joining two heavy or stiff ropes, because 
the loops in ends A and B are interwoven in 
such a manner that neither can close so tightly 
as to cause, at the end of the loop, an ex-

  Fig. 138.—First Method. 
KNOTS FOR FORMING LOOPS 
Slip knot.—The slip knot, sometimes called a running knot, 
is the simplest slip loop possible. It may be made starting with 
either the position shown in Fig. 141 or that shown in Fig. 148, 
whichever is easier for the person tying the loop. When 
beginning as in Fig. 141, grasp the end of the rope in the left 
hand, and, bringing the right hand upward, pick up a bight 
of the rope on the wrist, as shown in Fig. 141. Bend the right 
wrist so that the palm of the hand is upward and the little 
finger touches the short end of the rope. Then rotate the wrist 
as shown by the upper arrow (Fig. 141). This will cross the 
sides of the bight and form a loop around the wrist, and at the

    78 KNOTS, HITCHES AND SPLICES 
same time it will bring the main rope between the thumb and 
the first finger, as shown in Fig. 142 and as indicated by the 
lower arrow in Fig. 141. Grasp the main rope and draw a 
bight up through the loop, as shown in Figs. 143 and 144. 
In starting with the position shown in Fig. 143, the end is 
held in the left hand, and the loop is formed by twirling the 
rope to the right between the thumb and the fingers of the 
~ right hand. 
Either method is easy, provided the end is held in the left 
hand at the beginning. 
Slip knot and half hitch.—Tie a slip knot as previously ex-

plained, being sure, however, that the knot is tied in the stand- 
ing part of the rope, thus leaving the short end free to slip 
through the knot (Fig. 145). This is unlike Fig. 144, as here the 
standing part is free to slip. Grasping the short end, form a 
half hitch around the standing part of the rope, as shown in 
Fig. 145. It should be noted that the short end first passes 
back of the standing part of the rope and is then tucked under 
itself (Fig. 145). When the loop is drawn up, the half hitch 
will jam against the slip knot, thus preventing the short end 
from passing further through the slip knot (Fig. 146). 
This knot may be used when a loop that is adjustable as to 
size is desired in a rope. The relative location of the half

hitch may be varied at will, resulting, of course, in an increase

short end across the ropes in front of the left hand, as indicated 
by the arrow in Fig. 147, thus forming a second bight below 
the left hand. Pass the right hand through this second bight, 
as in Fig. 148, and pull the rope back through it to forma third

bight, down through which the end of the rope is passed, as 
shown in Fig. 149. Pull the knot up tightly. 
There is a right way and a wrong way to leave this tie when 
hitching to a plain post which has no groove, ring, or crossbar 
to prevent the rope from slipping down. If the knot is twisted
-P-A-G-E-99
  KNOTS FOR FORMING LOOPS 81 
around to the right of the post, as in Fig. 149, a pull on the tie 
rope will draw the rope tightly about the post and will thus 
tend to prevent it from slipping down; if, on the other hand, 
the knot is at the left, as in Fig. 151, a pull will not tighten it, 
and it will slip down. 
Instead of finishing the halter knot by passing the loose 
end down through the third bight, as shown in Fig. 151, the loose 
end may be carried around and tucked under itself, thereby 
forming an overhand knot around the loop. So finished, it is 
impossible for a horse to work the knot loose. 
Bowline knot.—The bowline is the best knot known for 
forming a loop that will not slip under strain and that may be 
easily untied. The following methods are used in making the 
bowline knot: 
Overhand method.—Hold the standing part of the rope in the 
left hand and the free end in the 
right hand (Fig. 152). This knot 
can be tied in five steps as fol- 
lows: (1) Move the right hand 
forward and lay the loose end 
across the standing part of the 
rope above the left hand, as shown 
in Fig. 153; (2) move the left 
hand upward and forward over 
the right, as indicated by the 
arrow in Fig. 153, and just as the 
left hand is passing the right, turn 
the right hand palm up, which will 
result in the formation of a loop 
in the standing part of the rope Fic. 156. Fig. 157. 
with the end of the rope projecting Bowline Knot, Overhand 
up through it, as shown in Fig. 154; Meenoe Completed: 
(3) grasp the loose end in the right hand, and move it forward, 
as shown in Fig. 155; (4) pass the loose end around behind the 
long rope from right to left, as shown in Fig. 156; (5) pass 
the end down into the loop again from above, as indicated by 
 
-P-A-G-E-100
  82 KNOTS, HITCHES AND SPLICES 
the arrow in Fig. 156 and as shown in Fig. 157. Set the bow- 
line by grasping with one hand the two sides of the bight and 
with the other the standing part, being careful not to pull the 
bight down into the loop so far as to make it hard to untie nor 
. to leave it so far out of the loop as to leave the knot too loose. 
Note that this knot consists of a loop with a bight up through it, 
the bight passing around the standing part. 
This method of tying the bowline is to be used when standing 
opposite the free end of a slack rope. 
Underhand method.—Pass the rope through the eye or 
   :

around the object from left to right, holding the standing 
part of the rope in the left hand. By passing the free end first 
over the standing part of the rope, take a half hitch around 
it (Fig. 158). Now transfer the loop from the free end to the 
standing part of the rope, which is done by giving slack with 
the left hand and pulling up with the right, as indicated by the 
arrows in Fig. 158. With the loop transferred to the standing 
part of the rope and the end passing through it, as in Fig. 159, 
it is only necessary to pass the free end under the standing 
part of the rope from left to right, as indicated by the arrow 
in Fig. 159, and back over and through the loop from below,
-P-A-G-E-101
  KNOTS FOR FORMING LOOPS 83 
as shown in Fig. 160. The knot is now ready to be tightened, 
and then it is finished. 
The underhand method of tying the bowline is to be used 
when standing alongside of the rope and making a loop around 
some object or through an eye. 
Texas method.—Throw the rope over the horse’s neck or pass 
it through the bolt eye, as the case may be. Lay both hands 
side by side with the palms down on the standing part of the 
rope, as shown in Fig. 161. Rotate the right hand as if the

forearm were a long pivot, as indicated by the arrow in Fig. 161, 
and thus form a loop as in Fig. 162. With the left hand, push 
a bight of the standing part of the rope from left to right 
through this loop, as indicated by the arrow in Fig. 162 and as 
shown at B in Fig. 163. Reach under the horse’s neck, grasp 
the free end of the rope, and pass it upward through bight 
B, as indicated by the arrow in Fig. 163. Draw the end up 
until the loop about the horse’s neck is of the size desired, 
bend the rope end back on itself to form bight A (Fig. 164), 
and grasp both sides of the bight with the right hand as shown.
-P-A-G-E-102

Downward pulling on the standing part of the rope will 
straighten bight B and will force loop C up over bight A, as

indicated by the arrows in Fig. 164 and as shown in Fig. 165. 
  Fic. 166.—Run- 
ning Bowline. Continue pulling until the knot is firmly set. 
Like the underhand method, the Texas 
method is to be used when standing alongside 
of the rope; it is particularly useful in fasten- 
ing a tie rope about a horse’s neck, since the 
size of the loop is easily adjusted, as already 
explained. 
Running bowline.—This is simply a slip 
knot wherein the loop through which the rope 
slips is formed by using the bowline knot, as 
already described (Fig. 166). 
Water bowline——The first three steps in 
tying the water bowline knot are identical 
with those previously described for tying a 
bowline knot by the overhand method (Figs. 
152 and 153). After reaching the position 
shown in Fig. 154, proceed as follows to tie 
the water bowline: Again move the right hand forward, and 
again lay the free end across the standing part of the rope
-P-A-G-E-103
  
KNOTS FOR FORMING LOOPS 85 
above the first loop. Grasping the standing part of the rope 
above the first loop, again move the left hand forward as 
indicated by the arrow in Fig. 153, and again turn the right 
hand palm up, thus forming 
a second loop, above the 
first, around the free end, as 
shown in Fig. 167. Be sure 
that the two loops stand 
exactly as shown in Fig. 167. 
The knot is finished in the 
same manner as the bowline 
—namely, by carrying the 
free end back around the 
standing part of the rope and 
down through the two loops 
just formed, as indicated by 
the arrow in Fig. 167 and as 
shown in Fig. 168. This 
knot should be set in the 
same way as is the regular 
bowline, using care that the 
two loops are kept well 
apart, as shown in Fig. 
168. An examination of 
the knot will show that it 
consists of an ordinary bow- 
line with the addition of a half hitch. 
This knot is used whenever the rope in use is likely to become 
soaked with water. As the strain is taken by the additional 
half hitch, all chances of the bowline drawing so tight that 
it will be difficult to untie are climinated, provided. that the 
two loops are kept separated. It is very desirable to use this 
knot when harvesting ice. 
Double bowline with a bight.—The steps indicated in Figs. 
169 and 170 are the same as those described for Figs. 152, 153, 
and 154. After reaching the position shown in Fig. 170, 
  Fig. 167. Fra. 168.

-P-A-G-E-104
  86 KNOTS, HITCHES AND SPLICES 
however, the knot is made differently. Instead of bight A 
being passed around behind the standing part of the ropes, 
it is pulled up through the small loop near A and then brought 
downward, as indicated by the arrow in Fig. 170, and the 
whole of the large loop (B) is then passed through bight A. 
The bight is then brought back to its starting point of Fig. 170, 
  Fic. 169. Fia. 170. Fig. 171. 
Double Bowline with a Bight, First Method. 
and loop B is pulled out again. This brings bight A down 
into place and produces the finished knot shown in Fig. 171. 
Spanish bowline.—Form a bight in the rope, and fold the 
bight back at A (Fig. 172) and down against the standing 
part of the ropes at B, thus forming two loops. Cross the 
inner sides of the bight at A (Fig. 172). Grasp this crossing 
and fold it forward and down on to point B, thus forming two 
new smaller loops, as shown in Fig. 173. Pass the end of
-P-A-G-E-105
KNOTS FOR FORMING LOOPS 87 
each large loop back through the nearest small loop, as indi- 
cated by the arrows in Fig. 173. Pull these loops out hard, 
and the knot is finished (Fig. 174). 
This knot may be made in the middle of a long rope or in 
a bight at the end, and gives two single loops that may be thrown 
over two separate posts or both thrown over one. Either loop 
will hold without slipping, and the knot is easily untied. 
Neck loop for hitching—Tie a loose overhand knot in the 
standing part of the rope at the desired distance from the 
free end, as shown in Fig. 175. In the free end tie an overhand 
knot, and draw it tight. Slip the free end through the over-

hand knot in the main rope, and then draw this knot tight also 
(Fig. 176). The resulting loop will not slip. 
This tie is used for fastening horses or cattle. Its main 
value lies in the ease with which the loop can be adjusted to 
the size desired. 
Harness knot.—Start a slip knot by making a loop and 
drawing a bight up through it, as shown in Fig. 143, but pull 
the bight through only so far as is shown in Fig. 177. Now 
take the lower part of the loop, shown touching the left wrist in 
Fig. 177, and pass it between the bight and the side of the 
loop, as indicated by the arrow in Fig. 177, and as shown in 
Fig. 178. To pull the knot up tightly and have it keep its form, 
it is necessary to lay it on the right knee or on some other sur-

This knot is used by sailors for making loops in a towline. 
It does not weaken the rope very seriously, and is easily 
untied. 
Fisherman’s loop, or fisherman’s eye knot.—Form a long 
bight in the rope, as shown in Fig. 180. Then bring the 
end of the bight (A) forward and down on to the standing part 
of the rope (B), as indicated by the arrow in Fig. 180 and 
shown in Fig. 181, thus forming the two loops, C and D. Carry 
the upper end of the loop C to the left, placing it on top of loop 
D (Fig. 182). It will be noted that the two inside ropes form, 
between the right and the left hand, a figure eight. With the

right hand reach down through loops C and D and up through 
the lower loop of the figure eight, and grasp the rope as shown 
in Fig. 183. Pull the rope A, now held in the right hand, 
back through the loops, and the knot will be tied as shown in 
Fig. 184. This knot is made up of a slip knot with an over- 
hand knot tied in the loose end and around the standing part 
of the rope. When this knot is pulled up, the slip knot is 
locked by the overhand knot. 
Whenever it is desired to tie, in any part of the rope, a 
loop that will not slip, the fisherman’s loop may be used. 
This knot is sometimes used in securing guy ropes to posts 
or to stakes, but because it is likely to draw very tight it is

not usually as good for this purpose as the bowline with a 
bight. This knot is very good for forming a loop on gut leaders 
in fishing tackle, as it divides the strain equally between the 
two knots. 
Miller’s knot.—The open end of the bag should be gathered 
in the usual way and 
held between the 
thumb and first finger 
of the right hand, as 
shown in Fig. 185. 
Take a bag string in 
the left hand, and 
draw it across the top 
of the bag and under 
the last three fingers, 
but over the first finger, 
of the right hand, leaving end A but 3 or 4 inches long (Fig. 
185). With the left hand, bring the end of the string toward 
you, around the tuck of the bag, and place it under the heel 
of the right hand (Fig. 186). Hold end B by pressure of the 
right hand, while you 
let go of it with the 
left hand and reach in 
front of the right arm 
and grasp end B at the 
place just released. 
Continue to wrap end B 
(Fig. 187) around the 
tuck drawing it under 
the right hand but over 
the free end A and under the first finger of the right hand, as 
shown in Fig. 187. Pull the string taut. Now make another 
complete turn around the tuck, as shown in Fig. 188, pulling 
it taut. With the first finger of the right hand, draw end B 
under that part .of the string which was placed over the 
finger when the knot was started. Grasp an end of the string

and pull it backward out of the knot, thus untying the knot.

turns. Butt these

other end, as 
strand A is be- 
tween strands B

D and F, and so 
on. This process 
we may call lock-

of one rope to the corresponding strand of the other rope, as A 
and B in Fig. 192. Note particularly the way in which this 
knot is tied. The 
black strand just 
beyond the white 
one is the corre- 
sponding one for 
that white strand; 
as A corresponds 
to B, while D does 
not. The knots

GENERAL INFORMATION 
Kinds of rope.—Rope is made of hemp, of cotton, or of wire. 
Wire rope, being used very little by the farmer, will not be con- 
sidered here. Cotton rope is of value mainly by reason of its 
softness, and should be used in making rope haltets for young 
animals having tender skins. Because of its strength and 
durability hemp rope is universally used. Of late years the 
supply of true hemp has been insufficient to fill the demand, 
and a substitute has been found in the outer fibers of the leaves 
of a species of the banana plant grown in the Philippine Islands. 
The prepared fiber is exported from the city of Manila under 
the name of “ manila hemp,” the rope made from it being called 
manila rope. 
According to a pamphlet issued by the C. W. Hunt Com-
-P-A-G-E-125
  GENERAL INFORMATION 107 
pany, of New York, the process of manufacturing rope is as 
follows: 
In manufacturing rope the fibers are first spun into a 
“yarn,” this yarn being twisted in a direction called “right 
hand.’’ A number of yarns are then put together and twisted 
in the opposite direction, or “left hand,’ into a “strand.” 
Three of these strands for a three-strand, or four for a four- 
strand, rope are then twisted together, the twist being again 
in the “right hand” direction. When the strand is twisted 
it untwists each of the yarns, and when the three or four 
strands are twisted together into rope it untwists the strands 
but again twists up the yarns. It is this opposite twist that 
keeps the rope in its proper form. When a weight is hung 
on the end of a rope, the tendency is for the rope to untwist 
and become longer. In untwisting the rope, it will twist the 
threads up, and the weight will revolve until the strain of the 
untwisting strands just equals the strain of the yarns being 
twisted tighter. In making a rope it is impossible to make 
these strains exactly balance each other. It is this fact that 
makes it necessary to take out the “turns” in a new rope, 
that is, untwist it when it is at work. The amount of twist 
that should be put in the yarns has been ascertained approxi- 
mately by experience. 
In Figs. 226 and 227 are shown the end views of three-strand 
and four-strand ropes of the same size, a circle having been 
drawn about each in order that their solidness may be com- 
pared. In the three-strand rope the strands are larger than 
those in the four-strand rope, 
and yet the circle in Fig. 226 is 
not so well filled as is the circle 
in Fig. 227. From this may be 
inferred what is really the fact: 
that four-strand rope differs 
from three-strand rope in that 
the former is more pliable, 
has a more even surface, weighs more per foot, and being 
constructed on a core, the strands are kept away from the 
very center and therefore chafe one another less as the rope 
is bent around a pulley. The four-strand rope costs more per

pound, and there are fewer feet to the pound; nevertheless, 
it is a good investment if properly cared for. If absolutely 
necessary, a size slightly smaller than would be required in 
three-strand rope may be used, because of the greater strength 
and durability of the four-strand rope.

column V) is the greatest load that a single rope should be 
made to carry, and it is about one-seventh of the ‘“ breaking 
load,” or one-seventh of the pull in pounds required to break a 
rope of any given size. 
Size of pulleys.—When used for hoisting, as on a hay carrier 
or in a tackle, rope is continually bending and straightening 
as it goes around the pulleys. This bending causes the strands 
to chafe one another at the center of the rope. The smaller 
the pulley, the worse is the chafing. Therefore, in order to 
avoid serious wear on a hoisting rope from this cause, it should 
be run over a pulley of a diameter not less than eight times the 
diameter of the rope, as shown in Table 2, column VII. Thus, 
a hay car carrying a #-inch rope should have rope wheels 
6 inches in diameter, and for a 1-inch rope 8-inch wheels should 
be used; the wheels in the pulley blocks should be equally 
large or larger. In order to give economical service, rope used 
for transmitting power should be run over pulleys not smaller 
in diameter than forty times the diameter of the rope. 
As mentioned above, the chafing in a four-strand rope is less 
than that in a three-strand rope, and for this reason if small 
pulleys are absolutely necessary or are already on hand a four- 
strand rope should be used. 
Weakening effect of knots.—Knots weaken a rope because 
the rope is bent in order to form a knot and the outside fibers 
take most of the strain at the bend, with the result that they 
are overloaded and break; this throws the strain on the fibers 
below, which later break, and soon the entire rope is gone. 
The knot that weakens the rope least is the one requiring the 
least abrupt bending. Thus, in making a timber hitch (Fig. 76) 
the rope that carries the load is bent very gradually in passing 
around the timber, and is weakened but 35 per cent; while in 
making a weaver’s knot (Fig. 130) the bend in the loaded rope 
is abrupt, and the rope is weakened 50 per cent. The per- 
centage of strength left in a straight rope of any size, after 
any one of the knots mentioned has been tied in the rope, is 
shown in Table 3. The strength of the rope when tied in

* From experiments by Professor E. F. Miller, Massachusetts Institute of Tech- 
nology. 
Care of rope.—Rope should not be coiled when damp, and 
should be stored in a dry place. If a rope is wet, it should be 
laid in the sun until dry before being stored or coiled. A stiff and 
hard rope is very likely to give trouble, especially if run through 
pulleys. Such a rope may be made soft and pliable by placing 
it in a boiler or other suitable receptacle, covering it with water, 
and heating the water until it boils. After boiling, the rope 
should be stretched straight until dry. Boiling a rope decreases 
its strength somewhat. The excessive twisting of a rope may 
sometimes be remedied by drawing the rope about over the 
ground. The practice of tarring rope to protect it from the 
weather is of questionable value. It is claimed that the acid 
in the tar weakens the rope, with the result that a rope so treated 
is only two-thirds as strong as a clean new rope. 
Hand coiling and uncoiling—Because of the way in which 
» rope is twisted in its manufacture, it should usually be coiled 
to the right, that is, around “ with the sun,” or with the hands 
of a clock, as shown by the arrow in Fig. 228. If it is found 
that the rope tends to kink when being coiled to the right,
-P-A-G-E-129
  GENERAL INFORMATION 111 
then coil it to the left. The direction of coiling depends 
largely upon whether it is desired to put in or take out the 
twist-in the rope. 
Relaying an untwisted rope.—The process of building up a 
rope from strands is called lay- 
ing a rope, and so_ twisting 
together strands that have be- 
come untwisted is called relaying. 
The latter process is illus- 
trated in Fig. 229. Holding the 
rope in the left hand, twist 
strand 1 up tightly by turning 
the right hand as indicated by 
the arrow around the wrist. 
Then pull this strand down 
snugly into its place in the rope, 
and hold it there by pressing the 
left thumb on the point X. The rope should not be turned 
in the left hand. The next step is to grasp strand 2, pull it 
across the rope, twisting it tightly, just as strand 1 was 
twisted, and lay it snugly in place above 
strand 1, holding it in position with the 
left thumb by pressing on the point on 
strand 2 corresponding to point X on 
strand 1 and on the same side of the 
rope. The left thumb should not work 
around the rope, but should move 
straight up, always on the same side. 
Strand 3 is treated as was strand 2, and 
then strand 1 is again in position to be 
laid in above strand 3. This process is 
Fig. 229.—Re-laying, vepeated until the end of the rope is 
reached, and it should result in the return 
of the rope to its original condition, provided the strands 
themselves are not too badly untwisted; in the latter event 
it is better to cut off the rope than to try to relay it.

of the twist in the rope, always

  112 KNOTS, HITCHES AND SPLICES 
Principles of a knot.—“ The principle of a knot is that no 
two parts which would move in the same direction if the rope 
were to slip, should lay (sic) along side of and touching each 
other.” ! 
Another principle that should be added to the above is 
that a knot or a hitch must be so devised that the tight part 
of the rope bears on the free end in such a manner as to pinch 
and to hold it, in a knot, against another tight part of the rope, 
or in a hitch, against the object to which the rope is attached. 
This principle is well illustrated in the weaver’s knot (Fig. 
130) and in the half hitch (Fig. 75). 
Elements of a knot.—The bends that a rope undergoes in 
the formation of a knot or of a hitch are of three kinds: the 
bight, the loop, or turn, and the round turn. The bight 
a= CC Fig. 230.—Bight. Fia. 231.—Loop. Fig. 232.—Round Turn. 
(Fig. 230) is formed by simply bending the rope, keeping the 
sides parallel, the loop, or turn (Fig. 231) is made by crossing 
the sides of a bight; the round turn (Fig. 232) consists in the 
further bending of one side of a loop. 
Knots and hitches are made by combining these elements 
in different ways conforming to the principles of a knot given 
above. For example, the half hitch (Fig. 75) is a loop around 
a rope, with the free end locked under the rope; the clove hitch 
(Fig. 87) consists of two loops over a post; the sheepshank 
(Fig. 111) comprises two bights with a loop around each; 
the bowline knot (Fig. 157) is a loop with a bight through it 
and around the main rope; and the weaver’s knot (Fig. 180) 
is the same as the bowline knot, except that the ends take a 
somewhat different direction.

BELTS, PULLEYS AND SHAFTING 
1. BELTING A GASOLINE ENGINE TO AN ENSILAGE CUTTER 
The engine—10 horsepower: 
300 to 360 R.P.M=range of speed; 
20 inches by 10} inches=size of pulley. 
The ensilage cutter: 
3 to 6 tons per hour=rated capacity; 
650 to 800 R.P.M.=range of speed; 
6 to 10 horsepower = power required to operate; 
8 inches by 6 inches=size of pulley. 
It is desired to belt the above two machines together. 
Determine the following points: 
1. How fast must the engine run, using the pulleys supplied 
regularly, in order to operate the ensilage cutter at the 
required speed? 
. What type of belt should be used? 
. What width of belt should be used? 
. What length of belt should be used? 
. What type of lace should be put in? 
. Should the belt run open or crossed? Oo wr 
1. How fast must the engine run?—This means that it is 
desired to know the speed at which the engine pulley must 
rotate in order to drive the ensilage cutter at the desired 
speed.

In figuring pulley sizes the following rule is used: To find 
the unknown value (either speed or diameter) of a pulley, 
“multiply together the two values which are known about one 
pulley and divide this product by the known value of the other 
pulley.” 
  ” 
(x) The speed of engine pulley ES rem 
_ 6400

x=320 speed at which engine must run. 
As this rule does not take into consideration belt slippage, 
the engine should be run at a speed slightly greater than 320 
R.P.M. 
2. What type of belt should be used?—The advantages and 
disadvantages of canvas, rubber, and leather belts are discussed 
on page 155. It is suggested that prices of each be obtained 
locally. Such a job as this, because of exposure to weather 
and cost, is usually done with a canvas or rubber belt. 
3. What width of belt should be used?—The width of a 
belt in inches may be determined by the following rule: 
Multiply the horsepower to be transmitted by 12,000 and 
divide the result by the product of the number of plies of the 
belt, times the diameter of the pulley in inches, times the 
number of revolutions that the pulley makes per minute.

The letters in the above formula have the following mean- 
ings: 
W means width of belt in inches; 
12,000 is a number used in this formula, calculated from 
facts, determined by experience; 
HP. means horsepower to be transmitted; 
p means the number of plies of canvas or rubber belt.

4. What length of belt should be used?—Endless belts 
are usually used for such jobs as the one here considered.’ It 
should be remembered, when ordering, that from 3 to 5 feet 
will be used in making the splice, thus making the endless belt 
that much shorter. Distances between the source of power 
and the driven machine will vary from 20 to 75 feet, depending 
upon the type of power, type of work, and the amount of 
power transmitted. For tractors, belts of 100 to 150 feet are 
used; for engines between 8 and 15 horsepower, belts of from 
50 to 75 feet are used; and for engines under 8 horsepower, 
belts 40 feet long or less. 
5. What type of lace should be put in?—In this case the 
belt used would probably be endless and would be made so by

the manufacturer. For other conditions, when selecting a 
rawhide lace, the type of belt, the power to be transmitted, 
and the size of pulleys must be considered. The following 
suggested lacings are offered as a guide: 
(a) Leather belts (not heavily loaded) over fairly large pul- 
leys—single straight lace. 
(b) Leather belts (loaded) over fairly large pulleys—double 
straight lace. 
(c) Leather belts over small pulleys—single hinged lace. 
(d) Canvas or rubber belts over any size of pulley—single 
hinged lace. 
(e) Leather, canvas, or rubber belts (heavily loaded) over 
small pulleys—double hinged lace. 
6. Should the belt run open or crossed?—Sce page 158. 
2. INSTALLING A SMALL POWER PLANT 
There often arise situations where it is necessary to drive, 
from a single source of power, two or more machines, the driving 
pulleys of which may have to be of different diameters and 
possibly of different widths. To meet this problem a very 
common practice is to install, in suitable bearings, a length 
of line shafting on which is mounted the pulley through 
which the driving power is transmitted to the shaft and on 
which are mounted also the required number of suitable pulleys 
for driving the various machines. 
It is desired to install a small power plant and operate, 
from a 23 horsepower engine, a pump and other equipment. 
The engine runs at 500 R.P.M. and comes equipped with a 
5- by 54-inch pulley. The pump jack, geared 4 to 1, comes 
equipped with a set of 13- by 2-inch tight and loose pulleys. 
The pump is to operate at 40 strokes a minute. 
In this problem proper pulley sizes (page 149) and widths 
of belts (page 115) must be computed, the proper type of belt 
(page 155) and lacing (page 117) selected, and the kind and 
types of pulleys desired (page 150) decided upon. This part

of the problem will not be repeated since the procedure would 
be the same as under Problem 1. 
Operations: 
1. Determine the speed at which the shaft is to run. 
2. Select a shaft of proper size. 
3. Select a shaft of suitable length and also the necessary collars 
and couplings. 
4, Determine where the shaft is to be placed and select suitable 
bearing supports. 
5. Determine the proper spacing for the line-shaft supports. 
. Put up the line shaft. 
7. Line the engine up with the shaft. — 
Tools and equipment: 
Necessary shafting, hangers, collars, couplings, pulleys, etc. 
Brace and bit, rule, chalked line and chalk, plumb bob, lag screws, 
wrench. 
1. Determine the speed at which the shaft is to run—The 
faster line shafting is run (see Table 4) the greater is the horse- 
power that can be transmitted by the same sized shaft. The 
care and attention required with the higher speeds is, however, 
much greater. Because of the fact that line shafting, on farms, 
is not likely to be securely supported or regularly lubricated, 
a speed of more than 200 revolutions a minute is not 
recommended. 
2. Select a shaft of proper size.—For any given set of con- 
ditions the size of the shaft must be sufficient to insure that it 
will not be excessively twisted, and it must also be sufficiently 
rigid to prevent bending under the pull of the belts. In deter- 
mining the size of shaft, therefore, the factors to be considered 
are: the amount of power to be transmitted, the speed at 
which the shaft is to turn, and the distance apart of the bearings. 
For convenience, the following table is submitted as indi- 
cating good practice for average conditions:

8. Select ashaft of suitable length and also the necessary 
collars and couplings.—(a) Lengths—Shafts are usually fur- 
nished by the manufacturer in lengths varying from 14 to 20 
feet. Certain retailers supply shafting regularly in lengths as 
short as 4 feet. Great care must be exercised in handling 
shafting, to guard against its being sprung, as shafts even 
slightly out of true cannot be run at all at high speeds, are most 
unsatisfactory even at moderate speeds, and can be straight- 
ened only with great difficulty.
-P-A-G-E-138
120 BELTS, PULLEYS AND SHAFTING 
(b) Collars.—It is necessary to provide some means to pre- 
vent a line shaft from working endwise. This may be accom- 
plished by fastening securely to the shaft two special collars, 
one on either side of a bearing, or the hub of a pulley may be 
substituted for one of the collars. It is not necessary that 
both collars rub on the same bearing. The collar is held in 
position by a set screw, Fig. 233. Both solid or split collars 
(Fig. 233) are in use. It is important that the set screw does 
not project in such a way as to be capable of catching in cloth- 
ing, as serious accidents and loss of life have resulted from this

cause. Only collars with countersunk set screws should be 
used (Fig. 233). 
(c) Couplings—Where two lengths of shafting must be used, 
their ends may be joined by a coupling. Of the various types 
of couplings that might be obtained, one of the simplest is here 
illustrated (Fig. 234). It is a solid sleeve into which the set 
screws have been countersunk. The lengths of the line shaft 
are inserted in the coupling and are held in position by the two 
set screws. 
4. Determine where the shaft is to be placed and select 
suitable bearing supports.—Supports of the line shaft con- 
sist of the lubricated bearing, in which the shaft revolves and 
against which it rubs, and the supporting framework, by 
means of which the bearing proper is held in place from ceiling,

122 BELTS, PULLEYS AND SHAFTING 
wall, or floor. The exact location of the shafting is determined 
by the general layout of the machinery and also by the size of 
the largest pulley, as the shaft must, of course, be far enough 
from the nearest wall to give room for the pulley and thé belt 
on top of it, with a little clearance. 
Shafting supports which rest on top of a horizontal surface 
(Fig. 235; 1 to 6) are called rigid journal boxes, rigid pillow 
blocks, adjustable pillow blocks or floor stands, depending upon 
their construction, height and range of adjustability; those in- 
tended to attach to the side of a wall or post (Fig. 235; 7 and 8) 
are known as post blocks, post hangers, or bracket hangers; 
while those intended to hang downward from a ceiling or beam 
' (Fig. 235; 9 and 10) are called drop hangers. 
DESCRIPTION OF SHAFTING SUPPORTS 
Important features to be considered in selecting bearings 
and their supports are (1) convenience in erection and 
adjustment and (2) adequate means for lubrication when in 
use. 
In erection it will be found a great convenience to have the 
bearings split and the hangers so constructed that the shaft 
need not be passed through them endwise since with suitable 
equipment it will be found quite easy to erect all the bearings 
without the shaft and get them exactly aligned about a strong 
light cord stretched where the center of the shaft is to be. 
The bearings can be removed without changing the alignment 
adjustments, the shaft placed in the bearings and the entire 
assembly remounted in the bearing supports with the certainty 
that, if the first adjustments were correct the mounted shafting 
will be in perfect alignment. In Fig. 235 it will be noted that 
the rigid journal box, the post block and the ball bearing 
journal box are the only types from which the shaft cannot be 
removed sidewise. 
Two types of drop hangers are shown apart in Fig. 236, A 
and B. 
Referring to Fig. 236, A, it is seen that because of the
-P-A-G-E-141
INSTALLING A SMALL POWER PLANT 123 
elongated holes in the base of the hanger, a slight adjustment 
may be made by moving the entire hanger to the right or left. 
The two large screws, one of which supports the box and the 
other the cap, make possible a vertical adjustment. Both the 
box and the cap are babbitted and in the latter two oil wells and 
holes are provided. 
The hanger shown in Fig. 236 B contains all of the adjust- 
ments possible in the other hanger and an additional sidewise 
adjustment of the journal box. This is made possible by the 
  
  Fic. 236.—Two Types of Drop Hangers. 
two screws at the sides, as shown. Added features are an oil 
reservoir under the journal box to catch drippings of oil and 
also to facilitate the oiling of the journal box, and an oil wick 
in the bottom of the journal box through which oil travels up 
from the oil reservoir. Both the box and the cap are babbitted 
and the latter is provided with two oil holes. 
5. Determine the proper spacing for the line shaft sup- 
ports.—While the distance between supports for bearings 
varies with the diameter of the shafting, a simple rule generally 
followed is to place these bearings about 8 feet apart. For 
accurately locating these bearings, in millwrighting and similar
-P-A-G-E-142
  124 BELTS, PULLEYS AND SHAFTING 
work, the formula of the Pencoyd Iron Works (Kent) may be 
used: 
Distance between bearings V°140d 
when d=diameter of shafting. 
6. Put up the line shaft—(a) Locate and place the bearing 
supports. 
It is very essential that the line shaft and the shaft of the 
pulley on the engine be parallel. In all except a very few cases, 
either the engine or the line shaft may be located first. 
Assuming that the line shaft is to be installed first, proceed 
as follows: Measure out from the side of the building and 
locate the point on the ceiling which is to be above the center of 
the line shaft at one end. Measure out an equal distance from 
the wall at the other end of the line shaft and locate a second 
point. Snap a chalked line through these two points, space 
the hangers along this line about 8 feet apart. Measure out 
from this line on each side, the required distance, locate the 
holes for the hanger screws and bore the holes. Put up the 
hangers. 
(b) Adjust each bearing. 
Stretch a strong, light line tightly through the bearings. 
Support this line just beyond each end hanger. Be sure that it 
lies directly under the chalked line on the ceiling and at the 
proper distance below it. Make the necessary adjustments at 
each hanger so that the string passes through the center of each 
bearing. When making the vertical adjustment, hold a car- 
penter’s level up under the tight line to be sure that it is level. 
(c) Install the shaft. Put up the line shaft. Locate collars 
or pulleys (Fig. 223) so that the line shaft is held from moving 
endwise through the hanger bearings. Locate the main 
driven pulley which is to be belted to the source of power. 
7. Line the engine up with the shaft—(a) Draw on the 
floor the line xy directly below the line shaft. 
Having installed the line shaft, drop two perpendiculars to 
 
-P-A-G-E-143
  
INSTALLING A SMALL POWER PLANT 125 
the floor, using a plumb bob. The plumb bob line is hung over 
the side of the line shaft, near one end. A mark is then made 
on the floor directly under the point of the plumb bob y (Fig. 
237). Repeat the operation, near the other end of the line 
shaft. Snap a chalked line on the floor through these two

points. This line zy (Fig. 238) is directly below the side of 
the line shaft and parallel with it. 
Holding the plumb line in contact with one side of the 
driven pulley on the line shaft, and also just touching the side 
of the line shaft, drop a perpendicular to the floor. 
From this point measure over along line zy a distance equal
-P-A-G-E-144

to one-half the width of the driven pulley. This point A 
(Fig. 238) will now be directly haley the center of the face 
of the driven pulley. 
(b) Draw on the floor the line AG, perpendicular to the line 
XY at A. 
Draw a line on the floor through sheik A and perpendicular

to line XY. This is done as follows: Measure a distance AB 
to the right of A and a distance AC to the left. These dis- 
tances may be 3 or 4 feet or more, but AB and AC must be 
equal. Take a piece of light wire or string a foot or two longer 
than the distance AB. In one end tie a piece of chalk or pencil. 
With someone holding one end on B, draw the wire or string

tight and draw the ares M—M and O-O (Fig. 238). Now 
have the end held at C and, repeating the operation, draw the 
arcs N—N and P-P. On the floor snap a chalked line, passing 
through the intersections of these arcs. This line will pass

to Locating the Engine. Line «y is parallel with and directly below

through A and be perpendicular to both the chalk line CAB 
and the line shaft (Fig. 239). 
(c) Draw on the floor the line EF parallel to XY and at 
the required distance from it.
-P-A-G-E-146
128 BELTS, PULLEYS AND SHAFTING 
Having determined the location of the engine, now draw 
on the floor the line HF, parallel to line XY and at a distance 
from XY equal to the distance from the side of the engine 
crank shaft to the line XY. Locate the line HF by measuring 
out the proper distance from each end of the line XY and 
making the marks H and F. Snap a chalked line on the floor 
  Fig. 240.—Placing the Engine. The plumb line held over the pulley 
should fall on H, Fig. 239. 
through the points # and F (Fig. 239). This will intersect 
line AG, which is perpendicular to line XY at G. 
(d) Place the engine. 
A plumb line held over one side of the engine crank shaft, 
and at a position on the crank shaft directly below the center 
of the face of the pulley, should fall on point G. As sucha 
plumb line would be hard to drop, the desired result may be 
obtained as follows: Measure the diameter of the engine pulley,

take half this distance and measure this distance from point @ 
along the line AG. Place the engine so that the point of the 
  Fra. 241,—The Engine in Place and Belted to the Line Shaft. 
  plumb bob held on the center of the pulley face will fall on 
this point H (Figs. 239 and 240).
-P-A-G-E-148
130 BELTS, PULLEYS AND SHAFTING 
  Either check the other end of the crank shaft with a plumb 
bob, so as to place the crank shaft parallel with the line EF, 
or set the base of the engine parallel with the line AG. 
(e) Put on the belt. 
Put on the belt (Fig. 241). After running the engine it will 
be noted that the belt runs centered on each pulley. This is 
because the engine is now so placed with reference to the line 
shaft that the crank shaft of the engine is parallel with the 
line shaft; and the center of the face of the driver pulley and 
the center of the face of the driven pulleys are in alignment 
(Fig. 241). 
This procedure may seem elaborate, but after once perform- 
ing the operations listed, the setting of an engine to drive a line 
shaft and the setting of the other machines to be driven from the 
line shaft can be quickly done. The belts will run on and off 
the pulleys true, and there will be no undue strain on the 
bearings of the machines. 
If the engine is to be placed first, the operations listed will 
vary but little, the work progressing from a line on the floor 
parallel with the engine crank shaft. 
JOINTS IN BELTS 
It is necessary that the ends of all types of belts be joined 
in some manner when they are in use. If the joints are of a 
permanent nature the belts are termed endless. For leather 
belts, a permanent joint is obtained by beveling the ends and 
cementing them together. Rubber belts may be made endless 
in a somewhat similar manner, while canvas belts are usually 
lapped and stitched at the joint. 
Temporary joints may be made either with some type of 
metal lacing or a rawhide thong. The use of some of the 
types of metal lacing results in very rigid joints, while with 
others a flexible, hinged joint may be obtained. With raw- 
hide thongs it is possible to make two main kinds of laces, the 
straight and the hinged lace. The hinged lace, being much 
more flexible, is better adapted for use with canvas and rubber
-P-A-G-E-149
  
JOINING ENDS OF BELT WITH A RAWHIDE THONG 131 
belts and for all bests running over small pulleys. In general, 
with the hinged lace, a slightly longer rawhide thong is necessary. 
3. JOINING THE ENDS OF A BELT WITH A RAWHIDE THONG 
Operations: 
. Prepare the ends of the belt. 
. Lay off the holes. 
. Make the holes. 
. Put in the lace. 
. Secure the ends of the rawhide thong. ok 
wd 
Tools and equipment: 
Try square, knife, punch or awl, pliers, rawhide thong. 
The oldest and one of the best methods of lacing belts is by 
means of a rawhide thong. Through opposite pairs of holes 
punched in the belt ends, the rawhide lace is threaded in such a 
way that when the belt is in use the ends will be held firmly 
together and in line with each other, and the lace subjected 
to as little wear as possible. 
The mistake is often made of assuming that the heavier a 
lacing is made, the more durable it will be. A rawhide lacing 
should not be made so thick and clumsy that the belt is strained 
in going around pulleys. A lacing so made is liable to cause 
the lace to wear out in a short time. A good lacing is as similar 
in thickness as possible to the rest of the belt, so that it passes 
over the-pulleys without shock or jar. 
1. Prepare the ends of the belt—VFor all types of lacings 
the belt should be cut off, not by guess, but by the aid of a 
square. For straight lacings this is sufficient; but if a hinged 
lace is to be put in a leather belt, the upper and lower edges 
of the belt ends should be beveled. This will prevent the sharp 
edges from ‘cutting the lacing. 
2. Lay off the holes—The arrangement of the holes will 
depend upon the type of lacing desired and the width of the 
belt. The various types of lacings may be used on leather,

* Machinery’s Handbook, page 706. Many prefer, when lacing canvas or rubber 
belts, to locate the holes farther from the ends than indicated above (see Fig. 243).   
Having decided upon the type of lacing and the arrange- 
ment of the holes, lay them off accurately on the belt. If 
the holes are carelessly made, so that those in the two ends are 
not in alignment, the belt when laced will not run true. 
3. Make the Holes.—For leather belts the holes may be 
cut out with a hollow punch. A punch of an oval form is 
preferred, and if such a one is used the long diameter of the 
hole should be parallel to the side of the belt. 
The size should be such that the lacing will pull in tightly 
and still not tear the belt. For canvas belts or rubber belts, 
the holes should be made with an awl and not with a hollow 
punch, since the punch cuts off many strands and greatly 
weakens the belt. The tine of an old pitchfork will make a 
very good awl for this purpose, and the oval shape will be 
found convenient. When using an awl, work it back and 
forth sidewise when passing through the belt, thus making a 
hole by forcing the fibers apart instead of cutting them. 
4, Put in the lace.—On pages 136-143 directions are given 
for putting in five types of lacings. It is best to select from the 
 
-P-A-G-E-153
JOINING ENDS OF BELT WITH A RAWHIDE THONG 135 
lacings listed one or two suited to the individual needs (see 
page 117) and then learn how to put these in. One of the types 
of straight lacings (Figs. 244 and 247) and the single hinged 
lacing (Fig. 250) will be found to meet most requirements. 
5. Secure the ends of the rawhide thong.—After the belt 
is laced, it is necessary to secure, in some manner, the ends of 
the lace. This may be done in several ways, the method 
employed depending upon the type of lacing and the individual 
preference. 
(a) Tying the ends.—This method is often used on lacings 
where but one side of the belt comes in contact with the 
pulleys. Simply tie the ends together in a square knot (Fig. 
245). 
(b) Slitting the lace—With a knife, carefully cut a slit in 
the belt just above the last hole through which the lace is 
passed. The length of the slit should be cut parallel with the 
sides of the belt. Pass the lace down through this slit and pull 
it up tightly, make a diagonal cut half way through the lace 
close to the surface of the belt. After cutting, give the lacing a 
twist. This will form a prong, as on a fish hook, at the end of 
the lace, which will keep it from pulling back through the slit 
(Fig. 248). The other end of the lace is secured in a similar 
manner. 
(c) Doubling the lace through a punched hole——Punch a small 
hole in the belt, just beyond the last hole through which the 
lace was carried. Pass the lace through this hole, loop and 
pass it back through the same hole again and cut the end off, 
leaving about } inch (see Fig. 250). This method is the 
simplest, and in the opinion of the authors, the best. 
Of the various types of rawhide lacings, directions are here 
given for making the following: 
(a). Single straight lacing. 
(b) Double straight lacing. 
(c) Single hinged lacing. 
(d) Double hinged lacing. 
(e) Lock lacing. 
 
-P-A-G-E-154
  136 BELTS, PULLEYS AND SHAFTING 
(a) Single straight lacing—Cut the ends of the belt off 
square. Lay out the marks for the holes (Table 5, page 134, 
Figs. 242 and 243). Make the holes as marked, using a tool 
suitable for the type of belt. Do not make the holes too large, 
for the lace is to pass but once through each hole. Referring 
to Figs. 244 and 245, which show the finished single straight 
lacing, it will be noted that: 
1. All laces on the pulley side of the belt are straight. 
  Fig. 244.—Single Straight Lacing, Fic. 245.—Single Straight 
Pulley Side. Lacing. 
2. All laces on the other side run diagonally, part one way 
and part the other, so that the ends of the belt will not be 
offset. 
3. The lace is never passed from a hole in one belt end to 
another hole in the same belt end. 
Butt the ends of the belt together and, holding the belt 
pulley side up, proceed as follows: Pass one end of the lace
-P-A-G-E-155

down through hole 1 and the other end down through hole 8. 
Pull the lace until the two ends are the same length. Run the 
lace that passes 
down through 1 as 
follows: Up through

  The ends, one 
passing down through 14 and the other down through 7 may be 
fastened by tying (Fig. 245). The pulley side of this lacing is 
shown in Tig. 244. 
(6) Double straight lacing—Cut the ends of the belt off 
square. Lay off the marks for the holes according to the width 
of the belt (Table 5 and Figs. 242 and 243). Make the holes 
through the belt with a punch or awl according to the type of 
belt. As the lace is to pass twice through each of the holes, 
they must be made larger than for single straight lacing. 
Referring to Figs. 247 and 248, which show the finished 
double straight lacing it will be noted that on the pulley side 
all of the laces are straight while the diagonal laces are on the 
other side, as in the case of the single straight lacing. The laces 
on the pulley side are double, except between holes 1 and 14 (Fig. 
249). With these points in mind, proceed to make the lacing as  
-P-A-G-E-156
  138 BELTS, PULLEYS AND SHAFTING 
follows: Holding the belt pulley side down, pass one end of the 
lace up through hole 1, and the other end of the lace up through 
hole 16. Draw the lace until the two ends are the same 
length. 
Run the lace which passes up through hole 1 as follows: 
Down through hole 2, up through 3, down through 4, up 
through 5, down through 6, up through 7, down through 8, up 
   Fia. 247.—Double Straight Fic. 248.—Double Straight 
Lacing, Pulley Side. Lacing. 
through 9, down through 10, up through 11, down through 12, 
up through 13, and down through 14. 
Run the other end of the lace, in a similar manner, to the 
left edge of the belt and back to the center. If it is passed 
through the holes in order from 16 to 29 inclusive, it will end 
passing down through hole 29. 
The ends may now be secured, either by slitting the lace 
or doubling it as described on page 135.
-P-A-G-E-157

(c) Single hinged lacing—Cut the ends of the belt off 
square, and for leather belts bevel the edges slightly. Mark 
the holes (see page 134, Table 5, and Figs. 242 and 248), and 
punch with a suitable tool. 
In making this lacing it should be especially noted that in

holes in the manner described for the single hinged lacing. The 
finished lacing is shown in Figs. 253 and 254. 
Make the lacing in the same manner as the double straight 
lacing, with one exception. Whenever the lace is run from 
one belt to the other it is always passed between the ends of the 
belt. This lacing is not as desirable as the single-hinged lacing, 
because, as usually made, there are too many strands of this 
lace passing through between the ends of the belt. This is liable

to cause chafing of the strands at the ends of the belt, resulting 
in undue wear. 
(e) Lock lacing.—Cut the ends off square and punch two 
rows of holes, each containing 4, 5, 6, or more holes according 
to the width of the belt. Space the holes uniformly as indi- 
cated (Fig. 255). 
It will be noted that each of the holes in the two inside 
rows contains three numbers. This indicates that the lace 
passes through each of these holes three times. 
Run one end of the rawhide thong down through hole 1 in

the order indicated (Fig. 255). Run the other end of the lace 
to the left in the order indicated. One lace end will finish at 
hole 23 and the other end at hole 17 in belt end M. They may 
be tied as shown in Fig. 257 to hold them. The finished lacing

4, JOINING THE ENDS OF A BELT WITH A WIRE LACE 
Operations: 
1. Prepare the ends of the belt. 
2. Measure off the required amount of lace. 
3. Lace the belt. 
4. Secure the ends of the lace. 
Tools and Equipment: 
Try square, awl or small punch, pliers, wire lacing. This wire 
- lace is used for leather belts and is sold in rolls of 50 feet, of different 
sizes for single and double leather. 
1. Prepare the ends of the belt.—Cut the ends of the belt 
off square. Draw a line across the belt a distance from the 
end equal to the thickness of the belt. Punch the holes on 
this line, placing the first hole not over + inch from the edge of 
the belt and spacing the others } inch from center to center 
(Fig. 258). For belts over 8 inches wide, space the holes 4 inch 
apart and put in the lacing in two or more sections. 
2. Measure off the required amount of lace.—For single 
leather belts cut off a piece of wire lace equal in length to seven 
times the width of the belt; for double leather belts cut off a 
piece nine times as long as the width of the belt. 
3. Lace the belt.—Begin the lacing at the two center holes. 
Pass the lace twice through each hole, thus forming a double 
lace (Fig. 259). Work to the left with one end and to the 
right with the other. Take care that one strand of the wire
-P-A-G-E-162
  144 BELTS, PULLEYS AND SHAFTING 
lace does not overlap the other. As the lace is passed through 
the holes, pull it up tightly with a pair of pliers. 
4, Secure the ends of the lace—When the end holes are 
reached, double lace them and then pass the end of the lace 
through the next inner hole and cut the end off, leaving it

about 4+ inch long. Bend this end toward the joint, or tuck 
it under the lace as shown in Fig. 259. Flatten down the 
whole joint by hammering. The finished lacing is shown in 
Figs. 258 and 259. 
5. JOINING THE ENDS OF A BELT WITH A RIGID METAL LACE 
Tools and Equipment: 
Rigid metal lace, hammer. 
Cut the ends of the belt off square and butt them together 
on a piece of soft wood. Keep the ends of the belt in position 
by tacking them to the wood. Place the metal lace in position
-P-A-G-E-163
JOINING ENDS OF BELT WITH A METAL LACE 145 
on the joint, on the side of the belt which is to run away from 
the pulley, as shown in Fig. 260 and tap lightly to mark where 
the spurs will enter the leather. 
Remove the lace and make the 
holes with a pointed awl. Re- 
place the lace in position and 
drive the spurs through. Remove 
the belt from the board, turn it 
over on a metal pulley or ona 
convenient piece of iron and 
clinch the spurs, bending them 
toward the joint. Take care to 
imbed the points of the prongs 
in the surface of the belt with- 
out excessive hammering at the 
bend of the prongs. 
This steel lace may be ob- 
tained in different sizes and in 
assorted lengths. The only point 
that can be advanced in favor 
of this lacing is that it is easily 
and quickly put in. The joint 
is rigid, and the spurs cut the 
belt to such an extent that the 
repeated bending in use tends to 
of the lines of perforation.

prongs until the points of the teeth of the first prongs show 
through. Place the belt on a piece of wood and drive the 
teeth of both sides as far through as possible, and then clinch 
the points over. Finish the lacing by replacing the belt on a 
piece of metal, and further clinch the teeth and flatten the 
prongs and the bar section as much as possible. Equip the 
other end of the belt in a similar manner. 
4, Interlock the two belt ends and install the hinge-pin.— 
Interlock the two belt ends and slip in the sectional hinge pin. 
Cut two pieces of the rocker hinge-pin the same width as the 
bar on the lacing, and assemble with the smooth faces together 
and the lugs alternating. When the lace is not to be exposed 
to moisture, a single round rawhide pin is sometimes used 
instead of the steel rocker hinge pin. The finished lacing is 
shown in Fig. 262. 
Wire lacing (machine made).—There are on the market 
several machines by means of which superior types of wire 
lacings can be very quickly applied. These lacings are in 
general of the hinged type with a rawhide pin. 
On account of the first cost, machines of this type are 
usually purchased only by those having a large number of 
belts to lace. 
7. JOINING THE ENDS OF A LEATHER BELT TO MAKE AN 
ENDLESS BELT 
Operations: 
1. Bevel each end of the belt. 
2. Apply the heated cement. 
3. Hold the cemented splice under pressure. 
Tools and equipment: 
Knife or plane, cement suitable for leather, some means of heating 
the cement, short-bristle brush, hammer, a board for a clamp, and nails. 
1. Bevel each end of the belt.—Cut the ends off square and 
then dress them down to a feather edge. Note the direction 
   
-P-A-G-E-166
148 BELTS, PULLEYS AND SHAFTING 
of the other splices in the belt and make the new one in the 
same direction as the others. Do the beveling on the flesh 
side and continue back the length of the splice, so that when 
the two ends are placed together the joint will be no thicker 
than the belt. The length of the joint will vary with the 
width of the belt. Make a lap 5 or 6 inches long for belts 
4 inches or narrower, and a lap 6 to 10 inches long for belt 
widths from 5 inches to 10 inches. Kent! states that for all 
double leather belts up to 10 inches in width the splice should 
be made 10 inches long. 
2. Apply the heated cement.—After carefully dressing the 
ends, spread the heated cement thinly over the two surfaces, 
using a short bristle brush and rubbing the glue in thoroughly. 
Apply the glue in a warm room so that it will not chill while 
being used. 
Note——A suitable belt cement can be obtained from a 
number of manufacturers or hardware stores. A glue may be 
made of the following: 
Page’s Liquid Fish Glue, 2 parts by measurement, Russian 
liquid isinglass, 1 part by measurement. 
3. Hold the cemented splice under pressure.—Put the ends 
together, hammer them, and then hold them under pressure. 
A clamp may be used, or the splice may be held by nailing a 
board over it. Allow the belt to stand at least two hours, 
or preferably overnight before using. 
The use of cement or glue makes a very smooth-running 
splice, especially well adapted to belts running over small 
pulleys. Of the various methods for joining belts, it is prob- 
ably the least troublesome in service. However, with a 
cemented splice it is difficult to readjust the belt tension in the 
belt unless the pulleys on which the belt runs are adjustable or 
an idler pulley is used.

GENERAL INFORMATION REGARDING BELTS, ETC. 149 
GENERAL INFORMATION 
Pulley sizes.—An important fact that should be understood 
is that various machines must be operated at their rated speeds 
in order to obtain their rated capacity. Too often an engine 
is belted to an ensilage cutter, feed grinder, or other machine 
without thought of speed. If the engine is belted to an ensilage 
cutter, and the cutter is run too fast, it may ‘ blow up,” 
endangering the lives of those attending the machine; while 
if the cutter is run too slow the blower pipe will soon be plugged 
up and cause most vexatious delays. When an engine is 
belted to a feed grinder the speed at which the grinder should 
be run will depend upon the horsepower of the engine. If 
such pulleys are used that the speed of the grinder is too fast 
for the engine used, then the engine will be unable to operate 
the grinder to the capacity expected at that speed. If the 
grinder is run slower, however, the same engine will be able to 
operate it to the capacity for that slower speed. In many 
cases the machine or the engine is thoughtlessly blamed and 
condemned, whereas the trouble is simply a matter of improper 
pulley sizes. 
The size of a pulley is known by the number of inches 
in its diameter and in its width of face. When both the 
diameter of the pulley and the width of the pulley face ~ 
are indicated, as a 10- by 6-inch pulley, the first number 
indicates the diameter and the second the width of the pulley 
face. 
The speed of a pulley is stated as being a certain number 
of revolutions a minute, such as 500 revolutions per minute, 
abbreviated as 500 R.P.M. 
Derivation of formula for determining sizes of pulleys.— 
The derivation of the rule (page 115) for figuring pulley sizes 
may be explained as follows: 
The speed of a point on the face of a driver determines the 
speed of a point on the belt in contact with this pulley. The 
speed of a point on the face of the driven pulley is determined
-P-A-G-E-168
  150 BELTS, PULLEYS AND SHAFTING 
by the speed of a point on the driving belt which makes con- 
tact with it. 
That is, the speed of a point on the face of a driver pulley 
connected to another by belt is the same as the speed of a point 
on the face of the driven pulley. 
The speed of a point on the face of a pulley, 7.e., rim speed, 
is equal to the circumference of the pulley multiplied by the 
number of revolutions it makes a minute. The circumference 
of any pulley equals rXdiameter or rD. The speed=xDN. 
Therefore, 
aDN =rdn, 
where 7=3.1416; 
D=diameter of driver; 
d=diameter of driven pulley; 
N=RPM of driver; 
n=RPM of driven pulley. 
Cancel 7 and we have 
DN =dn, 
or 
em N =p: 
This rule, as expressed here or on page 115, does not take 
belt slippage into consideration. Usually the diameter re- 
quired, as indicated by the rule, will lie between two standard 
sizes of pulleys. What is done then, in practice, is to select 
the next larger standard size if the pulley is a driver and the 
next smaller size if the pulley is a driven pulley. In this way 
rough allowance is made for belt slippage. 
Kinds of Pulleys.—Pulleys may be classified as to construc- 
tion (solid or split), as to material (iron, wood, or fiber), and 
as to surface (iron, wood, fiber, lag-faced). 
Construction.—Individual machines and engines usually 
come equipped with solid pulleys. They are made of cast iron, 
pressed steel, or fiber on an iron core. The use of split pulleys, 
either pressed steel or wood, is confined mainly to line shafts. 
The advantage of the split pulley is that it can be readily 
 
-P-A-G-E-169

located at any place on a line shaft without being slid on over 
the end of the shaft, and it may be easily placed on a shaft 
after the shaft is up. 
Material—Iron pulleys are substantial and durable, and 
weather conditions do not cause them to deteriorate. Wood 
pulleys are substantial but will not withstand weather condi- 
tions as well as the iron ones. Fiber pulleys are substantial, 
and as they are treated with waterproofing materials they 
will withstand weather conditions. 
Surface——The best gripping qualities are offered by the 
fiber pulleys, and the poorest by the iron pulleys. The wood 
pulleys fall between these two. Pulleys are sometimes faced 
(lagged) with leather, rubber.or canvas belting, or cord to 
increase the gripping quality of the surface. Cord facing is 
inferior to leather facing, as it is very liable to stretch and come 
loose. 
Solid pulleys are secured to the shaft either by means of a 
key or one or more set screws, depending upon the load which 
the pulley is called upon to carry. Split pulleys equipped with 
split bushings are held to the shaft by friction between the 
bushings and the shaft when the pulleys are clamped to the 
shaft. 
In Fig. 263 two kinds of split wood pulleys are shown 
apart. The grooved wooden strips between the pulleys are 
bushings. Bushings must be used with the split wood pulleys 
to make the latter fit snugly on various sizes of line shafts. 
As the diameters of the openings on wood pulleys vary and as 
the sizes of the line shafts used vary, these wood bushings are 
designated by external and internal diameters, the first to fit 
the pulley and the second to fit the line shaft. The size of 
the bushings is usually stamped on them. Several sizes of 
wood bushings are shown in Fig. 264. 
The split pulley shown in Fig. 263, comes in two parts and 
is held together by two long bolts. This pulley assembled 
without the bushing is shown in Fig. 265. The split pulley, 
Fig. 263, comes in three parts as shown. Parts 1 and 2 are

held together by four bolts. When the bushings are in place

tion, but with bushing, is shown in Fig.

Tight and loose pulleys.—A set of tight and loose pulleys 
consists of two pulleys set close together, one secured to the

shaft and the other free to turn upon it. When the machine 
or line shaft to which these pulleys are attached is idle, the 
belt. drives the loose pulley. To start the machine or line 
shaft the belt is thrown over on to the tight pulley. For con- 
venience and safety, this shifting of the belt from one pulley 
to the other is accomplished with the aid of a belt shifter, one 
type of which is shown in Fig. 267. A drive pulley connected 
to a set of tight and loose pulleys must be as wide as the sum 
of the widths of the two pulleys in the set. 
Tight and loose pulleys may be either wood or metal and 
either solid or split, 
but the type generally 
used is the solid metal 
pulley. The standard 
construction is to have 
both pulleys the same 
diameter, with the 
Fria. 267.—Belt Shifter for Throwing the Belt faces crowned. The 
On and Off of the Tight and Loose Pulleys. hub of the tight pulley 
is flush with the edge 
of the rim on each side, while the hub of the loose pulley 
extends slightly beyond the rim at each side. The bushing 
of the loose pulley is so constructed as to allow for thorough 
lubrication of the shaft. 
Movement of the loose pulley along the shaft is prevented on 
one side by the tight pulley and on the other side by a collar 
secured at the other end of the hub of the loose pulley. Either 
a solid or a split bushing may be used to make one of the 
pulleys loose on the shaft. 
Clutches.—Pulleys equipped with a friction clutch or a jaw 
clutch operate so that when the clutch is disengaged the pulley 
rides free. Usually the pulley rides on part of the clutch and 
this is secured to the shaft. By throwing the two halves of a 
jaw clutch into contact or by increasing the pressure on the 
disks or shoes of a friction clutch, the pulley is thrown into 
motion. 
    
  
-P-A-G-E-173
  GENERAL INFORMATION REGARDING BELTS, ETC. 155 
Faces of pulleys.—The shape of the face of the pulley has 
much to do with keeping the belt in place. 
If the shafts of two pulleys are parallel and the centers of 
the faces of the pulleys are in a straight line, a belt will run 
centrally over the two pulleys. Theoretically for such condi- 
tions a straight-faced pulley may be used. In practice, how- 
ever, pulleys are usually slightly out of alignment and unless 
proper provision is made, the belt would tend to run off. To 
overcome this difficulty, use is made of the well-known fact that 
a belt will climb to the high part of the pulley. If the center of 
the pulley is slightly higher than the rest of the face, the belt 
will tend to run to the center even if that pulley is slightly out of 
alignment. A pulley so constructed is called a crowned pulley. 
BELTS 
The majority of farm problems in which flexible connections 
are used for transmitting motion are those in which the connec- 
tion is a flat band or belt. 
There are three kinds of belts in common use: canvas, 
rubber, and leather. 
Canvas belts.—Canvas belts are made of canvas or duck, 
folded to two thicknesses and stitched to form a 2-ply belt, 
folded to three thicknesses and stitched to form a 3-ply belt, 
etc. They are thoroughly impregnated with some water- 
proofing material and then painted, are considered very durable, 
will withstand much “ punishment” by the elements and 
therefore are used extensively with tractor outfits. Since 
canvas belts tend to shrink and stretch with different weather 
conditions, they are not as suitable as the other types of belts 
for use between stationary shafts or pulleys. They are often 
condemned because the lacing will not hold, but this is more 
often due to the method of making the lacing than to the type 
of belt. 
Care of canvas belts —The care of canvas belts will depend 
somewhat on their manufacture. Some manufacturers claim 
that the belt is so treated at the factory that no belt dressing 
   
-P-A-G-E-174
     
   156 BELTS, PULLEYS AND SHAFTING 
need be applied. The light application of raw linseed oil has 
been recommended for keeping canvas belting in good working 
condition. The best rule to follow is to obtain and use that 
belt dressing recommended by the maker of your belt. Others 
have recommended the application of a mixture of red lead 
and linseed oil. Canvas belts should be kept in a dry place 
when not in use. 
Rubber belts.— Rubber belts are made of one or more layers 
of cotton duck alternating with layers of rubber vulcanized onto 
the duck. They are made from 2- to 8-ply. They will stand, 
without deteriorating, heat, moisture, and steam that would 
ruin leather belts. When properly adjusted they have a good 
grip on pulleys and give little trouble from slippage. Although 
they do not shrink and stretch like canvas belts, they are easily 
damaged by oil or grease. 
A rubber belt should always be run with the seam away 
from the pulleys. The seam is near the center of the face and 
is often covered with a narrow strip of rubber. 
Care of rubber belting.—Of the several methods recommended 
for the care of rubber belts a few are here included: (1) The 
occasional application, to the rubbing surface, of a few drops of 
castor oil; (2) boiled linseed oil applied sparingly with a rag; 
(3) the application of a composition made of equal parts of red 
lead, black lead, French yellow and litharge mixed with boiled 
oil and enough japan drier to make it dry quickly. This com- 
position should be put on with a paint brush and allowed to dry. 
As light, especially direct sunlight, and extreme dryness 
tend to rot rubber belts, they should be stored in a dark and 
preferably damp place. 
Leather belts.—These are made from strips of leather from 
40 to 60 inches long, the best grades being cut from the center 
portion of the entire hide, along the back. These pieces are 
cemented together to form belts of different lengths and thick- 
nesses. The single- and double-thickness belts are the ones in 
most common use. In making double-thickness belts, the 
flesh sides of the leather are cemented together. The thickness
-P-A-G-E-175
  GENERAL INFORMATION REGARDING BELTS, ETC. 157 
of a single leather belt is about 3 inch, of a double belt about 
zs inch. 
Good leather belts, under proper conditions and protection, 
are more durable and more satisfactory than rubber or canvas, 
but they have the disadvantage of being more expensive. 
They are used chiefly indoors, for unless specially treated they 
should not be subjected to moisture. Because they stretch 
and shrink less than canvas belts, they are better adapted for 
use between pulleys on fixed centers. Since mineral oil is 
injurious to them they should be protected from it. The 
general practice in this country, and the one recommended 
by prominent makers of leather belts, is to run the hair side 
of a leather belt next to the pulley. The flesh side is more 
flexible and will more readily accommodate itself to the curva- 
ture around the pulley, whereas if the more rigid hair side is 
obliged to stretch in going around the pulley it will, in time, 
crack. 
The opinion of authorities, as to the direction in which a 
spliced belt should run, differs. In a belt drive the slippage 
will be the greatest at the small pulley. It is the opinion of 
the authors that if the driver pulley is the smaller a leather 
belt should be put on so that the thin edge of the splice will 
come on to the pulley first, while if the driven pulley is the 
smaller the belt should be put on so that the thin edge of the 
splice will come on to the pulley last. The reasons for this 
can be seen by studying the conditions set forth above. 
Care of leather belts —A leather belt will last much longer 
and give less trouble from slipping if kept in proper condition. 
The stiff, harsh leather coming from the tanning vats is 
treated with lubricants to reduce the internal friction and make 
the leather suitable for belting. The continuous bending and 
pulling of the belt in use works these lubricants to the surface 
of the leather, from which in time they are removed. The 
belt becomes dry and the surface glazed, with a resulting 
increase in slippage and eventual destruction of the belt through 
dry rot. These conditions of the leather should be avoided 
 
-P-A-G-E-176
  158 BELTS, PULLEYS AND SHAFTING 
by the application of a belt dressing. Neatsfoot oil is con- 
sidered an excellent dressing if not applied in excessive amounts. 
After the first few dressings of a single leather belt, the preserva- 
tive should be applied mainly to the back (side away from 
pulley) of the belt. If the oil is applied in this way, a sufficient 
amount of it will work through to the pulley side of the belt 
and the slight excess of it will not cause the belt to slip. It is 
very desirable to allow the belt to stand overnight before 
running, so that the lubricant may soak into the fibers. Small 
quantities of dressing frequently applied are considered better 
than larger quantities applied at long intervals. A properly 
dressed belt feels mellow, but not greasy. 
A belt should be kept clean. If a coating of dust and oil 
collects, it may be scraped off with the edge of a block of hard 
wood. Powdered chalk spread on an oily belt will absorb the 
oil, and if the chalk is then scraped off much of the oil will be 
removed from the belt surface. Moderate quantities of surface 
grease can be washed off the belt with a cloth moistened with 
gasoline. 
OPEN AND CROSSED BELTS 
Open belts.—For overhead shafting, the shafts of the two 
pulleys should not be placed one directly under the other 
unless absolutely unavoidable. Such an arrangement greatly 
increases the tendency to belt slippage, as the belt naturally 
hangs away from the lower pulley. Under such conditions 
greater belt tension is necessary for successful operation. 
The best arrangement would be to have the shafts of the two 
pulleys on the same level. Such an arrangement if the tight 
side of the belt is on the lower side, will give the greatest possible 
amount of belt in contact with the pulleys, because of the natural 
sag of the belt (Fig. 268). Between these two positions will fall 
the average shop arrangement. Whenever possible, plans 
should be made to locate the engine or machinery so that the 
belt to or from the shaft will make an angle with the floor not 
greater than 45 degrees.
-P-A-G-E-177
  GENERAL INFORMATION REGARDING BELTS, ETC. 159 
Machinery, whenever possible, should be so placed that the 
tight strand of the belt will be on the lower side. With the 
loose side of the belt on the top, the gentle sag of the belt will 
increase the wrap of the belt on the pulley. The amount of 
(/

this sag will depend largely on the distance between pulleys 
or shafts. 
Within the range of belt widths and pulley sizes used 
around the average farm, a distance between pulleys and 
shafts of 8 to 10 feet is a good average. If the pulleys are of 
the same size they may be operated successfully when 4 feet 
or even less apart. If, however, one pulley is considerably 
larger than the other, it is best to place them 8 to 12 feet apart.

Fia. 269.—If it is Necessary to Locate Two Pulleys Close Together an 
Idler Pulley Should be Used. 
If it is necessary to locate two pulleys close together and 
trouble is experienced from the slipping of the belt, an idler 
pulley should be installed against the slack side of the belt 
and near the smaller pulley (Fig. 269). By taking up the slack 
in the belt, an idler pulley increases the tension and also the  
-P-A-G-E-178
  160 BELTS, PULLEYS AND SHAFTING 
wrap of the belt on the smaller pulley. This increase of tension 
and increase of are of contact decrease the belt slippage. 
Crossed belts.—A crossed belt is sometimes used on pulleys 
set close together, for the purpose of increasing the wrap of the 
belt on the pulleys, thus preventing slippage. A similar ar- 
rangement is also used when it is desired to reverse the direction 
of the driven pulley and to: prevent a long open belt from 
flapping. 
Homemade devices for installing a line shaft.—In the pre- 
ceding pages on the subjects of pulleys and line shafting, the 
various types of pulleys that can be purchased, the sizes of 
standard line shafting, the various types of equipment for 
supporting shafting, the purpose and construction of collars, 
couplings, ete., have been discussed. 
One naturally wonders whether all of this more or less 
elaborate and costly equipment is necessary before a satisfactory 
farm shop can be installed and equipped. Unquestionably 
this regular equipment is highly desirable and satisfactory, 
but some of it is not absolutely necessary for the average 
small shop, since certain homemade devices may be made and 
substituted for the regular equipment. The extent to which 
such devices are made and installed will depend largely upon 
the individual farmer’s ingenuity and the necessity of his 
economizing in the outlay for equipment. 
Because of the fact that the arrangements for each shop 
will undoubtedly differ, only certain general suggestions will 
be given here. It will be left to the individual to take these 
offered suggestions, modify them where necessary, and then 
apply them to his own particular problem. 
A homemade pulley—A homemade solid wood pulley is 
shown in Fig. 270, C. The width desired is obtained by nailing 
together several pieces of wood cut to a circular form of the 
desired diameter. On each side two strips of wood are attached. 
These are fastened to the pulley only at the ends. Holes are 
bored in each strip, and two long bolts passed through. The 
pulley is slipped on the line shaft, the bolts drawn up, and the
-P-A-G-E-179
  GENERAL INFORMATION REGARDING BELTS, ETC. 161 
two side strips are drawn down tightly and clamped against 
the shaft. Such pulleys can be used only for light work. 
The pulley shown is attached to a length of galvanized pipe. 
Such a pipe may be used for a line shaft when light loads only 
are to be transmitted. 
A homemade pillow block.—A homemade pillow block is 
shown in Fig. 270, A. This same block, taken apart, is shown in 
Fig. 270, B. Both the box that supports the shaft and the cap 
that is screwed down to the box are of wood. The shaft is 
lubricated through an oil hole provided in the cap. The

proper bearing adjustment is obtained with the cardboard 
shims shown. In the case of this block are two elongated 
openings through which pass the bolts used for adjusting the 
bearings. These elongated openings permit a sideways adjust- 
ment of the box and cap. Two other holes are provided in the 
base, so that the entire pillow block may be secured by bolts 
to a floor or beam. It is recommended that maple be used, 
especially for the construction of the box and cap. 
For light loads this pillow block could be used as a post 
block, or a very simple post block with the bearing split hori- 
zontally could be made of wood.

Post hangers and drop hangers.—In Figs. 271, A and B, are 
shown two homemade supports for line shaft bearings, the 
first being a drop hanger and the second a post hanger. The 
construction of each is so elementary and so clearly shown in 
the figures that no description seems necessary. 
Line shafting—The writers have seen a number of farm 
shops in which iron water pipe was satisfactorily used for line 
shafting. The size most generally used when small amounts 
of power are to be transmitted is {-inch pipe. The external

diameter of this size pipe is slightly over 1 inch. If a long 
length of shafting is desired two lengths of pipe joined with a 
coupling may be used, for if run in the proper direction the 
pipes will tighten at the coupling. If the end hangers are 
placed at the extreme ends of the shaft and properly braced 
and a strip of metal or a block of wood is fastened over the 
end of each hanger, the shaft will be kept from moving side- 
wise through the hangers. This arrangement eliminates the 
necessity of using couplings and collars. 
A small power plant.—A line shaft of water pipe, supported

is shown in Fig. 272. One end of the shaft runs against the 
side of the building, while the other end bears against a metal 
strip nailed over the opening in the homemade end hanger.

SOLDERING 
1. SOLDERING TIN 
Operations (applied to jobs 1 through 5 inclusive): 
1. Clean the metal. 
2. Apply the proper flux. 
3. Apply the solder with a tinned and heated copper. 
For special directions and explanation see pages 182 and 185. 
Tools and equipment: 
Blow torch, two soldering coppers, flux, sandpaper or emery paper, 
scrapers, solder, tin shears. 
For soldering tin, the best fluxes are, for new tin, either 
resin or chloride of zine, and for old tin, chloride of zine. 
Soldering a small or a medium-sized hole: 
First, thoroughly clean the surface around the hole (Fig. 
273, A) by scraping or by the use of sandpaper or emery paper 
(Fig. 273, B). Then apply a flux to the cleaned surface. Take 
a small amount of solder on the end of the copper, and apply a 
coating of solder to the surface around the hole. 
In handling the copper, hold tke heel, not the point of it, on 
the work. This is of special importance when soldering old 
work. It is necessary, when soldering, to bring the tempera- 
ture of the material being soldered up to the temperature 
of the melted solder, so that the solder will flow over the 
metal. The point of a soldering copper loses its heat quickly. 
Move the soldering copper around the hole, coating the metal

around the hole with solder and filling the hole. Upon the 
removal of the copper, the solder will harden (Fig. 273, D), 
closing the hole. Some persons, when soldering a small hole, 
place the point of the copper in the hole, holding the copper 
vertically, and, by revolving the soldering copper, “ spin” the 
hole full of solder. While this method quickly solders the hole 
shut, it is not as desirable as the one just described, for the

reason that the solder closing the hole does not have as good a 
grip on the metal around the hole. 
Soldering a large hole: 
To repair a large hole it is necessary to solder on a patch. 
This may be done either by placing the patch over the hole and 
soldering it around the edges, or by ‘‘ sweating on ” the patch. 
The second method is preferable for old tin. 
Soldering on a patch: 
Cut a piece of tin for a patch a little larger than the hole 
to be soldered. Thoroughly clean one side of the patch, as well 
as the surfaces around the hole, and apply a suitable flux to 
 
-P-A-G-E-184
  166 SOLDERING 
these cleaned surfaces. Place the patch, cleaned side down, 
over the hole, and hold it in position with the tang of a file or 
with some other suitable tool. If the metal being soldered is 
old, tin the surfaces around the hole before applying the patch. 
With the aid of a heated copper, run solder around the edges 
of the patch. If the patch is large, it is well, before running 
the solder around the 
patch, to “tack” the 
patch in position in 
several places with a 
little solder.

  copper, where the cop- 
per has heated the 
patch. The joint resulting from soldering on a patch by 
this method, if properly done, is very uniform, especially 
with large patches. 
“ Sweating on” a patch: 
When preparing to “sweat on” a patch, cut a patch, 
clean one side of it, as well as the surfaces around the hole, 
and apply to these cleaned surfaces a suitable flux. Take up 
some solder with a heated copper, and coat or “tin” the 
cleaned side of the patch (Fig. 275). If the metal is old, tin the 
surfaces around the hole also. All is now prepared for the 
sweating on of the patch. Lay the patch over the hole, tinned 
side down. Hold the patch in place, and apply heat to the

entire patch will be firmly soldered. 
2. SOLDERING IRON AND STEEL 
The flux suitable for soldering iron and steel is chloride of 
zine, and, for galvanized iron, muriatic acid. 
When soldering iron or steel, it is necessary that the metal 
shall first be covered with a thin layer of solder, after which 
it may be soldered as if it were ordinary tin. 
Soldering new metal: 
As in all soldering processes, even with new metals, thor- 
oughly clean the surfaces by filing, scraping, or using an emery 
wheel, and then apply some chloride of zine to these cleaned 
surfaces. ‘Take up some solder with the hot copper, and work 
this solder over the surfaces to be coated. Hold the heel 
of the copper on the work. It may be necessary to make two 
or three applications of the flux and of the solder before the 
coating is as desired. 
Soldering old metal: 
When soldering old, rusty iron, first remove as much of 
the rust as possible by filing or grinding, then apply some 
muriatic acid. This causes an oxidizing action, which eats 
under the old coating of rust, thus enabling one to remove it 
with a wire brush. After this, wash off the muriatic acid with 
water, and then apply chloride of zine previous to coating 
the metal with solder. Washing off the muriatic acid decreases 
the danger of the metal rusting under the solder, and usually 
results, therefore, in a more lasting repair. 
Soldering galvanized iron: 
Galvanized iron, or galvanized steel, is merely iron or steel 
that has been coated with a thin layer of zinc. Apply some 
muriatic acid to the surfaces around the hole. The application
-P-A-G-E-187
  SOLDERING IRON AND STEEL 169 
of the acid sets up a chemical action, the acid bubbling and 
sending off a vapor. Allow this action to continue for a 
minute or two, and then, while it is still wet with the acid, tin 
the surface with a hot copper as previously described. While 
tinning the surfaces, also apply the solder over the hole, and 
it will stick to the tinned metal around the hole, thus closing it.

in until the hole is full, or a patch may be soldered on. The 
latter method is the more difficult, however. 
Filling in a large hole: 
Thoroughly clean the surfaces around a large hole and tin 
them, as previously described. Use muriatic acid as a flux. 
Lay a piece of cloth under the hole, and melt a quantity of 
solder on to the cloth and the metal around the hole. Usually 
this melted solder will run to one corner. Starting at this 
corner, draw the copper slowly across the hole. The melted

solder will follow the copper, and if the movement is slow 
enough, it will hang together until the entire opening is closed 
(Figs. 277, 278). If the copper is too hot, the solder will break 
away from the copper and run to the edges of the hole, instead 
of building in the hole. 
Patching a large hole: 
Thoroughly clean and tin the surfaces around the hole, and 
also on one side of the patch. Place the patch in position, 
tinned side down, and, with a heated copper, run solder around 
the edges as explained on page 165.

galvanized iron may be soldered with resin or commercial 
paste as a flux, although neither of these is recommended, as 
the operation is much harder and the work is not likely to hold 
as well. Thoroughly clean the surfaces by scraping or sanding 
before applying the flux. Apply the flux, and then take up 
some solder with a hot copper, and work the solder over the 
surfaces to be tinned. Apply the flux and the solder several 
times, working the solder well “ into” the metal. In this way, 
a coating of solder may be made to adhere.

Soldering agateware: 
The base of agateware vessels is iron. In order to repair 
utensils made of this material, it is necessary to remove the 
agate covering from the iron, to thoroughly clean the iron, to 
apply the proper (killed-acid) flux, and then to solder the 
utensils as you would any piece of iron.

The steps in repairing a small hole in an agateware dish 
are shown in Fig. 279. The small hole, with the agate covering 
removed from around it and the iron base cleaned with sand- 
paper or emery paper, or by the application of muriatic acid 
which is later washed off, is shown in Fig. 279—1. A flux 
suitable for iron is then applied, and the hole is closed with

solder (Fig. 279—2). which adheres tightly to the metal 
around the hole. 
A special method, suitable for large holes: 
A method of repairing larger holes, especially in agate or 
galvanized-iron pails, is shown in Fig. 279—5. Remove the 
agate from the surface around the hole, and thoroughly clean 
the iron, as previously explained. Insert a copper rivet, place 
the washer, and enlarge the end of the rivet (Figs. 279—4) to 
hold the rivet in place. Apply a proper flux, and cover the end 
of the rivet, as well as the metal around the rivet, with solder 
(Fig. 279—5), applied with the soldering copper. The rivet 
alone is probably sufficient in most cases, but soldering the 
rivet will undoubtedly make the finished job more lasting and 
more sanitary, 
3. SOLDERING COPPER AND BRASS 
Chloride of zine is the best flux for soldering copper and 
brass. As with iron and steel, the surfaces to be soldered 
must first be covered with a coating of solder, and with copper 
or brass this operation is very easy. Although but one flux is 
listed, almost any flux may be used for either copper or brass. 
Soldering new and old metal: 
For soldering new metal, clean the surfaces by scraping or 
sandpapering, apply the flux, and coat with solder. For dirty 
metal, or for very thin metal which cannot be scraped, the 
cleaning may be simplified by first applying muriatic acid. 
This will quickly brighten the surfaces, after which it should 
be washed off, a flux applied, and the surfaces tinned. 
Repairing a split copper or brass tube: 
Thoroughly clean the surfaces of the pipe on each side of 
the split and around the pipe the length of the leak. This may 
be done by filing, sandpapering, or scraping. Be sure that no  
-P-A-G-E-191
SOLDERING COPPER AND BRASS 173 
unclean crevices are left. If there are any cracks that are hard 
to clean, apply some muriatic acid. This will penetrate and 
clean the crevices or cracks. Wash off this acid with water, 
so that its oxidizing action will not continue under the soldered 
surfaces. 
After having thoroughly cleaned the tube, made the repair 
either with copper wire or with a tin or a copper patch. 
Repairing a split tube with copper wire: 
Closely and tightly wind some No. 18 or No. 20 bare, clean 
copper wire around the split, starting a little above and running 
the length of the split to a point below it. Now apply a suitable 
flux, for example, chloride of zinc, to the entire surface to be

soldered. Hold the tube in the flame of the blow torch, with 
the split side down, and when it is heated, apply solder directly 
by rubbing the heated tube with a stick of bar solder or wire 
solder. Hold the tube with the split down, so that the melted 
solder will not flow through and into the tube. When this 
has been completed, a strong and lasting repair has been made 
(Fig. 280). If a blow torch is not available, the tube can be 
heated in other ways, or, if desired, a heated soldering copper 
can be used for applying the solder. 
Repairing a split tube with a tin or a copper patch: 
Instead of copper wire, use a thin piece of sheet copper or of 
new tin. Cut this a little longer than the length of the split 
and a little wider than the circumference of the tube. After
-P-A-G-E-192

thoroughly cleaning the tube throughout and beyond the 
length of the split (Fig. 281, A), wrap this piece of sheet metal 
snugly around the pipe, forming it into place with the aid of 
pinchers. Hold this strip tightly in place with two or more 
turns of wire, twisted tight (Fig. 281, B). Apply a suitable 
flux (page 172), and coat the whole with solder, using a heated 
copper. ‘The finished repair is shown in Fig. 281, C.

4, SOLDERING ZINC 
On new zine, chloride of zine is a suitable flux, and on old 
- gine, muriatic acid, or, if well cleaned, chloride of zinc, may be 
used. 
The methods already described apply to the tinning of 
zine previous to soldering. If the zinc is thin, apply the solder 
immediately after the muriatic acid, and work fast, for the acid 
will very soon eat through the zinc. Do not heat the copper 
too hot, for if it is too hot, it will melt the zinc as well as the 
solder. 
5. SOLDERING LEAD 
Tallow, tallow and resin, or resin may be used as fluxes for 
soldering lead. 
Soldering a hole in lead: 
As the bright luster of a cleaned piece of lead quickly gives 
place to a dull, leaden appearance, we know that the oxidation
-P-A-G-E-193
  SOLDERING LEAD 175 
of lead is rapid. Therefore, immediately after scraping the 
surfaces around the hole, apply some flux, preferably tallow. 
After applying the flux, tin the surfaces around the hole, and 
close the hole. When soldering lead, have the copper barely 
hot enough to cause the solder to flow. 
Soldering two pieces of lead pipe together: 
Enlarge the end of the pipe toward which the liquid is to 
flow by the use of a turning pin or some other suitable tool.

for a flux as the lead is scraped. Then file the end of the other 
piece of lead pipe to a taper on the outside, and apply tallow. 
Taper this end so that when the pipes are assembled there will 
be a smooth joint on the inside. Assemble the two pipes and, 
with a hot copper, melt some solder and drop it into the joint 
at two or three places. Run the solder into position, with the 
copper heated just enough to melt the solder so that it will flow 
into place and quickly cool. If the copper is too hot, the lead 
will be overheated and will flow through the joint and into the 
pipe before cooling.

Soldering lead pipe to brass, iron, or galvanized-iron pipe: 
Enlarge the end of the lead pipe by means of a turning pin

apply tallow immediately (Fig. 282, A). 
File or grind the end of the brass, iron, or galvanized-iron 
pipe to a taper, clean thoroughly, apply the proper flux (pages 
168 and 174), and, with a heated copper, tin the end of the 
pipe which is to be inserted into the lead pipe (Fig. 282, B). 
Assemble the two pipes, run some solder into the joint, and, 
with the aid of a heated (but not too hot) copper, run this 
solder into place (Fig. 282, C). 
SOLDERING ALUMINUM 
The soldering of aluminum is very difficult, if not impossible. 
An experienced tinsmith, personally known by the writers, has 
been unable to make permanent soldering repairs on aluminum, 
even by the use of special aluminum fluxes and special aluminum 
solders. After a while, even with the most carefully executed 
work, the solder invariably loosens and comes away from the 
aluminum. 
6. MAKING KILLED ACID 
Operations: 
1. Prepare the zine. 
2. Add zine to muriatic acid (HCl). 
3. Filter or allow the compound to settle. 
Tools and materials: 
Tin shears, scraper, heavy glass bottle with stopper, muriatic acid 
(HCl), zine. 
1. Prepare the zinc.—Take some small pieces of metallic 
zine, or, if these are not available, an old dry cell. Tear 
off and thoroughly clean (by scraping or by washing with 
muriatic acid) its zine lining, and cut this into small pieces, 
$ inch square.
-P-A-G-E-195
  TINNING A SOLDERING COPPER ve 
2. Add zinc to muriatic acid (HCl).—Into a quart glass jar 
or some other glass container, pour some muriatic acid (HCl), 
being sure, first, that the jar is dry. Slowly add the small pieces 
of zine to the muriatic acid, until the acid ceases to bubble and 
a piece of metal remains undissolved in the bottom of the jar. 
Because of the fumes given off when the zinc is added to the 
acid, it is best to do this work in a well-ventilated place, prefer- 
ably outdoors. If the zinc is added too rapidly, the acid will 
work too vigorously and may boil out over the top of the jar, 
‘or the heat generated may break the container. When the 
action of the acid ceases, a solution ‘of chloride of zinc has been 
formed. 
3. Filter, or allow the compound to settle.—Filter this com- 
pound through two or three thicknesses of cloth into another 
glass jar, or else allow it to settle; then pour off the clear liquid. 
For soldering new metal, dilute this solution by the addition of 
about one-fourth more of clean water. The solution is now 
ready to use, and should be applied with either a wooden or a 
zine swab. Such a solution may be used for soldering most 
metals except galvanized iron and old zine. 
If it is difficult to obtain the muriatic acid locally, some 
chloride of zinc in powder form might be purchased. To 
4 ounces of water add one teapooonful of this powdered chloride 
of zinc to make a solution of “ cut acid,” or chloride of zinc. 
7. TINNING A SOLDERING COPPER 
Operations: 
1. Clean the copper. 
2. Apply a flux. 
3. Apply the solder. 
4. Wipe off the excess solder. 
Tools and materials: 
Blow torch, soldering copper, file, solder, flux (sal ammoniac, resin, 
chloride of zinc), waste or wiping cloth.
-P-A-G-E-196
  
178 SOLDERING 
When the bit of a soldering copper is exposed to the air, it 
becomes covered with an oxide. Unless the point of the bit of 
the soldering copper has been coated with either solder or block 
tin (“ tinned,” or “ faced ’’), melted solder will not adhere to the 
copper, and it becomes difficult to use. In order to tin a copper, 
then, four steps are necessary: (1) to clean the copper (Fig. 
_ 283); (2) to apply a flux (Fig. 284); (3) to apply the solder 
(Fig. 285); and (4) to wipe off the excess solder (Fig. 286). 
There are several ways of putting a coating of solder on the 
  Fig, 283.—Tinning a Soldering Copper. Cleaning the copper by filing. 
faces of the copper bit, all of which, however, include these 
four steps. The method used, although determined somewhat 
by the condition of the bit, is largely a matter of personal choice. 
1. Clean the copper.—The purpose of cleaning is to remove 
from the faces of the point of the copper bit all of the oxide of 
its own or of other metals. If the copper is in bad condition 
(Fig. 288, B) heat it first and then, while still hot, file each 
face until the copper is bright (Fig. 283). Remove pits in the 
face of a copper by laying it on some solid metal surface and 
pounding out the pits with light blows of a hammer. 
_ 2, Apply a flux.—After cleaning, it is necessary to protect 
the faces of the copper bit against the formation of additional

cleaned by filing. Immediately after cleaning therefore, apply 
a coating of flux to the faces of the bit. To do this, (1) rub

180 SOLDERING 
each face on a lump of sal ammoniac (muriate of ammonia), 
as shown in Fig. 284, or (2) apply some powdered resin (colo- 
phony) to the faces of the bit, or (3) roll the bit in some pulver- 
ized sal ammoniac, or (4) dip the copper bit in a solution of 
chloride of zine (killed acid). Commercial fluids or pastes, 
or certain of the other fluxes, might also be used. Muriatic 
acid should not be used. 
3. Apply the solder—After having coated the faces of the 
bit with some flux so as to prevent the formation of a copper

oxide, apply the solder. Rub each face with the bar of solder 
or, having melted some solder in a hollowed brick or board 
(Fig. 285) place the copper on the solder until it melts, and then 
revolve the bit in the melted solder. In either case, the solder 
should at once flow freely over the entire surface. When heat- 
ing the copper, do not heat it red hot, for this will burn the 
solder; however, if the copper is not hot enough, especially 
when using sal ammoniac, the bit will blacken and the solder 
will not stick. 
4. Wipe off the excess solder.—Wipe the copper with a 
piece of damp waste (Fig. 286) or dip it in sal-ammoniac water

(page 186) and then wipe it. The point of the soldering copper 
should now be completely tinned and ready for use. 
8. RETINNING SOLDERING COPPERS 
From time to time this covering of solder on the faces of the 
copper bit must be renewed, the frequency of its renewal depend- 
ing on. the use and care of the copper. With use, the tinning 
becomes thin, or, if the copper is overheated, it may be burned 
off. After a copper has once been put in good condition, the 
maintenance or renewal of the tinning does not require that the 
bit be filed each time as previously described. Such an “ iron ” 
may be retinned by either of the following methods. 
Using acid: 
Heat the iron and then dip it into chloride of zinc (killed 
acid), which will remove the copper oxide and, in turn, form a 
thin film of zinc. Immediately, apply the solder and it will 
adhere. Wipe off the excess solder. 
Using a brick: 
Select a soft brick, and with a cold chisel cut a shallow 
groove in it. Into this groove melt some solder and some 
resin (Fig. 287). After heating the copper (but not too hot, 
for a hard crust of burned resin is very likely to form on the 
faces of the copper bit if excessively hot), rub it back and forth 
through the melted solder and resin in the groove of the brick. 
The contact with the gritty brick polishes the copper, the resin 
protects the copper surface when cleaned, and the solder adheres. 
Wipe off the excess solder. This method will not remove burned 
spots from the faces of the bit. If soldering has been done with 
acid this method is not recommended. 
Whenever the copper is taken from the fire, dip the point into 
a bottle of sal-ammoniac water, and the zinc taken from the acid 
used when soldering (if killed acid is used) will run to the point

of the copper and can then be wiped or shaken off, leaving the 
copper bright. 
A soldering copper newly tinned is shown in Fig. 288, A. 
Compare the condition of the faces of these copper bits (Fig. 
288, A and B). . The copper shown at C is a new one, and, as

GENERAL INFORMATION 
Soldering is the process of joining similar or dissimilar metals 
by means of a combination, or alloy, of other metals, of which 
the melting point is usually lower than that of the metals to be 
joined. By alloy is meant the physical combination of two 
metals. Soldering operations are classified, according to the 
composition of the alloy used, as either soft soldering or hard 
soldering. Solders of low melting points, composed mainly ot 
lead and tin in varying amounts, are known as soft solders, while 
those of high melting points, composed of varying amounts of 
copper, brass, zine, silver, and gold are known as hard solders. 
The soft solder commonly used is made up of half lead and half 
tin, and melts at a temperature of 370° F. (Kent)! The more 
lead there is in this alloy, the higher is its melting point; and 
an alloy composed of 1 part tin and 2 parts lead melts at 441° F. 
(Kent)! Soft soldering is of greater interest to the average 
farmer, and therefore only this phase of soldering has been con- 
sidered in this book. 
DESCRIPTION OF SOLDERING OPERATIONS 
There are four main operations to be accomplished in any 
soldering work: (1) heating the soldering copper, (2) cleaning 
the surfaces to be soldered, (3) applying the proper flux to the 
cleaned surfaces, and (4) applying the solder with the heated 
copper.

1919. 
 
-P-A-G-E-201
DESCRIPTION OF SOLDERING OPERATIONS 183 
Heating the soldering copper. 
Assuming that its faces have been properly coated with 
solder (tinned), the soldering copper must be heated before 
being used. A copper may be heated over a coal or a charcoal 
fire, but undoubtedly the most convenient source of heat is the 
gasoline blow torch, which may easily be carried to the work 
to be done. 
After lighting the torch, the soldering copper should be 
placed in the brackets and heated. Judging the heat of a 
copper is a knack gained through practice. An experienced 
tinner will judge this heat by holding the copper near his cheek, 
while a beginner can judge only by trial. If solder melts readily 
when touched by the heated copper, it is an indication that the 
copper is sufficiently hot for ordinary use. 
Cleaning the surfaces to be soldered. 
If the solder is to obtain a firm grip, it must come in contact 
with the metal itself. There must be no dirt, grease, nor oxide 
between the metal and the solder. 
Most of the metals that the farmer is called on to solder are 
attacked by the oxygen from the air, the union of the metal with 
the oxygen being more rapid as the temperature of the metal is 
increased. This action of oxygen on metals is called oxidation, 
and the product formed by this union is known as an oxide. This 
affinity of the different metals for oxygen varies greatly; for 
example, the freshly cut surfaces of a piece of lead are 
very bright, but this luster is soon lost and replaced by the 
familiar dull appearance. As lead combines readily with 
oxygen, this thin coating of dull-appearing lead oxide forms 
quickly. The action of oxygen on tin is fairly rapid, but, 
because of the color of the oxide formed, its presence is not 
usually noticed. 
The fact that iron will rust, that is, that iron is attacked by 
oxygen and that rust, or oxide, is formed, is commonly seen and 
generally accepted; but the fact that all of the base metals, such
-P-A-G-E-202
184 SOLDERING 
as tin, lead, zinc, copper, aluminum, and the like are also 
attacked by oxygen, and that oxides are formed, is not usually 
recognized. It is true, however, that with most of these metals 
the formation of the layer of oxide protects the metal and pre- 
vents the further action of the oxygen, whereas with iron the 
rusting action continues to penetrate further and further into the 
metal. 
The main purpose of cleaning the surfaces to be joined is to 
remove this rust, or oxide. No one would think of soldering 
rusty iron without first removing the rust, and, similarly, none 
of the base metals should be soldered until the coating of oxide 
has been removed. Dirt and other foreign matter should be 
removed, as well as the oxide. 
The thorough cleaning of the surfaces to be soldered, being 
one of the most important operations in soldering, cannot be 
over-emphasized. For cleaning or removing the oxide (Fig. 
273, B), files, scrapers, emery paper, sandpaper and muriatic 
acid are commonly used. 
Applying the proper flux to the cleaned surfaces. 
In order to prevent the formation of additional oxide on the 
cleaned surfaces, both previous to and during the operation of 
soldering, some flux should be applied, immediately after clean- 
ing, to the surfaces to be soldered. As an oxide will form 
rapidly when the metal is heated by the copper, the presence of 
a flux, which will protect the metal being soldered from the air 
and which will not be vaporized by the heated copper, is abso- 
lutely necessary. In the discussion of the soldering of the 
different metals (pages 164, 176), the flux best adapted to each 
metal is named. 
Applying the solder with a heated soldering copper. 
With the point of the heated copper, some solder should be 
picked up and applied to the work. If the soldering copper is 
properly tinned and heated, the point will readily pick up solder
-P-A-G-E-203
FLUXES AND THEIR USE 185 
when drawn upward against the end of a bar of solder or of a 
strip of wire solder. The heating of the copper to just the right 
temperature for the metals being soldered, the manipulation of 
the copper, and the application of the proper amount of solder 
will come only through practice. 
Removing excess solder. 
The beginner is very apt, at times, to get too much solder 
on the work, or to drop solder where it is not wanted. This can 
readily be removed by applying a heated copper to this excess 
solder until it melts and begins to flow. Then remove the 
heated copper, and immediately wipe off the melted solder 
with a folded cloth or a bunch of cotton waste. It may be 
necessary to repeat this process two or three times before the 
excess solder is entirely removed, 
FLUXES AND THEIR USE 
When soldering, some preparation or material must be 
placed, immediately after cleaning, upon the surfaces to be 
soldered, in order to prevent the formation of an oxide previous 
to, and during, the operation of soldering. These preparations 
are known as fluxes. In addition to preventing the formation 
of an oxide, they make it possible for the solder to flow readily 
and to unite more firmly with the surfaces to be joined. The 
fluxes commonly used are muriatic acid (HCl), called “raw 
acid ” or “ straight acid”; chloride of zinc, called “ cut acid” 
or “ killed acid’; commercial soldering paste or a commercial 
soldering liquid; resin, or colophony; and muriate of ammonia, 
or sal ammoniac. Tallow is commonly used as a flux in solder- 
ing lead. Certain of these fluxes may be used on several metals, 
some, however, being better adapted for use on one particular 
metal than on others. 
Muriatic acid—Muriatic acid may be obtained at drug 
stores, and should be labeled and kept in some clean receptacle 
of glass or of some other material not corroded by the acid.
-P-A-G-E-204
186 SOLDERING 
When applying the acid, use a stick of wood as a swab. Do 
not allow the acid to come in contact with your hands, as it is 
sufficientiy strong to cause severe burns. Muriatic acid is 
used as a flux mainly in soldering galvanized iron or old zine. 
Chloride of zinc.—The preparation of chloride of zine is 
explained on page. 176. This flux may be used for soldering 
most metals except galvanized iron or old zine. 
Sal ammoniac.—Sal ammoniac, or muriate of ammonia, may 
be obtained either in powdered form or in lumps. It is used 
mainly, either in dry or liquid form, for keeping the soldering 
coppers in good condition. It is very seldom used as a flux for 
the actual work of soldering. Sal-ammoniac water, for clean- 
ing coppers, can be made by dissolving a piece of sal ammoniac 
about the size of a walnut in a pint of water. 
Soldering pastes——The commercial soldering pastes are 
usually compounds of several of the fluxes with tallow, olive 
oil, starch, or other materials to give the vaseline-like con- 
sistency of the finished mixture. One soldering paste is com- 
posed of tallow, olive oil, resin, and a saturated solution of sal 
ammoniac. It is evident, from the various fluxes combined in 
this paste, that it can be used on several metals. 
The one trouble with these pastes is that amateurs seldom 
handle them properly. It is usually harder to obtain a lasting 
repair with the average paste than it is with chloride of zine. 
As most pastes contain a fatty base, it is necessary to use a 
hotter copper, and to try out this grease, so that the fluxes in 
the paste become more available. More rubbing and working 
of the copper is therefore necessary than when a direct solution 
of acid is used. Being pastes, these fluxes are in a very con- 
venient form to handle. 
Resin.—The average layman unconsciously connects resin 
with soldering, and because it is a good flux for new tin—for it 
can be melted by the hot copper without evaporating, and it 
flows readily over the surfaces being tinned—he considers it a 
good flux for all metals. This it unfortunately is not, and its 
use as a flux should be confined mainly to new tin.

  EQUIPMENT FOR SOLDERING 187 
EQUIPMENT FOR SOLDERING 
The minimum equipment necessary for practically all of 
the soldering jobs of the average farm is shown in Fig. 287. 
For any soldering, a flux of some kind is necessary. The 
flux in the quarter-pint milk bottle mounted on a wooden block 
(Fig. 287, A) is muriatic acid, which is used mainly in soldering

as one pint capacity may be purchased, but for the average 
farm shop the one-quart size is as small as is desirable. By 
asing this torch and the homemade stove (Fig. 289), three cop- 
pers may be kept hot. 
The grooved brick containing melted solder and_ resin  
-P-A-G-E-206
  188 SOLDERING 
(Fig. 287, C) is for use in tinning a copper (Fig. 285, and page 
77). 
One or two 3-pound, straight-bit soldering coppers 
(Fig. 287, D) fit all ordinary needs. A copper smaller than a 
No. 3 is not desirable, especially on a farm where the copper is 
likely to be heated in the kitchen stove and carried some dis- 
tance to the work. 
Beside the soldering copper are shown (Fig. 287, £) two 
homemade cleaners, or scrapers. These are both made from 
old files which have been heated and bent, and then ground to a 
sharp edge while hot. These tools are very useful in preparing 
surfaces previous to applying the flux. In place of these, how- 
ever, an old pocket knife is a very good tool for cleaning sur- 
faces to be soldered. i 
In addition to this equipment, there should be a file for clean- 
ing the soldering coppers previous to tinning, tin shears for cut- 
ting material or patches, a bar of “ half and half ” solder, and 
some ribbon solder (Fig. 287, F, G, H, I). Ribbon solder is 
very convenient for small work. 
A homemade furnace (Fig. 289) is also convenient in solder- 
ing, for it is often desirable to have several coppers heating at 
one time. With a blow torch it is possible to heat one copper 
while using another, but there is no means of heating the two 
coppers if temporarily neither one is in use. 
POINTING COPPERS 
The bit of the copper should consist of four flat faces ter- 
minating in a point, as shown in Fig. 288,C. These flat faces 
make it possible for more of the copper to come in contact with 
the metal to be soldered than would a rounded surface as shown 
in Fig. 288, A, C. It is highly desirable to have a relatively 
large surface of contact between the metal and the copper, to 
facilitate the transfer of heat to the metal. 
If, through use, a soldering copper becomes rounded, it 
should be filled; if in very bad condition, it should be heatea

toa red heat and drawn to shape by hammering all sides equally. 
Care should be exercised in filing a copper to keep the surfaces 
of each face perfectly flat. Unless the file is drawn parallel 
with the face of the bit, a curved surface will result. When 
such a copper is used only its high part will touch the metal to 
be soldered, 
SOLDERING COPPERS

monly called, are made in two forms, the straight-bit type

(Fig. 288) and the hatchet-bit type. The straight bits made of 
copper, are shaped and pointed as shown, and are attached to a 
handle, usually with a wooden grip. The method of attaching 
the handle to the bit shown in Fig. 288, C is preferable to that 
shown in Fig. 288, A, for the handle of the latter is ‘very apt to 
become loose in the bit, thus allowing considerable play between 
the handle and the bit. Soldering coppers are sold by weight, 
the weight being given for two coppers. That is, a 4-pound 
copper means a pair of coppers each weighing 2 pounds. The 
proper heat for a copper varies according to the work in hand,

very little being required for work with lead or zinc, a medium 
heat for tin and iron, and a hot copper for work with brass and 
copper. When a copper is in use its heel, not its point, should 
be held in contact with the metal being soldered. 
THE GASOLINE BLOW TORCH 
Assuming that the source of heat is to be a gasoline blow 
torch such as that shown in Fig. 287 the first requirement is 
that this be filled with filtered gasoline. These torches are 
filled through a plug at the bottom. After partially filling the 
container, replace the plug, screwing it tightly into place and 
being sure that the washer is free from dirt or grit. 'Then pump 
up the air pressure by means of the air pump. The cup under 
the burner may be filled with gasoline directly from a container, 
or with gasoline from the torch itself. To fill it from the torch 
itself, hold the thumb of the left hand over the end of the 
burner and open up the gasoline valve, tipping the torch back 
toward the handle, so that the gasoline forced against the thumb 
will drip back into the cup beneath the burner. When the cup 
is almost full, turn off the needle valve and light the gasolitie, 
allowing it to burn until the cup is nearly empty. Then open 
the needle valve. The burner has been heated by the burning 
gasoline to such an extent that when the finely divided gasoline, 
forced from the torch by the air pressure, strikes the burner, it 
immediately vaporizes and ignites. The flame of the torch will 
maintain the heat of the burner. 
When the work of the blow torch is finished, it is best to 
release the air pressure. If this is done, the needle valve will 
not need to be closed so tightly in order to prevent the escape 
of gasoline. This is an advantage, as closing the valve too 
tightly when the torch is hot quickly ruins the needle. 
BLOW-TORCH TROUBLES 
In order that the blow torch may work properly, the holes in 
the perforated burner hood must be kept open, the torch must be
-P-A-G-E-209
  CONSTRUCTING HOMEMADE FURNACE 191 
supplied only with gasoline free from dirt, and all air leaks must 
be remedied. 
If the torch is burning and then goes out suddenly, but upon 
shaking or tapping will again burn well, the cause is probably 
dirty gasoline or carbon. All gasoline put into the torch should 
be strained, so as to be free from dirt. Examine the small 
gasoline feed passage at the needle valve, which is probably 
stopped up. Clean this, and refill the torch with strained gas- 
oline. 
Air leaks may occur in three places other than through holes 
or sprung seams in the container itself. The ball check in the 
pump, between the pump and the gasoline reservoir, may leak, 
resulting in gasoline being forced back through the pump. 
Either of the packing washers, one of which is at the filler plug 
in the bottom of the torch and the other around the pump barrel 
where the barrel is screwed into the reservoir, may leak. Care 
should always be taken, when replacing the filler cap or when 
screwing the pump barrel into place, to see that the gaskets are 
free from dirt or grit. This precaution greatly increases the 
life of these gaskets. 
At times it is impossible to pump any air. The plunger 
valve in the pump, being leather, must be kept well oiled and 
soaked in order that the pump work. A few drops of oil 
around the plunger rod will keep this leather in good shape. 
It will, of course, be necessary to renew this pump leather when 
it becomes worn. 
CONSTRUCTING A HOMEMADE FURNACE 
A homemade furnace, which is very simple in construction 
enables one to heat several irons at once, is shown in Figs. 289 
and 290. The length of this furnace is 14 inches over all. The 
pipe used is 2 inches in diameter, and the cut in the center 
of it is 3 inches long and 2 inches deep. The two vertical cuts 
are made with a hack saw, and the horizontal cut with a cold 
chisel, the pipe being slipped over another pipe which is held

    CHAPTER V 
PAINTING 
1. REPAINTING FARM TOOLS 
Operations: 
1. Clean all surfaces. 
. Apply the paint to the metal parts. 
. Apply the paint to the wood parts. ww 
Tools and materials: 
Metal scraper, one wire brush, one scrubbing brush for cleaning 
metal parts, one round 2 inch bristle brush, one putty knife, putty, 
metal paint (color desired), enamel paint for wood parts of tool (color 
desired), turpentine, and raw linseed oil. 
The repainting of tools consists of three operations: the 
cleaning of all surfaces, applying the paint to metal parts and 
applying the paint to the wood parts. The cleaning is all done 
at one time, then the metal parts should be painted first. It is 
better to buy a paint prepared for this particular kind of work. 
It is not necessary to take the tool apart, although some may 
prefer to do it. The main purpose of repainting tools is to 
brighten them up and preserve them. The temperature must 
be between 65° and 90° F. for paint to spread well. 
1. Clean all surfaces.—To remove the rust, scrape the sur- 
face with some type of metal scraper and then brush with a 
wire brush. If dirty, wash with water. After the surfaces are 
thoroughly dried, clean all metal parts with gasoline to remove 
any grease. Apply with stiff bristle brush and wipe off with an 
old cloth. 
To prepare new iron work on tools for painting, first wash 
194
-P-A-G-E-213
REPAINTING FARM TOOLS 195 
with gasoline, then sand off the rough spots, rewash and wipe 
dry. 
Use fine sandpaper to remove all loose paint and roughness 
from all wood parts. The smoother and cleaner the surface, 
the better the finished job will appear, and the less paint will 
be required. 
2. Apply the paint to the metal parts.—Stir well to be sure 
that all the paint in the can is well mixed. If the body of the 
paint is so heavy that it does not spread well, add turpentine to 
thin it. Apply the paint with the brush, and brush it out well 
on the parts, being ‘ 
sure that all are cov- 
ered evenly. Do not 
dip the brush too deep 
in the paint. When 
raising the brush from 
the paint, draw the 
end lightly across the 
edge of the can or pail 
so that the paint will 
not drip. It has been 
well said that a painter 
can be judged by the 
amount of paint he 
permits to drip on the 
floor or ground. Care 
should be exercised 
to get the paint in         ia ka a i

heads, nuts and rivets. 
If a second coat is required, wait until the first coat is dry 
before applying. Under favorable conditions this will be 
about twenty-four hours. 
3. Apply the paint to the wood parts.—Use prepared paint 
made especially for wood. Be sure that the paint is well 
mixed and the surface of the wood parts thoroughly dry. Thin   
    
-P-A-G-E-214

the paint with turpentine if necessary. If there are holes or 
checks in the wood, prime with raw linseed oil before painting. 
Let dry for about twenty-four hours and then fill the holes with 
some white lead putty. After which the first coat should be 
applied (Fig. 291). If a second coat is desired, wait twenty- 
four hours before applying it. Brush the paint out evenly. 
2. PAINTING NEW WOODWORK ON FARM TOOLS 
Operations: 
1. Prepare the surface. 
2. Put on the priming coat. 
3. Putty up all defects in wood. 
4, Put on the second or finish coat. 
Tools and materials: 
One 2-inch bristle brush, fine sandpaper, putty knife, white lead 
putty, prepared enamel paint for wood tools,! boiled linseed oil, and 
turpentine. 
1. Prepare the surface—Unless an exceptionally smooth 
surface is desired it is not the usual practice to prepare the 
surface of this type of woodwork by rubbing with sand paper. 
The planed surface of the wood is usually sufficient. 
2. Put on the priming coat——Mix the paint for use, as 
described on page 204. Make a priming coat by mixing two 
parts paint, one part raw linseed oil, and one part turpentine. 
Mix well and apply with a brush to the wood (Fig. 292). Brush 
well. Let dry for twenty-four hours before next operation. 
8. Putty up all defects in wood.—After the priming coat has 
been on twenty-four hours fill all holes or cracks in the wood 
with white lead putty which has been prepared as described on 
page 209. Press the putty in well with the putty knife and cut 
it off smooth with the surface. 
1 This job is best done with a prepared enamel paint for the wood part 
of tools, but this type of paint is not absolutely necessary.

  PAINTING NEW BUILDINGS 197 
4, Put on the second or finish coat.—While it is possible to 
paint over putty just put on, it is better to wait at least three 
to four hours before applying the second coat. Apply the 
paint and brush it out well. A third coat may be applied if 
    Fic. 292.—Applying the Primary Coat to a New Tongue. 
desired. The second coat should dry for twenty-four to forty- 
eight hours, depending on the temperature, before applying 
the third coat. 
3. PAINTING NEW BUILDINGS 
  Operations : 
1. Shellac all knots. 
2. Put on the first, or priming coat. 
3. Putty all nail holes and other small holes. 
4. Apply the second coat and trimming (if desired). 
Tools and materials: 
One flat, 6-inch bristle brush, one flat 4-inch bristle brush for 
cornice and door and window-casings, 1-inch bristle brush (round) for 
one shellac, one putty knife, prepared paint, turpentine, boiled linseed 
oil, ladders, hook for paint pail, wood paddle in pail. 
 
-P-A-G-E-216
  198 PAINTING 
1. Shellac all knots——With a 1-inch round bristle brush, 
cover all knots or gummy places (pitch spots) with one coat of 
orange shellac. This tends to keep the sun from drawing out 
the pitch and the knots from shrinking and dropping out. As 
the shellac dries quickly, one hour is sufficient time to wait 
before applying the paint. If the shellac gets too thick to 
spread well, thin it with wood alcohol. 
2. Put on the first or priming coat.—If a coat of paint is put 
on new wood, the oil is quickly absorbed. The pigment, stay- 
ing on the surface and having no oil to hold it, soon dries and 
falls off. 'To overcome this, the first, or priming coat, is mixed 
with an excess of oil. 
Buy a prepared paint from any reliable firm. Mix well as 
described on page 204 and add one quart of raw linseed oil 
and one pint. of turpentine or two quarts of raw linseed oil 
to the gallon for the first, or priming, coat. The first mixture 
will flow more freely when applying. Apply the paint freely to 
the surface with the 6-inch brush. Brush the paint out well, 
spreading it evenly. Be sure that one brushful laps evenly 
on to that put on before it. There is great danger of getting 
the laps so heavy that they show. 
In painting buildings, always start at the highest point 
and work down. Start at the eaves, then paint a strip across 
the building, then take a lower strip and so on until the bottom 
is reached. Use the small brush for cornice, casings, and other 
narrow surfaces. 
When painting a clapboarded surface, apply paint first to 
the lower edge of the clapboard, brush out well, then apply to 
the flat surface of the clapboard and brush out well. The edge 
of window and door casings next to the clapboards should be 
painted the same color as the clapboards. Then the different 
colored trim will come to a straight line along the outside 
corner of the casings. 
3. Putty all nail holes and other small holes.—Use a pre- 
pared oil or white lead putty. If the putty is too thin, add 
whiting to thicken it; if dry or hard, add boiled linseed oil. 
 
-P-A-G-E-217
PAINTING OLD BARNS AND OUT-BUILDINGS 199 
Knead until it works well. Press the putty into the holes with 
a putty knife and cut off smooth. Putty should always be 
applied after the priming coat is put on, or the wood will draw 
the oil out of the putty and it will fall out. This operation is 
usually omitted on barns and out-buildings. 
4. Apply the second coat and trimming (if desired).— Use the 
prepared paint as purchased, unless it is too thick to work well. 
If so, add turpentine sparingly to thin it and stir thoroughly 
to be sure all is mixed well. 
Begin at top of building as with the first coat, and work 
along the building and down. Brush out well, being sure the 
laps do not show. If using a trimming (color desired), for 
casings, cornice, etc., bring the two colors down at the same 
time. This not only saves time, but, since a ladder must not 
be put against wet paint, as it will mar the surface, it saves 
delays in waiting for the paint to dry. 
Sometimes, especially with white paint, three coats are 
required. With colors, two coats are usually sufficient. All 
trimming is put on only at time of last coat. Bring all down 
together. A third, or darker color is usually used on the sash. 
4, PAINTING OLD BARNS AND OUT-BUILDINGS 
Operations : 
1. Brush off loose paint and dirt. 
2. Apply the paint. 
Tools and materials: 
Same as Job 2 (new work), also one stiff 6-inch brush for cleaning. 
A brush broom is often used for this purpose. 
1. Brush off loose paint and dirt.—Brush off all dirt and 
loose paint. It is not necessary to remove old paint that is 
solid. 
2. Apply the paint.—Use a prepared barn paint. Thin with 
a mixture of equal parts of boiled linseed oil and turpentine, if 
necessary. Begin at top, painting the cornices first, and then 
   
-P-A-G-E-218
  
  200° PAINTING 
work along and down, as with new work. Brush the paint out 
well. Old work will require more brushing than new work. 
Keep the paint well stirred when using. A second coat may 
be added if desired. Wait forty-eight hours under favorable 
conditions before applying the second coat. 
5. PAINTING AN OLD HOUSE 
Operations : 
1. Remove all loose paint. 
2. Apply to all bare spots a coat of equal parts of paint and oil. 
3. Apply the paint. 
4. Paint the porch floors. 
Tools: 
Same as for Job 5, and steel scrapers, wire brushes, or blow torch 
to remove old paint. 
1. Remove all loose paint.—With a steel brush and putty 
knife remove all loose paint. If the surface is very rough, use 
a steel scraper. The steel brush is usually sufficient. If for 
some reason it is desired to remove the old paint that is solid, 
loosen it by heating with a blow torch (see page 190). Paint 
remover is too expensive for this purpose. 
2. Apply to all bare spots a coat of equal parts of paint and 
oil—For this purpose, equal parts of the paint to be used and 
boiled linseed oil are applied to all bare spots. This serves the 
same purpose as the priming coat on a new building. It is not 
necessary to apply it where the old paint is solid. Wait twenty- 
four hours before applying the next coat. If there are holes 
where putty is needed, but where the old paint is in good condi- 
tion, apply a coat of pure boiled linseed oil and putty the holes. 
3. Apply the paint—Use a prepared house paint of the 
desired color. Add equal parts of turpentine and boiled oil, 
if necessary to thin the paint. Usually one-half a pint of 
each to the gallon is sufficient. Apply the paint as in new work. 
 
-P-A-G-E-219
  GENERAL INFORMATION 201 
Put on the trimming at the same time the other paint is put 
on, or as the painter says, ‘“‘ bring them both down together.” 
One or two coats—usually one coat—will be sufficient. 
4, Paint the porch floors.—This is the last operation in 
painting the house. With a steel brush and a scraper, remove 
all loose paint. Then put on two priming coats. Use a pre- 
pared porch paint. To make the priming coat add one pint 
of turpentine and one pint of boiled linseed oil to each gallon 
of paint. Apply the first priming coat; brush out well. Then 
wait forty-eight hours before applying the second coat. Forty- 
eight hours after the second priming coat is applied, put the 
finishing coat on. Use the prepared paint as it is purchased. 
Brush it out well. The method described above applies both 
to old and new work. The ceiling is painted in the same 
manner as the rest of the house, though usually with a different 
color. 
GENERAL INFORMATION 
A gallon of paint will cover 350 to 450 square feet, the 
exact number of square feet covered depending upon whether 
the paint is used as a priming coat or a finishing coat, the 
condition of the wood, and how much the paint is brushed. 
The second coat covers more than the first, or priming, coat. 
Old work covers not over 250 to 325 square feet. 
Ready-mixed paints versus home-mixed paints. 
There are on the market many brands of ready-mixed paints 
for different kinds of work. The advantages of ready-mixed 
paints made by reliable concerns are that the color and shade 
can be selected as desired; the quality and color are uniform; 
and, as the paints are machine mixed, the ingredients are 
ground together in oil, the resulting mixture is generally 
better than can be made by hand. It requires considerable 
experience to mix and color paint by hand. The only advan- 
tage claimed for home mixing is that the quality of the materials 
used are known. ‘This is not entirely true, since the paint is
-P-A-G-E-220
202 PAINTING 
composed largely of white lead and oil, and these are as likely to 
be adulterated as is the ready-mixed paint. To be safe, 
purchase the standard. ready-mixed paints made by reliable 
companies. There is not much difference in cost between 
ready-mixed and home-mixed paints, especially if the time 
required to mix the paint is considered. Another disadvantage 
of the home-mixed paint is that a little more than needed 
must be mixed to be sure to have enough to complete the job. 
It is almost impossible to mix up a second batch and have it 
the same shade as the first. 
House paint and barn paint. 
Ready-mixed house or barn paint can be purchased. The 
house paint contains more white lead and is a better made paint. 
It has a smoother surface than a barn paint. The barn paint 
is a cheaper paint made for a rougher job on cheaper buildings. 
-A very cheap paint for rough buildings can be made of 
yellow ocher cut with turpentine and thinned with oil. Yellow 
ocher comes in powder form. Use about three parts of linseed 
oil (half-and-half boiled and raw) to one part of turpentine. 
First mix the ocher to a paste with equal parts of turpentine 
and boiled oil. Then thin with equal parts of boiled and raw 
oil mixed with turpentine, one part of turpentine to three parts 
of mixed oil. Stir well and let stand forty-eight hours before 
using. The color can be changed to any shade with burnt 
umber ground in oil or lampblack ground in oil. Mix with 
turpentine and strain through a varnish strainer before using. 
If a varnish strainer cannot be procured, use three thicknesses 
of cheese cloth. For red, use a cheap vermilion red in place 
of the ocher powder, 
Painting concrete. 
It is often desired to paint concrete walls. For this purpose 
buy a regular concrete paint for outside or inside walls or 
floors, as the case may be. While it is not necessary, it is
-P-A-G-E-221
GENERAL INFORMATION 203 
advisable first to go over the walls with a priming coat of boiled 
linseed oil, after brushing the surface clean, removing all dust 
and loose particles. Concrete paints may be thinned with 
kerosene. 
Care of brushes. 
To keep paint brushes soft and pliable, hang them in the 
paint up to the top of the bristles, being sure the bottom of 
the brush does not touch 
the bottom of the con- 
tainer. (Fig. 293.) They 
may also be hung in a 
mixture of equal parts of 
turpentine and raw linseed 
oil. It is a good practice 
to drill a hole in the handle 
of the brushes so that they 
may be slung on a wire and 
suspended in the keeping 
liquid. For short periods 
brushes may be kept sus- 
pended in water. 
If the paint brushes are 
not to be used for some 
time, they should be 
washed in turpentine or 
kerosene, then rinsed with 
gasoline, shaken out, then Fic. 293.—A Pail with Front Cut Away

to dry and later put away 
so as to be protected from dust. The gasoline “ kills ” the 
- turpentine and prevents the brush from getting stiff. 
Brushes used for shellac must be kept in, and cleaned with 
alcohol. Denatured grain alcohol is best, but wood alcohol 
will do. 
   
-P-A-G-E-222
  204 PAINTING 
Varnishing brushes should be kept in varnish, well covered 
to keep out all dirt or dust. Turpentine may be added to the 
varnish, in the proportion of one part turpentine to two parts 
varnish. To clean varnish brushes, use alcohol or equal parts 
of varnish and turpentine in a cup. Then wash with gasoline 
and lay away for future use. 
If a brush which has been cleaned becomes a little stiff, 
wash with gasoline before beginning to paint with it. 
If paint has been allowed to dry and harden in a brush, 
soak the brush in paint-remover, working the brush occasion- 
ally. Wash thoroughly with gasoline. 
Preparing ready-mixed paints for use. 
After opening the can, pour off almost all the liquid into 
another container. Then, with a wood paddle, mix the solid 
part left in the can until it becomes a soft paste. Then add the 
liquid that has been poured off and stir thoroughly. If the 
paint is then too thick to brush out well, thin it according to 
directions. 
Blistering. 
If paint is applied to any damp surface it will cause blistering. 
Even if the surface is apparently dry but the wood contains 
moisture and it is painted over, heat from any source will 
cause the paint to blister. Blistering may be caused by 
exposure to hot sun before the paint is dry, lack of sufficient 
brushing out, or the use of too much kerosene in thinning the 
paint. Another cause of blistering is the use of old raw linseed 
oil, which, having been exposed to the air, will oxidize and 
cause blistering. If an old oil is to be used, it should be heated 
to a temperature of 140° to 160° F. to take out the fatty 
ingredients. 
Crawling. 
Crawling is a term used by painters to designate a condition 
in which the paint will not stay brushed evenly over the surface.
-P-A-G-E-223
GENERAL INFORMATION 205 
This condition is most common when paint is applied to a 
greasy or glossy surface. Glossy or oily spots should be rubbed 
with fine sandpaper before paint is applied to rub off the gloss 
and thus prevent crawling. Sometimes, simply going over the 
surface with gasoline will stop crawling. Another cause of 
crawling is painting when it is too cold. The temperature 
should be above 50° F. Crawling is also caused by using a 
fatty oil (an old oil which has been exposed to the air). 
Painting hints. 
Before painting galvanized iron give it a wash of strong 
vinegar or gasoline. Wipe off and let dry before painting, as 
galvanized iron is greasy. Wash any iron with gasoline to 
_remove all grease before painting. Wash rusty iron with 
gasoline, then rub it with fine sandpaper to remove the rust. 
Then wash with gasoline before painting. 
One gallon of varnish will cover 550 to 650 square feet if the 
surface has been primed or filled. There are two kinds of 
varnish, flowing and brushing. Inexperienced persons shculd 
use a brushing varnish. Use a “badger hair” brush for 
putting on varnish, 
If paint contains too much oil, it will not adhere to the 
surface, but wili sag (not level out when brushed) or run. An 
insufficient amount of oil will cause paint to hang to the brush, 
to work hard and not be distributed evenly. By adding a 
little oil this trouble will be eliminated. 
Do not use an excess of drier; it will cause the. paint to 
work hard under the brush and chip and peel when dry. It 
also holds the oil from penetrating into the wood. There is 
usually enough drier in ready-mixed paint. 
Do not use a metal paint on wood; it does not penetrate, 
and it is likely to blister and peel off. 
A very important part of painting is brushing the paint 
out well so that it will be even. 
If too much turpentine is added the paint will streak.

Cautions: 
Be careful not to leave old paint cans or containers of paint 
containing lead where cattle can get at them, because they 
will eat the paint. The lead, zine, and boiled linseed oil, being 
poisonous if taken in sufficient quantities, will kill the stock. 
For the same reason, do not paint cow stalls, mangers, or 
barnyard fences with a paint containing these materials. - 
There are prepared paints on the market for this purpose. 
DEFINITIONS 
The following definitions have been adapted from definitions 
or descriptions given in Technology of Paint and Varnish by 
Sabin, and Circular 69 of the U. 8. Bureau of Standards. 
Paint: 
A mixture of pigment with a vehicle, intended to form a 
surface coating as distinguished from a dye or stain. 
Pigment: 
The suspended or solid substances in paints. Pigments are 
practically insoluble in the vehicle and they give the paint its 
body or color or both. If they are not naturally fine like lamp 
black they are made so by grinding. 
The various pigments in use may be roughly divided into 
(a) body pigments, those which constitute the bulk of the pig- 
ment present and given to the paint film its characteristic 
properties; (b) color pigments those which are used primarily 
to produce a decorative effect; (c) extenders, substances which 
have few if any of the properties required for body pigments, 
but which, on account of their cheapness, are added to paints, 
in many cases without harmful effect. 
Vehicle: 
The liquid part of a paint. 
Oil Paint is made of a pigment mixed with an oil vehicle, 
   
-P-A-G-E-225
DEFINITIONS 207 
usually raw linseed oil. To this is added from 5-10 per cent by 
volume of liquid dryer. 
Enamel Paint is composed of a pigment mixed with varnish 
as a vehicle. There is very little or no oil in an enamel paint. 
Enamel paint should not be thinned with oil, or, unless unavoid- 
able, with turpentine. If this type of paint is too thick, it 
should be thinned with spar varnish. 
Varnish: 
A liquid, not containing pigment, used for decoration or pro- 
tection and capable of being spread in a thin homogeneous film 
which will dry to a hard coating. 
Spirit Varnish: 
A varnish containing a resin (copals, dammar resin, rosin, 
lac) or a similar substance and a volatile solvent such as tur- 
pentine or alcohol. Shellac varnish is an example of a spirit 
varnish made of a mixture of the resin, shellac and alcohol. 
Shellac Varnish (commonly known as shellac or orange 
shellac) is, made by treating gum shellac with alcohol. If 
applied in a thin coat it dries very quickly, but if applied in a 
thick coat, it takes on a waxy consistency and is excessively 
slow about getting hard. It is naturally of an orange brown 
color, hence the term “orange shellac.” 
White Shellac is orange shellac that has been bleached with 
such an agent as chloride of lime. This is a delicate process, 
therefore, white shellac is likely not to be as durable as orange 
shellac. 
Oil Varnish: 
A varnish containing a resin or a similar substance and a 
volatile solvent together with a fixed or fatty oil (linseed oil). 
This is the more important class of varnishes. Examples of 
this class are floor varnish, interior varnish, spar varnish, rub- 
bing varnish, ete.

Linseed Oil is the oil obtained from flaxseed. Raw and 
boiled are the most important forms in which linseed oil is 
used by painters. Boiled oil is really a misnomer. The mod- 
ern way of manufacturing boiled linseed oil is to first make a 
very concentrated mixture by heating lead and manganese 
with raw oil. This material, known as crusher’s dryer, is then 
mixed with about sixteen times as much raw oil and the entire 
mixture is heated. The product is then known as boiled lin- 
seed oil. “ Bunghole ”’ boiled oil is raw oil to which a dryer has 
been added without heating. Since raw linseed oil contains no 
dryer it penetrates deeper into a wood surface than does boiled 
oil, but dries more slowly. 
Turpentine: 
A liquid produced by distilling the resin of pine trees usually 
the long-leaf pines of the southern states. It is probably the 
most important of the volatile thinners used in paints and var- 
nishes. 
Dryer: 
The term Japan dryer has come to mean a liquid compound 
of lead, manganese and linseed oil thinned with turpentine or 
benzine. Not only has dryer the property of rapid oxidation or 
drying but it imparts this property to paint, linseed oil or 
varnish. More than 10 per cent of dryer may be injurious to 
paint. In the preparation of ready mixed paint sufficient dryer 
is usually added. 
Yellow Ochre: 
A natural earth found in all parts of the world: deriving 
its color from the hydrated oxide of iron which it contains. 
When of good quality it is an excellent pigment as it works 
well with all vehicles and with other pigments. It is a perma- 
nent color.
-P-A-G-E-227
    REFERENCES 
Putty: 
Pure putty is made by kneading together whiting and 
pure linseed oil. Whiting is ground chalk. Putty may be 
colored by adding ochre, lamp black, etc., to give the shade 
desired. 
White Lead Putty: 
Pure putty with varying quantities of white lead added 
to make it stick better. White lead putty is not recommended 
for setting glass as it is difficult to remove when the glass is 
broken and a new pane is to be set. . If a putty is sticky, add 
whiting, if hard, add pure linseed oil.

     CHAPTER VI 
LEVELING 
Practically no construction would be possible without level- 
ing. It is employed in building, drainage, irrigation and many 
other kinds of work. 
In placing a stick of timber on supports for a building 
foundation, it is desired to so place it that when uprights are 
placed perpendicular to it they will be plumb, or, in other 
words, it is desired to have the timber level. If the stick of 
timber, or sill, as such a piece of lumber is called, were placed 
over a pond of water one could readily measure from the 
surface of the water to the top of the timber at several points 
along its length. If the timber were then blocked up until 
every point of its upper surface was an equal distance from 
the surface of the water, the top side of the timber would be 
level, because the surface of standing water is level and any 
line or surface parallel to the surface of standing water is a 
level line or a level surface as the case may be. 
In practice, however, it is not convenient to have standing 
water under a building foundation which is to be made level. 
The builder therefore makes use of some device or instruments 
for getting the timber level. 
1. LEVELING A TIMBER

B. Using a carpenter’s square and plumb bob. 
C. Using a hose.    210

LEVELING A TIMBER 211 
Tools and equipment: 
Carpenter’s square, plumb line and bob, carpenter’s level, lengin 
of hose. 
A. Using a carpenter’s level: 
The common method, in practice, of getting a timber level 
is by means of a carpenter’s level. Place this instrument upon 
the timber. Block the timber up until the bubble comes to 
rest in the middle of the bubble tube of the instrument. If 
the level is in proper adjustment (page 236) the timber will 
now be level. 
B. Using a carpenter’s square and plumb bob: 
Hold a carpenter’s square with the tongue pointing up on the 
timber and hold a 
plumb line along 
the edge of the 
tongue of the 
square to get it per- 
pendicular, as 
shown in Fig. 294. 
Block the timber 
up until the tongue 
of the square is 
parallel to the 
plumb line. The 
timber will be ap- 
proximately level, as a level line or surface is not only parallel 
to the surface of standing water but is perpendicular to a 
plumb line. 
As the square and plumb line are inconvenient instruments 
for this purpose, they are used only when a better means is not 
available.

C. Using a hose: 
Hold one end of the hose (Fig. 295) in a vertical position 
with the end even with the top of the plank at end A. Hold 
the other end of 
the hose in a ver- 
tical position with

same level at each end of the hose. If the water flows out of 
end A of the hose before it has risen to the top of end B, end 
A is lower; to make the plank level, end A must be raised. 
When the plank is level, and the hose is held and filled as 
directed, water will completely fill the hose to the level of the 
openings at each end.

each stake level with the top of the stake A, which is to represent 
the top of the foundation.

  LEVELING THE GRADE STAKES FOR A FOUNDATION 213 
A. Using a string and carpenter’s level: 
A method of getting a point on stake B level with top of 
stake A is to stretch a string taut from top of stake A to B. 
Hold a carpenter’s level either under or above the string and 
raise or lower the end of the string at stake B until the bubble 
indicates level when the string is parallel to either the top or 
bottom of the level block. Continue from stake B to the 
next and so on until all stakes are marked. In checking this 
work do not forget to change ends with the level. The car- 
penter’s square and plumb line could be used to get the string 
level, but they are inconvenient. 
B. Using a straight edge and carpenter’s level: 
The method more often used is to substitute a straight 
edge for the string. Select a board having one side perfectly

straight. If stakes A and B are not too far apart place the 
board called a straight edge against the two stakes with the 
top of straight edge even with the top of stake A, as shown in 
Fig. 296. With a level on top of the straight edge raise or lower 
end B until the straight edge is level then make a mark on stake 
B even with the top of the straight edge. Next move the 
straight edge to the next pair of stakes so that the end now at 
B will be at C, the next stake, and the end now at A will be at 
B. With the top even with the mark just made on stake B, 
 
-P-A-G-E-232
  214 LEVELING 
raise or lower end at C until the straight edge is level, then 
mark C as was done at B. Then proceed to the next pair of 
stakes. Continue this operation until all stakes are marked. 
If the distance between stakes A and B or any other two 
stakes is greater than the length of the straight edge, drive in 
temporary intermediate stakes. 
There are two methods of checking this operation for 
accuracy. (1) Continue the operation from the last stake 
marked to the starting point. (2) By changing ends with the 
straight edge and level together and repeating the operation. 
If the marks on the stakes the second time over consistently 
fall above or below those made the first time the level mark 
is halfway between them. 
C. Using a straight edge and carpenter’s square and plumb 
bob: 
Select a board having one side perfectly straight. Hold 
this board against stakes A and B as described under 2B. Hold

-P-A-G-E-233
LEVELING THE GRADE STAKES FOR A FOUNDATION 215 
Make a mark on stake B by drawing a pencil across stake B 
even with the top of the straight edge. This mark is level 
with the top of stake A. Proceed to the next pair of stakes. 
Continue this operation until all- stakes are marked. To 
check the accuracy of this work, repeat the operations, begin- 
ning with the last stake marked and work back to stake A. 
D. Using a hose: 
If a long garden hose is available, lay it on the ground from 
stake A to stake B and fill it with water, holding the top of 
one end in a vertical position level with the mark on stake A. 
Raise or lower the other end of hose held vertically beside

stake B, until the end of the hose is just even with the water 
inside. Then both ends of the hose will be level, as is indicated 
by the surface of the standing water inside the hose. Now 
mark stake B. Then move the hose to the next pair of stakes 
B-C and from B mark the next stake, and so on until all are 
marked. This can be made somewhat easier by putting a 
cork with a glass tube through it in each end of the hose as 
is shown in Fig. 298. The above described operation js called 
hose leveling. 
E. Using a carpenter’s level equipped with sights and tripod: 
To use a properly adjusted! level with sight for leveling 
the building foundation mentioned above, set up the tripod 
1See p. 231.   
 
-P-A-G-E-234
  
216 LEVELING 
and level near the foundation, or, better still, near the center 
of it. By means of the leveling screws in the tripod head, 
so adjust it that the bubble indicates that the instrument is 
level. Now the line of sight is, for practical purposes, a level 
line. When the level is swung around horizontally, a level 
plane is indicated by the line of sight. 
Hold a leveling rod on top of stake A. Look through the 
sights on the level and record the rod reading, or set a target 
on the rod at the point where the line of sight.crosses it. Next 
hold the rod on stake B and then slowly move the rod down 
along the side of stake B until the rod reading is the same as 
it was at stake A. Make a mark on stake B even with the 
lower end of the rod. Continue this operation on the other 
stakes. 
F. Using either a farm or engineer’s level: 
Proceed with this instrument exactly as described for the 
carpenter’s level equipped with sights and tripod. 
3. DETERMINING THE DIFFERENCE IN ELEVATION BETWEEN 
TWO POINTS 
(a) WHERE THE HORIZONTAL DISTANCE IS NOT GREAT

It is desired to find the difference in elevation between two 
points in a field. Drive a stake A at the place in question on 
the upper side of the field so that the top of the stake is 1 foot 
above the surface of the ground. The process of leveling will 
be the same as that just described for leveling the stakes for a 
building foundation, except that the stakes will be in a straight

proposed building. 
A. Using a straight edge and carpenter’s level: 
Drive a stake B a little less than the length of the straight 
edge from A in the direction the line is to proceed. Make a 
mark on this stake level with top of stake A (Fig. 299). Then 
drive the next stake, C, in the line and mark it. Continue 
until the last stake is driven at the desired place and marked. 
Measure down 1 foot from the mark on the last stake and 
make another mark which will be level with the surface of the 
ground at stake A. The distance from this last mark to the

ground is the difference in elevation between the two points in 
the field. Check the results by going back over the work in 
the direction of A. Reverse the direction of the straight edge 
and level. 
Imagine that the marks on the stakes represent the sur- 
face of a pond of water. At stake A the water is 1 foot deep 
and at stake D the water is 3} feet deep. The difference in 
elevation, then, between stake D and A is 2} feet. 
B. Using a carpenter’s level equipped with sights and tripod: 
Set up the carpenter’s level equipped with tripod and 
sights midway between the stakes A and D (Fig. 300). Hold a 
rod on top of stake A and record the rod-reading. Then hold 
the rod on stake D, swing the level in the direction of D and 
read the rod. Record this reading. The difference between

a little less than the length of the straight edge from A in the 
direction in which the line is to proceed. With the aid of the 
straight edge and level, determine the position of a mark on 
stake B level with the top of stake A. Drive stake C the 
necessary distance beyond stake B. Make a mark on stake B 
3 foot above the surface of the ground. Hold the straight edge 
against stakes B and C, having the top of one end even with the 
lower mark on B, and make a mark on C level with the lower 
mark on B. Continue this operation until the final stake F is 
reached. Make a mark on it } foot above the surface of the 
ground as was done with each former stake. Each stake except 
the first one will have two marks on it. The difference in ele-

“ ” It is desired to “run a line of levels”? over a distance of 
several hundred feet or, to put the problem in other words, 
it is desired to know whether or not it is possible to drain a 
certain low place ina field into a ditch or other low place at some 
distance away. If it is possible, how deep will the ditch have 
to be? 
First drive a stake or hub (Fig. 302) in the lowest place. 
Drive a witness stake near the’hub. Then at intervals of 25, 
50, or 100 feet along the line of the proposed drain put other 
hubs. This need not be a straight line. These hubs should 
uniformly project about 1 inch above the surface of the ground 
and should be about 2 feet one side of where the drain is to

be constructed. Witness stakes should always be placed near 
hub stakes to make it 
easy to find the hubs. 
Mark on the witness 
stake the name of the 
hub or station. Later 
the cut will be marked 
on these same stakes.

so on to the last one, F. 
Set up the instrument approximately halfway between A 
and B (Fig. 303). Level the instrument and read the rod 
at station A, which is 5.10 feet. Record this in the first 
line of the notes (Fig. 304) in the backsight column. It is 
called a backsight because the observer usually is looking back-

ward or in a direction opposite to that in which he is going. It 
is the reading taken at each set-up of the instrument on a point 
of known or assumed elevation. While this reading is being 
recorded the rodman proceeds to hub B where the rod is held 
while the instrument man after turning the instrument around 
reads the rod, the reading being 3.85 feet. This is a foresight 
and should be recorded (Fig. 304) in the second line opposite 
 
-P-A-G-E-240
    222 LEVELING 
station B in the column headed F.S. To get the difference in 
elevation between A and B subtract 3.85 feet from 5.10 feet, 
thus obtaining 1.25 feet. But as these intermediate differences 
of level are not needed, wait until the readings are taken on 
all the stakes, and then calculate the difference in elevation 
between A and Ff: The instrument man now moves the instru- 
ment and sets it up again midway between B and C, the reodman 
remaining at B. As soon as the instrument is leveled, take 
reading on rod at B, which is in this case 3.65. Now the rod- 
man goes to C while the backsight reading on B is being 
recorded in the notes opposite B in the backsight column. Then 
read the foresight on C, which is 5.00 feet. Record it in the notes 
in the F.S. column opposite station C. Move the instrument 
to a position midway between C and D, level it up and read the 
backsight on C, which is 3.80 feet. Record it in the notes in 
the B.S. column in line opposite station C. The rodman now 
goes to D, where a foresight is taken on D. It is 4.75 feet. 
Record it in the F.S. column of the notes in line opposite sta- 
tion D. Move the instrument to a position midway between 
D and E. Level it and read the backsight on D, which is 
4.05 feet. Record this in the notes in the B.S. column on 
line opposite station D.. The rod is taken to H, where the 
foresight reading is found to be 5.10 feet. ‘Record this in the 
F.S. column of notes on line opposite station H. Move the 
instrument to a position midway between H# and F. Level 
it and read the backsight on H, which is 3.75 feet. While it is 
being recorded in the B.S. column of the notes, the rodman 
takes the rod to station F', where it is held while the observer 
reads the foresight, which is found to be 4.15 feet. Record 
it in the F.S. column of the notes on line opposite station F. 
The field work is now completed. It is desired to know 
the difference in elevation between stakes A and F. The 
easiest way to get this is to add all the backsights and all the 
foresights and subtract the smaller quantity from the larger. 
The difference is found in this case to be 2.50 feet. To check

  DETERMINING THE CUTS BY COMPUTATION 225 
With the aid of an instrument obtain the readings on the 
hub stakes A through F inclusive, and record them in the notes 
as described on page 220. For convenience assume that the 
same stakes are used as in job 3C. This difference in eleva- 
tion between A and F' was found to be 2.50 feet. In other 
words, stake F is 23 feet’ below stake A. It is then possible 
to drain the water from A to F, as there is a fall of 23 feet 
in 250 feet, or 1 foot per hundred, which is a 1 per cent grade. 
It is also necessary to get a reading in the bottom of the 
ditch at the low side of the field. 
Station F is, in this case, on the bank of the ditch. By 
holding the rod in the bottom of the ditch and reading it from 
the last set-up, the depth of the ditch or the difference in 
elevation between it and the top of stake F can be found, 
by subtracting from this reading which, is in this case 6.25 
(Fig. 305), the foresight on F', which was 4.15.

  226 LEVELING 
1. Compute the elevation of the hub stakes.—The elevation 
of each stake or station can be obtained by subtracting the 
foresight from the backsight at each set-up of the instrument, 
but it is easier to assume an elevation for one of them and 
then calculate the others from it. As the work started at A 
and proceeded toward F in the field, do the same in reducing 
the notes. However, it would be just as well to give station F 
an assumed elevation and calculate the elevation of the other 
stations from it. Had it been desired to have the assumed 
elevation at the lowest point, it would have been easier for the 
beginner to start the field work at station F instead of A. 
Reduction of the field notes.— Referring to Figs. 303 and 305 
give station A an assumed elevation of 100.00 feet. As station 
F is 2.50 feet below station A, the elevation of station F will be 
97.50. Then:

  DETERMINING THE CUTS BY COMPUTATION 227 
This result checks with that obtained when the difference 
of elevation between station A and F' was subtracted from the 
assumed elevation of station A when the reduction of the notes 
began. 
2. Determine the depth of the ditch at the ends.—The 
depth of the ditch at the lower end is usually determined by 
the depth of the outlet ditch. Wherever possible, it is desirable 
to have a drop of at least 19 foot from the tile outlet into the 
open ditch. 
The difference in elevation between station F and the 
bottom of the ditch is 6.25—4.15 or 2.10. The elevation of 
station F is 97.50, therefore the elevation of the open ditch is 
97.50—2.10, or 95.40. The elevation of the tile outlet, to 
be 1 of a foot higher, should be 95.50. The elevation of hub 
stake F being 97.50, the depth of the ditch at the outlet 
end will be 2 feet. The fall between stakes A and F is 2% 
feet in 250. This grade of 1 per cent is sufficient for the 
ditch. Therefore, if the ditch is 2 feet deep at both inlet 
and outlet, the grade will be the same as between stakes 
A and F. 
3. Compute the elevation of the bottom of the ditch at the 
hubs.—The elevation of the bottom of the ditch at A is equal 
to the elevation of hub A less the cut of 2 feet. 100.00—2.00= 
98.00. The elevation of the bottom of the ditch at F is 97.50— 
2=95.50. The fall of the bottom of the ditch between A and F is 
2% feet, or a fall of 1 foot per hundred As the stakes are 50 feet 
apart, the elevation of the bottom of the ditch from A to B to C, 
ete., will drop } foot. Then subtracting from the elevation 
of bottom of ditch at station A (98.00) 4 foot, it will be found 
that the elevation of bottom at B is 98.00—.50=97.50; 
97.50—.50=97.00, elevation of the bottom of the ditch at C; 
97.00—.50=96.50, elevation of the bottom of the ditch at D. 
Continue figuring the elevation of the bottom of the ditch 
until F is reached (Fig. 305). 
4. Compute the cuts——Now subtract from the elevation of 
the hubs the elevation of the bottom of the ditch at the same

point. The difference in each case will be the cut in feet. Enter 
the cuts in the notes and mark the cuts on the proper witness 
stakes. 
5. DETERMINING THE CUTS AND GRADE OF A DITCH BY A

1. Determine the scale to be used in plotting.

distances.

Tools and equipment: 
Field notes, profile paper, ruler and pencil. 
A profile is a graphical method of representing a vertical 
section of the ground along the line of a proposed or finished 
drain. It shows not only the surface of the ground, but the 
grade line of the bottom of the ditch. By drawing a profile to 
scale, the cuts can be taken directly from the profile paper 
(Fig. 306). 
1. Determine the scale to be used in plotting —Owing to 
the fact that the horizontal distance is usually so many 
times greater than the vertical distance, a different scale 
is used for each. The use of two different scales will 
necessarily distort the relation between the horizontal and 
vertical distances, and the graph will appear out of propor- 
tion. 
The vertical scale is usually 1 inch=2 feet. With this 
scale each of the small vertical spaces will represent 0.10 feet of 
elevation and ten of them 1 foot. This makes it possible to 
read the depth of cut to the nearest twentieth of a foot, which

is as accurate as the bottom of a drain can be constructed. A 
larger or smaller scale could be used if desired. 
Any horizontal scale desired can be uséd. The greater the 
number of feet per inch, the less profile paper will be required. 
A very convenient scale is 25 feet for each space between the 
light vertical lines. This space may be 10 feet, as in Fig. 306, 
or it may be as much as 100 or more feet, depending on the 
length of the line. In any case select a scale such that each 
hub will come on a vertical line if the interval between them is 
uniform. 
2. Lay off on the profile paper the horizontal and vertical 
distances.—Across one end of the profile paper lay off the 
horizontal lines in feet. If the scale selected is 1 inch=2 feet, 
each two of the heavier horizontal lines will represent a differ- 
ence in elevation of 1 foot, as these spaces are each } inch 
apart on standard profile paper. As there are ten spaces 
between these two lines each small space will represent 0.10 feet. 
The elevation given to the bottom horizontal line should be 
below the lowest elevation used. In general, the lowest hub 
will be given an elevation of 100 feet. The bottom of the 
drain will then have elevations at the lower end below 100 feet. 
In this case, as in Fig. 306, it is well to give the second heavy 
horizontal line an elevation of 100 feet. Then mark the second 
horizontal line above this 101 and the second one below 99, 
and so on until each foot is marked. 
‘The spaces between the vertical lines on the standard profile 
paper represent the horizontal distance or the length of the 
drain and the distances between hubs. In this case it will be 
well to let the distance between each two vertical lines be 10 
feet in length, or to let ten of them represent 100 feet. Then 
every fifth line will be the position of a hub. Mark the vertical 
line used for the end of the profile 0, the eleventh 100 feet, 
the twenty-first 200 feet, ete. 
3. Plot the hubs.—Hub A will be on the first or o vertical 
line and on the horizontal line representing 100 feet elevation; 
hub B will be on the sixth vertical line, as it is 50 feet from A.
-P-A-G-E-249
  ADJUSTING THE LEVEL (BUBBLE TUBE) 231 
As its elevation is 101.25 feet it will be 2} spaces above the 
101 line. Continue until all hubs are plotted, then connect 
them with a curved line representing the surface of the ground. 
4. Plot the end elevations of the bottom of the ditch—As 
the drain is 2 feet deep at A, plot the bottom of the drain on 
the same vertical line, twenty spaces directly below A. As the 
drain is 2 feet deep at F, plot the bottom 2 feet or twenty spaces 
below F and on the same vertical line. 
5. Draw in the bottom of ditch.—With the aid of a ruler, 
draw a straight line connecting the points A and F' representing 
the bottom of the drain. 
6. Determine the cuts from the profile——The cuts at any 
point may now be determined by counting the spaces vertically 
between the straight line representing the bottom of the drain 
and the point representing the station or stake. Mark the 
cuts on the proper witness stakes. 
A profile will be found very convenient, not only for deter- 
mining the amount of cut, but to determine the best grade or 
grades, as the drain may require several different grades, 
especially if it is long and the surface grade changes consider- 
ably. The student should by all means practice making surveys 
and drawing profiles, as this is one of the greatest aids in laying 
out drains. 
6. ADJUSTING THE LEVEL! (BUBBLE TUBE) 
Two adjustments are necessary in order that the bubbles 
shall remain at the center of the bubble tube as the instrument 
is swung around and in order that the line of sight will be level. 
The first is the bubble tube adjustment, the second is the line 
of sight adjustment. Technically the purpose of the first 
adjustment is to make the horizontal axis of the bubble tube 
perpendicular to the vertical axis of the instrument, and the 
1 For a complete technical description of the adjustment of the level

Hosmer.
-P-A-G-E-250
    232 LEVELING 
purpose of the second is to make the line of sight parallel to 
the horizontal axis of the bubble tube. 
Operations: 
1. Set up the instrument. 
2. Adjust the bubble tube. 
Tools and equipment: 
Level (farm, engineer’s dumpy, or carpenter’s level equipped with 
tripod and sights), screw driver and adjusting pin. 
The adjustments of a carpenter’s level equipped with tripod 
and sights are the same as those for either the farm or engineer’s 
dumpy level. The method of making the actual adjustments 
will vary somewhat because of differences in. construction. 
For example, the method of attaching the bubble tube varies 
with the different instruments; thus, the actual method of 
raising or lowering one end of it will vary. On either the farm or 
engineer’s level the bubble tube is usually held in place by 
means of adjusting screws, while in the carpenter’s level the 
adjustable end of the bubble tube is held in place by means of 
either an eccentric or a screw or spring. In cheap carpenter’s 
levels the bubble tube is set in plaster of Paris in which case 
the bubble tube is not adjustable within the instrument, but 
for use on a tripod the adjustment may be accomplished by 
shimming up between the level and the level head. 
1. Set up the instrument.—Sce that the bubble tube is 
directly over one pair of leveling screws. Adjust the screws 
until the bubble comes to rest in the center of the tube, turn 
the instrument 180° (change ends with it) about the vertical 
axis. Then adjust the leveling screws until the bubble moves 
half way back to the center. Repeat this operation until the 
bubble remains in one position, no matter which way the 
instrument is pointed. Now the vertical axis of the instrument 
is truly vertical and it is ready for the actual making of the 
bubble adjustment. 
2. Adjust the bubble tube.—TIf the instrument in use is a car- 
penter’s level with an adjustable tube remove the plate over
-P-A-G-E-251
ADJUSTING THE LEVEL LINE OF SIGHT 233 
the bubble and raise or lower one end of the bubble tube, as 
described on page 236. If a farm or engineer’s dumpy level 
is used, raise or lower one end of the bubble tube by turning 
the adjusting screw with the adjusting pin. 
7. ADJUSTING THE LEVEL TO MAKE THE LINE OF SIGHT 
PARALLEL TO THE AXIS OF THE BUBBLE TUBE 
Operations : 
1. Locate the stakes. 
2. Set up the instrument midway between stakes and take 
and record readings. 
3. Set up the instrument near one stake and take readings. 
4. Make computations. 
5. Make the necessary adjustment. 
Tools and equipment: 
Level (engineer’s, farm or carpenter’s level equipped with sights 
and tripod), rod, stakes, ax, note book and pencil. (Adjusting pin 
when adjusting farm or engineer’s level.) 
The carpenter’s level with sights, the farm level, or even 
the engineer’s level may FE canstan-headed 
be out of adjustment. In serews 
fact, they probably never tenia 
are in perfect adjustment. 
By being out of adjust- 
ment is meant that the 
line of sight is not level or 
parallel to the axis of the 
bubble tube. It may be 
inclined upward or down- 
ward. Always use such 
instruments as if they pre. 307—Section through telescope of

    Cross wires 
 
-P-A-G-E-252
    234 LEVELING 
Here as for the bubble tube adjustment the actual making 
of the adjustment will vary with the instrument in use. The 
cross wires of the farm or engineer’s dumpy level are carried 
in a ring within the telescope (Fig. 307) and the whole ring 
is moved up or down by means of capstan-headed adjusting 
screws, while on the carpenter’s level the peephole and cross 
wires are separate attachments clamped on the level block 
(Fig. 313). 
1. Locate the stakes.—The amount that the instrument is 
out of adjustment can be determined by what is known as the 
“peg test.” Select a place where the ground is nearly level, 
drive two stakes, A and B, in the ground 200 feet or more apart. 
      Fia. 308.—Peg Adjustment Test. First set up. 
Even if the instrument is out of adjustment, the difference 
between the rod-readings gives the true difference of eleva- 
tion between A and B, if the instrument is set half way 
between them. : 
2. Set up the instrument midway between stakes and take 
and record readings.—Set up the instrument half way between 
the stakes and read a rod held on each stake (Fig. 308). The 
bubble should be in the center of the bubble tube when each 
reading is taken. Suppose the readings are, on A 4.56 and on 
B 5.68. These points where the line of sight hits the rod are 
level whether the line of sight is inclined upward or downward, 
because the inclination is the same in each direction. The 
difference between these two readings, 5.68—4.56=1.12—the 
true difference of level between the two stakes A and B,
-P-A-G-E-253
  ADJUSTING THE LEVEL LINE OF SIGHT 235 
8. Set up the instrument near one stake and take readings. 
—Now set up the instrument near or over one stake (Fig. 309) ; 
usually the one having the greater elevation, which in this 
case is A. Measure the distance from the top of stake A to 
the line of sight, center of telescope, which is found to be 4.50 in 
this case. Then point instrument in the direction of, and take 
the reading of, rod held on stake B, which in this case is found to 
be 5.82. 
4. Make computations—If the difference of elevation 
between the two stakes is 1.12 feet, stake B is 1.12 feet below A. 
The line of sight of the instrument at A (Fig. 309) is found by 
measuring tobe 4.50 feet above the top of the stake. Then if 
Line of Sight. 
  the line of sight is level or, as.we say, parallel to the horizontal 
axis of the bubble tube, the rod-reading at B should be 4.50 
plus 1.12 or 5.62 feet. On observation it was found to be 5.82. 
The line of sight is then inclined upward .2 foot in 200 feet or 
.1 foot per hundred. 
5. Make the necessary adjustment.—If the instrument is a 
carpenter’s level, raise the peephole sight by putting paper under 
it, until the rod-reading on stake B is 5.62. On the telescope 
of the engineer’s and farm level are screws which will raise or 
lower the cross wires, thus adjusting the line of sight. The 
beginner should not try te make the adjustments on the 
engineer’s or farm level until shown how by one who has had 
experience. If one performs the peg test on such instruments,
-P-A-G-E-254
  
  236 LEVELING 
he knows the amount of allowance to make for non-adjustment. 
As stated above for differential leveling, it does no harmif the 
instrument is out of adjustment, provided back and foresight 
of equal length are taken. 
8. ADJUSTING THE SPIRIT LEVEL (CARPENTER’S LEVEL) 
Operations: 
1. Check the level. 
2. Make the adjustments. 
Tools and equipment: 
Spirit level, screw driver, pieces of wood for blocking. 
1. Check the level—Place the level on a flat surface. 
Block up the lower end until the bubble comes to rest at the 
indicated center of the bubble tube. Then turn the level end 
for end. If the level is out of adjustment the bubble will come 
to rest not at the center but near the high end. 
2. Make the adjustments.—Remove the brass plate which 
is over the level bubble. At one end of the bubble tube is 
usually an adjusting screw. By means of this adjusting screw, 
raise the lower end of the tube or lower the high end of it (the 
bubble will be nearest the high end) until the bubble moves one- 
half the distance toward the center position. Repeat the test 
and adjustment until the bubble remains in the center of the 
tube when the position of the ends of the level has been reversed. 
In some of the cheaper levels there is no adjusting screw. If 
the block is wood, the bottom can be planed off. This is a 
delicate operation and should be attempted only by one who 
is an expert with a plane. Care should be exercised to see that 
the right end of the block is planed off. It is the end toward 
which the bubble comes to rest in the second position. Some- 
times a piece of paper can be placed under the end of the bubble 
tube. This is the only way to correct a level having an iron 
block when there is not an adjusting screw or other provision 
for raising or lowering one end of the bubble tube.

tube is so placed in a block of wood or iron that when the bottom 
of the block is level the bubble will 
stand between the two marks on 
the tube or in case of expansion or 
contraction due to changes of tem- 
perature will extend equal distances either side of them. 
Sometimes there is but one mark on the tube, in which case the 
mark will be over the center of the bubble when the instrument 
is level. 
  Fia. 311.—Bubble Tube. 
Use of the spirit level: 
Whenever a spirit level is placed on a timber or other surface 
and the timber blocked up until the bubble comes to rest at the 
desired position with respect to the markings on the tube, the 
level should then be turned end for end and replaced in exactly 
the same spot on the object in question. If the bubble comes 
to rest in the center of the tube when the level block is in either 
position, the surface is level and the spirit level is said to be in 
adjustment. If, on the other hand, the bubble does not come 
to rest in the center of the tube, as indicated by the marking, 
in both positions, the instrument is out of adjustment—.e., the 
horizontal axis of the bubble tube is not parallel to the bottom 
of the block. In this case the instrument needs adjusting, 
 
-P-A-G-E-256
  238 LEVELING 
although it is possible to use a level when it is out of adjustment 
by reversing it, and so blocking up the object to be leveled 
that the bubble will come to rest an equal distance from the 
center of the tube in either position. As a level is never in 
perfect adjustment and as it may get out of adjustment at any 
time, always assume that it is not properly adjusted—that is, 
always reverse the level. 
The farm level: 
A more convenient instrument than the carpenter’s level, 
where distances are 
considerable, is 
either the engineer’s 
level or the farm lev- 
el (Fig. 312). The 
latter which is much 
cheaper than the en- 
gineer’s level though 
less accurate is suf- 
ficiently accurate for 
most farm  opera- 
tions, such as drain- 
age, leveling, foun- 
dations for farm buildings, etc. These instruments combine 
the level sight with a telescope, bubble tube, level head and 
tripod. The telescope makes it possible to read the rod at a 
much greater distance than without it. The bubble tube is 
usually more sensitive than that on the carpenter’s level, thus 
insuring greater accuracy.     Fia. 312.—Farm Level.

This equipment consists of level sights. (Fig. 313) and 
a tripod head (Fig. 314) 
which can be purchased 
from any hardware dealer

pany, Bridgeport, Conn.). 
The tripod head is not 
absolutely necessary, but 
very convenient, as it be- 
comes a tripod or stand to 
hold the level when the 
legs are attached to it. 
One of the sights has in 
its center a small peep- 
hole; the other has a 
cross wire so placed that 
when one looks through 
the peephole the cross 
wire determines a_ line 
known as the line of 
sight.     ey Ys x

       240 LEVELING 
The leveling rod: 
There are several types of leveling 
rods on the market. For convenience 
they are figured in feet and tenths and 
hundredths of feet rather than in feet 
and inches, as the decimal scale is 
more convenient to use. A very good 
rod can be made by attaching a rod 
ribbon to a straight narrow board (Fig. 
316). Any rod may be equipped with 
a target. It is then called a target 
rod. SS 
Terms used in leveling: 
Elevation.—The elevation of a point 
is its distance above or below, usually 
above, some reference plane. This ; 
reference plane, called datum, is usually © 
mean sea level. When it is said that a iB 4 
certain point has an elevation of 865.5 : iq 
feet, it is understood, unless some other 
datum is given, that the point in ques- 
tion is 865.5 feet above mean sea level, 
mean sea level being the point of zero 
elevation. For ordinary farm leveling, 
the lowest point in the area in ques- 
tion is usually called datum, or the 
point of zero, or an assumed elevation. 
The starting point may be taken as 
datum, but if it is other than the lowest é 
point it is better to give the starting i 
point an assumed elevation of 100 feet. 1     ERS 
This will avoid any minus signs. That 
is, suppose in the problem, page 225, 
that stake A, which is our starting

point, is given 0.00 elevation and stake C, the second one from 
it, is found to be 0.10 feet below A. Then C would have an 
elevation of —0.10. But if A were given an elevation of 100 
and the difference of elevation between A and C were 0.10, 
- then C would have an elevation of 99.9 feet above the assumed 
datum. 
The spirit level is a round glass tube, the inside upper 
surface of which is slightly curved horizontally. The less the 
curvature the more sensitive the bubble. The tube is nearly 
filled with alcohol or ether, the remaining space forming the 
bubble which will always come to rest at the highest spot in the 
tube. This tube is the essential part of any leveling instrument. 
The carpenter’s level is often erroneously called simply a spirit 
level, as it consists of a spirit level or level bubble set in a block 
to make it convenient to use. 
A level surface is a curved surface, every point of which is 
perpendicular to the direction of gravity, as indicated by a 
plumb line. For example, the surface of still water is a level 
surface. For short distances a straight line is considered level. 
A level line is one which is parallel to a level surface or lies 
within such a surface. 
A horizontal line is a straight line which is perpendicular to 
the pull of gravity. 
A plumb line is a line freely suspending a weight. Such a 
line is in the direction of the pull of gravity and perpendicular 
to the surface of standing water. 
The datum is the plane of zero elevation, to which all the 
levels are referred. Mean sea level is generally used. For 
‘farm work the lowest point taken is usually given an elevation 
of 100 feet above an imaginary datum plane. 
The line of sight is an imaginary line determined by the 
optical center of the objective and the cross wires of the instru- 
ment. 
Backsight, or plus sight, is a reading taken on a point of 
known or assumed elevation, usually taken in a direction 
opposite to the directions of a line of levels. It is usually 
written B.S. 
 
-P-A-G-E-260
    
  242 LEVELING 
Foresight, or minus sight, is a reading taken on a point of 
unknown elevation, usually taken in the direction in which the 
line of levels is proceeding. It is usually written F.S. 
Bench marks are points, more or less permanent in charac- 
ter, the elevation of which is determined and recorded for . 
future use. These points are carefully described so that they 
ean be readily located when needed. 
*Turning points (usually written T.P.) are points on which 
both a foresight and a backsight are taken. They are less per- 
manent than bench marks, but solid enough to hold the rod. 
An insecure turning point may cause an error in the levels. 
Hubs are stakes driven down nearly level with the ground. 
They are really temporary bench marks (Fig. 302). 
Witness stakes are tall stakes driven near the hub stakes as 
“markers.” The name of the hub, or station, is recorded on 
the witness stake, with any other information, such as the 
“cut” or “fill,” etc. Stations may be named A, B, C, ete.; 
1, 2, 3, ete., or according to their distance apart, as the first 
one, 0+00; the next, 50 feet from it, as 0+50; the next as 
1+00, 1+50, ete. If the stakes are not a uniform distance 
apart the first would be 0+00; the next, which is 70 feet from 
it, would be 0-+70; the second, 235 feet from the first, would be 
2+35; the third, 275 feet from the first, would be 2+-75, ete.

around them (see Fig. 317). The surface of these areas is usually 
but a few inches below that of the surrounding land (Fig. 319).

the point at which the line of tile is to enter the outlet. Be 
sure that at this point the water will have a free passage and 
that there will be no danger of the water backing up in the 
line of tile. 
It is next desired to know whether or not there is sufficient 
fall between the area to be drained and this possible outlet. It 
may be that simple observation of the natural flow of water

will give this information. If not, the aid of a leveling instru- 
ment will be needed (Chapter VI). 
In general, a fall of 3 inches per hundred feet must be 
available. Under extreme conditions, however, a slighter fall 
may be utilized, provided a larger tile is used (page 246). 
While determining the difference in elevation between the 
wet spot and the outlet, take readings on the high and low 
points along the proposed drain, so that both the deep and 
shallow cuts can be computed. Estimate the length of the 
entire drain and the length of the deep cuits. 
2. Determine the size of tile to be used.—For a small wet 
spot, say, 50 to 200 feet in diameter, a 3-inch tile may generally 
 
-P-A-G-E-264
    246 3 FARM DRAINAGE 
be used, provided the length of the tile is not in excess of 
1000 feet. If the grade is less than 3 inches per 100 feet, or 
if the soil is of a texture that is liable to fill up the drains (quick- 
sand or silt) a 4-inch tile is preferable. For larger wet arcas, 
or for long runs of tile, the size should be computed as explained 
on page 257. 
3. Determine whether or not the spot can be drained 
economically.—The following factors under costs and benefits 
should be carefully considered and balanced against each other. 
(a) Costs: 
1. The depth of cuts. 
2. Length of drain. 
3. The size of tile. 
4. The kind of soil through which the ditch must be 
dug. 
(b) Benefits: 
1. Increased value of the crop. 
2. Improved appearance. 
3. Easier working of the entire field. 
4. Easier cultural operations. 
4. Stake out the ditch (for hand-digging) —Drive a hub and 
witness stake at the outlet and at intervals of 50 feet or more 
along the line of the proposed ditch. Locate these stakes about 
2 feet to one side of the ditch. Determine the elevation of 
each stake and the outlet, as described on page 220. Either by 
computation or profile, determine the grade of the ditch and 
the cut at each stake. Mark the cuts on the witness stakes. 
5. Dig the ditch.— With any method, it is usually the best 
practice to begin digging a drain at the outlet and work up 
grade. In case of rain or of water finding its way into the 
trench, it can then run out, thus doing a minimum amount of 
damage. For the smaller sizes of tile, the trench should be no 
wider than is necessary in order to work in it. This width 
varies from 10 to 15 inches, according to depth. It is very 
important not to excavate below grade.
-P-A-G-E-265
  DRAINING A SMALL WET SPOT 247 
If the ground is hard, the dirt must be loosened up with a 
pickax (Fig. 320). Often in loam soils that are not too dry, 
     Fig. 320.—Starting to Dig the Ditch, the Pickax is Used to Loosen the 
Soil. If the soil is neither hard nor stony a spade may be used. 
one can start with an ordinary spade and throw out the top foot, 
then with a round-pointed shovel throw out the loose dirt left 
by the spade (Fig. 321). With a drainage spade the remainder

of the dirt in a 3-foot ditch can be thrown out in two “ cuts,” 
down to within an inch or two of the finished grade. This can 
be readily estimated, as the exact cuts are given on the stakes.

In order to finish the bottom of the ditch accurately to grade, 
it is desirable to erect a string parallel to the bottom of the

between the cut and 5 feet (length of gauge stick) to allow 
for driving them securely in the ground. On the other side of 
the ditch, drive stakes opposite each stake just driven.

top of the hub stake and make a mark on the batter-board stake. 
Holding the top of the batter board flush with this mark, nail 
it to the stake. With the aid of a carpenter’s level, level the 
batter board and nail the opposite end to the other stake. 
Erect a batter board at each hub stake as just described (see 
Fig. 323). 
Stretch a string over the batter boards. This may be 
placed either over the center of the ditch or for convenience 
to one side. In the latter case a gauge stick with a cross 
piece must be used, and in checking the grade care must be 
taken to hold this level.
-P-A-G-E-268
  250 FARM DRAINAGE 
Finish the ditch to grade, checking the depth from the 
string with the aid of the gauge stick (Fig. 324). 
If the bottom of the ditch is not too hard or stony, the 
ditch may be finished with a drainage scoop (Fig. 325). This 
tool leaves the ditch 
| bottom rounded ready 
to receive the tile. 
6. Lay the tile— 
Draw the tile out to 
the field and string 
them along the ditch. 
It is usually the 
best practice to begin 
laying the tile at the 
outlet and proceed 
up the ditch. The 
tile may be laid from 
the bank with a tile 
hook (Fig. 326), or 
by standing in the 
ditch they may be 
placed by hand (Fig. 
Photo by U.S. Dept. of Agr. 327). Care should be

tained between two 
adjoining tiles. This is accomplished by turning the tile or 
changing ends with them. There will still be plenty of room 
for water to enter. No joint should be open more than } inch 
on the side or top. If it is impossible to avoid such an opening 
it should be covered with a piece of tile. Some men, when lay- 
ing the tile, stand on the tile already laid, driving each tile tight 
against those in line by giving it a backward kick with the heel 
of the shoe when it is placed. This makes a good tight joint. 
Others walk backward up the ditch, facing the line of tile. In 
soft, wet ground, tile should be laid on boards imbedded to

grade, as this prevents them from settling out of line. Be 
careful that the end of a tile and the end of a board do not 
come at the same place. The boards should break joints as 
nearly as possible at the middle of a tile. 
All badly shaped, soft, or cracked tile should be discarded. 
Do not throw them away, but use the pieces to cover joints,

etc. If the tile are well laid and carefully back-filled, the joints 
need not be given special protection. 
The tile at the upper end of the line should have a flat stone 
over the end (Fig. 328) to prevent animals from entering and 
dirt from washing in. When leaving the work overnight or for

any length of time, it is well to close the end of the tile with a 
board to keep out rain water and animals. ; 
A large curve can readily be made in the line from the 
average run of tile, by selecting tile having the ends cut on 
a bevel and laying the short ends in. If the curve is short, 
it will be necessary to chip the inside of the tile to make it fit; 
otherwise there will be large openings between the tiles on the 
outside of the bends. If the soil is one which will not readily

erode, it will not be necessary to fit the tiles by chipping, 
for the openings may be covered with pieces of broken tile and 
then carefully “ blinded.” 
7. Blind the tile-—The operation of covering the tile an 
inch or two deep, just enough to hold it in place, is called 
“blinding.” The tile should be blinded the same day it is 
laid. Ifa heavy rain should occur and this had not been done, 
much damage would be done to the bottom of the trench and 
the tile would probably have to be taken out, cleaned and 
 
-P-A-G-E-272
254 FARM DRAINAGE 
relaid. Blinding should be carefully done in order not to dis- 
place the tile. Surface soil should be used for this purpose. 
Blinding may be accomplished admirably by breaking in the 
shoulders of the ditch with a spade. 
8. Fill the ditch—Back-filling should be done as soon as 
possible after the tile is laid. The longer the excavated soil 
remains outside the ditch, the 
| : more compact it becomes and, 
ae therefore, the harder to move 
back into the trench again. 
The first step in back-filling is 
to cut the corners of the trench 
with a spade, letting them slide 
into the ditch. This operation 
is often done as blinding. 
It is very important in our 
clay subsoils that the surface 
soil be put over the tile, as it 
contains quite a bit of organic 
matter, thus affording an easy 
way for the water to get into 
the tile. After the two corners.

a drainage system. Surface water is liable to wash over the end 
of the drain and wash thé dirt away from the end length of tile, 
so that cattle may break them. To prevent this, the outlet 
should be protected by a bulkhead built of stone (Figs. 330 and 
331) or concrete. If there is a steep grade in the open drain 
beyond the outlet, the water shooting out of the drain is liable 
to cause serious erosion (Fig. 332). Under such conditions 
a concrete apron should be built beyond the bulkhead, or

1. Determine whether or not the draw can be drained.— 
There is usually no question as to the possibility of draining a 
draw, as there is practically always sufficient fall. 
A “draw ” is a term used by drainage men to designate a 
 
-P-A-G-E-275
  
DRAINING A DRAW 257 
depression extending into or through a field, forming a natural 
outlet for the watershed. 
Because of the fact that this draw (Fig. 333) is lower than 
the surrounding area, water has for years settled into it and has 
formed natural watercourses in the soil leading toward. the 
center or lowest part of the draw. Flood waters also naturally 
settle into and escape through this area. 
Such areas always remain wet later in the spring than the 
rest of the field, and in some seasons they are flooded to such 
an extent as to seriously injure or destroy the crop. Often such 
an area can be drained satisfactorily with a single line of tile. 
In constructing this line of tile through a main draw, it 
should be borne in mind that later this 
same drain may be made to serve as 
the main outlet drain for a natural 
system, as other smaller draws and 
isolated wet spots may from time to 
time be connected into it through 
submains or laterals (see Fig. 334). 
2. Determine the size of tile to be 
used.—Since a line of tile to drain a 
large draw must be of a sufficient size 
to carry a considerable amount of NATURAL SYSTEM 
water from the draw itself and also Fig. 334.--The Drain is 
of sufficient size to accommodate the Placed through the 
laterals which later may be led into Draw. From time to 
it, it is very important that the proper oe ean eats! 
size be carefully computed. ee 
The main drain should not be designed to have a capacity 
equal to the combined capacity of the submains and laterals, 
but should be designed to carry the water from the entire 
watershed at a given rate. When calculating the size of a sub- 
main, treat it as a main for the area which it drains. 
The first step necessary in computing the size of this tile is 
to determine by the aid of a level (page 220) the available fall 
of the drain that may be installed (Fig. 333). 
     
-P-A-G-E-276
258 FARM DRAINAGE 
The next step is to determine the area of ‘and which natur- 
ally drains into this draw. The extent of this area in acres 
can be estimated by talking with people familiar with the 
region. 
The next step is to determine how much water must be 
removed from this area every twenty-four hours in order to 
prevent water from accumulating to such an extent as to 
injure the crop or interfere with cultural operations. 
The rate at which the water will accumulate will depend 
upon the amount and distribution of rainfall, porosity of the 
soil and such characteristics of the watershed as steepness 
and kind of vegetation, whether cultivated crops, pasture, or 
woods. 
The rate of run-off or the amount of water which must be 
removed from the watershed is called the ‘‘ drainage coefficient.’’ 
It is expressed in terms of inches of water in depth to be re- 
moved in a twenty-four-hour period—e.g., if it is desired to 
have a drain large enough to remove } inch of water from 
the entire watershed, the drainage coefficient would equal 
$4 inch. The drainage coefficient usually used varies from } 
to 2 inch. 
In general, where the annual rainfall is not over 30 inches, a 
coefficient of { inch is not unreasonable, while a 40-inch rainfall 
would require a coefficient of at least 4 inch. In the eastern 
United States, where the rainfall varies from 28 to 36 inches, the 
drainage coefficients most commonly used for farm drainage 
vary from } to} inch. In the central United States, where the 
rainfall varies from 34 to 38 inches, the coefficient common for 
farm drainage is 33; to $ inch; while on the Pacific slope, with 
an annual rainfall of 36 to 40 inches, a coefficient of 4 to 4 inch 
is common. These are general figures and are given only to 
show about what the average coefficient is! The coefficient 
for any section can be obtained from your college of agriculture.

for Land Drainage,” by C. G. Elliott, published by John Wiley & Sons,

This diagram was prepared by the Division of Rural Engineer-

in cubic feet, given in feet and decimals. On the right-hand 
side are three columns giving the number of acres drained at 
various rates of run-off, marked R=}, R=, and R=}. From 
' these can be found the other drainage coefficients—e.g., if a 
coefficient of + inch is used, double the quantity given for 3 inch. 
The solid diagonal lines give the size of tile required under 
various conditions. To use the diagram locate the number 
of acres to be drained in the right-hand column having the 
desired coefficient, then follow the horizontal line opposite this 
quantity to the left until it meets the vertical line above the 
slope in feet per hundred feet. The solid diagonal line above 
this point of intersection gives the size of tile to use. 
Example 1.—What size of tile having a fall of 4 foot per 
hundred will be required to drain a 50-acre watershed? Sup- 
pose that after carefully considering all the factors involved it is 
decided that a coefficient of + inch will be used. On the 
bottom of the diagram (Fig. 335) will be found the slope in feet 
per hundred feet. Locate the vertical line above .5 in column 
marked R 4, and find 50 acres drained. Follow the horizontal 
line to the left until it meets the vertical line above .5 slope in 
feet per hundred feet. This point of intersection is between an 
8-inch tile and a 10-inch tile. The 10-inch tile is the size to 
use as the 8-inch will be too small. 
Example 2.—What size of tile having a fall of 1 foot per 
hundred feet will be required to drain a watershed of 40 acres 
when the run-off is ¢ inch in twenty-four hours? 
As there is no column showing the acres drained where 
R is }, double the quantities given in column R $ or divide the 
area to be drained by 2 and use column R}. In column R } 
find 20 acres, follow the horizontal line to the left until it meets 
the vertical line above 1-foot slope in feet per hundred feet. 
This point of intersection is nearly on the 6-inch line. There- 
fore a 6-inch tile is the size to use. 
In case of heavy continuous rains there are times when the 
water cannot pass through the soil and into the drains as fast as 
it accumulates. In this case it will accumulate and run over the 
 
-P-A-G-E-279
  DRAINING A DRAW 261 
surface for short intervals. If the soil is one which will readily 
wash or the crops are such that they are quickly injured by 
standing water, either surface drains or inlets should be 
provided. 
If the calculations indicate that the size of tile required 
for a particular job is midway between two obtainable sizes— 
for example, if a 63-inch tile is required and only a 6- or a 7-inch 
can be purchased—the correct practice is always to select the 
larger size of tile. It often happens, however, that because of 
the expense involved it is desired to use the smaller size and 
care for the excess water during spring or other times of heavy 
rain through a surface relief drain. Under such conditions the 
smaller size of tile could be selected. If, on' the other band, 
a catch basin (see page 288) is installed to take care of the 
surface water, the larger-sized tile should always be selected.

small amount of drainage under average conditions. Roughly 
stake out the line of the ditch and then, with a team and plow 
(usually a walking plow), turn at least four furrows each way 
from the line of the ditch, leaving a dead furrow where the ditch 
is to be dug. Now plow back and forth several times in the 
bottom of the ditch until as much dirt is plowed out of the ditch 
as possible. This last operation will be facilitated by spreading 
the horses (Fig. 337), using a long evener.

Next, with a round pointed shovel, throw out all the loose 
dirt. Then with a drainage plow, if available (Fig. 336), 
loosen up more of the bottom of the ditch and throw out the 
loose dirt with a shovel. Continue this operation until the 
ditch is nearly deep enough. 
If the grade is slight and it is felt that grade stakes are 
necessary, they should be put in after the excavation has been 
completed to within 6 inches of the bottom of the ditch (see 
Job 1). Had they been put in earlier in the operation they 
would have been in the way of plowing.

INTERCEPTING DRAINS 
Side hills are usually kept wet not by direct rainfall, but by 
seepage. On wet side hills there is usually a hard stratum 
underlying the 
more or less porous 
surface soil. The 
water finds its way 
down into this 
porous layer and, 
not being able to 
go through the hard 
layer, follows it, 
appearing where

DRAINING A SIDE HILL 265 
water flows for any length of time, they are called springs. In 
many cases, water seeps out for some distance along the face of 
the hill or may be more or less localized into wet places along the 
hillside. These places will usually be about on the same level. 
On hillsides or quite. rolling land, whether kept wet by a 
general seepage across the entire slope or by localized springy 
spots, it is usually the best practice to place the drains across 
the slope. 
The free soil water in this rolling ground is moving down the 
slope. If the drains are placed up and down the slope in the 
direction in which the water is moving, they will not effectively 
drain the soil except for a few feet on either side. The water will 
continue to move down the slope between the drains. If the 
drains cross the slope they will cut the water off before it reaches 
the surface, as does an eaves-trough before the roof water 
reaches the ground. It is not uncommon for a single drain thus 
located to take the excess water from an entire field or hillside. 
DRAINS FOR SPRINGY SPOTS 
If the soil is kept wet by a springy spot and this spring is 
localized, a single drain may be run along the shortest course 
possible between spring and outlet, even though it be directly 
up the slope. At the spring it is usually advisable to build a 
cavity of stone at the end of the tile (Fig. 340) in the bottom of 
the spring. This will serve as a sort of collecting basin for the 
water. 
When the springy place is of a more general nature, say, 
two or three rods across, it is the best practice to cross the slope 
with a drain just above the wet area. This area is kept wet 
or springy by water moving through a porous layer, coming to 
the surface. A drain thus installed will cut off the water before 
it reaches the surface of the ground. 
It often happens that on a side hill or quite rolling ground 
there is a series of these wet areas or springy spots. It will 
usually be noted that they are about on the same horizontal 
line. In other words they are caused by water seeping out at 
   
-P-A-G-E-284
ee ee en. err enor errr Te 
266 FARM DRAINAGE 
various points from the same porous stratum. It is not 
uncommon to so locate a single drain above these wet areas 
that it will intercept the water before it reaches the surface. 
Sometimes it is necessary to put a second drain below the first, 
if the first cannot be placed deep enough to get all the water, 
as there may be a second porous, water-bearing stratum below 
the first.

ground, they can be drained unless the soil formation is so rocky 
as to make the construction of the drain impractical. 
2. Determine the size of tile to be used.—As this type of 
drain is nearly always less than 1000 feet long, the grade is 
practically always 6 inches per hundred feet or more, and the 
volume of water to be carried is not great, 3-inch tile are usually 
used. In extreme cases where large quantities of water are 
involved, 4- or even 5-inch tile are used.

3. Determine whether or not the side hill can be drained 
economically.—The factors to be considered are identical with 
those discussed under Job 1. 
4. Stake out the drain—As this type of drain is along the 
side of a hill, it will usually not be necessary to use a level 
unless there is doubt as to whether thé ditch will have a fall of 
at least 6 inches per hundred feet If the wet area or areas 
are all about the same elevation, it may be necessary in extreme 
cases to lay the drain on a grade of as little as 4 inches per 
hundred feet for the upper 200 to 300 feet of the drain, after 
which the grade should increase to at least 6 inches per hundred 
feet, although a minimum of 12 inches would be preferable. 
The method of leveling will be the same as given on page 220. 
In general, however, it is necessary only to stake out roughly 
the line of the drain, being sure that with ordinary drain tile a 
grade greater than 15 to 20 feet per hundred is not used. 
5. Dig the ditch—The ditch may be dug by either the hand 
method (page 246) or the hand-and-horse method (page 261). 
Usually there is sufficient grade to make the use of grade 
stakes and batter boards unnecessary.

1. Determine whether or not the area can be drained.— 
The first step in determining whether or not such an area can 
be drained is to definitely determine if there is an outlet. 
  Fia. 341.—A Gridiron System. The main drain is in the background. 
This is accomplished either by simple observations or with the 
aid of a level. If, adjacent to the field, there is an outlet drain — 
the bottom of which is 24 to 3 feet below the lower end of the 
field, drainage can be accomplished by a herringbone system 
(see page 269), even if the field is level. If, however, the field 
has a gradual slope of not less than 3 inches per hundred feet 
toward this drain, it can be more cheaply drained by installing a 
gridiron system (see above). If there is no such outlet ditch 
adjacent to the field, it will be necessary to determine with the
-P-A-G-E-287
  DRAINING A NEARLY LEVEL AREA , 269 
aid of a level where an outlet may be obtained. The lowest 
point in the field may be determined by observation or by inquiry 
as to where the flood water leaves the field, or it can be deter- 
mined by setting up a leveling instrument and taking rod- 
readings at several of the lowest appearing places. From the 
lowest point in the field, run a line of levels as described on 
page 220 and endeavor to find a suitable outlet. Between the 
low point in the field and this outlet there should be a fall of at 
least 1 inch per hundred feet. If this fall is not available, the 
area cannot be drained by ordinary methods. 
2. Select the kind of system to be installed —F lat or gently 
sloping areas are usually drained by a system of parallel drains, 
  Q@RIDIRON SYSTEM

usually laid in the direction of the greatest slope. If this 
nearly level area sloped in one direction (Fig. 341) there 
would, of course, be a main across the lower side of the 
area. The laterals would be brought into the main. This 
would be a “‘ gridiron system.” (Fig. 342,A.) Of course, these 
laterals could empty into an open ditch instead of the main. 
Unless the expense of a tile main is prohibitive, it is undesirable to 
permanently run the laterals into an open ditch, because of the 
large number of outlets needing attention. The gridiron system

is the most economical arrangement of drains on flat areas, as 
it requires less tile per acre than do the other flat-land systems. 
If the area to be drained slopes gently from both sides to

Fia. 343.—Herring Bone System Installed. 
the center (Fig. 343) it will be necessary to locate a main 
through this lowest place and lead the laterals to it from 
each side. We then have 
what is known as a “ herring- 
bone system” (Fig. 342, B). 
This is not as economical as 
the gridiron system, on ac- 
count of what is termed 
“ double drainage.” The main 
drain will drain an area of say, 
30 feet on each side of it, as 
indicated by cross-hatching in 
Fig. 342, B. The laterals, 
which are 40 feet apart, will 
drain an area of 20 feet on 
each side of them, as indi- 
cated by  eross-hatching. 
Then, where laterals enter 
the main, there is double 
drainage, indicated by the 
double-hatching. A few feet at the lower end of each lateral

  DRAINING A NEARLY LEVEL AREA 271 
have no other function than to conduct water to the main. 
If the nearly level area is kept wet by seepage from an adjoining 
hillside a single intercepting drain, installed as shown, in Fig. 
344, will usually drain the entire area. 
3. Determine the depth of and distance between drains.— 
The depth at which lateral drains are placed will depend upon 
the texture of the soil. In humid regions, drains 2 feet deep are 
shallow and 4 feet deep are deep. In soils of a dense structure, 
such as clay or clay loam, the usual practice is to place drains 2 
to 2} feet deep. For these soils the rule is to place 2 feet of dirt on 
top of the tile. In soils of a permeable structure, such as those 
of the Middle West, drains should be 4 feet deep. In soils 
that are kept wet by water coming up from below, drains are 
often placed 6 to 8 feet deep. 
The spacing of lateral drains will depend upon the character 
of the soil, the “lay ”’ of the land, and the value of the crop. 
For good drainage, in clay to clay loam soils, drains may be 
placed from 30 to 40 feet apart; in clay loam to sandy loams, 
40 to 60 feet; in gumbo to heavy clays having a granular 
structure, 70 to 80 feet; sandy soil with a sand or gravelly 
subsoil, 100 to 200 feet. 
Whether or not tile can be placed economically at the above- 
listed intervals will depend entirely upon the crop which can 
be grown on the field to be drained. In general, however, one 
should decide, if possible, what interval the crop which might be 
produced will warrant. For example, in some regions the crop 
may warrant drains 35 feet apart; but if it is not desired to install 
all the drainage in any one year, one should keep this desirable 
interval in mind, thus spacing the drains 70 feet to 100 feet 
apart so that the intermediate drains can be ultimately installed. 
It is recommended that the reader communicate with his 
college of agriculture to ascertain the recommended practice for 
depth and spacing of drains for his region. 
4. Determine the size of tile necessary.— The main.—The 
size of the main should be calculated on the basis of the area 
drained and the fall, as described on page 258.  
-P-A-G-E-290
   
     
272 FARM DRAINAGE 
The laterals.—Ordinarily, lateral drains carry but a small 
part of their full capacity, and the aeration afforded by the 
extra capacity is no small part of their value in the soil. They 
are the collecting drains or feeders to the mains. As they 
usually receive little or no surface water, their size does not 
depend upon the amount of water to be carried. Owing to the 
danger of the tile getting out of line, the danger of silt or sand 
tending to stop them up, and the relatively small extra cost, the 
smallest tile that is now considered advisable for laterals is 
3-inch. 
If the grade is less than 3 inches per hundred feet or over 
1000 feet long, 4-inch or 5-inch tile should be used. These 
larger sizes of tile should be used if the soil.contains quicksand, 
silt, or other fine material liable to find its way into the tile, 
and also for very deep drains. 
5. Determine whether or not the field can be drained 
economically.—In determining whether or not the field can be 
economically drained, one must balance the cost against the 
benefits. The cost depends upon cost of tile, cost of construc- 
tion, length of main, and kind of soil to be cut through, while 
the benefits consist of the increased value of the crop, ete. 
(see Job 1). 
6. Stake out the drains.—(a) If the grades are perfectly 
apparent and the surface uniform no leveling will be necessary. 
Simply dig the main about + foot deeper than the laterals, or 
enough to allow for the extra size of tile. 
(b) If, on the other hand, the grades are less than 6 inches 
per hundred feet the grades and cuts of each drain should be 
carefully calculated (page 225). Stake out the main, drive 
the hub and witness stakes 2 feet to one side of the ditch 
at 50-foot intervals, beginning at the outlet. In like manner, 
stake out each lateral. Obtain the elevation of each stake and 
determine the grades. Draw a profile of the main (page 
228), and each lateral; draw in on the profiles the bottom of the 
laterals. Plot the elevation of the bottom of each lateral on the 
profile of the main; then draw the bottom of the main on the

GENERAL INFORMATION 
Principles of drainage.—The principal function of artificial 
drainage is to remove the excess water from the land as quickly 
as possible. 
There are three kinds of water in the soil, of which the drain- 
age man recognizes two: (1) capillary water and (2) gravita- 
tional or hydrostatic water. The capillary water is that which 
forms a thin film about each soil particle, producing what we 
commonly term a moist soil. This is the water used by plants. 
Gravitational water is that which occupies the pore spaces in 
the soil or stands on the surface. It is the water which changes 
a soil from moist to wet. Plants do not use this water. In 
fact, it is detrimental to their growth as it occupies the space 
that should contain air. A drainage system should be so 
designed as to remove this excess water before the crops suffer 
injury, and should not be so elaborate that the crops grown 
cannot pay for the investment in a reasonable length of time. 
The question is often asked, ‘‘ Will removing this excess 
water make the soil drier during a period of drought?” Not 
only is the answer ‘‘ No,” but it should be added that, on the 
contrary, well-drained soil will retain moisture much longer 
during drought than will a poorly drained soil. The gravita- 
tional water found in poorly drained soil is not only useless to 
plants, but if allowed to remain in the soil will cause the soil 
to become puddled or the particles to be worked close together, 
thus producing a condition favorable to evaporation. As a
-P-A-G-E-293
GENERAL INFORMATION 275° 
result, evaporation will remove not only the gravitational 
water, but also the capillary water which the plants want. 
As a matter of fact, one will always find the soil over a drain 
more moist during a period of drought than that farther away 
from the drain. This is, of course, not due to the drain itself, 
but the condition produced—vz., the soil is in better phys- 
ical condition, and thus holds the capillary water instead of los- 
ing it by evaporation. ‘ 
Land needing drainage.—It was formerly the general belief 
that only land upon which water actually stood was in need of 
drainage. It is now quite generally understood that such a 
condition means, as a rule, that either the surface soil is so 
flat that the water cannot run off or the subsoil is so impervious 
that it cannot soak in. Evaporation is then the only natural 
means by which the water can disappear. This process is not 
only too slow for agricultural purposes, but also tends to 
reduce the temperature of the soil. As a matter of fact, soil 
may be very wet without any water apparent on its surface, 
as in the case of a piece of very rolling ground which is kept 
wet by seepage. It is not uncommon to find a pocket in the 
subsoil, on level or rolling ground, which is holding back the 
water that keeps the surface soil above wet. There are also 
low places in comparatively, level land, into which the surface 
water settles. 
Kinds of drainage.—All methods of drainage which remove, 
as quickly as possible, the surface water and the free water 
from the root zone of the soil, leaving only the thin film of 
moisture coating the soil particles, may be divided into two 
general classes, viz., (1) open drains and (2) closed drains. 
Open ditches.—These include all depressions in the ground 
through which water flows. These ditches are often very 
little more than plow furrows, and even though they are large 
they do not remove the water from the subsoil, since the soil 
along the banks becomes packed and the ditches are often too 
shallow. The bank on either side forms a natural path for 
men and animals. When performing tillage operations, it is 
 
-P-A-G-E-294
  276 FARM DRAINAGE 
necessary to turn when the ditch is reached; thus the soil and 
subsoil become packed, and thus the movement of the free 
water from the soil into the open ditch is prevented. Under- 
ground or tile drains do not offer a natural barrier; thus the soil 
does not become abnormally packed near the tile. Open 
ditches not only cut up the fields, but also harbor weeds and 
hinder the use of improved machinery, and increase the cost of 
cultivation by causing extra labor. They also cause the waste 
of a strip of land 10 or more feet wide, and demand constant 
attention and frequent renewal or cleaning, thus increasing 
the expense of maintenance. The growth of weeds in these 
ditches tends to retard the flow of water, thus causing the 
ditches to fill up. 
If open ditches are used, they should be located, wherever 
possible, along the line of field divisions, and they should be as 
straight as possible. It is better to have them wide, with 
very sloping banks, so that one can drive across them and cut 
the weeds easily with a mower. 
Underdrains.—The practice of covering drains is a very old 
one. It is believed that the ancient Roman farmers knew and 
used the art. The first underdrains were open ditches with 
brush, poles, or stones laid in the bottom and covered with 
earth. Any of these types of drains are effective (Fig. 346) and 
as good as tile, as long as they continue to operate. The 
principal objection to them is the shortness of their life, which 
is due to the fact that mice and other animals burrow into them 
and thus block them. Certain soils which will readily erode 
tend to fill this type of drain. On the other hand, stone drains 
have been observed that have been in operation for seventy- 
five years. Let it be clear at this point that these long-lived 
ones are the exception and not the rule. The use of such 
drains was, of course, much more practicable years ago than now, 
as good drain tile can be readily purchased now at a com- 
paratively reasonable figure in most sections of this country. 
Tile drains.—Tile drains are the same as any other under- 
drain or “blind ditch,” except that the water is conducted

through short lengths of pipe instead of through a throat built 
of wood or stone. These pipes are usually made of clay or 
concrete. 
In America, the first drain tile were laid in New York State, 
two or three miles southeast of Geneva, by a Scotthman 
named John Johnston. In the year 1835, Johnston imported 
hand-made horseshoe-shaped tile from his native land. At that

time it was the opinion of his neighbors that the water, percolat- 
ing through the soil and out through the tile drains, would 
leach all the fertility out of his land. But, much to their 
surprise, the wheat crops on this clay soil were increased 10 to 
25 bushels per acre. In 1851 there were 16 miles of tile drain 
on the Johnston farm, and they are all still working. 
How water gets through the soil into the tile——In the early 
days of tile drainage it was generally supposed that water 
entered a tile drain through the walls of the tile. Thus it 
 
-P-A-G-E-296
  278 FARM DRAINAGE 
seemed best to use the most porous tile possible. It was later 
learned that, even with a very porous tile, over 90 per cent 
of the water entered through the joints. It can easily be 
determined that water does not readily pass through the walls, 
by plugging one end of a tile, standing it on the closed end, 
and filling it with water. Even with the most porous tile, only 
a very small amount will soak through the walls. Since 
practically all the water enters through the joints, 1-foot 
lengths of tile are used, so as to provide more joints. 
After a tile drain has been in operation a few years the soil 
condition becomes readjusted. Watercourses are formed 
leading toward the drain. This is due to the action of earth 
worms, plant roots, frost action, alternate wetting and drying, 
etc. For this reason it is often said that after a tile drain has 
been in a few years it “ draws farther,’ which, in a sense, is 
true. The heavier the soil, the longer it takes for a drain to 
reach its maximum efficiency. In a heavy clay, a drain con- 
tinues each year to remove water from the soil faster and 
from a greater distance laterally, for at least five years. In 
a light soil it will probably do as well as ever the second year. 
KINDS OF DRAIN TILE 
There are two general classes of agricultural drain tile: 
clay and concrete. Clay tile may be further classified accord- 
ing to hardness: 
Clay tile: 
1. Common 
(a) soft-burned 
(6) medium-burned 
(c) hard-burned 
2. Vitrified 
3. Glazed 
The difference in the three grades of common tile is due to the 
degree of heat to which they are burned. Some clays will 
 
-P-A-G-E-297
  KINDS OF DRAIN TILE 279 
not stand burning at a temperature sufficiently high to harden 
them properly. These soft tiles are porous—that is, they read- 
ily absorb water, which is apt to make them crumble if they 
freeze. If this grade of tile is left outdoors on the ground 
over winter, subject to freezing and thawing, the chances are 
very small that the tile will be found whole in the spring. 
If, however, they are laid in the ground and-do not freeze, 
they will last as long and operate as well as any tile. The 
porous quality is of no special advantage and it may be a 
decided disadvantage. 
It is well to see that there are no lime spots in the tile. 
If limestone pebbles were originally in the clay and have 
found their way into the walls of the tile, they will form quick- 
lime when the tile is burned. Then, when it becomes wet, this 
quicklime will expand and burst, disintegrating the tile. The 
medium- and hard-burned tile seem to stand the test better, 
although there is some frost injury to the medium-burned tile. 
This tile is also generally known as porous tile. 
The vitrified and glazed tile are usually made of a mixture of 
two or more clays or shales of different textures. This mixture 
will stand burning to a heat great enough to melt some of the 
material and cause it to run together. A tile wall impervious 
to water is the result. Glazed tile differ from vitrified tile in 
one respect. When the glazed tile is in the kilns and has been 
heated to a high degree, salt is added.: This salt blends with the 
surface, forming a thin molten compound which flows over the 
surface, giving it a glassy appearance. Some glazed tile and 
sewer pipe are made of fire clay. 
Concrete tile: 
Although concrete tile have only recently come into use, 
they are already used extensively in some sections. When 
properly made and cured, they have proved satisfactory in 
certain parts of the country. If the reader contemplates using 
them, the authors recommend that he communicate with his 
state college. Well-made concrete tile are built of good, clean 
     
-P-A-G-E-298
  280 FARM DRAINAGE 
sand and a good Portland cement, in the proportion of 1:3 
or 1 : 4, depending on the grade of sand. The concrete should 
be well mixed and as wet as possible. Then the tile should be 
properly cured—that is, allowed to dry out slowly, preferably in 
a steam curing kiln. Exposure to sun and wind, while curing, 
will render the best tile worthless. Concrete tile have been 
used for so short a time that it is impossible to say whether or 
not they will last as long as clay tile. Failures have occurred 
in clay tile, as well as in concrete tile. Concrete tile are 
cheaper than clay tile, especially in the larger sizes. Another 
argument in their favor is the fact that concrete tile can be 
made on the farm. They are generally more uniform in shape 
than are clay tile. The arguments against them are as follows: 
the smaller sizes are no cheaper than clay, if the cost of labor 
is considered; porous walls are apt to disintegrate, owing to 
frost action, soil acids, alkalies, etc.; there are too many factors 
to consider in making good tile, such as good sand, proper 
mixture, slow drying, etc.; and much more depends on the 
honesty of the manufacturers than in the case of the clay tile. 
Shape of tile-—There has been great improvement not only 
in the quality of drain tile, but in their shape as well. The 
first tile made in this country were called horseshoe tile because 
of their shape (Fig. 346). It is probable that the tile were thus 
shaped for ease in molding rather than for any supposed 
advantage in having bottoms opened. In field practice it was 
necessary to lay the tile on boards, which proved to be an 
expensive operation. Moreover, the boards decayed and 
allowed the tile to get out of line, unless in a very hard, clay 
soil. Later the machine was perfected, with the result that 
clay tile could be molded without an open side. One side was 
made flat, to prevent the tile (called single-sole tile) from rolling 
over while being laid, and also to hold them in place while 
drying in the process of manufacture. This form of tile made 
the board foundation unnecessary. It was found that the 
single-sole tile, like the horseshoe tile, offered but two possi- 
bilities of a good joint—+.e., the tile could be laid either way 
 
-P-A-G-E-299
  KINDS OF DRAIN TILE 281 
round. This class of tile is still put out by a few manufacturers. 
It is quite generally the practice to disregard the flat side in 
laying them, since it is more desirable to have a good joint 
than to have the tile rest easily on the flat side. 
The next development was the double sole, which made it 
possible to turn the tile over as well as to use either end, thus 
allowing for four chances of getting a good joint. Then the 
idea was conceived that, if a round or hexagonal tile were made 
it would always be possible to turn the tile in such a way as to 
get a good joint. A few square tiles were also made. The 
common practice among manufacturers at present is to make 
either a round or a hexagonal tile, according to the demand of 
their trade. In the opinion of the authors, either the round 
or the hexagonal is a desirable shape. Which of the two is the 
better is a matter of personal taste, there being no distinct 
advantage of one over the other. The one that you, person- 
ally, like best is the one to lay. 
The bell and spigot tile (page 440) were not made for land- 
drainage purposes. However, seconds can sometimes be 
purchased at a figure that justifies their use. The collars do 
no harm and they may be of value in holding the alignment of 
the tile in soft places, such as muck or quicksand, or on very 
steep grades. The joints should not be packed as in laying 
sewer pipe, for experiments have shown conclusively that most 
of the water enters a tile drain through the joints. Thus 
1-foot lengths have an advantage over 18-inch or 24-inch 
lengths, because there are more joints through which the 
water may enter. It is desirable to use the longer lengths for 
sizes over 10 inches. The sizes of tile are designated as 3-inch, 
6-inch, etc. The numbers refer to the inside diameter of the 
tile, without regard to the thickness of the wall. 
Junction tile are made by some manufacturers. These 
resemble Y’s and T’s, depending on whether the branch enters 
the main at an angle or perpendicularly (Fig. 347). The Y 
should always be used, as the water in the branch, upon 
entering the main, will then flow in the same direction as that

in the main. FARM DRAINAGE 
If it enters perpendicularly, as is the case in 
the T fitting, the incoming water interrupts the flow of that

ing it. 
Making a junction 
with land tile.—It is not 
necessary to buy these 
junction tile, but they are 
often convenient. Little 
skill is required to make 
a junction with three tile 
(Fig. 348). In each of 
two tile, taken from the 
main drain, cut out a 
semicircular notch by hitting them on the end with a light 
hammer or by chipping with a 
wrench (Fig. 349). Then cut 
the branch tile to fit this open- 
ing made in the main by the 
two notches. This joint should 
then be covered and packed 
with small stone and pieces of 
broken tile (Fig. 348). It is 
well to cover with a sod be- 
fore back-filling. This home- 
made junction is commonly 
covered with concrete. Al- 
though this is a good practice, 
it is sometimes dangerous, for 
if the concrete is a bit too 
thin, it will run through the 
joint into the tile, thus causing 
a stoppage. There have been 
eases where enough concrete 
has found its way between the tiles to completely plug the 
line. 
    Fig. 348.—A Junction Made of 
Three Common Tilc. The main 
is 6-inch tile, the lateral is 
4-inch tile. 
If concrete is used, it should be a very dry mixture.
-P-A-G-E-301
  METHODS OF CONSTUCTING DITCHES 283 
Moreover, back-filling should not be begun until the concrete 
has entirely hardened. 
Making a turn with land tile—Curved tile are manu- 
factured, although usually as a sewer pipe, these curves 
being known as one-eighth and one-quarter bends. These are 
not ordinarily needed, for enough tile without square ends 
can usually be found to go a long way toward making a turn. 
In the first place, a sharp turn is undesirable, and it is there-

fore necessary to make the turn as long as possible. In lay- 
ing it, put all the long sides of the untrue tile selected on the 
outside, then leave the outside of the joints open and the insides 
closed. The open part of the joints may be covered with pieces 
of broken tile. 
Protecting the joints.—In the early days of drainage in this 
country it was common practice to cover the tile with straw, 
leaves, or sawdust to keep the soil from entering the tile through 
the joints; in later years, strips of burlap were laid over the 
 
-P-A-G-E-302
  284 FARM DRAINAGE 
joints; later, heavy paper, such as tar or building paper, was 
used instead of burlap; and finally several thicknesses of 
ordinary newspaper were used. If, in laying the tile, great 
eare is exercised to roll or change ends with the tile, so that 
when placed tight together a good joint is secured, and if the 
tile are then blinded with surface soil, silt or sand will not 
enter the tile after the soil has readjusted itself to the new 
condition. For this reason, the practice of protecting joints 
other than by blinding with surface soil (see page 253) has been 
discontinued, except in quicksand. In case of such soils, 
every precaution must be taken to protect the joints. When 
tile are laid through quicksand, they should be placed on 
boards, the joints covered with paper or burlap, and then 
blinded with the surface soil. Sod from a surface soil, free 
from quicksand and containing a large amount of organic 
matter, placed over the joints and then blinded with surface 
soil, is also very satisfactory. The organic matter will act as a 
strainer, allowing the water to pass through, but: holding the 
quicksand or silt back. If possible, put a tile through quick- 
sand at the time of the year when the quicksand is dry. 
Methods of constructing ditches: 
1. By hand or the pick-and-shovel method. (See Job 1.) 
2. By hand with the aid of a team and plow. (See Job 2.) 
3. By horse-drawn ditchers. 
4. By traction ditchers. 
8. Horse-drawn ditchers.—The next type of drainage ma- 
chinery is the large, horse-drawn, double mold-board plow, 
earried on three wheels, the front one running in the ditch with 
the two rear ones on either side (Fig. 350). The plow is raised 
and lowered by a hand wheel to regulate the depth of cut and 
to maintain a comparatively uniform grade in places where the 
surface is irregular. As the machine is not capable of making 
the entire cut at one time, it must be driven back and forth 
over the ditch, taking a few inches at a time. The amount 
 
-P-A-G-E-303
KINDS OF DRAIN TILE 285 
* of cut made each time depends on the hardness of the ground, 
amount of power, presence of stones, and other factors. Very 
satisfactory work has been done with these machines, especially 
in cases where the soil is comparatively free from stones and 
the surface fairly regular. From six to ten horses are required 
to draw the machine. For this reason it works more economi- 
cally in places where the drains are long, because of the incon- 
venience of turning. A tractor has been used to operate such 
ore TR

a machine with fairly good results. Troubles are sometimes 
encountered, however, due principally to a lack of footing for the 
tractor after a certain amount of the dirt had been thrown 
out on the banks of the ditch. It seems advantageous to use a 
tractor as long as it has good footing, then finish the job with 
horses. In using a tractor, it is important to have a break pin 
between the tractor and the ditcher, to prevent breaking the 
machine when it comes in contact with a solidly imbedded stone 
or large root. 
 
-P-A-G-E-304

4. Traction ditchers.—For this type of construction, grade 
stakes are put 18 inches to the right of the ditch and 100 to 200 
feet apart, and the cut marked on the witness stake. The power 
ditcher (Fig. 351) is unquestionably the best in constructing tile 
drains where there are not too many stones. With this ma- 
chine it is possible to keep an almost perfect grade. It also 
leaves the bottom of the ditch in good shape to lay the tile and 
keep it in line. Moreover, it is much the quickest method of

construction, as the whole job is done at one operation. But 
at present in many sections the initial cost of construction is 
greater when using the power ditcher than by the other methods. 
Nevertheless, the fact that more ditching can and will be put in, 
more than offsets this extra cost. It should be remembered, 
however, that if the draining of a field is delayed because of 
this extra initial cost in using a machine, the chances are that 
the work will not be done. This means that the farmer will 
suffer a financial loss each year the land is wet.

SURFACE INTAKES 
  AND SILT BASINS 287 
SURFACE INTAKES AND SILT BASINS 
In low places, or at the end of a tile drain where water is 
brought in by an open ditch, water often accumulates over the 
drain faster than it can 
pass through the soil into 
the tile. In such cases it 
is necessary to build surface 
inlets. These surface inlets 
must be constructed in such 
a way as to prevent rubbish 
from being carried into the 
drain. The stone “sink” 
is one of the most common 
ways of letting water into a tile drain (Fig. 352). 
  Fia. 352.—A Stone Surface Inlet. 
This is 
built by filling the trench around and above the tile with field 
stones of various sizes. If constructed at the end of a drain, 
the stones around the open end of the tile should be of such a

that the rods are parallel to the direction 
of the flow of the water. size that they will not 
enter the drain, nor 
block the entire opening. 
The largest stones 
should be placed around 
the tile and the smallest 
ones near the surface. 
Another type of sur- 
face inlet is the concrete 
box built in the tile line. 
This type is used es- 
pecially in places where 
a large quantity of water 
is to be handled. The 
top of the box is an inch 
or two below the lowest Note 
point on the surface of the surrounding land. The opening in 
the top of the inlet box should be covered with a screen; a box  
-P-A-G-E-306
  288 FARM DRAINAGE 
screen, or grating, is best, having the bars parallel to the flow 
of the water (Fig. 353) so that the force of the flowing water 
will carry debris past the screen. If this concrete box is built 
deeper than the outlet, it becomes a silt basin as well as a 
surface inlet. This is true because the flow is broken here and 
the silt allowed to settle. 
If a silt basin is necessary, it should be large enough to 
allow a person to enter it to shovel out the sediment (Fig. 354). 
  
    
    
  
    
      
      
  
  Fig. 354.—Silt Basin. 
This would mean a box 3 feet wide and 4 or 5 feet long. These 
silt basins are often necessary in drainage systems in soil con- 
taining silt or quicksand. A silt basin is usually placed at a 
point where a fairly steep grade suddenly flattens out, or at the 
junction of two or more lines of tile, especially where the grade 
of the outgoing tile is less than that of the incoming drains. 
Types of wet spots: 
There are three types of wet spots usually encountered in 
drainage work: 
1. Wet spots from seepage and springs. 
2. Depressions in surface soil on flat land. 
3. Depressions in the subsoil. 
 
-P-A-G-E-307
  TYPES OF WET SPOTS 289 
1. Wet spots from seepage and springs.—The draining of a 
wet spot and spring on a side hill has been described on page 264. 
If, however, the wet spot or spring occurs on “ flat ” land the 
method of drainage is to construct an outlet ditch in the natural 
outlet channel as described on page 243 for draining a wet spot. 
When a spring occurs on flat land, dig a ditch into the spring, 
and then in the so-called ‘“ heart ”’ of the spring dig a shallow 
well and stone it up with field stones. This will make a catch 
basin at the end of the tile, which may be covered if desired. 
In case the spring is not well localized it is sometimes necessary 
to extend branch drains out in each direction as collecting drains. 
The size of tile for draining a spring depends entirely upon the 
amount of water to be cared for, and this can be decided only 
by local observations. 
2. Depressions in surface soil on flat land.—There often 
occur, on flat land, depressions in the surface soil into which 
surface water settles (Fig. 355). The usual practice is to drain 
these depressions by a small open ditch or plow furrow. This is 
usually considered sufficient where hay and grain are the only 
crops grown. The open ditch is, however, a nuisance in itself 
as well as a bother to construct each time the field is plowed. 
To drain such a spot often requires but a single drain (see 
instructions, page 243). In addition to the underdrain there 
should be, to one side of the tile, a broad, shallow surface drain 
to permit the surface water to run off readily in spring. The 
surface drain may be eliminated by constructing a surface 
inlet at the low. point of the depression (Fig. 353). 
3. Depressions in the subsoil—These wet places in level 
land are often one or more feet deep and have standing water 
in them until early summer. Many a man has taken a dump 
scraper and scraped out a broad open ditch, using the dirt to 
fill the low place. After this operation was completed, the 
crops on this area were drowned out as usual. The surface 
water drains off, but the free water in the soil does not have a 
chance to run off, because of a depression in the subsoil beneath 
the low spot. If an underdrain had been installed, it would

have solved the problem. It is like trying to grow house plants 
in a tight bowl, having a shallow chip in its rim for drainage. 
The surface water can get out, but the soil in the bowl is full of 
free water which cannot drain away from the plant roots. But 
if the side of the bowl is tapped near the bottom, as is accom- 
plished by the underdrain, the free water runs out and air 
takes its place. Each time the house plant is watered, or the 
field is rained on, air is pushed into the soil ahead of the water, 
and as the water goes down, pushing the air out of the drain 
ahead of it, more fresh air is being drawn in behind it. 
ORCHARD DRAINAGE 
The general principles of land drainage apply in an orchard 
as well as anywhere else. In planning orchard drainage, it is 
practically impossible to lay out the laterals as you would if 
the tree rows did not interfere. In view of the fact that tree 
fruit is an intensive money crop, the fruit-grower can well 
afford to install a slight excess of drainage, if the soil is inclined 
to be wet. A few years ago, leading orchardists felt that a drain 
between every other row of trees (apple) was sufficient, in view 
of the fact that one side of each tree was next toa drain. Now, 
however, these same men feel that if the land is flat and in- 
clined to be wet, it pays to put a drain between every row 
of trees. 
Since pears, peaches, and cherries are planted but half as 
far apart as apples, a drain in every other space between rows 
is usually sufficient. Nevertheless, there are conditions under 
which these orchards, or at least parts of them, must be drained 
in the space between every two rows of trees. It makes no 
difference how close to a tree the drain may be, provided the 
roots are not cut during installation. The tree roots will not 
enter the tile unless it contains water during the entire grow- 
ing season. When drains carrying water during the entire year 
are placed near a tree, sewer pipe should be used and the joints 
cemented to prevent the roots from entering.

CONCRETE WORK 
1. MAKING A ONE-COURSE CONCRETE WALK 
Operations : 
. Prepare the site. 
. Construct the necessary forms. 
. Mix and place the concrete. 
. Finish the surface of the concrete. 
. Cure the concrete. owe 
Tools and equipment: 
For the forms: lumber, nails, hammer, saw, carpenter’s square, 
level, straight edge, ax. 
For the concrete: cement, sand, gravel, water, barrel, measuring 
box, mixing board, screen, pail, two square-pointed shovels, hoe, 
wheelbarrow. (Page 342.) 
For laying the concrete: tamper, edger, groover, wood or cork 
float, striking board, tool to spade the concrete next to the forms. 
(Fig. 356.) 
Operations : 
One- or two-course construction. 
Walks are laid either as one-course construction or as two- 
course construction. One-course construction means that the 
full thickness of the walk or pavement is placed at one time, 
and one standard concrete mixture is used throughout. In two-

  294 CONCRETE WORK 
course construction the pavement is laid in two courses; a 
1:23 :5 ora 1:3:6 mixture is used for the base and a 1:2 
mortar for the top or wearing surface. One-course construction 
is more satisfactory unless care is taken to put the second 
course of a two-course walk on before the first course sets. 
In either case it may be cast in blocks or as one continuous 
structure and then marked off into blocks. The second 
method is not recommended. 
1. Prepare the site.—If the soil upon which the walk is to 
be constructed is sandy or gravelly soil, so that it is well drained, 
it will not be necessary to build a sub-base. Clear the surface 
of all sod and rubbish and fill any low places. Tamp down well 
any fill, or the walk will settle at such places. In heavier soils 
it is advisable to build a sub-base 4 to 8 inches thick of cinders, 
coarse gravel, or stones. Make the sub-base enough wider 
than the walk to allow the forms to be set on the sub-base. 
Moisten this material, place it in layers and tamp each layer. 
The top of the sub-base should be 4 inches below the elevation 
desired for the surface of the walk. Proper drainage of the 
sub-base is very important. If at any time water is liable 
to settle into the sub-base, a line of 3-inch drain tile should be 
laid along the bottom and extended to a suitable outlet, or 
the sub-base should be made to serve as the drain, in which 
case it should be provided with suitable outlets every 20 or 
30 feet. 
2. Cunstruct the necessary forms.—Size of walks.—Al- 
though 4 feet is an average width of walk, less than this 
would do around most farms. Because of the danger from 
frost action, slabs should not have a greater dimension than 
6 feet. 
Forms.—As most walks are 4 inches thick, 24’s make con- 
venient material for forms. Lay the 2x4’s on edge the re- 
quired distance apart on top of sub-base. Bring the top edges 
to the grade desired for the surface of the walk and note care- 
fully that the inside of the forms are in a straight line. Hold 
the 24’s in place by driving stakes on the outside at intervals 
 
-P-A-G-E-313
  MAKING A ONE-COURSE CONCRETE WALK 295 
of 3 to 4 feet. and nail through the stakes into the 2X4’s. 
Do not drive the nails in so far that they cannot be readily 
pulled out when it is desired to remove the forms. It is better 
to lay the walk in blocks, and therefore crosspieces should be so 
placed that alternate blocks can be laid. Place the crosspieces 
not over 6 feet apart (Fig. 356). Remove these cross braces 
as soon as the concrete is self-sustaining, and place the concrete 
for the alternate blocks. 
Surface drainage—All walks should either be laid with a 
slight slope from one side to the other or slightly crowned at the

center. This will allow for a free run-off of any surface water. 
By making the lower face of the strikeboard { to } inch 
higher in the center than at either side the desired crown 
may be easily formed when finishing off the walk. If the walk 
is to be sloped to one side a grade of approximately $ inch to the 
foot is sufficient. This slope is easily obtained by lowering one 
side of the walk form the required amount. 
3. Mix and place the concrete.—Proportions.—For one- 
course walks, mixtures from 1:2:4to1:23:5areused. The 
cleaner the materials and the better they are graded the leaner 
the mixture can be. 
 
-P-A-G-E-314
  
296 CONCRETE WORK 
Mixing and placing.—As directed on page 341 for mixing, 
thoroughly mix the materials to a mushy consistency, and 
shovel them into the forms; spread out carefully, spade well 
next to the forms, and strike off with a strikeboard or template 
as shown in Fig. 357. 
Sometimes, to increase the ease of finishing the surface, a 
very thin layer of a1: 2 mortar is immediately placed over the

concrete. This is then leveled off with a strikeboard. This 
mortar layer fills in the coarser concrete and greatly shortens 
the labor of trowelling. 
4, Finish the surface of the concrete.—If a smooth finish is 
desired, go over the surface with a plasterer’s steel trowel as 
soon as it begins to set. For a rough finish use only the wood 
float. Ifa very hard surface is desired, some people sprinkle 
on evenly a mixture of 1:1 cement and sand before finishing 
with the float. Go along the edge with an edging tool (Fig. 356), 
which will round off the edges. Run a groover (Fig. 356) between 
the blocks. A roller may be used, especially where a driveway 
crosses the walk, to give the surface indentations.

5. Cure the concrete.—As soon as the walk is finished, cover 
it with canvas, burlap, or boards supported above the walk to 
protect it from wind and sun. As soon as the surface has set 
sufficiently, usually the next day, sprinkle it at least once a day 
for seven to ten days. A covering of wet straw or dirt is not 
generally used for curing walks, as it is liable to discolor the

and a suitable proportion of concrete, properly mixed and cured, 
is used, a concrete walk should and will give satisfactory service.

Floors in poultry houses must be dry and warm, and there- 
fore it is usually desirable to put in a sub-base and provide for 
proper drainage. Poultry men are now requiring that concrete 
floors be made as damp-proof as possible. This is probably 
best accomplished by placing one or two layers of tar or roofing 
paper between the base and wearing surface course (see 
Fig. 359). 
1. Prepare the site-—Make the surface of the dirt floor level, 
by filling the low places or making necessary excavations, so

that the finished graded surface of the ground will be low enough 
to permit of 4 inches of concrete and where necessary a sub- 
base 4 to 6 inches thick. Put in a sub-base as described on 
page 294 for walks. 
2. Construct the necessary forms.—Ior work of this kind 
not many forms are needed. The walls or the foundations of 
the building make the outside forms. A convenient practice 
in this type of construction is to use but one form and lay the 
floor continuously. Select a straight beard 1 or 2 inches thick, 
3 inches wide, and just long enough to set in between the foun- 
dation walls. 
Begin the work of laying the concrete at the end farthest 
from the door. Along the end wall drive three or four small 
pegs with their tops 3 inches above the ground or sub-base. 
Set the form on edge crosswise of the building about 4 feet
-P-A-G-E-317
  MAKING A POULTRY-HOUSE FLOOR 299 
from the end. Stake or brace it in place. This permits a 
strip of concrete to be laid across the end of the building. As 
one becomes more proficient, a wider strip can be laid. It is 
well to divide the total length of the floor into strips of equal 
width. 
3. Mix and place the concrete.—Use a 1 : 2} :5toal:3:6 
mixture. Spread the mixture evenly between the forms and 
the end of the building. Strike it off level, using the tops of the 
pegs and the top of the form as a guide. Now remove the form 
carefully and move it back the required distance; place it as 
before and lay the next strip. .Continue until all strips are laid. 
If the door is at the side of the building rather than at one 
end, work from each end toward the door, placing the strip 
opposite the door last. 
As soon as the base is in, lay on two layers of roofing or tar 
paper cross ways with each other, and cement the joints with 
roofing cement. The wearing coat over the roofing or tar paper 
should be 1 inch thick. Use a form 1 inch deep, and place the 
wearing coat, a strip at a time. The joints of the wearing coat 
should be directly over those in the base. 
4. Finish the surface of the concrete.—Float the surface 
with a wood or cork float. Rub the surface only enough to 
level it, as too much troweling draws the water to the surface. 
This will cause hair cracks and a dusty flcor. If a smooth 
finish is desired, trowel with a steel trowel after the concrete has 
set. Some men of considerable experience make it a practice 
to sprinkle over the surface of the wearing coat, before it is 
floated, a dry mixture of equal parts of sand and cement. 
It is claimed that this practice gives a harder and neater looking 
surface. 
5. Cure the concrete.—If the floor is protected from the 
sun and wind by the building, it will not need covering. It 
should, however, be frequently sprinkled to prevent it from 
drying out too rapidly.

is in all essentials like a number of sidewalks placed side by 
side. Usually there is a curb around three or four edges of the 
feeding floor to protect the edges and to keep feed from being 
pushed off the floor on to the ground. 
1. Prepare the site and excavate for the curb and apron.— 
Remove the surface soil and any debris or roots which are 
liable to decay. Drive grade stakes and put up batter boards 
as described on page 313, with strings indicating the position

tions for building foundations (page 316 and Figs. 360 and 361). 
3. Mix and place the concrete for curb and apron.—See 
instructions for building foundations (page 316). 
4. Construct the necessary floor forms.—Size of floors.— 
A concrete floor is a sort of checkerboard of concrete slabs vary- 
ing from 5 to 8 feet square. The thickness of floors may vary

from 4 to 6 inches according to the service which they must 
render. If a pavement is to be used as a hog-feeding floor, 4 
inches is generally thick enough, but if it is to be used by 
cattle or if wagons are likely to be driven over it, 6 inches 
should be the minimum thickness. 
The forms should be of wood, one dimension of which is 
equal to the intended thickness of the floor. They should be 
well supported by stakes, as shown in Figs. 361, 362 and 363. 
Concrete floors should be blocked off with partition strips, and 
concrete placed for alternate slabs. After these have hardened, 
the cross strips can be removed and the intermediate slabs

The floor must be

that water will not 
stand on it. A slope 
of from 4 to } inch 
per foot is generally 
used (Fig. 361). The 
floor may be sloped in 
one direction and the 
curb omitted on the

In mixing the correctly proportioned materials, add enough 
water to produce a concrete of pasty or jelly-like consistency, 
so that it can be spread out in the forms and easily leveled with 
a strikeboard resting on the edge of the forms. Pass this 
strikeboard across the forms with a zig-zag motion, thus

time assisting to compact it (see instructions for making a walk,

6. Finish the surface.—Finish the floor with a wood float, 
so as to obtain a rough level surface. It is not usually desirable 
to mark off the blocks with a groover. The appearance of the 
curb may be improved by running the edger around it. A 
finished floor is shown in Fig. 364.

Molds.—There are now on the market many types of fence- 
post molds, usually made of metal. When only a few posts 
are to be made, a homemade mold of wood will be found satis- 
factory. “A great variety of post shapes is possible, and a few 
are shown in Fig. 365. 
Reinforcing.—Concrete is strong in bearing loads that are 
placed upon it, but will 
not withstand loads that 
tend to bend it or pull it 
apart. With a fence post, 
these bending strains ma; Fic. 365.—Three Shapes for Concrete f oe dipect PY 
Fence Posts. Note the position of the cone ieee See 
reinforcing rods. along the line of the fence, 
or from within or without 
the enclosure as the result of animals trying to break through. 
The reinforcement should therefore be so located as to coun- 
teract these bending strains. Several types of posts with 
reinforcement are shown in Fig. 365. The rods are located 
   
-P-A-G-E-323
MAKING CONCRETE FENCE POSTS 305 
near each corner where the greatest bending strains occur, and 
4 inch from the surface to protect them against possible ex- 
posure. Reinforcement in the center of the post is of little 
value. Quarter-inch round or square steel rods are usually 
used. 
Old iron rods that are dirty or coated with a crust of rust 
should not be used, as concrete will not stick to them. Wire is 
usually purchased in coils and is difficult to straighten so that 
it will stay in the proper place while placing concrete. Econ- 
omy of time and much greater certainty of successful results 
follow the use of steel rods. 
1. Make a one-bag batch gang mold for fence posts.— 
The dimensions of the finished post are to be 7 feet long, 4 by 5 
inches at the bottom, and 3 by 4 inches at the top. Either 
build a platform to hold the forms or place them on a good 
solid surface, such as a barn floor. If a platform is built, 
make it 8 feet long and 4 feet wide, using matched boards 
nailed to 3 stringers of 2X4’s placed on’ edge. 
Make the end and side pieces of 2X6’s. The two side 
pieces will each be 7 feet long, one end piece will be 3 feet and 
the other 2 feet long. 
Make the division strips of 1X6 material. There are four 
of these pieces, each 1 inch by 6 inch by 7 feet. 
Small beveled strips may or may not be nailed on the 
pallets, depending on whether or not it is desired to have the 
corners of the post sharp. 
Make the five pallets of 26 material. It will be well to buy 
the 2X6’s in 14-foot lengths. Use the straight edge on each 
7-foot piece. From this straight edge measure in 5 inches on one 
end and 3 inches on the other. With a straight edge or chalked 
line make a straight line connecting the two points. With a 
saw rip off the small piece. Cut the ends off square with the 
center line of the pallet. 
Make eight cleats and wedges, as shown in sketch Fig. 366 
for holding the gang together. 
Before using, the molds should be thoroughly saturated with

2. Grade and pack the base for the steps.—Fill in the 
earth and thoroughly tamp it, so as to provide a firm base on 
which to place the concrete steps. : 
3. Make the forms.—There are to be six steps and each step 
is to have a rise of 8 inches and a tread of 10 inches. The form 
consists of two 2’’X6” planks, each 5 or more feet in length, 
twelve supports for riser forms, each 2” <4” X 1’, six riser forms 
2X8" X3’, two braces of 2’’*4” material, and wedges to hold 
the two 26 planks in position. 
Referring to Fig. 371, it will be noted that the plank, to 
which are nailed the cleats for the riser form, is so placed as to 
parallel the rise of the stairs. The bottom edge of the plank 
does not touch the edges of the steps, but is slightly above 
 
-P-A-G-E-327

them. The lower end of the plank extends beyond the bottom 
of the lower step, a distance slightly greater than the width of 
the step. 
The cleats may be nailed in position before placing the planks 
and are located as follows:

(8 inches) and the tread on the beam (10 inches). Starting 
3 inches or 4 inches from the end of the plank, hold the square 
so that the 8 inches is at the lower edge of the plank. Swing 
the square until the 10-inch mark on the square comes flush 
with the lower edge of the plank (Fig. 369). Draw the lines AB 
and CD. Move the square along the plank until the 8-inch 
mark on the blade is at A, then swing the square until the

of the plank. Again draw lines corresponding to AB and CD. 
Repeat this process until the six steps have been laid out 
(Fig. 370). Nail cleats to the left of each line that runs parallel 
with the line CD with the edge of each cleat flush with each 
line (see Fig. 370). In a similar manner locate and nail the 
cleats to the other plank. So that the cleats may be easily 
removed do not drive the nails in their full length.

diameter larger than 1 inch in the concrete in contact with the

siderable extent, larger stone could, of course, be used. As 
the concrete is placed for each step, spade it well next to the 
forms. Proceed until all the steps are built. 
6. Finish and cure the concrete.—Finish the treads with a 
wood float, the same day the concrete is placed. After one day, 
or preferably two, remove the forms, moisten the risers, and 
finish them with a wood float. At this time fill any pockets or 
other imperfections with a 1 : 2} sand-cement mortar. Keep 
the steps protected and moist until the concrete is properly 
cured. The finished steps are shown in Fig. 372.

Tools and equipment : 
Tools, equipment, and supplies for making concrete (see page 293). 
Lumber, nails, and tools to make the form, four lengths of pipe for a 
sleeve, four bolts of proper size and length, four large washers. 
The size of the foundation will, of course, be gov- 
erned by the size of the machine to be placed. If possible, 
it is desirable to place the foundation first and then lay the floor 
around it. Where the floor is already in, and there is any 
question as to whether it will support the engine and foundation, 
a section of it, larger than the intended foundation, should be 
broken out. Just before placing the concrete, moisten the 
edges of this floor section and apply a paste of cement and 
water. This will make a stronger bond between the floor and 
the foundation. 
1. Build the forms.—All forms should be made so that they 
will come apart easily. Refer to Fig. 373. The side pieces 
should be cut enough longer than the foundation to allow for

washer over the anchor bolt and a length of pipe to form a 
sleeve. This pipe sleeve will allow for a slight adjustment of 
the anchor bolts. Slip the bolt through the hole in the template 
and adjust for proper height. Place each bolt in a similar 
manner. 
2. Mix and place the concrete.—Make up a batch of 1 :2 :4 
concrete. Mix it thoroughly and add enough water to give the 
concrete a quaky consistency. Place the concrete in the form, 
and spade it well around the edge of the forms.

8. Finish the surface of the concrete.—Remove the tem- 
plate after the concrete has set sufficiently to grip the bolts, 
and level off the surface of the foundation. Upon the removal 
of the form, the foundation may be moistened and gone over 
with a wood float. After the machine has been lined up and 
before it is finally bolted down, fill the space between the pipe 
sleeve and the anchor bolts with a cement mortar. 
Bolting an engine directly to a concrete foundation is less 
desirable, because of the rigidity of the concrete, than having 
wooden planks or pieces between the engine base and the con- 
crete foundation. The installation of such wood pieces allows 
for a certain amount of springiness which is desirable in any 
engine foundation, 
7. LAYING OUT A BUILDING FOUNDATION 
Operations: 
1. Locate one end of the foundation. 
2. Locate one side at right angles to the end. 
3. Put up the batter boards and the outside strings. 
4, Put up the four strings locating the inside of the foundation 
wall. 
Tools and equipment: 
Stakes, batter boards, string, nails, hammer, ax, tape-measure and 
some instrument for leveling. 
The problem is to lay out the foundation for the walls of a 
building 15 by 30 feet. The wall is to extend 2 feet above the 
ground level and to be 10 inches thick. 
1. Locate one end of the foundation.—It is first necessary to 
locate one corner of the new building. Take end AB in Fig. 374. 
Stakes A and B are located 15 feet apart. The tops of the two 
stakes should be level. In the top of stake A drive a nail 
partly in, near the center. Similarly drive a nail in stake B, 
exactly 15 feet from the nail in stake A. 
   
-P-A-G-E-332
  314 CONCRETE WORK 
2. Locate one side at right angles to the end.—It is now 
necessary to locate the direction of the side AD. To get the 
proper direction it is necessary to lay off a right angle at A 
having one of its sides AB. This is usually done with either a 
carpenter’s square, or a 6-8-10 triangle. When using the 
6-8-10 triangle method proceed as follows: Drive stake F 
in line with A and B and 6 feet from A. Drive a nail in stake 
F exactly 6 feet from the nail in stake A. Locate stake H

and drive a nail in the top of the stake H exactly 8 feet from 
the nail in A and exactly 10 feet from the nail in F. AEF 
will be a right angle, and a line passing from A over E will be 
perpendicular to the end AB of the building. 
3. Put up the batter boards and the outside strings.— Next, 
drive the stakes shown in the drawing, to which the batter boards 
GH and LK will be fastened. Nail the batter boards to these 
stakes, being sure that the top edges are level and are at the 
elevation desired for the finished wall. Stretch the string GL 
so that it will pass exactly over the nails at A and B. Secure

drive the stakes and put up the batter boards at RP and NM. 
The top edges of these batter boards should be level with those 
of GH and HK. Stretch string PH, having it pass directly 
over nails in stakes A and Z. Now put up string RM parallel 
with string GL and 30 feet from it, and string N K parallel with

4, Put up the four strings locating the inside of the founda- 
tion wall.—Now put up four more strings 10 inches inside of 
those already put up, as 10 inches is the desired thickness of the 
wall. These strings now locate not only the upper edges of the 
foundation, but also the sides of the trench. Mark out the trench 
on the ground and then remove the strings, while making the

boards to mark the positions of the strings, the strings can 
readily be replaced.

Tools and equipment: 
Tools, equipment and supplies for making concrete (page 293) 
and lumber, tools and supplies for making the forms. Wire for 
cross ties, anchor bolts if necessary. 
Concrete foundations or basement walls are either made. of 
concrete cast in place or of previously cast concrete blocks. 
For heavy loads, or severe side thrust, solid walls are usually 
used, and when necessary reinforced. 
Foundation walls should extend down to firm bearing soil, 
so as to eliminate the 
danger of settling. It 
is best to extend the 
foundation below possi- 
ble frost penetration, 
so as to prevent up- 
heaval. 
1. Determine wheth- 
er the foundation should 
have a footing.—The 
usual practice for all 
types of foundation 
walls is to give the base 
of the foundation a 
spread or footing (Fig. 
376), so that the weight 
of the building is dis- 
tributed over a larger 
area than that covered 
by the base of the 
walls. Footings are 
not difficult to build, 
and they provide an 
even surface on which Fr t

residences generally 
require footings 18

ings 12 inches wide

will serve for farm 
buildings such as 
hog houses, poultry 
houses, milk houses, 
and other buildings 
of that size.

dences are also made from 8 to 12 inches wide. Small struc- 
tures, such as poultry houses, milk houses, and garages, 
require foundation walls from 6 to 8 inches wide (Fig. 377). 
3. Build the forms.—Monolithic walls or foundations—In 
building foundations for small structures without basements, 
the earth walls of the foundation trench may be so firm as to 
make it unnecessary to use forms for that part of the wall below 
grade (Fig. 378), The trench should be excavated carefully, so

that the sides will be even and vertical, and care should be taken 
not to knock earth into the trench when depositing or spading 
the concrete. Planks placed alongside the trench will help to 
protect the edges and provide a convenient runway for wheel- 
barrows (Fig. 379). In soft ground and for walls above ground 
double forms are required (Figs. 378, 380, 383). 
Build the forms.—Since the location, size, and type of 
wall and the type and contour of the ground have a definite 
influence on the construction of the forms, only information and
-P-A-G-E-338
   
   320 CONCRETE WORK 
illustrations of a general nature can be given here. From this 
general information and the cuts, it should be possible to plan 
and construct the forms to meet the specific problem at hand. 
Forms are usually built of inch boards. Where a regular 
and even finish is desired, planed lumber should be used. Well- 
seasoned, air-dried lumber is best, as green lumber will shrink 
if not kept wet, thus opening cracks in the forms through which 
water carrying cement will leak when the concrete is placed. 
It is best to use lumber that has been dressed at least on one 
side and on the edges, because the boards will fit closely together 
and the planed surface next to the concrete will reduce the 
labor of removing and cleaning forms. Tongued and grooved 
lumber is often used for forms, and for tight forms is recom- 
“mended. It is well to have form lumber of uniform thickness, 
as any inequalities of thickness cause unevenness on the con- 
erete surface. Posts 2 by 4 inches for studs 2 to 3 feet on 
centers are usually used for supporting the forms and for 
holding them in line. If 1-inch boards are used for the form 
walls, the 2-by-4+-inch studs should be placed 2 feet to 3 feet 
apart and braced well at top and bottom (see Figs. 376 and 
378), so that the forms will withstand the pressure of wet con- 
crete and produce a straight, even wall without bulges or 
depressions. For low walls, curbs, etc., if it is possible to drive 
the studs in the ground the forms may be braced as shown in 
Fig. 380. Different methods of bracing forms are shown in 
Figs. 376, 378, 379. For keeping inside form surfaces the 
. proper distance apart, inner and outer sections should be 
clamped or wired together, at each upright stud, against wood 
“spacers,” or “spreaders,” of a length equal to the desired 
wall thickness (see Fig. 376). For walls of a medium height 
these wire ties and wood spacers might be put in every 2 feet 
vertically. The spreaders are removed as the forms are filled 
with concrete. 
Forms should be so built that if it is desired to use them 
again or to use the lumber for other work, they can be “knocked 
down ” with least injury to the lumber.    
-P-A-G-E-339
  MAKING A BUILDING FOUNDATION 321 
4. Mix and place the concrete.—Proportions.—If a founda- 
tion, located in poorly drained soil is to form part of the en- 
closure of a basement or cellar, a 1: 2:4 mixture is recom- 
mended to insure water-tight construction. For most founda- 
tion work a 1 : 23 :5 mixture will be satisfactory. - 
Placing the concrete——When placing the concrete in the 
forms, bring it all up together, for if it is all dumped in at once 
it will pile up, and much of the coarse aggregate will roll down 
and gather at the foot of the heap, : 
thus making a porous weak spot 
in the wall. 
Place the concrete in layers 
from 6 to not more than 10 inches 
deep. Spade it well next to the 
forms (Fig. 381) so as to obtain 
smooth, even surfaces. If possi- 
ble, plan to place the concrete in 
a continuous operation, so as to 
avoid construction seams. 
Construction joints—If it is 
necessary to stop work on a wall 
or foundation before it is finished, 
bring the concrete to a level in 
the forms and prepare the surface 
to receive the next day’s work, by 
placing cobble stones projecting 
halfway out of the concrete or by 
roughening the surface with a 
trowel. This will make a better 
bond. The next day, before concrete work is resumed, clean 
off the top surface of the hardened concrete. If several days 
elapse before the concrete work is resumed, coat the surface with 
a paste of cement and water just before new concrete is applied. 
If a vertical joint is necessary, make a groove by a stop 
board placed in the wall form (Fig. 382) and remove it before 
the remainder of the concrete is placed.

concrete was well spaded, the 
natural finish of the concrete 
may be sufficient. 
A very smooth finish may be 
obtained by rubbing down the 
concrete with a carborundum 
stone or wood float. As soon as 
the concrete is hard enough to 
be self-suporting, remove the 
forms, chip off the ridges, fill the 
pockets with cement mortar, 
and then paint the entire surface with cement paste (1:1) 
of cream consistency. This is rubbed in with a carborundum 
stone or wood float, and a smooth surface of even color results.

hanging burlap or canvas over them and frequently wetting 
these coverings. 
Removal of forms.—Forms must not be removed or 
“ stripped ”’ until the concrete has thoroughly hardened. The 
time required cannot be definitely stated, as so much depends 
on the nature of the work and local temperature and weather 
conditions. 
In summer, wall forms can generally be stripped after two 
days, and in colder weather from four to seven days. If the 
concrete is still soft and yielding, it should not be stripped.

cast in an inverted position (Fig. 388); and (2) large, perma- 
nent troughs which are cast where they are to be used (Figs. 
384 and 385). 
The troughs that 
are cast in an in- 
verted position may 
have a core made 
of wood (Figs. 386 
and 388) or of clay 
(Fig. 387). The wood

of the contained liquids. These pressures are provided against 
 
-P-A-G-E-344

by the reinforcement, and an additional precaution against 
freezing is provided by tapering the inside of the walls. 
The reinforcement usually used is }- to 3-inch steel rods or 
wire mesh. The number and size and spacing of the rods is 
governed by the size and shape of the tank; the larger the 
tank the more reinforcement is required. The illustration 
(Fig. 385) gives the proper amount and position of reinforce- 
ment for a permanent trough of the dimensions shown. 
Select the type of trough to be built. 
1. Construct the necessary forms.—Small troughs like the 
one illustrated on page 325 can be cast upside down on a 
level floor. Forms for these troughs cost little and can be 
taken apart and used many times. 
First select the size of the trough, then the shape of core to 
give the desired inside shape of the finished trough. 
If a floor is not available build a rigid platform (Figs. 386, 
387, 388) large enough for the trough selected. 
If a clay core is to be used, build a template as shown in Fig. 
387. Mix the clay with water until it will mold readily. Place 
it on the foundation and pack it down, and then shape it with 
the aid of the template, steel trowel, and the hands. Since 
the smoothness of the surface of the clay core determines the 
smoothness of the inside of the finished trough, it should, after 
shaping, be gone over with a steel trowel. 
If a log core (Fig. 386) is to be used, hew and shave it 
to the desired shape and place it in position on the base 
form. 
If a V-shaped or rectangular core is to be used, construct it 
as shown in Fig. 388 and place it in position on the base form. 
After the desired core is built and placed, build and place the 
sides in accordance with dimensions shown in Fig. 388 or other 
dimensions if desired. 
The sketches show the arrangement of cleats across the top 
edges and the blocks against the lower edges to hold the sides 
of the form in place. This construction is better than nailing 
the forms together. 
 
-P-A-G-E-345
  MAKING A CONCRETE WATERING TROUGH 327 
Before using, grease the forms thoroughly with soft soap 
or old cylinder oil. 
2. Mix and place the concrete and reinforcement.—Since 
at the top, the side walls are only 2 inches thick, broken stone 
or gravel larger than $ inch should not be used. For rein- 
forcement, use }-inch round or square steel rods. If possible, 
use rods long enough so that they may be bent to go the entire 
distance around the core about 1 inch from the side walls 
and have the ends overlap at the middle of one side about 12 
inches. If it is necessary to use two rods, they should be placed 
so that the ends overlap near the middle at each side of the 
trough and not at the ends or corners. After mixing a 1 : 2:3 
concrete to a quaky consistency, place a layer evenly all around 
in the form up to the position of the first reinforcing rod, 
Fig. 388, spade it well next to the forms and then place the rod. 
Place additional concrete until the form is filled to within about 
1 inch of the top. Spade it well and place three rods, spacing 
them as shown in Fig. 388. Fill the form to the top. 
3. Finish the surface of the concrete.—After one day, or 
preferably two, remove the forms, moisten the concrete with a 
1:1 cement paste, and rub it in with a wood float or car- 
borundum stone. This will give a very neat-appearing surface. 
At this time any holes may be patched with a 1 :2 cement 
mixture. The inside surface is often given a wash of Portland 
cement and water mixed to the consistency of cream and applied 
with a brush, to close all pores and insure a water-tight 
job. ; 
4, Cure the concrete.—As with any concrete work, the tank 
must be protected from sun and wind and kept moist until 
thoroughly cured.

A floor strainer will be needed if the floor has a drain, and 
tile for the drain. 
Washing floors and garage floors are usually provided with a 
drain, in which case they slope from each side toward a central 
point where the strainer is located. For washing floors the low 
point is usually in the center of the floor (Fig. 389), while for 
garage floors it is generally located near one end so that it will 
be nearly under the engine. 
1. Prepare the site.—Prepare the site as directed for feeding 
floors and walks (page 294). 
2. Put in the drain and strainer.—Locate the drain and 
point where the strainer is to be located. Excavate for the 
drain and lay the tile (see instructions, page 250). Four-inch 
tile should be used. Locate the strainer and set it at the 
desired height. It should be about 2 inches below the outside 
edges of the finished floor. See Fig. 389 for details of construc- 
tion.

approaches we have to permanency in building materials, and 
in the long run the cost is usually no more than that of using 
a less durable material. The many uses for concrete about a 
farm are too well known to need enumeration here. Fortu- 
nately, most of the farm jobs to be done with concrete are such 
that any one can readily learn to do them. With the aid of

building of forms. Then there are the jobs such as building a 
new cistern, a foundation wall for a small building, or a feed or 
watering trough. Although these require more elaborate forms, 
the actual concrete work, after the forms are constructed, is 
no more difficult than laying a concrete floor. Probably one 
of the reasons why many are not making more farm improve- 
ments with concrete is because they dislike to start for fear 
that their work may not turn out satisfactorily. The thing to 
do is to start in a small way. First build a short walk, a floor 
in the poultry house, or a part of a cellar floor. Having made a 
start and gained experience in proportioning, mixing, and using 
   
-P-A-G-E-349
GENERAL INFORMATION ON CONCRETE WORK 331 
concrete, you will find it easy to proceed to the more difficult 
jobs. 
What is concrete? 
Concrete is often called an artificial or cast stone, and is 
made up of definite proportions of Portland cement, sand, and 
gravel or broken stone mixed with water and allowed to harden 
under proper conditions in forms or molds. The quality of 
this homemade stone will depend largely upon the kind of 
materials from which it is made, the proper grading and mixing 
of these materials, the proper placing of the mixture and, 
last but not least, the proper curing of the mixture after it is 
placed. 
What is Portland cement? 
Portland cement is primarily a mixture of limestone or blast: 
furnace slag and clay or shale, heated until they begin to melt 
and blend together. The resulting clinker is ground to a fine 
powder, and gypsum is added to control the rate of setting. 
It has the property of hardening when mixed with water and 
will hold together such substances as sand, gravel, crushed 
stone or cinders. This hardening process is called setting. 
Any of the standard brands are tested and guaranteed by the 
manufacturers and will produce good concrete, provided the 
cement has not deteriorated in shipment or storage. If the 
cement is not lumpy it is probably in good condition. This 
lumpy condition should not be mistaken for a caked condition 
caused by piling up the cement in a large pile. 
If the lumps can be broken in the hand or between the 
fingers, they have been formed by pressure on the cement and 
are not due to the presence of moisture. Sacks containing 
lumps that will not crumble under gentle pressure should be 
discarded. Many of the so-called concrete failures often 
ascribed to the cement, however, are the result of dirty sand, 
poor mixing or too rapid drying. 
 
-P-A-G-E-350
332 CONCRETE WORK 
How should cement be stored? 
Cement should always be stored in a dry place and be 
supported upon some type of platform so that the bags will not 
be in contact with the ground. Do not store it in damp barns 
or basements over winter. 
How is Portland cement packed for shipment? 
Portland cement is packed and shipped in standard cloth 
sacks or in paper bags holding 94 pounds net weight. For all 
practical purposes, a sack of Portland cement may be con- 
sidered as one cubic foot. Cloth sacks are charged to the 
cement purchaser. When empty they should be returned to 
the cement dealer, who will buy them back if they are fit for 
further use as cement containers. Cement sacks which have 
been wet, torn or otherwise rendered unfit for use are not 
redeemable. Paper bags are not returnable. 
What are aggregates? 
Sand and pebbles or broken stone are usually spoken of as 
aggregates. Sand is called fine aggregate, and pebbles or 
crushed stone coarse aggregate. 
Fine aggregate : 
Sand or other fine aggregate includes all particles from 
very fine (exclusive of dust) up to those which will just pass 
through a screen having meshes } inch square. Sometimes 
fine crushed stone screenings are used in place of sand, but 
where so used they must be considered as sand. 
Sand should be clean, that is, free from dust, loam, clay and 
vegetable matter; it should also be hard and coarse. The 
quality of sand is mainly dependent upon the relative coarse- 
ness of its grains. By a coarse sand is here meant one made up 
of large and small grains in which the larger-sized grains, that 
is, 7s to $ inch, predominate. 
To determine whether a sand is hard, the following test is
-P-A-G-E-351
GENERAL INFORMATION ON CONCRETE WORK 333 
suggested: Select an average sample of the larger particles and 
strike them with an ordinary hammer. If any large propor- 
tion of the materials pulverize easily, the sample and the sand 
in question should be discarded. Shale sands are unsuitable 
for tanks, troughs, cisterns and most concrete subjected to 
weathering. 
Concrete made from dirty sand or pebbles is not strong, 
hardens very slowly and may never harden enough to permit 
the concrete to be used for the purpose intended, 
Coarse aggregate: 
Coarse aggregate includes all gravel, pebbles or broken 
stone ranging from } inch up to 14 or 2 inches. The maximum 
size of coarse aggregate to be used is governed by the nature of 
the work. In thin slabs or walls, the largest pieces of aggre- 
gate should not exceed one-third the thickness of the section of 
concrete being placed, while for reinforced concrete 14 inches 
in diameter is the maximum size which will work closely around 
the reinforcement. 
Pebbles or crushed stone to be used as coarse aggregate 
should be tough, fairly hard, and free from any of the impuri- 
ties that would be objectionable in sand. Stone containing a 
considerable quantity of soft (see test for hardness of sand, 
page 333), flat or elongated particles should not be used. The 
best coarse aggregate is made up of assorted sizes. 
Cinders may be used for the coarse aggregate, provided 
they are carefully screened so that they contain no fine material. 
They should be made up of clean, hard clinkers and contain no 
unburned coal. Cinder concrete is not as strong as that made 
from gravel or crushed stone. When used, the mixture should 
be a little wetter than gravel concrete. 
Water: 
Only clean water should be used for mixing concrete.

  334 CONCRETE WORK 
What is bank-run gravel? 
This is the name usually applied to the natural mixture of 
sand and pebbles, as taken from a gravel bank. While it is 
the general practice to use this bank-run grave! for concrete, 
it is not, in most instances, the most economical thing to do 
without screening. As a rule bank-run gravel contains too 
much sand. It is best to run the bank-run gravel as it comes 
from the pit over a }-inch mesh screen so as to separate the 
sand from the pebbles and then reproportion them later in the 
volumes desired. If bank-run gravel containing too much 
sand is used, an excess of cement must be added to the mixture 
or it will not be of the strength desired. The reason for this 
is that the greater the percentage of fine material the greater 
the amount of surface to be ‘coated with cement, and the 
greater the volume of voids to be filled with cement. It is 
therefore a matter of economy to grade the aggregates so as to 
secure the minimum volume of voids or air spaces to be filled, 
and surfaces to be covered, with cement. 
The ideal mixture: 
The ideal mixture is one in which there is just enough sand 
to exactly fill the voids in the coarse aggregate and just enough 
cement paste to cover the surface of each particle of sand and 
coarse aggregate and just fill all the voids. In practice, we 
endeavor to proportion our material so as to approach, as 
closely as possible, this ideal condition. For all general pur- 
poses, if the volume of sand is equal to half the volume of 
gravel, and the volume of cement is equal to half the volume of 
sand, the resulting mixture is near enough to the ideal. So 
proportioned, the sand-concrete mortar is slightly more than 
enough to fill the space in the coarse aggregate. 
Using bank-run gravel.—Suppose it is desired to mix a 
batch of 1:2:4 concrete—1 sack of cement, 2 cubic feet of 
sand, 4 cubic feet of gravel. The proportion of cement to 
aggregate before mixing is 1 cubic foot of cement to 6 cubic 
   
-P-A-G-E-353
  
GENERAL INFORMATION ON CONCRETE WORK 335 
feet of aggregate. When mixed, however, the total volume of 
concrete would be but slightly over 4 cubic feet (Fig. 391), 
because the sand would fill the spaces in the gravel and the 
cement would fill the spaces in the sand. The proportion of 
cement to concrete is about 1 to 4. Suppose 6 cubic feet of bank- 
run gravel were used for the aggregate instead of 2 cubic feet of 
sand and 4 cubic feet of gravel. When mixed with 1 cubic 
foot of cement, the volume of concrete would now be 6 cubic

feet (Fig. 392). In this case the proportion of cement to con- 
crete, now 1 to 6, is less than when the aggregates were pro- 
portioned. All the voids would not be filled, and the concrete 
would not be as dense or as strong as if a 1: 2:4 mixture had 
been used. From this it can be seen that it is always best to 
screen bank-run gravel and reproportion the sand and gravel 
as desired. 
A common practice, where bank-run material is to be used 
in small concrete work, such as may be done on the farm, is

  336 CONCRETE WORK 
not to screen all the material and reproportion it, but to 
determine how it is already proportioned. It will usually be 
found that there is not enough coarse material. A quantity of 
bank-run gravel is screened to get out sufficient coarse aggre- 
gate, so that when this is mixed with the bank-run material the ” 6

approximate proportions will be obtained. The excess of fine 
material or sand accumulated may be used for making sand- 
cement mortar for plastering or for surface coats, ete. 
It often happens that only a few yards of concrete are to 
be laid, and bank-run gravel can be easily obtained. Coarse 
material must be obtained elsewhere, or additional bank-run 
gravel must be screened. Under such conditions it may be
-P-A-G-E-355
  GENERAL INFORMATION ON CONCRETE WORK 337 
more economical to use the bank-run gravel, using some excess 
cement. 
How may sand or gravel be tested for impurities? 
It is desirable to test every sand to determine the approxi- 
mate amount of clay loam or other foreign material in it. A 
very simple test is to fill a quart fruit jar to the depth of 2 inches 
with sand, and then fill the jar to within an inch of the top 
with clean water, Shake well and let it set until the water 
clears up. The sand will sink to the bottom, while the mud,

which is held in suspension longer, will settle on top of the sand 
(Fig. 393). If the layer of mud is over 3% inch thick the sand 
should not be used unless it is first washed. This test is usually 
sufficient, but in regions where the concrete, made of local sand, 
has a reputation for not hardening properly, an additional test 
to determine the quality of the impurities in the sand is recom- 
mended. 
A further test, known as the “colorimetric test,’’! has been 
developed for this purpose. Procure from a drug store 1 ounce 
of caustic soda and dissolve it in 1 quart of water. Fill a 
1The “colorimetric test’? was devised by Prof. D. H. Abrams and

graduated 12-ounce prescription bottle! up to the 44-ounce 
mark with the sand in question, then fill the bottle up to the 
7-ounce mark with the caustic soda solution, cork, shake 
thoroughly and set aside. If after twenty-four hours the liquid 
is practically clear or no darker than a straw color, the sand 
may be considered good for all kinds of conerete work. If the 
liquid is a dark amber color, the sand is fit only for use where 
the work is relatively unimportant. If the liquid is dark or 
brownish in color it is unfit for use in concrete. 
It sometimes happens that the only available sand contains 
so much clay, loam, or other impurities that it is necessary to 
wash it before it can be used in concrete. This can be accom- 
plished by shoveling the sand into a sand washer set at an angle 
of about 40 degrees. A sand washer may consist of a wooden 
frame, having a screen with 30 meshes to the inch, well sup- 
ported by cleats, for a bottom. Sand is shoveled into the top, 
and as it slides down the screen it is washed by water from a 
hose. The clean sand accumulates at the bottom of the 
washer while the dirty water drains off through the screen. 
If a suitable screen is placed at the lower end of the 
trough, screening and washing may be accomplished in one 
operation. 
Proportioning concrete mixtures: 
In order to obtain a strong, dense, durable concrete, the 
materials entering into it must be definitely proportioned. For 
a given purpose, a definite quantity of Portland cement with a 
definite quantity of sand and a definite quantity of gravel 
should be used to obtain the best results. 
Following is a list of suggested mixtures for the particular 
jobs indicated. 
1Tf a graduated 12-ounce bottle can not be readily obtained, a 10- or 
16-ounce bottle can be used and the proper quantities of sand and soda 
solution closely estimated.

  GENERAL INFORMATION ON CONCRETE WORK 341 
First determine the number of cubic feet of concrete that 
are to be placed. Reduce all the dimensions to feet or fractions 
of feet so that the result will be in cubic feet. 
Example 1.—Suppose it is desired to place a 1: 2:4 mixture 
for a one-course walk 30 feet long, 3 feet wide and 4 inches 
thick. The volume of concrete would be 30 feet by 3 feet by - 
3 foot or 30 cubic feet. In Table No. 6, under a 1: 2:4 mix, it 
is stated that for 1 cubic foot of concrete, .22 sack of cement, 
.44 cubic foot sand and .89 cubic foot gravel are necessary. 
For 30 cubic feet multiply these figures by 30. The amount of 
materials required for this walk is therefore 6.6 sacks of cement, 
13.2 cubic feet of sand and 26.7 cubic feet of gravel. If it is 
desired to know the quantity of cement in barrels or the 
quantity of sand and gravel in cubic yards, divide the cement 
by 4 and the sand and gravel by 27. 
Example 2.—How much material will be required to make 
50 fence posts each 3 by 3 inches at the top and 5 by 5 inches at 
the bottom and 7 feet long. Use a 1:2:3 mixture. The 
volume of one post is 3 foot (average width) by } foot by 7 feet 
or $ cubic feet, The volume of 50 posts would equal 
$X50=23° = 39 cubic feet. 
Refer again to Table 6. Ascertain the amounts of cement, 
sand and gravel necessary for 1 cubic foot of cement of this 
mixture and multiply by 39. 
Mixing concrete: 
Do not guess at quantities, but measure all materials accu- 
rately. This can be done easily if a bottomless measuring box 
isused. Sucha box should be made to hold exactly 1 cubic foot, 
2 cubic feet, or any other volume desired (Fig. 394). To 
measure the materials the box is placed on the mixing platform 
and filled. When the required amount of material has been 
placed in it, the box is lifted off and since the box has no bottom, 
the material remains on the platform. Cement need not be

measured, because one sack can be considered as 1 cubic foot 
in volume. Although not recommended, a pail or shovel 
might also be used in proportioning aggregates. For example, 
a 1:2:4 batch of concrete would be measured by taking 1 pail

or shovel of Portland cement, 2 pails or shovels of sand and 
4 pails or shovels of pebbles or stone. 
Mixing the materials: 
Concrete may be mixed either by hand or by machine. 
With a machine, thorough mixing is easier to obtain, and all
-P-A-G-E-363
  GENERAL INFORMATION ON CONCRETE WORK — 343 
batches will be more uniform. First-class concrete, however, 
can be mixed by hand. Regardless of which way mixing is 
done, it should continue until every pebble or stone is com- 
pletely coated with a thoroughly mixed mortar of sand and 
cement. 
Mixing platform: 
For hand mixing a water-tight platform should be provided. 
(Fig. 394). The size of the mixing board required will depend 
largely upon the number of men employed and the amount of 
available room. 
The larger the board the more convenient it is, of course. 
A platform 7 feet wide and 12 feet long is large enough 
for two men using shovels to work upon it at one time. 
Such a platform (Fig. 394), should preferably be made of boards 
tongued and grooved so that the joints will be water-tight. 
These boards may be nailed to three or more 2X4’s. Since it 
is important that the mixer shovel with the boards and not 
against them, these boards should be placed the short way of 
the platform. 
Hand mixing: 
Although mixing concrete is a simple operation, it often 
fails to receive the proper amount of attention, for many 
failures are due to poor mixing. Regardless of what method is 
used in mixing, it is important that a uniform mixture be 
obtained. . 
The usual procedure in mixing concrete by hand is as follows: 
Spread out evenly, on the mixing platform, the measured 
quantity of sand. On this dump the required amount of 
cement, and distribute it evenly over the sand (Fig. 395). Turn 
the cement and sand over thoroughly with square-pointed 
shovels (Fig. 396), a sufficient number of times to produce a 
mass of uniform color, free from streaks of brown and gray. 
Such streaks indicate that the sand and cement have not been

thoroughly mixed. - Measure the required quantity of pebbles 
or broken stone (Fig. 397) and spread them in a layer on top of 
the cement-sand mixture. Again mix all of the materials by 
turning with shovels until the pebbles have been uniformly

three turnings are necessary. Make a depression or hollow, in

while turning the materials. Continue the turning until the 
cement (Fig. 399), sand, and pebbles have been thoroughly and 
uniformly combined and the: desired consistency or wetness 
obtained throughout the mixture. 
Although it is impossible to state the exact amount of water 
that should be used, since the sand contains varying amounts of 
moisture, about 1 gallon of water will be required for each cubic

foot of concrete mixed. After the required quantity of water is 
determined for the first batch, it will be found advantageous to 
measure it’ out thereafter. 3 
It is very important that no more water be used than 
necessary, as too much will reduce the strength of the concrete. 
Too little water will also reduce the strength and make it porous. 
For general use, concrete, after thoroughly mixing, should be 
wet enough to form a quaky, mushy consistency. 
Machine mixing: 
Machine mixing of concrete is, of course, preferable to hand. 
mixing, as a more uniform mixture is obtained. A batch should 
be left in the machine for at least two minutes. A machine is 
not practical where only a small quantity of concrete is to be 
mixed, but if a considerable quantity is to be mixed it would 
be well to investigate at least a barrel mixer. Machine mixers 
operated by hand or by power may be obtained. A mixer 
must not be run so fast that the materials tend to cling to the 
inner surface, for to become thoroughly mixed they must be 
free to tumble around in the barrel. 
Placing concrete: 
Place the concrete in the forms as soon as possible after 
mixing. Do not allow it to stand for more than thirty minutes 
after mixing, because soon after water is added to cement the 
setting action begins. After setting has started, concrete 
should not be remixed to soften it, since the binding effect of 
the cement has been somewhat lost. It is best to deposit the 
concrete in the forms in layers about 6 inches in depth, and 
spade it to eliminate the air pockets so that it will settle, and 
form a dense mass. When “ spading,” the chisel-edge board 
or spade is moved up and down between the concrete and the 
side of the forms. Working the concrete in this way next to 
the forms pushes the large pebbles or stones back from the 
face of the forms into the concrete and results in a smooth, 
dense surface next to the forms. 
   
-P-A-G-E-368
  348 CONCRETE WORK 
Protecting newly placed concrete : 
The setting of concrete is a slow chemical process which 
takes place in the presence of water. If concrete is left exposed 
to wind and sun, much of the water necessary to hardening will 
evaporate, and the concrete will simply dry out. 
Concrete walks and floors or similar large surfaces should be 
protected by a covering of wet straw, moist earth, or other 
material which will retain moisture. These materials should 
not be placed until the concrete has hardened sufficiently to 
withstand the pressure of the thumb without injury to the sur- 
face. Keep this covering moist, in warm weather, by frequent 
sprinkling for several days. Walls, or portions of concrete 
which cannot readily be protected as described, may be covered 
with moist canvas or burlap. This covering should be kept 
moist for several days, the exact length of time depending upon 
the weather. Many of the so-called dusty concrete floors are 
dusty because the surface was permitted to dry out too 
rapidly. 
Concrete in winter : 
It is better to do concrete work during mild weather. 
Cold weather retards the setting of cement and freezing injures 
it. Certain kinds of concrete work, such as making tile, 
building blocks, etc., can well be done in winter if a suitable 
place is available in which to do the work and to store the 
materials and the finished product. The materials must be 
stored, to be sure that there is no frost in them, and the 
finished tile or blocks must be stored to protect them from 
freezing for at least forty-eight hours. 
If it is necessary to build a foundation or other outside 
work during freezing weather,! the sand and pebbles and 
water should be heated to such a temperature that when the 
concrete is placed in the forms it will have a temperature of 
80 degrees. Cement is not heated.

GENERAL INFORMATION ON CONCRETE WORK 349 
Reinforced concrete : 
Reinforcement is the term used to describe the steel rods 
or wire mesh placed in concrete to increase its ability to resist 
bending strains. Like stone, concrete is very strong in bearing 
loads that are placed directly upon it, but is relatively weak 
when subjected to strains that tend to bend it or to pull it 
apart. Reinforcement of steel rods or wires are placed in the 
concrete to increase its power to resist these strains. To be of 
value, the steel reinforcement must be placed in the correct 
position; that is, in that part of the concrete where it will be 
most effective in resisting the pulling or bending strains. For 
example, in a concrete beam, the reinforcement is placed near 
the lower side, as that is the side which tends to pull apart 
when the beam is loaded. It is recommended that important 
or elaborate structures, such as floors above ground, beams, 
columns, retaining walls, silos and other buildings, be built 
from approved designs! or be designed by an experienced 
engineer. 
It is very necessary that the steel reinforcement be placed 
accurately in position and tied firmly in place by wire hoops or 
ties twisted around them, before concrete is deposited in the 
forms.

any house, whether heated or not, any water system should 
have some means of draining the water, either in cold weather, 
if necessary, or in other emergencies.

much labor, in that there is no longer any need for carrying

water either in or out: it may be pumped in at the sink and the 
waste water poured out through the drain pipe. 
An actual installation of a simple system is shown in Fig. 400. 
A lead trap, connected with an iron waste pipe by means of a 
lead-iron union, has been used. The sink, which is held in 
place by two wall brackets, is an agate-enameled iron sink with 
two drain boards, the one on the right supporting a force pump. 
For this system, the force pump shown is no better than a 
pitcher pump; but if it be desired to make this system more 
complete later, a force pump had best be purchased in the first 
place, since a pitcher pump can be used only for the simple 
system.

Pipe stocks and dies.—Pipe stocks for cutting threads come 
in a number of sizes. One to take dies for cutting }-inch, 
8-inch, }-inch, $-inch, and 1-inch pipe and one to take dies for 
cutting 1}-inch to 2-inch pipe, inclusive, would be necessary to 
handle the threading of all the sizes of pipe shown in installing 
the systems outlined in this book, and this range covers practi- 
cally all sizes of ; 
pipes used on 
farms. The dies cut

all the threads on : 
the pipe have entered the fitting. This tightness is deter- 
mined by the adjustment of the dies. 
A common type of pipe stock, with the dies in place, is 
shown in Fig. 401. On the upper left-hand corner of the pipe 
stock is a guide mark (finger pointing to it) and on the edge of    
    j Fic. 402.—For Each Set of Dies there is a Collar of Proper Size. 
the die there is a mark. These two are aligned by means of 
the set screw, s, and then the die is held rigidly in place by the 
screw t. The other die of the pair is likewise adjusted and 
fastened in the stock. If it be desired to cut shallower threads, 
each die is moved out from the guide on the pipe stock an 
equal distance and fastened; for cutting a deeper thread, they 
are moved toward the center. Sometimes, on large pipes, the
-P-A-G-E-374
  
354 A FARM WATER SYSTEM 
threads are first cut shallow and then the dies are reset and 
with a second cutting the threads are deepened to the desired 
point. 
For each pair of dies there is a collar, or guide, of proper 
size which is slipped into place in the stock and held by a thumb 
serew (Fig. 402). 
Threading a pipe.—The method of cutting threads is shown 
in Fig. 403. The pipe stock should not be turned continuously 
on the pipe until the threads 
are cut, but should at inter- 
vals be rocked backwards, to 
free the dies of metal chips. 
While cutting threads, lard 
oil or some other suitable 
thread-cutting oil should be 
used as a lubricant to pre- 
vent the rapid dulling of the 
dies and the consequent in- 
jury of the threads being 
cut. Ordinary lubricating 
oil is not to be recommended. 
When the thread is finished 
Fia. 403.—Cutting Threads on Pipe. the stock and dies are backed 
off. Later on, when the pipe 
is to be screwed into a fitting, some red lead, white lead, or 
pipe-joint compound should be spread on the threads so as 
to make a water-tight joint. 
Cutting and threading a nipple.—To one who has done but 
little work with piping, the question as to how to go about the 
making of a short nipple (Fig. 453) is puzzling. A piece of 
pipe of the proper size should be selected and marked for the 
length of nipple desired. The middle of this length should be 
marked and thread cut to this middle mark. The short length 
of pipe is then cut off at the desired length. In order to thread 
and ream the other end, some means of holding the nipple 
must be provided. 
 
-P-A-G-E-375
  INSTALLING A SIMPLE SYSTEM FOR THE KITCHEN 355 
To do this, screw a coupling on to the threaded end of a 
snort piece of pipe of the same size as the nipple. The cou- 
pling must be tight on the threads but the pipe end must not 
extend more than about half- 
way through the coupling. If 
it does, remove the coupling 
and with a hack saw cut off 
the required length from the 
threaded pipe end or select 
another piece which has. been 
cut with shallower threads. 
With this pipe held in the vise, 
serew the coupling securely in 
place on the pipe and into the : é , 
coupling screw the partly made yg, 404.—Cutting Pipe. a, The

against the end of the pipe 
within the coupling. By changing the guide collar in the 
pipe-die stock the threading of the nipple can now be com- 
pleted. 
Cutting pipe.—Pipes are cut by means of a tool which carries 
one or three  sharp- 
edged steel wheels so 
mounted that they may 
be forced against the 
pipe. The tool is then 
rotated about the pipe 
and the wheel or wheels 
form a groove in the 
metal. By twisting the 
handle the cutting 
pressure is again in- 
creased, the tool again 
rotated, and the process 
is thus continued until 
the pipe is cut. For farm use the type having one cutting ra

356 A FARM WATER SYSTEM 
wheel (Fig. 404, a) and two plain rollers (Fig. 404, b) is to be 
preferred to the three-wheeled pattern. 
Reaming pipe.—After cutting, a burr is left on the inside of 
the pipe, which reduces the effective size of the pipe and, if not 
removed, will cause undue friction. To remove this the home- 
made type of reamer shown in Fig. 405 may be used or a regular 
pipe reamer may be purchased. The homemade reamer is 
merely a flat, wedge-shaped piece of steel with a handle attached. 
With the point inserted in the pipe, as shown in Fig. 405, when 
the reamer is rotated, the burr is readily removed. 
Operations: 
1. Locate the sink.—Place the sink, with the bottom of the 
inside at such a distance from the floor that in washing dishes 
stooping will be unnecessary. A great variety of sinks with 
suitable strainers can be purchased for kitchen installations. 
A sink need not necessarily have an attached back, as for some 
models this can be obtained and attached later if desired. 
2. Install the trap.—A trap must be installed between the 
sink and the waste pipe, 
so that gases may not 
pass back through the 
waste pipe and into the 
kitchen. The ordinary 
S-type kitchen-sink trap 
(Fig. 406) is so constructed 
that water will remain in 
the lower bend, thus mak- 
ing a water seal between 
the sink and the drain 
pipe. Such a trap usually 
contains a clean-out plug 
(Fig. 406), which may be removed if the trap becomes 
obstructed. Iron traps may be purchased which are bell 
shaped at the top, are easily bolted to the under side of the 
sink, and are threaded at the discharge end to receive the

wrought-iron or steel waste 
pipe. Such a trap does away 
with the necessity of soldering 
or wiping a joint. 
A lead trap has some ad- 
vantages over the rigid, cast- 
iron one and may be installed 
without making a soldered con- 
nection or a wiped joint. The 
fittings and methods for doing 
this are as follows: Slip the 
sink clamp over the end of the 
lead trap and then, with a 
turning pin, bell out the upper 
end of the trap to fit the sink 
clamp (Figs. 407, 408). Then 
slip the clamp up to the top of 
the trap and further shape the 
belled end by using a hammer 
until it snugly fits the sink 
clamp. Place a packing of

bolting the trap, and clamp to 
the sink. Attach the trap and 
clamp to the sink, drawing the 
clamp tight by two bolts (Fig. 
406). Attach the lower end of 
the lead trap to the iron waste 
pipe by using a special lead-iron 
union (Fig. 409) which is made 
up of three parts. First, slip 
the threaded collar, B, back- 
wards over the lower end of 
the trap, then force the flanged 
brass collar, A, backwards into place, and flange the lead 
 
-P-A-G-E-378

over the flanged end of the brass collar, as shown in Fig. 410. 
The threaded collar is now held by the flange of the brass collar 
and it cannot slip off the lead trap (Fig. 411). The special 
bushing, C, is tapped on the

the outside disposal system.— 
The waste pipe should not be smaller than 1} or 13 inches and 
should extend to larger tile outside of the house. It is unde- 
sirable to use pipe as small as this for any greater distance than 
is absolutely necessary, 
as it is likely to become 
filled with grease and 
cause trouble.

water from a kitchen sink carries practically no solids, it does 
not need as elaborate a system for its disposal as. is necessary A B Cc

for the wastes from a toilet. It is better, however, to dispose 
of it at some distance from the well, so that there will be no 
danger of its draining through the soil into the house water 
supply. 
The methods of disposal discussed below are recommended 
as temporary rather than 
permanent. As this job is 
written with the assumption 
that ultimately a complete 
water system, with adequate 
means for sewage disposal, 
will be installed, those parts 
of the simpler systems which 
must later be discarded 
should be constructed and 
installed as economically as 
possible. 
Gravel pit—A very sim- 
ple method for disposing of 
kitchen waste water in open 7 sil 
soils is to construct a pit or Fic. 411.—The Threaded Collar has 
been Slipped up into Place. This 
shows the bevel on the special bush- 
ing.    cesspool about 4 feet across 
and 4 or 5 feet deep. This 
may be stoned up or filled 
with coarse gravel or stone and the waste water run into it. 
Tile drainage.—Another means is to conduct the waste 
water into a run of farm drain tile, 50 feet or more in length, 
depending on the soil, and laid about 18 inches below the sur- 
face and with a space of from § to } inch between the joints. 
There should be installed a grease trap between the house and 
the tile. 
Grease trap.—As the effective operation of either of 
these systems is liable to be impeded by grease from the kitchen 
waste water, it is recommended that between the house and 
either the pit or the tile, a grease trap be constructed, as 
follows: In the ground place a barrel or construct a concrete 
   
-P-A-G-E-380
  360 A FARM WATER SYSTEM 
tank of from 20 to 50 gallons capacity. Either barrel or tank 
should be covered with at least 1 foot of earth. Connect up 
both the incoming and the outgoing drain pipes so that the 
waste water will enter and leave through an ell. The pur- 
pose of this tank is to allow the grease to collect at the top 
and the coarser material to settle so that only the more or less 
grease-free waste water will pass on. 
      
  
  
  
  
  
  
    Cistern 
  
Fic. 412.—A Shallow-well Installation. The pump cylinder and spout: are 
located at the sink. 
5. Select the pump.—Under certain conditions it is possible 
to install, at the kitchen sink, a pump which will draw water 
from the well or cistern. The condition limiting such an instal- 
lation is the vertical distance, or height, from the pump cylinder 
 
-P-A-G-E-381
  INSTALLING A SIMPLE SYSTEM FOR THE KITCHEN 361 
down to the surface of the water in the well. Under actual 
operation this distance should not be more than 20 feet or, in 
extreme cases, 25 feet above the water surface (Fig. 412). This 
limitation is discussed on page 417. 
For use with such a shallow well or cistern there may be 
installed at the sink either a pitcher pump, which is open at the 
top and delivers water at the level of the top of the pump 
cylinder, or a force pump, which is closed at the top and which 
may be made to force water to a level higher than that of the 
cylinder. 
The shallow well or cistern need not necessarily be under 
the kitchen, nor even just outside; indeed it may be a con- 
siderable distance from the house, as horizontal suction pipes 
extending quite long distances cause no trouble if they are 
perfectly air-tight. It should be remembered, however, that 
the farther the well is from the house, the less the vertical dis- 
tances between the water and the pump can be, as the friction 
loss resulting from drawing the water through the long hori- 
zontal pipe, plus the vertical height between the water and the 
pump cylinder, can not exceed the limiting suction lift (see 
page 417). 
Should the vertical distance between the water and the 
pump be too great to allow the use of a pitcher pump, it is 
sometimes still possible to install a pump operated at the 
kitchen sink; but this pump must not be so constructed that 
the spout and pump cylinder are together. By constructing a 
dry well under the kitchen, or by installing the cylinder in the 
cellar, a pump such as the one shown in Fig. 413 might be used. 
In this pump the cylinder is located at some distance below the 
spout and is connected with it by means of a length of pipe 
through which the water is delivered. This is, in reality, a 
shallow-well installation and the limiting factor is again the 
vertical distance between the top of the cylinder and the sur- 
face of the water. 
It is thus evident that, where conditions permit, either of 
these types of shallow-well pump may be located at the sink.

and waste pipes would be the same as described under job 1 
and the piping between the pump and overhead tank and all 
other connections would be practically the same as described 
under job 2. 
6. Connect the pump with the water supply——The pipe 
extending from the pump to the well should never be smaller 
than the connection provided at the pump. For long-suction 
lines the pipe should be larger, and an air chamber near the 
pump may, in extreme cases, be provided in the suction 
pipe. 
Just beneath the pump shown in Fig. 400 there is a union. 
This is a pipe fitting used to connect a line of pipe with some 
stationary fitting, or to connect two stationary fittings together 
by a pipe. A union (Fig. 414) consists of three parts. Brass- 
seat ground unions do not re- : ie! 
quire a washer, d, but all plain a : 
unions do. Part a screws on to ie D 
one end of the pipe to be joined a. 2 
and has a shoulder which is > 
engaged by the threaded nut, b. @ 
Part c has both outside and 
inside threads and screws on the 
other end of pipe. The washer, d, is placed on a, the pipes are 
placed end to end, and the threaded nut, 6, is turned on to part 
c, thus bringing a, d, and c together tightly. 
7. Protect the pipes from freezing.—Lay the horizontal 
suction pipe from the well below the frost line. If the vertical 
suction pipe within the house is exposed to freezing tempera- 
ture, wrap it with rags, burlap, or tar paper, and box it. Make 
the box 6 inches or more square, depending on the locality, and 
fill the space between the pipe and the box with shavings, 
sawdust, or dry leaves. Pack the shavings and sawdust 
loosely, and keep all packing dry. 
When a pitcher pump is used the pipes need not be boxed, 
provided a foot valve is not placed at the lower end of the 
suction pipe in the well. These pumps are usually so con-     Fig. 414.—The Union.
-P-A-G-E-384
364 A FARM WATER SYSTEM 
structed that in cold weather the water can be drained out of 
the pipe by raising the pump handle. 
If the sink trap is likely to freeze, box it and pack it in saw- 
dust; or if desired, drain it at night by removing the clean-out 
plug. 
2. INSTALLING A SYSTEM SUPPLYING RUNNING COLD WATER 
Operations : 
1. Install the tank. : 
(a) Select the type, size and shape of the overhead tank. 
(6) Attach the delivery pipe to the tank. 
(c) Install the shut-off valve and union. 
(d) Install the overflow or water gauge. 
2. Connect the pump with the overhead tank. 
(a) Install the check valve. 
(6) Install the union and piping. 
(c) Select and attach the faucet. 
A disadvantage of the simple system of water supply just 
described (Fig. 400) is that the pump must be operated when- 
ever water is desired. With comparatively little additional 
expense or labor, an overhead storage tank may be installed. 
This tank can be filled when convenient and water will then 
flow from the sink faucet at any time until the tank is empty. 
It is not necessary, as is often supposed, to use one pipe from 
the pump to the tank and another from the tank to the faucet. 
A single line of pipe will serve for both supply and discharge 
(Fig. 415). 
The simple gravity system (Fig. 415) furnishes a supply of 
cold water at the faucet. The tank can be pumped full every 
day, making running water available at any time. When the 
pump is located at the sink fresh water may be had by opening 
the faucet on the pump and pumping water directly from the 
well. 
1. Install the tank.—(a) Select the type, size and shape of the

(c) Install the shut-off value and union.—For types of shut-off 
valves and their repair, see page 393. At the end of the pipe 
line, near the tank, install (Fig. 417) first a union, so that the 
tank may be easily 
disconnected from 
the line for repairs, 
and second a shut- 
off (globe or gate) 
valve (Fig. 444, EH, 
or F), the purpose 
of which is to enable 
the stored water to 
be shut off from the 
pipe lines in case of 
a leak in the lines. 
(d) Install the overflow or water gauge.—Storage tanks, 
especially when filled by mechanically driven pumps, should 
be provided with an overflow pipe sufficiently large to carry off 
the greatest amount of water entering the tank through the 
supply pipe, and they may be supplied with some type of 
gauge to show the position of the water level. This overflow 
may be led directly to the sink, for such an installation as that 
shown in Fig. 415, where it acts as tell-tale pipe; or, in some 
localities, it may. be led through the side of the house and the 
water allowed to waste. For an installation using a hand pump, 
the overflow pipe need not be as large as the supply pipe; 
whereas, for mechanically driven pumps, the overflow pipe 
should be larger than the supply pipe. The water from such 
an overflow may be wasted or piped to a stock tank or else- 
where. 
A gauge may be made of a cork or metal float connected by 
a chain over pulleys with a weight passing in front of a scale. 
This will indicate the water level in the storage tank at any 
time and will be convenient. 
2. Connect the pump with the overhead tank.—(a) Install 
the check valve.—For the types of check valves and the operation

and repair of check valves, see page 392. Having a force 
pump at the sink, run a line of 1-inch pipe first to a check valve 
(Figs. 418, 445). This is a fitting which will allow the water to 
pass in one direction only; the purpose of this is to prevent any 
water from the overhead tank passing back through the pump 
and into the well or cistern, should the valves leak. 
(b) Install the union and piping.—The next fitting (Figs. 
414, 418) isa union. The 
installation of this fitting 
makes it possible to re- 
move the pump easily in 
case of repairs, without 
tearing out a considerable 
part of the piping.

slipping the water front into 
place, replace the end plates 
or bricks (Fig. 423), and con- 
nect the water front with the 
hot-water boiler. 
The horizontal partition in 
the water front (Fig. 420)

such (Fig. 421) that it can take the place of either the back 
or front fire bricks of the stove and is known accordingly as 
a “water back ” or a “ water front.’ 
The action of a hot-water front is based upon the 
fact that as water 
becomes heated it 
becomes lighter, 
and, therefore, 
will rise above 
the cold water. If 
a circulating sys- 
tem of pipes and a 
tank is provided, 
the hot water will 
rise from the water 
front and enter the 
side or top of the 
storage tank, being 
replaced in the 
water front by cold 
water flowing in from the bottom of the tank.

(Fig. 425, b) for cleaning or draining and a union (Fig. 425, c) to 
enable the connection to be made and to permit repairs. 
Another connection for the faucet is shown in Fig. 456. Con- 
nect the upper opening of the water front with either the side 
opening or the top opening of the boiler (Fig. 425). Connection 
with the top opening is the preferable arrangement when hot 
water is desired quickly from a fire which is to burn only at 
intervals, as where wood is 
used for fuel or where a 
gas or an oil heater is 
used. 
4. Connect the range 
boiler with the water sys- 
tem.—Connect the 4-inch 
cold-water pipe from the 
supply tank (Fig. 419) with 
the range boiler at f (Fig. 
425); run the 43-inch hot- 
water pipe from g (Fig. 
425) over to the kitchen 
sink ‘and attach a faucet 
(Fig. 419). Note the two 
unions above the tank (Fig. 
425). In connecting the 
cold-water pipe to the range 
boiler, use a boiler fitting, l. 
This fitting is threaded 
both outside and inside at Fig. 425.—Connections with the Range 
Boiler and between the Range Boiler

  the lower end and termi-

upper end. Select a piece of j-inch pipe of proper length 
(pipe j is not usually extended below the side opening m) 
and in it near the top drill a small hole K to prevent 
siphoning. Screw the piece of pipe, j, into the lower end of 
this boiler fitting, insert it in the boiler, and then screw the 
 
-P-A-G-E-392
  372 A FARM WATER SYSTEM 
boiler fitting into place. At the union, connect the cold-water 
supply pipe. 
Principle of operation—There is now a complete circuit of 
pipes from the overhead storage tank (Fig. 419) to the boiler, 
from the bottom of the boiler to the bottom of the water front, 
from the top of the water front to the side of the boiler, and 
from the top of the boiler to the hot-water faucet. If this 
faucet is opened and there is no fire in the stove cold water will 
follow this path and issue from the hot-water faucet; while if 
the faucet is not opened there will be a pressure of water 
throughout this circuit because of the elevation ot the supply 
tank. 
If the fire is started, the water in the water front will be 
heated, and, becoming lighter, will pass out through the top 
opening and up into the range boiler and so to the top of it. 
Cold water, to displace the hot water passing from the water 
front, will enter the lower opening of the water front, passing 
to this opening from the bottom of the boiler. The circulation 
will continue in this manner, the hot water accumulating at the 
top of the range boiler, the coldest water always being at the 
bottom. The temperature of the water grades uniformly 
from the hottest at the top to the coldest at the bottom. 
If the hot-water faucet at the sink is opened, there is no 
obstruction in the lengthy but nevertheless complete path of 
pipes from the overhead storage tank. The cold water will 
pass through the supply pipe to the boiler and enter, not 
directly at the top, where the hot water is stored, but down 
through pipe j toward the bottom of the boiler. This elimi- 
nates the mixing of the cold water with the hot water and also 
prevents the cold water from passing directly out through the 
hot water pipes at the top to the faucet. This entering water 
will displace an equal amount of hot water and force it from 
the top of the boiler, through the pipe line, and to the hot- 
water faucet at the sink. The diameter of the hole, k, in pipe 
j, usually is $ inch. A rule sometimes used is that hole k 
should have a sectional area of about one-fourth the sectional 
 
-P-A-G-E-393
  
INSTALLING A BATHROOM 373 
area of pipe j. The purpose of this hole is to prevent the 
siphoning of the hot water from the boiler through the cold- 
water pipes when the overhead storage tank is completely 
emptied. When the water is lowered as far as k, air will enter 
and break the siphon. 
Our third simple system is now complete. Running hot 
and cold water may be had at the sink by merely opening the 
faucets (Fig. 419).

Tools and Equipment: See page 380. 
1. Plan the layout of the bathroom.—Select a room that is 
light and well ventilated, and see that heat, to prevent freezing, 
is in some way provided. While a furnace to heat the entire 
house is the most satisfactory arrangement, the installation of 
a bathroom need not be deferred for the furnace. Sufficient 
heat can usually be secured by means of some device, such as 
a register, cut through the ceiling of a lower room, a doorway 
opening from the kitchen, the use of an oil heater, or the range 
hot-water boiler as supplementary heat, or the installation of a 
separate coal-burning hot-water heater in the bathroom. 
Convenience in connecting the waste pipes with the disposal 
system is an item to be considered, but should not be given too 
much weight. As related to the water-supply system, the 
bathroom fixtures need be only 6 inches below the bottom of a 
gravity tank, although a greater distance is much more desir- 
able. This enables the tank to be located in the upper portion
-P-A-G-E-394
  
374 A FARM WATER SYSTEM 
of the bathroom or in a room near or adjoining. With a pres- 
sure system, almost any location will be satisfactory. The 
cost of labor and material for pipe lines should not, in general, 
stand in the way of the most desirable location for the bath- 
room. 
The system of waste pipes within the house may be sub- 
divided.into (1) the soil stack, that part of the drainage system 
extending vertically from the cellar through the roof; (2) the 
house drain, that part extending from the soil stack to the

used, while siphon traps may be used with the two-pipe system.

  376 A FARM WATER SYSTEM 
danger of siphon action by aspiration and siphon traps may, 
under such circumstances, be used in the single-pipe systems. 
The purpose of the vent stack is to prevent the siphoning of 
water from fixture traps by the passage of flush water through 
the soil stack from an upper fixture. The addition of the vent 
equalizes the pressure on both sides of the trap. Of course, if 
a non-siphoning trap (Figs. 437, 438) be used, this danger is 
eliminated. 
In two-pipe systems, the vent stack may extend through 
the roof or, for economy, may enter the soil stack above the 
highest fixture (Fig. 427). The vent stack is connected with 
the soil stack below the lowest fixture. This provides an outlet 
irom the vent stack for foreign matter that might collect. 
Where possible, the closet should be placed near the soil 
stack. The soil stack may or may not be exposed within the 
bathroom, but it should be so located as to afford convenient 
connections to the drain pipes entering it. It is best carried 
straight up through the roof, but may have an offset if neces- 
sary. 
The method of supporting the soil stack at its base will 
depend on whether the house drain is to be laid on, or below, 
or be suspended above, the cellar floor. This will depend 
largely on the location of the septic tank; and this, in turn, 
will be influenced by the contour of the ground. In any case, 
a firm support should be provided, so that there will be no 
danger of the soil pipe settling. If the house drain is to be run 
on or below the cellar floor, a support of brick, masonry, or 
concrete may be used; but if it is to be suspended on hangers, 
two should be used at the base of the soil stack, one on either 
side. 
a. Roof outlet—Where the soil stack extends through the 
roof of a building, never use a pipe of less than 4 inches diameter, 
as there is danger of small pipes becoming clogged with frost 
during cold weather. 
The opening around the vent stack, where it passes through 
the roof, must be made water-tight. This is accomplished by
-P-A-G-E-397
  INSTALLING A BATHROOM 377 
the use of flashings or roof flanges (Fig. 428). There are a 
number of different kinds of flashings on the market, all of 
which contain some sort of a collar, usually of lead, which fits 
around the soil pipe and which is fastened to a flange. The 
upper part of the flange is inserted under the roofing above 
and the lower part is fastened over the roofing below the soil 
stack. The joint between the 
collar and the pipe is made tight 
in several ways: (1) by working 
a beaded lead collar tightly 
around the pipe; (2) by calking 
with oakum and lead; (3) by using 
a rubber ring. Adjustable roof 
flashings may be purchased which 
will fit any pitch of roof. 
The house drain.—See that 
the house drain is firmly sup- 
ported at intervals of about 10 i 3 
feet. Locate supports near the EG aos oN ce oe ; Joint between the Soil Pipe 
hubs and under all branch fittings and the Roof Flange. 
for riser lines. If the house 
drain runs close to the floor, use brick, masonry, or concrete 
piers; if above the floor, use pipe hangers, or pipe brackets 
screwed to the wall by expansion bolts; if run near the ceiling 
use iron pipe hangers supported from overhead. 
a. Size.—The house drain should not be smaller than the 
outlet from the largest fixture discharging into the drainage 
system. The discharge opening from a water-closet varies 
from 24 to 3 inches, and the house drain should be at least 4 
inches in diameter. 
b. Fall—It has been found that a rate of flow of between 
180 feet and 300 feet a minute is desirable for house sewage. 
Since the friction in smaller pipes is greater than in large, a 
greater fall is necessary for small pipes in order to secure the 
desired velocity. Briefly, the rule may be stated as follows: 
For each foot of fall in the drain, allow a length of 10 feet of 
   
-P-A-G-E-398
378 A FARM WATER SYSTEM 
pipe for each inch of diameter of the pipe. For 4-inch pipe 
this gives a fall of approximately + inch to the foot. 
c. Clean-outs.—Where the soil stack enters the house drain, 
locate a clean-out plug in the horizontal opening of the drainage 
fitting (Figs. 426, 427). It is very good practice, wherever 
possible, to provide clean-out openings at other important 
angles in the lines. 
d. Traps.—In every house drain, a main, or running, trap 
should be installed to prevent air from the sewer pipe from 
passing back up through the soil stack. This trap may be 
located just inside of the cellar wall (Fig. 427) or just outside 
(Fig. 426). In Fig. 426, the air-vent pipe is run at least 8 inches 
above ground from the vent hub and capped. The objection 
to this system is that the trap is inaccessible. In Fig. 427, since 
the running trap is inside the cellar wall, it is easy of access for 
cleaning; and since the vent pipe is not straight, there is little 
danger of cold air currents entering to freeze the trap. There 
are a number of other arrangements possible which are not here 
considered. 
Where the pipe passes through the cellar wall leave an 
opening, large enough to allow the wall to settle slightly without 
affecting the pipe. 
Make the connection between the house drain and the 
sewer outside of the cellar wall, and cement the joint tightly. 
Branch fixture connections.—There are many ways of con- 
necting the drainage fittings of the bathtub and lavatory with the 
soil stack, and some of these are shown in Figs. 426, 427, and 
439. In Fig. 427, the toilet is connected with a branch line of 
4-inch soil pipe. The lavatory drain enters this branch line 
nearer the soil stack, while the bathtub drain enters inde- 
pendently and from the other side. In Fig. 426, the toilet is 
shown connected with the soil stack by a long bend, the lavatory 
drain entering the side of this bend while the bathtub drain 
enters independently at the opposite side of the soil stack. In 
Fig. 489, the lavatory and bathtub drains are brought together 
and join the soil stack by a 2-inch opening in the side of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-399
  INSTALLING A BATHROOM 379 
4-inch sanitary T-Y fitting which receives the closet bend. 
By the use of various drainage fittings many other arrange- 
ments are possible. 
Soil pipe.—Cast-iron pipe is used in the system of waste 
. pipes, as it is more economical than wrought iron or steel. Cast- 
iron soil pipe, which may be obtained either plain or coated, is 
made in two weights, standard and extra heavy. The coated 
pipe, which has less frictional resistance and a longer life, is made 
by covering both the inside and outside with a coat of pitch or 
asphalt, applied hot. The standard weight is used, when 
permitted, in two-story buildings in the city and very generally 
in country plumbing. Care must be used to avoid cracking 
standard pipe when calking the joints. 
Soil pipe comes in 5-foot lengths and in 2-inch, 3-inch, 
4-inch, 5-inch, 6-inch, and even larger sizes, the 2-inch and 
4-inch being usually selected for use in average houses, the 
2-inch for laterals other than to toilets and the 4-inch for the 
main lines. 
Drainage fittings of cast iron are made in such a large 
number of shapes that lack of space prevents a consideration 
of them here. Any catalog on plumbing will contain illustra- 
tions and descriptions sufficient to enable one to select those 
suitable for any specific installation. 
2. Select the bathroom fixtures.—The room available as a 
bathroom is next to the kitchen and to the left. It is 10 feet 
long and 6 feet wide. The first problem is to select the bathtub, 
lavatory, and water-closet, and to decide upon their location. 
The variety of bathroom fixtures, as to materials of con- 
struction, finish, design, and size, is so large that it is obviously 
impossible, in a chapter of this length, to discuss them ade- 
quately. The selection will vary according to the pocketbook, 
the individual taste, and the room available. Bathtubs may 
be obtained in standard sizes, the usual overall lengths being 
45, 5, and 53 feet. The usual width, over all, is 30 inches, 
but narrow tubs are made and their use may help solve some 
difficult problem. The average lavatory is 24 inches wide and 
 
-P-A-G-E-400
380 A FARM WATER SYSTEM. 
extends out from the wall 18 inches, while the average water- 
closet tank is 24 inches wide and the front edge of the bowl is 
about 28 inches from the wall. By purchasing either a 43- or 
5-foot tub, these three fixtures can be placed along one side of a 
10-foot room. Our plan, in this case, calls for the bathtub to 
be located at the left, the water-closet at the right, and the 
lavatory between the two, as shown in the cut. 
Tools.—In addition to the tools listed for putting a water 
system in the kitchen, the following will be needed for handling 
soil pipes:

3. Put in the soil stack—The soil stack (Fig. 431) is to be 
located in the right-hand corner of this bathroom. 
Starting in the bathroom, cut a circular hole in the floor 
where the soil pipe is to be located. With the aid of a plumb 
bob, find the centers of the holes to be cut in the ceiling above. 
Working from the base upwards, support the soil stack at each 
floor with iron hangers fastened to the side walls or floor joists. 
Starting at the base, use a Y or a T-Y fitting, preferably a 
Y, where the soil stack connects with the house drain. Hither 
of these fittings is better than an ell, as a clean-out plug can be 
 
-P-A-G-E-401

calked in the horizontal opening (Figs. 426, 427, 429, 431). This 
will provide access to the house drain for cleaning. From this 
Y or T-Y fitting, extend the pipe vertically to the place where 
the first branch fixture connection is to enter the soil stack. 
At this point, calk the necessary drainage fitting in place and 
continue the soil stack upward, locating the other necessary 
drainage fittings and then extending the pipe from 12 to 18 
inches beyond the roof. Construct a masonry pier on the 
ground under the hole in the bathroom floor, to support the soil

stack. In the present instance, the ground and the bathroom 
floor are so close together that a vertical length of soil pipe is 
not needed between the drainage fitting at the base of the soil 
stack and the drainage fitting which takes the toilet wastes. 
The spigot of the toilet-waste drainage fitting is therefore calked 
into the hub of the base fitting of the soil stack. These may be 
assembled outside and installed later. 
Calk in the clean-out plug.—Calk the body of the clean-out 
ferrule (Fig. 429, a), which may be made of brass or cast iron, 
into the horizontal opening of the T-Y fitting at the base of the

    soil stack. The plug (Fig. 429, b) for a clean-out ferrule, usually 
of brass, should have a nut, so that it may be tightened or 
loosened with a wrench.

zontal opening (Fig. 430, a) of the sanitary T-Y fitting (Fig. 
431), and the waste pipe from the bathtub and lavatory into the 
2-inch inlet (Fig. 430, 6). As this 2-inch inlet is not threaded 
for pipe, and as the pipe from the bath and lavatory wastes is 
only 12 inches, a 13-inch threaded coupling or bushing must be 
 
-P-A-G-E-403
  OTHER TOOLS FOR HANDLING SOIL PIPE 383 
calked (see page 383) into the 2-inch opening. By using one 
of the various soil-pipe fittings with side openings threaded for 
screwed pipe, this extra work will be unnecessary. A 13-inch 
street ell may now be screwed into this inlet (Figs. 429, 430, 
431) and later a waste line run from the ell to the fixtures. 
The soil stack.—Install these assembled drainage fittings 
on the masonry support. Calk all joints 
well. See that the soil stack is sup- 
ported at cach floor and is continued 
upward and through the roof. At the 
roof, use an -adjustable roof flange. 
Make the joint tight around the pipe, 
and make the joint between roof and

(2) Having made very sure that there is no moisture 
present, pour melted lead, free from solder or other metals 
into the joint (Fig. 433). The joint must be run full at the 
first pouring. If it is not, the lead must be picked out and the 
joint repoured. Be sure that the joint is free from moisture 
before pouring the lead, as otherwise its boiling, caused by the 
hot lead, will, in turn, spatter the lead, and serious burns 
may result and eyesight be endangered. Keep the face back.

Fia. 434.—Packing the Cold Lead in Place with a Calking Chisel and a

(3) As the lead cools it contracts, and it must therefore be 
packed or calked in place by means of a calking chisel and 
hammer (Fig. 434). Calking expands the lead against the pipe 
and hub, which, together with the oakum, makes a gas- and 
water-tight joint. Care should be used in calking the lead, as 
considerable pressure is brought to bear upon the hub and it 
may easily be cracked. It is usually best, with light pipes, 
not to expand all the lead but to calk along the edges only. 
When pouring a horizontal soil-pipe joint, it is necessary to 
use some material to guide and hold the lead in the joint while 
 
-P-A-G-E-405
  
OTHER TOOLS FOR HANDLING SOIL PIPE 385 
pouring and until cool. Putty or soft clay is sometimes used 
for this purpose. The quickest and probably the best method, 
however, is to use an asbestos joint runner, as shown in Fig. 435. 
This asbestos runner is clamped tightly to the soil pipe, close to 
the hub. The 
clamp is so shaped 
as to form a funnei 
through which to 
pour the melted 
lead. Upon remoy- 
ing the asbestos, 
the lead is calked 
as previously de- 
scribed.

Cut the soil pipe—TIn 
erecting the soil stack, it 
may be necessary to cut 
one or more lengths of the 
soil pipe. To do this, the 
tools commonly used are a 
  steel cold chisel and a hammer. Mark the soil pipe with 
chalk where it is to be cut and lay it on some solid surface, 
putting a piece of wood under the mark (Fig. 436). Cut the

pipe lightly around on the mark with the chisel and continue 
cutting until the pipe breaks apart. 
4, Put in the house drain.—Having completed the soil 
stack, run the house drain 
from the soil stack (Fig. 
426) through the cellar wall 
to the running trap. See 
that this drain is well sup- 
ported (page 377) is given 
the proper grade (page 377), 
and has all joints well sealed 
by lead or soil-pipe cement. 
Then install the vertical 
vent (Figs. 426, 427 and

house drain with the vitri-

the water pipes.—The bathroom fixtures,

desirable to do all the pumping with the hand force pump such as 
has been here shown. Accordingly, this may be replaced by a 
double-acting hand pump or by an engine-driven or motor-driven 
pump. The installation of any of these pumps will require very 
few changes in the plumbing. Always the suction side of the 
pump, whether located in the kitchen or in an adjoining room, 
must be connected with the suction line from the well; and 
the discharge side of the pump must be connected with the 
storage tank. In all cases the check valve should be located as 
previously shown, in the discharge line near the pump. 
If desired later, any of the systems for supplying water to 
the fixtures, such as a hillside reservoir, a wind-mill, a ram, a 
water wheel driving a pump, a hydro-pneumatic tank, or a 
pneumatic tank and a pump can be installed. The changes in 
the piping will be few, for with the fixtures once in and the 
drainage system completed, the major part of any water- 
system is done. The fact that a simple gravity system is first 
installed does not preclude a later change to any other of the 
numerous types of water systems. It does, however, pro- 
vide a means of additional health, comfort, and labor saving 
until a more complete system for supplying the water can 
be installed. 
GENERAL INFORMATION 
Water valves: 
A water valve is a mechanical device, the purpose of which 
is to prevent or permit the passage of water through a line of 
pipe. The term cock, although originally applied only to a 
rotary valve or spigot, is now generally applied to those valves 
that are used at the end of a line for drawing water. These 
valves are also commonly called spigots or faucets. The 
stopcock with a waste opening, however, is an exception. 
The stop-and-waste cock.—If a house is to be left during 
the winter months, even though for but a short period, it is _ 
necessary that the water shall be turned off from the house — 
 
-P-A-G-E-411
  GENERAL INFORMATION ON FARM WATER SYSTEMS 391 
pipes. This alone is not sufficient, however. The water in the 
pipes within the house must be drained. In repairing, like- 
wise, it becomes necessary to turn off the water pressure from 
the house pipes and then to drain the water from them. In 
either of these cases a shut-off valve might be used in the 
house supply line to close off the pressure, and a faucet at some 
low place to drain the pipes. A stop-and-waste cock, would, 
however, serve the purpose of these two fittings. This type of 
cock (Fig. 444, A) is essentially like the ground-key bibcock 
(Fig. 448, D) except that it is so constructed that when it is in 
the shut-off position the opening x (Fig. 444, A) is brought into 
connection with the pipe in the left-hand side of the cock and 
aseldd- Fia. 444.—Water Valves. 
al 
allows water to drain from the pipe lines beyond. This fitting 
should be located at some low place in the supply line, near the 
pressure tank or the place where the supply pipe enters the 
house. 
The hydrant cock.—The hydrant cock is a very useful valve 
for controlling the flow of water into buildings or tanks sub- 
jected to low temperatures. It is located in the supply line 
underground, where it will not freeze. It is essentially a stop- 
and-waste cock with the discharge end bent upward and con- 
nected by a pipe to supply, for instance, a stock- or poultry- 
watering trough. The lever controlling the cock is extended 
above the ground. Opening the valve allows the water from 
the supply line to pass up into the watering trough, wlule 
 
-P-A-G-E-412
392 A FARM WATER SYSTEM 
closing it shuts off the supply of water at the valve and also 
drains the pipe between the trough and the valve. In heavy 
soils at least 6 inches of cinders should be placed around the 
pipes to facilitate drainage. 
Check valves.—There are certain points in a water system, 
such as in the discharge line near the pump, back of which it is 
undesirable to allow the water to return. At these points 
check valves should be used. Because of their construction it 
is very essential that care be exercised in their installation so 
that they will function properly. 
There are two main types of 
check valves, and three forms— 
vertical; horizontal, and angular. 
In all of these the moving parts 
are so located as to be easy of 
access in case of repair. 
The lift check valve-—In the 
lift type of check valve (Fig. 
Fie. 445.—A Lift Check Valve. 444, B, and Fig. 445) a rests on b by gravity when the pressure 
on both sides is equal. If the pressure is greater on side x, the 
check, a, will be lifted and water will pass through the check 
valve; but if the pressure at x drops, the back pressure from y 
will force the check, a, shut. It is 
therefore evident that water can Y*9 
be forced through in only one 
direction,—namely, from x to y. b 
The water passing through this 
valve must make two right-angled 
turns and pass through an open- * a. y 
ing whose area is smaller than the 
area of the main opening to the 
valve, thus encountering con- 
siderable resistance. 
The swing check valve—In this 
swing check valve (Fig. 446) the check, a, works on the are   
  
    
    
      
  
Fic. 446.—The Swing Check 
Valve. 
 
-P-A-G-E-413
     GENERAL INFORMATION ON FARM WATER SYSTEMS 393 
of a circle instead of rising vertically. The check plate, a, 
is loosely connected at its center to an arm pivoted at b, so 
that it is free to swing away from the opening. This check 
yields to pressure from one direction, x, and allows the water 
to pass through, while if the pressure be reversed, the check 
is forced against the stop and the water cannot pass back 
through. In this valve the water has a straightaway opening 
of almost the same size as the valve and there is but little 
resistance to its passage. 
The angle check valve-—The operation of the angle check 
valve shown in Fig. 444, C, is the same as that of the lift check 
valve previously described. 
Shut-off valves.—It is very desirable at times to prevent 
the passage of water from one part of a water system to another, 
or from a supply line to a certain fixture, or from an overhead 
storage tank to the supply lines. For such conditions a shut-off 
valve of either the globe (Fig. 444, #) or the gate (Fig. 444, 
F) type should be used. 
The globe-valve type——By turning the handle of the globe 
valve, the disk (Fig. 444, E, a) which may be a brass disk or a 
renewable soft disk, is lowered until it presses against the seat, 
b, thus cutting off the flow through the valve. The correct 
direction for the flow of water through the valve is, in Fig. 444, 
EL, from x to y. If the water is allowed to flow through in the 
other direction, the pressure will be acting against the packing 
in the stuffing box, c, when the valve is closed, so that this 
packing cannot be renewed without first removing pressure 
from the entire line. If, however, the flow is from 2 to y, then 
the closing of the valve will cut off the pressure from the main 
body of the valve and permit the renewal of the packing at any 
time. The same objections may be raised against this valve 
as against the vertical check valve,—namely, that the water in 
passing through must make two right-angled turns and pass 
through a restricted opening. When installing this valve 
(Fig. 444, £) in a horizontal pipe, it is best to have it on its side 
rather than vertical, so that when the pipes are drained none of 
    
-P-A-G-E-414
   
   394 A FARM WATER SYSTEM 
the water will be pocketed in them by the seat partition in the 
valve. 
The angle valve.—The angle valve (Fig. 444, D), a modifica- 
tion of the globe valve, is used largely in controlling the water 
supply tc separate fixtures. It serves two functions: it acts 
as a valve and it changes the direction of the flow. Like globe 
valves, it is made with disks either of soft material or of brass. 
The gate-valve type.—The gate valve (Fig. 444, F'), because of 
its construction, offers radically less resistance to flow than 
does the globe type; but it is not so durable as the latter and 
is not so generally used. Turning the handle lowers the double- 
faced wedge-shaped gate, a, so that the gate is pressed against 
the two faces, b, b’, thus making a double seal and closing the 
valve. In such a valve either end may be used as the intake.

  Fie, 447.—Water Cocks. 
Faucets.—In the plumbing trade, water faucets are known 
as bibcocks, and of these there are three general types. In Fig. 
447, A and B, the compression type is shown. Figure 447, C, 
shows the Fuller type, and Fig. 447, D, the ground-key bibeock. 
Each of these types is further classified as being a plain bib, if 
the spout is not threaded for a hose connection (Fig. 447, C), 
and as a hose bib, if it is threaded for hose connection (Fig. 
447, D). These threads for hose connections are not standard 
pipe threads. The method of attaching bibcocks to a pipe line 
is also indicated by the name, those having threads being known 
as screw joint and those finished for a soldered joint as solder 
joint. All of those shown in Fig. 447 are screw joints. Techni- 
cally speaking, then, Fig. 447, B, is a plain screw-joint compres- 
sion bib; Fig. 447, C, a plain screw-joint Fuller bib; and Fig. 447,

The compression bib—The common type of compression bib 
is shown in Fig. 448, B, and in Fig. 449. In Figs. 448, B, and 449, 
b, is a soft disk packing, easily removable in case of leak. A

piece of leather will serve as a temporary repair, though the 
regular disk is usually of composition rubber. By turning the 
handle, a, the disk is forced down against a seat in c, thus 
shutting off the water supply. Lifting the disk opens the 
faucet. As the disk closes the faucet against pressure, its 
action is similar to that of a globe valve (Fig. 444, Z). At d 
there is a stuffing box with packing, the purpose of which is to 
prevent a leakage of water past the stem. 
The Hajoca bib.—The Hajoca bib (Fig. 448, A) is of the same 
general type as the ordinary com- 
pression bib, closing against the 
pressure of the water. Part b 
carries the soft disk packing which 
is easily replaced. Part b fits into, 
and is supported in, the spout, c. 
Spout ¢ screws on to part a, which 
contains the seat against which 
the packing on piece b_ bears.

packing against its seat, thus 
shutting off the water supply. The

the spout and is held in almost 
any position by a set screw. This is a very simple bib, so 
constructed as to eliminate the packing and stuffing box used 
on the other common compression bibs. 
The Fuller bib—The Fuller bib (Figs. 448, C, and 450) closes 
with the pressure of the water instead of against it. The 
packing, or plug, a, which is ball-shaped, is connected with the 
eccentric, c, of the faucet stem. When the faucet is closed the 
packing, a, is drawn into a seat or beveled opening at d, thus 
closing with the pressure. Packing is placed around the stem 
to prevent the leakage of water and is held tightly in place by a 
cap screw and a collar, 6. Referring to Fig. 448, C, it can be

seen that in case this faucet leaks, it may be repaired by unscrew- 
ing it at the joint near the plug and removing the plug. New 
ones may be obtained from dealers and substituted. This 
type, however, is not generally as durable as the compression 
bib. 
The ground-key bib.—The construction of the ground-key 
bib is shown in Fig. 448, D, and Fig. 451. The plug, a, pierced 
by the opening, 6, is ground to a water-tight fit in the body, c. 
Turning the lever a quarter of a turn opens or closes the faucet.

Size.—With high water pressures, the use of a quick-closing 
faucet results in a harmful pounding of the water. Because 
of the fact that a compression type faucet cannot be closed 
suddenly, they are recommended for pressures of over 40 
pounds. For lower pressures the Fuller or the ground-key 
type may be used. The size of the faucet selected also depends 
somewhat on the pressure, ?-inch being recommended for low 
pressures and }-inch for the higher pressures. 
WATER PIPES 
In selecting pipes for conveying water for drinking purposes, 
consideration must be given to their effect on health, their 
durability, their liability to become clogged, and their first cost.  
-P-A-G-E-418
398 A FARM WATER SYSTEM 
Lead pipe.—Pipes of this material have long been used in 
hilly regions for conveying spring water by gravity to the house 
and barns. They have been durable, have not become clogged 
from rust, and being usually small in diameter were not very 
expensive to purchase. Water was almost always allowed to 
flow through them continuously so as to have it cold at the 
house in summer and to prevent its freezing in winter. If 
water stands long in lead pipes it may gather enough lead salts 
to render it unfit for home use, and it is well known that very 
small amounts of lead are fatal to young calves. Nowadays 
the excessive cost of all but small sizes usually precludes the 
use of lead for piping. 
Wrought-iron pipe.—The primitive methods long employed 
for refining iron for the manufacture of pipe produce what is 
known as wrought iron; and this metal remains to-day as the 
standard for durability and slowness of rusting. The process 
of manufacture is such that when the metal is drawn out into 
pipes it carries, all through the body of the iron, thin sheets of 
rolled-out melted stone, or slag, which are thought to be 
responsible for the fact that rusting affects this kind of metal 
very slowly and practically never works down into deep pits, 
as it will in Bessemer steel. However, rust does form a red 
layer inside ungalvanized pipe, and this flavors the drinking 
water and is objectionable in the laundry. Galvanized pipe 
should therefore be used. Its cost is usually about 40 per cent 
higher than that of ordinary galvanized steel pipe, but many 
consider it worth the difference. The names of the better- 
known brands are molded in the metal of the pipe every few 
feet, thus making it very easy to identify the genuine article. 
Steel pipe.—Steel such as is used in bridges and steel build- 
ings is produced quite cheaply and is used largely for making 
gas and water pipes, both black and galvanized. However, 
because of its rapid rusting in deep pits, it is expensive, even at 
a low cost, and often gives trouble by clogging with rust. One 
large company is now manufacturing a steel pipe in which the 
metal has been treated by a special process, and claims that this
-P-A-G-E-419
  GENERAL INFORMATION ON FARM WATER SYSTEMS 399 
pipe is fully as durable and as rust-resistant as the old-fashioned 
wrought-iron pipe. This new pipe also carries a trade name 
molded in the metal. 
Wooden pipe.—From the very earliest times hollow logs 
have been used as water pipes. Some have lasted in good con- 
dition for as long as thirty or forty years. To-day a number of 
concerns are making wooden pipe in sizes of 1-inch diameter 
and larger, either plain for low pressures or reinforced for high 
pressures. The tenon-and-socket joints can be put together 
without special tools, and fittings for branches or for attaching 
  
  Fig. 452.—Full-sized }-inch Pipe and Fittings. 
_ to metal pipe can be readily obtained. Wood has no effect on 
the water passing through it, and the pipe becomes, with use, 
smoother on the inside than when new. Water does not freeze 
in it as readily as in iron; and it is claimed that even if the 
water is frozen, the pipe, on account of the elasticity of the 
wood, does not burst. As the pipe is light, transportation 
charges are low and the price is usually less than for galvanized 
steel pipe. It must be remembered, however, that, to be 
durable, wooden pipe must at all times be wet or damp, both 
inside and out. It is accordingly unsuitable for use above 
ground, where an extension of metal pipe should be used. 
Neither should it be laid through very dry, gravelly soil where 
the outside will not always be damp. Moreover, the roots of
-P-A-G-E-420
400 A FARM WATER SYSTEM 
water-loving trees may enter the joints of wooden pipe laid 
near them. But on the whole, wooden pipe is very desirable 
for long supply lines. 
Sizes.—The size of wrought-iron or steel pipe is determined, 
not by its outside diameter, but by its nominal inside diameter. 
The pipe size will usually correspond very closely to the actual 
inside diameter of the pipe, as shown in Fig. 452 and in Table 8. 
The relation between pipe and pipe fitting is shown in Fig. 452. 
The dimensions of the openings of a }-inch elbow are approxi- 
mately ? inch. This is because the size of a pipe fitting is 
determined by the outside diameter of the pipe which will fit 
into it. The outside diameter of a 4-inch pipe is about ? inch.

Friction in water pipes.—The loss of head resulting from 
pipe friction, while not of great importance in the simple water 
systems discussed in this book, nevertheless rightfully belongs 
under a discussion of water pipes and therefore will be briefly 
considered. 
When water flows through pipes there is friction between
-P-A-G-E-421
  GENERAL INFORMATION ON FARM WATER SYSTEMS 401 
the water and the pipe walls, and energy is required to over- 
come this friction. Friction will vary according to the following 
three laws: 
(1) Frictional resistance varies directly as the length of the 
pipe. : 
(2) Frictional resistance varies inversely as the diameter of 
the pipe. 
(3) Frictional resistance varies almost directly as the 
square of the velocity and is entirely independent of 
pressure. 
That is to say, the longer the pipe, the greater is the friction; 
the larger the pipe, the less is the friction; and the faster the 
water flows, the greater is the friction. The loss of head through 
a 90°-elbow of less than a 2-inch diameter is equivalent to the 
loss in a straight piece of pipe of the same diameter and of a 
length of from 10 to 20 feet. 
As the suction lifting power of a pump is a fairly constant 
factor, it is important that the friction loss in the suction pipe 
be computed, especially when a long horizontal pipe is used. 
When water is to be pumped a long distance, this friction loss 
virtually increases, by just so much, the vertical height against 
which the pump must operate. When water is flowing through 
a long line of pipe from an elevated tank or spring, some of the 
pressure due to the elevation of the source is used in overcoming 
this friction, and reduced pressure at the faucet results. Where 
the available head is small, it is very important that this pipe 
friction be computed so that the proper size of pipe may be 
selected. This may be computed from Table 9. 
To illustrate the manner of using Table 9, let us consider 
the two following examples: 
Example 1: We wish to install a pump at the kitchen sink, 
as shown in Fig. 400. Suppose the pump we select can pump 
5 gallons a minute and has a 1}-inch suction pipe. The well is 
100 feet from the house and the water in the well is 12 feet 
below the surface of the ground. Under these conditions, can
-P-A-G-E-422
  402 A FARM WATER SYSTEM 
water be pumped at the sink? We know that the suction lift 
of a pump is limited to from 20 to 25 feet. What is the equiva- 
lent lift under these conditions? Evidently, it is 12 feet plus 
the height of the top of the pump cylinder above the ground, 
say 6 feet, plus the equivalent friction head, in feet, in the pipe. 
Since the pump is sucking only half the time, we must assume 
the rate of flow from the well as being at the rate of at least 
10 gallons a minute. Referring to Table 9, we find that, for 
every 100 feet of 1}-inch pipe carrying 10 gallons of water a 
minute, there is a frictional loss in feet of 3.05. The total 
length of suction pipe will therefore be 100-+12+6=118 feet. 
This would mean a frictional resistance of 3.6 feet. There are 
two elbows and the frictional resistance of a 14-inch elbow is 
figured as equal to about 10 feet of straight pipe. Allowing 
10 feet for each elbow, then, we have an additional friction loss 
of .20X3.05 feet, or. 60 foot. Adding the actual vertical head 
to the friction head gives us a total lift of 18+3.6+.60=22.20 
feet. It is therefore evident that the pump will work at the 
sink. Suppose, however, that the water in the well at dry 
seasons dropped to a level of 18 feet below the ground. Our 
vertical lift now is 24 feet, which is within the vertical suction 
distance of a pump, but our total lift, when friction loss is added, 
is 28.20 feet. Under these conditions the pump would prob- 
ably not work satisfactorily if located at the sink. 
Example 2: Suppose now that we have a pump of the same 
capacity delivering water through a l-inch pipe to an empty 
storage tank on a hillside 30 feet above, and 600 feet away from, 
the pump. The actual lift is 30 feet, but the pump must be 
supplied with power sufficient to pump it higher, for as we have 
seen, the total lift is made up of the vertical head plus the fric- 
tion head. Referring to Table 9, we find that for every 100 
feet of 1-inch pipe carrying 5 gallons of water a minute, there is 
a friction loss of 3.25 feet; and for 630 feet this would approxi- 
mate a friction loss of 21 feet. This means that, of the power 
necessary to operate the pump, about 60 per cent is used to 
elevate the water to the reservoir, and 40 per cent, to overcome

first example, the pipe friction meant the difference between a 
pump working or not working; while in the second example, 
the installation of a 14-inch instead of a 1-inch pipe considerably 
decreased the power necessary to operate the pump. This 
table will, in a like manner, prove useful in the solution of hun- 
dreds of other water-supply problems. 
PIPE FITTINGS 
When it is necessary to join together two lengths of pipe, to 
change the direction of a line of pipe, to take a branch from a 
main line, or to change the size of a line of pipe, and so forth, 
pipe fittings are used. These fittings are already threaded 
when purchased and are made of malleable iron or cast iron. 
The malleable-iron fittings are commonly used on the sizes of 
wrought-iron pipe from } inch to 2 inches and the cast-iron 
fittings on the sizes from # inch to 4 inches. 
There are a number of different pipe fittings, some of which 
are shown in Fig. 453. It can readily be seen that a great 
variety of pipe arrangements is made possible by the use of 
these fittings, the purposes of most of which are self-evident. 
The tee.—The tee is a fitting used where it is desired to 
take a branch from the main line. A plain tee (Fig. 453, B) has 
all the openings of the same size. A reducing tee (Fig. 453, A, 
C, D) has one or more of the openings of a smaller size. 
In ordering a reducing tee like those shown in Fig. 453, A, 
C, and D, it is well to remember that the sizes for the “run ” 
are always given first and then the size of the branch, as for 
example, the fitting shown in Fig. 453, A, would be ordered as a 
malleable reducing tee, 1 inch X} inch X inch, and Fig. 453, C, 
as a malleable reducing tee, 1 inchX1 inch X}4 inch. 
The elbow.—The elbow is a fitting used to change the 
direction of a run of pipe. Elbows are of three kinds, the plain 
ell, the reducing ell, and the street ell. The plain ell (Fig. 453, 
L) is one having both openings the same size. A reducing ell, as 
shown in Fig. 453, K, has one opening smaller than the other.
-P-A-G-E-425
  GENERAL INFORMATION ON FARM WATER SYSTEMS 405 
Elbows are made with a 90°- (Fig. 453, L) or a 45°-turn (Fig. 
453, M). 
The street elbow.—The street elbow (Fig. 453, J) is one hay- 
ing inside threads for one opening and outside threads for the 
other. This fitting is used where it is desired to make a close

elbow connection, as with a water front or a boiler. The use of 
a street ell saves space and one fitting. 
The nipple——The term nipple is applied to short pieces of 
pipe threaded at both ends (Fig. 453, H, F,G@). A close nipple 
(Fig. 453, G) is one so short that the threads cut from either end 
meet at the center. A short nipple (Fig. 453, F) has at the 
center a small length of unthreaded pipe. Other nipples
-P-A-G-E-426
  406 A FARM WATER SYSTEM 
(Fig. 453, Z) come in various over-all lengths definitely specified 
in inches. Directions for cutting threads on nipples are the 
same as those for threading pipe. 
The crossover.—The use of the crossover (Fig. 453, H) 
makes it possible to cross two lines of pipe without bringing 
either out from the surface along the wall on which they 
run. 
The cross.—The cross (Fig. 453, J) is a rather unusual fitting 
used where it is desired to take opposite branches from a line 
at the same point. 
The cap and the plug.—The purpose of both the cap and the 
plug is the same: namely, to close the end of a run of pipe. 
The cap (Fig. 453, N), being threaded on the inside, is used 
when the run terminates as a threaded pipe, while the plug 
(Fig. 453, O), being threaded on the outside, is used when the 
run terminates in a fitting. 
The coupling.—This fitting (Fig. 453, P) is used when two 
lengths of pipe are to be connected together. Plain couplinge 
may be had when it is desired to connect two pipes of the same 
size, or reducing couplings where two pipes of different sizes 
are to be joined. 
The bushing.—A bushing (Fig. 453, Q) is generally used 
when it is necessary to make a reduction directly from a 
threaded opening. A bushing has both outside and inside 
threads. 
The floor, or wall, plate—The plate (Fig. 453, R), while not 
rightly a pipe fitting, is used extensively wherever plumbing is 
done. Its purpose is to give a neat and finished appearance to 
pipes passing through a wall or floor, 
GRAVITY STORAGE TANKS 
For systems of water supply where the force of gravity is 
used to provide the necessary pressure, some sort of an elevated 
tank is necessary. This tank may be located on a hillside 
above the house, on a tower, in a hayloft, in the attic, or in
-P-A-G-E-427
  GENERAL INFORMATION ON FARM WATER SYSTEMS 407 
any other place of an elevation higher than that of the 
fixtures. 
Elevation.—For short lengths of delivery pipe, a minimum 
elevation above the highest fixture of 10 feet is recommended, 
although as little as 6 inches will suffice. The greater the 
friction to be overcome in forcing the water through long 
lengths of delivery pipes or through small pipes, the higher 
must be the elevation of the tank to secure sufficient pressure 
at the fixtures (Table 9, page 403). 
The wooden tank.— Wooden tanks, either set up or knocked 
down, may be purchased. If the opening to the attic is too 
small to admit the set-up tank, a knocked-down one may be 
procured and assembled in the attic. 
Concrete and other tanks.—Concrete tanks are usually 
used on a hillside. Both metal-lined wooden tanks and metal 
tanks are used when the reservoir is in the house or is located 
above ground out-of-doors. The former, however, are most 
commonly used for inside, and the latter for outside installa- 
tions. 
The metal tank.—The metal tanks are usually of galvanized 
iron or steel, those made of galvanized wrought iron being 
preferable. They may be obtained set up or knocked down. 
During warm weather moisture collects on the outside of metal 
tanks, unless insulated, especially where very cold water is 
stored. To prevent this condensed moisture from dripping 
and wetting the ceiling below, a drip pan should be installed 
under all metal tanks. This pan may be connected with the 
overflow pipe from the tank or piped to a sink or to some other 
convenient outlet. 
Size—The size of the tank will depend upon three things: 
first, the quantity of water needed each day; second, the source 
of power for pumping the water; and third, the location of the 
tank. Investigation has shown that under average country 
conditions the daily consumption of water for people and stock 
is as shown in Table 10.

The use of Table 10 is necessary for the computation of the 
storage capacity required for a reserve supply. The amount of 
reserve supply desirable will vary, according to the kind of 
power used for pumping, from five days, for a windmill, and 
one, two, or three days for a gas engine, to one day or less for a 
ram, an electric, or a hand pump. 
The weight of an average day’s supply of water for a family 
of five is between 700 and 800 pounds. It is evident, therefore, 
that if the tank is located in the attic it is safer to install a 
smaller tank and pump more often than would be necessary if 
the tank were located on a hillside. As water weighs about 
4 pounds a gallon, or 62.5 pounds a cubic foot, the installation 
of an attic tank requires careful thought. This weight should 
be distributed as widely as possible so that the supports will be 
sufficiently strong. A long shallow tank distributes the weight 
over a greater area than a square or round tank of the same 
capacity and greater depth. If the tank is placed over wall 
partitions there is little chance of the floor joists bending 
downward and causing the plaster to crack. 
Common commercial sizes—The shape of attic storage tank 
most commonly used is the round-end oblong tank, as it is long 
and shallow and distributes the weight over a large area.

The capacity of round tanks may be computed as follows. 
Multiply the tank diameter in feet by itself; multiply this by

answer is the tank capacity in gallons. 
The capacity of a rectangular or square tank may be com- 
puted as follows. Multiply the width in feet by the length in 
feet by the depth in feet, and then the result by 7.48. The 
answer is the tank capacity in gallons. 7.48 is the number of 
gallons in one cubic foot. 
RANGE BOILERS 
Sizes.—Hot-water boilers, or range boilers, are metal tanks 
used to store the hot water from the water front or other heating 
device during the time when water is not being drawn, as well as 
to provide a supply of hot water during those periods when the
-P-A-G-E-430
  410 A FARM WATER SYSTEM 
water is being used faster than it is being heated. If the 
heater were called upon to supply hot water as fast as needed, a 
larger heater would be necessary than when thus using a range 
boiler in connection with the heater. 
Range boilers are made of steel, wrought iron, or copper. 
Wrought iron and steel boilers are made plain, painted, or 
galvanized. Either copper or galvanized boilers may be 
obtained in two grades, standard and extra heavy. The stand- 
ard grade galvanized boiler is usually marked “ tested 200 
pounds ”’ and rated to stand a working pressure from 100 to 
150 pounds, and the extra heavy is ordinarily marked “ tested 
for 250 pounds ” and rated to stand a working pressure up to 
200 pounds. Some manufacturers recommend a_ working 
pressure less than those listed here. Galvanized range boilers 
are commonly used and are galvanized both inside and out 
after being made. The process of galvanizing helps to make 
the joints and rivets water-tight, as during the process zinc is 
deposited on the metal surfaces. 
The three common sizes of galvanized range boilers are of 
30, 40, and 52 gallons capacity. 
The size of the range boiler will be governed by the capacity 
of the heater and by the number of gallons of hot water used. 
As previously stated, the ordinary range can accommodate a 
water front with a heating surface of 110 square inches exposed 
to the fire. Such a water front may be used with any boiler of 
from 30 to 52 gallons capacity. As the quantity of hot water 
used will vary with different families, it is rather difficult to 
establish an average. A 30-gallon boiler is probably as small 
as should be used, while a 52-gallon boiler should be large 
enough fora family of ten. In general, better results are secured 
with a moderate-sized heater and a large tank than with a large 
heater and a small tank. 
Arrangements.—When the question of a hot-water system 
for the kitchen was discussed previously in this book, only one 
location for the boiler was considered. There are times when 
other locations must be considered, and because of this, various 
 
-P-A-G-E-431
  GENERAL INFORMATION ON FARM WATER SYSTEMS 411 
other methods of connecting the range boiler with the water 
front will here be discussed. __ 
A range boiler may be installed in either a vertical or a hori- 
zontal position, and it is best located so that all or most of the 
tank is above the water front, as shown in Figs. 424, 454, and 
456. By using the specially arranged piping shown in Fig. 455, 
the tank may be located at a lower level, but this arrange- 
ment is not recommended. 
Connecting the flow pipe from the water front with the top 
of the boiler—If pipe d (Fig. 425) is extended and connected 
with the hot-water pipe just above 7, hot water will accumulate 
at the top of the boiler in 
a very short time. One 
reason for this is that in- 
creasing the length of pipe 
d increases the vertical 
height of the column of hot 
water, which is lighter, and 
as the circulation of water 
in the boiler and water front 
depends upon the difference 
in weight between the cold 
water and the hot water, a 
more rapid circulation will 
result. Another reason is 
that the hot water, in rising 
to the top of the tank, is 
not obliged to mingle with 
the unheated water on the 
way. 
Locating the boiler above 
the range-—One of the main 
factors to consider in any 
boiler installation is a good circulation of water. The speed 
of this circulation, as already stated, depends on the vertical 
height of the column of hot water. With the boiler installed

-P-A-G-E-432
412 A FARM WATER SYSTEM 
above the range (Fig. 454), it is a simple matter to get 
a longer column of hot water so that the weights of the 
two columns are sufficiently unbalanced. This will assure 
adequate circulation. The supply of cold water to the water 
front is taken from the bottom of the boiler and the hot-water 
pipe connects the water front with the top of the boiler or with 
the side, according to preference. 
Locating the boiler below the range.—If the boiler is located

Fig. 456.—Connection of the Range Boiler with Two Heaters.   
  below the range (Fig. 455), circulation can be obtained; but 
good circulation cannot always be depended upon, as the weights 
of the two columns of water are so nearly equal. As in the 
installation shown in Fig. 454, the cold-water supply is taken 
from the bottom of the range boiler. The hot-water pipe 
must be run vertically above the water front for a distance at 
least equal to the distance that the water front is above the 
bottom of the boiler. If this pipe can be extended even higher, 
 
-P-A-G-E-433
GENERAL INFORMATION ON FARM WATER SYSTEMS 413 
the resulting circulation will be more positive. For this arrange- 
ment, the hot-water connections to the faucets are not taken 
from the top of the boiler, but from the top of the circulation 
loop. 
Connecting the boiler with two heaters.—If two sources of 
heated water are available and it is desired to use both, either 
separately or together, the storage tank should be connected 
independently with each, as shown in Fig. 456. This same 
method of connecting should also be employed if both heaters 
are at the same level but one much farther from the boiler than 
the other. If so desired, the lower heater may be connected 
to the top of the boiler and the upper heater to the side of the 
boiler. 
Boilers “installed horizontally—When range boilers are 
installed in a horizontal 
position, they are usu- 
ally supported by iron 
bands from the floor 
above. <A stock verti-

Without using a tube, 
connect the cold-water supply with the lower opening in the 
other end of the boiler. The hot water should pass out 
through the upper opening at the end, through a curved tube 
so arranged within the boiler as to draw the water from as near 
the top as possible. 
The boiler may be installed with the side openings up   
  
   
-P-A-G-E-434
  414 A FARM WATER SYSTEM 
(Fig. 458). Connect this opening with the hot-water pipe 
leading to the faucets. The cold-water supply should be con- 
nected with the end opening at the center, using a pipe curved 
downward, as shown in Fig. 458. The end having two openings 
is connected with the water front, the upper opening with the 
upper opening of the water front and the lower opening with the 
lower opening of the water front. 
Excess pressure.—When the source of supply is an over- 
head tanks any excess pressure is relieved by forcing water 
out of the boiler through the intake pipe from the overhead

tank. If, however, the hand cut-off valve is closed the water 
could no longer back up into the overhead tank. To guard 
against this a special expansion pipe can be installed: This 
consists merely of a pipe from the hot-water lines which enters 
the storage tank above the highest water level. 
Steam passing from an open hot-water faucet is sometimes 
taken as an indication of excess pressure, while in reality it may 
be only an indication of overheated water with the pressure 
not above normal, although excessive pressure may also exist. 
There is a definite relation between the temperature at which 
water will boil and the pressure the water is under. At atmos-
-P-A-G-E-435
  GENERAL INFORMATION ON FARM WATER SYSTEMS A15 
pheric pressure (14.7 pounds), water will boil at 212° F., 
while if the pressure be increased to 50 pounds, the water will 
get hotter and hotter but will not boil until a temperature of 
297° is reached. Under ordinary conditions the water in a 
range boiler seldom reaches 212° F., but under unusual condi- 
tions, such as a very hot fire for a considerable length of time, 
it may go higher, depending upon the pressure. If this over- 
heated water is released at the faucet to atmospheric pressure, 
part of the water will turn to steam and this condition will 
continue until the temperature in the boiler has been reduced 
by incoming cold water to 212° F., the boiling point of water 
under atmospheric pressure. 
Independent hot-water heaters—When a_ considerable 
quantity of ever-ready hot water is desired, an independent 
hot-water heater, burning either kerosene or coal, is usually 
ideal. A coal heater may be so arranged that, by means of an 
automatic draft regulator suitably connected with the water 
front, a fairly constant temperature of water may be obtained. 
The heater need be only just large enough to hold fire well, 
with about a 12-inch grate, while within reasonable limits, the 
larger the tank the better. 
WATER PUMPS 
A pump is a mechanical device for lifting or lifting and 
forcing water to a desired elevation or pressure. Those pumps 
whose purpose is confined to lifting only are known as lift 
pumps, while those which lift and then force the water are 
known as force pumps. There is a large variety of pumps in 
use, including the well sweep and bucket, the chain pump, the 
ordinary deep-well and shallow-well pumps, and the centrif- 
ugal pump. For the water systems described in this book, 
only the ordinary deep- and shallow-well pumps are of interest. 
Previous to the selection, installation, or repair of any pump, 
it is well to understand the general principles underlying its 
operation.  
-P-A-G-E-436
  416 A FARM WATER SYSTEM

means of a cup leather. The suction pipe, f, is closed by the 
check valve, d. At starting, water stands in the suction pipe * 
at the same level as does the water in the well. The cump
-P-A-G-E-437
  GENERAL INFORMATION ON FARM WATER SYSTEMS 417 
cylinder and the suction pipe above the level of the water in 
the well are filled with air. The air pressure on the water in 
the suction pipe and in the well is equal. Assuming that the 
plunger is at the lower end of the cylinder (Fig. 459, A) valves c 
and d will be closed because of their weight. If the plunger is 
moved up (Fig. 459, B), the volume of the cylinder below the 
plunger increases. As no air can pass downward through valve 
c, the air in the space below the plunger, b, will expand so as to 
occupy the increasing space left as the plunger is raised, and the 
air in the supply pipe, e, being at a greater pressure, will open 
valve d and pass into the space below the elevated plunger. 
As the original quantity of air below the plunger, b, thus like- 
wise expands to fill the increasing cylinder volume, it becomes 
less dense and must therefore exert less pressure on water in 
the suction pipe. Since the air pressure on the surface of the 
water in the well remains constant while the pressure on the 
water in the suction pipe decreases, the water will thus be 
forced up in the suction pipe (Fig. 459, B). The water will rise 
until the decreased air pressure within the pump cylinder plus 
the weight of the rising water in the suction pipe is equal to the 
atmospheric pressure on the water in the well. 
As the plunger descends (Fig. 459, C), valve d at once closes 
and some of the air in the pump cylinder passes out through 
valve c. At the next stroke of the pump the operation just 
* described will be repeated. The water rises higher and higher 
during the first few upstrokes, until the suction pipe and the 
pump cylinder below the plunger are filled with water (Fig. 
459, D). 
As the plunger now descends (Fig. 459, Z), valve d closes and 
valve c opens, and the plunger passes down through the water. 
Upon the next upstroke (Fig. 459, F) valve c closes, the plunger 
lifts the water, now above it, to the level of the spout, whence 
it flows, while at the same time, by the same upstroke, more 
water is drawn in through valve d. 
The pump operates as described because of the air pressure 
on the surface of the water in the well. This air pressure is
-P-A-G-E-438
  
418 A FARM WATER SYSTEM 
due to the weight of the blanket of air about the earth. It is 
known that at sea level a column of air 1 inch square, and extend- 
ing up to the upper air limit, weighs 14.7 pounds. It is said, 
therefore, that air exerts a pressure of 14.7 pounds to the 
square inch. As the weight of 1 cubic foot of water is 62.5 
pounds, the weight of 1 cubic inch is .036 pound. Thus 27.72 
cubic inches of water, placed one on top of the other, would 
weigh almost exactly 1 pound. A column of 27.72 cubic inches 
of water would be the same as a column of water 2.31 feet high. 
It is therefore stated that a column of water 2.31 feet high exerts 
a pressure (weight) of 1 pound on every square inch of its base, 
or, conversely, that it takes a pressure of 1 pound on each 
square inch to lift or maintain a column of water 2.31 feet high. 
We have seen that when the air pressures on the water in 
the suction pipe and in the well are the same, the water stands 
at the same level in each. If, therefore, as has just been 
described, the air pressure on the water in the suction pipe is 
decreased, the water will be forced up into the pipe by the 
outside air pressure until the pressure within the pipe, plus the 
weight of the column of water there, equals the outside air - 
pressure on the water in the well. The two pressures will 
always be equal. 
If the pump were so perfectly constructed that all of the air 
above the water in the suction pipe could be removed, then the 
water would be forced up the suction pipe until the pressure * 
due to the weight of the water alone equaled the outside air 
pressure on the water in the well. In that case, since a column 
of water 2.31 feet high produces a pressure of 1 pound for 
each square inch, a column of water to balance the 14.7 pounds 
a square inch of atmospheric pressure would have to be 34 feet 
high. 
Suction limits.—If a cylinder were located, let us say, at a 
point 40 feet above the water level in a well, the pump plunger 
could do no more than to remove all of the air from the suction 
pipe. If this were done, water would be forced up the pipe to 
such a height that the weight of the column would balance the
-P-A-G-E-439
  GENERAL INFORMATION ON FARM WATER SYSTEMS 419 
air pressure on the water in the well, but above this point the 
water would not rise. Theoretically, for a perfect pump, the 
ultimate height of the lift would be 34 feet; but in practice, 
since no pump is perfect, the practical suction lift is from 20 to 
25 feet. It may therefore be laid down as a rule that the cyl- 
inder of a pump must always be located within from 20 to 25 
feet of the surface of the water in the well. 
Shallow- and deep-well pumps.—A shallow well is one in 
which the water stands at such a level that it may be withdrawn 
by a lift pump located at or near the ground level and at a 
distance from the well. A shallow-well pump is one adapted 
to this service and usually so designed that it cannot be used in 
a deep well, which is one in which the water level is below the 
limit of suction lift. A deep-well pump is one so constructed 
that the depth at which the cylinder is located may be readily 
varied to suit conditions, either so low as to be submerged or 
located down in the well at a point in the pipe within suction 
distance of the water. Shallow-well or deep-well pumps may 
be either force or lift pumps, depending upon their construc- 
tion. 
There are but two general types of pumps, the lift pump 
and the force pump. If it is not desired to deliver water 
higher than the spout of the pump, regardless of whether the 
pump is to be located at the well or at the kitchen sink, then a 
lift pump may be used; but wherever the water must be 
delivered higher than the spout a force pump is necessary. 
The lift pump.—The operation of the cylinder of a lift pump 
is the same as described on pages 417-418. The pump con- 
struction peculiar to a lift pump (Fig. 460, A, B) is that there is 
no packing around the plunger rod, and because of this water 
cannot be delivered above the head of the pump. As the name 
implies, this type of pump will draw and lift water to the eleva- 
tion of the spout and no higher. 
The force pump.—sSingle-action force pump—The single- 
plunger type, with a valve (Fig. 460, C), will deliver water on 
the upstroke only. By comparing Fig. 460 B and C, the dif-

ference between single-acting valve-in-the-plunger types of 
force pump and of lift pump is evident. The operation is the 
same in both cases. With a force pump, however, water can 
be forced through pipes to an elevation higher than the spout.

This is made possible by a stuffing box and by packing around 
the plunger rod, which prevents the escape of water at that 
point. The addition of an air chamber to the pump (Fig. 460 C) 
should be noted. If a hose is connected at the spout, the water, 
not being able to escape past the plunger rod is forced with pres-

sure through the hose. Water can thus be forced to a great 
height, depending only upon the power available at the 
pump. 
Force pumps working on both strokes—Force pumps which 
discharge water on both strokes are of two kinds, differential 
and double action.

pump (Fig. 461, A) has two cylinders, one the working cylinder 
and: the other the differential cylinder. The working cylinder 
is larger and contains a plunger with a valve, while the plunger 
in the differential cylinder is solid. The operation of the work- 
ing cylinder is the same as that of the single-acting lift pump 
(Fig. 460, B), the water being delivered on the upstroke only. 
As the plunger ‘of the main cylinder rises (Fig. 461, A), the solid 
plunger of the differential cylinder also rises. Of the water 
delivered from the main cylinder on the upstroke, some passes 
out the discharge pipe, some fills the differential cylinder, and 
 
-P-A-G-E-442
  
422 A FARM WATER SYSTEM 
some enters the air chamber. On the downstroke the retain- 
ing, or check, valve closes; the plunger in the main cylinder, 
having a valve, merely allows the water to pass up through it; 
while the solid plunger of the differential cylinder forces the 
water from the differential cylinder out through the discharge 
pipe and also into the air chamber. At the end of each stroke, 
while neither plunger is functioning, the air in the air chamber, 
which has been compressed by the water thus forced in, expands, 
forcing some of the water out through the discharge pipe. 
This type of pump, delivering water on both the upstroke and 
the downstroke, thus gives a fairly uniform flow of water. 
The horizontal double-action pump. The horizontal double- 
action pump (Fig. 461, B), has but one solid plunger and delivers 
water on both the instroke and the outstroke. As the plunger 
is drawn to the right, a partial vacuum is formed in e, and 
because of the atmospheric pressure on the water in the well, 
water is forced or drawn in through the suction pipe and 
through valve a into chamber e of the cylinder. On the next 
stroke, toward the left, water is drawn, through the suction 
pipe and valve c, into chamber f of the cylinder. While water 
is being drawn into f through valve c, the water drawn into e 
on the previous stroke is now being forced out. The rising 
pressure in e holds valve a shut and forces valve b open, the 
water thus passing out through the discharge pipe and into the 
air dome (not shown). On the next stroke toward the right, 
valve b closes; water is again drawn through valve a into part e 
of the cylinder, while the water in f is forced out through valve 
d into the air dome and out through the discharge pipe. Such 
a pump, delivering water on both strokes, furnishes a steady 
supply from the discharge pipe. There is a packed stuffing 
box around the plunger rod to prevent the leakage of water 
past it. 
The air dome—It will be noted that force pumps are 
equipped with some type of air dome (Figs. 460, C), the pur- 
pose of which is twofold: namely, to prevent undue strain 
on the pump or engine, and to keep up a steady flow of water
-P-A-G-E-443
  GENERAL INFORMATION ON FARM WATER SYSTEMS 423 
through the discharge pipe. When the discharge pipe from a 
force pump is full, the water can escape from the pump cylinder 
only at a limited rate. During the work-stroke, water is forced 
into the discharge pipe faster than it can escape. Water not 
being compressible, a considerable strain would thus be thrown 
on the engine or pump. Air, however, is compressible, and if 
it is present in an air dome, the excess water delivered from the 
cylinder of the pump during the work-stroke, instead of crowd- 
ing out the discharge pipe, passes into the air dome, com- 
pressing the air there and thus relieving the pump or engine 
from the extreme pressures that would otherwise result. 
The air dome may be separate from, or integral with, 
the spout (Fig. 460, C). If integral with the spout, the 
stuffing box with packing which surrounds the plunger rod 
is located in the top of the air dome. When winding the 
packing, usually candle wicking, around the pump rod, it is 
well to remember that it should be wound in the same direction 
as that in which the brass gland screws. In this way, drawing 
the brass gland into place tightens the packing instead of 
unwinding it. The purpose of the beveled edges on a stuffing 
box and on the brass gland is to force the packing in against 
the pump rod. 
The calculation of pump capacity.—The quantity of water 
that any pump can deliver in a minute will vary with the area 
of the pump cylinder, the distance through which the plunger 
travels on the work-stroke, and the number of work-strokes a 
minute. 
The use of Table 12 will simplify the determination of pump 
capacities and also the selection of the pump necessary to 
deliver the required quantity of water.

  CHAPTER X 
SEWAGE DISPOSAL 
THE SEPTIC TANK AND ITS RELATION TO THE WATER SYSTEM 
SEWAGE DISPOSAL 
Methods of disposing of bathroom wastes: 
With the installation of a system supplying running water 
in the bathroom and kitchen, there arises the necessity of dis- 
posing of the water and the wastes. For this purpose either a 
cesspool or a septic tank, depending on conditions, should be 
constructed. 
The cesspool.—The cesspool is somewhat cheaper and easier 
to make than a septic tank. It may be safely used where the 
soil is sufficiently loose and open to insure adequate drainage 
out through the loose stone walls, and where the relative loca- 
tions of the cesspool and the source of water supply are such that 
there is no possible danger of flow from the cesspool to the 
drinking water. This cesspool seepage may travel for very 
considerable distances through loose gravel, cracks in shale 
rock, or openings in limestone formations, and therefore a 
drilled well cased down to the surface of limestone or shale rock 
is not necessarily safe. A cesspool dug in soil not sufficiently 
open will eventually clog and overflow, often necessitating the 
construction of a new cesspool. 
The septic tank.—The septic tank is a chamber, simple in 
construction and not large, generally made of concrete, water- 
tight, and so arranged as to bring about, as completely as pos- 
sible, the decomposition of the solids in bathroom and kitchen 
426
-P-A-G-E-447
  SEPTIC TANK AND ITS RELATION TO WATER SYSTEM 427 
wastes. A septic tank must be supplied with a suitable dis- 
posal system of drain tile to take care of the flow of waste 
water from the tank. This disposal system is described later. 
While the action of the septic tank will turn to liquid part of 
the solids entering, it should not be expected that there will be 
no accumulation in the septic tank. In fact the tank should 
be properly cleaned at least once in every five-year period. 
As shown in Fig. 462, this type of tank is, on the inside, 4 feet 
6 inches deep, and 3 or 4 feet wide, and from 6 to 8 feet long.

      Fig. 462.—Construction of Type Y Septic Tank. Inlet and outlet pipes 
are 4-inch vitrified sewer pipe Y branches.   It is made of concrete poured around a single form as simple as 
that used for making any other single-chamber tank. Each 
side of this form carries two vertical beveled strips of wood 
which leave grooves on the inside walls of the finished tank, 
and in these grooves short lengths of plank are placed to form 
partial divisions in the tank. The purpose of these is to cause 
the solids to settle, to aid the bacterial action and to prevent 
the solids from escaping through the outlet. The inlet and 
outlet passages are through 4-inch, vitrified, Y-branch, sewer- 
pipe fittings, easily obtainable and very simply installed in the 
 
-P-A-G-E-448
    
428 SEWAGE DISPOSAL 
tank. The upper branch of the intake Y is plugged so that the 
sewage must enter the tank through the lower opening. In 
case the sewer pipe between the house and the septic tank 
becomes clogged, this plug can be removed and a cleaner 
forced through the pipe to the running trap. If an elbow- 
fitting were used instead of the Y, this cleaning operation would 
not be possible. The 4-inch vitrified Y used for the outlet is 
placed 14 inches lower than the inlet Y. With the exception 
of a small hole for a vent, the upper part of the outlet Y is 
closed and the liquid from the tank is made to pass out through 
the branch opening. 
Connections with the house drain.—Four-inch bell-and- 
spigot vitrified tile are laid from the house to the tank (Fig. 426), 
and the joints cemented (Fig. 468). A grade of } inch to the 
foot is permissible, } inch to the foot is desirable, while more 
than 2 inch to the foot is not recommended, since too steep a 
grade will produce excessive agitation of the contents of the 
tank. 
Connection with the disposal tile-—Overflow from the out- 
let pipe of septic tanks is best distributed evenly through a large 
area of surface soil by allowing the liquid to soak away from 
numerous joints between the lengths of one or more runs of 
distributing drain tile laid underground not far below the 
surface. Disease bacteria, if any are present in the bathroom 
wastes, will be in part destroyed during the rotting process in 
the septic tank; but many are sure to flow from the tank into 
the distributing tile. From the tile the bacteria are carried, 
by very slight movements of the water, out among the adjacent 
soil particles, to which they will at once adhere; and since the 
conditions in the soil are very different from those in which 
the disease bacteria thrive, they will soon die and the danger 
from them will be removed. The action of the air and the 
bacteria always existing in surface soils will, if the distributing 
tile are properly installed, keep the soil open and fresh, by the 
processes of nature, for an indefinite period.

Tools and Equipment.—Lumber and tools for making forms. 
Tools and materials for making concrete, sewer pipe, drain tile 
and reinforcement. 
1. Locate the septic tank and the absorption area.—Neither 
the septic tank nor the disposal area can be exactly located until 
a number of factors have been carefully considered. Certain 
definite requirements must be met, and as the topography, 
type of soil, and the size of the area available for each installa- 
tion vary, the location of the tank and of the disposal area 
must vary to meet existing conditions and the requirements 
necessary for successful operation. 
Factors to consider —(1) Contamination. There is not much 
danger from seepage from either the septic tank of the disposal 
tile, if the tank is carefully and well built and the absorption area 
is properly located. Locate the absorption area where neither 
the slope of the ground nor the direction of seepage is toward 
the source of water supply. No contamination should result if, 
in fairly heavy soils, the tile area is 75 feet away from the 
water supply. For lighter soils lay the tile at a distance of 
150 to 300 feet from the water supply. 
(2) The inlet sewer—a. Depth.—The inlet sewer should be 
about 2 feet below the surface at the most shallow point. Sew- 
age will not freeze in the sewer pipe at this depth, if carefully 
laid to grade so that there are no sags in which the sewage can 
collect. 
b. Grade.—The inlet sewer should have a grade of not less 
than § inch to the foot. A flatter grade will decrease the velocity
-P-A-G-E-450
430 SEWAGE DISPOSAL 
of the sewage and thus tend to settle out the solids which, in 
turn, may fill the sewer pipe; a grade as steep as ? inch to the 
foot is also undesirable. If a steep grade is unavoidable, place 
the septic tank near the house if possible, and let the steep 
slope follow, rather than precede, the tank. 
(3) The septic tank—a. Depth.—The septic tank should be 
protected by a covering of earth sufficiently deep to maintain 
vegetation. A depth of about 12 inches is usually satisfactory. 
In level ground, this will place the outlet sewer pipe about 27 
inches below the surface of the ground. 
b. Distance from house.—The septic tank may be placed 
quite near the house or at some distance from it, depending on 
the area available for the disposal plant and on the topography 
of the plot. It is possible, however, to place it too near the 
house, for if the sewage enters with a rush, the contents will be 
stirred up, and this agitation will retard the septic action. It is 
better, therefore, to have 25 to 50 feet of sewer pipe between the 
house and the septic tank. 
(4) Absorption area—a. Depth of tile. —It is desirable to have 
the tile in the absorption area within 12 to 18 inches of the sur- 
face; therefore, the absorption area should, if possible, be at a 
level at least 1 foot below the proposed location of the septic 
tank. If the ground is fairly level, this may require locating 
the absorption area at some distance from the septic tank, or 
placing the tile at a greater depth and in greater number to 
compensate for this greater depth. 
b. Amount of tile-—The tile can be located either near the 
septic tank or at a considerable distance from it. In a soil con- 
taining much sand or gravel, 10 to 20 feet of absorption tile per 
person will be required, while in a loam, 30 to 50 feet is necessary. 
If there are not more than five or six people in the household, 
and if a sandy or gravelly soil is available for the absorption 
tile, a single line of tile may be used. Only in exceptional cases 
should a line of tile be more than 100 feet long. Such an excep- 
tion occurs where it is necessary to put the absorption tile in a 
hillside. If the absorption area has a fairly level surface and 
 
-P-A-G-E-451
SEPTIC TANK AND ITS RELATION TO WATER SYSTEM 431 
the soil is less porous, two or more lines of tile may be needed; 
the lines should all be approximately the same length, and, as 
previously stated, this length should not be more than 100 feet. 
Where more than one row of tile is needed, the rows should 
preferably be at least 6 feet apart, and better results would be 
obtained by leaving a space of 10 feet between them; but if 
only a limited area is available, it would be better to reduce the 
spacing to 5 feet rather than to limit the total length of tile used. 
If more than one line of tile is installed, some device must be 
constructed and installed which will distribute the waste from 
the tank evenly among the several lines of tile (Fig. 469). Forms 
for building the Cornell Sewage divider may be obtained at cost 
from the Department of Rural Engineering, at Ithaca, New 
York. Absorption tile may be placed in a hillside if they are 
laid in rows nearly parallel with the contours. 
c. Grade in tile-——The absorption tile, in porous soils, 
should have a grade of 7; to 4 inch to the foot, and in less 
porous soils, 3 to 7s inch to the foot. 
(5) Shade, wetness, etc.—The area should not be shaded, nor 
should the tile be laid near willows or poplars, as the roots of 
these trees may soon fill the tile. 
(6) Excavation.—The system should be located so that the 
minimum amount of excavating will have to be done. 
Bearing these factors in mind, locate the tank and absorp- 
tion area for a certain specific set of conditions. Assume this 
set of conditions or obtain the necessary data by a field trip. 
2. Build the forms.—The tank should be large enough to 
hold one day’s flow of sewage, in addition to an accumulation 
of sludge and scum, and have an extra depth of from 10 to 12 
inches in the upper part of the tank; hence the size will depend 
largely on the number of people in the household. The sizes 
given in the table, Fig. 462, are based on the normal water 
consumption of a country residence having running water in 
the house. 
Where a septic tank is to be constructed in firm earth, only 
the inside form will be needed. Make this form (Fig. 463) of 
 
-P-A-G-E-452

of 24-inch material cut about 8 feet long for average condi- 
tions. ; 
Cut two 24-inch center braces each 4 feet 6 inches long. 
In addition the following material will be needed: 
1 piece, 14 inchesX2} inchesX10 feet 8 inches, to make 
4 beveled cleats. 
Bracing, 7 inchX4 inches or 5 inchesX12 feet, for top,

Cut the boards for the ends of the form about 2 inches 
narrower than the inside width of the tank and nail them 
securely to the edge of the corner posts for a distance of about 
30 inches up from the bottom. The ends of the end boards 
should be even with the faces of the side of the 24 corner 
posts. Attach the remaining end boards with light nails, just 
long enough to hold them in position, as it will be necessary 
later to separate the posts from these boards in removing the 
   
-P-A-G-E-453
SEPTIC TANK AND ITS RELATION TO WATER SYSTEM 433 
form. At this time, cut the holes for the inlet and outlet 
fittings. Bevel the ends of the boards used for the sides, as 
shown in detail in Fig. 463, so as to facilitate their removal from 
the concrete. Nail the side boards securely to the 24 upright 
to which the center bracing is to be fastened. In order to form 
slots in the concrete in which to place the baffles, prepare and 
nail beveled cleats in their proper places, as shown in Fig. 463, 
care being taken to place the two 28-inch pieces at the inlet 
end of each side form. 
Assemble the form as a whole, being sure that the surface 
of the end boards is at least a inch beyond the ends of the side 
boards, as shown in Fig. 463. 
Do not nail through the side boards into the corner posts, but, 
instead, nail from the inside through the corner posts into the 
side boards; and do not drive the nails completely, but leave 
the heads far enough out to permit the nails to be readily with- 
drawn for the removal of the form. This will facilitate the 
removal of the forms. Paint the side of the forms next to the 
concrete with a mixture of equal parts of raw linseed oil and 
kerosene or old cylinder oil. Brace the center horizontally 
and diagonally, as shown in Fig. 463. The cross arms can 
be attached only after the rise indicated in Fig. 467 has been 
determined, and to find this it is first necessary to determine 
the inlet drop by leveling, as shown in Fig. 465. Make the 
forms for the cover slabs at the same time the forms are 
made for the tank. For a tank 3 feet wide and 6 feet long, 
each cover slab will be 21 inches wide, 4 feet long and 3} inches 
thick. 
Preparing the Y-branches.—At least one day before the 
actual building of the tank, construct the plugs for the 
Y-branches for the inlet and outlet, as indicated in Fig. 462. 
Place the tile on end with the bell ends up. For the inlet 
fitting, place a tin disk in the bottom of the bell, rub the sides 
of the bell with a little grease or oil, and fill with mortar made 
of one part of cement and three parts of sand. Imbed in the 
fresh mortar some means of pulling out the plug. For the
-P-A-G-E-454
434 SEWAGE DISPOSAL 
outlet fitting, cut the tin with a projecting side which is bent 
up to leave a vent on the side of the bell above, or away from, 
the side branch. 
3. Stake out the tank location and excavate for it— 
Having decided upon the location of the septic tank and 
having made the forms, the next step is to mark out on the 
ground the outside limits of the tank. If outside forms are 
unnecessary, make the excavation 1 foot longer and 13 inches

when the pit is dug. 
Next, drive four solid stakes P (2X4’s, will answer) at a 
distance B from the center line (1-1) and 114 inches, respect- 
ively, from lines 44 and 5-5. The tops of the stakes must all 
be at the same level (see page 212); the exact height, however, 
is not important. It is important that all stakes be completely  
-P-A-G-E-456
436 SEWAGE DISPOSAL 
driven before any excavation is begun, as otherwise the sides of 
the pit may be thus caused to cave in. Dig that part of the 
sewer trench next the inlet end of the septic tank. The bottom 
of the trench at this place was established when the location of 
the tank was decided. (Requirements 1, 2, 3, page 429.) 
The inlet drop and the rise depend entirely upon the height 
of the stakes, P, as shown in Figs. 465 and 467. The inlet drop 
(Fig. 465), is the vertical distance from the bottom of the inlet 
ditch to the level of the tops of stakes, P. Measure this dis- 
tance with a carpenter’s level and a straight edge, as indicated 
in the drawing (Fig. 465). The rise is the vertical distance from 
the top of the form to the bottom of the horizontal cross arms. 
Locate the bottom of the outlet ditch 14 inches lower than the 
bottom of the inlet ditch. In locating it, use a carpenter’s 
level and straight edge, measuring down from the top of the 
nearest stakes, P, 13 inches more than for the inlet drop. 
Dig the hole. Nail the long cross pieces to the corner 
braces at such a point that the distance from the bottom of the 
inlet opening to the bottom of the cross piece equals the inlet 
drop. 
In order to determine the depth to which the pit for the 
septic tank should be dug, cut a stick equal in length to the 
distance from the under side of the cross arms on the form to 
the bottom of the form. To allow for the thickness of the 
concrete at the bottom of the septic tank, add 5 inches more to 
this length, by nailing a second stick to the first. 
This makes a gauge which, if held under horizontal scant- 
ling resting on the stakes (Fig. 466) will indicate the depth to 
which the pit should be dug. Drive several small stakes in 
the bottom of the hole. Have the tops of these stakes at such 
a height that the gauge stick will just touch them. Remove 
these after the concrete has been placed in the hole level with 
the tops of these stakes. 
After the excavation has been completed remove the 5-inch 
extension and use the original stick to determine the level of 
the surface of the concrete in the botton of the tank.

SEPTIC TANK AND ITS RELATION TO WATER SYSTEM 437 
4, Build the tank.—1. Place the concrete——Make the con- 
erete for the tank of good Portland cement, clean sand and 
broken stone or clean gravel, mixed in proportions of one part, 
by measure, of cement, two parts of sand, and four parts of 
gravel or broken stone; this is known as 1: 2:4 mixture. 
The quantities of cement, sand, and gravel will depend 
  Fic. 466.—Gauge for Digging Pit and Laying Concrete. 
upon the size of the tank and can be figured by referring to 
Table 6, page 340. 
If a power mixer is not available, the sand, cement and 
gravel should be mixed thoroughly as described in Chapter VIII, 
page 341. 
Put the bottom in first, tamp it thoroughly, and trowel it
-P-A-G-E-458

to a smooth surface. Place the form in the pit with the long 
cross arms resting on the stakes P. If the work has been

correctly done, the lower edge of the form will just rest on the 
concrete bottom,
-P-A-G-E-459
  
SEPTIC TANK AND ITS RELATION TO WATER SYSTEM 439 
Place the concrete for the walls the same day as the bottom, 
in order to secure a good bond. Place the concrete in the 
forms 6 to 10 inches deep, and tamp each layer thoroughly. 
Spade the concrete next to the forms so as to get a dense surface. 
When the walls have been filled almost to the height of the inlet 
and outlet pipes, put these pipes, plugged as previously de- 
scribed, in place, and continue placing the concrete until the 
walls are completed. Pack the concrete well under and 
around these Y-branches. Do not allow them to project so far 
into the tank as to prevent the insertion of the baffle boards. 
2. Make the cover—Fill the forms for the cover slabs and 
cure the concrete well before they are put in place. Reinforce 
the slabs with a good grade of metal lath, placing it } inch from 
the underside of the slab. Bend it up at the ends as shown in 
Fig. 462, Sec. B-B. 
3. Remove the forms.—Remove the form, after the concrete 
in the bottom and walls of the septic tank has hardened suffi- 
ciently. First remove the center brace, then draw the nails 
that hold the 24-inch corner pieces to the sides, and then 
remove the ends of the form. After this, remove the sides with 
their cleats, leaving the slots for the baffle boards. Make the 
baffle boards of 2-inch plank, preferably of cypress or chestnut, 
and put them in place before the cover slabs are put on the tank. 
Cut the baffles to the correct length. If, however, they have 
been cut a fraction of an inch too short, they can be held in 
place by a wedge at one end of the upper plank. 
5. Lay the sewer pipe-—Upon completing the septic tank, 
dig the remaining part of the ditch from the tank to the house. 
Unless there is a deep cut, dig the ditch to grade through its 
entire length before laying any sewer tile. For directions for 
laying out the ditch, see Chapter VI. If possible, make the 
ditch straight and have the bottom on a uniform grade. If 
there is a bend greater than 5 inches in 2 feet, use curved 
pipe. Four-inch vitrified clay sewer pipe is generally used. 
One end of each length is enlarged to form a socket called a 
bell (Fig. 468); the end that is not enlarged is called the spigot  
-P-A-G-E-460
  440 SEWAGE DISPOSAL 
end. This kind of pipe is often spoken of as bell and spigot 
pipe. 
Cutting vitrified sewer pipe.—Use a sharp cold chisel and a 
hammer. Fill the pipe with sand and then make a shallow 
cut in the glazing entirely around the pipe. Cut around again, 
going a little deeper; continue cutting around, tapping the 
chisel lightly, until the pipe breaks off at the mark. 
Lay the pipe.—Pack well any newly filled ground or subse- 
quent settling may spoil the grade or even break the pipe. 
Begin at the septic tank and work toward the house, always 
laying the pipes with the bell end upgrade. Lay the spigot 
end of the first sewer pipe against the spigot end of the inlet 
Y-branch and make a 
water-tight joint with 
cement mortar. Now 
Fia. 468.—Sewer Pipe Properly Laid. place some oakum and 
cement mortar in the 
bottom of the bell of the first sewer pipe and lay the spigot end 
of the second on this oakum and mortar, using enough to bring 
the inside of both sewer pipes to the same level; then place 
the other end of the second in proper position for alignment 
and grade; next fill up the back part of the joint with oakum 
(this prevents the mortar from entering the sewer); fill the 
remaining part of the joint with cement mortar (Fig. 468). 
Continue laying the sewer pipe in this manner until the line 
has been laid from the septic tank to the running trap at the 
house. Sewer pipe with cemented joints should also be used 
in the trench connecting the septic tank and the absorption 
area. 
Put just enough soil around the sewer pipe while laying it 
to hold it in place until the mortar kas set. 
Backfill.—Later fill the trench. Do not allow large stones 
to drop on the sewer pipe, for there is danger of breaking it. 
6. Lay the absorption tile—Common, hard-burned agri- 
cultural drain tile, having an inside diameter of 3 or 4 inches, 
are usually used with single-chamber septic tanks.

Where a heavy loam is encountered, it is advisable to dig a 
wider ditch and to place cinders, gravel or broken stone along- 
side of the tile to assist in distribution.

REPORT. 
Tt is again my duty to render an account of the high trust con- 
fided to me two years ago, by making a detailed report of my 
official proceedings during the last scholastic year, exhibiting a 
statistical account of receipts and éxpenditures for Public Schools, 
and of their general condition and progress. The ieintenanee of 
a well devised and uniform system of Publig Bah Bohows th its eco- 
nomic effects on society at large, has been 0% ei prentts hte! Hp the 
people and discussed by legislative bodies a further refogasies, to 
it would be obtrusive. I beg, however,” to ythat we have Great 
reason for congratulation: for in the general 7) ‘prosperity of’ ‘the 
. State, in the continued development of “her nesouteeg,,the progipss 
of her commerce, the successful efforts, of fy her authorities t ehebur- 
age immigration, her schools and school interests have eps, ‘pari

The reports of County and City Superintendedih \aleynopsis of 
which is herewith submitted, shows a marked improvement on the 
work of last year, and indicate most conclusively that Tennessee is 
keeping pace with others in the general sisterhood of States, both 
as to a steady increase of interest in the cause of popular education 
and improvement in school management, and in methods of instruc- 
tion. 
AMENDMENTS TO THE SCHOOL LAW. 
I shall, in this report, recommend only a few changes in the 
school law. The law as it now is, in the main, is a good one. It 
_is plain in its leading provisions, and the people have become some- 
what familiar with its general application. Radical changes would 
therefore create confusion. Still, there are several matters of detail 
concerning which the law might be much improved. But the im- 
portance of most of these modifications of the law may. be brought 
to the attention of the Committees on Education and Common 
Schools of the two Houses of the General Assembly, without en- 
cumbering this report with recommendations concerning them.

T desire to renew’ the reference made in my annual report of last 
"year to the saving by public schools. The great economy involved 
in our system of public instruction. is shown to a better advantage 
in the report of the year just closed’ than in any previous year. 
By reference to our statistical tables it.is seen that the average cost 
of tuition per papil per month in our private schools is $1.70, while 
that of the public schools is 59 cents, thus making a difference of 
$1.11 per pupil per month in favor of public schools. Taking into 
account the number of pupils enrolled in the public schools. last
-P-A-G-E-10
(10) . ry a 
year (350,143), the amount saved is $388,658.73 per month, or, 
$1,943,293.65 for a term of five months. Our figures show the 
actual cost of tuition in the public schools, while every one whoris. 
familiar with the cost of tuition in private schools must admit that 
the above average of $1.70 per pupil per month is a fair if nota 
low estimate. It should be borne in mind that our reports from 
private schools are obtained by means of blank forms furnished by 
~ this department to county superintendents, whose duty it is to make: 
inquiry of the teachers of private schools in their respective coun- 
ties, and fill these blanks according to the teachers’ reports, and re- 
turn the same.with their annual reports to the State Superinten- 
dent. 
- NORMAL INSTITUTES. | 
The habit on the part of our teachers of clinging to old methods, 
imply‘because they are old, is gradually giving way to the better 
sekles more i : - babilts< ! & ane improved methods of the present day, in hold 
ang on to 's good in the old, and adopting what is good in the 
new. Unfertinately, however, an impression prevails, to a consid- 
erable exten among our public school authorities, that any educated 
person Ys qualified ‘to'teach school. It might as well be claimed 
thafany person whe understands mathematics and astronomy is there- 
fore qualified to nayigate a ship. A person may be well educated 
os in the common aceeptation of that term, and yet be a failure as a 
teachey, ¢ He-may never have given a thought to the science and 
delicate work of teaching; the many excellent works on methods 
of instruction, prepared by able writers on education, may be to him 
mere myths; he may have failed asa lawyer or physician, and yet, 
because he has a diploma from seme high school or college, he is 
employed to teach “the district school.” It is generally admitted 
that.after a man has acquired an education, such as is provided for 
in our colleges, he must‘study the science and the art of a profession 
before he can hope to attain success in it. Teaching, which is per- 
haps the most delicate and difficult of all professions, should not be ~ 
made an exception to this general rule. After a person has acquired 
a knowledge of the branches to: be taught, he must then study the 
art and science of teaching them. - It is true, there are some “born 
teachers,” but they constitute the exception and not the rule. 
Every one who is at all familiar with the practical workings of our 
q :
-P-A-G-E-11
(11) 
system of education will at once recognize the importance of' pro-. 
fessional training to prepare the teacher for the-work before him. 
Our State Normal College-is doing excellent work in this direction, . 
but its advantages are far too limited to reach the great majority of 
our teachers. Only a few enjoy these advantages. The only pio- 
fessional training given most of our teachers is obtained in Normal ' 
Institutes. Early in the year it was decided to hold as many of. 
these Institutes as possible, with the means at our command for the 
purpose, under the immediate supervision of the State Superinten- 
dent. ‘Accordingly, they were held at ‘the following places, viz.t 
Covingten, one week; Humboldt, one month ; Lewisburg, one ~ 
month ; Mont Eagle, one month, and Knoxville, one month. “These 
were all aided by an appropriation from the Peabody Fund. “Thiee 
Institutes for colored teachers were held in the State fora period 
of about one month each. These were supported by a pare of the 
_Peabody appropriation. . - 
In addition to these Institutes aided by this fund, several county 
Normal Institutes were held, one at Lebanon, Gallatin, and Greene- 
ville, and some others. 
In all these Institutes were employed some of our best teachers 
in graded schools, and ablest professors in academies, colleges and ~ 
universities. It is gratifying to add that much interest was mani- 
fested by the people in whose midst these exercises were had, while 
the teachers attending as pupils. were almost unanimous in their 
praise of the work, and in their acknowledgment of the great ben- 
efit it was to them. ' 
COUNTY INSTITUTES. 
Many county superintendents, appreciating the importance of such. . 
a course, organized County Institutes or educational associations, in 
which their teachers could meet and mingle, and interchange views 
on methods of instruction. In some of these, experts were em- 
-ployed to lecture on the most generally approved methods of im- 
parting instruction. Much good grows out of these county teach- 
ers’ meetings, in that, while the teachers. themselves share great 
benefits, the people who attend become interested, and a healthier . 
public sentiment in favor of free education ‘is created. 
Most of these County Institutes are much embarrassed by a want °
-P-A-G-E-12
4 (12) 
of means to meet necessary expenses, having to rely entirely on 
private contributions. They are, therefore, of short duration. Now, 
realizing that the highest welfare of the State is bound up with its 
schools, and having seen how inadaquate and unsatisfactory many 
of them are on account of inefficient instruction, discipline and gen- © 
eral management, I have deemed it my duty, after much reflection, 
to suggest legislation on this matter, making a small appropriation 
to be drawn on requesition of the State Superintendent, (as other. 
_-expenses of this department are) for the support of Institutes. If 
we could have one good Institute in each Senatorial District of the 
_ State, for the benefit of both white and colored teachers, for a 
period of one month, judiciously and intelligently conducted, 
through which the faculty and graduates of our Normal College, 
and other able and experienced educators could bring their in- 
struction to bear upon the great body of our teachers scattered 
through the various counties, we should see, I apprehend, a_ 
marked improvement of our schools of every grade throughout 
| the State. In this way the influence of the Normal College | 
“and that of the Public Schools would become reciprocal. An - 
organic connection would be established between them. The spirit 
and methods of the professional institution would work dowaward 
and be diffased through the public schools, while sympathy and' pat- 
ronage would come back from the teachers of the State to give sup- 
port and public favor to that institution. - The sum of $5,000 per 
annum, economically used, would meet this expense for both white 
and colored Institutes, for the instructors employed in one could 
give a part of their time to the other, both being held at the same 
time and place. Then, with one grand central Institute at some 
eligible place in the State, or one for each grand division of the 
State, to be held for one month in midsummer, such as we have a 
right to believe the Peabody fund would support, I have no doubt 
all would at once be yegarded with public favor as an important 
adjuvant of our educational system, and as essential to its continued 
elevation and prosperity. Especially would I recommend that the 
County Courts be authorized by law to make appropriations for In- 
stitute purposes in all counties where they are inclined to do so, I 
herewith submit a resolution, adopted by the Board of Trustees of 
the Peabody Education Fund at their late session, as follows: 
“On motion of Goyernor Fish, it was 
‘ 
‘\
-P-A-G-E-13
(18) 
Resolved, That this Board approve the suggestion made-in the 
Report of the General Agent, that the policy applied to schools, of 
helping only those communities which help themselves, be also 
applied to States in reference to Institutes.” 
‘ . PEABODY AID. 
In addition to an appropriation of $9,000 to the State Normal 
College, and $2,800 to the support. of fourteen scholarships in that 
institution, the sum of $1,700. was forwarded by Dr. J. L. M. 
Curry, the General Agent of the Peabody Education Fund, to 
the State Superintendent for educational purposes in Tennessee. - 
Of this sum, the city schools of Jackson, for special reasons, were - 
paid $200; the remainder of $1,500 was used in the support of 
Normal Institutes, elsewhere‘referred to in this report. Thus it is, 
“ geen that exclusive of the appropriation to the Normal College, 
Tennessee is favored with a large share of the benefits of the 
income of this Fund. 
-From the recommendation of the General Agent, in his able 
and comprehensive report, made to the Board of Trust, at their last 
meeting in New York, we are justified in inferring that, except for. . 
special reasons and extraordinary emergencies, aid to schools will be 
withdrawn, and the income of the Fund will be appropriated to the 
promotion of the efficiency of teaching. The General Agent uses 
the following explicit language: 
‘©The States which comprise the field of the operations of the 
Fund gradually increase in their material resources. ‘With ad- 
vancing prosperity come corresponding. ability and inclination to 
foster general education. With increased taxable property school 
revenues increase. The Fund is interested in the development of 
wealth, as the establishment, maintenance, and improvement of 
free schools are affected thereby. With the excellent models which 
are before us to be copied and adapted to local and exceptional con- . 
ditions, we have a right to expect wiser measures and higher ideals. 
The ‘first work of the Fund. was to aid in the establishment ‘of 
public school systems. That being unalterably accomplished, the 
obvious duty now is to look to the character. of the schools, and so 
to direct your helpful appropriations as to co-operate most efficiently 
in making them better. It is gratifying that the public sentiment
-P-A-G-E-14
(14) 
having been won to the favor of free schools, is now logically - 
directed to: their elevation, which is, of course, to be wrought 
through the agency of better teaching.” 
STATE TEACHERS’ ASSOCIATION. 
‘The twentieth annual session of the. State Teachers’ Association 
was held at Paris, October 1884, The attendance and interest 
were good, both on the part of the’teachers and citizens of the 
town. The people of Paris evinced that hospitality for. which : 
they are noted, in their entertainment of the members of the asso- 
ciation and other visitors, and manifested a very high appreciation’ 
of the work of the session. 
The colored teachers held their State Institute in Nashville, and 
report an interesting and profitable session. . 
COUNTY SUPERIN’ TENDENTS. 
To secure efficient County Superintendents over the State, F 
think it would be well to graduate their compensation according to 
the service rendered. This can be done in two ways, either by pay- 
ing them a salary in proportion to the School fund of each county 
and the scholastic population of the same, or by allowing them com- 
pensation for the number of schools visited by them, teachers ex- 
amined, Institutes held, reports made in accordance with law, and. 
other work pertaining to the duties of their office. Either of these 
modes of compensation would greatly encourage them in their work, 
and i increase its efficiency. 
PHYSIOLOGY AND HYGIENE. 
It may be well to remark, that the propriety of adding to 
cur -public school curriculum another. branch of study, that of 
Physiology and Hygiene, is worthy the attention of our Legislature. 
If our State Board: of Health should be empowered to recommend 
some Work on this subject, written with especial reference to the 
influence of alcoholic stimulants and narcotics on the human system, 
and the same should be added to the public school course, good 
results would doubtless follow. It is believed that if boys should be 
impressed with. the scientific conclusion that both alcohol and 
tobacco are deleterious to the human system, and that habitual in-
-P-A-G-E-15
(15 ) 
 dulgence in the use of such will injure and tend to destroy vitality. and 
render them unfit for the great duties of life; they will necessarily avoid 
the use of the same. Let this fact be taught them by a good text 
book, as any other scientific principle is taught, and they will be ~ 
governed in act by the one as they.are by the other, Let them 
know the effect of these stimulants and narcotics‘on the stomach, ~ 
the brain, and the nervous system genenerally ; let this ‘be taught 
them before the habit is formed, and it is believedjthat no other 
agency will more effectively promote the cause of temperance and 
at the same time bring about a healthful physical development on | 
the part of the youth of our State, : 
NEW ORLEANS EXHIBIT. 
The United States Commissioner of Education at Washington has 
invited Tennessee to make an educational exhibit at the World’s 
Industrial and Cotton Centennial Exposition at New Orleans. I 
have therefore appointed Professor Frank Goodman, of Nashville, 
as Commissioner for Tennessee, to take. charge of the work of super- 
vising the exhibit, which he is doing with his usual energy and en- - 
terprise. He will make a report of the same in due time. He 
is very much embarrassed by a want of funds to make such display 
of « our school work as would show the State to advantage. 
THANKS TO THE PRESS. 
The press throughout the State have shown much liberality by 
lending their influence to the great cause of popular education. We | 
ask them to accept our thanks for many courtesies shown us in our 
intercourse with them throughout the State. - 
THANKS TO CITY SUPERINTENDENTS, - 
T acknowledge my thanks to the superintendents of the schools 
of the various cities of the State for their prompt responses to a 
request to furnish reports of their work, all of which show grati- 
fying progress. 
CONCLUSION. 
Idesire to again tender my sincere thanks to my associate, Col. 
Leon Trousdale, for his valuable counsel and active aid in the dis- 
charge of the duties imposed upon this office.
-P-A-G-E-16

To the people of the State, who have everywhere git 
cordial welcome, I renew my thanks for their kind treat: 
words of encouragement in their cooperation with me in 
to promote the continued improvement of our schools. 
To your Excellency, I am indebted for wise and willin; 
and for liberal encouragement in my official endeavors.

REPORT 
OF THE 
“STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION. — 
  An accompaniment or outgrowth of the general interest in 
universal education, is’ the creation ‘of a numerous ‘profession . of 
teachers and the establishment of special schools for their training. 
In all European governments, and in almost all. of the American 
States, normal schools are maintained, at larg ‘SOBH fox Sdacating 
teachers, who are thus_puton a level with the diberal :fipfeesions, 
to whose benefit training schools were formerly limited.”.To ‘the 
United States there were, in 1882, 97 grmal schools, wit ae 
teachers and 17,964 pupils, supported by ¥hintytwo, States. | “Dke 
six States making the largest aenal appro ‘abd Rdg Kork, 
$138,256 ; Virginia, $112,049 (incldgling $100,000 for site, and 
buildings) ; Massachusetts, $85,899 ; Pew ylvania, $79,0545 Gali- . 
fornia, $62,000, and Illinois, $51,264." te all these, States the 
leading cities also in addition expend lake sums upon normal 
schools. _ aoe an 
The Southern States making the largest annual appropriations 
for this purpose, in 1882, were, Texas, $18,000; Alabama, $15,500, ' 
white and colored; Maryland $12,000, white and colored; Ten- 
néssee $12,500, white and colored; Virginia $12,000, white and 
colored. . : — 
All the above-mentioned sums for 1882, it must be noted, were 
~ annual appropriations for the maintenance of normal colleges, with 
the one exception mentioned. : - : 
It has been the singular good fortune of Tennessee to secure, at 
very small cost, one of the most noted normal colleges ‘in the 
Union, “ . ~
-P-A-G-E-56

In 1867, George Peabody, one of the most remarkable business. - 
men in America or Britain, made a foundation, while living, upon - 
which to rebuild the educatidnal systems of the eleven States laid - 
waste by the great civil war of 1861-65, This princely dosiation! 
was two million dollars. ~ , 
After 1897, the trustees have the power to close the trust, and. 
“to distribute not less than two-thirds among such educational or - 
literary. institutions, or for such educational purposes, as they may. 
determine, in the States for whose benefit the income is now | 
appointed to be used. The remainder may be distributed by: the 
trustees for educational or literary purposes, wherever they may 
deem it expedient.” 
Up to November 4, 1869, when Mr. Peabody died, he gave 
much time and thought to this grand work. In accordance with “ 
his views, it is probable that in a few years the trust will be closed, 
and two or three high normal colleges be the recipients oft

ville’ roped correspondent: with him, looking to the establish- 
ment of a grand central nernial college in Tennessee. . Dr. Sears 
visited’ Nashville vonaaly tl 1875, when this plan became a. 
reality.” ¢. “Ds 
The State at fret give ‘only its name. The University of. Nash- — 
ville ‘furnished extensive grounds, with large and commodious 
buildings, not to be estimated at less than two hundred thousand _ 
dollars in value. The Peabody Trust furnished funds to support ' 
the institution. In. 1881 the State, for the first time, made an 
appropriation. -In 1883, the General Assembly gave ten thousand © 
dollars per annum for the general purposes of the College, subject 
to the order of the State Board of Education. ss 
How this fund has been expended, and what is the present e¢ con= 
dition of the College, may be learned from the following report 
from the Chancellor of the University of Nashville to the. State 
Board of Fduostion : :

foe STATE NORMAL ‘COLLEGE. 
REPORT OF THE CHANCELLOR OF THE UNIVERSITY OF NASHVILLE. 
  
To the State Board of Education of Tennessee. 
GenTLEMEN :—I beg leave to present herewith a, report of the 
State Normal College, for the two years ending September 1, 1884. 
This report will be, however, mainly a summary of reports presented ; 
to your honorable body, from time to time, during this ‘period. . 
The whole number of different students in attendance has-been 
265, of whom 101 were male and 164 females. One hundred were 
from Tennessee. : eS 
+ The health of the students has been exceptionally good ; and, were 
due regard paid in every case to the requirement that students shall ° 
be in good health at the time of admission, it is believed that, with 
the constant watchfulness observed at the College, and the appliances 
used to promote health and vigor, physical disability might be re-. 
duced to its minimum. 
In common with many of our most important institutions we suf- 
fered some disturbance, from a few distontented persons, during the _. 
autumn and winter of 1883-4, who, as is commonly the case, made 
the most of opportunities for trouble. But the cloud soon passed 
away, leaving the College more firmly seated than ever in the eon- 
fidence and affection of the commiunity; and the period covered by 
this report closed with a full measure of its characteristic order and — 
quietness, and after one of its most successful commencements, at 
which a class of thirty-seven “took their degrees.” It is but just to 
add that the students generally have shown a commendable interest 
in the work required of them at the College, and a determination tov 
make the best possible use of the-great advantages afforded them. 
_ The College, as an appropriate and efficient institution for the in- , 
struction and training of teachers, has certainly met with increasing 
favor, and testimony is abundant that its diploma, or a certificate 
from its President, is an almost sure passport. to the, best grades of 
employment. . . 
( INCREASE OF NUMBERS. 
It would be easy to increase the number of the students almost 
without limit, by lowering the standard of scholarship, and becom- ’
-P-A-G-E-58
: (58) oe 
ing less determined that those who so freely enjoy these. privileges 
shall give to the public the benefit of their acquisitions. — ~ z 
It cannot be expected, however, that this or any other institution. . 
for the training of teachers exclusively, will furnish all that are re- +- 
quired to conduct the hundreds of schools of different grades in this — 
community, but it is confidently hoped and believed that every. 
teacher sent out with the full approbation of the College will exert 
so wise, enlightened and powerful an influence over a wide region, 
as not only to offer to the public the best examples of school man- 
agement and instruction, but~also to awaken and fostex a desire 
among ‘surrounding teachers to do their work in the most skillful 
and philosophic manner. One well-instructed and trained teacher’, 
will become, obviously, a source of knowledge, enlightertment and 
encouragement, so powerful ‘as to render his services, however mod-* 
. estly put forth, invaluable. : 
We might, however, without the disastrous measure of winking at. 
inferior ability and scholarship, and lowering our standard of in- 
struction—and with a comparatively small additional expense—ed— 
ucate @ much larger number than we do, were the inducements for’ 
youtg men and women to devote their best energies to the teacher’s.. - 
profession sufficiently great, and were the business sp attractive and - 
remunerative as to lead persons, suitably endowed by nature, to give 
up two or three years of time and labor, involving considerable out 
right expense, to the work of preparation, with nothing to allure, 
but the prospect of irksome confinement among children, with unre- 
mitting drafts upon sympathy, patience, nerve-power and almost. 
every resource; often at the mercy of the merest whim, caprice or. - 
prejudice, with small compensation, granted for a limited number of 
months only, each year, and with but little reason to expect that. 
their most self-denying efforts will ever result in more than a mere” : 
pecuniary competency. It may indeed be true that, if faithful, de- 
voted, earnest, the time will come when they shall find, “ Well done, 
good and faithful servants,’ emblazoned against their names on 
Heaven’s imperishable scrolls; yet, to most, the reward in this 
world seems slow in coming. : 
At present, attractive enterprises and employments, requiring but. 
little time or labor to meet their demands, entice our young men. 
and women on every side. The bold, active, intelligent, whom we 
most need in the teacher’s profession, are the first to see in them an |
-P-A-G-E-59
  (59) 
abundant opportunity for the present exercise of all their powers, 
_and in the not distant future, the glittering prizes of wealth and | 
honor. | It is easy to see that the teacher’s occupation must be made- 
equally attractive and prospectively remunerative, or it will be re- 
legated in a great measure to inferior persons, as unworthy of the 
best types of young manhood. Until this is the case, we shall look... - 
in vain for large numbers of candidates for our best normal institu- : 
tions, —while just in proportion, as this grandest of professions, could. 
everyone see it in that light, approximates this condition of affairs, 
will the best blood of the community flow into them, 
BUILDINGS AND GROUNDS. 
The buildings and grounds occupied by the College, as is. well” 
known, belong tothe University of Nashville, whose fitst century 
the coming year completes, Yts enlightened Board of Trust are not: 
only devoting their large property, with comparatively small re- 
serves or conditions, to promote normal instruction and to secure 
to Tennessee the benefits of what the distinguished chairman of “ the- 
Peabody , Education, Fund,” Hon. Robt. C. Winthorp, LL. D., in 
his opening address at their last anual meeting, designates as “OUR: 
errat Norma ConiEar, at NasHvi.in,” but have never hesi- ~ 
tated to permit alterations and changes in buildings and premises, to. 
meet the wants of the College, to be made, or to comply with every 
requisition within their corporate power. 
~The buildings which were greatly dilapidated by the exigencies 
of war, when we first took possession, are gradually approaching a- 
state of comparative soundness—but will require more or less repairs- 
each year. Should the number of students, which fills our rooms at 
the present time to nearly their full capacity, be much increased, some- 
additions would become necessary. ‘The grounds, which have been 
rescued from weeds and barrenness, are already becoming, in some 
measure, the requirements of a great and prosperous institution. 
More grading will have to. be done, as time ‘passes, paths made, 
drives laid out, and the whole must, ere long, be surrounded by an

-P-A-G-E-60

The improvements and additions already made or in “progress, 
_ considering the small sum of money used for the purpose, are be- 
lieved to have been judicious and successful. Among them I would | 
particularly call attention to the» 
EWING GYMNASIUM, . woe 
‘Named for the venerable President of the University Board of 
Trust, and, I believe, its oldestliving graduate. The building oc- 
eupies in part the site of the “Old Faculty House,” so called, or, 
“yather, is a portion of that building, detached and remodeled in 
such manner as to adapt it to the purposes of a gymuasium ; at the 
same time constituting an agreeable and appropriate feature of the 
buildings and grounds. 
The apparatus, which is of the most modern and approved kind, 
was furnished by Dr. D. A. Sargent, the learned scientist, and direc- 
tor of the Hemingway Gymuasium, at Cambridge, the largest and 
most successful institution for physical development and culture in 
this country, where more than a thousand men are in daily attend- 
‘ance; and is the same as used by the “ Athletic Associations” of Sts. 
Louis, Boston, Johns Hopkins University, Amherst College, the: . 
University of Virginia, ete. - . 
Its design is, of course, in part, to offer a source of rational amuse~ 
ments to the students, but more particularly to promote health, 
trength and development in accordance with the advanced knowl- 
edge of the times in anatomy, physiology and hygiene; and thus -- 
not only to prepare our students, by study and exercise, for the - 
wearing duties of the teacher’s profession, but also to instruct and ~ 
_ train the children and. young persons committed to their care, so» 
' that they may be in a condition to meet the demands which will be 
made upon them in actual life. . 
The gentlemen are to be placed under the care of a skilled instruc- 
tor, whom. we have arranged to employ in connection with Vander~ 
bilt University; hjs time being divided between the two institutions" 
equally, and both contributing a proportionate share of his compen- * 
| sation. . 
The ladies at the College are to be in charge ofa lady director, 
who. is not only skilled in gymnastic exercises, but who, by study 
and training, is fully acquainted with the character and requirements — 
’ Of her sex. She will make the pupils a study individually, and then

presoribe the nature and amount of exercise » best: adapted to their © - 
condition. 
It will be expected that she will look after-the sick, when there 
are such, and give the aid and advice required by their. condition.» 
It seems to be the universal opinion of medical men and educators. 
’ that our sanitary gymnasium is one of the most important of the re- ~. 
cent improvements at the College, and is destined to exert a power-_ 
ful influence upon physical training throughout the South. Some of 
these gentlemen, among whom are Dr. Lindsey, Dr. Plunket, Dr. - 
Wright—the vigilant and distinguished officers of the State Board o 
of Health—and Dr. Maddin, of the City Boafd, have made a per- “ 
sonal inspection. oh 
In this connection, I beg leave to call the attention of the Board 
to‘another of the appliances used at the College for the promotion - — 
of the well-being of the students, which has attracted considerable 
attention, as an unique and desirable feature of the College. It is 
called a “ Board of Health and Comfort,” and will be found described 
in Appendix “8B,” to this report. | 
THE LABORATORY. 
A portion of Lindsley Hall, which was rescued from decay and 
tuin a few years ago, and made an important.addition: to the College 
buildings, has been remodeled, and is now being fitted up as.a working ~ 
chemical laboratory, and will be, when completed and furnished 
with necessary apparatus, one of the most éxtensive, convenient and 
best appointed laboratories in this part of the country. It will be 
placed in charge of Prof. W. C. Day, Ph. D., of Baltimore, Md., as 
instructor in chemistry and natural science, who comes to us from 
St. John’s College, at Annapolis, Md., and on the most unqualified | 
recommendation of Dr. Ira Remsen, the distinguished chemist of 
Johns Hopkins University, where, after graduating, he won, by. 
merit, a fellowship, and, finally, the significant degree of “Doctor of 
Philosophy.” 
By this arrangement, all our students will have opportunity for- 
obtaining a practical knowledge of one of the most important, as 
well as most progressive, natural sciences, while such as wish to pur- 
sue the study as a\specialty will have the most favorable advantages. 
Agricultural chemistry, metallurgy, and all that. belongs to the re- 
ducing and assaying of ores, so important when viewed in connec-..

tion with the development of the natural resources of the State 
together with the analyses required from time to time by the State 
_ Board of Health, etc., may thus be carried on under the most 
favorable conditions. : 
PEABODY SCHOLARSHIPS. 
It is well known that a number of scholarships were established - 
at the College in the year 1876, by the trustees of the Peabody Ed- 
‘ucation Fund, “ for the encouragement and aid of students from the - 
different Southern States, whose characters, abilities, general culture 
‘and health give special promise of usefulness as teachets.” This 
number has now reached one hundred and fourteen, and is appor- 
tioned among these States by the “General Agent” of the Board. 
“These scholarships are in much request, and are kept as full asthe 
contingencies of sickness, etc., will permit. 
The nominations to the scholarships are made by the Superinten-_ 
‘dents of Public Instruction, in the different States, on the conditions 
prescribed by the Fund supporting them. I take great pleasure in 
stating that these gentlemen, as an almost universal rule, have per- 
formed this responsible and sometimes burdensome duty with signal 
intelligence, conscientiousness and desire to promote the objects for 
which the scholarships were established. : 
“These scholarships,” however (I quote from the “ Requirements, 
_ete.,”) “will, in no casé, be continued’ to students whose rank or. 
‘standing is low, whose general demeanor is objectionable, who do 
not give promise of usefulness as teachers, or whose health:or other. 
circumstances Prevent constant attendance on or performance of 
College duties.” 
Fourteen scholarships, the largest number given to any State, 
worth twenty-eight hundred dollars a year, were apportioned to 
‘Tennessee, i in the year 1883, in response to an act of her Legislature, 
‘appropriating ten thousand dollars annually to aid in the support of. 
‘the College.

Keeping. /
-P-A-G-E-65
    (ey oe 
“These officers shall hold their office ‘ until others » are chosen in 
their Place. 
DUTIES. 
  It shall be the duty of each health officer to qualify himself as as . 
soon as possible after election, by making himself thoroughly ac- 
quainted with the methods by. which the room in his charge is. 
. warmed and ventilated, and the general principles of warming and 
ventilation as applied to the promotion of the health- and. comfort, - 
of the students, as he can; and these methods and principles are to. 
be brought up and studied at every meeting until understood by 
every member. 
The entire charge of radiators, registers, windows, thermometers, OS 
etc., is to be given to the officer of the room, and no. other student - . 
is to be allowed at any time, either during sessions or before or. 
after, to interfere with them. _ 
_. Every such officer shall, once or - twieg, at least during each’ ses-_ 
sion, go where he can fill his Jungs with pure air, and on returning 
to his room thus ascertain the condition of it. 
‘The Board of Health and Comfort may, from time to time, ap- 
- point..one of their members to bring ‘before the students of the 
College, and discuss in the form of. lecture or essay, any topic con- 
nected with the duties of their office, said lecture or essay having 
been read before the whole board and approved by them. Meetings 
for this purpose shall be called in consultation with and by cohsent 
of.the President of the College.

taken to instruct new members in the duties of their office. 
. The Board of Health and Comfort shall bring to the notice of 
the. Chancellor of the University any other matter, in which the 
health and comfort of students are conosrned, which they may 
think requires attention. 
The board shall also take charge of the Chapel, and inspect ihe 
‘ventilation, ete., and of any other place where public meetings of 
the College may be held, and shall detail one or more of their mem- 
bers for that purpose. .

APPEALS, ETC. 
Every student who feels aggrieved by the manner in which the 
officer of his room performs, ‘or neglects his duties, shall -be ac- 
corded patient and respectful hearing.by said officer, who shall, if 
in his judgment such a course is consistent with a due regard for 
the welfare of the room, accede to his wishes, but if the student 
aggrieved is not satisfied, he may appeal to the whole board, in 
which case the appeal must be in writing and the board ‘shall aet 
thereon without further delay. Should the board fail to give 
satisfaction, a farther appeal may ‘be taken to the President of the 
college before whom all parties shall be heard.

give his views on any subject connected with the duties of ‘the 
board, at any time. 
No additions to or change in the rales, etc., shall be.tnade with- 
out the sanction of the President of the College: 
  
COLORED. NORMAL SCHOLARSHIPS. 
‘Tennessee has a people within a people, and the organic law of 
~ the Commonwealth requires the public authorities to make equal 
though separate provisions for the educational wants of each race. 
Here again the State has been singularly fortunate in receiving 
most liberal help from Christian philanthropists outside. Six well 
* furnished colleges for educating colored people have been estab- 
lished. in different quarters of the State. — 
The statement given below furnishes all the particulars likely | to 
be required. The State Board of Education, together. with the 
/ Superintendent of Public Instruction, make the rules and regula. 
tions governing the colored normal scholarships. . \

In reviewing the whole field, the Board would state that all- the. 
‘scholars, whether white or colored, have the benefit of competent — 
teachers, and of institutions with buildings and equipment which, 
entitle them to rank in the first class. 
The State Normal College has been repeatedly inspected ‘by 
members of the-Board of Education. No expenditures have been. 
“made without the previous consent of the Board. No bills have™ 
been: paid unless first carefully examined and approved by the — 
auditing committee, through its chairman, the Governor. “ 
Tennessee has several first-class normal colleges, training each 
year more than one hundred and sixty Tennesseans for service in . 
our. public’ schools, at less cost per annum than New York or . 
' Tilinois expend on the current expenses of a single one of their ” 
~ normal. colleges, . 
All of which is respectfully submitted, in behalf of the Board, ty

SCHOOL HYGIENE. 
    
  ~ I make the following éxtracts from the valuable ‘report of Dr, hay 
“Daniel F. Wright, M. D., member of the State Board of Health: 
‘and Chairman of the Committee on School Hygiéne. These extracts : 
  are very suggestive, and I hope will Prove of much benefit to. the - 
. teachers of Tennessee : 
  THE SCHOOL MACHINE WORRY.” ’ : ae 
But there is another mode of _competition which affects those af 
rather lower down in the scale, and some. of them ‘more profoundly, . 
perhaps, than the class above described ; at least. a larger number: 
‘axe brought under its influence. I speak of the incessant push.to 
keep scholars up with the. studies of their grades, which they have 
to do under penalty of falling to a lower grade. This.peculiar atim- 
ulus takes effect upon a larger number than any other, and is, in'fact, 
the chief motor-power which keeps the whole in motion. It differs 
from that previously described in this, that the exciting motive in 
the one is the hope of getting ahead, in the other the fear of falling 
behind—of loosing grade, in short. Now, hope is.an elevating 
agency, fear a depressing one. Here comes in that peculiar state of 
mind, now thoroughly recognized by nervous pathologists, called 
‘by them worry. It was first used, I believe, by Forbes Winslow, | 
' in reference to numerous cases of dementia occurring among business 
men. It was shown that, in most such cases, it-was not overexertion 
that produced insanity, or-at least not that alone, but excessive 
labor under depressing circumstances—overwork, with fear and des- 
pair in the back-ground ; thus, while business is prosperous, a healthy - 
man can get through an astonishing amount of work without 
_ injury, but let the affairs become involved with daily increasing 
complications ominous of failure, and let the business increase its - 
exactions on the overwrought brain, while hope gives way to fore-.
-P-A-G-E-70
  (70 ): 
boding and foreboding to dread and dread to despair—then the ‘hare 
rassed brain gives way under the double burden of work ‘and 
despondeney, and our lunatic asylums are full of worry so produced. 
Worry, then, is the prevailing trouble of large schools in which the 
machine is worked with vigor and energy characteristic of the modern 
_ publie school system. A boy finds himself literally part of a great 
machine there, -a single cog of a single wheel, perhaps, but the ma- . 
chine works on and he must work with it or be crushed by it; he. feels ' 
.that he must keep up with the machine and make his pride, and he 
feels every day less able to do so ; failure implies disgrace, loss of self-_ 
respect and self-confidence, grieved and, perhaps, angry parents, the“ 
jeers of school-fellows; he redoubles his efforts and goes home with 
headache—ultimately sickness compels him to desist, he loses days,. 
perhaps weeks, and finally the grade. Fortunate is he if no more 
permanent injury is done to a nervous system subject to such tension. 
Added to all these mortifications is an undefined sense of injury ;. 
he feels that he is not less intelligent than those who trample him . 
down-in the race, he can’t tell. why, and he is right, for it is not 
the stupid and naturally defective alone who fail under this trial ; 
frequently the beaten scholar has a better mind than he who walks - 
. over him. At the risk of prolixity, I must here distinguish two 
types of youthful intellect not sufficiently discriminated between in 
school praetice—they are the perceptive and reflective types. The 
perceptive boy catches an idea ‘quickly, retains it well, and applies 
it promptly ; he is bright and active in school and at ‘play; the - 
- machine works well with him, and his advance is rapid; his teagher- 
makes.a brag scholar of him—but his is not the best mind there. 
- The reflective boy does not take it in so quickly, from the very fact 
that as the seed falls in deeper soil it takes it longer to sprout; his 
quicker rival sees a thing at onee, if he sees it at all; the reflective 
boy has to reason it out, and this takes time; the machine cannot , 
_ Stop for all this ; he is passed over, and, as this takes place frequently, ° 
he is gradually recognized as the stupid boy of the class. - The effect. 
on the boy himself depends upon his nervous organization ; if it. is. 
, Sensitive and irritable, he wears himself out with futile efforts to 
_ keep up; if it is leas impressible, he gradually subsides with a sullen’. 
contentedness into the stupid boy’s place, falling grade after grade, 
until his friends conclude. his case to be hopeless, and put him at 
-work they hope he can do. But stupid boys of this sort Have become
-P-A-G-E-71
  Cy 
some of our greatest men, Sir Isaac Newton, ‘Bir Walter Scott, 
and hosts of other men, illustrious ‘for intellect, were recognized ~~ 
as stupid boys at school, and the phenomenon has been often stated | 
and wondered at, that, in so many cases, stupid school boyshave ~ 
become men of vast intellectual power. The solution is that, not: 
they but their teachers were stupid in not recognizing a type of, 
intellect which required other_than machine methods for its 8 develop a3 
ment. : 
But it is not with those who have survived. the blunders of their. 
school treatment and become great men that I am now concerned...” 
It is those who have more excitable nerves and a_less sfalwart framé,. >’ 
whose nerves have been torn to pieces by the inexorable working of: 
‘the machine, and whose spirit it cowed by repeated failure, that - 
are the victims of the machine.. I am not writing from theory, but-- 
-from observation. I have not only been engaged in education 
inyself in early life, but I-have been for several years a member of 
the Board of Education, in Clarksville, where the public schools are _ 
among the best in Tennessee, and the system of instrisction includes . 
all the modern improvements. . As a partof the duties of that office, 
Lhave practiced a constant inspection of the schools while at work, 
and familiarized myself with the methods of teaching and discipline 
and their results, : 
_And what are these results? Alas! I cannot give statistics for 
them, for such results have never been ‘tabulated, and cannot be 
tabulated ; they are read in their effects ini. after life, producing 
helpless, hysterical. women, and feeble, irritable men, producing 
neuralgia, and as their extreme results, epilepsy, insanity and idiocy. 
I am conscious that this will be looked upon as exaggeration, and I 
have no remedy for that impression, though I am certain that it is 
within the truth. One fact, however, I can state: In the grammar © 
department of the schools I have mentioned, consisting of a number 
of scholars varying from. 120 to over 200, five cases of chorea 
occurred during the session which closed last’ June... The cases 
- yielded readily to treatment while the patients were removed from 
the school, but the malady always returned if they. returned to their 
desks. Now, it will be said.that five cases out of two hundred 
scholars is not a very serious amount of disease, but I take it asa 
test of the tendencies of the school system. M. Rufz, inthe French 
Dictionary of Medicine, finds 189 cases of choera out of:32,976 chil-.. .

dren admitted to the children’s hospital of Paris; this is an’average 
of one and one-tenth :per cent. on the whole number of sick children, - 
while the school in question gives an average of two and a -half per. 
cent. out of all sorts—sick and well. Granted, then, that-our five 
cases out of two hundred is nota very serious matter (though the 
parents of these five probably think otherwise), the occurrence of 
these cases is a test phenomenon which makes it certain that.a vast 
amount of nervous trouble must prevail there of a less grave and 
conspicuous character. 
[The body of this report was necessarily written before reports 
could be received from other schools in Tennessee, which will ac- ~ 
eount for our observations being: limited to the schools of one 
moderate size town. These schools are admitted, however, to be . 
among the best regulated in the State.] 
‘ - [cannot dismiss this portion of my subject without calling atten- 
tion to the effects of this storm.and stress in our school system upon 
the teachers as well as the scholars. Let it be remembered that 
‘almost all the teachers in our public schools, except the superintend~ - 
ents, are now females. I believe it. will be found that a truly 
‘healthy person among them is the exception, rather than the rule; 
at least if the observation is made.in June, toward the close of the 
session’s work, Nor can it be considered an accidental coincidence 
that, in this State, an ex-State superintendent and the existing 
superintendent of the largest city schoos in the State are palsied men, 
I fear that boards of education limit their idea of their duty too 
much to the one purpose of getting the largest amount of.work out 
of their employes at-the lowest possible price. So narrow a’ method: 
as this defeats its own purpose ; a system which thus squanders the 
health and energy of teachers can never be advantageous to the 
/pupils ; the self: possession and tranquility of mind which are essen- _ 
tial to the qualification of a good teacher are entirely incompatible 
with the harrassed and exhausted nervous systems which are the in-~ 
evitable consequence of our machine system of education, Exheust- 
ad nerves are irritable nerves, and irritability is the worst defect a 
teacher can have. Let our school directors, therefore, reflect that 
a hard. bargain ‘with their teachers is a still harder bargain with .. 
their children. 7 
THE REMEDY. . 
But readers will, long ere this, have begun to profound the ques-— 
 
-P-A-G-E-73
(73) cen 
tion, what is your remedy ?” What do you want done? Such ques- 
tions are always very difficult to answer, and in this cage a -complete 
remedy would be tantamount to a revolution in our. public school. 
system ; for the errors out of which all ‘these evils spring may be | 
comprised under two heads: me N 
First—Not enough teachers for the number of scholars. oe 
Second—Too much teaching crowded into too short a time. ! 
.1, Children cannot be taught in great masses except by general - 
rules ; 3; in other words, by machine methods. - What we have been: 
endeavoring to -show is that the evils in our methods arise froma: 
want of discrimination, what answers for a majority crushes a minor-_ 
ity; discrimination is needed between boys and girls, after a cértain 
age, and between boys of a different. mental type. - Buta teacher ~~ 
who has from fifty to seventy-five “scholars to teach cannot discrim- ~” 
_ inate, and, in our very best schpols, many have.at’ times more on / 
their hands than that. One teacher to’ fifty-six scholars seems to 
be the proportion agreed upon for public schools North and South, 
and I have not the least doubt that‘one in forty would furnish as’ 
mich as one teacher could attend to with. good results to both teacki- 
er and pupil. ‘But can ‘this be farnished?. Not ‘under existing 
arrangements without larger appropriations, and I have practical 
knowledge of the difficulty of getting city and county authorities to‘ 
_ consent even to the existing school taxes. I fear it will. be many . 
years before an increase will obtain consideration. 
I can only point out the evil, therefore; to suggest the remedy 
would be to overhaul the whole fabric of our existing.school system, 
which would be out of place in the Present reports. i 
INFECTIOUS. DISEASES. 
~ The Jaws of Tennessee already ‘forbid the attendance of children _ 
suffering under infectious diseases at public. schools; it was probably 
by an oversight that they failed to require vaccination as a condition 
of attendance in all cases where the child had not had small-pox or 
- variola. This board would, I respectfully submit, do well to urge the 
addition of such a provision ;. many of our city schools have a mu- 
nicipal ordinance to that efféct,and I have seen it work.well beyond 
the limits of the school, when enforced, by calling general attention 
to the matter, and so bringing about’ it general vaccination throughout . 
a community. : 
\
-P-A-G-E-74
(TH) 
- But there is a class of diseases not properly speaking infectious, 
the spreading of which should be provided against in schools ;' they . 
are not propagated by infection, but by imitation. These are the - 
“nervous affections, epilepsy, chorea and hysteria. Where any one of 
these occurs, the patient ought to be instantly removed from the 
sight of the other pupils, or the same disease will be very likely, ex- 
- cited in.some of them. 
Stamimering is a nervous disease, seldom acquired elsewhere than 
at school, and it is acquired there in two ways, by imitation and by 
impatient, irritating treatment in class. Of course, a child should 
not be excluded for so‘slight a cause as this, but the acquisition of © 
the habit can be prevented, and the habit itself cured in its incep-- 
tive stage, by care and patience on the part of the teacher. The-firat 
time a child commences a stuttering answer in class, he should be 
stopped gently and-kindly, told to collect his thoughts and not speak 
till he is quite ready with what he has to say; above all, other. pu- _ 
pils should not-be allowed to prompt or correct him until he has’ 
_ either succeeded or failed without interruption. After first stopping- 
lim, he should be asked whether he understands the question, and - 
if not, it should be repeated and explained, and then the pupil:told 
to take his time about it, and, if the habit has not been fully formed, 
‘he will probably answer without a stutter. On the other hand, a 
little impatience on the part of the teacher on such occasions will go 
far to establish stammering, first as a habit, and afterwards as a dis- 
ease, liable to last for life. . 
HYGIENE OF THE SCHOOL BUILDING AND PREMISES. ~ 
The great body of reports like the present is generally occupied , 
with the treatment of this subject. Ido not follow the example. 
‘Most of the topics discussed under this head belong to general. hy- 
giene, and‘should be discussed in that department. Thus, much is 
generally said about the drainage and sewerage of school premises. 
On this I have only to say that the efficiency of these depends very ~ 
largely upon the sewerage and drainage of the town in which the. 
schools are placed. If the general arrangements for these purposes- 
"are bad, those of thé school cannot be good. On this head, then, 
-nothing' need be said, except that the privies ought to be placed ata 
‘gufficient. distance from the school-house, and from the cistern or 
other provisions for water supply (at least fifty feet from either), 
‘ on -
-P-A-G-E-75
  (75 ) 
. and that the surface-water should be prevented from penetrating to 
the cellar. Of the interior of the building, something must be said 
in-reference to ventilation and lighting; in other words, te: matters - 
affecting the respiration and visual powers of the inmates. 
RESPIRATION. 
It has been the custom in works on architectural hygiene to pre-- 
soribe the number of cubic feet to be occupied by a given number 
of inmates; more recently, and more philosophically, it has been 
made the criterion that the whole mass of the air in a room occupied 
by many people should be capable of being frequently changed. The 
calculation is received that a minimum of 2,000 feet for every in- 
mate should be entirely removed and replaced by fresh air every 
hour;and very complicated’ apparatus has been invented for the 
purpose of effecting this, far beyond the reach of public schools in 
Tennessee. To show the impracticability of this, Ihave made a cal- 
culation of what this would imply in a school-room under my obser- 
vation... The room is 55 by 35 feet, and 14 feet high, which gives: 
Cubic dimension of room. : . . 26,950 
*Mass of air to be changed per hour . 200,000 
*T assume the room to be occupied by-100 pupils; unfortunately, it in fact con- 
tains nearly 200, at times. 
Dividing the latter number by the former, we get a quotiont of 
between 7 and 8; in other words, the whole mass of the air in the 
room would have to be changed between seven and eight times an 
hour ‘to’ fulfill the above requirements. There is certainly nota 
building in Tennessee, for school or any other purposes, in which . 
this could be done, and probably not many in the United States. 
Booth’s theater has probably effected this at an enormous expense, 
being considered a miracle of sanitary contrivance—a powerful 
steam engine is kept at work for the purpose during performances. 
Instead. of prescribing impracticable things, therefore, I will pre- 
sent some practicable suggestions for doing the best with more or 
less defeetive arrangements. 
I.:Let every window be constructed so that it can be opened at 
top as well as bottom. This, in winter time, will enable communi- 
cation with the outer air without bringing a draft upon the inmates. 
Tn every heated room the air hag an upward motion, on account of 
the greater rarity of hot than cold air. But,
-P-A-G-E-76
(76) . 
II. This motion will not be sufficient to exchange any considera- 
ble quantity of air, unless air is admitted from below as fast as it 
. can be rgmoved from above. Here comes the difficulty of avoiding 
injurious drafts. The disideratum is to admit air which is warm as 
well as fresh. Where the room is heated with hot air from a furnace 
in the basement, let the furnace-room communicate freely with the 
external air, which will be warmed by contact with the furnace, and 
let this warmed air be admitted to the school-room through perfor- 
ated metal plates in the floor. [I take it for granted that in this 
case the basement will not be used as an urinarium, though I have 
known of such outrages.] 
ILI. Let the room be, several times a day, emptied of pupils long / 
enough for all the windows to be thrown open, and complete venti~' 
lation effected. I think this can be carried out with less loss of time 
. than might be supposed. Thus, in graded schools, there is al- 
ways-a movement, once in a half hour, of scholars from the recita- 
tion room to the hall and vice versa.. Now let this movement once 
“an hour be made by a‘detour out of the room and round the play- 
“‘ground two or three‘ times, and while this is going on, let two or 
three pupils be detailed to open the windows at one tap of a bell, 
-and close them at a second, say five minutes afterward, and let the 
second tap be the signal for the return of the pupils to the building, 
and to their several destinations. The great ingenuity of modern 
. public-school teachers could, I am quite sure, effect this without the 
loss of more than five minutes additional to that now consumed, 
and that five minutes in time would be more than compensated by, 
the increased alacrity caused by the inhalation of that much oxygen. 
Contrivances-of this sort, which could be largely supplemented 
by the intelligence of teachers, once directed to the subject, would 
go far to counteract very defective arrangements for ventilation in 
the building. 
LIGHTING—-EFFECTS ON VISION. : a 
Strabismus and miopia, in other words, squinting and near-sight-. 
edness, are diseases very generally acquired at school ; a few words, 
therefore, must be said as to precautionary measures against them... 
Near-sightedness is acquired by too great a strain on those minute 
“museles.which adapt the eye to different distances, as well as to 
those which regulate the quantity of light admitted into the interior -
-P-A-G-E-77
(77) 
of. the ¢ organ. .It is therefore promoted by looking at objects too . 
small, or too far off for distinct vision. Hence, the distance of the 
blackboard and the size of the letters written on it; the position of 
the book on the desk, and the quantity of light thrown upon it, 
have much to do with the hygiene of the eye. ‘ 
: The blackboard should not have a shining surface, and all writ- 
: ing on it should be large ‘enough to be read without effort or strain- 
ing by every member of the class. It ought to be directly in front 
of the pupils, and its surface kept clean, so that there may be suffi 
cient contrast between the chalk and the. board. 
The desk at which the pupil studies should be inclined at sach an 
_ ‘angle.that the line from his eye to the middle of his book should . 
. strike the surface of the book at right angles. Most of the desks I. | 
havé examined are not, I think, sufficiently j inclined for this ;. in- 
deed, every peculiarity of vision requires a different angle. The -- 
‘ingenuity of manufacturers of school furniture would be well ap- 
- plied in inventing a school-desk with an adjustable-top, in which 
the angle could be adapted to the vision of each scholar. 
. Light should be so supplied, as that it is diffused equally in all - 
parti of the room, no pupil getting more or less than another, and 
none being exposed to the direct rays of the sun. Of course, this 
ean be only approximately effected. It has been advised: that it 
should come from only one side of the room, and that to the left 
of the pupil; but this arrangément is fatal to the equal diffusion of 
“Tight; it will always cause a light side and a dark side in the 
school-room. The principal light should come from the pupil’s 
left, and; if possible, from the north, which would obviate the fall- 
ing of “the sunshine directly on the pupil’s eyes. 
Windows may admit light in any other direction except in front 
of the pupil, preference being given to the west, which is behind 
him, and the south, which is on his right; but blinds should be 
"carefully adjusted on that side, so as to exclude the direct rays of. 
the sun. 
The only direction from which light should always be excluded 
is-in front of the scholars, which, according to the above, would be 
east. As there is not always a choice of directions, IT would recom- 
ménd-as ‘the best, when attainable, light from the left and from 
behind; the former from the north and the latter from the west. 
A white-washed ceiling aids much in eqalizing the diffusion of 
oy
-P-A-G-E-78
     
(78) 
light ; but the walls should never be. white, which is very trying 
to the eyes. A bluish gray, or a pale olive green, are restful colors 
desirable for them. 
Strabismus, or squinting, is promoted by any cause which tends 
to exercise one eye more than the other, as receiving light from 
only. one side, having the blackboard on one side instead of in front, 
both of which errors have already been: pointed out; but a much 
more fruitful cause of it is brain exhaustion from the many forms 
of overexcitement treated of in the early parts of this report ; such 
exhaustion leads to loca] disease in the brain, paralyzing one or 
more of the muscles which move the eyeball. : 
I .will, therefore, conclude here with recapitulating the jeading 
reforms which I consider should be aimed at. 
First: To separate the treatment of very young children en- 
tirely from the general system, assigning them to ladies who 
-combine the qualities of a tender mother with those of an enlight- 
-ened teacher. : 
Second: To increase the number of teachers in proportion to 
that of pupils, so as to render some discrimination possible, some 
attention to diversity of character. 
Third: To lengthen the recess and provide opportunity for 
systematic bodily exercise. 
Fourth: To separate the sexes after the age of thirteen. 
Postscriet.—Dr- Crichton Brown states, as his starting point, 
the large increase in the number of suicides in England, showing 
that, within the present century, their percentage of the whole 
population has quintupled, and that a very considerable item in 
this increasement is referable to juvenile suicides, including those 
under sixteen years of age. He also cites the statistics of insanity, | 
showing that 43,346 patients have been added to the number of 
_ registered Innaties within the last twenty years, which ig just the 
length of time since public education becamegeneral in England. 
This portentous array of facts he accounts for by what he ob- 
served in the schools above mentioned. The following may be 
taken as a sample of these observations :
-P-A-G-E-79
  (79) 
“Tt is now certain that more than one-third of the children at- 
tending elementary schools in London suffer from habitual head- 
ache. I have examined’ 6,580 children in elementary schools in 
London on the subject of headaches, and have found that 3,034, or 
46.1 per cent. profess to suffer from them habitually. Great pains © 
were taken to secure accurate returns. In one school containing 
‘381 -boys, 129 were sleep-talkers and twenty-eight sleep-walkers, 
this being a school in which home lessons were insisted upon. In 
- aechool of 432 girls, there were seventeen somnambulists, and in 
another of 382, there were twenty. Tabulated statistics shew, 
. furthermore, that 53.4 per cent. of the boys, and fifty-five per cent, 
of the girls, suffer from neuralgia and tooth-ache; and short- - 
‘-sightedness increases so rapidly that it threatens to become a 
national infirmity, as in Germany. A remarkable contrast to this 
state of affairs is offered in the schools of Scotland. Only twenty- 
three children (nine boys and fourteen girls) out of 335 complained 
. of headaches, which gives a percentage of 6.5 against 46.1 for 
London. One child, a nervons girl, out of the 335, complained of 
sleeplessness, and there was just one instance of short-sightedness, 
while not a somnambulist was to be found; the reason being that 
they are well fed on porridge and milk as the staple articles of diet, 
with broth, potatoes, butter, tea, and occasionally a bit of meat or 
“bacon. They #e warmly clad, and wear stout clogs.in winter and 
go barefooted in summer. They are much in the open and uncon- 
taminated air.” . 
It ought to be stated, however, that in London starvation is spec- 
: fied as one of the conditions which render this overpressure fatal ; 
in fact he enumerated three types of children who cannot bear it, 
the dull, the starved, and the delicate. 
_ Happily starvation is not an appreciable element of mischief in. 
Tennessee, and dullness is the exception, but delicacy of constitution 
is much more prevalent among our children than it is further north, 
especially among children of intellectual tastes and sensitive tem- 
peraments.

  RULES OF GOVERNMENT AND COURSES OF STUDY 
FOR 
GRADED SCEIOOLS. 
The following Course of Study and Rules for the Government of 
the Schools in the Second District of Knox County are inserted for 
the benefit of District Directors throughout the State who may de- 
sire to grade their schools: 
To the "Patrons of the Public Schools of the Second Distrit of Knox 
County, Tennessee: 
The Board of School Directors of your District, earnestly desiring 
to promote the educational interests under their charge, have pub-: 
lished a system for grading the schools of the District, and rules for 
their government. 
There can be but one opinion entertained by intelligent observers 
in regard to the necessity of reform in the management and control_ 
of our schools. For years they have been without prescribed course 
_of study. It is true that the law prescribes what shall be taught in 
the schools, but as it does not enter into the details of school man-. 
agement, but leaves them to the School Directors, it has heretofore 
been considered that the law was complied with if the branches re- 
quired by it were taught, some to one and othgrs to others, in the 
same school! Thus, under this management, each pupil was allowed 
to study ,to a considerable extent the branches only which suited his 
or her faney, and consequently many of our pupils know comipara- 
tively nothing of some branches, whilst they are perhaps advanced 
in others; and it is considered that the etter of the law, at least, has 
been observed, whilst, certainly, the intent of the law has been”

grossly disregarded, to the great detriment of the pupils. Pupils 
taught under this want of system have, on entering higher schools 
properly conducted, found, to their great mortification, that they 
were compelled to-begin again at the bottom of the ladder; others, 
on entering the duties of life, find, to their dismay, that they are far 
short of the desired mark, Under this want of system, pupils make, 
very frequently, but very poor progress in even what they study. 
There being no prescribed course to study, no examinations to un- 
dergo, and consequently no record of eaeh pupil’s proficiency, each 
succeeding teacher requires his pupils to begin their studies at the 
points of their text books that may sérike the teacher as proper, un— 
til (if he be-a good and conscientious teacher) he or she has the time 
to acquire.a knowledge of the proficiency of the pupils, when they 
will be classed according to the teacher’s judgment. Thus, perhaps, 
. from one to four weeks of the time of the school is consumed, and 
very little done. Then, what if the teacher is negligent, incompe- 
tent or lazy! How many pupils have been placed back in their text 
- ‘books and required to go over, time and again, the same studies 
aselessly ? How many pupils have had their aspirations crushed by 
this course? . 
. Again, the government of the schools being left altogether with 
teachers, without any rules prescribed by any authority to guide - 
‘them, we have had’ for results: some teachers who were charged 
with being too: “ tight,” and others with being too “loose;” some - 
schools, perhaps, models of good order, and others, examples of con- 
fusion ; the results being too much in conformity with the teacher’s 
temper or his natural inclinations, and not according to the dictates 
of reason. 
These, and other evils connected with uur schools, ought certainly 
be corrected. Our school sessions. are already too short, and we 
cannot afford to lose, through their mismanagement, the benefits we 
are entitled to derive from them. They are supported by taxes 
raised from the people, and which you pay from the earnings of 
honest, hard labor-»-from earnings obtained by the sweat of your 
brows—and it is our duty, as public officers, to see that this money 
be not expended uselessly. For this reason. we have put forth the 
‘plan for the management of our schools, which we present you now. 
The plan we present may perhaps not please every one. That we 
cannot expect. But we sincerely believe that what we have-done
-P-A-G-E-83
  ( 88) 
. wis cabsolntely necessary, and we did it for the “ « public good.” 
Therefore, we ask your cordial support for the measures we have. 
adopted. .We ask for these measures the co-operation of évery ‘pa- 
rent; and pupil in the district. All our teachers, whom we have 
consultéd in this matter, have nobly promised their co-operation to «. 
carry out our plan, and we trust we can also rely on both parents. 
“and pupils, and that they will cheerfully comply with what is re- 
avired for their good. Respectfally, -

  , thought has vanished, and it is now well known that they | have 
“)eome to stay 
  _. “We have a seating capacity for seventy pupils more than we had 
“ Jast year, and every-seat has been taken. We have not a vacant seat. 
Modern methods of instruction and government are used by all 
the teachers, and with perfect satisfaction. . 
I mention one thing in particlar: Pupils are. permitted to retire 
from the room at pleasure, and on returning they write on a card 
the time retired and time returned and sign name in full. The 
- teacher collects these cards and makes.a record of the same. No 
“pupil has abused this privilege. Pupils are taught to do right from 
principle and not from fear. \ 
We have in contemplation a new building, or rather the remod- 
~ eling the one we now have, after the plan of the celebrated Howard 
School in the city of Nashville.-This we trust will be consummated 
before the opening of schools next year. 
At this writing, we are preparing an exhibit of our schools . 
and school work for the Southern Exposition which meets in New 
Orleans, December next. Our exhibit will consist of written reci- 
tations and written examinations, photographs of each school room 
with the pupils at work, photographs of each buildings also photo- 
graphs of the teachers and members of the Board of Education. 
The written work.-will be that done in actual work by each pupil 
in school, from the second grade to the eighth grade inclusive. The 
-work of the first grade will be: photographed from the slates. The 
colored schools.and pupils receiving the same attention and repre- 
sentation of work done as the whites.

  THE YEAR’S 3 vecon. : 
Owing to the fact that the statistics of the vidi) re schools 
- were not included in those of the report of 1882,’ and the increase 
in the scholastic population of the other eight wards has been great- 
er than for some years past, the increase for the current year in 
enrollment, expense, number of teachers employed, etc., is greater 
. than that of any previous one. The increase in enrollment is 472; 
in the-expenses of the schools, $4,500.61; in the number of teach- 
ersemployed, 10. From the scholastic census (4,817) of the present 
year, it appears that there has been an increase of 502 of those who 
are entitled to seats in the public schools. This will necessitate 
an increase of accommodations, and as the Treasurer says in his re- 
port, an additional outlay of as least $3,000 during the coming year. 
The work of the schools was, for a short period at the beginning 
of the year, hindered by the want of accommodations, both in the 
Peabody and Austin Schools. This resulted in the formation of 
- me LIBRARY 
ae, MIDDLE TENNESSEE STavE COLLECT / MURFREESBORO, TENNESSEE
-P-A-G-E-100
(100 ) 
the Broad Street School in the 8th ward, and the relinquishment 
by Miss Austin of the room formerly occupied by her as an indus- 
trial school. But the former arrangement hag not worked as well 
-as could be desired. The location of the school is too remote for 
thoge living in the extreme limits of the 7th ward, so that in one 
case at least, if not others, the pupil was unable to attend school, 
and the attendance on the part of the whole school was poor. It 
* is to be hoped that not only will a school-house soon be built in the 
8th ward, but that the Peabody will be enlarged to meet the needs 
of that part of the city. : 
The outlook at the beginning of the:year was not very encourag- 
ing, when one of our most efficient teachers, Mr. Chas. Mason, resign- 
ed to take charge of the Jonesboro graded schools. To fill his place _ 
_ required transfers, which for a time interfered with the working of 
the schools. This resulted in placing Mr. W. M. Rogers in charge 
' of the Peabodys ‘a ( position which he has filled with ability and effi- 
ciency. ‘Os iN AM Ve l 
Tho etal ‘cost per  pagdénrellea has increased. 74 cents ; per pupil 
beloagia , 28 cents; per pupil: attending, 20 cents. The increase 
-in thé Yast two is son idePably below that of 1882-83, being $1.49 
per pupil ‘belonging’ and $1, 7} per pupil attending. The increase 
., in the-cost ‘ihe schools,’ t by year, is due, of course, princi- 
pally to: the cost of tuition; which necessitates additional outlay for 
new teachers.and an increase of the salaries of those already employ- 
ed by the Ban win ” 
The efforts o' ay entrusted with the work of instruction has been 
to make it as thorough and efficient as possible. 
Of course, there are defects and faults in our methods, which the 
eensorious and hypereritical make the most of, but our constant aim 
shall be to remove the one and correct the other.

FINANCES, 
In consequence of the change in the plan of the Municipal Gov- 
ernment having occurred in the midst of the session, the scheol 
_,moneys have passed through the hands of two different sets: of 
disbursing officers. The system of book-keeping adopted for the 
auditor now in charge, is so dissimilar from that used by the for- 
mer treasurer, as to render it very difficult, if not wholly imprac- 
ticable, to obtain an account of payments made, classified under 
the usual heads. We have, therefore, as a more satisfactory 
exhibit, instead of giving these two somewhat discordant reports, _ 
' made up from them and our ‘check-book the following statement: °

  es 
Comparing the above figures with those of the preceding year, we 
find the following significant differences: In the scholastic enume- 
ration there has been an increase of 534, while the number enrolled 
is 905 greater, and the average number belonging and average at- 
tendance have increased yespectively 1,174 and 1,090. 
It is therefore evident that while the scholastic population of the 
city is growing at rather more than a normal rate, the number en- , 
tering the schools has been proportionately much larger. — 
_ This is a gratifying proof of the undiminished favor in which the . 
system is held by the public, and the higher appreciation of ‘its ad- 
vantages upon the part of the youth of the city. 
_ We have with difficulty been able to accommodate this increased 
* number by employing nine additional teachers and by increasing 
. the’size of classes, there having been 40 pupils sesigned toa teacher, 
instead of 36 last year. / 
The per cents of attendance on enrollment and ¢ on number be- 
longing show that those entering were as regularly in their places 
as formerly, notwithstanding there were frequent obstacles presented 
in the prevalence of contagious diseasés and an unusually severe 
winter,

INSTRUCTION. 
The course of study has undergone no material change since our 
last annual statement, except that, as at the time was suggested, 
part of the work in the Sixth and Seventh grades has been redis- 
tributed so’ as to relieve them, and to add to that required in the 
Eighth. . 
In order to secure more uniform results in teaching, the studies- 
of each grade have been separated by quarterly limits, within which” 
instruction must be given for each successive interval. That is to 
say, teachers must not adyance beyond the point fixed in the course, 
‘but, having reached it, shall spend the time in reviews. It is 
greatly to be preferred, however; and teachers are required as nearly 
as possible to make the work of pupils-easily progressive, so as to 
complete it with the close of each quarter, leaving no time for re- 
viewing. ‘The true practice is to teach thoroughly as. we go, recal]- 
ing from day to day, if necessary, abtruse. principles, thus erecting 
the educational structure on a firm foundation and with permanently 
good walls, so.far-as it may have been built. The system of general _ 
reviews is, or inevitably degenerates into, a process of cramming,. 
and will always produce unsatisfactory results. 
The fault not unfrequently foumd with public schools, that they. 
Tequire to much of pupils, has been carefully avoided here, With. 
regular attendance and fair devotion to duty, the average child can 
easily accomplish the work assigned in the time allotted. If there 
are complaints they are most generally in the opposite direction, to 
the effect that parents think that children have too little to'do. This: 
is usually with reference to the lower grades, in which it is enjoined 
* upon teachers to require no home work in the first two years, and. 
as little as practicable in the third and fourth. We fear that some 
‘of those in charge in the two last, and even of higher grades, trané 
scend their orders in prescribing tasks to be done out of school, 
with pen and ink, such as copying text, transposing poetry, writing. , 
-analyses, ete. Children: generally are not provided at home with’ 
proper conveniences for doing such work, and hence it is poorly ex: | 
egated ; but such a course is most objectionable from its tendency | 
_t0-wear upon the’ energies and health of children by overtaxing . 
‘them.’ Under judicious’ management and in well regulated schoola- 
» they ‘will voluntarily do, the amount. of outside study necessary for 
‘maintaining a oreditable stand. For. those studiously” inclined    
   
-P-A-G-E-107
ae (107 ) 
home. encouragement. should be rather away from than toward. 
books, and laggards may best be reached by enlisting discreet, pa- 
rental influence. 
An educational journal truthfully says: “The most obvious 
- cause of the failure of formal education is the neglect of natural 
. lawa. We are in too much of a hurry. Instead of adapting our 
teaching as nature does, to the child’s developing powers and grow- | 
ing needs, we ply our little pupils with knowledge about which they — 
do not and cannot care, with the inevitable effect of disgusting . 
them with learning and delaying their mental. development.” 
Strangely this radical mistake is oftenest made, where it does the a 
greatest harm, in the primary schools, and a kindred error is not. * 
unfrequently the outgrowth of this one. Injudicious teachers, hav- 
’ ing, with the approval of ambitious parents, overtaxed the minds © 
of their-youthful charges, next devise hot-house processes for arous- 
ing interest, or adopt severe discipline to enforce it. The true rem- 
edy obviously is to be found in realizing that we are dealing with 
beings of varied faculties, which require normal, gradual exercise . 
for their development. The right ends to be sought are the forma- 
tion of correct habits of observing, feeling and acting, by training 
. the mind, cultivating the heart and controlling the will. These 
purposes necessarily qualify, and in fact determine, the means to be 
employed for their accomplishment. Hence, in teaching, the man- 
ner is much more important than the matter. Results depend not 
so much upon what is taught as how teaching is done. If mind is 
awakened, faculties sharpened, and the reasoning powers developed, 
it is a matter of secondary consideration what have been the sub- 
jects taught; but if only the memory has been exercised, and un- 
digested facts stored up in the mind, while the reason is clouded 
and self-reliance destroyed, the process may be perfect in theory, 
but is a failure in practice. 
This accounts for the wide difference in the character of instruction 
of different teachers and institutions of learning in which, perhaps, 
the same methods are used. In one you will find the children close 
observers, ready thinkers, confident in investigation, and withal 
modestly unconscious that they are proficient ; while in another the 
pupils will be very ready with prepared recitations and familiar 
formulas, easily confused with every new presentation of an old 
subject, wanting in individuality, but inordinately inflated with an
-P-A-G-E-108
( 108 ) 
over-estimate of their own attainments. Very naturally, too, their 
parents are as much elated and as badly deceived as they. Hence, 
teahers of this class often are dor.a time the most popular and the 
most successful to be found. 
This, then, is the true standard of comparison in determining: 
the relative merits of teachers. Profound attainments, broad cul- 
ture and professional training are prime essentials in the character 
of the accomplished instructor ;-but there is another element that 
must be conjoined with these to secure complete success, This -is 
the power to. understand the minds and hearts of children, so as to 
easily command their respect and sympathy. Some appear as hav— 
ing been endowed by nature with this kind of magnetism, but the 
great majority, possessed of it, have acquired it by emulating high 
models of excellence, practicing patient self-control, and carefully 
studying the laws of mind. They are an invaluable acquisition to 
any system with which they may beeome connected, and every rea- 
sonable condition should be complied with to retain them in services 
It has been the policy of your Board and. of your predecessors in 
office from the first to extend every encouragement to such, and to 
those aspiring to reach the same standard of excellence.

COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS: REPORTS, 
BEDFORD COUNTY: 
‘Wa. H. Wuiresipr, SUPERINTENDENT, Shelbyville. “ 
In making this, my second annual report, I have no very marked 
changes to make on last year’s report. Our school work has moved 
smoothly on, showing a gradual and healthy increase of enroll- 
ment and average attendance. One thing which I note with 
pleasure, is the growing sentiment or determination on the part of 
the people to henceforth elect none but the best men for directors. 
Allow me to suggest, that if the time of making the reports was 
changed or made to run with the common year, and the right to 
approve all warrants for school money restored to the Superinten- 
dent, I think our reports could be gotten up more promptly und 
correetly. 
. TEACHERS. 
‘The teachers of this county deserve much credit for the interest 
and energy displayed in their work, many of them spending their 
means and leisure time in attending the best Normal Schools in the 
country, and otherwise. fitting themselves for successful work in the 
school room, and the result is that our schools are keeping pace 
with the best in the State. 
HOUSES, FURNITURE, ETC. 
Since my last report there have been finished up, five very neat: : 
‘and comfortably houses, two of these costing about $1,000 each,
-P-A-G-E-110
(a0 y 
the other three about $500 each ; and at this writing the subject of 
consolidating schools and erecting good. houses is being agitated: in 
two of our most backward districts. 
INSTITUTE, 
We had this year a three days institute, conducted on the plan of. 
general class work. The average attendance of teachers was good, 
and-the interest manifested in the work by all present, was very 
gratifying; indeed, I think it is conceded by all teachers who were 
present, that as to average attendance, interest taken and general 
utility of the work, it was one of the most successful institutes ever 
held in our county. . ‘ 
VISITS. 
I have visited about all the schools in the county this fall, ‘mak- 
ing it a rule to visit two schools a day, thereby giving myself time 
. to see a good deal of the school work, and I find the schools almost 
without exception doing well where the teachérs have been selected 
with sole regard to their capacity to teach well, but in some instan-. 
ces, where the teacher has been selected through personal favoritism, 
the school languishes. 
_ FINANCES, 
There has been no material change in our financial condition 
since my last report. Generally the directors have‘ managed the 
school fund of their respective districts judiciously, with this ex- 
ception, that they probably do not grade the salaries of teachers 
with enough regard to their qualifications to teach. I will close 
this report with the observation that the one great need of our pub- 
lic ‘school system is more money, that the length of time may bee 
made longer. 
. BENTON COUNTY. 
DJ; ALLEN, SUPERINTENDENT, Camden... 
In compliance with the school law, I hérewith transmit my an= 
nual report of the Benton county schools for the year ending June 
30, 1884, which I think is correct. I see from your last annual ~ 
_ Teport quite a number of Superintendents only make a partial ¥e~ *

(111) 7 ° - 
port on‘account, they say, of directors not reporting to them. This 
is my fourth annual report, and I have never been many days late 
in- getting my report complete. My plan is to deliver the blanks in 
person and explain the necessity of having all-reports in due time, 
and then if they do not come up, I go after them and helpthem make — 
them out, if necessary. I think it was a bad move when the Leg- 
islature repealed the Jaw in regard to having the Superintendent to . 
approve all warrants. When he had this power, and having the 
amount due each district, he could always tell how long the schools. 
were taught, and prevent many violations ef the school law. Lalso : 
think that we should have money sufficient set: apart by the State 
for a five months’ school, for a school for a shorter term isnot of — . 
much acount. I try to visit all my schools and give them encour 
agement, and confer with the teachers and district directors in re- 
gard to the promotion of the school interest. I have also endeav- — 
ered to keep up a regular teachers’ institute for the benefit of the - 
teachers, and through them for the benefit of the patrons, and we_ 
haye some teachers who take some interest in these meetings. I 
try to convert them into a training school, and have exhibited the 
best methods of imparting instruction in ‘the branches required to 
be taught by the school law, and have other matters discussed in re- 
gard to school government, ete. But while we have some good.” 
teachers, there are also fogies in the school room as well as in other 
_ places. I notice during my visits to the schools, that those who 
attend the institute, take school journals and read books on theory 
and practice, are teaching school, while those who do not, are only 
keeping school. If we had enough who were qualified, I would be 
- in-favor of the school keepers following some other avocation, for 
I verily believe they do more harm to the cause of schools than any 
other class of persons. I think there should be more legislation in 
regard to giving inducements to our Normal Schools at home, as I 
believe good teaching will do more to bring our schools in favor 
- with the people than anything else. 
Although the additional tax was voted down here this year, I . 
believe yet it is growing in favor with the people, as there were more 
votes cast for it than ever before. I still hope, trust and pray that 
it will not be long until all will pladly receive the benefits of a free 
-edueation—the rich and the poor alike.

Pardon my delay. Our Trustee has been sick and could not make 
his report to me earlier. Our schools are doing better this year in 
some parts of the county. The greatest trouble here is, so many do 
not send to school. Some send none at all, while others send so ir- 
regularly that their children do no good in school. I believe in 
some instances a compulsory ‘school law would be of great profit. I 
also think the law should’be changed so that County Superintendents 
should approve all school orders so that the receipts and expend- 
_ itures could be kept by his book alone. — 
BLOUNT COUNTY. 
A. M. Games, SuPpERINTENDENT, Maryville. 
Our common schools are growing in interest with the masses. 
‘Most of our directors are taking more than usual interest in their 
work, but some of them seem to think the longest schools are the: 
best, consequently cheap teachers are in demand. 
Our teachers generally are alive to their work. Many of them g are 
young with but little experience. Some of them are not yet con< 
vinced that there is any knowledge necessary for successful teach- 
ing, save a knowledge of text books, 
_I have endeavored to introduce such educational works as I 
thought they should read, and with some success. 
I have held seven teachers’ institutes, which were well attended 
_and a lively interest taken in them by patron and teacher. I have 
visited fifty-two schools, to most of which I delivered addresses of 
encouragement ; and at several places, by appointment, addressed. 
- the patrons, all of which were well received. 
It would be well if our law. could be so amended, that the ma- 
_terial for the report of the County Superintendent may be forth-- 
- coming, or a penalty attached. The directors might be paid for 
their work. Thus we would. be more likely to have efficient boards. 
I would suggest that you recommend to our Legislature, that Physi- 
ology and Hygiene be substituted in our common schools for Geol- 
ogy, and Civil Government for Elementary Agriculture.

BRADLEY COUNTY. 
| J. N. VARNELL, SUPERINTENDENT, Cleveland. 
This report is much behind time, on account of a failure of direc- 
tors and teachers in furnishing their reports to me. - It-is imposei- 
ble to get statistics absolutely correct from so many different sources ; 
-: especially under the present leniency of the school ‘law. 
My figares in reference to the finances and scholastic population’ , 
‘are correct, while all the rest are only approximately true. I think 
~ our schools are doing better work than in any former year. During 
the present session I have visited nearly all the schools under my 
supervision. I am of the opinion that our first and greatest need 
is more funds to run our schools a longer term; another serious 
obstacle to their progress is the want of comfortable houses, conve- 
niently arranged for school. purposes. In many districts the houses 
are so open as scarcely to furnish protection from the rude blasts 
of winter. I have agitated this subject both publicly and privately, 
and I trust some improvement will be made in this direction. 
It seems that our people are rather slow to believe that good 
-schoole cannot flourish in rude houses, and the one.is a necessary 
adjunct, to the other. : 
The bad location of school sites is another difficulty almost as 
great as the preceding. In not a few districts there are three or four 
schools where one or two would be sufficient, if placed at central 
points.. I am at a loss to know what to do in such cases. Even if the 
directors are willing to rearrange the houses, the people are obsti- 
nate and bitterly opposed to a change. These are some of the 
disadyantages under which the teachers of the county are laboring.. 
Is it to. be wondered at, then, if their progress is very slow? With 
an earnest, active corps of teachers to aid me in my efforts at ad- 
vancement, I am confident that much will be done to obviate these

FINANCIAL. 
Our financial condition is good; our directors do not allow our~ 
schools to run in debt; our public school fund grows gradually. 
Our respected County Court’ believes that the 8,000 scholars we 
have will soon be the citizens of our county, and they.are determined. 
to give them a chance to educate themselves. They have not done 
any other one thing so important and beneficial to our county. The 
children will rise up some day and call them blessed. / 
Our excellent Trustee attends to his business promptly. Some of 
~ our directors have been imposed upon by map agents, who sold . 
to them maps at an exorbitant price, drew the money and have not 
as yet furnished the maps. The apportionment last winter was $1. 50 
to each pupil. 
PROGRESS. ° 
Onur improvement for the last year is very perceptible and laud- 
able. First, our honorable County Court has increased the school tax 
on property .023 per cent. Wages for good teachers have increased 
$2.50 per month. The teachers ave improved considerably on 
the curriculum. Not a single second grade certificate has been allow- 
ed since May, 1884. All the teachers now pass on Geology and 
Elements of Agriculture; though at our first institute in April, © 
1883, a resolution was passed by forty of the best teachers in the 
county to petition you to allow me to waive geology in my examina- 
tions. Last year there were twenty-five or thirty schools without 
blackboards ; there are not now over six or seven, and the directors 
faithfully promise tohave them by next term. The six thousand year 
“old bench’has given place to the new comfortable desk, in several 
of. our schools; new houses have been erected and old ones 
improved. Our examinations are impartial and more thorough. 
We hold them at the county seat two weeks before the school term, 
and make them both oral and written, and examine each applicant 
from one to three days. No duplicating of certificatees is allowed. 
‘ Tt means a non-performance of duty on both the Superintendent 
and teacher; it means partiality, and lowers educational interest and 
deters raising scholarship. Double the number of school journals 
- and books on education are now being read by our teachers and many 
have supplied themselves with apparatus. Our institutes meet at 
the appointed time, ¢ the white three times a year, and the colored :

SCHOOLS. 
- Our district public schools are doing an excellent work for the _ 
students of the county, but the terms are too short. Some of them, 
where there is a lage number belonging to a house, have a school 
two months in the summer and three months in the winter; but a 
large majority do not have but one school—from six to ten weeks— 
each: year. 
HIGH SCHQOLS,. 
- We have not had.so many high schools this year as last, though 
the interest is good; I presume they are resting for next year. 
McKenzie, Bethel College, McTyeire Institute and the Public 
High School, have all continued in session ten months, Hunting- 
don tén months, Trezevant eight months, and Ashwood eight 
months,

COCKE COUNTY. =. 
Rorvs L. Hickey, SUPERINTENDENT, Newport,’ 
I send you to-day my second annual report of the public schools -- 
of Cocke County, and I must say again that I cannot make a cor-* 
reet report as respects everything required to be reported by the law.' ©    
It is almost -impossible to get teachers to report everything by the « ‘ 
proper time. I have received, up to the date of this report, about a 
one-half the abstracts that should have been returned to me ;.conse- 
quently, all abstracts that come to me after making this report will -- 
_be of.no special benefit or aid to me; for I consider that the intention 
of the law was for all abstracts to be returned to the County Super- 
intendent.on or before the 15th of September, and they were to be 
ased by the County Superintendent in making his report to the 
State Superintendent. I have also received reports only from three 
“directors, giving value of school property in their districts, etc. I 
will approximate the school property as nearly as possible. . 
You will'see from my report that our schools have been attended 
more regularly this year than last. That is, we have had a better 
‘daily attendance, which is very encouraging to all supporters of 
public schools .in Cocke County. I have visited, so far, sixty schools, 
and I find them generally in good condition. Our teachers are ~ 
thoroughly awake to theirgduty, and are doing everything to ad-- 
vance the educational interests of the county. I see that our school- 
rooms are furnished with blackboards, desks, etc., much better than 
they were last year. 
Taking everything into consideration, I think. we are advancing, 
slowly but steadily. 
- T’have mate it a point to examine , thé different classes in the 
achool-rooms, and get the method of the teachers, to know whether 
they have been instructing their schools properly or not, and if a 
teacher, has not, I have. never failed to tell him privately of his 
errors,

COFFEE COUNTY. 
C. N. TownsEnp, SUPERINTENDENT, Hillsboro. 
The public schools of this county for the past year, with few 
exceptions, have. been very prosperous; most of our schools are ~ 
Normal in methods, and are excellent. The standard of schools. 
and’ the educational interest of the county have been elevated con-— 
siderably by the work done in teachers’ institutes, and by the 
* closer observance of the instructions in licensing teachers. Regular 
monthly institutes were held at Manchester, and weekly ones were, 
held at other points in the county, during the sessions of the schools, 
which were well attended by the ablest. and most successful teach - 
ers. The- teachers feel the great importance of their work, and’ 
are laboring earnestly to advance the cause of education. The peo- 
_ ple also have been more watchful of their educational interest than 
ever before, and, by reason of this, have aided materially in push- 
ing forward and ‘puilding up the educational interest of our county. 
I believe public sentiment is savorable to and satisfied with the 
work of our schools. I-have visited the schools in every district, 
and found most of them well attended which had competent — 
_ teachers. I bélieve the teachers discharged their duty as such in a 
faithful manner, notwithstanding the small wages recived for same_. “ 
While I believe our schools are much better than heretofore, and — 
will compare favorably with most of those in the State, yet there ix 
much to do to bring.them np to that standard of excellence whiok 
is due to the intelligence and. public spirit ‘and educational: enter- 
prise of the people.- Our schools cannot ‘be elevated Properly

looking to.the collecting of more accurate statistics in the future, 
and that is, that officers and teachers be not allowed to draw full 
pay for their services until full and accurate reports have been filed

ance, deportment, scholarship, enrollment, improvemelit in school 
buildings, and the increase of popular appreciation, the record of 
the year is brighter than any that has preceded it in the history of — 
~ our schools. Our scholastic population has increased 1,436 for 
1884-5, the enrollment 1,080, and daily attendance 1,006, since my 
last report, which shows very plainly that there is a deep interest 
felt by all. In visiting our schools I have found more patrons look- 
ing after the pupils than ever before. It is true,a large majority of. 
them never visit the schools. * 
The greater number of our directors ‘are securing the services of 
only first-class teachers, and are paying them a salary sufficient to 
enable them to do efficient work. Too much cannot be said of our 
directors and teachers as a body. It is a lamentable fact, however, 
that a few of our directors have thrown aside their legal rights, and 
let the people elect the teacher, This has caused more dissension 
than any one thing; but: suffice it to say, this plan is never repeated- 
‘We have run our schools on an average of eight and one-half 
months; paid the teachers at the end of the month in every district. 
save one. In addition to this we have built four elegant brick” 
houses, five beautiful frame ones and one comfortable log house, and - 
furnished them and many others with the improved desks and seats,’ 
A word for our teachers: It is true we have lost a few of our 
. best teachers, but their places have been supplied by teachers edu- ~ 
-eated in our own schools and those in and adjacent to Nashville. A 
lack of true-discipline is one of the leading obstacles in the way of 
some of our teachers. It is simply this: they are afraid of that ~ 
‘which they know to be daty. A great many of our teaghers are 
ladies and gentlemen of culture and rare talents, whose labors do not 
close with the day, month or year, but whose work is life-long. They * 
are erecting monuments.in this land of ours and in the dear chil- 
dren’s hearts— + os 
. That will resist the empire of decay . 
.. When time is o’er and worlds have passed away; ae 
Cold in the dust the cherished heart may lie, . 
But that. which warnied it once will never die.”

"Whilst I have not realized during the last scholastic year all that 
TI hoped for and expected, I should, I suppyse, to a great degree, be 
satisfied with the progress and results of the public schools in my 
county. Our County Court, at its last January term, levied a tax 
_ of twenty cents on the hundred dollars’ worth of property, and a tax 
on all privileges, for public school purposes. This greatly increased 
our school fund, and has enabled us to have upon an average about 
six months’ schools throughout the county. My method of testing 
the qualification of applicants to teach was by public examination, 
in which I was assisted by Professors Dodson and Kelley, ot Pure 
Fountain College. I find this method of obtaining teachers to be 
very satisfactory. It gives every one a fair and equal opportunity 
to try for a certificate, and has the beneficent effect of satisfying the 
public mind as to the qualification of the teacher. \

with all the remainder of the management of the public school system. 
It often happens that very improper men are elected to that office, 
who are governed by selfish motives, for themselves individually, 
‘relatives or friends.: In this connection I wish again to call atten- 
tion to a great defect in our school law, and a very great blunder, 
in my judgment, made by our Legislature in repealing that part of 
the law requiring the County Superintendent to approve all warrants” 
before they are paid off by the trustee. The law as it now stands 
leaves the management of the -financial part of the school system 
almost ‘exclusively to men who very often are wholly incapable of 
inch’ pitemagement. I would, therefore, suggest and recommend that

_ Our teachers have performed good and efficient work, and have, in 
‘nearly every instance, given ample satisfation both to patrons and

On account of sickness‘in my family, it was impossible for me to 
visit’all the schools. As you are aware, our county. is very large, 
and it. would take at Jeast three months to canvass it closely. Our. 
‘board of directors is composed of the best men in the districts, and 
with but one exception they have been very prompt in the discharge - 
of their duties. 
In June I, with the assistance of Professor Liston, held a colored” 
teachers’ institute, as the result of which was formed a teachers’ 
-association, to meet every two months at different places in the 
county. Every one seemed to be delighted, and insist that we have- 
one next year of two weeks’ duration at least. 
We have just adopted a uniform series of text-books throughout 
the county, which is another move in ‘the right direction. My aim

long since. This is a large county, with a large-number of schools. . 
and school officers, and about the only question which gives me any 
- trouble now is getting accurate data for my reports. It has‘ cost me- 
- much time, mach labor and much friction of patience, but it is now’ | 
complete, aod I can with pride refer to the showing. TI desire to- 
-eall your attention to a few points in the report: ~— ok 
The number enrolled is not as large as usual. This does not arise- 
from, a -want of interest, but from the fact that in these districts there- 
were no schools during the year. The actual per cent. of enrollmént. 
is greater than ever, 
The amount of money expended for teaching is Jess, while the- 
average price paid teachers is greater. This alyo occurs from the- 
same cause; that is, the amount of money expended does, but the 
average price paid teachers would most likely have increased if these- 
- districts had had schools. 
To my mind, this is a most encouraging feature, for I do believe 
that our schoo) system will never be what it should until such prices. 
are paid for trained teachers as will obtain them in our tural schools. 
You will note that fewer school-houses have been erected during 
the-year. This occurs from the gratifying fact that in most of the: 
districts there are now good, substantial frame houses; and in many — 
places they are painted white, and even have green Blinds. 
Oar schools are a source of pride to our citizens, dud in every 
part of the county the greatest interest:is manifested, and there is a 
generous rivalry to excel. oe ; 
This closes my connection with the schools of Gibson county. I 
have had control for nearly six years. During this time I have seen 
the school tax raised from fifteen cents to thirty cents, and at the 
next term of the County Court will see it put at thirty-five cents. I. 
have seen the school population increase over two thousand. During 
this time I have been in almost every school-house in the county, 
time and time again, and know the country roads as well, almost, as 
do the residents. of the neighborhood. I have licensed nearly a 
thousand teachers. I have seen erected over fifty school-houses, 
and have seen nearly two hundred thousand dollars expended in the 
cause of education. I have tried in-every way to carry out the spirit 
of the e law, and while I have had considerable success, and with pridg.

We now have nine colleges, academies and seminaries in the 
county; in seven of these consolidated schools were taught with an 
aggregate enrollment of 1,280 pupils. A few years ago many of 
our people opposed the establishment of the higher or consolidated 
‘schools, believing that the numbers drawn to them would weaken 
the common schools so much as to render them of little value. 
_ However, I gave them all the encouragement in my power, and the 
wisdom of the course is apparent in the decided increase in the en- 
rollment in the common, sehools. And I believe with intelli- — 
gently directed energies in the County Superintendent, that in five 
years we could have a greaded school in each dislrict in the county ; 
and as the benefits from these become more apparent, not many 
‘years will elapse before none but graded schools would be taught in 
all the-houses.

Enclosed you will find-my second annnal report of the Schools 
for Hamblen county. 
There has been considerable improvement in the school work 
inthis county. The teachers are conscientious gentlemen and ladies, 
and are doing good work. “The ditly drawback is the lack of money.. 
If Congress would pass the “Blair Educational Bill” it would help- 
us greatly. 
There is great need of alaw to compel teachers and directors to- 
make their reports. Not more than one-half of them will report 
at the proper time; and some will not report at all. There is no- 
reason why the Legislature should not pass a law ‘that would. com— 
pel them to do their duty. oe a _ 
HAMILTON COUNTY. 
_ H.B. Heywoon, SUPERINTENDENT, Chattanooga. 
The public schools of Hamilton county “made reasonable progress. 
during the year ending June 30, 1884. The enrollment was quite. 
as large as usual, while there was considerable increase in the aver> 
“age attendance, it being forty-five per cent. of the scholastic popula 
- tion in all sub-sections having a school term. 
. The volume of influence hitherto operating in favor of the State 
system, and moderately active, is marshaling itself to a more gener 
ous support of the public schools, while it is receiving valued acces- 
‘sions from time to time. Doubt and halting are rapidly giving way” 
to investigation and active support. 
Our school ‘term is too short. If fifty per cent. could be added. 
to its duration, a unit of this addition would be worth two Pree : 
ing it. 
A series of grades was prepared after the close of the term; 0 
in accordance therewith the schools are graded during the curr. 
_ term, 1884-5. ‘This work has merit in several directions, wh Q 
oo is scarcely necessary to point out. Without it, we drift somew! 
"The 1 following suggestions are respeotfally made: :    
      
        
  ay
-P-A-G-E-129
( 129 ) 
Ist. A change in the law so as to require reports from the direc- 
tors to be rendered July 15, instead of September 15; as the school 
year closes two months earlier than.it did when September 15 was 
- designated as the limit. 
' 2d, A change in the regulations so as to require. teachers to send | 
abstracts directly to the Superintendent at close of term. As this 
report is made to and for him there seems no good reason why 
-it should not go directly to him. It is believed that the practice 
: will secure a more prompt completion of his consolidated report. 
3d. That abstracts be so modified as to show total number of 
days present and total number of days absent. 
Ath. That provision be made for granting three-year certificates 
to teachers making an average of from 90 to 100 in each of two 
successive examinations. 
5th. That private or single examinations be abolished, except in 
-ease of applicants who are non-residents of the State, or are pre* 
vented by sickness from attending normal or regular appointment. - 
There are other subjects, did space permit more than their mere 
mention, to which the attention of the authorities having the power 
to act might well be called ; as whether a county board of education 
might be of service; said board being clothed with power to settle. 
the question of uniformity in text-books, and to arrange other stated 
matters. Questions touching school districts on county lines, the 
districts consisting of parts of each county, might be definitely set- 
tled. These and other topics present some questions that are, 
theoretically, full of interest. 
There stood upon the statute books a law requiring Superinten- - 
dents to approve warrants. This has been repealed. It is barely 
probable that a diligent discharge of the duties involved under such 
a provision of law might, to some extent, be inconsistent with the 
fall exercise of the true functions of the office. His work bears 
upon the schools, their tone and efficiency, and upon the advance- 
ment of the children of his county in the several branches of learn- 
ing, and if the Superintendent fails here, he fails absolutely. No 
considerable obstacle should be interposed to the full play of such 
ability as he may possess in this direction. 
The prosperity of a State depends somewhat on ‘the quality of its 
school system. It is to be hoped that the character of our public 
schools may soon be such as to demonstrate to our citizens the high

  oe (481) 
From the statistical reports it will be seen that the free schools of 
this county are in a better condition than they have been since the 
establishment of the system. Since my election to-this office I have 
. worked to create a better feeling towards the public schools, and I 
think, to a certain extent, I havesucceeded. There is more interest 
now taken in education in this county than I ever knew before. 
We are free from school debt, with a handsome balance in the 
treasury of $5,009.66. 
. ‘I think it should be the duty of the County Superintendent to - 
. approve the warrants before they are paid, for two reasons; first, it 
is utterly impossible to get the teachers to report.as the law now 
stands; second, the funds ought to be better guarded. : 
The public school system has but little opposition in ‘this county. 
  
HARDIN COUNTY. : 
Joun T. Damron, SUPERINTENDENT, Savannah. 
In submitting this, my fourth annual report, it gives me pleasure 
to state’ that our public schools in old Hardin received a perfect 
boom in January last by the County Court increasing the school tax 
from twenty cents to thirty-five cents, and I am satisfied that 
the present rate will not be decreased, but rather increased. 
The gradual increase of interest taken on the part of our people 
is manifest. We must now have teachers of better qualifications, 
better school houses, and work up our directors, 60 that they will 
brighten up and keep everything in order. 
The County Superintendent’s salary should be regulated by the 
Legislature. They should approve all school warrants before paid 
by the trustee. Each civil district should have one board of 
directors: 
We would be proud to have Superintendent Paine as State 
Superintendent two years longer.

able to make it somewhat more complete and reliable than I could 
do a year since. 
With very few exceptions I visited all of my schdols at least once 
and some oftener. I found the majority of them in as good condi- 
tion as could reasonably be expected under the circumstances. 
_ ‘We sadly need more money and better houses. . With regard to 
the latter we are, however, improving, a few good, suitable houses 
being erected every year. 
Our directors, in the month of July, adopted a series of text-booke, 
or rather, in part, renewed an adoption formerly existing, and pro- 
posethat said renewal or re-adoption be continued for five years ; 
hoping to gradually secure uniformity, or a greater degree of the- 
same than now exists.

“We are making some Progress in. the work of public schools; the 
dissatisfaction of previous years: has nearly passed away, and the 
people are learning the value of free schools. 
The delay of the report was caused by the school directors and 
teachers not’ making their reports of schools, as is required of 
‘them by law. The directors and teachers of my county have . 
been very dilatory in sending in their reports. The law should be 
more strict in this respect.. - . 
' ‘Non-attendance and irregular attendance are great drawbacks to 
our free schools. I am in favor of a compulsory school law... This 
alone will educate all our children in the State. 
I am also in favor of our Legislature passing a law adopting a 
uniform system of text-books for five or more years. This*for a 
while might work a hardship, but in the end would be greatly, to 
the interest of education. 
I believe that the law should compel every teacher in the public 
‘schools to attend as many as-two institutes during each Year. 
Teachers in my county cannot be induced to attend.

make it. t 
_ County Superintendents’ salaries should be regulated by the Leg- 
islature.. There is no uniformity in their salaries. Some receive 
sixty dollars and others $1,200 per year, or more.’ I think the 
Legislature ought to regulate the salaries according to the scholas- 
tic population and number of schools in the county, and require 
. the Superintendent to visit all the schools.’ Say two cents for every 
child enumerated ; two dollars for every school visited, and one 
dollar for every applicant examined or somet hing,.according to the 
work performed. 
The Legislature ought to regulate by law the minimum number. 
of children to constitute a legal school district. In parts of this 
‘county the interest is very materially damaged by very small dis- 
tricts. My experience is that no school district ought to have less 
than sixty children in it, and that no school ought to be allowed 
. to continue in operation when the daily average attendance falls 
below one-third of the resideut nnmber of children; for it costs 
. a6 much to have ten children taught as it does forty. 
Have the Legislature to enact a law that will give the Superinten- 
dent well defined authority, and require of him the performance of | 
specific duties. > 
Let the Legislature pass a law to have all the public schools in 
a county taught the same number ot days.

many addresses, and have ridden two thousand miles during the 
past scholastic year. : 
Our County Court promptly levied the school tax. It is now 
thirty cents on the one hundred dollars’ worth of property. 
‘In conclusion, I would say that I have discharged my duties the 
very I best could, regardless of the small salary allowed me by 
the County Court. My report has been made from actual personal 
effort in visiting the schools, and can be relied upon.. I trust it 
may give entire satisfaction.

our schools are a success. . 
HUMPHREYS COUNTY. 
FF. McQuam, SUPERINTENDENT, MeEwen. 
My report is incomplete, and I have been delayed in making it on 
account of the indifference of directors in reporting to me. There 
are four districts that failed to report, and three furnished only in-_ 
‘ eomplete reports. This, I presume, has been caused more from neg 
lect than from the indifference of the directors. 
The people of this county are much interested in schools and the 
education: of their children; so that when the short term of. our 
public schools has expired, and a neighborhood or village school’ 
has offered educational facilities, parents bring their children, as if 
ever anxious to receive the benefits of an education. 
We have some very good school-houses in this county, but in 
many instances they lack the furniture necessary to aid the teacher’ 
in imparting instruction. Some houses have no blackboards, and: 
mostly all are without maps and globes. 
The teachers are active workers, who have qualified themselves 
* for the noble work of imparting instruction, and though their pay 
is small, yet they work with a will not surpassed by the best paid 
‘professors. 
County Superintendents have no way of ‘compelling teachers. te. 
furnish their abstracts, since the Legislature repealed the law whi 3

required school warrants to be signed by the County Superinten- 
dents before being paid by the trustee. By that means the County 
Superintendent had it in his power to collect those statistics neces- 
sary to make his report. I hope our next Legislature will consider 
this, and also the necessity of blank warrants in book form with 
stub attached. The amount paid each teacher or district can be 
placed on this stub, and by this means the County Superintendent 
will know the amount paid each district in his county by the trus- 
tee—said books to be furnished to County Superintendents, so that 
all school warrants must be issued by him.

some of the clerks of the districts. I bad to attend in person to get- 
ting some of the statistics required. 
I have visited all the schools but two, some twice and some three 
times. I am glad to report that we have had a more competent 
corps of teachers the past year than usual, and the fruits are clearly 
visible from the fact that the pupils have made greater progress, 
besides better attendance. The patrons are growing more-and more 
in favor of the public school system. They have become convinced 
that it is the only means by which the masses.can be educated. The, 
people are beginning to see that it is much better to educate the 
masses, thereby enabling them to develop the great resources of the 
country, making them self-sustaining, intelligent and good citizens, 
instead of supporting them as paupers and inmates of the prisons. 
In this county we have but eight (8) paupers, at an annual cost of © 
$600, all perfectly illiterate, which, at our present rate of tuition, 
would pay the tuition of !30 pupils ten months out of every year.

sible to get reports from school officers and teachers. I could get 
no report from the county trustee. Have never been able to get 
reports from the county trustees, ; : as 
Our’ schools did very well last winter. The most of the schools 
for this year have opened. The outlook is very promising. The 
corps of teachers is good. Our graded or high schools promise-to 
do well. They have a good attendance. Our school at this place 
is under the supervision of Rev. S. G. Ketron, a graduate of Athens 
College. 
Onr school fund is not as large as Tast year, but I think there i is 
“a disposition to supplement it in some districts. 
The interest in education is gradually growing. Our. high 
schools are turning out a number of good teachers, Prof. Ketron 
thinks of giving special instruction to those who are preparing to 
teach, which I think will be an excellent thing. I have been keep- 
ing up’a column in our county paper on educational tatters, which 
I think has had a.good influence. 
Taking all things together, our schools have been a success, and 
still promise to be in the future. We cannot afford to neglect this 
great interest. We must educate, no matter what the cost may be.

In my last report, I stated that the’ second district of Knox 
county was working under a graded system. The directors, teach- 
ers, pupils and parents were, highly pleased with the change. At a 
meeting of the directors of our county, held last May, the subject 
of grading all the schools of Knox county was presented, and, after 
remarks from a numberof the directors, a vote was taken, and it 
was unanimously carried to grade the schools of our county. A 
committee was appointed to prepare a course of study and rules for 
the government of the public schools of Knox county, and to pre~ 
sent the same to the different district boards for their approval. 
_The committee did as directed, and we-had their report printed and 
- supplied each family of the county with a copy of the same. Hav- 
ing done this before the schools opened, we had but little troyble in 
getting the most of our schools to adopt it. We are highly pleased 
with it, as it gives ua systematic work. : 
The ‘State Normal at Knoxville did much in the way of prepar-- 
ing our teachers for more efficient work. A majority of our.teach- 
_ ers.attended said Normal and were well pleased with the plan by. 
which it was conducted. Prof. Dinwiddie seems to be the right 
man in the right place.

You will doubtless notice that the enrollment and average attend- 
ance for this year are not as great as they were last year. There are 
several reasons for this; the most prominent is that last year some 
of the districts spent the whole of their income, and two of them 
went in debt. The past year they have been more cautious, and 
have had but few schools opened in them, yet, I must confess, 
that there is not that strong feeling among the people as that which 
animated them twelve months ago. The people wish and demand 
that the money paid by them shall be faithfully accounted for, and 
unless this is done their affection for and interest in our school system 
. will decrease year by year. Therefore, I again earnestly call .your 
attention to the necessity of an amendment of the school law by 
the next Legislature. As the law now stands, the school fund is 
in.a state of “orphanage”. Orphans generally are plundered by 
sharpers.. No one is now authorized to call defaulters to an account. 
Even if the suggestions made in my last report are adopted, there 
ought to be authority given by law to some one, and it ought to. be 
made his duty to examine into the condition of the school fund of 
each county in the State, and where a defaulter is found | require suit 
to be brought. .

  In making to you this my second, and perhaps last, annual report. 
it is my earnest wish to embrace in it only that which seems to me 
of' real importance; but if I say too much I know you will excu 
me. 
In visiting the schools of this county, both last year and this, I 
have carefully noted the progress and the general condition and! 
management of our public schools, and after a critical review o 
facts, I am prepared to say that the schools, as a general thing, are 
progressing fairly, considering the disadvantages under which many 
of them are colmpelled to labor. I find several very serious obstacles 
in the way, which must be removed before our schools can accom- 
plish the desired results. Among these 1 may mention the follow- 
ing as most prominent: 
Many of our young teachers lack that important element so neces- 
sary to successful school work, to wit: practical experience in the 
management of the school. It is impossible to ‘secure experienced 
teachers for all the schools, and I cannot see but one way to supply 
the deficiency. If the Legislature would establish a normal schoolt 
in each county every year, for one month, or even less, and require’ 
every teacher in charge of public schools to attend one or more ses= 
sions, or forfeit their certificates and positions, we would sdon hear 
no more cry of “wasted money!” The cost of such a school would 
' be very little, compared with the vast sums wasted upon inexperi- - 
enced teachers. . - 
The next obstacle in the way is the lack of suitable houses and 
- apparatus, so necessary to sure and rapid progress. This year I 
have visited nearly every school in the county, and I may safely 
say that fully one-half of the school-houses are totally unfit to teach 
any but a short summer term in. The people will not build com- 
- fortable school-houses at their own expense, only occasionally ; and 
the public-school fund is not sufficient to build houses and support: 
echools at the same'time. So what must we do to remedy: the evil? 
Another great hindrance to progress is a want of suitable books.” 
No uniformity i in any of the schools! Many of the books-in‘ use ara’ 
of forty years ago.-; People are slow to purchase school books, even: 
when ‘they can obtain them at halt price, and have their schools’ 
 
-P-A-G-E-141
(141) 
well classified. Some schools have a dozen different kindy of arith- 
metic, grammar, geography, etc. What a loss of time in teaching, . 
and therefore waste of money to the people! Yet, how can we help 
it? “Will not.our Legislature take it in hand and adopta uniform set - 
of school text-books for the entire State, say for eight or. ten years? 
Thie, I am certain, would be one of the very best things to facili- 
tate the labor of the teacher, and add to the future prosperity of 
~ our school system, : 
‘One other very serious drawback, and perhaps the most danger- . 
‘ous one, is non-atiendance. The people have, heretofore, complained 
that the school term was too short to accomplish any material good, 
and many of them have kept their children from the school on that 
- exeuse. To remedy this defect our County Court promptly levied a 
sufficient tax last January to extend the term to nearly five months, 
thinking thereby to secure a larger attendance in schools. But, lo! 
the attendance this year is little better than last! Now this is the 
point which I think ought to engage the profound attention of every 
member of our State Legislature. A law should be speedily enacted 
to. compel parenis and guardians to send their children to the 
schools. They are forced, by law, to pay taxes for the support of 
public schools, and why should not the same power and authority 
be exercised in bringing the children of the country into the school- 
room to receive the instruction so necessary in preparing them for . 
the great duties of life? Several schools in this county closed this 
year in about one month after opening. Lack of attendance, through 
contrary parents, was the sole cause. Now a compulsory law would 
certainly remedy such evils, and confer upon the child what is justly 
due it—a reasonable education. . 
I wish every child in our beloved country a liberal education; 
' every worker in the great cause a brilliant and successful career, 
and that Hon. Thos. H. Paine may Jong remain our State Superin- 
tendent. / :

in the schools of our county. -

in every detail. I have spared no pains on it, and you may rely 
on the result. 
- Kou will see some improvement on last year in every respect. 
District clerks have been very careful in numbering the children, 
hence the increase of population. The teachers have taken much 
more pains with their abstracts, hence the increase of enrollment 
- and daily attendance. Another grand reason for the improve- 
ment is, that the people have manifested more than usual interest 
‘in the schools, and teachers generally report the attendance more 
regular. 
But I think matters are far from satisfactory yet. Only sixty-six 
children in every hundred attend school at all, thirty-four never sée 
inside the school-room, and only fifty in the hundred are regular 
attendants. The alleged cause of this is poverty ; the real cause is 
indifterence on the part of parents. Generally the class that is not 
able to buy books and clothes for the children can afford to smoke; 
chew and drink, and lounge most extravagantly. In July and 
August the children cannot be spared from home to attend school ; 
in October, homes, cotton fields, and all are frequently left to attend 
first Mondays and big shows; even the parents are carried along. 
No doubt many children get more education at shows in asingle day 
than-at a whole term at school. Of course, the State pays their 
tuition by and by in prosecutions and pauper fees. I have taken 
hours to discuss these things with the thoughtful tax-payers of our 
county. The remedy is compulsory attendance. 
Prof. W. R. Morris, of the Fisk University, conducted our col- 
ored institute last June. The attendance was fine, and his work 
strictly firat-class. He succeeded in arousing our colored teachers 
to a pitch never before attained. They kept up a regular monthly 
institute during the school term. , 
The yearly institutes for white teachers of the county lasted a 
week, our home forces doing the work. ‘They did it, too, to the 
satisfaction and pleasure of the large number of teachers and friends 
present. 
Ono the whole, our schools are doing well comparatively speaking ; 
peace and quiet, zeal and harmony, prevail among the patrons. 
Our teachers are alive and doing their best, and in many instances 
almost insuperable barriers are being surmounted. Nearly every 
teacher in the county takes a live school journal—some two or three.
-P-A-G-E-144
(144)      
       
  Most of them have works on teaching, and thus a live institut 
is constantly in session. The present indications are hopeful; th 
frozen soil is broken ; I trust a better day dawns. The Lord mak 
us faithful and patient in every good work. 
T almost forgot to tell you that in addition to our county insti 
tute, which meets once a month, the teachers of the southeaster: 
portion of our county have, with some of the teachers of Moore an: 
Franklin, organized and successfully conducted another live monthl 
nstitute.. Also, since June, one of our county papers allow 
column per week. Several of our teachers have filled th 
of editor creditably. This move is arousing parents an 
‘readers on the important matters of schools, teachers, hi 
-farniture, as well as educational matters in general. “

We’ still improve in teachers. We have two schools’ in “the . 
county of ten months each, one academic ‘and one private school, 
which are furnishing the county with good teachers. The people ©: 
continue to manifest an interest in schools, more so than ever before. 4B 
Harmony exists in the county in regard toschools with one excep 
tion only, which, seemingly, it is impossible ever to settle. Preju- 
dice-is master in the matter. I think the time for electing school 
directors should be changed from’ our regular county. and’ State 
elections. 
The Legislature ought to enact some law that would’ require 
teachers to attend normal schools or teachers’ institutes. I also. 
think they should say what County Superintendents should receive 
for their services, as our courts do not look at the matter in its 
‘right light. 
_ , Our County Court assessed each teacher for certificate, two ‘dol 
lars ($2.00), which goes to pay me for my services. My salary for 
1883-84 was one hundred and fifty dollars ($150). 
We had a very interesting teachers’ institute last July, at which 
twenty-one teachers were present. It continued four (4) days.

Dixon, vf Allen county, Ky.; Harlin Heeter and Shelton, of Macon

was highly appreciated. Our institute was a grand success. Many 
“questions of vital importance were discussed in the institute. - The 
good people of Fayette extended their hospitalities to the members 
of the institute, and call for another one to be held in Fayette next

In submitting my report for the scholastic year ending June 380, 
1884, I have to say that, while it is imperfect, yet I have spared ng" 
pains to have it as near correct as possible. 
You will observe that the estimated value‘of all: school property. 
is less than last. year. This is caused by, small improvements this 
year, and some property valued last year that did not belong to the 
county. 
I did hope by this time to be able to report money , increased, and 
the schools running at least five months, but we failed. We do not . 
intend to despair, but will kecp it before the people until they hear 
and heed. 
We are satisfied that there is an increased interest in favor of 
common schools, because they are better attended, and by all classes. 
While we have many good men as school directors, yet many of 
them do not take that interest in the work that they should, and 
thus hinder our progress. Better school men might be selected if 
the election of school officers was not appended to other elections, 
and therefore made about a third, fourth or fifth consideration by 
the voters; or, if considered first, only to oe to gain some other 
end. \ 
Teachers’ institutes are in great favor with the people and 
teachers. -We think they are doing some good. Teachers in our | 
private schools give us great assistance. :

do not claim any special merit. 
Tt is with pride I can say, our county has made wonderful progress 
in education in the last three years, the progress has been 'so great, 
it has been commented on by all. When I entered on my official’ 
duties three years ago as Superintendent, our schools were at a 
fearful discount, with a strong and well organized opposition, who 
denounced our free school system openly as a failure, with but 
a few school-houses worthy the name. All of this has been 
changed ; instead of old, dilapidated Tog houses, we have neat 
frame school- houses in nearly every district, with money enough 
for four oy five months school in each district. We might say, 
our schools are on a boom. .All opposition to them, has been 
buried in the great ocean of the past, and they have the confidence 
and earnest support of all classes of our citizens. No other county 
can boast of a more earnest, noble, self-sacrificing and enthusiastic 
corps of teachers than McNairy; and by their untiring zeal and 
devotion to their profession, they have awakened an interest in the - 
cause of free education in this county that has permeated every. 
pore of society. 
Our teachers’ institute has been a powerful engine in the hands: 
of the teachers in arousing the dormant energies of the people, and 
enlisting them in the cause of free education. Our schools were 
very satisfactory this year. We issued more first-class certificates 
than in any previous year. .Our enrollment was larger, and daily 
attendance exceeded any former year, though our report may not 
show it, owing to many teachers failing to hand im their abstracta,

My report has been delayed because of the utter impossibility of 
my getting reports from teachers and directors, and is not made up

I must complain of the inefficiency and carelessness of directors, 
who, in a great many cases will never furnish reports, employ 
teachers at the lowest prices, and in many instances employ them 
without certificates. : 
Again, the low tax of our county prevents any good results being | 
accom plished on account of the short-terms taught. A tax should 
be levied to extend the sessions to at Jeast five months, and then we 
might reasonably expect a great and rapid improvement in our ed- 
ucational interests. 
A believe that a law should be enacted to compel careless parents 
to send their children to school. Many parents are depriving their 
children of the benefits of schools, and permitéing them to grow up 
in ignorance. A law should be enacted forcing such parents to do ~ 
their duty. . Lt

Onr schools are improving. We have a fine school in Byrdstown. 
‘When our schools expired last year the teachers entered at Byrds- 
town Academy, and when they were examined this year I found 
they had made great improvement, and upon visiting the schools I 
- found them much improved. We have better schools now than we 
had in 1883. Our schools are better attended, the pupils are more 
regular, and the patrons are taking more interest in them, and are 
more engaged in education than they were last year. 
We need more and better houses for our schools. We are not 
’ well supplied with text-books, Our county is young, and our citi- 
Zens are heavily burdened with taxes to pay for our public build- 
ings, but as soon as they are able they will turn their attention to 
building houses for their schools. 
We held an institute, which opened on the 2d day of September 
and continued four days. Our teachers, with one exception, all at- 
tended. We had a crowded house, and good order, and our teachers 
were interested and did good work. Professors Capps, Chowning 
and Turner conducted the institute, and were assisted by Professor. 
Jones, from. Kentucky. Our teachers were all alive to the cause of 
education, and the spirit of improvement. If they continue in the 
same spirit ‘till next year we will have good teachers.

The frée school interest in Rhea county is gaining ground évery 
year. Houses are being built, more schools and better teachers, 
increased attendance and longer terms, are some of the well defined, 
evidences of progress. Legislation is needed,and badly needed, 
giving County Superintendents more power over school directors 
_and teachers so that incompetent directors may be made to “step 
down and out,” and teachers be made to conform to directions of 
the county board in regard to text-books.

years that she now stands towards the head of the list, but the friends 
of education within her borders are determined to make her rank 
“still higher. She 7s advancing, 
, Our Normal Institute was a decided success. We have held 
exinual normal institutes for the last six years, and we have thought 
they were all good, but it is universally conceded that our Jast was 
the best we have had. We believe it was conducted. upon the prin- 
ciples of a true normal school. Rev. S. W. Tindell, president of 
Carson College, was with us, and rendered invaluable service. 
My statistical report is, I believe, about correct. I have been 
holding educational meetings at different points throughout the 
county, which have been well attended and a deep interest mani- 
fested. These meetings seem to have a ealutary influence in work- 
ing up the educational ioterest. 
We have in the field a number of live, energetic teachers— 
teachers that are ready to take hold of anything that will enhance 
their efficiency in the school-room. 
We are agitating the subject of graded schools, which, I think, 
will result in the adoption of a system of grades applicable to our 
common schools, and that can be made uniform throughout the 
county. ,

Enclosed find my report for the year ending June 30, 1884. - 
During the year some of the schools in the county were not con- 
ducted for the want of funds, the districts being in debt, and in all 
such cases I advised the directors to first get their districts out of 
debt, as a debt was a great hindrance to the prosperity of their 
schools.

from the reports before me. It has been.a very difficult matter to 
get reports from directors, and in many instances I could not get 
teachers to fill out their abstracts in proper time; and, in fact, did 
not get some of them at all, simply because their last month’s salary — 
was paid off without any questions being asked, and some of them’ 
being citizens of other counties, after the expiration of their term, 
they returned home without making any report whatever. 
Our schools are in good-condition, and are supplied with teachers 
who are perfectly alive to the work. 
We have one high school in this county at Huntsville. 
I have visited nearly all of the schools in this county; but unfor-. 
tunately could not reach all of them up to this time, yet I hope I 
will be able to reach them before the schools terminate. 
This report is incomplete on account of not getting a report from. 
the trustee. I have been wholly unable to get anything whatever 
from him concerning our school expenses. 
SUGGESTIONS. 
Ist. Re-enact the law of 1879, requiring County Superintendents 
to approve school warrants, so it would give him a right to withhold 
his approval-of warrants until the teacher makes his report.’ 
2d. Enact a law that will give the County Superintendent well 
defined authority, and require of him the performance of specific 
duties, and let him have his compensation determined by the actual — 
ime spent in looking after the public interest of his county. 
3d. Let the Legislature levy the school tax on property, polls, ~ 
privileges and litigation. 
4th. Require all public schools taught a certain number of days.

The public schools of this county are surely, though slowly, rising 
in the estimation of the people. Our County Court does not lay © 
a tax large enough to continue our schools a sufficient. length of 
_ time; we need more money and longer terms. : 
Our schools have not been marked by any special prosperity’ 
during the past year, though the outlook is favorable. We have:
-P-A-G-E-158
(158 ) 
   had some good schools, taught by good teachers. The attendance was 
‘ mot as large as it might have been, owing mainly to a general want 
of interest on the-part of those to whom the public schools are givem.: 
T visited most of the schools in the county, and found them 
generally in. good condition, and the people pleased with the : 
progress. The general interest and appreciation of the public sch > 
system has gradually increased for several years, and_the pros 
is good for a continued improvement in the future.

This, alone, is encouraging, and teachers with such an opportunity

While some building and repairs have been in- progress, we still 
have room for more. Our directors have furnished a number of

the whole, we are making slow, but, we hope, sure progress.

especially with the colored race. 
We have a “County Normal Institute,” composed of more than 
fifty energetic, capable teachers, which meets once month’ in

study in elocution and sight singing, besides the regular branches 
taught i in. our schools. We have another association which meets —

The enrollment in the schools in this county Jast year was’ 
not as great as anticipated, oras I had reason to believe it would be.. 
Tt is true, there is an increase in the enrollment of 397-over. that * 
.of last year, and also an increase of 400 in the average attendance: 
-If the people knew just how the greater portion of the school fant 
is obtained, I think this knowledge would increase both the-enroll’ 
ment and average attendance. It is called the public school: fund, -

these are the very men whose children remain out of school. I 
make it a point to present this matter in its true light as occasion 
* offers. We must get the-boys and girls into the school- reom if we 
expect to benefit them. 
If the approving power can be restored to County Superintendents 
it will increase their labors but place them in a position to know 
precisely how the school fund is expended. It was unwise legiala- - 
tion to repeal this, act. 
If the opening of the school year cannot be changed, the County 
Superintendent should be elected in July, instead of January. It 
does seem to me a bad arrangement to elect an officer, when half of 
the year in which he is expected to report has expired, and when. 
it would be imprudent for him to make important’ changes that 
might present themselves. 
The text-book question is still unsettled in this county, and if 
the Legislature can come to the aid of the County Superintendents 
in establishing uniformity throughout the State by the appointment 
of suitable persons to make the adoption, I believe they ought to do 
it, A great diversity of authors, such as we have now; is a serious 
drawback to the prosperity of the schools ofthe State. To meet the 
demands of the different teachers for their favorite authors isa tax 
that parents are much inclined to rebel against.

from.some districts in the county. 
In some parts of this county we have aconsiderable interest man- 
ifested in public schools, while in others, we have the opposite. 
This, we think, is caused partly by the shape of the school districts. 
I think I will make an effort to get the county redistricted in order 
to have a more equal distribution of the school funds. In sparsely

teachers, inasmuch as they consider that there is nothing made to

all, 
There is marked improvement, in our schools over last year, and 
I think we are gradually improving. The minds of the people are 
becoming more awakened to the benefits tobe derived from them’; 
and another year, if the County Court reflects the sentiments-of the 
tax- payers, they will levy a tax sufficient to run the schools: five 
months in the year. 
Without more money we could scarcely hope for better schools. 
Our. county pays a tax of only ten cents on the hundred dollars’ , 
worth of taxable property for school purposes. . This, ‘together with 
the funda received from all other sources, extends our schools from .

WHITE COUNTY. 
J. J. Grissom, SUPERINTENDENT, Pollard. 
In submitting this, my second annual report, I am glad I can 
report general progress and interest. 
In the first place, I commenced my work last year by keeping 
before the people and teachers, through our county paper, many of 
the eduvational needs of the county. / 
I have also shown them, or endeavored to show them, the prac- 
ticability and general benefit of the public schoel system over the 
private ; the advantages it offers to the poor, and the economy to 
the rich. 
_ Now, when I tell them we have 4,304 children within school 
| ages, our monthly expense for running the schools and giving all 
this number the opportunity of attending, is only $1,591, the aver- 
" age cost of tuition per pupil per month is not quite 37 cents, for 
the number enrolled this year, 534 cents, and for those in daily
-P-A-G-E-166
(166 ) 
attendance, about m1 cents, a great many seem astonished at these 
facts, and are ready to asaist in public school work without further 
evidence. 
Last year I talked on inatitutes to our teachers, and got some to 
reading educational journals, which showed them that they were 
behiad in the march of educational progress, therefore, we had no 
trouble in’ organizing our teachers’ institute early in August,:at 
, which the major-part of-the best teachers attended segularly. The 
institute meets every two weeks. We have practical class-work, 
with demonstrations of methods of teaching, discussions in regard 
to discipline, ete. So, I think, our teachers will be greatly im- 
proved by our, institute work, which is still needed. 
One of our great needs is more funds; another is to get it cole 
lected and properly disbursed, for we have had trouble and loss in 
re-collecting from every-trustee since the war to the present term. 
This could ‘and should be remedied by a rigid execution of laws. 
I spoke of compulsory education in my report last year, there-’ 
’ fore, I will only say that I think it would work a great blessing on 
many of our careless people, and make our schools benefit those 
who-mostly need help, and are frequently indifferent to their own 
interest. It works well. in northern and eastern States, then why 
not in Tennessee ? | 
It will be seen from my statistical report that the average dura- 
“tion of our schools is a little short of three months. Now, this is 
on account of our trustee being behind, and the slow process of re- 
collecting by our’ prosecuting and executing officers; therefore, I 
». gut our schools about one-third short in order to get out of debt. 
T have advised and insisted on the teachers making their terms 
five months, where the houses can be made comfortable, and charge 
for the excess of the free school, which many are doing. 
Tam of the’ opinion that County Superintendents should settle. 
with trustees monthly, or at their regular times of settling, and re- 
“eeive the money, and thus become the disbursing agents ‘of the 
- school fund. 
Do this; require them to give a good and sufficient bond for the 
money likely to come into their hands; then the mony ¢ can. -be kept 
separate, every district. and teacher receive his part in due ime, 
and the ory of “bad management and speculation with: the hil. |

WILLIAMSON COUNTY. 
H. B. Watuace, SUPERINTENDENT, Franklin. 
I have the honor herewith to transmit my annual report of the 
schools of this (Williamson) County. It is as nearly correct as 
I could make it. 
The school interest in the county is growing and I believe that 
the people of the county are begining to realize the fact that the 
public schools must be looked to for the education of the ‘masses. 
To this end there has been a greater demand this year for good and 
efficient teachers in the public schools of the county than ever before. 
The county school tax has been raised from ten cents to fifteen 
cents-on the one hundred dollars, and at the coming January term 
of the County Court it will be raised to twenty cents. ' . 
To compel teachers to be examined and directors to perform their 
duties more promptly, the old provision, that all warrants should — 
be approved by the County Superintendent, ought to be re-enacted. 
Thave done all in my power to keep the districts out of debt, 
but in this I have not entirely succeeded. Would that I could 
entirely succeed in my attempts in this direction. 
have visited the schools of the county, talked to directors, 
teachers and patrons.every opportunity about the necessity of good 
schools, and have tried in every way to keep the school interest in 
their minds and alive in the county, and I must say I feel greatly 
encouraged in my work.

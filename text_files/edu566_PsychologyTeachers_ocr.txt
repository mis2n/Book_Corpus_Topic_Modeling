PREFACE 
— 
Tue belief of those who urge that the teacher whose 
business it is to minister to mental development should 
possess some systematic knowledge of psychology, has 
gained ground and become more widely spread since 
this little book appeared some twelve years ago. Mean- 
while in psychology itself there has been progress both 
in the organisation of its subject-matter and in methods 
of exposition. After more than a decade, therefore, 
careful revision of this book seemed necessary; a some- 
what fuller treatment appeared to be called for; a 
rather closer analysis seemed justifiable. But when I 
took the matter in hand it soon became evident that to 
carry out my purpose I must completely rewrite rather 
than merely revise my book, which now goes forth as 
a new work written with the same desire to be helpful 
to my colleagues in the teaching profession. 
I have to thank many correspondents for kindly 
* eriticism and friendly advice. One only has expressed 
dissatisfaction that I had written a Psychology for 
Teachers and not a manual of school practice. Lest 
others should take up the book under a misapprehen- 
sion of the purpose with which it has been written, 
I must here distinctly state that my object has been 
to set forth some of those principles of psychology,

vi PREFACE 
with especial reference to processes of mental develop- 
ment, which should be helpful to teachers through the 
light they throw on the manner of the working of the 
mind; and not, save incidentally, to indicate how 
these principles may be applied. I have desired to 
contribute rather to the education of the teacher than 
to his training. One of the points on which insistence 
is laid in this work is the importance of preparation. 
It is because I am convinced that a knowledge of 
psychology is of value to those who are engaged in the 
spread of education and the improvement of educa- 
tional methods, that I have written the chapters which 
follow. Mine is the task of aiding in the preparation 
of the teacher; his is the opportunity for application 
to particular problems and special subjects. 
On the comments of another critic I may be allowed 
to say a few words, since they may serve to elucidate 
my point of view. The child when he comes under 
the discipline of the teacher, even in the kindergarten, 
has already reached a certain level of mental develop- 
ment; he has gained some experience; he behaves in 
more or less appropriate ways under given circum- 
stances; he already possesses a good deal of intelligence 
although he has but little systematic knowledge. Why 
not start with him as he then stands? Why trouble 
to inquire how this practical and serviceable experience 
had its origin in the early months or years of life? 
The teacher, as such, it may be said, has little concern 
with it. He may take its existence for granted. Such 
is the contention of my critic. I think it not im- 
probable that others may, in some degree, share his 
views. They may feel some impatience with my genetic 
treatment of the initial stages of the dawn of child- 
consciousness, and the very beginnings of the mental
-P-A-G-E-7
PREFACE vii 
life. But it must be remembered that the process of de- 
velopment is one and continuous. It is impossible ade- 
quately to understand its later phases if the earlier 
stages are merely taken for granted. If once the prin- 
ciple of taking things for granted is admitted, we, so far, 
depart from the more rational principle of explaining 
matters. In every branch of inquiry which deals 
with continuity of process it has been found that the 
initial stages cannot be disregarded if the development 
as a whole is to be rendered clear. If we just accept 
the child as he is when he comes to school, without 
inquiring how he came to be what he already is, we 
shall not be in a position to understand how best to 
graft the systematic knowledge with which we are 
chiefly concerned on the naive experience with which it 
should be in vital touch. 
In any case a genetic method of treatment is de- 
liberately part of my settled purpose in the extended 
and, I trust, improved work which now leaves my 
hands. I would urge the teacher, so far as in him 
lies, to take a broad and comprehensive view of mental 
development, and to be a close observer of the workings 
of his own mind and of that of each pupil under his 
charge. As Sir Joshua Fitch said in the Preface which 
he contributed to the first edition, “It is not desirable, 
in the present state of our knowledge, that any one 
psychological theory should be universally accepted, 
and regarded as orthodox. What is desirable, is that 
men and women who intend to consecrate their lives 
to the business of teaching, should acquire the habit 
of studying the nature of the phenomena with which 
they have to deal; and of finding out for themselves 
the laws which govern mental processes, and the 
conditions of healthy growth in the minds and bodies
-P-A-G-E-8
  viii PREFACE 
of their pupils.” I trust that the words which he then 
added may still in some measure apply. “This book,” 
said Sir Joshua Fitch, “will help them much in such 
a study, and will do so all the more effectually, because. 
it does not undertake to save the schoolmaster the 
trouble of thinking out rules and theories for himself. 
The reader who consults these pages in quest of 
aphorisms, definite rules of action which are applicable 
to all cases, or ‘tips’ to be used in passing an exam- 
ination, will not find what he seeks. But he will get 
something better—the stimulus and suggestion which 
may help to make his own observations of child-nature 
more exact; the material for new thought; and not a 
little aid and encouragement in forming, day by day, 
a higher ideal both of the duty he has undertaken, and 
of the spirit in which it is to be done.”

CHAPTER I 
STATES OF CONSCIOUSNESS 
Many definitions have been given of the aim of Educa- 
tion. From a broad and comprehensive point of view it 
may be regarded as the means by which the individual is 
brought into vital touch with his environment. The word 
“environment” is used as a technical term in natural his- 
tory for all the surrounding conditions which in any way 
affect, or are affected by, an animal or plant. The en- 
vironment of a child or man comprises, therefore, all those 
external circumstances which influence his active life. In 
it there are a number of inanimate objects, some of them 
natural, some of them artificially shaped or produced. 
With them he must be acquainted, learn their uses, and 
acquire skill in handling them. Unless he can manip- 
ulate them freely he is not in vital touch with this part of 
his environment. Then there are his companions and fel- 
lows. They react quite differently from the inanimate 
objects. Instead of being passive they are active, like him- 
self. And he has to learn how they act towards him and 
respond to his own actions. Unless he is acquainted with 
their modes of give and take he is not in vital touch with 
1
-P-A-G-E-16
2 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
this part of his environment. Animals and plants in their 
several degrees stand either nearer to inanimate objects or 
nearer to his human fellows. The child when left to itself 
will get into practical touch with surrounding things and 
people. And this, in the broadest sense of the word, is 
part of his education. But the touch must grow wider, 
closer, and more accurate. Since he is a social being, 
language is a means to this end. Here the ministry of 
mother or nurse is helpful; and at a somewhat later stage 
the more specialised ministry of the teacher begins. For 
the teacher is a specialist, whose duty it is to adopt all 
accredited means of bringing the individuals committed 
to his charge into yet closer and more vital touch with 
an environment which grows wider and richer with the 
child’s advancing years. But how and in what sense does 
it grow wider and richer? 
It is clear that it is through experience that ability to 
deal with surrounding things and people is gained. 
Through such experience this, that, or the other situation 
of daily life acquires meaning, so that similar situations 
can be dealt with surely and promptly. To be in vital 
touch with the environment is therefore to be able to 
profit by the meaning which the events which happen 
therein have for our own active and practical life. But 
for intelligent beings the meaning becomes part of the en- 
vironment. When we remember that the environment is 
that with which the individual is in relation, we shall 
realise that surrounding things which evoke no responsive 
interest play no part in relation to the intelligence, and 
therefore form no part of its environment. (And when we 
remember that all experience’ is a mental product we 
shall realise that it is the meaning of things, rather than 
what we call the things themselves, that form the true 
environment of the developing mind.
-P-A-G-E-17
  STATES OF CONSCIOUSNESS 3 
Now let us suppose that two men, the one educated, the 
other ignorant, stand in the church of Ottery St. Mary, in 
Devonshire. The mere physical surroundings are the same. 
For both they have some meaning and significance. The 
solid walls mean barriers to passage outwards, the open 
doors mean lines of exit. For both, too, the church would 
have significance as a place of worship. That, at least, is 
part of the environment which begets, we may hope, the 
appropriate response in reverence of demeanour. But 
beyond this, what a difference in the environment! For 
the educated man the architecture is an environment full 
of historical associations. The columns and their capitals, 
the windows and their tracery, the forms of the arches 
have a significance for him that is absent in the case of 
the ignorant man. The church and its village, too, sug- 
gest to him literary associations. Here Coleridge was born 
and baptized. This was the Clavering of Thackeray’s 
Pendennis. Does not his education bring the one man into 
vital touch with an environment to the full significance of 
which the other is wholly insensible? 
We start, then, with an environment of nature, men and 
women, and human products. But man has gradually 
elaborated a system of knowledge concerning the world in 
which he lives. This he has projected upon, and woven 
into the tissue of his surroundings. To this enriched en- 
vironment we are the heirs. Newton has made the starry 
heavens an orderly system; Lyell has given to the frame- 
work of scenery a new significance. Darwin has helped 
us to see in plants and animals a plan which relates each 
with others. Historians, philosophers, and men of letters 
have taught us the significance of human life. 
But to know this environment we must be conscious 
of its existence, its value for practical endeavour, and its 
worth for our ideals of conduct. This depends on experi-
-P-A-G-E-18
  4 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
ence. Let us consider, from the psychological standpoint, 
the nature of our experience in the affairs of daily life. 
Psychology deals with states of consciousness. It is 
the study of their nature, their mode of origin, and the 
manner of their sequence. 
Suppose you are ushered into an unfamiliar room, being 
a few minutes too early for an appointment. You look 
round and take stock of its contents. You note the furni- 
ture, the ornaments on the mantelshelf, the pictures on 
the walls, the books on their shelves, the view from the 
window. All is new to you. You have seen none of these 
things before. You are made aware for the first time of a 
number of objects grouped in certain ways. Perhaps you 
admire the beauty of the view or the tastefulness of the 
furniture; perhaps you take a book from the shelves be- 
cause its title interests you; perhaps, almost mechanic- 
ally, you set straight a picture which hangs a little awry. 
You are gaining new experience ; but this new experience is 
interpreted in terms of your previous experience. The par- 
ticular things you see, the feelings they evoke, the actions 
they call forth, are new; but they belong to kinds of things, 
feelings, and behaviour which are quite familiar. Seeing 
the things, admiring them, doing something with them, are 
all modes of being conscious. In the unfamiliar room you 
have a sequence of states of consciousness a constituent 
feature of which is the sense of unfamiliarity itself. 
How different the feeling when you return to your own 
cosy little room and glance round at its well-known objects. 
Your interview is over, and that is a relief. You did not 
have a very sympathetic reception, and it has left you a 
little ruffled. All this is part of your state of conscious- 
ness. So, too, is the soothing effect of your present sur- 
roundings. Everything has so much pleasant meaning 
for you. The print over the fireplace may remind you of
-P-A-G-E-19
  
STATES OF CONSCIOUSNESS 5 
the painting from which it was engraved, and where 
you first saw it; the flowers in the vase, of the lane in 
which you plucked them, and of the bright companion 
who was with you. The clock may bring to mind its kind 
donor, and of the fact that a letter from him remains un- 
answered; the state of the fire, that a little judicious 
poking may be advisable, for it is your fire, almost a part 
of yourself, to coax and cherish at your pleasure. And 
then a photograph on your desk leads you gently on into 
a restful reverie concerning your past holiday. You briefly 
review this bit.of past experience, and your states of con- 
sciousness are now almost wholly occupied by the changing 
figures of your day-dream. Images of pleasant scenes, 
memories of healthy walks or rides, reminiscences of con- 
genial companions, come and go, enchained in a certain 
order by some community of interest; while other events, 
perchance those of former holidays, intrude themselves, 
dropping in like old acquaintances, unbidden but not un- 
welcome, and yet we should hardly say intrude; they are 
there because they properly belong to such situations as 
the reverie more or less faithfully reproduces. 
Perhaps you had not realised that in your ordinary 
dealing with the common situations of daily life there are 
some of the materials with which the abstruse and diffi- 
cult science of psychology is concerned. That is just 
because we quite naturally take so much of our everyday 
experience for granted. Simple and commonplace as it is, 
however, it forms part of the foundations of our mental 
life. Out of it arise the more elaborate products of 
abstract knowledge, strong emotion, and strenuous en- 
deavour. We must first study the simpler states of con- 
sciousness before we can attempt to understand those 
which are so much more complex. That is why we have 
begun with quite ordinary occurrences. But let us note
-P-A-G-E-20
  6 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
that it is with the experience as such that the science of 
psychology deals. And in that experience there is a two- 
fold reference. There is a reference to the objects you 
see, to the events that are occurring or have taken place, 
to your present or past surroundings; and there is a refer- 
ence to yourself as seeing them, as living or having lived 
in the midst of them, of being interested in them, worried 
by them or soothed by them, of behaving, or feeling a dis- 
position to behave, in certain ways, in their presence. 
Sometimes we, so to speak, lose ourselves in our interest 
in things and events; sometimes we regard them as only 
contributing to our own pleasure or annoyance. But ex- 
perience always has one or both of these kinds of refer- 
ence, objective and subjective as they are termed. 
Now any state of consciousness or, as it is sometimes 
called, field of consciousness includes all that is “in 
mind” at any given moment, understanding by the word 
“moment” a short but appreciable period of time, say one 
or two seconds. But what is the mind? Let us for the 
present leave this question unanswered. The term “mind ” 
stands for a very general and abstract conception. What- 
ever the mind may be as an actually existent reality, com- 
prising all our experience and all our knowledge, all our 
hopes and fears, all the impulses and motives which spur 
us to active endeavour, it is wider, fuller, richer, than 
any given field of consciousness. It somehow involves an 
available balance at the bank, from which the few coins 
laid down on the counter of consciousness are drawn. 
Or, to vary the analogy, the field of consciousness is the 
wine which our mental host places on the table from the 
bins of his cellar. Sometimes we feel sure that the sample 
provided comes from a well-stocked cellar of carefully 
chosen and matured vintages; sometimes we suspect that 
it has been hurriedly got in from the friendly grocer round
-P-A-G-E-21
  STATES OF CONSCIOUSNESS 7 
the corner. Our pupils are often shrewd enough to form 
a pretty accurate estimate of the source of what we place 
before them; whether it comes from our own mental 
cellar, or from the grocery stores represented by some 
half-crown text-book. What the mind is, then, we do 
not, for the present, attempt to determine. It suffices for 
us to realise that it is wider and deeper than the field of 
consciousness at any given moment. And it is this to 
which we must now direct our attention. 
The first thing to notice is that the field of consciousness 
is often exceedingly complex, and seldom very simple; that 
is to say, there is not only a single object of sense or of 
thought, and nothing more; a number of things are present 
all at once, some in the foreground, some in the back- 
ground, It is therefore necessary to analyse the field, and 
to distinguish its constituent features. Let us suppose 
that we are looking at the picture on the wall. There 
it is in what we may term the focus of vision. But we 
also see, less clearly, the wall on which it hangs, and per- 
haps much besides, in what we may call the margin of 
vision. As our eyes flit from object to object so as to 
bring to the focus what, but a moment ago, was in the 
dimmer margin, there is a succession of fields of conscious- 
ness in which the constituent features undergo a more or 
less continuous rearrangement. Furthermore, though we 
may pay little attention to them, save for purposes of 
analysis, there are other things present in what we may 
term the sensory margin; sounds such as the ticking of 
the clock and the crackle of wood in the fire-flame; scents, 
such as that of the flowers in the vase; pressures from 
what is in contact with our body, and those diffused sen- 
sory feelings of comfort or discomfort which are so hard 
to analyse. Any one of these may, in the process of 
analysis, leap into the sensory focus, the others slipping
-P-A-G-E-22
8 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
away into the margin. Nor are objects of sense, knock- 
ing gently or importunately at what John Bunyan called 
the gates of the soul, all that may characterise the stream 
of consciousness; there is whatsoever these several objects 
may suggest or recall, memories of the past or anticipa- 
tions of the future, far-reaching thoughts tinged with 
regret or with hope. They may remain in the background, 
or they may steal insensibly into the focus of consciousness. 
And, all the time, there is ever-varying rearrangement and 
resetting of the fields, with changes of their central points, 
and with much coming and going of impressions, images, 
and ideas. For a moment the scent of flowers is in the 
focus of consciousness, then this slips away into the 
margin as the vision of some quaint old walled garden 
steals upon us; our eye falls on the clock, and the position 
of the hands raises an expectation of the quarter’s chimes 
or the striking of the hour; perhaps before the anticipa- 
tion has been realised we remember that the clock should 
have been wound this morning. This kind of thing is 
familiar to everyone. A little analysis enables us to 
realise the complexity of the stream of consciousness. 
Abundant opportunities of realising this are afforded by 
the practice of the class-room. Subject-matter, manner of 
presentation, the starting-point and past stages, the end 
in view and the course of development towards that end, 
effectiveness and a sense of failure or success therein,— 
all are present in varying degrees. Maintenance of dis- 
cipline, voice-production and clearness of articulation, and 
a steady hold on the children’s attention, no matter how 
habitual they may have become, are there in the dim 
background, unobtrusive but ready in case of need. The 
familiar desk and other furniture of the well-known room, 
the sight of upturned faces, any one of which at any 
moment may send a message which shall change the
-P-A-G-E-23
  STATES OF CONSCIOUSNESS 9 
course of our consciousness, the subdued shufiling of feet, 
the freshness or otherwise of the atmosphere, the pose 
of the body and position of hand or arm,—all of these 
contribute in their several degrees to that wonderfully” 
complex state of existence which we term the field of 
consciousness. And behind all those upturned faces are 
similarly complex existences. Must we not realise this 
complexity, and endeavour to understand the conditions 
under which the subject-matter with which we are deal- 
ing may be brought to the foreground of consciousness in 
these young minds, and held there if we are to succeed in 
our work as teachers? They, too, have marginal con- 
stituents in the field of their consciousness, only too ready 
to usurp the central position, and render our pupils liable 
to the charge of inattention. 
The consideration of such a case shows that the analysis 
of the field into focal point and surrounding margin does 
not suffice. There is the focal point of attention; but 
there is much besides in the field of attention. The whole 
development of the lesson in relation to the pupils is in 
the field of attention. The teacher probably does not pay 
any special attention to the position of his hands or the 
state of the atmosphere; though he may do so. They lie 
in the outskirts of the field of consciousness, present and 
to some extent exercising an influence, but in the region 
of non-attention. The whole field may therefore be mapped 
out as—(1) the focus of attention, (2) the rest of the field 
of attention, and (3) the marginal outskirts in the region 
of non-attention. This must suffice for a preliminary 
survey; we must remember that in succeeding moments 
we have successive fields of consciousness. Each of these, 
like the isolated film which forms one of the series which 
produces an animated photograph or cinematograph 
picture, affords a more or less complicated grouping of

constituent features. And in the sequence of fields there 
is a continuous series. The field of any one moment may 
differ from that of the preceding moment by the incoming 
of new features and the outgoing of some of the previous 
features. But much of the change consists in a regroup- 
ing of the old constituents. If this were not so there 
would be no continuity in the stream of experience. 
We must now pass on to consider the nature of the 
constituent features—or factors, let us call them. We are 
well acquainted with the marked difference between the 
immediate and direct cognisance of surrounding things 
when they are actually present to the senses, and the 
revival of past experience when the objects themselves 
are no longer in sight or at hand. The distinction is so 
familiar, and under ordinary circumstances so complete, 
that there is little need of illustration. We are seldom 
in doubt whether we actually see or touch a thing, or 
merely have in the field of consciousness a revived image 
of the thing. Only in abnormal circumstances or under 
abnormal conditions have we any hesitation in saying 
whether an object is actually before our eyes or at our 
finger-tips, or not. And we may here neglect such ab- 
normal cases. The facts being so familiar it is only 
necessary to give the terminology. All that is in the field 
of consciousness by a process of direct cognisance through 
sight, touch, hearing, smell, taste, and so forth, is present- 
ative. And when we analyse this presentative field, each 
part of it which we interpret as a distinguishable factor, 
is an impression. It is a sensory impression; that is to 
say, a factor introduced by the stimulation of some organ 
of sense, such as eye, ear, finger-tip, or palate. Of such 
impressions your field of consciousness in the strange room 
was largely constituted. Afterwards, in your armchair at 
home perhaps, you recall the appearance of the waiting-
-P-A-G-E-25
  STATES OF CONSCIOUSNESS it 
room. All that is in the field of consciousness through the 
revival of previous sensory experience is re-presentative. 
And when we analyse the re-presentative field, each part 
of it which answers to a direct impression is an image. 
The visible hands of the clock when our eyes fall on the 
dial are presentative; the chimes which we expect to hear 
in a few seconds are re-presentative; they are presentative 
when they actually ring out and directly affect our organ 
of hearing. Note that recollections of the past and an- 
ticipations of the future are at the moment of their occur- 
rence present to consciousness, though they are not 
presentative. Their pastness or their futurity is a matter 
of reference—something about them which leads us to. 
refer their presentative occurrence to some period of time 
other than that of the moment when they are images in 
the field of consciousness. And note that we are here 
somewhat extending the common use of the word “ image.” 
The remembered musical chord or nosegay-scent is the 
image corresponding to some previous impression of hear- 
ing or of smell. 
There are many kinds of impressions—more than those 
of the traditional five senses—which are dealt with in 
treatises of psychology. Those which play an important 
part in the daily routine of educational procedure are— 
(1) the visual impressions, those of sight; (2) the auditory 
impressions, those of hearing; (3) impressions of touch, 
especially those of the hands and fingers; and (4) the 
impressions afforded by the movements executed by our 
limbs, our fingers, our eyes in their sockets, and so forth. 
Those which fall under the fourth heading are of very 
great importance. Assure yourself of their existence as 
direct modes of experience. Look at the clock-face, or 
any other particular object; shut your eyes; and, not too 
hurriedly, point your finger at the object. Do this twice
-P-A-G-E-26
  12 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
or thrice, still with your eyes shut, and note your states 
of consciousness. You will be able to note two things. 
First, you picture to yourself, though you do not see, the 
movements of your finger, hand, and arm; you have a 
series of visual images. Secondly, you feel pretty clearly 
the movements of, and in, the limb as you bring it into 
position. Draw a circle in the air or on the blackboard 
with your eyes shut; again you probably visualise the 
sweep of your arm, but you also feel with surprising 
distinctness the impressions due to its movement. Walk 
about the room; every change of position of your legs is 
affording you direct information of the movements they 
are executing. Let your eyes wander from object to object, 
and pay attention to their movements in the sockets; a 
little practice in self-observation will enable you to feel 
them quite clearly. Now hold up a pencil or penholder 
about eight inches from your face and in the line of vision 
of the picture on the far wall. Alternately fix your eyes 
on the pencil-end and on the picture, and attend to the 
impressions in and round your eyes. Do you not feel 
quite plainly your eyes going, so to speak, from the one to 
the other? The focussing of the two eyes, and sundry 
motor adjustments within each eye, give rise to impres- 
sions just as real and direct as those of sight or of hearing. 
And to all these impressions there are corresponding 
images. You can recall or imagine what you would feel 
if you lifted your arm and placed your hand on the back 
of your neck, and what direct experience you would have 
if you were in the act of kicking a football. In doing so 
you call up re-presentative images which answer to the 
presentative impressions due to the actual execution of the 
movements. 
I have said that the four chief kinds of impressions 
which play their part in the ordinary routine of educa- 
 
-P-A-G-E-27
  STATES OF CONSCIOUSNESS 13 
tional procedure are the visual, the auditory, those of 
touch, and those which accompany active behaviour. 
Any or all of them take part also in giving rise to 
re-presentative imagery; but probably in varying degrees 
in different individuals. One or other may take the lead, 
and be dominant in revival of what has occurred in past 
experience. For example, three men go to an operatic 
performance, an artist, a musician, and an actor. In sub- 
sequent memory the artist may see most clearly the 
pictured scenes, auditory images and those of action may 
play only a subordinate part. His type of imagery is 
mainly, but probably not exclusively, visual. The musician 
perhaps recalls most vividly the melodies and harmonies, 
the rich sound effects; but if he is a violinist or a singer 
he may, both when he hears the opera and when he 
recalls it, supplement the auditory impressions or images 
with those re-presentative of what it would feel like to 
play this passage or sing that aria. On the other hand, 
the actor may have a strong tendency to reproduce the 
gestures and attitudes of the players: he cannot sit still 
when he tells you about the piece; he must reenact the 
scenes and mimic the performers on the stage. His type 
of imagery is predominantly that which introduces motor 
activity. Some of us remember best what we have read 
ourselves, visualising the words and sentences; others 
recall more clearly what they have heard, having clear 
auditory images of the tones and inflexions of the voice. 
Yet others find that they revive with most ease what they 
have read aloud, or at any rate with silent movement of 
the lips, or what they have written. The typist may 
clearly recall the movements of the fingers in tapping off 
the words; and so on. It is not unlikely that we are born 
with, or inherit a tendency for one kind of imagery to pre- 
dominate over the others; but the emphasis on one type is
-P-A-G-E-28
  14 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
also largely due to education in a broad sense of the word 
—that is to say, the outcome of the predominant training 
in the use of one or the other mode of imaging. The 
teacher should therefore afford opportunities for the 
development of a mixed type in which all forms of 
imagery are present, co-operating with each other in repro- 
ducing all forms of serviceable impressions. This is, of 
course, familiar to us in educational procedure. In an 
object lesson we let the object appeal directly to all the 
senses which can be affected by it; we give the child 
opportunities not only of seeing it but, as far as practic- 
able, of handling it; we also let the child hear the names 
of its parts, see them written on the blackboard, pro- 
nounce them, write them down, and so forth. We have 
learnt by experience that this varied appeal to different 
modes of dealing with the object, and with the words by 
means of which it may be described, makes the child 
remember it all more easily. But we may fail to notice 
that through the object lesson we are affording a training 
in the establishment of related modes of imagery which 
has an influence in development, extending far beyond the 
limits of the object lesson. 
There is one more group of impressions to which only 
passing allusion need here be made. When you read some 
particularly thrilling chapter in a novel, or see some pic- 
ture which stirs you deeply, or listen to some piece of 
music which appeals to you strongly, do you not experi- 
ence a quickening of the pulse, a catch of the breath, 
and much besides, tingling through your bodily frame? 
Such experiences are accompanied by a toning up of the 
muscles. By appropriate instruments it may be shown 
that under such circumstances the heart-beat is increased, 
the circulation quickened, the respiration rendered fuller 
and deeper, the muscles braced up. All this gives rise
-P-A-G-E-29
  STATES OF CONSCIOUSNESS 15 
to a voluminous and massive group of organic impressions 
which are markedly present in all strong states of emo- 
tion. There are corresponding images. But when they 
are revived there is generally also a revival of the im- 
pressions themselves. Our hearts, respiratory organs, and. 
muscles are again actually tuned up to a state of increased 
vigour. 
So far, then, we have impressions of various kinds, and 
their answering images as constituent factors in the field 
of consciousness. The former are presentative, the latter 
re-presentative. It will be noticed that the word “ re-pre- 
sentative” is printed with a hyphen—being pronounced 
with an accent on the “re.” So written and pronounced 
it serves to distinguish the images which are revived in 
the field of consciousness from the presentative impres- 
sions. But the impressions are always particular and in- 
dividual. If we let our eyes range over a flock of sheep, 
each individual animal may come to the focus as a clear- 
cut impression. But if, as we sit at home, we recall our 
experiences in the field, what we visualise is not any par- 
ticular sheep, with all its delicate shades of difference 
from other sheep, but what is common to a number of 
individuals. We can indeed visualise either a white sheep 
or a black one; but neither of them has to the full that 
perfectly clear-cut individuality which the impression 
of this or that animal would have. Just as the word 
“sheep” is a common noun, or a name common to a 
number of individuals, so is our image of a sheep, to some 
extent, a common, or to employ the technical term, a 
generic image. Such generic images are sometimes likened 
to composite photographs. If we have a negative plate 
whose period of exposure is twelve seconds, and expose 
before it six similarly arranged photographs of six differ- 
ent sheep, each for two seconds, the negative will receive  
-P-A-G-E-30
    16 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
six superimposed impressions, and the positive obtained 
from it will give a composite portrait combining the 
salient characters of all six. To this composite portrait the 
generic image is sometimes likened. And in the case of 
the sheep, the analogy (so long as it is regarded as only 
an analogy) may be helpful. But if we take a composite 
photograph of six triangles—equilateral, right-angled, 
scalene, and so forth—we shall get a more or less blurred 
positive or the result of six faint and under-exposed 
negatives. When we visualise a triangle, the image is not 
of this kind. It is sharp and clear-cut. It is a particular 
image which stands for any member of the class or group 
of figures. It is thus not only re-presentative in the 
technical sense above defined, but also representative in 
the ordinary sense of the word with its common spelling 
and pronunciation. The images which appear in the field 
of consciousness at the bidding of such words as “ park,” 
“cottage,” “tree” (supposing that we do visualise), are 
probably representative as well as re-presentative. 
Now it is clear (and the fact should never be forgotten 
by the teacher) that re-presentation is entirely dependent 
on previous presentation; in other words, neither we nor 
our pupils can recall an image of that of which we have had 
no direct experience. Even the products of pictorial fancy 
and imagination—the situations portrayed by artists in 
word-painting—are but a regrouping and recombination of 
the materials with which our past experience has made us 
acquainted. Ifa poet or novelist describe for us the flowing 
river, gleaming sands, background of mountains, hushed 
stillness broken only by the low plash of the wavelets and 
the sad cry of the sea-mew, yacht beating up the wind, and 
beneath the ruined boat, half-buried in the sand, a youth 
and a maid, we have re-presentative and representative 
images, because we have had presentative impressions of
-P-A-G-E-31
  STATES OF CONSCIOUSNESS 17 
such things. But if he introduces an oyster-catcher by the 
water’s edge, there will be a blank in our picture unless we 
are familiar with the black-and-white plumage and orange 
bill of the bird which in the North is called the sea-pie. 
False images may perhaps be suggested by “oyster-catcher” 
and “ sea-pie ”—perhaps of a man with a shrimping-net, 
perchance of a weird dish of strange sea-hares and sea- 
cucumbers. But supposing that the word has at first no 
definite meaning for us, still we can in such cases fill in 
the blank to some extent by reading descriptions of the 
bird, hearing about its form, size, markings, and mode of 
life, seeing pictures of it, and so forth; utilising impres- 
sions of which we have experience to build up a substitu- 
tive image of that which we have never actually seen. Such 
descriptive work must of necessity occupy a considerable 
place in educational procedure. But we must not forget 
that descriptive information is of much less value for the 
great majority of our pupils than actual observation, which 
is the true and sure basis of practical working experience. 
Think of some rare plant which you have seen and 
examined with care, and of some other plant, the descrip- 
tion of which you have read and studied with equal care. 
Which of the two stands out with greater vividness before 
the mind’s eye; of which do you remember the salient 
features the more distinctly? Can there be any question 
as to the answer? Substitutive images are the makeshifts 
of educational procedure, at any rate in its earlier stages. 
But they increase in value and importance as the body of 
direct experience grows richer and more coherent.) 
We must now pass on to the consideration of the field 
of consciousness from a somewhat different point of view. 
Again let us revert to the unfamiliar room into which we 
are ushered. The field is fully occupied with a number of 
impressions. At any moment one of these, say the clock  
-P-A-G-E-32
  18 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
on the mantel-shelf, is in the focus of vision and of atten- 
tion. The others are grouped round it in the margin of 
vision, the picture above it, the fireplace below, the book- 
case to the left, the cabinet to the right, and so on. This 
grouping involves the relations of the impressions within 
the field. Note that just in so far as there is a field of 
consciousness, with several or many impressions or images 
as constituent factors, these must be related to each other 
in certain ways. In the visual field the centre of reference 
for the spacial relationships is, for practical experience, the 
focus of the field—that particular impression to which 
attention is directed. It is a constantly shifting centre. 
As our eyes flit from object to object the focal impression 
changes, and the space relations of other objects, more dimly 
seen, are re-arranged. But this does not go on aimlessly. 
Suppose that you are one of those natty persons who are 
worried by crooked arrangements. As you look at the clock 
you notice that the picture to the left hangs a little awry. 
Instantly your eyes leap to it so as to make it focal. 
Though you feel, perhaps, that it is no business of yours, 
you stretch out your hand and set it straight. We now 
see the practical value of the relationships in the field of 
consciousness. The impression of the picture in the margin 
of vision means so much turning of the eyes to make it 
focal; and this means so much walking towards it, and 
reaching up of the hand to set it straight. The value of 
a field of consciousness is for behaviour; and the act of 
behaving itself gives constituent factors in the field. That 
is where the importance of impressions due to behaviour in 
the execution of appropriate movements becomes evident. 
For practical experience, all the commoner relationships, 
such as those we express by the words larger, smaller, 
heavier, lighter, nearer, farther, rougher, smoother, and 
so forth, form parts of a presented situation actually before
-P-A-G-E-33
  
STATES OF CONSCIOUSNESS 19 
us. This is heavier than that; one object is nearer than 
the other; the marble shelf is smoother than the table- 
cloth. And the outlook is essentially practical, with direct 
reference to behaviour. The greater weight of this chair 
means a greater output of muscular energy; that more 
distant book on the table means a longer reach; the rougher 
tablecloth will afford a more secure surface than the marble 
slab for this photograph frame. 
But we say that this chair looks heavier than that; the 
tablecloth looks rougher than the polished marble; and so 
on. What do these modes of speech signify? This: that 
the visual impressions have meaning for other modes of 
experience; that they suggest certain modes of behaviour, 
or at any rate what would be the result of so behaving. 
‘The visual impression as such is presentative ; but it carries 
with it a fringe of re-presentative meaning for practical 
purposes; and this meaning has been acquired through 
previous experience. The infant has a great many impres- 
sions which as yet have no meaning. But every hour and 
every day he is acquiring fresh experience, and every hour 
and every day the impressions carry more and more mean- 
ing. For us who have had so much experience and in such 
varied ways, the field of consciousness is a complicated pro- 
duct of the presentative material of impressions, and the 
re-presentative supplement of meaning. And any re-pre- 
sentative image will have its re-presentative fringe. As I 
write, the sounds of a dog’s bark fall upon my ear; it is 
an auditory impression which at once suggests “ Nibs,” 
the black Aberdeen terrier; and this again suggests that I 
should open the door and let him in. It has meaning for 
practical behaviour. And the practical behaviour is of 
such a familiar kind that much of its execution lies in the 
field of non-attention. I so far attend to “ Nibs” and his 
needs as to go and open the door for him, but the getting
-P-A-G-E-34
  20 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
up from my seat and walking there requires no attention. 
I have done this kind of thing so often that it is wholly 
subsidiary to the purpose it subserves. 
In our adult years a great deal of the business of life is 
transacted in the marginal or subconscious region. In 
matters of skill, for example, though the acquisition and 
perfecting of control over our bodily activities is focal and 
demands attention, yet when the skill has been acquired 
and is well established, the subsequent performance of the 
activities is to a large extent relegated to the margin of 
non-attention. We learn to walk, to run, to knit, to play 
the piano, to ride a bicycle; and the learning requires con- 
stant focal attention. But when the skilful performance 
of these actions has by practice become perfect, we may 
do any of these things, and do them well, while the field 
of attention is occupied with other impressions. The 
peasant woman knits and walks; but in the focus of her 
consciousness is yonder fair-haired girl whom the stalwart 
young fellow is, quite unnecessarily, helping over the stile. 
The pianist’s fingers are running softly over the keys; but 
his eyes and thought are fixed on his mother’s portrait. 
The cyclist bowls along the road; but it is the delicately- 
shaded greenery of the spring that holds his attention. 
And in these cases it is probably incorrect to say that the 
actions are performed unconsciously. The word subcon- 
sciously better conveys the fact that they are carried out 
within the region of non-attention. We are dimly aware 
of what is occurring there; but only if something goes 
wrong in the subconscious procedure does the matter come 
into the field of attention. Thus the cyclist guides his 
machine, avoids stones in the road, and adjusts his output 
of energy to the gradient in response to stimuli coming 
from without. But the skill he has been at the pains of 
acquiring has become so far a habit that it no longer
-P-A-G-E-35
  STATES OF CONSCIOUSNESS 21 
requires his focal attention. Marginal awareness suffices 
for the guidance and control of his machine. With 
regard to what takes place in the subconscious region it 
is necessary to exercise self-observation. Only by doing 
so can one fully realise all that occurs in the margin of 
consciousness. Paradoxical as it may sound, the only way 
to learn how much goes on in the region of non-attention, 
is to pay some attention to it. Of course it is then no 
longer in that dimmer region. But only thus can we 
realise that it was there before we began to attend to it. 
We now have as constituent factors of states of con- 
sciousness, either in the field of attention or the region 
of non-attention, impressions and images, having certain 
relationships, and more or less suffused with meaning for 
practical behaviour as the outcome of previous experience. 
So far I have said nothing of sensations. The term is 
sometimes used as the equivalent of what I have spoken 
of as impressions. But it may be more conveniently 
used for the elementary constituents which may be dis- 
closed by an analysis of the impressions themselves. For 
example, the same note played on the flute, the violin, 
and the cornet, gives in each case a different auditory 
impression. When the note is analysed the difference 
in timbre is found to be due to certain overtones or 
partials accompanying the dominant tone. These afford 
sensations which contribute to produce the particular 
impression. .Thus an impression may be analysed into 
constituent sensations which combine to give it a special 
character. So, too, the impression produced by the flavour 
of coffee may be analysed into sundry taste-sensations 
combined with sundry smell-sensations. These can be 
distinguished; and the coffee-taster has to cultivate such 
analysis as shall enable him to recognise special aroma. 
One more example will suffice. The impressions we 
 
-P-A-G-E-36
22 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
receive from the movements of hand and arm are made up 
of many sensations from the muscles and their sheaths, 
the tendons, the skin, the smooth surfaces of the joints, 
and so on. But though they may be thus analysed 
by specially devised means, they are, for the practical 
purposes of daily life, just accepted as impressions which 
have meaning for the guidance of behaviour. As we have 
seen, even the impressions are the results of an analysis 
of the field of consciousness; but the analysis here into 
constituent sensations is carried further for the purposes 
of scientific inquiry. It only remains to add that sensa- 
tions are presentative: what answer to them in re- 
presentative imagery are sometimes spoken of as the 
sensory elements. These coalesce or combine to form images. 
I am well aware that all this terminology is at first 
puzzling. Familiar words are used in special ways and 
with restricted significance. All I can do is to try and 
make the usage clear. I see before me an inkpot. I 
have a visual impression. Now the impression as such is 
only the visual part of the matter; nothing more. It is 
what I actually see; the bare: sight of the thing. In so 
far as it has meaning, suggests that the thing is hard, and 
smooth, and cold—suggests to me as I write that I can 
dip my pen into its contents, it is related to my experi- 
ence of inkpots. An impression which thus carries a 
fringe of meaning for one’s practical behaviour is termed 
a percept. We shall have more to learn about percepts 
later on. But the impression I receive is made up of a 
number of visual sensations. I can analyse it into darker 
and lighter portions. These sensations, each of which is 
so elementary that I can analyse it no further, coalesce 
or combine to form the impression as a whole. If I form 
a mental picture of the inkpot in another room it is an 
image. This, too, may carry perceptual meaning. It is
-P-A-G-E-37
STATES OF CONSCIOUSNESS 23 
re-presentative as a whole, and made up of re-presentative 
sensory elements. All this, I am aware, is somewhat 
puzzling. But I am endeavouring to help you to frame 
definite ideas concerning the constituent factors in those 
very complex existences—states of consciousness. 
The term idea, however, like the term “ sensation,” is 
one which is used by different writers with a varying 
range of significance. Sometimes it is used in such a 
sense as to include images, and even impressions. I 
propose to use the term only for what are called general 
ideas or abstract ideas. They are the constituent factors 
of those states of consciousness which deal with system- 
atic knowledge. Let us take one or two illustrative 
cases. 
The familiar word “clock” may first recall to your 
mind an image of that particular clock which stands on 
the mantel-shelf of your room; it revives part of a 
pictured situation; but that is not the general idea which 
the word suggests. What, then, is that idea? Is it not 
that of a piece of mechanism which serves to mark the 
course of time? The idea is perhaps better expressed by 
the old-fashioned word “timepiece.” The word and its 
idea is applicable to any clock. If you recall your ex- 
periences of a number of clocks you may have, in 
succession, a number of images; but common to all of 
them is the idea of timepiece; that is the force of the 
word “general” as characteristic of the idea. You also 
get rid of all differences of detail, size, shape, Ha 
of the case, and so forth; that is the force of the Word 
“abstract,” which is also usually applicable to the idea? 
Notice, however, that the word “timepiece” is more 
general and abstract than the word “clock”; it is 
common to both clocks and watches, and, perhaps, sun- 
dials. And notice, too, that the particular clock of any
-P-A-G-E-38
24 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
given situation may be regarded, and is regarded from the 
point of view of systematic thought, as an example or 
illustration of the general and abstract idea. 
“Colour” is an abstract and general word. What does 
it suggest when it meets your eye or falls upon your 
ears? Different people will give different answers to this 
question. Suppose it suggests a geranium plant, with its 
scarlet flowers and green leaves. This may exemplify and 
illustrate, but it does not exhaust the idea of colour. In - 
any pictured situation you may visualise something to 
which the word and its idea applies: but you can form 
no image of the idea as such, that is to say in its 
generality and abstractness. It refuses to be imaged save 
in its concrete examples. It has therefore been asked: 
“What is this so-called abstract idea, but a general name 
which is applicable to a number of particular cases?” 
Still the name or word does something to guide our 
mental processes. If so, what does it do? Try and 
answer this question for yourself. The following may 
be helpful as a point of view. You say to a class of 
children: “To-day we will talk about: ” Before you 
have filled in the missing word the children’s minds are 
thrown into a state of vague expectancy. You are going 
to talk about something; but it may be anything in the 
world of experience. Now you add the word “ colour.” 
The range of expectancy is limited to what is called a 
definite universe of discourse. The mind hangs poised, 
as it were, over a certain area of sensory experience, and 
perhaps perches now on this and now on that example. 
You proceed: “We will begin by selecting ‘blue.’ ” 
The range of expectancy is further limited. Thus you 
may pass to “peacock-blue,” “pale peacock-blue,” and at 
last to “this pale peacock-blue feather.” Thus you have 
reached by successive stages the particular example in a  
-P-A-G-E-39
STATES OF CONSCIOUSNESS 25 
presented situation. But it is a particular example of a 
general and abstract idea. From this point of view we 
may regard ideas as stages in the limitation of thought. 
Now there is a word which I have had frequent occasion 
to use, namely “object.” Let us inquire what idea is 
suggested by it. We all know the common use of this 
word for the things around us—the writing-table, the ink- 
stand, the pen-wiper, the letter-weight, and so on. These 
-are objects which directly appeal to our senses—objects 
of which we gain experience through impressions. The 
limitation here, therefore, is to objects of sensory experi- 
ence. Is the word “object,” then, as applied to any one 
of these things around us, only a different name for what 
we have already termed an impression? No: a little con- 
sideration will show that it implies something more. The 
golden pippin which we see on the sideboard not only 
does afford a visual impression, but it can afford other 
impressions. We can touch it, lift it, smell it, bite it, taste 
it. When we describe an object of sense we write down 
a list of the various kinds of impression which it can 
afford, and the ways in which they are related. All of 
this is not, however, suggested by the sight of an object; 
at most the actual impression is surrounded by a sort of 
marginal fringe of further possibilities for experience, any 
one of which may be, but none of which need be, within 
the field of attention. Which of these many possibilities 
for experience is actually recalled and attended to depends 
upon the practical requirements of the situation. Water 
may at once suggest something to drink, something to 
wash in, something to boil, something to put flowers into, 
something wherewith to soak peas, something which will 
extinguish fire, and so forth. The situation of the 
moment determines which. In our class teaching we 
may have to refer to quicksilver or mercury in connection

with its weight, its fluidity, its metallic lustre, or its 
expansion with rise of temperature. Which of these 
several properties is made prominent depends upon the 
part of the system of knowledge we wish to bring into 
the field of attention. 
The object of sense, then, is a centre of reference for 
actual and possible impressions. It is what we can see, 
touch, handle, manipulate, and examine. It has meaning 
for our practical experience. It is that to which our 
percepts have reference when we are dealing with things 
in the world in which we live. We become acquainted 
with it by perceptual process. But we also speak of objects 
of thought. Infinity, empty space, virtue, ambition, states 
of consciousness may be objects of our thought. They 
involve abstract and general ideas, and those factors in 
consciousness which we shall Tearn to call concepts. They 
are founded on, or extracted from, our practical experience ; 
but they have special reference to constituent factors in 
the systematic knowledge by which that experience is 
interpreted. They belong to what is termed ideational 
process. The general and abstract idea to be conveyed 
by the term object is therefore a centre of reference— 
(1) for actual or possible practical experience; (2) for 
actual or possible systematic thought. But it implies 
someone who experiences and someone who thinks. This 
is the other side of the twofold reference of which I spoke 
before. The idea to be conveyed by the term subject in 
psychology is the centre of reference for actual or possible 
states of consciousness, as mine (for me) or yours (for you). 
Around this subjective centre of reference cluster our 
pleasures and pains, our feelings and emotions, our hopes 
and fears, our strivings and endeavours. These with the 
related impressions, images, and ideas which call them into 
being, are constituent factors in our states of consciousness.

CHAPTER II 
PREPARATION AND APPLICATION: KNOWING, FEELING, AND 
DOING 
WE have seen that the word “object,” in its wider sig- 
nificance, denotes anything which is or may be brought 
to the focus of our sensory experience or our thought. 
We only attend to it fully<apply our minds to it—when 
it thus occupies a central position. Thus in a nature-study 
ramble, a water-rat beneath the river’s bank, a hovering 
kestrel, a tree-creeper on the elm-trunk, may be an object 
of sensory experience. But, as we say in common speech, 
there must be something about them which attracts the 
attention, something which brings them to the focus of 
consciousness, something which ministers to mental appli- 
cation. What is this something? Does it, so to speak, 
reside in, so as to be limited to, the impression we receive, 
—that is to say, the bare presentation to the visual ° 
sense? Is it the mere strength or insistency of the 
impression? Not wholly, at any rate. No doubt strong 
impressions, insistent impressions, do arrest the attention ; 
but so also do relatively weak ones. Amid the glare of 
familiar poppies in the field, some small rare flower may 
claim our especial notice. It is not, then, necessarily the 
strength or insistence of the impression in its own right, 
as a presentation to the senses, that suffices to bring it to 
the focus of attention. 
27
-P-A-G-E-42
28 PSYCHOLOGY oe TEACHERS 
Whether a child will or will not notice a tree-creeper 
slipping round the trunk of the elm depends far more on 
the character and experience of the child than on the 
strength and insistency of the impression as such. We 
have seen that the object is a centre of reference for 
actual and possible impressions. For the observant child, 
who has taken country walks under sympathetic guidance, 
there is an expectation that the tree-creeper situation is 
likely to develop or change in certain ways. That is the 
meaning which the sight of the bird has acquired through 
previous experience. And this expectation of further 
development is an important factor in the attention 
process. But this is supplementary to, and not merely 
part of the bare presentation. Nor would there be any 
expectancy save under the conditions of some sort of 
preparation through previous experience of like situations. 
The child, too, is thrown into a mental attitude of alert- 
ness: the impression begets an active response, some form 
of application of the mental and bodily energies, if it be 
only in the act of further focussing the attention. What 
does all this imply? Does it not imply that for the atten- 
tive consciousness the impression is not isolated and in- 
dependent? The visual impression tree-creeper is, for the 
observant child, related to the existing body of practical 
experience. It has meaning; and it can only be assimilated 
on the condition that a neler portion of that experience 
a drawn up into the field of consciousness. By the term 
“assimilation ” we are to understand that the new experi- 
ence comes into line with similar experience previously 
gained, within which the new features are incorporated. 
If we speak of the tree-creeper as occupying the focus of 
attention we must remember that there is much more in 
the field of attention. All that is interesting in the 
situation and its expected development constitutes the
-P-A-G-E-43
PREPARATION AND APPLICATION 29 
field of attention, around which there are a number of 
subconscious impressions which are contributing to the 
field of consciousness as a whole, but are irrelevant. These 
are within the surrounding region of non-attention. They 
are being attended from and not attended to. 
Now suppose that a boy or girl is watching a partial 
eclipse of the moon. The occurrence will only have signi- 
ficance if there is some comprehension of the manner in 
which such an event is caused. No heed (of the intel- 
lectual kind) will be paid to it unless the relevant portion 
of a system of knowledge be drawn up into the field of 
consciousness. Then attention will be paid to it as a 
particular case which illustrates certain astronomical prin- 
ciples. It can only be intellectually assimilated in its 
relation to that part of the system of knowledge which it 
illustrates. The diminishing crescent of the moon is in 
the focus of attention; but all that it signifies is in the 
field of attention. And the fact that it has such signifi- 
cance implies that this changing visual impression finds 
its due place in reference to the system of knowledge to 
which it is related. There may be much in the field of 
non-attention—but this is irrelevant, and may be—nay is 
—neglected. Now it is clear that such application of 
thought is impossible in the absence of systematic prepara- 
tion of the intellectual kind. For the boy or girl who 
had learnt nothing whatever about such events, neither 
the appearance of the moon nor the word “ eclipse” would 
have any significance. 
It would seem, then, that the “something” about an 
impression, or the idea it suggests which attracts attention 
—or more accurately, is the condition which is necessary 
for the attention process—is the connection it has with the 
body of experience, or the system of knowledge; that this 
implies what I have spoken of as meaning or as signifi-

cance; and that it is dependent upor. some form of 
previous preparation. 
I have here drawn a distinction between the body of 
practical experience and the system of knowledge. I 
cannot, however, expect that the grounds of this distinc- 
tion will at present be clear, or its validity admitted with- 
out question. It must now suffice to say that by using 
the phrase “a system of knowledge,” I wish to imply a 
scheme of thought of which the constituent factors are 
general and abstract ideas. It comprises the net results 
of a number of the situations which have been presented to 
practical experience, from which the essential features have 
been selected and rebuilt as an ideal construction in thought. 
Much of our educational work is directed towards assisting 
our pupils to form such ideal constructions, such schemes 
of thought as may be applicable to concrete experience. 
Now we have seen that the mind, however we may 
define it, is fuller and richer than any given field of con- 
sciousness. It may contain, somehow stored up in it, a 
wide body of practical experience, an adequate fund of 
systematic knowledge. But this is serviceable, at the 
moment of consciousness, that is to say, on any particular 
occasion, only in so far as the relevant part of it is 
drawn up into the mental field so as to enter into 
the relationships which are essential to the attention 
process. Presumably we all know how hard it is, espe- 
cially if we are engrossed in some other inquiry, to 
answer off-hand a difficult or out-of-the-way question 
which is suddenly propounded, though we are fully aware 
that we can answer it. We say: “Don’t ask me just now. 
Tl think it over and tell you presently.” This does 
not necessarily imply that we must hunt the question up 
in some book. We need do nothing of the sort. What 
we have to do is to keep the question before us until it
-P-A-G-E-45
PREPARATION AND APPLICATION 31 
calls up into the field of consciousness the relevant part 
of our systematic knowledge to which the problem is 
related. This may require some purposeful effort of recol- 
lection. We have to put the problem in its appropriate 
surroundings,—its proper environment. Then the answer 
comes to mind. We speak correctly when we say that we 
have to think about it. Not improbably when the question 
is asked we feel little or no interest in it or the answer. 
But when we think the matter over, and get, as we say, 
the bearings of the question, we feel old interests revive, 
because the relationships are brought again into the field 
of consciousness. 
Suppose, then, that a teacher is accustomed to deal day 
by day with some special system of knowledge, say in 
physical science or mathematics. He enters the class- 
room, and at once, or after a mere glance of preparatory 
thought, the part of the system relevant to what he is 
going to teach is present in the field of consciousness. 
What he is about to demonstrate is set in its due relation- 
ships, and is thus for him suffused with interest. He is 
prepared to start at once and take up his theme exactly 
where he left off last week. But is it reasonable that he 
should do so; or, if he does, that he should expect his 
pupils to be in a position immediately to attend and to 
assimilate? Some twenty or five-and-twenty boys have 
either come into the classroom fresh from the pleasant 
situations of the playground, or with the field of conscious- 
ness still partially occupied with the preceding hour’s 
French or history lesson. What they have previously 
learnt in mathematics or physical science, is therefore out 
of touch with the present stream of consciousness. Hence 
the wise and skilful teacher occupies the first part of his 
allotted hour in recapitulation, the object of which is to 
prepare the field of consciousness, to draw up into the
-P-A-G-E-46
32 PSYCHOLOGY EG TEACHERS 
field of attention that part of the system of knowledge 
which bears upon the new facts or principles which he 
proposes to introduce or present. Then they may be 
clearly understood, because the relational ground has been 
prepared; then they may prove interesting, because their 
significance will be adequately grasped ; then the system of 
knowledge will be extended and strengthened, and made 
ready for application to further examples as illustrations 
of the principles which have been established. 
But after all, this immediate preparation of the field of 
consciousness depends on a great deal of previous prepar- 
ation of preceding fields of consciousness, Education 
should be a continuous and systematic process, by which 
the mind is prepared for further development, always with 
a view to the application of the knowledge thus gained to 
some definite purpose, either in dealing with the situations 
of daily life or in attainment of wider and more exact 
knowledge. We may therefore say that preparation is 
always the educational means; application is always the 
educational end. 
If we consider the matter in a yet broader and more 
general way, applying the term education not only to the 
special ministry of the teacher, but to the learning of the 
lessons of life from the cradle onwards, still we shall find 
that preparation is essential to application, and that appli- 
cation in itself constantly affords a preparation for nicer, 
more delicate, more exact and wider application. The 
infant comes into the world with certain inherited disposi- 
tions. What shall we understand by the word “ disposi- 
tions” thus used? I think we must understand that the 
child inherits a nervous system, the functional parts of 
which are so disposed or arranged that when certain sen- 
sory nerve-endings are stimulated by presentations from 
the environment, there follow certain more or less definite
-P-A-G-E-47
PREPARATION AND APPLICATION 33 
modes of responsive behaviour. If, for example, you place 
your finger in the palm of a newly born child, the little 
hand will close on it and grasp it firmly. But what is 
this but an application of the vital energies? And does 
it not depend on racial preparation, which is transmitted to 
the infant through heredity? The inherited disposition 
is at the outset a physiological disposition. As we watch 
the infant during its first weeks of life we observe many 
apparently random, but really more or less adaptive move- 
ments which are varied forms of instinctive application in 
response to sensory presentations. Here is the raw material 
of behaviour. And here, too, is the raw material of experi- 
ence. It is probable that experience itself is not inherited. 
What is inherited is a bodily organisation and a nervous 
system, the functional working of which gives rise not only 
to behaviour, but also to states of consciousness. If we 
assume that the child is conscious of its earliest forms of 
behaviour, then the sensory presentations and the result- 
ing responses combine to form a dim awareness of the 
situation as developing on hereditary lines. The physio- 
logical disposition in action gives rise to a psychological 
disposition in consciousness. This disposition involves an 
awareness of the presented environment, and of the be- 
haviour adapted thereto, and it constitutes a bit of what 
we may term the primordial tissue of experience. Now 
the energy of the response in behaviour varies with the 
organisation and sensitiveness of the total disposition, and 
on the strength and efficiency of the presentation therein. 
If we apply the term impulse to this variable dynamic 
factor, then we may say that the energy of the response 
varies with the strength of the impulse. 
The last paragraph will probably present difficulties 
to the reader who is ignorant of the physiology of the 
nervous system, and who has not had occasion to consider
-P-A-G-E-48
  84 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
the relation between physiological changes and states of 
consciousness. Although but little can be said in a short 
space that is helpful—that little consisting of mere in- 
formation—a few salient points may here be given. In 
the first place we all know that conscious experience is in 
some way connected with the brain. The exact nature of 
the connection is not known. We must be content to 
accept as a working hypothesis that it is an accompani- 
ment—or in technical phrase a concomitant—of the func- 
tional activity of the outer layer or cortex of the cerebral 
hemispheres which occupy the upper part of the skull 
cavity. 
To the brain, or its continuation in the spinal cord, which 
runs down the back within the arches of the vertebre there 
course inwards from all parts of the body a vast number of 
delicate nerve-threads, which are collected in larger strands 
termed the afferent nerves. They are the channels of com- 
munication which carry inwards what we may call nerve- 
currents from the organs of special sense—from eye, nose, 
tongue, ear, and skin—from the internal viscera, and from 
the parts concerned in bodily movement. Unless or until 
these currents reach the cortex of the brain there are pro- 
bably no conscious concomitants. The changes are purely 
physiological. Other nerves run forth from the brain or 
spinal cord (which are together spoken of as the central 
nervous system) and carry outwards the currents which 
cause the muscles to contract, the glands to secrete, and 
the blood-vessels to dilate or the reverse. These are 
termed the efferent nerves. After the currents have left 
the cortex they are (we assume) outside the sphere of con- 
scious concomitance. If we are aware that our muscles | / 
are contracting, our salivary glands secreting, or our 
blood-vessels tingling, this is because afferent currents are 
ranning inwards from these parts to the cortex and setting
-P-A-G-E-49
PREPARATION AND APPLICATION 35 
up changes which are accompanied by these modes of con- 
sciousness. We cannot enter further into details, which 
would indeed be unnecessary for our present purpose. 
But it should be clearly grasped that there are two sets 
of nerves, indistinguishable in appearance but distinct in 
function, the one set afferent, carrying in currents to the 
central nervous system, and the other set efferent, carry- 
ing out other currents from the nerve-centres. The 
currents in the one set always flow inwards, those in the 
other set always flow outwards. And it is only the in- 
ward-flowing currents which, if they reach certain parts 
of the brain, set up changes the conscious concomitants of 
which contribute to experience. 
Now let us consider one or two examples which may 
serve to illustrate the working of the mechanism. If, to 
take the instance above given, you place your finger gently 
in the half-open hand of a sleeping child, the little fingers 
will close over it and clasp it lightly. The touch of your 
finger on the palm affords what is termed a stimulus to 
the sensitive structures to which the end-threads of 
certain afferent nerves are distributed. Nerve-currents 
course inwards to centres in the spinal cord between the 
shoulders, throwing them into functional activity; and 
from these centres currents course outwards, by efferent 
nerves, to the muscles of the hand, causing them to con- 
tract in the orderly fashion necessary for grasping. The 
child still remains asleep, probably is unconscious of either 
the touch or the responsive movement. The currents 
either do not reach the cortex or stimulate it so slightly 
as not to call forth those brain-processes which accompany 
attention. None the less the bodily response is the quite 
definite one which we call grasping the finger. 
Let us now take a second case. In the reptile house at 
the Zoological Gardens I watched, through the plate-glass, 
 
-P-A-G-E-50
36 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
a cobra with expanded hood. Suddenly, as I had expected 
(since the attitude of the snake had meaning for me), it 
struck violently towards me against the glass; and I 
started back. The rapid movement of the cobra stimu- 
lated the retinas of my eyes: nerve-currents coursed in- 
wards and set up a disturbance in nerve-centres at the 
base of my brain; efferent currents coursed outwards to 
the muscles of my neck and limbs, causing me (that is my 
body) to start backwards. I did not intend to withdraw 
my face from near the glass. Indeed, I knew perfectly 
well that the cobra could not possibly reach me. I expected 
it to strike, and intended (if possible) not to start. But 
the direct response to stimulation was swift beyond con- 
trol. Still, and here this case differs from the last, I was 
fully conscious not only of seeing the cobra strike, but 
also of my own responsive movement. Nerve-currents 
went up to my cerebral cortex and set up a disturbance 
there which had vivid concomitants in consciousness. But 
the disturbed lower centres sent out those currents which 
made my muscles work, so rapidly that restraining cur- 
rents from the cortex could not check the involuntary 
recoil. And what passed through the mind a moment 
afterwards may be expressed in the words: “Hullo! I’ve 
done it after all”” But it was rather my body that had 
done it than the thinking part of me, which did not even 
consent. 
These two cases show us that there are certain in- 
voluntary and automatic responses which are carried out 
by the body, independently of conscious guidance and 
control. But it may be said that though the sleeping 
child may not consciously guide its fingers in the act of 
grasping, still it could not close its hand in this definite 
way unless it had learnt to grasp. That, however, is not 
so; for the newly born child will grasp and cling to your
-P-A-G-E-51
  PREPARATION AND APPLICATION 37 
fingers so firmly that it may be lifted from the bed. And 
the newly born child has had no opportunities of learning 
how to grasp. 
Among the lower animals, and in a less degree in the 
human infant, there are a number of responses which 
are carried out without learning or practice, the first 
time the appropriate stimuli occur. This kind of be- 
haviour, which is prior to any experience of its results, 
is involuntary, and is dependent on an inherited organic 
mechanism. When it rises to a certain level of complexity 
it is termed instinctive. Thus the newly hatched chick 
pecks at grains of food or other small things within strik- 
ing distance; when part of the body is irritated the little 
bird scratches at the spot; it has not to learn how to 
peck so as to seize the grains, nor where to scratch so 
as to allay the irritation. Soon after it emerges from the 
shell a young moorhen or duckling will, if it be placed 
in water, swim with orderly strokes. The small birds 
have not to be taught how to perform these acts, or to 
learn how to do them as we learn to ride a bicycle— 
the organic mechanism is inherited, its working is in- 
voluntary and the actions are instinctive; that is to 
say, they are not dependent on previous individual 
experience. 
The important point, then, for us to notice, if we would 
understand the beginnings of mental life in the individual 
animal or child, is this: that at the start of life it 
behaves involuntarily in certain ways because it inherits 
the appropriate mechanism. It commences the business 
of life as.a going concern, to which as an organism it is 
heir. And through its instinctive behaviour ready- 
grouped data are afforded to consciousness as a basis for 
experience. Granted that the duckling swims involun- 
tarily, just because, as a water-bird, it is so built, through
-P-A-G-E-52
38 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
heredity, that the stimuli afforded by partial immersion 
inevitably start this particular and appropriate behaviour ; 
and granted that it is conscious, that is to say capable, of 
acquiring experience; then that which is presented to con- 
sciousness is what we may term an “ instinctive situation ” 
developing in certain predetermined ways; and this as a 
whole is a bit of experience that is capable of further 
development. The sight of water thereafter has meaning; 
experience has taught the little bird that water is some- 
thing to swim in. 
Let us now try and bring the facts which we have 
briefly reviewed with regard to involuntary and instinc- 
tive behaviour into line with the theme of this chapter. 
May we not say that, whatever biological hypothesis we 
may accept with regard to the origin and evolution of 
instinctive responses, they are the outcome of a prolonged 
process of racial preparation for the particular activities 
which find their proper application in responses adapted 
to the circumstances of the case? The instinctive situa- 
tion affords a presentation. The application follows in- 
voluntarily because of the foregoing racial preparation 
of the organic mechanism for its appropriate mode of 
working. The duckling comes into the world specially 
prepared through heredity for certain modes of response; 
when it is partially immersed in water an instinctive 
situation is presented; and the result of this presentation 
is the peculiar application of its hereditary power of 
swimming. We have to remember, then, that the newly 
born infant is the embodiment of a large amount of 
organic preparation, and that its earliest activities are the 
application of its instinctive dower, at the bidding of 
certain presented stimuli. 
We may now pass on to consider very briefly a simple 
case, which may help us to distinguish truly instinctive
-P-A-G-E-53
PREPARATION AND APPLICATION 39 
behaviour from intelligent behaviour, due to the individual 
acquisition of experience. Young chicks, hatched in an in- 
cubator, will peck instinctively at small things within 
reach. Here we have automatic behaviour directly due 
to the working of inherited nervous mechanism. But 
suppose we give them some ladybirds. They will peck at 
these insects as they peck at other small things. There 
is no sign of any inherited experience of the fact which 
the first trial at once discloses, namely, that the ladybird 
is nauseous or distasteful. But after a few trials, some- 
times after a single trial, the chick will cease to peck at 
jadybirds. It has learnt one of the lessons of experience, 
and learnt it surely and rapidly. Some caterpillars are 
nice (from the chick’s point of view) ; others are nasty. 
All alike are seized at first. Soon the nice ones are 
selected, the nasty ones rejected. Inherited tendencies 
lead the chick to peck at and seize any small things in 
response to visual stimuli; but experience gives the 
visual impressions meaning in terms of the results, 
pleasurable or the reverse, of the originally instinctive 
behaviour, which affords the opportunities of learning. 
The sight of a ladybird, or yellow-and-black cinnabar 
caterpillar, means unpleasant results; that of a small 
white maggot or brown looper caterpillar means satis- 
faction. In the former cases pecking is restrained; in 
the latter, it is carried out with added zest. We call the 
bird which can thus profit by its experience, intelligent. 
The instinctive response depends entirely on how the 
nervous mechanism has been built up through heredity ; 
intelligent behaviour depends also on how the nervous 
mechanism has been modified and moulded by use during 
its development, and concurrently with the growth of 
individual experience in the customary situations of daily 
life. The intelligent act is a voluntary one, because it
-P-A-G-E-54
40 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
depends on the individual choice of the experienced little 
bird. 
But what is this experience but a further form of 
preparation for that kind of behaviour which I here call 
intelligent? The fact that a situation has meaning in 
terms of what previous behaviour has disclosed is an 
indication that the child or animal is prepared to deal 
with it in accordance with this meaning. But the pre- 
paration in this case is a matter of the child’s own 
experience. A child who has learnt that a brown object 
which we call a stick of chocolate is nice, is prepared to 
apply his activities to the taking and munching of it. 
There are incoming nerve-currents, a disturbance of the 
lower brain-centres, and out-going nerve-currents. But 
the taking of the chocolate is probably dependent on 
some specific manner of preparation of the cortex con- 
comitant with the previous experience. 
Now in any case of intelligent behaviour dependent 
upon the preparation afforded by individual experience 
the presentative impressions are assimilated. That is im- 
plied when we say that sights and sounds acquire mean- 
ing for the child. The sight of his ball has meaning 
because he has already played with it in sundry ways. 
And when he is taken into a neighbour’s nursery the 
sight of a different ball there is assimilated to his previous 
experience of such objects. In every case of intelligent 
behaviour initiated by sensory impressions within a given 
situation, we have a general formula which covers the 
facts of the case: Preparation; Presentation; Assimila- 
tion; Application. In all education which deals with 
practical experience there is preparation of such a kind 
that the presentations to the organs of sense may be so 
assimilated as to lead to the appropriate application of 
the mental and vital energies in some form of behaviour.
-P-A-G-E-55
PREPARATION AND APPLICATION 41 
A distinguishing feature of intelligent guidance, due to 
individual preparation in the course of experience, is that 
it is selective in its nature. Now, in order to select, 
there must be material from which to select. This, so 
far as behaviour is concerned, is, at the outset of life, 
afforded by the great wealth and variety of the inherited 
modes of response. There is, to begin with, an over- 
production of movements, and from these the effective 
movements are selected, through the checking or inhibi- 
tion of those which are redundant or ineffective. It is 
only gradually, for example, that the child learns to 
stretch out and grasp an object. At first the attempts 
are ineffective, notwithstanding the inherited grasping 
instinct when the fingers or the palm of the hand are 
stimulated. There is plenty of response, but much of it 
is ill-directed. Step by step, however, the surplusage of 
activity is inhibited; only the essential movements 
remain. Orderly adaptive behaviour is reached by the 
elimination of the non-adaptive redundancy. The same 
kind of thing is seen at a later stage of life. Years ago 
I taught country lads in a night school. When one of 
them was learning to write there was hardly a muscle in 
his body that was not at work. His foot was hooked 
round the leg of his chair; his shoulders were set and 
strained; his head was screwed on one side; his tongue 
thrust into his cheek. Over-production of active response 
was exemplified throughout his whole frame. Selection 
of the essentials is reached by the elimination of all this 
redundancy until only the business part of actual writing 
remains., That is part of the secret of skill. It looks so 
easy and'so graceful just because all but the essentials have 
been got rid of. There was very much over-production to 
begin with. In most forms of awkwardness much remains 5 
as may be seen on the cricket-field or the golf-links,
-P-A-G-E-56
42 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
That is one mode in which intelligent selection is 
exercised. Now, take the proverbial case of the burnt 
child avoiding fire. He has learnt to reach out and grasp 
with the hand, and applies this kind of behaviour in order 
to get that alluring bright object. But his fingers are 
burnt. Seeing, reaching, grasping, and being hurt, consti- 
tute one bit of experience—one situation for consciousness, 
one disposition in consciousness. On a_ subsequent 
occasion the sight of that or a similar bright object 
revives the whole situation; but the situation was un- 
pleasant; the disposition contains an impulse to aversion ; 
and the stretching out and grasping is inhibited. Just 
how this is effected it is not easy to explain on physio- 
logical grounds; and no attempt at explanation will here 
be made; but such facts are familiar enough. The 
presentation to sight when a glowing ember is again seen 
is assimilated to the previous experience of the fire- 
situation. On the other hand, when the child sees a 
chocolate-drop, his impulse to grasp, take, and eat is not 
checked or inhibited. That is a quite different situation. 
Its development on previous occasions was eminently 
satisfactory, and the behaviour under these circumstances 
takes its place in the selected and not the rejected 
category. 
It is unnecessary to exemplify further the way in 
which the child learns to deal selectively with the diverse 
situations of its daily life. Behaviour entails experience ; 
and according as this experience is pleasant or the reverse, 
it tends in future to be repeated or to be held in check. 
Intelligent selective dispositions are formed. From our 
present point of view, what I wish to make clear is that 
every kind of behaviour is a form of application, and that 
it always presupposes a form of preparation. What the 
child inherits is one kind of preparation, which I have
-P-A-G-E-57
PREPARATION AND APPLICATION 43 
termed racial; what the child acquires in the course of 
his own experience is a further kind of preparation, which 
may be termed individual. It is to this latter kind that 
the teacher can minister in various ways; but since it is 
so largely dependent on the natural capacities of the child, 
something further must be said on the child’s hereditary 
dower. 
First of all, as we have seen, the child inherits a 
capacity of behaving automatically and instinctively in 
certain ways when it gets the right kind of stimulus or 
presentation. Secondly, it inherits a capacity of feeling 
or experiencing both the presentation and the resulting 
behaviour. Thirdly, it inherits a capacity of being. 
affected in other ways by the presentation. The heart- 
beat, respiration, circulation, may be increased or dimin- 
ished; other internal organs may be affected, giving rise 
to organic impressions. Fourthly, it inherits a capacity of 
feeling or experiencing this also. Fifthly, it inherits 
sundry likings and dislikings, or the capacity of getting 
pleasure or satisfaction out of certain kinds of experience, 
and of feeling pain or discomfort from other kinds of 
experience. Sixthly, it inherits a capacity of assimilating 
new experience to old, and hence a capacity of mental 
development. Lastly, it inherits a capacity of profiting 
by experience; of inhibiting or checking certain forms of 
behaviour, leaving other forms to be carried out with 
increased nicety and vigour. 
All of this inherited capacity is part of the child’s 
natural dower. It is the outcome of racial preparation ; 
it has been handed down as a legacy from the child’s 
ancestors. But it will be said, this covers pretty nearly, 
if not quite, the whole field. All that the child does 
actually become, in the course of his physical and mental 
development, he has, through inheritance, the capacity of
-P-A-G-E-58
44 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
becoming. That is so. But some of the behaviour is 
wholly due to racial preparation; the acts are performed 
before there is any experience; their performance affords 
what I called above the primordial tissue of experience. 
Other kinds of behaviour, those which we termed in- 
telligent, are selected as the result or outcome of previous 
experience. They are not wholly due to racial preparation, 
but also partly due to individual preparation. That is 
what we mean by saying that the burnt child dreads fire. 
The boy inherits a capacity for riding a bicycle, otherwise 
he could never do so. But he has to learn to ride none 
the less. Individual experience is a condition without 
which the inherited capacity can not take effect. 
Training and education are the means by which children 
and older pupils are helped to obtain the individual 
preparation which is the necessary condition of effective 
application of the bodily and mental energies. 
The varied forms of application are classified by 
psychologists under that aspect of the mental life which 
is distinguished as conation. The varied forms of 
presentation belong to the cognitive aspect. The varied 
forms of satisfaction and emotion fall under the affective 
aspect. These three are so closely related as to be 
practically inseparable, though one or other may carry the 
predominant emphasis. Let us consider how they are 
related. 
We have then to inquire how what are termed in 
popular speech, knowing, feeling, and doing are related to 
each other. Let us, however, pause for a moment to 
remove some ambiguities which may arise out of the use 
of terms. The word “ feeling” is used in three seemingly 
different senses. First, it may be used in a very wide and 
comprehensive sense for almost any mode of conscious 
experience; we feel hungry, depressed, uncomfortable, or
-P-A-G-E-59
PREPARATION AND APPLICATION 45 
at ease; we feel the several kinds of impressions just in 
so far as they are presented in our experience; we have 
feelings of effort, striving, or endeavour. Secondly, we 
have the use of the word when it is restricted to impres- 
sions of touch; we feel the roughness of an object by 
applying to it our fingers; we feel for the box of matches 
on the mantelshelf in a dark room. Thirdly, we have the 
use implied in the distinction between knowing, feeling, 
and doing, the use which suggests the pleasurable or 
painful affective tone which gives colour to our experience. 
The context will generally show in which of these senses 
the word is used. Here we deal with such feelings as 
those of pleasure or of pain. But the word “ pain” may 
also be ambiguous. It is employed, first, for some form of 
bodily injury or strain, when, for example, we speak of 
the pain of a bruise, a cut, or a toothache. Since there 
are probably special nerves and nerve-endings which are 
directly stimulated in such cases, pain, in this use of the 
word, is a sensation, and contributes to our impressions. 
Secondly, the word is used for a special quality of the 
affective tone or feeling. In this sense it is the antithesis 
of the diffused feeling of pleasure. Thus we speak of 
states of suspense or of anxiety as painful. It has been — 
suggested that we should employ the term “ displeasure,” 
in a technical sense, as the antithesis of pleasure; but the 
ordinary implications of the word may thus lead to an 
ambiguity as great as that which we seek to avoid; and 
we may use the words “pain” and “painful” without 
much risk of being misunderstood, if we bear in mind 
that, thus employed, they do not necessarily imply any 
injury to the organs or tissues of the body. 
Having made allowance for these ambiguities, two 
questions arise. First, granting that pleasure and pain 
are antithetical modes of affective tone which may accom-
-P-A-G-E-60
46 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
pany any kind of experience, are there any other forms? 
What about the feeling of excitement, of which we are 
sometimes unable to say whether it is pleasurable or 
painful? It is no doubt partly due to somewhat 
indefinite organic impressions which come tingling in 
from various parts of our bodily organisation; it is 
accompanied by a toning up of the muscles. But it 
seems to carry with it emotional feeling. If so, is it a 
wholly different form of feeling, or is it a compound of 
pleasure and pain in such nicely-balanced proportion that 
neither preponderates? The discussion of this question 
would involve a close analysis, which would here be out 
of place. As a matter of direct experience, and for 
practical purposes, excitement, however constituted, does 
seem to have the same kind of reference to our personal 
feelings as pleasure and pain. Secondly, are there any 
really neutral states which are neither pleasurable nor 
painful, which involve no tinge of either excitement or 
depression, no trace of tension or relief—in a word, no 
accompaniment of that personal reference which seems 
to be a characteristic of feeling? The more speculative 
aspect of this question, too, we may disregard. It suffices 
for us to observe that what we notice is a change in the 
level of feeling either towards a more pleasurable or a 
more excited state, or in the opposite direction. Thus 
the same state of consciousness may be relatively 
pleasurable or painful in contrast with that which has 
preceded it. And if, as appears to be often the case, 
any noticeable change of level is absent, a uniform 
plane of affective tone being maintained, it seems to be 
neutral—not, however, from absence of feeling, but from 
absence of change of feeling. | 
Now it is a generally recognised fact that the state 
of feeling, whether of pleasure or pain, excitement or
-P-A-G-E-61
PREPARATION AND APPLICATION 47 
depression, markedly influences the application of mental 
energy. specially are upward changes, within due 
limits, conducive to satisfactory and effective doing. 
Assimilation is more vigorous; presentations have more 
serviceable meaning. A due preparation of the field of 
consciousness in its feeling aspect, the establishment of a 
full and rich affective tone, is a condition of efficient 
mental activity. 
This opens up the further question with regard to the 
part played by this affective tone in furthering applica- 
tion—or, if the feeling be depressing and painful, 
hindering it. Feeling is commonly regarded by most of 
us as affording an affective link between knowing on the 
one hand and doing on the other. We say, for example, 
that the sight of an object evokes a feeling of interest, 
and that this leads to the application of attention to 
it, and then perhaps from added interest to active 
manipulation of the object for some specific purpose. 
Here, feeling seems to be a middle term between cognition 
on the one hand and the conation implied in active 
behaviour on the other hand. Even when some topic 
which we are studying, in itself evokes little or no 
interest, and is pursued for some ulterior aim, let us 
say for examinational purposes, even here, it may be 
urged that the pleasures of anticipated success, of 
conquering difficulties, of self-mastery, of overcoming the 
irksomeness of the task, afford the middle term leading 
to continued efforts to attain success. We are inclined 
to think, perhaps, that this account of the matter is 
somewhat strained, for after all the task is irksome; but 
shall we, can we, persist in it if the motives for its 
continuance are not in an adequate degree supplemented 
by feelings either of pleasure or of excitement? 
Exercise may either produce a pleasurable feeling of
-P-A-G-E-62
48 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
exhilaration which leads to its continuance, or a painful 
feeling of fatigue which brings about its cessation. But 
towards the close of a long race the continuance of the 
exertion may cause distress, and yet we doggedly put 
forth our best endeavours. In this case it may be 
said that excitement supplies the middle term of feeling. 
A review of some of the common situations of our daily 
life will enable us to understand what is meant by those 
who say that, between the presentations to sense or to 
thought, and the resulting behaviour or conduct, practical 
or intellectual, some form of feeling occupies the position 
of middle term. It is one thing, however, to say that 
affective tone is an accompaniment of or even a 
necessary condition to continued application; and 
another thing to contend that it is a sort of connecting 
link in which all the affective tone is concentrated, 
leaving the presentation and the application emotionally 
colourless. 
Another way of putting the matter is this: What takes 
place in ordinary life-situations is a passage from an objec- 
tive aspect in cognition, through a subjective aspect in 
feeling, to some change in the objective aspect through our 
own acts. Thus on seeing a picture hanging awry (know- 
ing), we feel dissatisfied with its position (feeling) and set 
it straight (doing). A problem in geometry is presented to 
us (cognition) ; it arouses our interest (affective tone), and 
we apply ourselves to its solution, endeavouring to solve 
it (conation). We must, however, clearly understand the 
terms objective and subjective. Any bit of experience has 
what is sometimes termed a dual reference—an objective 
reference to that with which the experience deals; a sub- 
jective reference to the person who feels or has the experi- 
ence. In a sense the problem of geometry as it stands is 
impersonal ; there it is for you, me, or someone else to tackle ;
-P-A-G-E-63
PREPARATION AND APPLICATION 49 
it is independent of us severally. So, too, the solution 
of the problem; the result of our work when our end is 
achieved is in a sense, as it stands, impersonal; there it is 
for you or others to criticise it, admire it, or pick holes in 
it. But the interest I feel in it and its solution is personal. 
It is my own interest, and has reference to me as a sub- 
ject, who feels the interest. What I have here spoken of 
as impersonal—that with which the experience deals—is 
objective. That which I have spoken of as personal—the 
affective tone of my experience of it—is subjective. It 
will perhaps be said that the understanding of the problem 
is also mine; mine, too, its solution. That is the very 
point to which I desire to lead up. Any bit of experience 
is really one and indivisible; it is a comprehensive unity. 
Only by analysis do we distinguish the objective reference 
from the subjective reference. Hence I spoke of cognition, 
affective tone, and conation as “aspects” of the mental 
life. And that is why it seems unsatisfactory to regard one 
of these aspects as a link between the other two. Is it not 
better to hold fast to the oneness of experience, and to say 
that in any piece of experience as a whole we may distin- 
guish, though we cannot separate, an objective reference to 
that with which it deals, and a subjective reference to what 
it feels like to have the experience? It is in view of this 
latter reference that we speak of affective tone. Now this 
affective tone is such a personal and individual matter to 
each child, that the teacher cannot get at it directly. He 
can, however, help the child in the more impersonal know- 
ing and doing in their objective aspect; and thus he can 
indirectly minister to the development of affective tone 
(interest and so forth)—just because of the oneness of 
experience. 
There is one more characteristic feature about the feel- 
ings which must be noticed. After what has been said
-P-A-G-E-64
  50 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
above it will at first seem paradoxical. In naive, natural, 
unsophisticated experience, and especially in its earlier and 
simpler phases of development, the feelings, important as 
they are as factors in the field of consciousness as a whole, 
lie for the most part in the background, and do not occupy 
the field of attention. /Knowing and doing occupy the 
attention; feeling and affective tone are supplementary.) 
When we are quite naturally interested in a topic, and 
feel a pleasurable excitement, we do not normally attend 
to the interest, pleasure, or excitement. We attend to the 
problem before us, and to the work we are doing upon it. 
We constantly tell the child to attend to what he is looking 
at, or what we are saying, or what he is doing; we do not 
urge him to attend to what he is feeling. This may seem 
paradoxical after what has been said above as to the 
personal reference of the affective tone; for to refer them 
to oneself as subject implies that we are attending to them. 
The point is, that we only attend to them in order to gain 
some knowledge of their nature on reviewing our experience 
afterwards ; then we find that they were in the background 
of our consciousness in unsophisticated experience. But 
only when that experience is reviewed, analysed, and 
grouped in accordance with the dual reference, from the 
standpoint of systematic treatment, do we discover their 
essentially personal nature. Children, and indeed most of 
us, in the course of daily experience, do not distinguish 
self and not self. That only comes when we begin system- 
atically to think about our experience. 
Among the states of consciousness in which we find that 
the personal subjective reference was emphatic, when we 
come to review it and think about it reflectively, are the 
emotions. Certain presentations call them into being. 
These are generally cumulative, and arise out of the devel- 
opment of a situation. The disposition is also cumulative,
-P-A-G-E-65
PREPARATION AND APPLICATION 51 
and its impulsive tendency grows in strength. There is thus 
a certain amount of preparation before the emotional state 
reaches a climax. The outcome is a remarkably vigorous 
and forcible application of the energies of behaviour. But 
there is something more to characterise the state of con- 
sciousness as emotional. There is a strong supplement of 
feeling, which may be pleasurable or painful, but is largely 
of the order of excitement. This is the accompaniment of 
a great number of peculiarly massive organic impressions, 
by no means easy to analyse. No doubt there is some 
divergency in the answers which may be given to the ques- 
tion: What is an emotion? Let me therefore at once say 
that in any state which I myself regard as emotional, 
whether it is due to uncanny sounds heard at dead of night, 
intense and absorbing interest, anger due to real or fancied 
injury, depression from failure or elation at success; when 
I am touched by pity, annoyed at stupidity, stirred by a 
great poem er picture, or moved by grand music; in all 
cases one of the characteristics is that my blood tingles, or 
my heart-stroke is affected, er my respiration altered, or 
queer sensations arise below-the diaphragm. These vary, 
no doubt, in different cases; but unless I am conscious of 
one or more of these, there is not present what, as the out- 
come of my own experience and the use of terms I adopt, 
I should call-an emotien. It may be said that these are 
the erganic effects of the emotion, just as the expression in 
facial play, the clenched hands and set teeth of anger, the 
shrinking and crouching of fear, the limpness of depres- 
sion, and the heightened muscular tone of elation (when 
one holds one’s head high) are its effects on the motor sys- 
tem. But to separate them off as effects from the emotion 
itself as their cause, involves a subtle and somewhat ques- 
tionable piece of analysis. Of the emotions actually felt, the 
diffused erganic impressions and their affective tone seem 
 
-P-A-G-E-66
    52 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
to be characteristic factors. To regard them as effects 
seems to leave the emotion itself tame and colourless. 
Some psychologists, notably Professor Wm. James of 
Harvard and Professor C. Lange of Copenhagen, have gone 
so far in the opposite direction as to contend that the 
organic impressions and the active responses in behaviour 
are not only characteristic factors of an emotion but the 
sole factors. To a large extent the question turns on 
definition, and the emotions are hard to define. Of course 
if we say that they are not only characterised by the 
presence of certain reverberations throughout the bodily 
system, and certain specific modes of expression in be- 
haviour, but that these are, by our definition, the sole 
constituents, there is an end of the matter. Other factors 
are by definition excluded. But if we regard an emotion 
as the subjective and affective aspect of a complex state 
of consciousness as a whole—a state of consciousness 
which has also objective reference to some person or 
thing which for cognition carries meaning and begets 
expectation—then the James-Lange view appears to be 
inadequate. s 
In any case, from our present standpoint the emotion 
is full of affective tone; often some form of excitement, 
pleasurable or painful perhaps, which is a condition of, 
or a preparation for, energetic and strenuous behaviour ; 
sometimes some form of depression, when behaviour is in- 
hibited, as in the state of collapse under extremity of fear. 
If we coolly reflect upon it, and analyse our states of con- 
sciousness when we were so angry, or so moved by pity, 
or so enthusiastic, we say that the affective tone, excite- 
ment or depression, pleasure or pain, is essentially sub- 
jective and personal in its reference.. It is what we felt 
as characteristically emotional. But at the moment of 
experience it was felt as a palpitating background; it was
-P-A-G-E-67
PREPARATION AND APPLICATION 53 
not then in the field of attention. The angry child is not 
thinking about his anger; the frightened child of his fear ; 
the attention is mainly, if not wholly, occupied with the 
objective reference, the person to be struck or from whom 
the child shrinks. In other words, the attention is directed 
to the development of the situation in some definite way. 
That, at any rate, is the naive, unsophisticated attitude. 
Of course there comes a stage at which the child does cast 
side glances of attention on its own feelings. But this is 
a product of reflection. The child is becoming self-con- 
scious. Whether it occurs in child or adult, such partial 
attention to the subjective and personal aspect of the 
emotional state is a departure from the perfectly frank and 
natural mode of dealing with the situation. Suppose, for 
example, I am standing before a great picture, and am 
deeply touched and stirred by its beauty and power. The 
more my attention is fixed upon the picture itself and what 
it suggests, the more straightforward and unsophisticated 
is my appreciation of its esthetic appeal. Directly I 
begin te analyse my ewn feelings I change my whole 
attitude. They may interest me, but it is a different 
interest. I am ne longer so deeply touched when I am 
thinking about the character of my emotion. At the 
moment of strong emotion we are not introspective. The 
tide of feeling is at the back of our consciousness, not 
in the foreground. 
x Hence in dealing with the emotions of children the less 
we refer to them the better. To bring about a change 
in the emotional state we must seek to change the objective 
situation, to divert the attention from those presentations 
which minister to an angry or sullen disposition, and 
towards other presentations which shall minister to a 
happier and less unsocial frame of: mind. The emotions 
of children and others are hard to influence directly; but
-P-A-G-E-68
  54 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
we can to some extent influence them indirectly, in so far 
as we can guide the attention-process. 
How does the attention-process begin? If when an 
infant, say a month old, is staring vacantly, something 
bright be introduced into the field of vision on one side, 
the eyes will turn towards it. A strong (but not too 
strong) impression in the margin of the visual field is a 
stimulus which produces a response such that the impres- 
sion is brought to the focus. This is an instinctive re- 
sponse. But it is on the lines of attention. It is the kind 
of raw material which the further developed attention- 
process incorporates. It is true that the behaviour is auto- 
matic, and depends on an inherited disposition. But if the 
child gains satisfaction by thus behaving, the successful 
responses will be selected and the child will begin to look 
round him with spontaneous attention; and, sooner or 
later, as experience widens, with the interest that attaches 
to meaning. The sight of things comes to mean that they 
can be grasped, and otherwise manipulated. More than 
the impression is in the field of attention. It may occupy 
the focus, but the way in which the situation may be 
developed lies round it in the field of the attention-process 
as a whole. By spontaneous attention we are to under- 
stand the conative aspect of a disposition which has also 
an affective aspect, generally tinged with pleasurable tone; 
and this we term interest. 
As we have seen, spontaneous and intelligent attention 
implies the existence of those relationships which, for cog- 
nition, give the central impression some meaning or signi- 
ficance. Meaning for cognition (knowing), attention as a 
form of active conation (doing), and interest as affective 
tone (feeling), are only different aspects or modes of one 
and the same state of consciousness. The relationships in- 
volved depend upon the character and state of development
-P-A-G-E-69
PREPARATION AND APPLICATION 55 
of the mind. They depend upon previous preparation. 
By carefully noting what a child attends to, in what he 
is interested, and what meaning it conveys to his under- 
standing, we gain some insight into the kind and status 
of his mental quality. Attention is an expression of in- 
terest (so far as we can distinguish the two aspects), and 
interest implies that some meaning is conveyed. Hence 
it is said that interest is a form of self-expression. 
With little children the teacher has to employ all 
possible means to foster such spontaneous interest and 
attention as naturally arise out of the topic in hand. 
Lessons and learning must be made as pleasant as possible. 
That is a condition of the attention being spontaneous. 
But those who contend that, throughout the course of 
education, this and this only is the kind of attention they 
should seek to develop are, I conceive, in error. There 
comes a stage when a more important thing than spon- 
taneous attention is the will to attend. This is sometimes 
termed voluntary; but since the word is used with some 
variation of significance we will term it volitional. This 
implies an effort; it implies some motive for attending to 
this task, though it would be more pleasant to stray 
leisurely into that more alluring field of attention. This 
is the attention that has worth for the intellectual life, 
because of its significance for the development of systems 
of knowledge. This is the attention which betokens 
individuality and character. This is the attention which 
the teacher has to lead up to, along the pleasant avenue 
of spontaneous attention. 
I cannot hope at present to make the distinction between 
spontaneous and volitional attention clear and convincing. 
It must suffice to say that the will to attend involves 
considerations stretching out beyond the immediate situa- 
tion. That is implied by the term “motive.” A motive
-P-A-G-E-70
56 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
brings a particular situation into relation with a wider 
scheme of thought or conduct than is comprised within 
the immediate situation itself. Fortunately, continued 
application of the will renders further application more 
easy. This again falls into line with the doctrine of the 
importance of preparation. Which of us does not know 
by personal experience that it is the early stage of any 
new subject or fresh inquiry which demands a definite, 
and sometimes resolutely determined exercise of the will 
to attend? There must be some adequate motive; little 
satisfaction is gained in the performance of the task itself, 
but to do it has worth for the intellectual and moral life. 
In view of this worth, temptations to inattention (that is 
attention in other directions) must be inhibited. Some- 
times we cannot inhibit them, do what we will. But here 
habit and facilitation come to our aid. As we make pro- 
gress in our subject, or get into the swing of our inquiry, 
interest and the spontaneous type of attention increases. 
Why? Because the dispositions are becoming organised, 
because each new presented idea is brought into relation 
with a field which is larger and better prepared for its 
reception. More and more does volitional effort lapse; 
more and more pleasant and spontaneous is application; 
until at last, when we are thoroughly engrossed in our 
topic or inquiry, an effort is required to divert our atten- 
tion. We cannot easily put the matter on one side, so 
strong is the disposition to continue along the lines which 
facilitation has rendered those of pleasurable and spon- 
taneous flow of thought. 
If it be asked in what way we can best foster volitional 
attention—make ourselves, for example, attend to an un- 
inviting task, the answer is not easy to give. If, however, 
we remember that attention is a form of activity, that it 
is a mode of application, we may be led to find that the
-P-A-G-E-71
PREPARATION AND APPLICATION 57 
best practical means to employ, is to do work on the 
subject. Most of us find that our attention wanders when 
we are “reading up” a topic. And many of us find that 
to return again and again to the perusal of the text leaves 
us still incapable of fixing the attention. But if we set to 
work and write a brief digest of what has gone before, and 
then make notes of fresh points as we read, this definite 
application of our activities (rather than of our recep- 
tivities) affords the necessary facilitation—soon digest and 
notes may be laid aside. They have served their purpose. 
One more feature of the attention-process may be noted. 
The more natural and normal and spontaneous it is, the 
less, as a process, does it come into the field of attention. 
Even in the case of volitional attention, to worry about 
the attention itself or the lack of it, is not the best means 
to secure our end; nay, rather it is one of the chief sources 
of distraction. We have to think about the end, proxi- 
mate and remote, which is to be attained by and through 
the attention-process, rather than upon the process by and 
through which this end is to be attained. This is the 
means of preparation for effective mental application.
-P-A-G-E-72
CHAPTER III 
MEMORY AND ASSOCIATION 
We are all so familiar with some of the phenomena of 
memory, that at first sight it would seem quite easy to 
define the term and to assign the limits within which the 
memory-process occurs in our mental life. But it is by 
no means so easy as at first sight it appears. We have 
seen that the child comes into the world with an inherited 
disposition to grasp firmly with the hands if the palms be 
stimulated; and there are many such instinctive responses. 
Are these inherited dispositions cases of memory? Pro- 
fessor Hering says that they are. It is true that the 
behaviour is automatic. Still the nervous system and the 
tissues of the body retain the effects of what I have termed 
racial preparation. And such retention Professor Hering 
calls organic memory. If we are not prepared to accept 
this view, we are committed to the conclusion that physio- 
logical retention is not necessarily memory. We have also 
seen that as the result of experience the child learns to 
reach out and neatly pick up a small object; later on he 
may learn to ride a bicycle. On what are these acquired 
dispositions dependent? On the establishment and reten- 
tion of physiological connections. Again, as the result of 
experience the child learns to avoid certain things, and to 
inhibit certain actions which have previously, under like 
circumstances, entailed unpleasant results. He has learnt, 
58
-P-A-G-E-73
  
MEMORY AND ASSOCIATION 59 
too, that chocolate-drops, and ride-a-cock-horse on father’s 
knee, are satisfactory, and has acquired a disposition so 
to behave as to renew such experiences. But on what do 
these dispositions depend? On the establishment and 
retention of physiological connections. But if we are 
committed to the conclusion that physiological retention 
is not necessarily memory, it is clear that it is at least open 
to us to say that the burnt child may avoid fire without re- 
membering that he has scorched his fingers. And Professor 
Thorndike contends that simple perceptual behaviour need 
not, and probably does not, imply the presence of memory. 
It is not, after all, so easy to say what memory is. At 
any rate, for Professor Hering, who says that all organic 
retention is memory, and for Professor Thorndike, who 
contends that there may be much direct profiting by 
experience without any memory, the limits within which 
the word is used are very different. 
Let us now look at the matter from another standpoint, 
and take one or two cases drawn from common and familiar 
experience, and considered in the light of our ordinary use 
of words. When we read a sentence or a paragraph we 
retain in mind near its close the net result of what has 
been said throughout. In ordinary phrase we are said to 
remember the preceding part. But are remembrance and 
such retention quite the same thing? Probably some of 
us would say, yes; others, no. Some would say, to retain 
in mind is to remember; of course this is memory. But 
others might urge that to remember is to recall to mind, 
to bring back into consciousness something which was 
previously there but has gone; something of which we 
have to be reminded. Cautious people might reply: the 
answer to such a query entirely depends on how we define 
memory and remembrance. And this is just the question 
we are considering. Take now a different case. We are
-P-A-G-E-74
  60 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
out for a walk with two children, and see a bird which 
they were told a few days ago was a starling. One of 
them at once remembers its name; the other does not. 
But does either of them have to remember that it is a 
bird? In familiar speech we should probably say that 
they know that it is a bird, but may or may not remember 
that it is a starling. The question is whether we are to 
include such immediate “knowledge” under memory— 
_ again a question of definition. 
From these examples, first from the standpoint of scien- 
tific treatment, and next from that of popular usage, it 
seems clear that we must come to some definite under- 
standing as to what we are to include within, and what 
we are to exclude from, the sphere of memory. First, let 
us agree to exclude purely instinctive phenomena due to 
racial preparation. Secondly, let us agree to include only 
those mental processes which involve re-presentation of 
what has been presented in previous individual experi- 
ence. Thus we shall exclude retention within the field 
of consciousness of that which has not yet faded out of 
consciousness, as in the case of reading a paragraph. 
It may be said, however, that if this be not memory it 
is none the less closely connected with the memory-process. 
Unquestionably it is. Let us therefore briefly consider its 
nature, applying to it the term primary retention. It may 
be well to take a concrete case. A child to-day is given by 
his nurse a spoonful of medicine; takes it readily ; experi- 
ences its nasty taste, and turns away his head. This is one 
of the painful paragraphs in the book of life the child has 
to read.. What are its sentences? First, the spoon in the 
focus of a field of consciousness, including also the nurse, 
the room, and so forth; secondly, the succeeding behaviour 
in taking the spoon and supping the medicine under the 
same (or practically the same) surrounding conditions;
-P-A-G-E-75
MEMORY AND ASSOCIATION 61 
thirdly, the nasty taste of the medicine, again under the 
same conditions; and lastly, the resulting behaviour of 
aversion—circumstances as before. These four stages 
occur so rapidly that the first has not faded from con- 
sciousness before the last comes to complete the developing 
situation—and to complete it with energy and emphasis. 
That is what it has all led up to. That is the impulsive 
climax of the paragraph. All four coalesce into one dis- 
position, of which this is the final and crowning result. 
The constituent factors which thus unite to form one 
disposition are said to be associated. So far there is no 
memory, as we have agreed to define it. But what about 
to-morrow? The nurse comes, teaspoon in hand, repeat- 
ing the pretty baby phrases, and takes the child in her lap. 
The beginning of the previous situation is presented under 
much the same circumstances. The disposition as a whole 
is reinstated ; not necessary, however, the whole disposition © 
in its successive details. The net results of all that horrid 
teaspoon business are suggested, and, since the child has 
not yet learnt self-restraint, the behaviour of aversion, that 
which was before the climax of the little life-paragraph, 
follows decisively and with emphasis. Here we have 
memory as reinstatement. Note that we have not the 
seriatim recapitulation of the steps by which the disposi- 
tion was established. We have the coalescent net-results, 
with all the energy of behaviour drained off in the main 
channel of the. original emphatic child-protest, more 
eloquent than words. Memory as reinstatement is pro- 
bably never a complete recapitulation. Its value lies in 
getting the gist of the matter. And, paradoxical as it 
may sound, so far as there is time-reference at all, it is 
probably in such cases rather prospective than retrospec- 
tive. It involves expectancy rather than reminiscence. 
The primary value of practical experience is to enable its
-P-A-G-E-76
_————— 
J 62 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
possessor to do the next thing that comes to hand, and to 
do it surely and effectively. The past conditions under 
which we learnt our lesson do not so much concern us. 
Perhaps, however, it is safest to say that reinstatement 
involves an indefinite fringe of pastness and a more defi- 
nite fringe of expectancy. These are the germs from 
which the retrospection and anticipation of the later 
phases of the memory-process are developed. 
The child, then, starts life with certain physiological dis- 
positions to behave in hereditary instinctive ways. There 
are inherited nerve-connections, but not memory. The 
presentations and the application in behaviour are accom- 
panied by consciousness, and, through primary retention, 
give rise to psychological dispositions. But the instinctive 
procedure opens up situations the development of which 
may be satisfactory or the reverse. The results of this 
development, with its consequent appetition or aversion, 
coalesce through the association of the constituent factors 
into selective or intelligent dispositions to avoid certain 
painful developments, and to repeat others which have 
afforded pleasure. These are called up by presentations 
which serve to reinstate the disposition as a whole, that 
is to say, the net-result of all that has become coalescent 
through association. Hour by hour and day by day in 
the child’s early life fresh dispositions are acquired, and 
his intelligent behaviour increases in range and complexity. 
But how do the dispositions thus established persist? It 
is clear that they are in some way retained. And there 
can be little doubt that it is a physiological retention 
in the nervous system. Let us term this secondary reten- 
tion. It seems to be a retention of the conditions under 
which the psychological disposition may be reinstated. 
An analogy may here be helpful. When we speak into 
a phonograph the effects of our voice are registered on
-P-A-G-E-77
  MEMORY AND ASSOCIATION 63 
the cylinder of the instrument, and are thus retained in 
such a way that the tones can be reproduced at a sub- 
sequent time. The sounds themselves are not retained; 
but the conditions of their reproduction are established. 
This analogy may help us to understand the kind of way 
in which, though a psychological disposition, with its con- 
stituent impressions, cannot be retained as such in the 
brain, the conditions of its reproduction may be impressed. 
on the brain tissue. If this be so there are two physio- 
logical pre-requisites of memory. First, some kind of 
registration of the connections established so as to link 
the disposition into a revivable whole (physiological asso- 
ciation) ; and next, the secondary retention, without which 
there would be no such thing as mental development. 
It is comparatively easy to understand the way in 
which an isolated disposition, such as that of the medicine 
situation, may be established, retained, and reinstated. It 
is much more difficult fully to grasp how the great number 
of overlapping and variously related dispositions gradu- 
ally combine to form one consistent and unified body of 
experience. It is probable that this does not take place 
for some time. It is probable that reinstating memory 
in the child is developed at first in a number of isolated 
patches, with only slight connection. Only when the uni- 
fication has reached a certain level do we begin to have 
one memory instead of a lot of independent memories. 
Perhaps the fact that for most of us there is no remem- 
brance of anything that occurs before the age of from 
two to two and a half years, may justify us in suppos- 
ing that the unification has not been carried far or 
rendered serviceable before that time. Be that as it may, 
our waking cradle hours and nursery days are mainly 
spent in weaving patches of that web which shall connect 
into one working tissue the data of the various senses.
-P-A-G-E-78
  64 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
Without the formation of association links the process of 
correlation of these data into effective dispositions could 
not take place, nor could such correlation be a guide to 
the further, fuller, and more accurate co-ordination of the 
muscular activities concerned in practical behaviour (see 
p- 96). In a word, without the connecting strands of 
association there would be no profiting by experience— 
nor indeed any experience by which to profit. Were 
the child to scald his tongue with hot porridge fifty times 
in succession, of what avail would it be to him if the 
sight of the steaming stuff did not reinstate the disposi- 
tion which restrains him from eating it under these cir- 
cumstances? And yet the child learns to wait and eat it 
when it is cooler. His growing experience enables him 
to adapt his behaviour to more subtle niceties of pre- 
sentation. 
And when we pass from the nursery into a larger 
world, with constantly widening horizon, the same kind 
of weaving, though that of a mere intricate and complex 
web, always through direct and first-hand experience, is 
our constant guide. Not only are more dispositions 
formed; but they are more closely inter-related, form a 
more unified body of experience. All our practical ac- 
quaintance with the nature of things, with their effects 
on each other and on ourselves, in their mutual actions 
and reactions, and in their relations to our instinctive or 
spontaneous behaviour, the lessons we have to learn as to 
what we can do and what is beyond our powers—all this 
is rendered serviceable to us through association. Now 
if the nature of our conscious life were such as always to 
present wholly new situations—no phase of experience 
occurring twice—this association linkage would be of 
no practical service or value; for there must be the 
presentative recurrence of some portion of the woven web
-P-A-G-E-79
  MEMORY AND ASSOCIATION 65 
in order to afford the requisite conditions for the re- 
presentative occurrence of the wider area of the network 
of which it has formed a part. Being what it is, however, 
practical experience presents again and again substantially 
the same situations in much the same order of sequence. 
And association secures that, when the beginning of one 
of these situations is so presented, the rest is re-presenta- 
tively called up by the stirring of the brain processes 
which were the concomitants of the completion of anal- 
ogous situations. If, for example, a child is brought into 
the study of his father, who is a smoker, he will see his 
father strike a match, will hear the “ quick, sharp scratch,” 
will see the spurt of flame, and will smell the tobacco’s 
aroma. These will become associated. And when, on a 
subsequent occasion, the father takes up the box of matches 
all the rest of the developed situation will be suggested. 
And the represented completion will probably be rein- 
forced by the actual and presentative completion. The 
repetition of the original series will strengthen the associa- 
tions, and will render the revival in due sequence on a 
subsequent occasion more rapid and sure. 
The correlative of association is suggestion. With the 
sight of the matches a definite situation has been associated 
in a given field of experience; and the subsequent sight of 
the box, held by the father in such and such a way, 
suggests the rest of the match-situation. The items of the 
original experience are to some extent presented in suc- 
cession; but the re-presentation of the situation through 
suggestion may be relatively rapid, so as to appear simul- 
taneous. They coalesce into one disposition. Nor need 
the original order be strictly preserved: the more salient 
features of the situation may, so to speak, outrun or out- 
weigh the minor details. Thus re-presentation need not 
be, and seldom is, an exact copy of presentation. There is
-P-A-G-E-80
66 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
much telescoping and omission of unimportant stages. 
The essential features for practical behaviour receive the 
greater emphasis: the non-essentials may lapse or merely 
lurk in the margin of consciousness. 
We may take for granted, therefore, the great import- 
ance of association, and the suggestion it begets in the 
establishment of experience which is practically serviceable 
to the child. And it is a purely individual matter. Each 
of us has to weave the web of his own experience. But 
though associative connections are always individually 
acquired, it is none the less true that parents and teachers 
can afford aid and guidance. Our aim here is to give 
the infant or the child, or the developing boy or girl, 
opportunities for the acquisition of healthy, wholesome 
experience. The acquisition itself is the private con- 
cern of this or that child; all that we can do is to secure, 
so far as is possible, satisfactory conditions for the es- 
tablishment of associations of the right sort. And this 
is a part of our ministration which requires tact and 
judgment. The world is full of objects which are in 
comparatively simple relationships with the child’s activ- 
ities. He soon finds out which of them, as unpleasant or 
hurtful, are to be avoided. We have little difficulty in 
furnishing the conditions for the gradual but sure ac- 
quisition of experience with regard to these objects. 
The only question is as to how far we should shield him 
from their unpleasant effects. We must not be too tender- 
hearted. The child who never has a chance of bruising 
his body or his sensitive nature against these objects will 
not be prepared to avoid contact with them when he is 
older. He will have to gain his experience of them some 
day; and not unfrequently it is for us to decide when 
that day shall come. Our task is more difficult when 
situations pleasant at the time beget habits which will
-P-A-G-E-81
MEMORY AND ASSOCIATION 67 
be harmful in the long-run; guidance here requires more 
tact; and it is all the more essential since it marks out 
the lines for future volitional control in the more highly 
evolved moral conduct. 
We shall have to return to association presently. We 
have regarded it as the linkage which is established within 
a disposition. Since the various items thus linked together 
lie side by side within the unity whole of a disposition, it 
is termed association by contiguity. This is probably the 
one and only type of association. The correlative of 
association is suggestion. ~All that has been associated 
within a coalescent disposition, or at any rate the net 
results which have value for experience, are called up or 
suggested by the initial phases, or some other part of a 
situation which is similar to that which called the dis- 
position into being. This is suggestion by similars. 
Memory by simple reinstatement need not involve any 
definite recognition with retrospective reference to the 
circumstances of the original development of what I have 
termed the mental disposition, though there may be what 
I spoke of as a fringe of pastness, a dim awareness of 
the former occurrence. This, however, is characteristic 
of much of that process to which most of us apply 
the term memory; indeed the term is restricted to this 
kind of remembering by some psychologists—by Professor 
Thorndike, for example. Walking down the street, I see 
a man, and have at first a feeling of indefinite recognition. 
I’ve met him before; but when and where escapes me. 
There is not much more than the dim awareness of some 
previous situation of my past experience in which he has 
somehow played a part. But it may become more. I 
look at him again more closely when we pass; and as 
I continue my walk keep the image of his face before 
me. Gradually, or perhaps suddenly, it becomes the 
 
-P-A-G-E-82
  
  68 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
nucleus of a memory picture. The man beneath it is 
clothed in a frock-coat; there is a clergyman standing 
near, robed; chancel steps, bride and bridegroom—of 
course, I have it. He was best-man at So-and-so’s wed- 
ding. Quite definitely I should now say that I remem- 
ber or recollect the fact; and recognise the man. This 
is a case of memory with retrospective reference. Sup- 
pose, however, that as I proceed farther down the, 
street I meet my old friend Brown. I don’t have to 
recollect that it is Brown. I recognise him at once, and 
greet him with the usual nod. The case is analogous to 
that of the child who knows a bird when he sees one. 
Is there retrospective reference here? Not to any par- 
ticular situation, as in the case of the wedding in which 
the best-man figured. Still it is there. If you asked me 
when and where I met that man, I should reply: What, 
Brown? Why, I see him every week, and have done so for 
years! We cycle out to the golf-links together; play bridge 
at each other’s house,—we are sometimes spoken of as the 
inseparables. The retrospective reference is indefinite 
just because there is so much of it. The fringe of past- 
ness is a fringe of perfect familiarity. The difficult thing 
to remember or recollect is when we first met Brown. 
But we do remember the occasion when a few kindly 
words made us realise what a good fellow he was—one 
worth knowing better. 
Now without going so far as to assert that memory with 
definite retrospective reference is confined to ideational 
process, we may at least say that it is only when one’s 
past experience has taken systematic form as an orderly 
sequence of events—a bit of our own history—that one 
can clearly and decisively place an event or the recognition 
of a person. But there is another way of placing—in a 
‘system of knowledge, independent of time and space.
-P-A-G-E-83
MEMORY AND ASSOCIATION 69 
Suppose a boy is reading over a geometry paper. This 
question has a mere indefinite fringe of pastness. The 
boy feels that he has come across this during the term— 
that is all. But his neighbour, after a little thought, may 
be able to place it accurately in a geometrical scheme. 
He met it in Euclid’s First Book, Prop. 15 (or some 
other system of geometry), and both greet with perfect 
familiarity such terms as “angle,” “base,” “ parallel” 
when they meet the eye. They are old friends (or 
enemies!). The boys may not pause to define them. But 
they feel (let us hope) that they could define them if they 
were required to do so. 
We thus see that memory with retrospective reference 
passes from an initial indefinite stage—have met the thing 
in past experience goodness knows when or where— 
through a definite stage of explicit placing (and it is here 
that the words “remember” and “recollect” find their 
common use), to a final stage of indefiniteness from sheer 
familiarity. We are sufficiently well acquainted with the 
first in our pupils (it is probably not unknown in ourselves); 
our aim should be to lead up through the second to the 
third. 
Just as attention may be either spontaneous or 
volitional, so too in the case of memory. The appropriate 
relational setting of any event or fact may either come to 
mind or it may be brought to mind with some effort. It 
is convenient to employ the term remembrance for the 
natural and spontaneous coming to mind in their appro- 
priate setting of images or ideas; and the term recollection 
for the process of, so to speak, hunting up the appropriate 
setting through the application of volitional activity. In 
this terminology we should speak of “ trying to recollect,” 
but not of “trying to remember,’ since remembrance 
comes of itself without effort of will. But the distinction, 
though convenient, is not preserved in popular speech.
-P-A-G-E-84
70 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
There is much discussion of the question how far the 
memory is susceptible of improvement. It is probable, 
but not certain, that retentiveness, upon which both 
remembering and recollecting ultimately depend, is a 
physiological datum, something given in the quality of 
the brain-substance, something which we can no more 
alter than we can change the size of our skulls, or, to 
take what is perhaps a closer analogy, the size of our 
muscles. By careful use and training we may develop 
our muscles within the limits assigned by nature. So too, 
by careful exercise we may perhaps develop retentiveness 
in ourselves and our pupils within the limits assigned to 
it by nature. But the limits are probably narrow—nar- 
rower than in the case of muscular development. Be 
this as it may, there is no question that the art of rec- 
ollection can be cultivated, and is susceptible of much 
improvement. If what is sometimes called the casual 
memory is a natural gift,—the systematic application of 
memory is an acquired art, and an art that is eminently 
serviceable in daily life and in framing a system of 
knowledge. A tenacious memory (say for dates) may be 
and sometimes is a snare—if it be allowed to take the 
place of, instead of contributing to, a systematic bringing 
of events into relationship and a rational comprehension 
of their significance. For example, I ask a boy who can 
readily learn a lot of dates, when Jonson’s Lvery Man in 
his Humour was published. He answers glibly, “1596.” 
I say: “Was Shakespeare still living?” He looks con- 
fused. And I continue: “Was Cromwell dead?” to his 
still greater confusion. And yet he can give me pat, if 
directly asked, the dates of Shakespeare’s death and of 
Cromwell’s Protectorate. He does not think, but trusts 
to parrot-like association. He has materials for historical 
time reference; but he cannot utilise them rationally and
-P-A-G-E-85
  MEMORY AND ASSOCIATION 71 
systematically. Another boy, of whom the same question 
concerning Jonson’s comedy is asked, may reply: “I do 
not remember the exact date, though I have seen it stated. 
But it was after the publication of the Faerie Queen and 
before Bacon’s Essays appeared. I happen to remember 
these dates; so Every Man in his Humour must have been 
produced between 1590 and 1597.” His answer is less ex- 
act; but it is more rational, and from the point of view 
of systematic knowledge of greater value. 
This is the kind of memory we can do much to improve 
by sound educational methods. It is of value in daily life, 
and its skilful employment marks the educated man, and 
it is essential to systematic progress in all fields of intellec- 
tual thought. Let me exemplify. A few days ago I 
chanced to come across an old faded photograph of a 
canoe. Instantly there flashed across my mind a vivid 
memory picture. There was absolutely no effort. It was 
a case of remembrance. The body of a dead man floated 
in the Thames. I saw, and see again now, the bow of my 
canoe in the immediate foreground, the dark-brown hair 
stirred by the water’s flow, the dimmer outline of the 
body, feet down-stream, the reeds near the bank to my 
left, a boat with two watermen rowing towards the corpse 
from the right, and many other details which I need not 
set down. And though I do not, of course, picture myself, 
I distinctly feel myself there in view of all this, and feel 
myself as a young man. The whole is so vivid that it 
might be actually before me, were it not for the fact that 
as I recall it there are the presentative elements of my 
present situation. I am not in a canoe, but in my chair at 
my study-table, my manuscript before me, a lamp to my 
left, and so forth; and I feel myself also as I am now, no 
longer a youth. Although these presentative impressions 
are in the field of consciousness, they are not (or were not)
-P-A-G-E-86
  72 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
in the field of attention till I began to set them down in 
writing. It is in large degree this discrepancy between 
the presentative now-situation and the re-presentative 
then-situation, both of which are in the field of conscious- 
ness, linked in the field of attention by my now writing 
concerning what has then-reference, that differentiates the 
remembered scene, and marks the memory process. Should 
I dream the scene to-night, the presentative background 
being lacking, it would seem to be actually here and now 
—or more strictly, time-reference would lapse. 
But clearly as I remember the scene on the river, I 
have to recollect when it occurred. As a matter of fact 
a quarter of an hour before I wrote this paragraph I 
could not have said exactly when the occurrence was. I 
had to hunt up other memories to give the requisite clues. 
How do I proceed? In the first place I can recollect 
when I bought and when I sold the canoe. That limits 
the range of time reference to a span of about four years. 
In the second place I remember that it was a great relief 
to see those watermen row up, for I was going to Switzer- 
land in a few days with my brother, and if no one else 
had seen the body, it would have been my duty to lodge 
information of the matter, and this might have delayed 
our start. But I went to Switzerland four years in suc- 
cession at that period of my life, only two of which, how- 
ever, overlapped with my possession of the canoe. This 
further limits the time-span within which the incident 
may have occurred, to two years. On searching for a fur- 
ther clue I recollect reading on the same afternoon, 
while I lunched, a note-book on mineralogy in view of my 
Swiss tour. That finally fixes the time as the summer of 
1873; for in the other possible year, 1872, glacial action 
occupied my chief attention. 
I have dealt with this incident at some length because 
 
-P-A-G-E-87
MEMORY AND ASSOCIATION 73 
it exemplifies the method of systematic recollection. I 
have from time to time taken some pains to learn how to 
run such events down, and get at their place in the scheme 
of my past experience. I am of opinion that it is of educa- 
tional and social value to teach such methods—I do not 
mean in set classroom work but incidentally. Boys and 
girls find it quite as interesting as much of their set work, 
and it may be of real value. For any one of us at any time 
may be summoned as a witness; and to be a good witness 
may be of great social importance. 
As in the establishment of skill, there is subconscious in- 
hibition of over-produced extraneous motor activities, hav- 
ing only the essential co-ordination necessary for the nicely 
adapted behaviour. So, too, in purposeful recollection 
there is a conscious and volitional repression of extraneous 
suggestion, unnecessary for the end in view, and diverting 
the attention. How difficult it is to keep uneducated per- 
sons to the point. You visit a country village, and, seeing 
a mural tablet in the church in memory of the Rev. Henry 
Williams, wish to know whether he was the author of that 
interesting little book on the customs of the Maoris in 
your father’s library. You seek for information from the 
old sexton. “ Why, you do mean old Parson Williams who 
was here when I was a lad. I was working then for the 
squire; a good master to me he was” (here follow sundry 
personal reminiscences). You recall his attention to the 
parson, “Oh yes! I remember him. He came and sat 
with me when I broke my leg” (the nature of the accident 
fully described). “ He was kind, sure enough. Not kinder 
than the doctor, though. Why, the doctor he comes in 
and he says, cheery-like” (here follows much concerning 
the good doctor). Again you bring him back to the Rev. 
Henry Williams. “Remember him; why, of course I do. 
He was a preacher ; but always from the book. Very differ-
-P-A-G-E-88
74 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
ent, sir, from the present vicar. He thumps the cushion 
and says it all out of his head” (here follows much about 
the present vicar). You lead him back into the track. 
“Had Mr. Williams been in foreign parts? Maybe he had. 
The old squire, now, he’d been all over the world. And 
the stories he could tell. When I lay abed after that 
accident he come in one day and he says to me, says he” 
(here follow some of the squire’s traveller’s tales). “ What 
did Parson Williams talk about. when he come in? Oh, I 
can’t rightly say. Bible stuff, mostly, and kindly meant. 
But I do mind he told me one day how the black fellows 
in New Zealand”— At last you have the clue you sought. 
But only after following the old sexton along many and 
devious paths of personal reminiscence, of which the above 
is only a condensed epitome. I have here introduced an 
example of what is sufficiently familiar, because it serves 
to illustrate the normal course of the flow of remembrance 
when it is not under the control of a definite volitional 
purpose; and because it serves to re-introduce the subject 
of suggestion as dependent on performed association. 
First, a few words by way of reminder. Near the outset 
of the first chapter attention was drawn to the fact that 
as we look around us in the course of daily experience 
we have at any moment a field of vision grouped around 
a central point or focus, and that in succeeding moments 
there is a successive regrouping around new visual centres. 
Extending the analogy we spoke of the field of conscious- 
ness grouped around the centre of attention. This field of 
consciousness comprises both presentative and re-present- 
ative factors, and owing to previous experience any given 
object of cognition may have meaning or significance 
attaching to it. In the succeeding chapter we learnt that 
there is around and closely connected with that which 
is in the focus of consciousness, a field of attention set
-P-A-G-E-89

in a surrounding field of non-attention. In this chapter 
we have seen how through primary retention an isolated 
disposition may be formed; and I drew attention to the 
fact that the complexity of the mental life is largely due 
to the overlap and interaction of many dispositions. We 
have now to try to bring these several points of view into 
relation, so as to interpret the flow of consciousness in 
remembrance and in recollection. 
If after calling upon a friend for an hour’s chat you 
take the trouble to note down the course of your con- 
versation, you will probably find that it has ranged over 
many topics. You begin by discussing some recent speech 
dealing forcibly with questions of fiscal policy, you end 
with old silver spoons. How did you get from one to 
the other? It will be convenient to adopt the logical 
phrase “ universe of discourse ” for each successive field of 
attention as the conversation proceeds. And it will be 
unnecessary to give more than a few salient steps in the 
regrouping around new centres of attention. To start 
with, fiscal problems are the focus of a political universe 
of discourse. But home-rule lurks in the margin. Soon 
this becomes the centre of a rearrangement, and Gladstone 
comes to the edge of the field and soon becomes the focus. 
The universe is changing. Morley’s “ Life ” hovers around. 
I happen to have been in South Africa when a certain 
action of Gladstone’s, in my opinion, sowed the seed from 
which the Boer War grew. This tingles in the margin, and 
soon leaps to the focus. After a wholesome disagreement 
as to Gladstone’s share in the matter, the war itself 
becomes the universe of discourse. This leads me to 
describe a monster “side show” on the war at the St. 
Louis Exposition. America becomes the universe of dis- 
course, with the Boer War still hovering around. Further 
details are needless. American sympathy with Japan in
-P-A-G-E-90

its late war, leads to a Japanese universe, this to that of 
their ceramic products, this in turn to Dresden china, this 
to a mutual friend’s fine collection, and this at last to his 
other hobby, old silver, and especially spoons! In every 
case the new centre is first introduced as a marginal ele- 
ment in the preceding universe, but becomes a new centre 
of rearrangement. Each step depends on a previous pre- 
paration, and the association of factors in a mental disposi- 
tion. Interest rules throughout as the affective tone 
attaching to the relationships in our thought. Every 
stage of suggestion depends upon some previous associa- 
tion by contiguity, though it may have other and perhaps 
more important implications. And it is always suggestion 
within the given universe. It is what it is under the con- 
ditioning relationships of the field of attention and of 
non-attention. 
We can perhaps conceive a very simple type of primi- 
tive experience, in which each several impression has been 
associated with others within a single disposition, and one 
only. That is not our adult experience, nor even that of 
a young child. It is inevitable that as soon as the life- 
relations become at all complex, as they must do, seeing 
that we have to deal with a number of situations, and 
possess only one set of sense organs and one brain where- 
with to tackle them, what we call the same impression 
must occur again and again in various settings, must 
play its part in many dispositions, and must have 
different associates in any one of them from what it has 
in the others. I have incidentally illustrated this (p. 25) 
in a slightly different connection, with regard. to water, 
the sight of which under one set of conditions suggests one 
disposition (say to drink it), and under another set of 
conditions a different use (say to wash in it). So, too, 
with our words. The sound of the word “cat” has been 
 
-P-A-G-E-91
MEMORY AND ASSOCIATION 77 
associated with the sight of the animal, with the sight of 
the word, as printed, with the pronunciation of the word, 
with the drawing of the animal, with the writing of the 
word. The mental disposition of the moment, the setting 
of the sound impression, will determine which group of 
associates shall be called up at the suggestion of the 
word. Under the conditions of repeating what the teacher 
reads, the pronunciation of the word is suggested; under 
the conditions of dictation, the writing of the word; under 
the conditions of a walk in the garden there will be an 
expectation of seeing a cat; and so forth. 
It should be noted that each of these several disposi- 
tions, in connection with which the sound of the word has 
a different meaning for behaviour, is a further illustration 
of that preparation we considered in the last chapter. Sup- 
pose someone asks you what you understand by the word 
“ox.” Fired point blank at you the word may be mean- 
ingless, just because it has so many meanings—a paint- 
box, a hat-box, a box at the opera, the coachman’s box, a 
box on the ear, a Christmas box, and so forth. The ques- 
tion is a ridiculous one; and no question should be put a 
child in such a blank and empty form. But suppose some- 
one says: Sauntering along the well-kept gravel walk, I 
admired the low, neatly-trimmed edging of box: what do 
you understand by the word “box”? Here the word is 
given in a definite setting, and the preparation of the 
previous part of the sentence in which it occurs should 
enable it to suggest an appropriate meaning. And there 
is an inhibition of other extraneous meanings—extraneous 
under the conditions of the sentence. 
Now in any free and untrammeled conversation, and in 
any reverie there are great numbers of extraneous sugges- 
tions. But unless one is to be a hopeless bore, most of 
them are inhibited, and what is specially inhibited will  
-P-A-G-E-92
78 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
partly depend on one’s company, partly on the relation of 
one’s own knowledge to that of one’s companion, partly on 
one’s total disposition. Perchance I know a little of geol- 
ogy ; if so, I may either repress a disposition to touch upon 
the subject in talking to Smith, who knows less than I do, 
for fear of wearying him; or I may give rein to my dispo- 
sition so as to make a parade of what little I know. On 
the other hand, while with Robinson, who is on the Geo- 
logical Survey, I may avoid the subject lest I betray the 
scantiness of my knowledge; or I may court it so that I 
may learn more. The conditions under which one’s talk, 
as an index of one’s thought, is either allowed to flow 
freely along the channels opened up by suggestion or is 
inhibited, are many and varied. But in the last resort 
they are an expression of one’s personality, one’s character, 
the net result of thousands of preformed dispositions. 
Now systematic recollection as a means to intellectual 
progress involves much volitional inhibition—much re- 
pression of extraneous suggestion. It involves the restric- 
tion of the memory process to a single definite universe 
of discourse undergoing purposeful development to a 
definite end. This is just what is so hard for boys and 
girls. It can only be attained by a gradual process of 
facilitation as the outcome of steady application and the 
formation of intellectual and rational dispositions. In 
daily life and in the pages of fiction (for example in Jane 
Austin’s inimitable Miss Bates) we meet with examples of 
the antithesis of this purposeful restriction of thought 
within a given universe. There is a gay and irresponsible 
skipping from universe to universe, half a dozen being 
danced through in a breath. Take for illustration the fol- 
lowing quite apocryphal extract from a schoolgirl’s letter: 
“Yesterday I walked by the pond, and found it, oh, 
so hot even for July. We skated there together last year.
-P-A-G-E-93
MEMORY AND ASSOCIATION 79 
It was just like flying through the air. I can conceive 
nothing more joyous than a bird’s life. Is it not sad that 
the poor soft things should be plucked to stuff a feather- 
bed. But for myself I prefer a mattress. I sleep better, 
and there is nothing more invigorating than sound sleep. 
It gives an edge to one’s appetite for breakfast. We always 
have porridge here, which reminds me of our delightful 
holiday in Scotland—the land of Burns and Walter Scott. 
I think the mountains far grander than those of Cumber- 
land, which were the inspiration of Wordsworth. I have 
been reading some of his poetry, but much prefer Tenny- 
son. Arthur is so delightfully mythical. I can’t under- 
stand anyone preferring Browning; and as to George Mer- 
edith’s poetry, well, my dear, it’s quite beyond me; though 
there are chapters in Hvan Harrington and The Egoist 
which are most racy,” and so on. 
I give this as an example of the irresponsible play of 
remembrance along lines of suggestion which arise spon- 
taneously. There is little attempt at inhibition. For the 
purpose in hand, that of chatting on paper to her school 
friend, there is no call for inhibition. But it is not 
impossible that the same girl, sitting before an examina- 
tion paper, might, by strenuous effort or will, recollect a 
long and difficult argument. If so, all these rapid transi- 
tions from universe to universe must be checked. Every 
suggestion which does not tend to the development of the 
answer and the recall of the stages of proof must be sup- 
pressed. Clearer now, perhaps, will be the significance of 
what I said above. Just as skilled acts are reached by 
the inhibition of all extraneous bodily movements, so are 
the higher forms of mental application reached by the 
inhibition of all that is extraneous in the movement -of 
thought along the lines opened out by suggestion. Both 
are selective, skill as such by a subconscious process mainly
-P-A-G-E-94
80 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
perceptual; thought as such by a more deliberately con- 
scious process, wholly ideational. For both it is essential 
that there should be material from which to select; in 
skill, an over-production of movements of the bodily 
organs; in thought, a rich and varied suggestiveness. And 
both are ultimately dependent on the establishment of 
associations within a growing disposition; in skill, the 
association between a presentation and the requisite re- 
sponse in action selected on the grounds of its success; 
in thought—well, let us consider the part played by 
association in ideational process. 
I described association as the establishment of connec- 
tions between the constituent factors of a single disposi- 
tion. Since, in a sense, they lie side by side within the 
field of primary retention, they are associations by con- 
tiguity. Take once more the simple case of an acquired 
disposition to take and eat chocolate. Several factors 
have been connected, and owing to their associative con- 
nection, the sight of a chocolate-drop suggests the dis- 
position as a whole, revives the previous situation. Since 
the chocolate-drop is not the same brown object which 
the child ate yesterday, but a similar one, this may be 
called suggestion by similars. I think it may be said that 
all association is by contiguity, and that all suggestion 
is by similars, for we never have the same presentation 
twice, though it may on the second occasion be another 
presentation from what we call the same source. We 
must remember that what is presented to consciousness 
is a situation as a whole, and this is seldom quite the same 
on two occasions; for practical behaviour, however, it must 
be sufficiently similar on subsequent occasions to reinstate 
a like disposition with its attendant response to the 
situation. 
But as experience develops and becomes more complex
-P-A-G-E-95
  
MEMORY AND ASSOCIATION 81 
the same factor (we may call it the same for practical 
purposes) occurs in different situations. When a factor 
is thus common to two diverse situations, its recurrence 
in one may reinstate the other. /When I see in the street 
the man who was prominent in ‘his frock-coat at So-and- 
so’s wedding, he is a common factor in this street-situation 
and in that church-situation. \He was associated by con- 
tiguity in that; he is associated by contiguity in this. 
The revival of the past scene is again a suggestion by 
similars. The man’s face in different settings is the com- 
mon factor. If the teacher will pause to consider, he will 
readily realise how much of his work involves this kind 
of suggestion. 
Now the process of comparison which lies at the very 
foundations of the ideational life is primarily an emphasis 
on some factor common to many situations. Part, and for 
our social life an essential part, of the resultant disposition 
is to name it. The process is repeated again and again 
under varying circumstances, until this common factor (let 
us say weight or hardness) grows familiar, like the appear- 
ance of our old friend Brown. It has been a factor in 
so many situations, that it no longer tends to revive any 
one in particular. But it is the result of comparison. 
And another part, and again an essential part for further 
ideational progress, of the resultant disposition, is a dis- 
position to compare. This involves a concentration of 
attention on the factors that do matter for the purpose 
in hand, and a relative disregard of the factors that do not 
matter. And new kinds of association are formed. When 
the child is comparing colours, not only those which re- 
semble each other but those which differ from one another, 
coalesce in one cumulative disposition to recognise simi- 
larity and difference. Both are present to consciousness 
in the moment of primary retention; they lie side by side
-P-A-G-E-96
  82 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
in one field of now-experience; they are associated by 
contiguity. Ideas of similarity and dissimilarity are 
distinguished and named. When once a disposition to 
compare is formed, each several factor tends to suggest 
its likes against a background of unlikes, its unlikes 
against a background of likes. It is a common factor 
—a “similar” of suggestive value. 
As the mental life grows richer and more complex, more 
subtle relationships are disclosed in a more decisively intel- 
lectual comparison. In the early stages of experience, 
suggestion by similars is dependent upon mere superficial 
resemblance. In later stages there is a suggestion by 
similarity in more deep-seated characters. It is probably 
impossible to draw any hard-and-fast distinction. But 
we may perhaps say that suggestion by resemblance need 
not involve any recognition of the similarity. In memory, 
by simple reinstatement such recognition of similarity is 
probably absent. We have in such cases suggestion by 
similars, but not necessarily the recognition of similars. 
In teaching a child, we are constantly indicating differ- 
ences and distinctions, as well as similarities and resem- 
blances. We teach him to group things together in virtue 
of their general resemblances, and to distinguish within 
the group in virtue of particular differences. This butter- 
cup is different from that daisy, but both are flowers; this 
dog is different from that cat, but both are animals; Mabel 
is different from Lucy, but both are girls; and so on in a 
great number of cases. This constant habit of comparing 
things begets a tendency in a quick-witted child to be on 
the look-out not only for resemblance, but also for contrast. 
And as this habit becomes more and more established with 
passing years and growing experience, there is an increas- 
ing tendency for things to suggest not only their likes but 
their opposites. To suggestion by resemblance is added
-P-A-G-E-97
  MEMORY AND ASSOCIATION 83 
suggestion by contrast. And when such contrasts have 
been suggested, they become associated by contiguity, and 
the subsequent suggestion is thus reinforced. The lan- 
guage of description constantly uses resemblance and con- 
trast side by side, the one to enforce the other. The wing 
of the penguin, we say, is like the flipper of the seal, and 
very different from the wing of a swift or a seagull. The 
sea looked dull and gloomy, there was no life or brightness 
in the scene. A. is slow, sure, and industrious, and quite 
unlike the brilliant but terribly idle Z. And so in a 
number of other similar cases, which will readily suggest 
themselves. 
The language of the poet is full of suggestions by resem- 
blance, similarity, and contrast. I will illustrate this by 
a few examples from Tennyson. Resemblance prompts 
such lines as 
“A brow 
May-blossom, and a cheek of apple-blossom.” 
“And her hair 
In gloss and hue the chestnut, when the shell 
Divides threefold to show the fruit within.” 
But it is similarity of relations which is suggestive in 
“A rosebud set with little wilful thorns, 
And sweet as English air could make her.” 
There is more of similarity than resemblance in 
“A laugh, 
Ringing like proven golden coinage true.” 
So, too, in the question : 
“Was he not 
A full-cell’d honeycomb of eloquence, 
Stored from all flowers?” 
 
-P-A-G-E-98
84 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
The alternating cloud and sunshine of April suggest 
the comparison of the lines: 
“And hopes and light regrets that come, 
Make April of her tender eyes.” 
  A somewhat similar thought occurs again in 
“So sweetly gleam’d her eyes behind her tears, 
Like sunlight on the plain behind a shower.” 
One or two more examples of analogies drawn from 
Nature must suffice. 
“A doubtful throne is ice in summer seas.” 
This simile was no doubt suggested by the instability of 
the equilibrium of an iceberg melting in a warm current. 
The suggestiveness of flowers was always great and varied 
for Tennyson. 
“Wearing the white flower of a blameless life.” 
“Wait, and Love himself will bring 
The drooping flower of knowledge changed to fruit 
Of wisdom.” 
My last example of such suggestions by similarity is 
a rather more complex one, in which an analogy is drawn 
between the forging of metal and the forging of character. 
It occurs in In Memoriam— 
“Life is not as idle ore, 
But iron dug from central gloom, 
And heated hot with burning fears, 
And dipt in baths of hissing tears, 
And batter’d with the shocks of doom 
To shape and use.” 
By the man of science, as by the poet, suggestion by 
similarity, with occasional illustrative contrast,is constantly 
used in description and in explanation. The moon, we
-P-A-G-E-99
  MEMORY AND ASSOCIATION 85 
say, is continually falling towards the earth, as a stone 
falls towards the ground; or, the moon swings round the 
earth as a ball at the end of a string swings round your 
hand. Just as the straight-falling raindrops seem to be 
slanting to a man who is driving rapidly in a dogcart, so 
do the rays of light from distant stars seem to change 
their direction as the earth whirls round in her orbital 
course. Just as the artificial selection of the gardener 
tends to the preservation of the strongest and most beau- 
tiful plants, so does the destruction of the weakly and 
imperfect, in the natural struggle for existence among 
organisms, tend to the survival of the strongest and 
healthiest. Just as, to give one more example, pressure 
will squeeze ice into the condition of water, because 
water expands on freezing, so will pressure squeeze molten 
rock into the solid condition, because molten rock con- 
tracts on solidifying. This last example shows how a 
fairly simple process of reasoning is based on an insight 
into inverse similarity of relations. 
We seem to have travelled a long distance from our 
foundations in association by contiguity, and the simpler 
forms of suggestion by similars. And yet there is prob- 
ably not an original thought which is not proximately or 
ultimately dependent on such association and such sug- 
gestion. Let us consider a particular case, for example 
Tennyson’s line: 
“A doubtful throne is ice in summer seas.” 
There is nothing in a doubtful throne to lead directly to 
the suggestion of an iceberg. The two had perhaps never 
before been associated within one thought-disposition. 
The connections are indirect. There must be some 
mediating factor. The doubtful throne is unstable. 
Instability becomes the centre of thought. But there are
-P-A-G-E-100
86 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
many examples of instability, such as inverted pyramids, 
unskilled skaters, and among others, icebergs which 
occasionally “turn turtle.’ Instability thus is a mediat- 
ing factor between doubtful throne and other things, in- 
cluding icebergs. But why is the iceberg selected from 
among other examples? Because the instability of the 
iceberg is due to the undermining of warm water, and 
the instability of the throne is likewise due to undermin- 
ing by the waters of disaffection. We have a second 
mediating factor in the sapping of foundations. That 
secures the selection of iceberg from other examples. In 
the diagram below, A is the doubtful throne implying, 
as doubtful, B, instability. A and B have already been 
associated in thought. But B has also been associated 
with C, the doubtful iceberg. A and C are now factors 
within one disposition, and are thus for the first time 
associated. Furthermore, the instability, B, which is 
  common to both A and C, is associated with undermin- 
ing, D. This clinches the connection between A and C. 
It only remains for the poet as artist to express 
his thought with delicate suggestiveness. There is no 
elaborate unfolding of the thought. It suffices to say 
that “A doubtful throne is ice in summer seas.” We are 
left to perceive the congruity between the universe of 
doubtful throne and that of ice in summer seas. A good 
pun suddenly shunts our thought into a new universe; 
but to be a really good one there must be a congruous 
incongruity in the relation of the two universes. We
-P-A-G-E-101
MEMORY AND ASSOCIATION 87 
come back to the old thought with a smile or a laugh. 
At the close of one of Huxley’s lectures a group of 
students were discussing difficulties. “I cannot under- 
stand it,” exclaimed an able Frenchman. “ Never mind, 
old fellow,” said a feather-head, “ we’re all rowing in the 
same boat.” “But, thank the Lord,” was the prompt 
reply, “not with the same sculls.” Note here the subtle 
interaction between the two universes. 
Not only may a fresh simile or metaphor or a, brilliant 
pun arise out of the bringing into relation of diverse but 
in some way congruous universes of discourse, a new 
hypothesis may thus be suggested. Charles Darwin and 
Dr. Alfred Russell Wallace both reached the conception 
of Natural Selection on reading Malthus’s work on 
Population. Both had acquired a system of knowledge 
concerning the relationships of animals and plants. In 
both the net results were constantly in mind. As they 
ranged in thought over the system, now one and now 
another factor was in the focus of attention, with a re- 
arrangement of the other factors around it. They read 
Malthus. Unless some factor in the Malthusian universe 
of discourse coincided or was congruous with some factor 
in the universe of biological thought, the two could not 
come into fruitful relation. But there was a mediating 
factor common to both—over-production of offspring. 
There were other features sufficiently congruent to enable 
the Malthusian discussion to throw light on the problems 
of biology. Hence arose the suggestion, through the 
mediation of previous associations, of Natural Selection 
through the elimination of the unfit. New suggestions 
always arise within the area of intersection of different 
but allied universes, containing a factor or factors common 
to both. 
Much confusion has unfortunately arisen from the
-P-A-G-E-102
88 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
employment of the word “association,” both for the 
establishment of connections and for the suggestion which 
results. Assuming that the simile in Shelley’s lines— 
“Drive my dead thoughts over the universe 
Like withered leaves to quicken a new birth,” 
was for him an original thought, then it may well be 
asked: How can this be a case of association, since the two 
constituent factors of the simile never occurred together 
before? These constituent factors are “dead thoughts” 
and “withered leaves.” The bringing of them into 
relationship is wholly new. But the universe of “dead 
thoughts” and the universe of “withered leaves” have a 
common factor—they form a fertile soil on the one hand 
for new thoughts, and on the other hand for fresh vegeta- 
tion. This is the point of contact necessary for any 
suggestion by similars. The facts, then, are these. A 
quickening fertility has been associated with last year’s 
thoughts and last year’s leaves. It is the “similar” 
through the intervention of which the one suggests the 
other. Only after suggestion can we say that the two— 
dead thoughts and withered leaves—have been associated. 
And how associated? By contiguity. By their joint 
occupancy of the same intellectual outlook in a moment 
of primary retention. 
The gist of the whole matter is this. Memory works 
through suggestion; the one principle of suggestion is 
that which has been termed suggestion by similars. This 
suggestion is always directly or indirectly, immediately 
or mediately, dependent on previous association. The one 
principle of association is that by contiguity—the co- 
existence of diverse factors in one disposition, one 
situation, one system of thought, one outlook at the 
moment of primary retention. Every new and original
-P-A-G-E-103
MEMORY AND ASSOCIATION 89 
thought, and all mental initiative, are dependent on 
memory. But only when memory becomes the handmaid 
of the higher mental processes concerned in synthesis 
and construction, do we find the illuminating suggestions 
of the artist, the poet, or the man of science. 
A distinction was drawn a few pages back between 
suggestion by similars and recognition of similars. The 
former has primarily a prospective reference; the latter 
has often a retrospective reference, and always involves 
some element of deliberate comparison. On opening my 
front door as I leave the house I notice the lowering 
state of the sky, and take my umbrella from the stand. 
This behaviour is the outcome of suggestion by similars. 
Such action has been frequently associated with such 
an appearance of the sky. I think no more about the 
matter. But suppose I pause and say to my wife, “ Does 
not this threatening sky to-day remind you of the cloud 
effect we noticed last Sunday?” Then there is recognition 
of similars. This sky-scape is compared with a previous 
experience, and pronounced to be similar. There is retro- 
spective reference. There is not merely a suggestion of 
appropriate behaviour; there is a deliberate judgment 
concerning the similarity, and a recall of that cloud- 
effect, which is compared with this, and said to be of 
like nature.
-P-A-G-E-104
CHAPTER IV 
PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE 
A DISTINCTION between naive, practical experience and a 
system of knowledge has already been very briefly 
indicated. The teacher in the course of his work is 
ministering to the development of both, and of each in 
close touch with the other. But though, in beings who 
are both intelligent and rational, there is continual 
interaction between the one and the other, it is well to 
distinguish them, so as to understand the nature of the 
interaction. By practical experience we are to understand 
that which is immediately and directly of guiding value 
in a particular and concrete situation. Thus when a child 
sees a flower it means for his practical experience some- 
thing which he can pluck, smell, place in a vase, and so 
on. For such behaviour towards it he need not have any 
systematic knowledge. He just assimilates the visual 
impression to his previous experience of doing something 
with flowers, and acts accordingly. There need not be 
more than suggestion by similars. But when some day 
he is taught that the petal of a flower may be regarded 
as a modified leaf, he assimilates the idea in relation 
to a system of knowledge by which plant structures may 
be interpreted. Here there is not only suggestion by 
similars, but also recognition of similars. If, again, he 
be shown how this colourless liquid, when added to that 
90
-P-A-G-E-105
PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE 91 
pale yellow liquid, gives a brown cloud, he assimilates 
this to his previous practical experience in the chemical 
laboratory, where a number of curious experiments are 
shown; but when he is taught that if ammonium hydrate 
and ferric chloride are mixed there are formed ferric hy- 
drate and ammonium chloride, he may assimilate the inter- 
change in relation to his system of knowledge about 
chemical reactions. If he really grasps the significance 
of the experiment he realises that it is an example of 
what may be illustrated by other examples. He sees the 
particular case in the light of a definite rule which 
forms part of a scheme of chemical thought. 
It should be noticed that the mere addition of a new 
impression or a new idea is not necessarily assimilation. 
To be assimilated the new must be brought in line with 
and incorporated in that part of the practical experience 
or systematic knowledge with which it is congruent. The 
new must not, therefore, be wholly new. There must be 
some features which are sufficiently familiar to bring the 
partly new into line with previous experience or know- 
ledge, and thus to enable the outstanding differences to 
be incorporated so as to extend and enrich that experience 
and knowledge. 
I have spoken of meaning for the situations with which 
practical experience has to deal, in contradistinction to 
significance for the system. In the chemical laboratory 
a great deal of the experimental work of beginners has 
meaning long before it acquires its due significance. 
Adding this reagent to such and such a liquid means 
certain results—precipitation, solution, effervescence, or 
what not. We say that these results are obtained by 
mere rule of thumb; for rule of thumb is essentially the 
product of naive experience, which fixes its eye upon the 
practical outcome without troubling about the underlying
-P-A-G-E-106
92 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
causes or the significance for a scheme of thought. Now 
for a boy to go on for years in sole reliance on such rule- 
of-thumb manipulation—as used to be the case in the 
days which are sometimes spoken of as those of “mere 
test-tubing,” when a more or less mechanical process of 
qualitative analysis reigned supreme in the laboratory—is 
of little value as a training in scientific thought; but it 
may be a training, and a good one, in practical experience. 
Some such training is essential. For scientific thought, in 
such a subject, without facility in scientific work, without 
the ease which comes of familiarity with practical manipu- 
lation, may occasionally make successful examinees, in 
paper work, but will never make efficient chemists. 
The teaching of science in schools only rises to its full 
value when a body of practical experience, full of homely 
rule-of-thumb meaning from repeated manipulation, is 
allowed gradually to acquire significance for a growing 
system of theoretical knowledge in which the intellect 
moves freely and securely. And neither the practical 
experience so gained, nor the scheme of thought so 
developed, is of chief value in and for itself. The boy 
may never in his after-life have occasion to prosecute 
any further his scientific studies. Has the time devoted 
to them therefore been wasted? Not if his faculties 
have been thereby trained. Not if he have learnt from 
the special case the general lesson of the essential value 
of a sound basis in practical experience; of the methods 
by which a system of knowledge is founded on such a 
basis; of the paramount importance of keeping experience 
and knowledge in close and vital touch with each other. 
This he will find of lasting service to him, whatever may 
be his calling in after-life. 
We have now to consider how the child gains such 
experience as will enable him to deal practically and
-P-A-G-E-107
PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE 93 
effectually with the situations of his daily life. We shall 
have later on to consider how he learns to extract from 
such experience the ideas which he builds up into a 
system of knowledge. There must first be perception 
having reference to things and events which mean some- 
thing, before there can be conception of their significance 
for a scheme of thought. Both perception and conception 
are modes of cognition. 
When we say that the child perceives that things are 
near or far, heavy or light, on this side or that, hard or 
soft, what do we understand by such perception, and how 
is such perceptual experience gained? Think what answer 
you would give in view of your own experience; and 
think of it in terms of what I have spoken of as meaning. 
We say that the glass letter-weight on the table looks 
smooth and heavy and hard, and at a certain distance. 
That is to say, the visual impression is such as to suggest 
that the object will be smooth to the touch, heavy if we 
lift it, resistant to pressure; and that to put these sugges- 
tions to the test we must reach out our hand to it, and 
perhaps walk a few paces first. The meaning of a given 
visual impression is in terms of cross-reference to other 
possible impressions. If we hear a lark’s note above us 
during a Spring walk, we look up in the expectation of 
seeing it. Any presented experience has meaning in so 
far as it suggests other modes of experience. But how 
do we get these other modes of experience; how did we 
get them in the first instance when we were children? 
Always by behaving in some way at the bidding of a 
presentative impression; always by some sort of applica- 
tion of our every-day activities following on the sensory 
presentation. Now we have seen that our own behaviour 
and active movements afford a well-marked and readily 
distinguishable group of impressions—technically these
-P-A-G-E-108
94 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS ~- 
are termed kinesthetic impressions, with corresponding 
kinesthetic images. It is a noteworthy fact that any 
kinesthetic image, especially if it is at all vivid, has a 
strong tendency to generate a motor impulse which shall 
call into action the behaviour imaged. If we think about 
moving one of our fingers, and try and picture what it 
would feel like to do so, we may find that the muscles 
of that finger are beginning to twitch, and perhaps ere 
long we shall bend the finger. Often this takes place just 
after we have been thinking of it. We have been inhibiting 
the tendency to bend it, and when the inhibition ceases 
the movement occurs. 
The meaning, then, of any experience is in terms of 
other kinds of experience, and it is acquired through 
some form of behaviour, often some form of manipulation 
of that which is in this way becoming an object of 
experience. An impression which carries such meaning 
is raised to the level of a percept. Perception only 
occurs when such meaning is suggested. When we say 
that a child perceives that a brown object is a piece of 
chocolate, we imply that it has some meaning for the 
child as the result of previous experience. And since 
some form of behaviour is always implicated, it may be 
said that all perception involves kinesthetic factors. 
That is a technical way of saying that whenever we 
perceive a thing, there is suggested something that we 
may or can do to it, or some form of behaviour as the 
result of its presence. Of course we may not actually 
do anything; but that is because the suggested behaviour 
is inhibited. 
Although, however, we may quite clearly grasp the 
general truth of the fact that practical experience 
depends on meaning for the familiar activities of our 
daily life, it is not so easy to explain in detail the
-P-A-G-E-109
  PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE 95 
manner of its origin. Not only did our early experience 
take form at a time of childhood to which our memories 
do not reach back; not only is it difficult or impossible 
to interpret what is the nature of the infant’s experience; 
but, even in the case of the later development of the 
perceptual process, we are often at a loss to say just 
how it came about. For one characteristic of practical 
experience is that its possessor, unless he is accustomed to 
systematic introspection, finds it very hard to tell us how 
it was established. It has grown up so gradually; so 
much of it has been acquired subconsciously; it has 
passed to such an extent into settled habit; there has been 
so much of adding just a few successful touches here, 
and omitting what was redundant or led to failure there; 
it has, in a word, been developed so insensibly, that we 
feel disposed to say that the serviceable foundations of our 
daily behaviour have been established rather in us and 
for us by some kindly and beneficient psychological fairy, 
than by us through any exercise of our volitional powers. 
The fact is that much of our practical experience is 
organised in the region of non-attention; and yet more is, 
in adult life, transacted in that region, the field of 
attention being occupied with the end to be attained 
rather than with the practical means by which this attain- 
ment is reached. 
It is part of the business of the psychologist, however, 
to make what goes on in the region of non-attention 
a topic of inquiry. In such an inquiry certain technical 
terms are helpful. The growth of experience, whether in 
the field of attention or in the region of non-attention, 
depends upon the correlation of the data afforded by the 
senses—and not only of the traditional “ five senses,” but 
also those which contribute to our experience of tempera- 
ture, of changes in the direction of the movements of the
-P-A-G-E-110
  96 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
head or body as a whole, the organ for which is situated 
in the ear, and especially those kinesthetic impressions 
which arise from the movements of our limbs and eyes. 
The two most important groups of correlations are—(1) 
those between the data afforded by external objects among 
themselves, for example between the sight of an apple and 
its “feel,” weight, temperature, smell, and taste; and (2) 
between these data and the kinesthetic impressions 
derived from the behaviour, which, in the above case for 
instance, the apple calls forth. Although these latter 
impressions originate within the body, the nerve-currents 
which give rise to the concomitant cerebral processes are 
brought by afferent nerves from outside the brain. In 
this sense it may be said that correlation deals entirely 
with data brought into consciousness. When we are re- 
garding the matter, therefore, from the point of view of 
the acquisition and organising of experience, we speak of 
the correlation of the data afforded by the special senses 
among each other, and with those due to movements. But 
when we regard the matter from the point of view of the 
putting forth of the activities, we speak of the co-ordina- 
tion of these activities. All matters of skill in the use of 
our bodily organs involve this co-ordination. Many muscles 
are concerned in what we are wont to regard as compara- 
tively simple activities, such as walking or speaking. Al 
these muscles have to be called into play in due degree, 
and with nicely balanced activity. We are not, however, 
conscious of the details of this process, which is, in fact, 
a physiological one. What we are conscious of is the net 
result of the process. We are conscious, that is to say, of 
the activity as a whole, not of the individual play of all 
the muscles which bring about the activity. 
To do a thing, and to know how you do it, are two very 
different things. Ask a boy how he manages that clever 
 
-P-A-G-E-111
PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE 97 
back-stroke at lawn-tennis. He cannot tell you: he does 
not know. He has no idea how he learnt to do it. He 
supposes it is practice. But he will show you how he does 
it with much pride and pleasure. The feat of skill requires 
a wonderfully nice and accurate co-ordination of activities, 
involving I know not how many muscles in various parts 
of the body: the impressions which accompany this co- 
ordination are correlated, and afford the data requisite for 
the maintenance of control over the activities in question. 
But what the co-ordinations are, the boy does not know, 
and probably does not care. They have been established 
subconsciously and are utilised subconsciously; and know- 
ledge is a matter not of subconscious effects, but of that 
which is focal and definite to consciousness. It may per- 
haps be said that the correlations requisite for the per- 
formance of a feat of skill are not subconscious, but are 
unconscious; that the whole matter is one of mere bodily 
mechanism, and not psychological at all. Two replies 
may be given to such an assertion: a general reply and a 
special reply. The general reply is, that in so far as the 
skilled activity is a feat performed under guidance and 
control, the requisite data for such guidance must have 
been present to consciousness. It can hardly be main- 
tained that the boy who makes the clever back-hand 
stroke at lawn-tennis is a mere automaton; his feat is 
the result of experience gained by frequent practice; 
and unconscious experience is a contradiction in terms. 
The special reply is, that if you attend to the matter you 
will be able to a large extent to make the subconscious 
correlations focal to consciousness. Then you will be able 
not only to perform the feat of skill, but to know, and to 
some extent to describe, how you do it. 
Now there is a sense in which it may be said that the 
establishment of correlations is a matter of individual
-P-A-G-E-112
98 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
experience, and is dependent upon the formation of 
associations within a psychological disposition. For a 
psychological disposition as such is not inherited, but 
acquired. The relation of correlation and co-ordination 
is, however, a very close and intimate one. | This, at any- 
rate, is certain: that co-ordinations ofr activity may 
be and often are-inherited.” Indeed it may be said that the 
basal foundations of all co-ordination are hereditary. The 
mechanism for reflex acts, for those automatic responses 
which have not to be learnt, and for all instinctive pro- 
cedure—that carried out prior to individual experience— 
is part of our organic or biological heritage. But if the 
correlations of the data afforded to experience have to bé 
individually acquired, and association established anew in 
each child, how does the infant make a start in reducing 
the multitude of sensory data that rain in upon the dawn- 
ing consciousness to something approaching serviceable 
order? In the first place, the data belonging to the first 
of the two groups I spoke of—those which afford material 
for the impressions of external objects and events—are not 
indefinitely commingled pell-mell and anyhow; they are 
ordered and graded in accordance with the relations of the 
environment. Sights, sound, touches, and so forth, come 
to the child in groups; there is a presentation of a more 
or less orderly situation, not a mere jumble of individual 
and separate sensations. All that is required, therefore, 
is that the connections between already-grouped stimuli 
should be established in brain and consciousness. I spoke 
of this in the second chapter as part of the primordial 
tissue of experience. What is inherited is a brain so 
organised as not only to receive the grouped stimuli but 
at once to link them by associative connections. That 
is to say, the correlation itself is not inherited; but the 
physiological conditions within the central nervous system
-P-A-G-E-113
  PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE 99 
which shall form the organic concomitants of such cor- 
relation. This may seem a distinction without a difference. 
But it is in accordance with the view widely accepted, that 
experience as such is not transmitted through heredity. 
What is inherited is the brain which affords the physio- 
logical conditions for the genesis of experience. In the 
second place, the inherited co-ordinations of the motor 
activities, causing the muscles to contract and the joints 
to work in their already ordered fashion, secure that the 
data coming in from them too, shall be duly related in such 
a way that association can link them to their fellows within 
the co-ordinated group which is affording the material for 
correlation, And in the third place, the hereditary automa- 
tism of response, in reflex acts and instinctive procedure, 
further secures that the data afforded by surrounding ob- 
jects shall be linked through association with those afforded 
by appropriate behaviour. So that, taking these three to- 
gether, heredity, though it does not provide the correlation 
itself, does provide the organic conditions under which a 
corrélation, from the first more or less orderly, shall be 
established. The further work of correlation is to knit all 
these data into a more and more serviceable web, in accord- 
ance with the growing meaning of acquired experience. 
Let us now take one or two further examples of correla- 
tion. Suppose that we were blind and deaf; then, so far 
as our active life was concerned, we should be almost 
entirely limited to the correlation of the data afforded by 
touch and pressure among themselves, and with the data 
afforded to consciousness by the movements of our limbs. 
As we felt our way about the world, touches or pressures 
in various parts of our bodies would be associated with 
the hereditary or acquired movement of our limbs. The 
hands, and especially the finger-tips, are the central 
organs of touch—those which we bring to bear on an
-P-A-G-E-114
  100 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
object when we desire to make it focal to tactual con- 
sciousness. If, as we felt about the table, something came 
in contact with our wrist, we should at once move the 
hand and fingers so as to bring it to the focus of touch, 
that we might feel out what it was; as indeed we all do 
when we are groping for something in the dark. Thus we 
should organise what is called a field of touch, and, with 
increasing experience, this field would be better and better 
organised. Touches and pressures would mean more for us. 
Now, suppose that to the sense of touch we add that of 
sight. This enables us to feel about us, so to speak, in a 
wider field,—that of vision. New and more widely service- 
able correlations would be established. First of all those 
between retinal data and those afforded by the movements 
of the eyes. The field of vision becomes most delicately 
and accurately organised and interconnected, so that, if 
any object appears in the margin of that field, we at once 
move the eyes in such a way as to make it focal. And 
this involves not merely the co-ordinated movements of 
the two eyes in their sockets, but the changes of con- 
vergence and accommodation necessary for clear vision of 
things at different distances. The familiar experience of 
seeing an object at a certain distance is thus due to the 
correlation of retinal data with the kinesthetic impres- 
sions which accompany the co-ordination of eye move- 
ments and of the muscular processes by which the lens is 
accommodated for clear vision. But this, in the experience 
of daily life, takes place so completely in the region of 
non-attention that few of us realise that any kinesthetic 
factors are present. Only when we make such an ex- 
periment as holding a pencil-point at a distance of about 
ten inches from the eyes, and alternately fixing them on 
this point and on some distant point on the wall, and ask 
ourselves whether we can attend to the kinesthetic factors,
-P-A-G-E-115
PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE 101 
do we realise their presence. Under ordinary circumstances 
the feelings of eye-movements and accommodation, as 
such, are, so to speak, submerged, leaving only their 
practical meaning, namely, that the object of vision is 
situated out there, and at a certain distance from us. 
But what does this visual distance-meaning itself mean? 
For common experience it has a very practical meaning. 
The child who sees a sweet on the table before him, 
reaches out his hand to take it up. Visual distance for 
him means distance in the field of touch. And if the 
object is farther off, so that he has to go to it in order to 
reach it, visual distance is correlated with distance for 
locomotion. Thus the field of vision and the fields of 
touch and of free movement are correlated. Furthermore, 
as we stretch out our hand to seize an object within our 
reach, we see it cross the field of vision; and a correlation 
is established between the movements of our limbs, as 
seen, and the same movements as given in kinesthetic 
terms. Again, if we fix our eyes upon some object, and 
then move our hand in front of our face, still keeping 
the eyes fixed, we see the hand cross the field of vision 
from margin to margin; and if then, releasing our eyes 
from the object on which they have been fixed, we allow 
them to follow the hand, we experience a series of kin- 
esthetic impressions as the eyes turn in their sockets. In 
the one case the movement is a change of the position 
of an object in the field of vision; in the other case it 
is a change of position in the organs of vision. Or take 
another example. As I write, the rooks are returning 
to their nests and flying westwards past my window. I fix 
my eyes on the corner of the opposite house, and rook 
after rook enters and crosses the margin of my visual 
field. My eyes remain fixed all the time. But now I 
focus my vision upon a certain rook and follow him across
-P-A-G-E-116
102 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
the sky, keeping him steadily in full view. As I do so, 
the house and trees opposite and the clouds in the sky 
seem to drift across my visual field as my eyes move, 
following the bird’s flight. Thus when my eyes are fixed, 
there is a real movement of the external object, the rook, 
across the field of vision; and, when my eyes follow the 
rook, there is—(1) a real movement of the eyes, and (2) 
an apparent movement of the fixed objects round me, the 
house, trees, distant clouds. All these changes in the field 
of vision and movements of the eyes are gradually cor- 
related for the purpose of practical behaviour. And when 
our bodies are also in movement, when we are walking or 
cycling or driving, further correlations are involved. 
Besides those we have been briefly considering, there 
are also correlations of the data afforded by the sense of 
hearing, that of smell, our temperature senses, and those 
of direction, to which passing allusion has been made. 
But further examples of the process are unnecessary. It 
is sufficient to notice that all these correlations in the 
special fields of touch, sight, hearing, taste, smell, and so 
forth, together with those in the field of active movement 
aided by the sense of direction, gradually coalesce, and, 
becoming shot through and through with meaning, are 
organised into the wider and more comprehensive field, 
which we may term that of practical experience as a 
whole. Its development is a process of natural growth, 
like that of the plant which puts forth its shoots, leaves, 
and buds, and develops into a beautifully symmetrical 
tree, or like that of the child’s own body, in which the 
limbs and all the organs develop in due relation to each 
other. While, therefore, it is probably true that the cor- 
relations of sensory data are not inherited, but have to be 
individually acquired, it is none the less true that it is 
due to the inherent and inherited tendencies of our mental
-P-A-G-E-117
PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE 103 
nature that we form such correlations if the necessary 
data are duly supplied. There is no evidence that this, 
that, or the other correlation is inherited; but it is unques- 
tionably true that the capacity for correlation is an inalien- 
able mental possession. The sensory data of experience 
are the food of the mind; each individual has to find or 
to be supplied with his own food; but the power of deal- 
ing with the food, so as to build with it an organised 
and correlated body of experience—that is part of our 
hereditary dower. 
But though the development of the body of experience 
is, in large degree, a process of natural growth, taking 
place in us and for.us rather than by any definite exer- 
cise of our volitional activity, it must not be supposed 
that it is independent of, and out of touch with, either 
our voluntary behaviour in dealing with concrete situa- 
tions or the later purposes and motives of our rational 
and moral conduct. The point is rather that, so far as the 
application of our conscious activities is concerned, atten- 
tion is fixed chiefly on the completion of a concrete situa- 
tion than the details of the means by which the completion 
is reached. More adequate and complete correlation, 
more effective and accurate co-ordination, are incidental 
to the development of the situation on which the atten- 
tion is chiefly concentrated. In the training of hand and 
eye, the educational end of which is to establish a close, 
effective, and smoothly working correlation in the experi- 
ence gained in the fields of touch, sight, and manipulative 
behaviour, it is not to the correlation, as such, that the 
pupil’s attention is directed. It is directed to the accu- 
rate performance of a concrete task; it is directed to the 
doing of something well, rapidly, and effectually. At first 
it is done awkwardly, slowly, ineffectually. The requisite 
correlations and co-ordinations have not yet been knit
-P-A-G-E-118
104 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
together in a working and workable part of the body of 
experience. There are redundancies here, inaccuracies 
there, and a net result of comparative failure. It is the 
failure which appeals to consciousness with a feeling-tone 
of dissatisfaction. But gradually the redundancies are 
eliminated, the divergencies from accuracy drawn into 
right lines, and in place of failure there is comparative 
success, with a feeling-tone of satisfaction. Just how the 
awkward redundancies have dropped out, and the crooked 
paths straightened, neither pupil nor teacher could prob- 
ably tell. Practice has made perfect; but by what subtle 
details the relative perfection has been reached we find 
it difficult to say. It is part of the subconscious organ- 
isation of experience. 
Regarded from the point of view of co-ordination we 
speak of this subconscious organisation of experience as 
the attainment of skill. The nicety of control that may 
thus be reached is truly remarkable. I have elsewhere * 
taken the case of the marksman at the rifle-butts as an 
example. At a distance of 1000 yards a deviation of the 
muzzle of the rifle by less than 74, of an inch involves a 
deflection of the bullet, when it hits the target, of six 
inches from the centre of ‘the bull’s eye. The rifleman, 
we will suppose, is lying down, prone, supporting his elbow 
on the ground, and grasping his rifle, say, halfway between 
the fulcrum, where the stock is held to the shoulder, and 
the free muzzle of the piece. A deviation of the muzzle 
by zhz of an inch to right or left involves, therefore, a 
deviation of the hand by half this amount, or s4y of an 
inch. But the hand which moves, is carried at the end 
of a lever consisting of the fore-arm from elbow to wrist, 
and its movement is effected in the main by muscles in 
1 Introduction to Comparative Psychology, p. 164. Some further 
illustrations are also drawn from the same source.
-P-A-G-E-119
PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE 105 
the upper arm and around the shoulder. A relatively 
small movement of the point of free insertion of one of 
these muscles produces a relatively large movement of the 
hand and wrist. Hence it is certainly no exaggeration 
to say that the skilful marksman has his motor co- 
ordination under control to within the z5 part of an 
inch; and this in the play of muscles which would not 
generally be regarded as susceptible of the highest 
delicacy of such co-ordination. But how far is he con- 
scious where the co-ordinations are taking place? His 
business is to keep the sights in line; how this is 
subconsciously managed he is probably completely un- 
aware. 
And in the training of skill, do we not know from 
experience that an ounce of demonstration is worth many 
pounds of description. And when we do call in descrip- 
tion as supplementary to demonstration we make no 
attempt to describe, even if we can do so, the motor ad- 
justments; we deal with their effects. In teaching a boy 
to play billiards, we mingle some description with our 
demonstration; but it has reference rather to what he 
has to do, than to the subconscious means by which it 
is done. We say, “ Hold your cue thus, strike your own 
ball here, moderately hard, and aim to hit the red on 
this chalk mark I make on it.” He plays and fails. He 
explains that the failure was due to his striking his own 
ball too hard, and hitting the red too centrally and fully, 
and bid him try again. Gradually, after many trials, by 
subconsciously eliminating the errors of adjustment, he 
acquires the skill we would impart. But his attention 
has been fixed throughout on the effects produced by 
co-ordination, not on any details of the motor adjust- 
ments themselves. 
And yet these motor adjustments, not indeed in their
-P-A-G-E-120
106 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
details, but in their net results, enter into the web of 
subconscious correlation with sufficient accuracy to enable 
one to correct errors of co-ordination. Make a chalk 
mark near the centre of a blackboard, stand at a distance 
of ten paces, and, having taken a clear view of it, shut 
your eyes and point your finger at the chalk spot. You 
feel the movements of your arm (probably visualise the 
finger), and on opening the eyes find perhaps that you 
are pointing a little too low and to one side. Again shut 
your eyes and repeat the operation anew. You will prob- 
ably find that you have somewhat over-corrected the 
previous error. But how could you have done this unless 
the net results of the motor adjustments afforded data 
taking effect in the marginal region of the field of con- 
scfousness ? 
There is one more general point to be noticed with 
regard to skill, especially with regard to those forms 
which are the outcome of intercourse. A good deal of 
the correlation involved has anticipatory value. Shortly 
after the ball has left the hand of the bowler, the batsman 
is prepared to strike in a certain way. Of course he is 
still on the alert; for the ball may shoot, and this will 
necessitate a rapid and special modification of the play. 
So, too, the fencer knows from the first movement of the 
button of his adversary’s foil what is likely to follow; 
such a movement has acquired meaning; and the antag- 
onist he fears most is the master of newly devised meth- 
ods, the initial stages of which have not acquired such 
meaning. 
It will be remembered that in the second chapter (p. 
40) we reached a formula of wide range and running 
thus: Preparation; Presentation; Assimilation; Applica- 
tion. All training in skill affords an exemplification of 
this formula. The distinguishing feature of the assimila-
-P-A-G-E-121
  
PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE 107 
tion here, as throughout the whole range of practical ex- 
perience as such, is that it takes place in the absence of 
any intentional analysis of the situations of daily life 
with the end in view of disentangling certain features com- 
mon to diverse situations, and using them for the framing 
of a systematic scheme of knowledge. Experience grows 
by a sort of selective coalescence, by which new presenta- 
tions are directly assimilated, so as to render possible a 
nicer and more delicate application of practical activities. 
This is the kind of coalescent assimilation which occurs 
when skill becomes more perfect through practice. In- 
deed, skilled behaviour (the skill itself, exclusive of any 
rational purpose which it may subserve) affords perhaps 
the best example of effective experience, gained almost 
wholly independently of systematic knowledge. In much 
of our adult life “knowledge about” overlies the more 
direct “experience of ” things and events. Their signifi- 
cance for a system of thought comes to have for us more 
importance than their meaning for very practical be- 
haviour. This is, however, less the case in matters of 
bodily skill dependent on abundant, direct, and un- 
analysed experience. Slightly vary the situation, so 
that the familiar application is no longer adapted to 
the presentation, and there results failure, all the more 
impressive since it cannot be readily explained; for 
explanation is a function of the system of knowledge 
which we are supposing to be relatively absent or in 
abeyance. 
I used to ride a tricycle; for many years I have ridden 
a bicycle. After an accident a friend offered to lend 
me a tricycle, and suggested that I should try it. TI 
did so, starting near the side of a road. I at once 
ran into the curb-stone. I remounted, and again 
turned the steering-wheel so as to run full tilt towards
-P-A-G-E-122
  108 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
the pavement. I tried the other side of the road, 
and ran into the pavement on that side. It was a 
sufficiently humiliating failure of skill in one who had 
said that he had ridden some thousands of miles on a 
tricycle. 
Not without difficulty, I applied systematic knowledge 
to explain the failure, analysing the situation to find the 
exact locus of error. Believing that I had the clue, I 
then, to test the conclusion at which I had arrived, 
started in the middle of the road on the crown of its 
arch. I found that I proceeded on a straight course, 
so far verifying the results of my analysis. What is the 
interpretation? In turning a corner on a bicycle one is 
leaning over or inclined from the vertical in that direction 
to which one turns the handle-bar and front wheel. If 
a sudden gust of wind makes one lean over, one recovers 
by turning the bar in that direction. If one overdoes it, 
inertia causes one to incline to the opposite side, giving 
rise to a wobbling and sinuous course. Such inclination 
from the vertical, as a presentation, thus comes to mean 
for one’s cycling experience a definite application in turn- 
ing the handle-bar. The whole becomes closely coalescent 
in practice, though one may have no knowledge of the 
why and wherefore. Now when one mounts a tricycle and 
starts near the side of an arched road, the machine is 
leaning towards the pavement, one of the side wheels 
being on a higher part of the road than the other; and 
this presentation is inevitably followed by the customary 
bicycle application: one turns the bar automatically, and 
finds oneself with ridiculous pertinacity running into the 
pavement. In the middle of the road one’s position is 
vertical, for the two side wheels are level. The leaning 
presentation is absent, and there is no tendency to turn 
the bar. Then one feels better.

PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE 109 
The practical behaviour of those eminently practical 
beings, little children, is almost entirely dependent on 
experience due to coalescent assimilation without anal- 
ysis, and untroubled at first by any of the explanations 
which are the applications of systematic knowledge. 
And many cases of apparent stupidity are due to the fact 
that the presentation of a new situation is not correctly 
assimilated to the previous experience of apparently (to 
us) similar, but really slightly different, situations. I 
will give an example from animal life, suggesting that 
many analogous cases may be found in the study of the 
behaviour of children. 
Dr. Alex. Hill’s fox-terrier Peter was taught to open 
the side door of a large box by lifting a projecting latch. 
When the door swung open he was never allowed to 
find anything in the box, but was given a piece of bis- 
cuit from the hand. The development of the situation 
was always to the end of thus obtaining a bit of biscuit 
outside the box. One day a well-browned, hot, redolent 
chop-bone was put inside the box, which was placed in 
a courtyard so that the dog would pass it when nobody 
was near, though he could be watched from a window. 
Details of the dog’s behaviour are given by Dr. Hill in 
Nature (April 16, 1903, page 558). The net result was 
that the dog failed to apply at once his quite familiar 
experience of lifting the latch in the usual way. The 
situation, lonely box, and exciting grilled bone inside was 
not assimilated to the familiar box-master-biscuit situ- 
ation, and the central feature common to both—the lifted 
latch—was not grasped. He had no experience of finding 
bones, or anything to eat, inside; the meaning of lifting 
the latch was always, for him, the getting of a piece of 
biscuit from outside, and he failed to draw the conclusion, 
so obvious to us, that opening the door was the key to 
 
-P-A-G-E-124
110 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
the practical problem before him. He failed to assimilate 
the new presentations to his previous experience—or so 
it seemed. We may perhaps infer that he did not ana- 
lytically compare the two situations so as to disentangle 
the essential feature common to both. 
Many cases of apparent stupidity in children (an in- 
teresting field of inquiry) may be explained on similar 
lines. They are due to incapacity or temporary failure 
to grasp analytically some important feature embodied in 
the presented situation—a feature obvious enough to us, 
but not seen by them, as the hinge on which the success- 
ful application of experience turns. 
Now a great deal of early education is concerned with 
the imparting of skill, and it is difficult to exaggerate 
the importance of a varied training in this respect. It 
is unquestionably part of the means by which the 
individual is brought into vital touch with his environ- 
ment. Involving as it does the constant correlation of 
the data of sense, and the nice co-ordination of motor 
activities; essentially practical and in close touch with 
real things; fostering habits alike of close observation 
and of accuracy of performance; necessitating the steady 
application of means to a definite end in view; lend- 
ing itself admirably to an elementary appreciation of 
the value of accuracy, and fostering a desire for its 
attainment ;—on all these grounds a training and skill 
should form a prominent feature in our educational 
system. 
For the training of the finger muscles, Sléjd, drawing, 
and the playing of a musical instrument—best of all, if 
there is a good ear for music, the violin—are admirable. 
The wider and more varied the training, the better; for 
our object is to give to the fingers a skill which may 
eventually be applied to anything from tying a knot or a
-P-A-G-E-125
  PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE 111 
white tie, or sewing on a button, to the most delicate 
touches of art on the one hand, to the equally delicate 
touches of scientific manipulation on the other hand. 
I asked my dentist some time ago how he maintained 
such wonderful delicacy of control over his finger muscles. 
“Chiefly by practising scales on the piano,” was his reply. 
Does not this indicate the kind of answer which may 
be given to some of those short-sighted people who are 
always asking what is the good of this or that training 
for future life? If piano-drill is of value for the practice 
of dentistry, may not other forms of training find their 
application in quite unexpected ways? Whenever I find 
a student who displays unusual delicacy in dissection, I 
inquire how he or she has trained the finger-muscles so 
as to have them so well under control. Often I have 
received for answer that they have not been specially 
trained in any way. But on further inquiry I have 
generally elicited such answers as, “Oh yes, I’m fond of 
drawing—just sketching things that strike me, without 
any knowledge of his subject,” or “ Well, I’ve always been 
rather given to carving boats, and the knobs of sticks, 
and odd things, but I never learnt to do so.” No doubt 
such answers indicate a natural gift which has found 
expression in these ways; no doubt there may be some 
whose fingers are, by nature, “all thumbs,” but probably 
if these “thumbs” are only trained at a sufficiently 
early and plastic stage of development, they will, in 
nine cases out of ten, turn out to be very respectable 
fingers. 
And we must never forget the value of this delicacy of 
skill—which must in some way be trained in early life— 
in its application to much tHat is highest in human en- 
. deavour. In many departments both of art and science, 
skill is essential as the medium of expression of that
-P-A-G-E-126
  112 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
which takes form in the mind of the artist or man of 
science. In painting, technique may be inferior in worth 
to inspiration; but of what value to mankind is the 
inspiration of the painter or sculptor if his skill in 
technique is inadequate to embody his ideal? What 
do we not owe to the marvellous interpretative skill of 
such a pianist as Paderewski, or such a violinist as 
Joachim or Lady Hallé? How much of the value of 
anatomy and surgery to man would be excluded if we 
failed to include the marvellous skill in their application 
which characterises a great operator? Of physical science 
it is scarcely too much to say that it owes its present 
position to the application of skill to the making of 
delicate apparatus, and the execution of experiments 
of extreme nicety. Skill in the manufacture and skill 
in the use of the microscope have done much to make 
biology what it now is. In a word, skill is the faithful 
and unwearied handmaiden which ministers both to 
science and to art. 
For the training of the larger, coarser body-muscles, 
Swedish drill, the gymnasium dancing, and our national 
games are of the utmost value; and to these the exer- 
cises of the kindergarten may readily be made to lead up. 
What our national games have done for the English race 
it is difficult to over-estimate. Apart from contributing 
to the development of a serviceable body of practical 
experience, they play a definite part in the organisation 
of intercourse. They afford a valuable discipline in what 
may be termed social co-ordination. An old soldier stand- 
ing by my side during a well-contested school match once 
said to me, “ That’s the training for our future soldiers 
and sailors.” A good football team, a good eleven, a good. 
eight, work together for a common aim, and learn to 
combine their skill with due co-ordination and due sub-
-P-A-G-E-127
PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE 113 
ordination. The playing-fields are the finest school of 
organised co-operation in the world. 
It should, of course, be remembered that I am dealing 
with the development of a body of experience, having 
real value under the conditions of social intercourse. I 
am not at present concerned with the development of a_ 
system of intellectual knowledge. And in urging the 
importance of our national games, in their proper place, 
I do not mean to imply that this should be regarded, as 
by some it seemingly is regarded, the place of supreme 
honour. To say that our national games have real educa- 
tional value is not to say that they should monopolise 
the attention either of boys or their parents. When 
they have fulfilled their educational function they should 
drop into a subordinate position, though they may form 
a basis of recreation, and the training they have afforded 
may be of life-long value both to those who would other- 
wise lead too sedentary a life, and to those whose future 
career may demand other applications of the skill and 
temper and social co-operation they have helped to 
develop. 
We may now return to the question which was put 
some pages back, and summarise the answer. That 
question was: What are we to understand by the terms 
“percept,” “perception,” and “ perceptual process”? Let 
us start with the “impression,” remembering that this 
term has reference to a “factor” disclosed by analysis 
within a larger “ presentation.” Such a presentation 
forms part of what we spoke of as a developing “ situa- 
tion.” When an impression carries “meaning” in terms 
of previous experience, it is raised to the level of a 
percept. But this is still only a factor within a larger 
whole which we have termed a “ disposition.” A disposi- 
tion is the sum of a number of factors. The term has
-P-A-G-E-128
  114 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
subjective reference to the person who has the experience; 
while the situation has objective reference to that which 
is being experienced. To deal in some way with an im- 
pression, in accordance with its meaning, is characteristic 
of the first stage of perception. Since, at the outset, 
meaning is always for some form of practical behaviour, 
perception involves kinesthetic factors. Such factors 
are probably never absent in the primary genesis of per- 
ception. To deal surely and effectively with the familiar 
situations of daily life, in accordance with their immediate 
and direct value for practical experience, is the outcome 
of perceptual process. 
The eminently practical experience so gained is, as 
mental development proceeds, made subservient to intel- 
lectual ends; and behaviour is modified in relation to 
schemes of ideal construction, involving considerations 
extending beyond the immediate situation. The stages 
of development of this higher ideational process we shall 
have hereafter to consider. At present they are not in 
the field of our special attention. We have been dealing, 
for example, with manipulative skill, and control over the 
bodily activities, independently of the intellectual pro- 
cesses which they may subserve, or with only such allusion 
to these processes as may serve to show how important 
practical experience is as the handmaid to her mistress, 
the intellect. And in some branches of educational pro- 
cedure special stress should at first be laid on homely 
meaning, in terms of the correlation of the data of 
experience, the emphasis on intellectual significance 
being reserved for a later period, or but sparingly 
introduced. 
In the early stages of science teaching the aim should 
be to develop rather a body of practical experience than 
a ‘system of scientific knowledge. In the chemical and
-P-A-G-E-129
PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE 115 
physical laboratory it is familiarity with processes of 
manipulation, and a direct acquaintance with how things 
react on each other, and how they behave under given 
circumstances, that have to be acquired by the pupil, so 
that he expects this or that result in just the same way 
as he expects what the football or cricket bat will do as 
he uses them in the playing-fields. But often the teacher 
is so saturated with systematic principles, and so eager 
that the pupils should reach scientific conceptions, that 
he hurries on to impress on young minds the significance 
of phenomena for the system of knowledge before the phe- 
nomena themselves have acquired homely meaning for the 
situations of the laboratory. 
There is also a tendency, among some advocates of 
science teaching, to lay so much emphasis on the value 
of chemical and physical experiment and manipulation as 
to ignore the claims of such observation as is fostered by 
nature-study, while even those who urge the importance 
of nature-study make it from the first too rigidly system- 
atic and too scientific; too much botanical, or zoological, 
or geological; too little the acquirement of a direct 
practical, unexplained and, as yet, inexplicable acquaint- 
ance with the sequence of natural events. Nature-study 
for quite little folk is not elementary botany or zoology, 
or any other ’ology. It is a body of practical experience 
which may some day be interpreted in the light of 
scientific conceptions. It is, frankly, observational, and 
deals with the how of natural processes and events in 
garden, field, hedgerow, and upland moor, by the pond- 
side and at the seashore—not at all with their why. 
That is systematic science, not nature-study, the aim of 
which should be to establish a number of correlations 
among the data which experience in the country affords. 
But it must be real experience, not information alone, 
   
-P-A-G-E-130
  116 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
though information may and should be given as an indi- 
cation of what to observe, and as a descriptive aid to 
observation in progress. And here again we must bear 
in mind how unreasonable it is to turn children out into 
the country and expect them to observe without any 
previous guidance as to what to look out for—any indica- 
tion of the lines along which observation should be 
directed. For assimilation to take place there must be a 
congruent body of experience which shall play its part 
in the process. The new things to be observed must be 
related to what has already been assimilated. In other 
words, for fruitful observation there should be due pre- 
paration. With minds prepared by descriptive informa- 
tion, closely related to what has been previously acquired 
by direct contact with nature, children are able to as- 
similate what would otherwise pass unnoticed. And such 
experience should be gained in the early days of life, 
when the mind is plastic and correlations of all sorts are 
readily established, and when the links of association hold 
firmly. It is difficult for the teacher in training for 
elementary school work to acquire in the limited time at 
his disposal this kind of familiarity with nature. Work 
in the classroom will not give it: lectures, though they 
may stimulate and guide observation, and be really help- 
ful to those who use them as subsidiary aids to and pre- 
paration for actual experience, by themselves merely 
afford information about nature, not the intimate and 
first-hand acquaintance with living things which is 
wanted. In the upper and middle classes it is to the 
mother and the governess that children should look for 
help and encouragement in gaining a form of practical 
experience which will be a life-long source of pleasure. 
But too often they look in vain!. How many parents, 
themselves ignorant of the fresh and simple meaning

of a thousand occurrences in the cycle of the year, 
consider it worth while to inquire whether the gover- 
ness whom they engage for the education of their 
children has any intimate acquaintance with such 
matters.
-P-A-G-E-132
CHAPTER V 
SYSTEMATIC KNOWLEDGE—IDEAL CONSTRUCTION 
In the practical experience which was considered in the 
last chapter we deal with concrete situations as wholes. 
It is true that each situation has a centre of interest in 
accordance with the meaning it possesses for the purposes 
of behaviour. But we need not, and generally do not 
analytically consider the relation of this centre to the 
rest of the situation, at the moment of prompt and 
vigorous action. To do so we must analyse our experi- 
ence, and such analysis is a necessary step towards the 
higher synthesis implied in a system of knowledge. 
When we analyse a substance chemically we split it up 
into its constituent elements. We may examine a drop 
of water with the highest powers of the microscope, 
and we shall not be able to distinguish the constituent 
oxygen from the constituent hydrogen. But when we 
take pure water and by appropriate means analyse it 
chemically, we separate the constituent hydrogen from 
the constituent oxygen. We may term this kind of 
analysis dissociating analysis. But if instead of pure 
water we select such a substance as a piece of granite, 
we may analyse it to some extent without submitting it to 
the process of chemical dissociation. By careful examina- 
tion with the naked eye or with a lens, we may distin- 
guish the constituent minerals, the quartz, the mica, the 
118 E
-P-A-G-E-133
SYSTEMATIC KNOWLEDGE 119 
felspar, and so forth. We do not dissociate them in this 
case, we leave them just as they were; we merely distin- 
guish them. And in doing so, we may fix our attention 
first on the quartz, to the subordination of the mica and 
the felspar; then on the mica, to the subordination of the 
other two constituents; and then on the felspar in like 
manner. This we may call distinguishing analysis, as 
contrasted with the dissociating analysis of chemistry. 
From the psychological point of view it is with dis- 
tinguishing analysis that we are chiefly concerned, though 
dissociating analysis may be, and often is, employed as a 
means or an aid to help us or our pupils to distinguish 
more clearly. For example, in dealing with a plant we 
teach a child to distinguish roots, stem, leaves, and flowers, 
and within the flower to distinguish bracts, petals, stamens, 
and pistil. But as an aid to making the distinctions 
clear, we may dissect the flower and separate the parts. 
In either case we successively make predominant some 
particular factor or group of factors in a complex whole, 
and bring out the relationships of the several factors to 
each other within the whole. This involves comparison 
of the several parts. And when we lead the child to 
compare a number of flowers, we help him to frame a 
schematic flower, not perhaps exactly corresponding, point 
for point, to any particular blossom, pimpernel, bean, 
snapdragon, or daisy, but such that any one of these may 
be regarded as differing examples falling within the flower- 
scheme. The schematic flower is a product of ideal con- 
struction; the child who frames it has some systematic 
knowledge. The course of procedure in such a case is 
from the whole as presented to naive experience; through 
the distinguishing of parts, properties, or qualities, to the 
reconstituted whole as presented to systematic knowledge. 
Now the phrase “ ideal construction ” carries with it the
-P-A-G-E-134
120 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
implication that the constituent factors are ideas. The 
nature of ideas, as contrasted with images, was indicated 
in the first chapter. But we must understand how they 
are formed in the child-mind, and how we minister to 
their formation. Analytic comparison is essential to the 
process, and to this end there must, in the objects dealt 
with, be points of similarity notwithstanding difference, 
and points of difference in the midst of similarity. The 
things must be comparable, but they must also be distin- 
guishable. In the kindergarten we place before children 
a number of objects; some are round, some square, some 
triangular; some are red, some green, some blue; some 
are made of paper, some of metal, some of flannel. Any 
given object is both red, square, and made of flannel; or 
blue, round, and made of paper; and so forth. We group 
the reds, greens, and blues together irrespective of shape 
and material, and, after mingling the objects again indis- 
eriminately, bid the children group the colours. In doing 
so we render this particular character predominant for 
the children’s attention. Then we classify again in respect 
of shape; and subsequently once again in accordance 
with material. Perhaps some of the children make mis- 
takes; put blues or papers together in a class, when we 
tell them to select all the squares. We correct their 
errors. And we help our pupils to grasp that though 
shape, colour, and material are combined in every object, 
yet for the immediate purpose in hand one matters, while 
the others do not matter. In a colour classification shape 
and material do not matter: in a shape grouping, the 
colour which mattered so much just now, no longer 
matters. The abstract idea of some quality is that which 
at the moment matters; other qualities are present, but 
they don’t matter. But when the “ does-matter ” idea of 
blue is disengaged, it is not only abstract but general.
-P-A-G-E-135
SYSTEMATIC KNOWLEDGE 121 
It applies to all the blue objects and to any blue object. 
Any particular case is just an example of blueness. And 
the disengaged ideas are free to combine in new ways. 
It so happens that, among the objects, there is no example 
of a triangular green bit of flannel. But by putting the 
three ideas together in constructive synthesis the child 
can picture what such an object would be like if there 
were one. Such synthesis is a simple case of ideal con- 
struction. 
Now let us suppose that children are receiving 
elementary instruction in length or in weight. There is 
a further exercise in comparison. This piece of string is 
longer than that piece of worsted; the material does not 
matter, length does. This cube of cork is lighter than 
that round bullet. The fact that it is larger does not 
matter; but it will matter if we are dealing, not with 
weight but with size. Longer, shorter; heavier, lighter; 
larger, smaller, involve the relationships of things to each 
other in certain selected respects. When we say that a 
swift is bigger than a sand-martin, one strawberry sweeter 
than another, one note struck on the piano higher than 
another, selected relationships are involved. There is in 
each case a transition in experience which is of a 
certain appreciable kind. In cases of deliberate com- 
parison we go to and fro from one to the other perhaps 
several times. In tuning the second string of a violin to 
the A note on the piano we alternately pluck or bow the 
string and touch the piano key. After a while we are 
satisfied that the transition in experience, though it in- 
volves a difference in timbre (which does not matter), is 
from like to like in pitch. And what our attention is 
fixed upon is this relation of the two notes. We feel, too, 
that the consonance is what we want; that we have pro- 
duced a particular example of what we understand, by 
 
-P-A-G-E-136
122 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
the term “ similarity.” Ideas of relationship are essential 
factors in systematic knowledge, 
It must be remembered that we so habitually think in 
terms of the relationships which in the course of our 
systematic education have been rendered explicit, that it 
is somewhat difficult for us to realise the mental position 
of the animal and the little child for whom they are still 
merely incidental and implicit. Size, weight, distance, 
position, and so forth, have relational meaning before they 
acquire relational significance. The bigger thing simply 
means a wider grasp; the heavier thing, more output of 
energy; the more distant thing, a longer reach; the thing 
on one side, a movement of the eyes or limbs or body as 
a whole in that direction. Only when the relationships 
involved in such procedure are disentangled so as to be 
compared with other like relationships, does the particular 
case acquire significance for a systematic scheme of sizes, 
or weights, or distances. The first step, then, towards a 
system of knowledge, is the disentangling of relations, with 
a view to their comparison; and this involves rendering 
them explicit and making them special objects of atten- 
tion. 
Using the word “ perception” in the sense indicated in 
the last chapter, according to which the “ percept” is an 
impression which has acquired practical meaning, the ques- 
tion arises whether we may consistently apply this term 
to the initial phases of the process we are now considering. 
Perception deals with the concrete situation; and unques- 
tionably the relationships within the concrete situation are 
the first to be grasped. It is always the relation between 
this and that object presented to the child’s experience 
that we seek to bring out clearly. True it is that the 
end we have in view is the attainment by the child of 
systematic knowledge; but assuredly the child has, as yet, »?
-P-A-G-E-137
SYSTEMATIC KNOWLEDGE 123 
no conception of that end. True it is that we have here 
the means by which abstract ideas are reached; but they 
are here only just being disengaged from concrete experi- 
ence. It seems, therefore, justifiable to distinguish two 
stages in the perceptual process: first, that in which the 
relations involved are as yet implicit and embedded in the 
situation which has meaning for practical experience; and 
secondly, that in which the relations are rendered explicit, 
but still as constituent factors in a concrete embodiment. 
This stage we may speak of as that of the perception of 
relations. In the former edition of this book I restricted 
my use of the term “ perception” to the latter stage. But 
I do not propose here to press a usage which in some 
respects runs counter to that of other writers. If we 
regard the rendering explicit of the relations in practical 
experience as the final stage of perception; we may also 
regard it as the initial step towards the higher and more 
complex process of ideal construction; and we may thus 
understand how practical experience and systematic knowl- 
edge are closely linked together. 
It may be well to set forth briefly the stages of develop- 
ment beyond the bare impression, remembering that the 
impression itself is only a factor in a larger presentative 
situation. 
1. Formation of percepts of the first grade (impression 
plus meaning), and of corresponding images within the 
body of practical experience. 
2. Disentanglement of qualities and relations through 
comparison. The perception of relations leading to the 
formation of free ideas. 
3. Further analysis of a complex presentation into 
factors (ideas) in relation to each other and to the whole. 
4. Recombination through constructive synthesis into 
concepts.
-P-A-G-E-138
124 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
5. Building of concepts into a related system through 
further ideal construction. 
6. Apperception of concrete case as an example or illus- 
tration of some portion of the system of knowledge. P 
The term concept is introduced under the fourth heading. 
We will understand by conception the synthetic process by 
which general and abstract ideas are put together so as 
to form a more complex whole for thought. Ideas are 
thus reached by the analysis of experience: concepts are 
reached by a synthesis of ideas. The word “animal,” for 
example, answers to a concept; and in a definition of the 
term the leading constituent ideas are enumerated. As 
we shall presently have occasion to see, however, ideas and 
concepts are very closely related, as are also ideational 
and conceptual process. Apperception is the technical 
term which may be applied to the realisation that some 
particular case is, as stated under the sixth heading, an 
example or illustration of, let us say, some general rule or 
principle. Happy the boy who thus apperceives the rider 
set in a geometry paper. If, when we see a bee entering 
a sage-flower, we regard the procedure as affording an 
instance of the fertilisation of flowers by insects, we apper- 
ceive its biological significance. Again, Tennyson’s lines— 
“His honour rooted in dishonour stood, 
And faith unfaithful kept him falsely true,” 
may be apperceived as affording examples of the figure of 
oxymoron. In perception there is meaning for practical 
experience: in apperception there is significance for a 
system of knowledge. There is assimilation of the par- 
ticular case in relation to the ideal construction (apper- 
ceptive assimilation); and there is application of the 
system of knowledge as throwing light upon the special 
example before us.
-P-A-G-E-139
SYSTEMATIC KNOWLEDGE 125 
It will be remembered that towards the close of the 
second chapter a distinction was drawn between spon- 
taneous attention and the will to attend. The latter 
implies the existence of some motive or motives for attend- 
ing. These motives have to be taken into consideration. 
Some more or less systematic plan of life has taken shape 
as an ideal construction. The value of attention is apper- 
ceived in relation to wider ends, which embrace far more 
than is comprised within the particular situation of the 
moment. Again, in the last chapter a distinction was 
drawn between the practical meaning, in terms of direct 
observation, which experiments in the chemical laboratory 
may acquire, that is to say, the expectation begotten of 
experience that certain results will follow; and the sig- 
nificance that these results may have for a systematic 
knowledge of chemical reactions. We may now say 
that, when this significance is grasped, the particular 
case is apperceived as an example which illustrates some 
general principle. So, too, in the case of the failure of 
adjustment of bicycle practice to, the altered circum- 
stances of riding a tricycle; it is only when the facts 
can be explained that there is any apperceptive as- 
similation. This, indeed, is involved whenever there is 
interpretation. 
Whenever, therefore, a particular example is regarded as 
a case which falls under and illustrates a universal prin- 
ciple, a general rule, a natural law, a moral ideal, a canon 
of art, we have apperceptive assimilation. But this implies 
that the general principle has already been reached 
by comparison (involving analysis and abstraction) and 
through generalisation (involving synthetic construction). 
These fall under the category of ideational and conceptual 
process, as distinguished from the less complex type of 
perceptual process which is involved in the simpler and
-P-A-G-E-140
126 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
more direct forms of assimilation within the sphere of 
naive practical experience. 
Let us now bring this into line with the schematic for- 
mula given in previous chapters (pp. 40 and 106). We 
have Preparation; Presentation; Apperceptive Assimila- 
tion; Application. But since apperceptive assimilation 
involves comparison and generalisation, the formula may 
be written thus: Preparation; Presentation; Comparison ; 
Generalisation; Application. We thus reach what is only 
a modification of the five formal steps of Herbart. The 
preparation at this stage of mental development is in itself 
in large measure ideational. But it implies also an 
adequate preparation in the perceptual experience which 
is its precursor. Just as racial preparation is a pre- 
requisite of instinctive behaviour, and just as instinctive 
behaviour affords a preparation for intelligent modes of 
application, so does concrete experience of the perceptual 
order prepare the way for the higher ideational process. 
This does not, of course, exclude the important truth that 
yesterday’s ideational process forms part of the prepara- 
tion for to-day’s fuller apperceptive assimilation. We 
must not accept any schematic formula in a narrow and 
pedantic spirit. In a sense it may be said that when once 
systematic knowledge has begun to take form, it so suffuses 
itself over the whole range of mental operations as to raise 
the formula to a higher intellectual level in all its terms. 
In educational procedure the preparation takes the form 
of calling up into the field of consciousness of the pupil 
such portion of the systematic knowledge he already pos- 
sesses as shall be relevant to the new presentations which 
are introduced. These are then dealt with by the idea- 
tional process skilfully and sympathetically, guided by the 
teacher, so that there shall follow apperceptive assimila- 
tion with the attendant expansion of the growing system
-P-A-G-E-141
SYSTEMATIC KNOWLEDGE 127 
of knowledge, which is then tested by gauging the pupil’s 
ability to apply it to new cases and further examples. 
There is always a danger, however, lest a rational 
formula should degenerate into a prescribed formulary. 
The Herbartian steps are, I believe, based on secure 
psychological foundations. But they are sometimes 
pedantically regarded as a rigid mould into which every 
lesson must be squeezed. And some of the model lessons 
given in text-books show the distortion which results from 
an undue emphasis on the letter of the law to the exclu- 
sion of its essential spirit. The quick insight of the born 
teacher enables him to detect the faults of his brother who 
has merely been made on a stereotyped pattern. And he 
is led to exclaim: “ Better the unmethodical procedure of 
mother wit than the methodism of all his formal training.” 
His attitude of impatience is not unnatural. But even 
the born teacher will perchance find the spirit of the 
Herbartian formula vital with quickening interest if he 
will submit its leading principles to a process of appercep- 
tive assimilation or mental digestion. And, after all, there 
are not enough born teachers to go round. We must 
make the best of a pretty considerable percentage of 
merely manufactured articles, with all their faults and 
formalisms. 
Granted, then, that some such formula as has been 
suggested should appeal to the teacher as worthy of his 
consideration, even then he must be careful to interpret 
and apply it with tact and judgment. Perhaps the chief 
difficulties of interpretation are due to the fact that the 
modes of application in behaviour or conduct which I have 
attempted logically to distinguish as instinctive, intelligent 
(or perceptual), and intellectual (or ideational), are, in 
child life, frequently in co-operative inter-relation. There 
is not any given epoch at which the instinctive procedure
-P-A-G-E-142
128 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
due to racial preparation ceases and gives place to intel- 
ligent behaviour due to the preparation afforded by naive 
experience; nor is there a succeeding epoch when intelli- 
gent behaviour is entirely supplanted by rational and sys- 
tematic conduct. Instinct affords the basis on which in- 
telligence is founded: perceptual behaviour in the concrete 
situations of practical life yields the material for analytic 
treatment to the end of attaining systematic knowledge. 
Intelligence is constantly utilising all that is the outcome 
of a prolonged racial preparation: rational conduct involves 
the fullest possible use of all that has been gained by sim- 
pler modes of experience. Child life and adult life are one 
and continuous. The interpreter has to analyse out the 
factors, estimate their relative values, and recombine them 
in the ideal constructions of synthetic treatment. This is 
no light or easy task. And he who would attempt it must 
call to his aid all the resources at the command of the 
man of science and use them with all the sympathetic 
insight of the constructive artist. 
The inter-relation of the factors is again well seen in 
educational procedure. We recognise that descriptive 
work must go on side by side with explanation. The 
apprehension of descriptive work is relatively on the 
plane of naive perceptual experience, while the compre- 
hension of what is set forth in an explanation is apper- 
ceptive, and is wholly on the plane of ideational process 
and systematic knowledge. A due balance must be kept 
between the two. So, too, in the procedure of science, skill 
in manipulation is relatively on the perceptual plane. The 
purpose to which the skill is applied may be systematic 
and related to the increase of scientific knowledge. Here, 
again, the factors are in the closest relationship. But this 
does but emphasise the desirability of an analysis by which 
their distinctive features may be rendered clear.
-P-A-G-E-143
SYSTEMATIC KNOWLEDGE 129 
In the analytic comparison and synthetic generalisation 
which are necessary to all clear and accurate thought, 
the qualities or attributes of objects, and their relations 
to each other, are dealt with for a definite purpose, and 
with a distinctive end in view. This purpose or end may 
very probably not be foreseen by the pupil; but it should 
always be present to the mind of the teacher. And if his 
procedure be methodical and well-ordered, its significance 
will in due course be apperceived by those to whose intel- 
lectual development he ministers. 
Among the relationships which are implicit in the 
familiar situations of our daily life, are those which we 
term numerical and quantitative. The ideal constructions 
of mathematics enable us to deal with them in the light 
of systematic knowledge. It will be convenient to illus- 
trate from the simpler arithmetical operations the psycho- 
logical principles involved in ideational and conceptual 
‘process. But it must be remembered that my primary 
object is not to indicate how arithmetic should be taught, 
or how the number scheme which we employ first arose 
in the minds of men. 
All numerical operations are based in the first instance 
on a system of counting. Each count has a name, and 
also a symbol, for purposes of notation; both names and 
symbols are assigned on a systematic plan, in order that 
counting and notation up to the highest numbers may be 
facilitated. Two things, though obvious enough, are note- 
worthy: First, that the system is applicable to the count- 
ing of any objects or any operations ; apples, boys, shillings ; 
paces, elections, battles. Thus if a count of 5 be regarded 
as an operation, we may perform the operation seven times. 
Secondly, the order of counting is immaterial—not, of 
course, the order of naming or symbolising the counts, but 
the order in which the objects are selected for counting.
-P-A-G-E-144
130 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
It does not matter, for the number scheme, with which 
one begins, or with which one ends, so long as one counts 
each object, and counts it only once. The single object is 
termed the unit, and this unit may be quantitatively in- 
definite. Thus in counting boys or apples, their size and 
weight do not matter: each counts as a unit. 
Let us now take a simple case of the application of 
this system. ‘’e enter a room in which there are many 
people. For practical experience, in the absence of a 
numerical scheme, there is just an indefinite manyness of 
persons. A systematic operation makes this definite. 
How? First we part the individuals (by distinguishing 
analysis) into units; secondly, we count them, and find that 
our operation reaches its limit when we reach the number 
53. If we have counted them all, we have now a definite 
manyness expressed by the name fifty-three. Our analysis 
has been followed by a synthesis for the purpose in hand. 
But the result of such analysis and synthesis for the 
attainment of systematic knowledge is a concept. It 
involves the combination of the ideas “ unit ” and “ count- 
limit.” We now understand what is meant by saying that 
number is a concept, and that it is reached by a process of 
analysis and synthesis, or, as it is sometimes termed in this 
connection of “ parting and wholing.” We see, too, how 
the simple operation of counting is the application of 
a systematic number-scheme, which is an ideal construc- 
tion, to our concrete experience. 
Now suppose the people in the room are in groups. 
There are three in the first row, five in the second row, 
nine in the third row, and so on. We may then reach the 
number of persons by the addition of the numbers in the 
several groups. We have learnt, and the child has to 
learn, the result of adding group to group. These results 
are memorised: three and five are eight, and nine are
-P-A-G-E-145
  SYSTEMATIC KNOWLEDGE 131 
seventeen, and so forth. Such addition is a short-cut to 
save the labour of counting all the units: the addition sum 
is put down in a special way; and is by the child soon 
dealt with as part of an abstract number-scheme, irre- 
spective of what the numbers represent — apples, or 
marbles, or persons. With high numbers certain rules of 
“carrying” must be observed, and these can only be 
understood when the system of notatioa is adequately 
grasped. It is clear that addition, and its correlative sub- 
traction, are schematic modes of dealing with count-groups 
in accordance with certain general rules. 
The ideal construction of mathematics is raised to a 
higher level for systematic knowledge, when the unit itself 
is quantitatively definite; for example, when we speak of 
twelve inches, six pounds, and so forth. The unit is here 
of the same order as the whole under consideration. It is 
a quantitatively definite unit of weight, of length, of time, 
and so forth. Such units are indispensable for exact 
measurement. Again, let us take a particular case. I 
have a walking-stick, and I wish to know its length. Note 
the abstraction involved for our present purpose. Its 
thickness, its weight, its strength do not matter; nor does 
it matter whether it is of oak, cane, or blackthorn. From 
our special point of view there is just an indefinite much- 
ness of length. We require to make this definite. Com- 
parison is involved. But we are not merely comparing it 
with another stick, and saying that it is longer or shorter. 
We are comparing it in numerical terms with some selected 
standard of length, by means of which measurement may 
be made systematic and described in units of general 
validity. We take an exact unit of length, say an inch. 
We analyse the whole length dividing it up into unit 
parts, distinguishing but not separating (cutting off) these 
inch parts. Then we count them, and find that thirty-six
-P-A-G-E-146
  132 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
is the limit of our counting. We have now, by parting 
and wholing, reached a definite muchness of length. There 
is, indeed, a little bit over; but we may for the moment 
neglect that. 
This example serves to bring out the nature of quantity 
as continuous, while number is discrete. In continuous 
quantity we have to distinguish the unit parts, but need 
not separate them into a discrete number of parts. Still 
we only get a definite expression of quantity when we can 
give the number of unit parts which are present in the 
continuous whole. Even then there may be a bit over. 
What can we do with it? We can divide our unit as we 
divided our whole. Let us divide it into ten parts, and 
call each a tenth of an inch. We count the tenths in 
our bit over, and find that there are seven of them. That 
is sufficiently exact for getting the length of our stick. 
But for scientific purposes of measurement we may have 
again to divide our tenth of an inch into ten parts, which 
we call hundredths, and so on. If we are measuring the 
circumference of a circle in terms of the diameter as a 
quantitative unit, we find that there are three times the 
unit +1 tenth-+ 4 hundredths +1 thousandth + 5 ten 
thousandths + 9 hundred thousandths, and so on. But no 
matter how many times we divide the bit over into tenths 
or decimal parts, we never reach a limit to the process. 
The quantity cannot be numerically expressed with final 
accuracy in terms of this unit. But the approximate 
number we obtain is true of any circle regarded as an ideal 
construction—that is, one more perfect than any particular 
circle which was ever drawn. The expression in numerical 
terms, though we cannot attain a limit of exactness, is 
universally true of all circles. 
Measurement of quantity inevitably leads to fractional 
parts, and is the easiest educational avenue to the compre-
-P-A-G-E-147
SYSTEMATIC KNOWLEDGE 133 
hension of fractions, and the operations employed in deal- 
ing with them. A fractional part is termed a derived unit. 
Thus the inch is an example of a primary unit, and the 
tenth of an inch a derived unit. In vulgar fractions the 
value of the derived unit is seen in the denominator, and 
the number of times it has to be taken in the numerator. 
Thus $ is seven counts of 4 as a derived unit. What it 
is derived from depends on the kind of measurement, in 
inches, feet, miles; in pounds, ounces, grams; in days, 
hours, seconds; and so forth. Children should not at first 
be allowed to deal with any fractions without being helped 
to realise of what primary units they are fractional parts. 
Later on they may be taught to deal with fractions within 
an abstract number-scheme. They will then be sufficiently 
advanced to grasp that what the unit may be does not 
matter. The operations on fractions are the same in the 
abstract, whether they are fractions of seconds, of pounds 
avoirdupois, or of the distance of the sun from the earth, 
regarded as an astronomical unit. But I repeat, the child 
should, at first, be taught to deal with fractions by practical 
measurement. If we take a strip of paper a foot long and 
divide it into fourths, a second strip into eighths, and a 
third into sixteenths, the child may be easily led to see 
that 4, , and +5 are all of exactly the same length. He 
is thus led to compare; and he will learn that the same 
length may be expressed in more than one way, or that 
two or more expressions indicate operations leading to the 
same result. But he should clearly grasp that the opera- 
tions are different. It is not the same operation to divide 
the strip into eighths and into sixteenths; nor is it the 
same operation to take two counts of the one and four 
counts of the other. When the number-scheme is practi- 
cally applied, it depends entirely on the purpose in hand 
whether we divide into eighths or into sixteenths. But
-P-A-G-E-148
134 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
within the number-scheme the combined operations of 
parting and wholing give equivalent results. In this or 
in other ways the child may be introduced to the concep- 
tion of equivalence and its symbol. He may be led to 
grasp what is meant by saying § = 3. He will learn that 
the symbol for equality = always invites a comparison of 
the expressions it connects. Now for comparison, as we 
have seen, it is necessary that the objects of sense-per- 
ception or of thought shall be—(1) comparable, and (2) 
distinguishable. There must always be similarity notwith- 
standing difference, and difference in the midst of similar- 
ity. Here we have similarity of result, notwithstanding 
difference of operations. At a later stage, by comparing a 
number of such expressions, such as $= 3853 4 = gh, he 
will be led to see that the number of counts always varies 
inversely as the magnitude of the parts which are counted. 
He reaches a generalisation which is universally applic- 
able. It is on such generalisations that rules are founded. 
Under bad teaching the rules are learnt by heart, but the 
generalisations on which they are based are not under- 
stood. A boy, for example, may learn that to double the 
value of a fraction he may either halve the denominator 
or double the numerator. But why these different opera- 
tions should give the same result may remain an insoluble 
mystery. 
We shall revert to fractions and their equivalence 
presently. Let us now return to whole numbers. The 
child can count out twenty marbles. We tell him to 
count them out in equal groups of five, and then count 
the groups, of which he finds that there are four. Again, 
we bid him count them out in equal groups of four, and 
then count the groups; of which he finds that there 
are five. He will realise that four counts of five 
give the same result as five groups of four. It may be
-P-A-G-E-149
  SYSTEMATIC KNOWLEDGE 135 
convenient to put this before him in schematic form, 
thus: 
It does not matter, so far as the result is concerned, 
whether this expresses a group of four taken five times, 
or a group of five taken four times. The symbolic ex- 
pression is 4 X 5 = 5 X 4, or since this is true of any 
numbers it may be put in a more abstract form, a X 6 
= 0b X a, where a stands for any given number and b 
for any other given number. But we need a short-cut 
by which we can proceed at once from the number of 
counts in the group, and the number of times the group is 
taken, to the result. This short-cut (to avoid the labour 
of counting all the units seriatim) is the operation of 
multiplication. It involves the memorising of the multi- 
plication table and the application of certain rules. It 
forms no part of my purpose to enter into details. It 
suffices to note that we have a systematic method of deal- 
ing with counts of counts. If we wish to ascertain how 
many counts must be taken five times to give the whole 
number forty, or how many times a count of ten must be 
taken to. give forty, we employ the rules of division. In 
both division and multiplication we have parting and 
wholing, not only in counts but in counts of counts; and 
this involves a higher synthesis. 
I have drawn attention to the fact that the two sets 
of counts are interchangeable without affecting the result. 
Numerically, 4 x 52 = 52 X 4. Itis perhaps worth not- 
ing that though the order does not matter within the 
number-scheme, yet in practical life it might matter much. 
It might make a great difference to poor folk whether
-P-A-G-E-150
136 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
they were promised 4s. a week, or 52s. quarterly. They 
might be terribly pinched before the first quarter’s pay- 
ment was due. 
It may be well to carry the consideration of the 
number-scheme just one stage farther. This is the stage 
at which the unit is defined in quantitative terms of in- 
dependent value, when we speak, for example, of a pound 
of rice as worth 2d., or say that a cubic centimetre of 
water at a certain temperature weighs one gram. This 
enables us to bring the most diverse things into relation- 
ship for the purposes of our social life, and to compare 
wholly different units in terms of some third unit. The 
value of three acres of land is, let us suppose, 47s. Here 
the unit is implicitly defined, not in terms of area, but in 
terms of shillings. If I wish to know what is the value 
of twelve acres of adjoining land at the same rate, I have 
so to ,divide the twelve acres as to find out how many 
counts of three-acre groups there are in it. I find that 
there are four. I must therefore take four counts of the 
three-acre value, namely 47s. I thus get the value of the 
larger field—188s. Wherever we have units defined in 
terms of independent value we have to deal with counts 
of counts of counts. In the case above we have four 
counts of three counts (acres), each of which is, in value, 
forty-seven counts in shillings. Put in another way, we 
have to grasp that twelve acres is four times three acres, 
and that three acres is, in value, forty-seven times 1s. 
Let us, however, consider this example from a slightly 
different point of view. Remember that the essential 
feature of ideational process is that it involves com- 
parison, and that it also involves such analysis and 
synthesis as shall facilitate the comparison and render its 
outcome clear and definite. Now in the example I have 
taken we have first to compare a three-acre field and a
-P-A-G-E-151
  SYSTEMATIC KNOWLEDGE 137 
twelve-acre field in respect of their magnitude. We 
have seen that the concepts “3” and “12” imply the 
analysis into units and the synthesis named by the count- 
limit. When we compare the two fields we analyse both 
into the acre-unit, and combine the two analyses into one 
synthesis. The name given to this synthetic concept is 
ratio. We may write it, 3:12; but the essential point 
is that we have to regard this expression as that which sym- 
bolises one synthesis, and not two independent numbers or 
terms. We may also write it as a fraction, 74. Now a 
fraction is always a fraction of something. Take the case of 
the slip of paper which we divide into twelve parts, of which 
we take three. When we write #4 we mean three-twelfths 
of the whole slip. We are comparing a three-inch slip 
with a twelve-inch slip, and stating the ratio of the one 
to the other. And that is exactly what we are doing in 
the case of the three-acre field and the twelve-acre field. 
Here the three-acre field is what we start from. If we 
start from the twelve-acre field and compare the other 
with it, the ratio is 42. Suppose we started from it and 
compared it with a one-acre field, the ratio would be 42. 
This we write as the whole number twelve. Thus we 
shall understand what is meant by saying that every 
number is a ratio. 
But we have seen that a little familiarity with fractions 
enables us to grasp that 38 = 3%. What we do here is 
to compare the ratio 3%, with the ratio 3%. When they 
are equal the four terms are said to be proportional. The 
essential feature of proportion is the comparison of ratios. 
We have to take the expression as a whole, and grasp 
that it is symbolic of a higher synthesis. Each ratio is a 
synthesis: but the proportion is a synthesis of syntheses. 
We are now in a position to see the great importance of 
proportion when we are dealing with expressions involving
-P-A-G-E-152
  138 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
independent values. In the case of our fields we have 
zz = vss. Here we pass from the ratio comparing sizes 
in acres, to the ratio comparing values in shillings, and see 
that the sizes and values are proportional. 
It forms no part of my purpose to consider the methods 
of working sums in proportion. I must, indeed, again 
remind the teacher that my sole object is to illustrate 
from very elementary considerations of number and 
quantity, how by analysis, synthesis, and comparison we 
reach the ideal constructions which are applicable to the 
problems which are presented in the course of the practical 
experience of social life. Ratio and proportion are, as we 
have just seen, successive steps in analytic and synthetic 
procedure. Continuous proportion involves a higher syn- 
thesis. We have to grasp a series of numbers in which 
each bears the same ratio to the one which succeeds it. 
The numbers are, then, continuously proportional, or in 
geometrical progression. Thus 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, etc., are 
in geometrical progression, since } = 4 = 8; = 4§, ete. 
We have here successively counts, of counts, of counts of 
counts, etc., or 2, 2?, 2°, 24, ete. But enough has probably 
been said to show that every general rule involves a pro- 
cess of ideal construction, and that the value of such ideal 
construction is to enable us to deal with practical situations 
from a selected standpoint and for special purposes. 
Let us now consider how we reach systematic ideas 
and conceptions with regard to space. The relationships 
involved are implicit in practical experience. What 
becomes space for systematic knowledge is, for the dog 
or the little child, simply room to move about in, and 
room occupied by other objects which more or less restrict 
these movements or modify the behaviour. 
The field of vision is spread out before the eyes, and its 
spread corresponds to the spread of the retina. It is
-P-A-G-E-153
SYSTEMATIC KNOWLEDGE 139 
spoken of as extensity. Within the retinal extensity the 
constituent points are differentiated in such a way as 
severally to afford the stimuli to eye-movements ap- 
propriate to bring the point stimulated to the focus of 
vision. This differentiating feature is termed a local sign. 
The correlation of these local signs, within the extensity, 
with the kinesthetic factors due to eye-movements, give 
the visual field that meaning for practical experience 
which is implied in the word e«tension. Other correla- 
tions of the data afforded by convergence and accom- 
modation give, as we have seen, the meaning which is 
implied by the word “ distance.” The further correlation 
between these visual data and those of the fields of touch 
and free movements of the hands, arms, and body, gives 
extension and distance serviceable meaning for all the 
requirements of practical experience. 
We start, then, with such experience from which are 
extracted ideas of free movement, when there is room 
to move, and limitations of such movement due to the 
presence of other objects. We wish to frame an ideal 
construction which will enable us to deal systematically 
with the spatial relations. Let us proceed by the method 
of abstraction. Here is a blackboard. We will consider 
the possible movements on its surface. Of course other 
movements away from its surface are possible; but for 
our present purpose they do not matter. But there are 
an indefinite number of directions in which movements 
may take place on its surface. Any movement, however, 
must be either (1) up or (2) down, or (3) to right or (4) 
to left, or some combination of these, such as up and to the 
right, or down and to the left. We thus, by analysis and 
synthesis, obtain four, and only four, uncompounded direc- 
tions; all others are compounds of two of them. But up 
and down are directly opposite directions; as are also
-P-A-G-E-154
  140 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
right and left. We need a term which shall include the to 
and fro in opposite directions. That term is dimension. 
On the blackboard surface, then, there are four primary 
directions in two dimensions. 
But “up and down,” “right and left ” have reference to 
our own position as we stand erect and face the board. 
In further ideal construction this personal reference is 
superseded. For dealing with movements in flat-land, or 
any position therein, reference is made to two dimensions. 
We may, for simplicity, assume that the two aves, from 
which measurements are made, are at right angles, one 
vertical and the other horizontal. But they need not be 
horizontal and vertical; nor need they be at right angles. 
Much mathematical work has reference to oblique axes. 
There must, however, be two axes; the plane surface of flat- 
land has always, for ideal construction, two dimensions. 
Now let us leave the surface of the blackboard and 
consider the other possible movements which we have 
so far purposely neglected. How many other possible 
primary and uncompounded directions are there? Only 
two—away from the surface into the room or in the 
opposite direction through the thickness of the board. 
They may be also up or down, to right or to left; or 
more generally, for a special scheme, within the two 
dimensions already considered. The two new directions 
constitute for ideal construction a third dimension, which 
may, but need not, be at right angles to the plane of the 
other two. Every direction and every position in the 
space of which we have practical experience may be 
defined in terms of these three dimensions, the outcome 
of our ideal construction framed for the purpose of dealing 
accurately with positions and changes of position. 
Reverting to our blackboard, its surface, which the 
carpenter has made smooth and flat, has no thickness.
-P-A-G-E-155
SYSTEMATIC KNOWLEDGE 141 
It is the boundary between wood and air; and our 
idea of it as such is reached by abstraction. Of course 
' if there were no board there would be no surface. In 
getting an idea of surface, however, I am thinking of the 
boundary itself, not of that which is bounded. But the 
edge of the blackboard is also a boundary. It is a line. 
It, too, has no thickness, nor as a boundary has it any 
breadth. It has length without thickness or breadth. If 
it be a straight line (from the carpenter’s standpoint) it 
runs smoothly and evenly. Movement along it is only 
possible in two opposite directions and in one dimension. 
I may draw a straight “line” in ink on white paper. 
But such a line has breadth. Still the boundary between 
the black mark and the adjoining part of the white surface 
is a line for ideal construction. Now let two such lines 
be drawn so that they intersect. Where the boundary 
of one ink “line” cuts the boundary of the other ink 
“line” is the point of intersection. It has no parts and 
no magnitude. It is simply a position. It has no 
dimensions, and there is no possible movement therein. 
The full-stop at the end of this sentence is not a point. 
There would be plenty of room for a microscopic organism 
to move about in the space it occupies. But the position 
of its ideal centre would be a geometrical point. 
For the ideal construction of systematic thought the 
“room to move about in” of practical experience has three 
dimensions. A limitation of such space to two dimensions 
gives us the idea of a plane surface; a further limitation 
to one dimension, to that of a line; a yet further limita- 
tion to mere position, to that of a point. If we grasp the 
significance of the term “ point,” we shall see that the ex- 
pression “movement within a point” is nonsense. But 
the expression “movement of a point” is not nonsense. 
Combine the ideas suggested by “movement of a point
-P-A-G-E-156
  142 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
in one direction”: you reach the concept straight line. It 
is absolutely and ideally straight. Further, combine the 
ideas suggested by “ movement of a straight line at right 
angles to its length in the second dimension ”: you reach 
the concept plane superficies. It is absolutely and ideally 
plane. Once more combine the ideas suggested by “ move- 
ment of a plane superficies along another straight line at 
right angles to it”: you reach the concept of cubical space 
in three dimensions. Regarded as analytical stages in the 
limitation of our thought, the plane and the line might be 
spoken of as ideas; regarded as synthetic stages in the 
expansion of our thought, as concepts. But since they 
may be either or both, it is clear that the distinction 
cannot be very consistently preserved. Hence it was said 
a few pages back that the idea and the concept are very 
closely related. 
In exact thought we further combine the concepts of 
number and quantity with those of space. We may say, 
for example, that a point moves along a straight line 
through a space of five inches. Here we have a count 
in inches as units. Now suppose that a straight line five 
inches long moves at right angles to itself through five 
inches. The area traced out has five counts of the length 
of the line which was also five counts. But counts of 
counts is reached by multiplication. Hence to obtain the 
area we must multiply five by five. When the counts are 
the same the number is squared 5. If the plane surface 
of 25 square inches moves at right angles to its plane 
through 5 inches, a cubical space is traced out. We have 
counts of counts of counts. The number 5 has to be 
cubed, and in the space, thus ideally constructed there 
are 5 X 5 X 5, or 5% cubic inches. 
Since spatial relationships are peculiarly susceptible of 
exact measurement, space-units are much used in science
-P-A-G-E-157
SYSTEMATIC KNOWLEDGE 143 
as independent values of other magnitudes. All our exact 
measurements of time are reached indirectly through 
space measurements—the space traversed by the sun or 
the stars, by the hands of a clock, by the shadow in a 
sun-dial; in King Alfred’s days, the space by which the 
length of a burning candle was diminished. Any magni- 
tude may be represented by a spatial magnitude. Thus 
we reach the graphic method of presenting the results of 
all sorts of exact measurement, of which an example will 
be given in the eighth chapter (p. 224). 
In geometry a special mode of measurement is adopted 
as an ideal construction. Instead of imagining a line 
moving at right angles to itself, let the position of one of 
its boundary points be fixed, while the whole line swings 
round this point. The other boundary point will trace out 
a course termed a circle. One 360th part of a complete 
revolution is termed a degree; and the degree is an angular 
measurement. Thus the line may swing through 10°, 20°, 
30°, and so forth. The inclination of two lines to each 
other under these conditions is an angle. An inclination 
of 90° is aright angle. These familiar facts are mentioned 
to show that angular measurement is a special mode of 
ideal construction, which has advantages under special 
circumstances. It is employed, for example, in defining 
accurately the position of places on the earth’s surface. 
Our notions with regard to the shape and size of the 
earth are the outcome of systematic knowledge. We are 
apt to take over these notions on hearsay, and thus to pass 
them on to our pupils. But they only become part of 
our systematic knowledge or that of our pupils in so far 
as we adequately grasp the nature of the ideal construc- 
tions involved. That the surface of the earth, irrespective 
of the irregularities of mountains and valleys, the smooth 
surface of the ocean, for example, is not a flat plane, is  
-P-A-G-E-158
  144 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
shown by the well-known fact that when ships sail away 
from any point on the open sea, first their hulls, and then 
their lower sails and yard-arms disappear from view. This 
is in accordance with an ideal construction of a curved or 
arched surface; and the fact that the amount of disappear- 
ance is the same in all directions is in accordance with our 
knowledge of convex surfaces of equal curvature. The 
amount of that curvature has been accurately measured, 
for example, along the surface of a canal near Bedford. 
But a surface of equal convex curvature in all directions 
is in accordance with one, and only one, ideal construction 
—that of a sphere—the value or amount of curvature 
affording a means of determining the size of the sphere. 
Now it is one of the properties of the sphere—it is in- 
volved in the ideal construction—that the radii are all of 
equal length. And it is another property that if any two 
radii are inclined at an angle of say 1°, the distance be- 
tween the points at which they intersect the surface, 
measured along that surface, is constant in value. The 
arcs subtending an angle of 1° are all equal—but it has 
been found that the length of a degree varies at different 
parts of the earth’s surface. It is longer near the poles 
than it is near the equator. The ideal construction of a 
sphere will not accurately fit the facts disclosed by exact 
measurements along large stretches of the earth’s surface. 
That surface is one of varying curvature. It is flatter 
near the poles than it is near the equator. The ideal con- 
struction, termed an oblate spheroid, more nearly fits the 
facts. Furthermore, the length of any radius can be 
deduced from the rate at which a pendulum swings. This 
involves a physical ideal construction involved in the law 
of gravitation. Note that it is a case of measurement in 
terms of independent value. And note that it implies a 
synthesis of the concepts of physics with those of geometry.
-P-A-G-E-159
  SYSTEMATIC KNOWLEDGE 145 
Details are unnecessary. It suffices to say that the meas- 
urements of earth radii show that our globe is not a 
sphere, and not an oblate spheroid, though it pretty nearly 
approximates to the latter figure. 
It should be remembered that these probably familiar 
facts are adduced in illustration of the process of ideal 
construction and its relation to the facts of observation. 
Certain observations suggest the spherical form as appli- 
cable to the earth’s surface. But further observations 
show that this ideal construction will not square with 
all the facts. The construction has to be modified so as 
to embrace these outstanding facts, and we reach the oblate 
spheroid. But yet further observations disclose other 
discrepancies, and the ideal construction has again to be 
modified. And so on. In the earlier systems of astronom- 
ical knowledge the construction accepted was one in which 
the earth was the centre of the solar system, and the sun, 
moon, and planets revolved round it in circles. But the 
movements were’ found to be not circular. The construc- 
tion would not fit the facts, and had to be modified. Each 
member of the solar system was made, in the amended 
scheme, to revolve in a circle around a centre, which itself 
revolved in a circle around the earth as a centre. Thus 
arose the doctrine of cycles and epicycles. By repeated 
reconstructions on similar lines this interpretation became 
hopelessly complicated. A new ideal construction had to 
be tried with the sun, and not the earth as the centre. 
This in turn has undergone many modifications, leading 
up to the existing ideal construction of astronomy. 
To return to the determination of the position of places 
on the earth’s surface, there are two reasons why angular 
measurements are adopted; first, they enable us to neglect 
the different curvature of the surface in different regions ; 
secondly, they enable us to use the fixed stars for the 
 
-P-A-G-E-160
146 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
measurements of angular values. The size of the earth 
is so small in comparison with the enormous distances of 
these stars, that the angle made by a straight line drawn 
from any place on the earth’s surface, say to the pole-star, 
with the straight line from the centre of the earth to that 
star, is so minute as to be negligible. Now what is meant 
by saying that the geographical position of Tintagel is 50° 
40’ N. latitude and 4° 45’ W. longitude? That it lies in 
this N. latitude signifies that a radius of the earth which 
cuts the equator makes with the radius that cuts the 
earth’s surface at Tintagel an angle of 50° 40’, and that it 
lies in the northern hemisphere. There are, however, cer- 
tain conditions which must be fulfilled as part of the ideal 
construction. The point on the equator, Tintagel, and the 
earth’s centre must lie in a plane perpendicular to that of 
the equator. How can the latitude be ascertained? The 
plumb-line points to the centre of the earth in the direction 
of a radius; continued outwards into the heavens, it in- 
dicates a point among the stars. If a telescope at Tintagel 
be directed to that point, and then turned on its axis so 
as to be directed to the pole-star, it will rotate through an 
angle of 39° 20’. But the equatorial radius makes, with 
the polar radius, an angle of 90°. Hence if the angular 
value of the inclination of the polar and Tintagel radii be 
subtracted from 90° the latitude of the place is obtained. 
All the necessary observations can be made at Tintagel ; 
but they have reference to a world-wide ideal construction. 
We are all familiar with the lines of longitude drawn on 
the map. That of Greenwich passes through all places 
north and south of Greenwich to the poles. All these 
places lie in one plane. From this plane we in England 
reckon longitudes E. and W. up to 180°. That which 
contains Tintagel lies at an angle 4° 45’ W. of the plane 
of the Greenwich longitude. By what observations can
-P-A-G-E-161
  
  SYSTEMATIC KNOWLEDGE 147 
the longitude of Tintagel be determined? Here again we 
have a case of measurement in terms of independent value. 
It is noon at any place when the sun reaches its highest 
point in the heavens for the day in question. It takes the 
sun twenty-four hours to perform its apparent course, 
which is a measure of 360° in angular value. We know 
that this signifies one complete rotation of the earth on its 
axis; and our number-scheme enables us to find that rota- 
tion through 1° takes four minutes of time. But noon at 
Tintagel is later than noon at Greenwich; and the time- 
difference gives a measure of the longitude. The time 
of noon at Tintagel can be ascertained by observing the 
exact moment when the sun is highest in the heavens, 
and this can be compared with the time of noon at Green- 
wich. It is found that noon at Tintagel is nineteen 
minutes later than noon at Greenwich; and the angular 
value of nineteen minutes is 4° 45’, which is therefore the 
longitude of the place. 
Such is the ideal construction of special relations which 
are employed in defining geographical position. It is sur- 
prising how many people use the terminology without an 
adequate grasp of its significance. This is, however, by no 
means an isolated case in which we use concepts without 
the full realisation of the analysis and synthesis through 
which they have been reached. We all do it scores of 
times every day. The point that I have desired to render 
clear is that every concept and all systematic knowledge 
may be shown to have arisen through processes of com- 
parison, of analysis and synthesis, of abstraction and/ 
generalisation. That we usually do not, and often cannot, 
render the steps of the process explicit, merely shows how 
much of the common stock of thought we habitually take 
for granted. It is the office of the teacher to minister to 
the development of systematic knowledge in the minds of 
 
-P-A-G-E-162
  148 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
his pupils; and he should not be ignorant of the nature 
of the processes by which ideal constructions take form 
and shape, and the manner in which they are applied to 
particular and concrete cases, so as to shed upon them the 
light of thought. If he grasp the psychological principles 
underlying ideational and conceptual procedure, he will 
be in position to apply them in the discharge of his duties 
in any field of systematic knowledge. How best to apply 
them will afford full scope for all his tact and judgment. 
There are certain familiar maxims of method which are 
commonly accepted as guides to educational procedure. 
That we should proceed from the concrete to the abstract, 
is clearly in line with the psychological course of develop- 
ment from perceptual experience to systematic knowledge. 
It indicates that there must be adequate preparation and 
presentation, through which the pupil may be led on to 
generalisation. But we must not forget that there should 
also be application, and that the. value of abstract knowl- 
edge is to enable us and our pupils to interpret concrete 
phenomena; so that we should proceed from the concrete 
to the abstract in order to come back to the concrete with 
improved mental vision. Again, we are bidden to proceed 
from the indefinite to the definite. This procedure has, 
I trust, been sufficiently illustrated above. We start with 
a more or less indefinite whole of practical experience, and 
by analysis and synthesis reach definite conceptions of the 
same whole within the-sphere of thought. But when we 
have reached exact knowledge we are constantly applying 
it so as to render definite that which is still indefinite. 
We are in a sense reversing the procedure. In other 
words, we are now adopting that third maxim, which 
bids us proceed from the known to the unknown. Indeed, 
taken separately, these two maxims are seemingly anti- 
thetical. For the indefinite is the relatively unknown,  
-P-A-G-E-163
SYSTEMATIC KNOWLEDGE 149 
and the definite, to which we pass, the known. It would 
be absurd to say that our course should be from knowledge 
to ignorance. The fact is that these two maxims must be 
taken as complementary to each other. We are further 
bidden to proceed from the simple to the complex. The 
meaning of the maxim is sufficiently clear, and its validity, 
properly ‘interpreted, is evident. But we must bear in 
mind that ideal constructions have for their purpose the 
simplification of our thought concerning complex and 
multifarious phenomena, and that in grasping the unity 
which underlies the multiplicity of diverse phenomena, we 
are passing from the complex to the simple. On entering 
upon the study of any new subject we are weighed down 
by a sense of its complexity; as we proceed we are in due 
course gladdened by a sense of the simplicity of its essential 
framework. Each of the above maxims, then, may be 
justified on psychological grounds; but each must be 
accepted and applied with a dose of judgment. 
We have seen that in passing from naive perceptual 
experience to the ideal constructions of systematic knowl- 
edge, the processes of abstraction, generalisation, and in- 
ference reach intellectual maturity. It must be remem- 
bered, however, that each process has its germs in 
unanalysed experience. A centre of interest for percep- 
tual life—that to which attention is spontaneously drawn 
—is the precursor of the more highly developed abstract 
idea. It is that which matters for perception. Again, to 
behave in a similar manner to objects of like character 
serves to differentiate these objects as a group, within 
which the salient qualities stand out for the guidance of 
action. And this is the germ out of which the more 
explicit process of generalisation arises. All meaning 
implies generic meaning. Furthermore, things which have 
acquired meaning beget expectation, which is the pre-  
-P-A-G-E-164
150 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
cursor of logical inference. Many of the inferences, as we 
commonly term them, of daily life are confident expecta- 
tions resulting from repeated experiences under similar 
circumstances. Whether they should, in strictness, be 
termed inferences is a question of definition into which 
we need not enter. There is continuity in mental develop- 
ment. If in our thought we lay the chief stress on this 
continuity, we shall, to that end, apply, as do some authors, 
the same terms—abstraction, generalisation, inference— 
to both the perceptual and ideational stages within the 
curve of a continuous development. But if in our thought 
we lay the main emphasis on the differentiated stages, we 
shall for that purpose reserve, as other authors do, these 
terms for the processes as they occur at the higher level 
of systematic knowledge and ideal construction.
-P-A-G-E-165
CHAPTER VI 
THE FIELD OF INTERCOURSE—IMITATION AND SELF- 
ASSERTION 
IncIDENTALLY, but perhaps only incidentally, it must have 
become evident that ideal constructions are social products 
—that they imply a field of human intercourse within 
which they are developed. Let us try and render explicit 
some of the characteristic features of this important 
factor in mental development. Just as knowing, feeling, 
and doing are, in the closest possible manner, inter-related 
in personal experience, so are they related in many and 
varied ways to the experience of others. This is evident 
even at the outset of child-life. But with the growth 
and extension of systematic knowledge there comes a 
fuller realisation, reached by parallel and connected steps, 
of the self, of other selves, and of the world in which they 
live and which they endeavour to interpret. In history 
and literature and the humanities, the interaction of 
persons, under the guidance of purpose, is in the fore- 
ground of attention. But even in the scientific disciplines 
the personal and social reference is present. The boy who 
is learning chemistry in the laboratory is gaining know- 
ledge of the ways in which substances react on each 
other, but he is also becoming better acquainted with his 
own powers of manipulation and understanding, or their 
limitations; and he is realising what other boys and his 
151
-P-A-G-E-166
  152 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
master can do and know. And if some of the salient 
historical facts with regard to the course of discovery 
are skilfully introduced, his social outlook is quickened. 
Not only Mr. Brown, but Lavoisiér, Cavendish, and Dalton 
are his masters. In biology he is learning from Cuvier 
and Darwin. Hutton and Lyell speak to him of geological 
changes. The ideal constructions of astronomy have not 
only reference to planets and stars, but to Galileo, Kepler, 
and Newton, and to a self which is richer and stronger 
through its knowledge of astronomical science and its 
communion with the thoughts of great men. 
In a sense every one of us is strictly confined within 
the relatively narrow limits of his own experience and 
knowledge. These limitations are, however, not only 
intolerable in themselves; but we gaily disregard them 
throughout the whole field of intercourse; and that just 
because we are social beings. When an event happens, 
how it strikes us or how it affects us individually is not 
the only question; there is the further question, How it 
strikes or would affect others. This is always present in 
so far as we take up the social attitude. No doubt we 
have to interpret the experience of others in terms of our 
own; but this implies the conviction that they have 
their own experience which we may so interpret. When 
we are in a very sophisticated mood we may perhaps say 
that what we have in mind can only at best be the 
manner in which we conceive that others are affected. 
But normally and naturally we regard others as persons 
in their own right, and not only under the sufferance of 
our modes of conception. And we all do it. It seems 
to be one of the conditions under which the game of life 
is played. This is because we accept as an ideal con- 
struction a field of intercourse of which distinct persons 
are constituent members.
-P-A-G-E-167
   THE FIELD OF INTERCOURSE 153 
The steps by which this ideal construction was reached, 
and those by which this constant reference to the thoughts 
and feelings of others grew up, are not easy to trace. 
The whole problem of the perceptual origin of a basis in 
experience for the later conception of self, of not-self, 
and of other-self, involves difficult questions which cannot 
here be discussed at any length. The child’s feelings of 
satisfaction or the reverse, his restlessness or quiescence, 
his emotional stirrings in anger or fear, the aches and 
pains which he carries about with him through diverse 
situations—all these form a nucleus of self-reference. 
The child does not trouble his little head about subject 
and object; he just feels his own body tingling in a very 
characteristic and quite unmistakable way. From this 
there is developed at a later stage a notion of an embodied 
self—the happenings of the little world within his skin 
being his in a sense that other happenings are not. Yet 
later, by further abstraction, arises the more subtle ideal 
construction of a subjective Ego somehow associated with 
that part of the not-self which is called the body. But 
much of the experience of the little child is gained 
through impressions of sight, touch, hearing, and so forth, 
and all this is referred to objects around him towards 
which he has to behave in varied and appropriate ways; 
and ere long he distinguishes two groups, one comprising 
those objects which are comparatively inert, like tables 
and chairs, sticks and stones; the other containing objects 
which behave towards him in ways like those in which 
he behaves towards them—such as mother and nurse, for 
example, brothers and sisters, and (with a difference) dogs 
and kittens. The distinction is somewhat hazy to begin 
with, but it gradually becomes more clear. When we 
remember to how large an extent behaviour contributes 
to the development of all forms of perception, we can
-P-A-G-E-168
154 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
well understand how the different behaviour in presence 
of these two groups contributes to the perception of the 
radical distinction between animate and inanimate objects. 
And we must assume, if we are unable to prove, that the 
child projects into mother and nurse, brothers and sisters, 
other-selves analogous to himself. Only at a later stage, 
however, will this dim awareness of community of nature 
be supported by a reasoned inference that since others 
act as he acts they probably feel as he feels. The 
difficulty is to put into words the early perceptual phase 
of dim awareness, since words such as those used above, 
“community of nature,” stand for definite concepts, which 
have not yet taken anything like form or consistency. 
We need not enter further into the genetic problem. 
It suffices for us to remember that there are good grounds 
for believing that every step towards the realisation of the 
conception of self is also a step in the realisation of other- 
selves, and conversely, every step towards the better under- 
standing of others contributes to further self-knowledge. 
There can be little question that, apart from the use of 
Janguage, the functions of which we shall have to consider 
in the next chapter, one of the chief avenues leading up 
to the development of social relations, and the special 
modes of experience to which they give rise, is imitation. 
There is also, as we shall see, the impulse to opposition 
and self-assertion; but it will be well to consider imitation 
first. Through imitation the child enters into and 
assimilates the traditions of the race—those ways of 
behaving which are handed down irrespective of heredity. 
The child is born into a community of which the members 
are doing a number of things in a variety of ways—in the 
nursery or schoolroom, for example. Insensibly he catches 
up from others their modes of behaviour, and thus becomes 
a participator in the social life within the field of inter-   
-P-A-G-E-169
      THE FIELD OF INTERCOURSE 155 
course. Nor is this subtle contagion restricted to child- 
hood. In fashion and manners and morals we are all sub- 
consciously influenced by the example of others. All this 
arises out of an inborn tendency to behave as we see others 
behaving. It is the outcome of a special form of racial 
preparation. Children often ery or laugh or act in other 
ways for no other reason than that they see or hear others 
doing so. They behave instinctively. They do not mean 
to imitate. They just do so because that is the way they 
are made. There is no imitative intention. It is said 
that a wag, strolling into a meat-market on a warm day 
during a slack time, tried the experiment of a portentous 
yawn. In afew moments all the bored butchers’-assistants 
were yawning as if impelled to do so by some stern 
necessity. They didn’t intend to yawn: there was no 
imitative purpose. Under the conditions of boredom, if 
they saw someone yawning they must e’en yawn too. 
The behaviour of the wag just gave the requisite suggestion 
serving to call forth the similar behaviour, which, since it 
is similar, we term imitative. There is no deliberation, no 
exercise of volition; the response is automatic, and rises 
little above the level of a physiological response to the 
stimulus, 
The records of hypnotism are full of cases of slavish 
imitation under conditions in which deliberation seems to 
be wholly absent and the volitional nature appears to be 
lulled to sleep. For in this strange abnormal state the 
exercise of the personal will seems to be in abeyance. 
One of the characteristic features with regard to the 
whole range of observed mesmeric phenomena is the 
lack of initiative. Presumably there is no imitative 
intent; the “subject” is a living automaton. And yet 
one may see a hypnotic patient follow in every detail 
the acts of the controlling mesmerist—rub the back of   
-P-A-G-E-170
   
  156 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
his head, pass his hand across his eyes, unbutton his 
waistcoat, fling his handkerchief upon the floor, and so 
forth; being seemingly reduced to the level of a mere 
imitative machine. Of course all this falls under the head 
of “suggestion”; but where, as in such cases, the 
suggestion afforded by a given mode of procedure produces 
behaviour of like nature, the procedure is obviously in 
line with the phenomena of imitation, which under the 
hypnotic influence seems to be wholly subconscious and 
devoid of guiding purpose. Such, also, is some of the 
imitation of children. “Going out with the child F.,” 
says Professor Tracy, “I observed that she did almost 
everything I did; I brushed some dust from my coat, 
and she immediately brushed her dress in like manner. 
It is, in fact,” he adds, “ difficult fully to realise how the 
child is watching our every movement, and learning 
thereby. Not only parents and teachers, but every one 
who comes in contact with the child, even casually and 
occasionally, contributes his share, whether he will or 
not, to the child’s education. The moral of this is too 
obvious to require repetition.” 
So far we have had chiefly in view the hereditary basis 
of imitative procedure. Observers are in substantial 
agreement that it is first seen in children during the 
latter half of the first year—say from about seven 
months onwards. At about the close of the first year 
it assumes a position of much importance for the further- 
ance of mental development. For though it is instinctive 
in its nature and dependent upon a specific mode of 
racial preparation—being characterised by the fact that 
the presentation and the behaviour-application are of 
like nature, still its psychological value (as in the case 
of all instinctive procedure) is that it affords to the 
individual new modes of experience. It leads the child     
  
-P-A-G-E-171
  THE FIELD OF INTERCOURSE 157 
to take up into the field of his own behaviour the 
traditional behaviour of his companions, and thus to 
learn what it feels like to act as they are acting. It leads 
to sympathy. It is thus a social factor of great value, 
and has a potent educative influence in raising the 
procedure of the younger up to the level of the somewhat 
older and more developed. It widens and enriches 
experience by introducing the imitative child into new 
situations, and thus revealing meaning which would other- 
wise have remained undiscovered. An extravagant ex- 
ample is sometimes helpful. The following illustration 
may seem both extravagant and trivial, but may serve 
as a parable. A well-brought-up little boy in irreproach- 
able velveteen suit has, under suitable guidance, passed 
puddles in the road a hundred times. He goes out one 
day with a harum-scarum urchin, who tramps through 
them and becomes pleasantly dirty: he follows this new 
lead, and enters a field of experience, the thrilling and 
delightful meaning of which would, under less happy 
circumstances, have never been opened up to him. 
Henceforward he can sympathise, as he could not before, 
with those who are forbidden to mess in puddles. 
We may perhaps regard this as an unsatisfactory 
enlargement of the boy’s experience. But imitation is no 
respecter of persons or practices. It is more probable that 
it will lead him into the pranks and reprehensibilities 
common to boy life, than into the prim ways of maiden 
aunts. As we watch boys or girls in their natural life 
we constantly observe that someone in the field of inter- 
course becomes the central model for imitative be- 
haviour. Why this one and not another should be the 
one to set the tune to which he dances, he probably 
could not say. Presumably it is an inherited or acquired 
consonance of nature. In the poultry-yard the chicken 
 
-P-A-G-E-172
158 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
falls into the ways of other chicks, and often follows 
some particularly active and vigorous young bird, but 
ignores those of ducklings, just because he is a chick 
and not a duckling. The mischievous child follows every 
possible lead into mischief, the lazy into indolence, the 
vigorous into all active exercise. For each there are 
certain centres of influence which appeal to this or that 
trend of the imitative impulse. And this affords to the 
teacher a helpful insight into the nature and character 
of the child. 
It is unnecessary to say more on this head. I may 
repeat, however, that it is scarcely possible to over-estimate 
the importance of imitation as a means of bringing the 
child’s social behaviour into line with that of his class- 
mates and those who are his fellows and companions in 
a common field of intercourse. By doing what they do, 
he learns what it feels like so to act. He realises his 
own powers and limitations; and he realises, too, the 
powers and limitations of others. He gains a sense of 
the value of social co-operation. As he imitates the 
procedure of others in dealing with the things around 
him, the objects become centres of a common and social 
reference. They are not only objects within his own 
experience, but they are objects within the experience of 
his companions. As he regards them, so in like manner 
do others regard them. The world around him is not 
only his world, but their world also: And as he imitates 
their ways of dealing with the world he makes it more 
his own, fuller of meaning for his private and personal 
experience; and, at the same time, he sees how full of 
meaning it is, too, for them and for others. 
When once the child is through imitation initiated 
into any situation, the operation of the perceptual process 
determines his further behaviour. Pleasant situations
-P-A-G-E-173
  THE FIELD OF INTERCOURSE 159 
are again sought; unpleasant situations are avoided. All 
this is in line with the whole development of practical 
experience. But there seems to be a special and peculiar 
satisfaction which, in some cases, attaches to the imi- 
tative process as such. Thus the child seeing and hearing 
someone produce a sound, for example a musical note or 
a simple word, imitates at first imperfectly, then with 
better results, and perhaps goes on repeating the sound, 
often with wearisome reiteration, apparently for the 
pleasure experienced in the mere consonance of the sound 
with the model and with those already produced. So, 
too, other imitative actions may be ofttimes repeated, just 
to get them better in accord with those which suggest 
their performance. But here we have the tendency, 
so strong throughout the development of practical ex- 
perience, to fix the attention rather on the product than 
the process. It is the sound produced, that is to say 
the result of activity, rather than the means by which 
it is produced, that is in the focus of consciousness. 
We have two words, “copy” and “imitate”; and 
commonly they are used interchangeably. Thus in the 
language of proverb we say that monkeys copy their mas- 
ters, and that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. 
But it might be well to differentiate their use; and to 
employ the term “copy” when we reproduce a product, 
and the term “imitate” when we are guided by the 
manner in which it is produced. Thus we copy a pic- 
ture, but we imitate the handling of the pencil or brush, 
and the way in which certain effects are attained. 
We imitate the potter’s procedure; but we afterwards 
copy the vases he has made. Since this usage is, how- 
ever, not established, we may take copying as the form 
of imitation towards which practical experience has 
a tendency to pass. In demonstration as an aid to
-P-A-G-E-174
  160 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
the acquirement of skill we show the means—not, 
indeed, the inner means of physiological co-ordination, 
but the visible means as expressed in active behaviour, 
—by which the skilled act may be reached. Even here, 
however, imitation of the manner of doing is only a 
transient stage; the attention is soon transferred to the 
thing to be done, rather than on the manner of doing it. 
Generally classed under imitation is the copying of 
outlines or drawings. Professor Mark Baldwin describes 
some interesting experiments with his daughter, in which 
such procedure was made the subject of investigation. 
Selecting a few objects well differentiated in outline,— 
animals which she had already learned to recognise and 
name after a fashion,—he drew them one by one on 
paper, and let her imitate the “copy.” The observations 
extended from the last week of her nineteenth month 
to the middle of the twenty-seventh month. The results 
show that, with this child, up to the beginning of the - 
twenty-seventh month there was no connection apparent 
between “a mental picture in consciousness” and the 
movements made by the hands and fingers in attempting 
to draw it. The “drawing” was simply the vaguest and 
most general imitation of the teacher’s movements, not 
the tracing of “a mental picture.” There is: practically 
no resemblance in the examples he gives between the 
indefinite, at first angular (but later on more curved) 
lines, and the object set before the child as a copy. 
But early in the twenty-seventh month a change came. 
Professor Baldwin drew a rough human figure, naming 
the parts in succession as they were made: his daughter 
suddenly seemed to catch the idea of tracing each part, 
and she now for the first time began to follow the order she 
saw her father take: “head” (circle) at the top; “ body ” 
(ellipse) below; “legs” (two straight lines) farther 
   
-P-A-G-E-175
THE FIELD OF INTERCOURSE 161 
down; “arms” (two lines) at the sides of the body. It 
was all done in the crudest fashion, as would be expected 
from the lack of muscular co-ordination. But the fact 
was unmistakable that with the simplification of the 
figure of breaking it up into parts had come also the idea 
of tracery imitation, and its imperfect execution. “By 
the ‘idea’ of tracery imitation, I mean,” says Professor 
Baldwin, “the sense of connection between what was 
visually in her own consciousness and the movement of 
her own hand or pencil. The visual pictures or copies 
had been there in all her previous trials, and so had the 
hand movements, both the sight of them and the muscular 
(kinesthetic) sensations; but there had been no sense 
of a connection between them, and agreement in the 
result when they were compared.” 
This is a point of considerable interest. It comes to 
this: that up to a certain stage there is no realisation 
of the fact that imitation may subserve an end or pur- 
pose, that of more or less accurately reproducing the copy ; 
and no comparison between the one and the other is 
instituted. Of interest, too, is the relative suddenness 
of the change from indefinite pencil-strokes made in 
imitation of her father’s procedure, to relatively definite 
lines drawn in orderly succession. It seems to mark the 
passage to systematic procedure; the dawn of ideational 
* process. And it looks like an early example of that in- 
sight which comes to us according to the adage in a flash. 
Presumably in many other ways the child was gaining 
ideational preparation; and this was almost suddenly 
applied in the copying. 
For a while the reproduction in Professor Mark Bald- 
win’s daughter was limited to two or three copies— 
objects which she saw him make. That it was now not 
merely imitation of his movements was evident from
-P-A-G-E-176
  162 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
the fact that she did not simply follow them; she looked 
intently upon the figure which he made, not at his move- 
ments in making it, and then strove to copy the figure 
with movements of her own, very different from his. 
But she only applied the method of procedure to par- 
ticular figures, for she could not trace at all an alto- 
gether new figure in eight lines. Further, she traced 
these particular figures just as well without the copies 
before her. Here, therefore, is the rise of tracery imita- 
tion of the child’s own mental picture—a fact of great 
theoretical interest. The child had risen from indefinite 
imitation of the action of her father in using the pencil 
without reproduction of the figure, to the attainment of 
such reproduction through imitation of the sequence of 
his movements, and from this to the reproduction of a 
mental image retained in memory. 
When the ideational and conceptual type of mental 
process has been established in the course of mental de- 
velopment, imitation is utilised for, and made subservient 
to, the purposes of the intellectual, moral, or zsthetic life. 
If a boy in the cricket-field tries to mould his batting in 
accordance with that of the captain of the eleven, his aim 
is, through imitation, to become a good cricketer. This 
is the means he adopts to attain a worthy ideal. Imitation 
thus contributes to some of the highest and most complex 
forms of human endeavour. Of this I shall have some- , 
thing more to say (p. 167). J 
An illustration from the use of language may serve to 
indicate the stages of imitative process. It is -probable 
that the production of sounds, some of them incipiently 
articulate, is instinctive in the human infant; and when 
the sound made by another human being is the stimulus to 
the production of like sounds we have instinctive imita- 
tion. This is the first stage. The second stage is
-P-A-G-E-177
THE FIELD OF INTERCOURSE 163 
perceptual. Satisfaction derived from consonance leads 
to frequent repetition with improved consonance, through 
the elimination of those factors in the response which 
lead to failure. But, apart from this, the sounds are per- 
ceived to carry meaning, and to be a means of develop- 
ing certain situations in the field of intercourse. Here 
we have the beginning of inter-communication with others. 
Improvement in the use of language follows. Thus we 
gradually pass to the third or ideational stage, where 
imitation is subservient to the purposes of the intel- 
lectual and esthetic life. An ideal of accurate and 
correct speech, with well-modulated and rhythmic se- 
quence and music, takes shape in the mind and forms a 
model of style. We are constantly on the look-out for 
excellencies of diction. We frame an ideal of effective 
speaking or writing, and utilise the imitative process in 
our endeavours towards its attainment. 
It is clear that the careful observation and critical 
discussion of the phenomena of imitation opens up a 
wide and fascinating field in the domain of child-study. 
What are the conditions of its first occurrence? What 
is its rate of growth? Of what nature are the steps 
towards more and more accurate imitation? Is the 
method that of trial and error, with selection of the hits 
and elimination of the misses, as the imitative behaviour 
is repeatedly performed? What are the differences among 
children as to persistency of imitative effort? Some 
children seem satisfied with poor results; others are not 
content until the imitation is relatively perfect. What 
is the relation between imitation and attention? In 
fostering the former are we not training the child in the 
application of the latter? May we say that the more 
concentrated and well-directed the attention the more 
accurate and adequate is the imitation? Or does the 
accuracy lie deeper, and depend upon some innate bias in 
 
-P-A-G-E-178
  164 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
the constitution to be satisfied with nothing less than 
the best attainable by reiterated effort? May the strength 
and persistency of the imitative impulse be regarded as a 
gauge of the general mental level, a sign of firmness on 
the one hand or flabbiness on the other hand of mental 
fibre? How far is imitation in so social a creature as the 
child a necessary step to the later development of in- 
dividual initiative and originality? May we say here, 
as I think we may say in higher phases of mental life, 
that the faithful imitation of the best masters is the 
necessary precursor of independence of treatment at a 
worthy level of performance? These, and many other 
such questions, suggest themselves for consideration; as 
problems to be held in the background of our thought 
while we are making such detailed observations as oppor- 
tunity affords on the imitative behaviour even of little 
children. Every teacher should be a close observer of 
children. But if our child-study is to be fruitful, it must 
not only be minute, faithful, and accurate, but must be in 
touch with broad views as to its bearing on the great 
and important problem of the development of the human 
mind. 
Since imitation helps to bring-the-ehild-into line with | 
his companions, its tendency is towards social convergence. 
But not less important in the field of intercourse is a 
tendency towards divergence. In this tendency, in- 
dividualism, originality, initiative, competition, emulation, 
have their roots. We have no single word which will 
comprehensively cover the wide range of facts, implying 
more or less self-assertion, which lie open to our observa- 
tion in the life of children and adults. Opposition has 
been suggested, and may suffice. In their quite early days 
we see in young animals and children an impulse to 
have their own way, to get things from others, to outdo 
 
-P-A-G-E-179
  THE FIELD OF INTERCOURSE 165 
others, to monopolise for themselves objects and situations 
which are a source of satisfaction. Such inborn pro- 
clivities, while they contain the germs of selfishness, con- 
tain also the germs of sturdy independence, and contribute 
to success in life. They have their biological origin in the 
struggle for existence under the stress of which those in 
whom there was no such impulse to self-assertion in 
opposition to others, would stand but a slender chance of 
survival. This, too, helps the child as perceptual experi- 
ence widens, to realise his own powers and limitations 
always in close relation to the powers and limitations of 
others. He becomes masterful in this situation, or sub- 
servient in that, within the field of intercourse. He learns 
his own place; and this is one of the valuable lessons of 
school-life ; a lesson which the child, brought up apart from 
companions of about his own age, fails adequately to learn. 
Thus, as Professor Royce has said,’ “side by side with 
the social processes of the imitative type appear another 
group of reactions practically inseparable from the former, 
but in character decidedly contrasted with them. These 
phenomena of social opposition have an unquestionably 
instinctive basis. They appear very early in childhood. 
They last in most people throughout life. They may 
take extremely hostile and formidable shapes. In their 
normal expression they constitute one of the most valu- 
able features of any healthy social activity. This fact may 
be illustrated by any lively conversation or discussion. 
“As a rule, the acts that express this fondness for 
social contrast, and for opposing one’s self to the social 
environment, are, in their origin, secondary to the imita- 
tive acts. It is true that the instinctive basis for them 
appears quite as early as do the manifestations of the 
imitative instincts. And since this fondness for opposi- 
1 Outlines of Psychology, pp. 277-279. 
 
-P-A-G-E-180
  166 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
tion is in part based upon the elemental emotions of the 
type expressed in anger, obstinacy, and unwillingness to 
be interfered with, the instinctive basis for the type of 
action here in question may be said to be manifest even 
earlier in infancy than is the case with the imitative 
reactions. But while the instinctive basis of opposition 
is primitive, the social acts that can express such instincts 
must be acquired. And in order to contrast one’s self with 
one’s social environment, it is necessary, in general, first 
to learn how to do something that has social significance. 
I cannot oppose you by my speech unless I already know 
how to talk. I cannot rival you as a musician unless I 
already understand music. But speech and music have 
to be learned by imitation. Hence the social reactions 
which express the fondness for contrast and opposition 
must, on the whole, follow in their development the social 
reactions dependent on imitation. This accounts for 
that close weaving together of the two types of functions 
of which we have already spoken. The playful child 
already seizes whatever little arts he has acquired by 
imitation to express his wilfulness, or to develop his own 
devices, or to display himself to his environment. And on 
the other hand, a form of wilfulness or obstinacy, in an 
already highly intelligent being, may lead to a deliber- 
ately painstaking process of imitation, such as happens 
whenever an ambitious artist devotes himself long to 
training in order that thereby he may get the better of 
his rivals. In brief, the preservation of a happy balance 
between the imitative functions and those that emphasise 
social contrasts and oppositions, forms the basis for every 
higher type of mental activity. And the entire process 
of conscious education involves the deliberate appeal to 
the docility of these two types of social instincts. For 
whatever else we teach to a social being, we teach hinr to 
 
-P-A-G-E-181
   THE FIELD OF INTERCOURSE 167 
imitate. And whatever use we teach him to make of his 
social imitations in his relations with other men, we are 
obliged at the same time to teach him to assert himself in 
some sort of way in contrast with his fellows, and by 
virtue of the arts which he possesses.” 
Both imitation and self-assertion in opposition to others 
may reach a comparatively high level of development at 
the perceptual stage of practical experience. But when 
the child begins to analyse the situations of daily life, to 
extract from them abstract and general ideas, and to re- 
combine these ideational products in ideal constructions of 
self, of other selves, of the community, and of conduct as 
between selves within the community, imitation and self- 
assertion are caught up into the intellectual, moral, and 
volitional life. They lose somewhat of that naiveté, that 
spontaneous simplicity, and unaffected ingenuousness, 
which often lend a charm to the natural behaviour of the 
unsophisticated child. They are realised as factors in 
conduct contributing in due proportion to the moulding of 
life on a settled plan, with a definite purpose, in accord- 
ance with an ideal construction. They are regarded as 
means to a wider end, to be utilised amid the oppor- 
tunities which the concrete situations of daily life afford. 
The nature of ideal construction has already been con- 
sidered; through the analysis of experience we reach the 
abstract ideas which are synthetically rebuilt in general 
conceptions. But the value of these conceptions lies in 
their application to particular cases on which they shed 
the light of systematic knowledge. Here we are speci- 
ally concerned with general conceptions of conduct within 
the field of intercourse. Now we cannot imitate a general 
conception ; we cannot, indeed, be said to imitate anything 
which is abstract and schematic; for what we imitate is 
some concrete mode of behaving. But it is one of the
-P-A-G-E-182
168 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
functions of imagination to embody in concrete form the 
products of conceptual thought. We can imagine the 
actual conduct which is based upon abstract and general 
principles; and we can mould our own actions on those 
which we picture in imagination as performed by an ideal 
character under such circumstances as those in which we 
are placed. We can follow his example as we follow the 
example of a living person. And this is at any rate in 
line with imitative procedure. At the perceptual stage a 
boy imitates the behaviour of that schoolfellow who, with- 
out any explicit analysis of his actions, without any 
conscious reference to the underlying motives, is regarded 
as the hero; for, just in so far as there is analysis and 
reference to motives, the boy has passed beyond the per- 
ceptual stage. When he compares, abstracts, and selects ; 
when he combines this schoolfellow’s conduct in the class- 
room, that one’s prowess in the playground, and the home 
behaviour of a holiday friend, he is beginning to frame 
conceptions of an ideal hero whose modes of life are to 
be his model. Most of us, as rational beings, have thus 
selected traits of character from many friends and ac- 
quaintances, from persons in the realms of history and 
fiction, and have fused these by the synthesis of thought 
into our ideal man, whose conduct in any concrete situa- 
tion we more or less clearly and distinctly imagine. And 
this embodied product of the imagination, reached by 
ideational process, is our example of right living. Thus 
imitation may be contributory to life-conduct in con- 
formity with the ideal, and, as some of us believe, may 
reach its highest expression in the title of a book which 
has been found helpful to thousands, and among them 
not the least gifted of men and women—the Imitatio 
Christi. 
Of all ideal constructions, those which involve concep-
-P-A-G-E-183
  THE FIELD OF INTERCOURSE 169 
tions of character and conduct within the field of inter- 
course are, for social beings, among the most important. 
As the teacher must utilise mathematics, geometry, 
physical science, botany, and other such disciplines to 
enable the child to frame ideal constructions of the world 
in which he lives; so, too, must he utilise the whole range 
of the humanities to help his pupils to reach an ideal con- 
struction of the relationships of man to man within the 
field of human intercourse. His own ministry, as a 
teacher, must be founded on conceptions of educational 
procedure which he must apply in daily practice. He 
has to endeavour to bring into consistent harmony the 
imitative and the self-assertive impulses—those tending to 
bring the child into line with normal procedure, and those 
tending towards individuality and originality. Although 
both should be developed side by side, and although the 
impulse to originality should assuredly never be unduly. 
checked, it would seem that the most effective initiative 
arises from a basis of experience assimilated from the 
behaviour of others. In other words, on both the per- 
ceptual and the ideational planes of mental development 
it seems, in accordance with sound educational procedure, 
that imitation should be made the stepping-stone to 
originality. This fact seems to be somewhat overlooked. 
by some of the extreme advocates of the heuristic method 
of science-teaching. They wisely insist on the paramount 
importance of practical work and personal manipulation, 
that is to say, on the development of a sound and work- 
able body of directly correlated experience. Without 
this, they contend, mere didactic information is of little 
educational value. So far they are on firm psychological 
ground. But they sometimes unwisely insist too much on 
boys and girls being, at quite an early stage, left to them- 
selves that they may discover the meaning and signifi-
-P-A-G-E-184
170 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
cance of experimental work. They preach the doctrine 
that the mental attitude to be encouraged is that of 
original research. I question whether this mental atti- 
tude is to be reasonably expected at this stage of develop- 
ment. In any case, is not the best avenue to original 
research that which is opened up through the imitation 
of the researches of others? In training older students, 
the best method is to let them work through, and go over 
for themselves, some line of research prosecuted by an 
acknowledged master, not in ignorance of the end attained, 
with a view to rediscovery, but with this end always in 
full sight, that the steps of the master, also clearly seen 
beforehand, may be retraced, and that they may learn how 
to follow such a path. If we look to the life-record of 
the masters themselves in art, in letters, in science, do 
we not find that in their early days they were imitators, 
often slavish imitators, of the style and method of their 
masters? Before they became their original selves they 
were members of a school—the pre-Raphaelite School, 
the school of Lake Poetry, the school founded by Liebeg 
in his laboratory. They climbed up the ladder of imita- 
tion before they reached a height which allowed the free 
use of their wings of originality. No doubt, however, 
the teacher who possesses tact and judgment will be able 
so to arrange his course of work as to afford his pupils 
opportunities of coming into line with traditional modes 
of behaviour, moulding their methods on those of worthy 
examples without robbing them of the educational advan- 
tage of finding out things for themselves. Unquestion- 
ably they ought to be led to discover, and not merely to 
be informed about, the nature and properties of the sub- 
stances with which they are dealing. But it is through 
imitation that the child in early life learns so much about 
the world; and what we have to do in the laboratory is
-P-A-G-E-185
  THE FIELD OF INTERCOURSE 171 
to set the boy on the more or less beaten track, so that, 
by doing as others have done he may find out for himself 
what they have long ago discovered. His interest in his 
own personal discoveries is quickened by the sense that he 
is participating in the like interests of others. . 
Little has been said above on the characteristic affective 
tone which arises within the field of intercourse. Let 
us review some of the salient facts in this connection, 
remembering that what we term interest is a form or 
mode of affective tone. Quite early in the course of his 
development the child takes especial interest in the 
doings of others. He comes of a social race. He is 
ushered into a world in which mother, father, brothers, 
sisters, and other human folk play a quite peculiar part. 
The experience he gains of them differs from that which 
he gains of inanimate objects, and even his experience 
of inanimate objects is gained side by side with them, 
and has meaning and interest not for himself alone, but 
for his companions and associates in conjunction with 
him. The imitative tendency, as we have seen, gives 
ample opportunities for community of experience, and 
helps the child to enter into the heritage of traditional 
modes of procedure. He does things after others, and 
with others, and gradually realises that their experience 
is like his and his like theirs. He has his tussles with 
others, takes from them their favourite toys, has his own 
snatched from him by them. He wants what they want, 
and gets it himself or sees them get it. In a thousand 
ways he shares their life and feelings. In a thousand 
situations there is community of interest. And com- 
munity of interest as developed by intercourse is suffused 
with the affective tone of sympathy. 
From a slightly different point of view, we may say that 
sympathy is the affective tone accompanying gregarious
-P-A-G-E-186
172 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
behaviour. It is one of the instinctive tendencies of 
human beings to make common cause and unite with 
their fellows in the prosecution of similar ends. And 
the instinctive tendency is supported by all the practical 
teachings of intercourse. It is effective, when isolated 
action and effort fails: it leads to the completion of 
situations which would otherwise remain incomplete: it 
brings with it the satisfaction of corporate success, instead 
of the mortification of personal failure. And in that 
satisfaction there is social reinforcement which raises it 
above the individual level. Thus personal interests in 
the related experience are strengthened by sympathetic 
interests due to the added relationships of mutual en- 
deavour. Intercourse raises affective tone to a higher 
level. And if it be true that the spontaneous impulses of 
perceptual life lead the flow of consciousness towards the 
completion of the most pleasant situations, it must be 
remembered that for social beings half the pleasure of the 
situations begotten of intercourse is due to the incorpora- 
tion of sympathetic interest. 
In any group of boys and girls there is, too, a certain 
amount of internal regulation of interest and endeavour. 
In the play-situation divergencies from the common aim 
are visited with unpleasant consequences. If they are 
carried too far, the offending party is excluded from the 
field of intercourse, and becomes an outsider, out of touch 
with the social interests of his companions. And nothing 
can show more clearly the important part played by 
sympathetic interest in the development of affective tone, 
than the effect generally preduced by such exclusion from 
the field of play-intercourse. Or if there be anything 
which shows the force of sympathy with equal clearness, 
it is the heightened endeavour and added zest of those 
who win the admiration and glad support of their com-
-P-A-G-E-187
   THE FIELD OF INTERCOURSE 173 
panions, and become leaders in the situation and proud 
centres of the field of intercourse. 
If we turn from the narrower field of the play-situation 
to the broader field of the school at large the internal 
regulation within the groups of pupils is supplemented 
and extended by the external regulation emanating from 
the masters and mistresses. And if in their wider sphere 
of intercourse the teachers are differentiated from the 
taught, there must also be the integrating bonds of sym- 
pathetic interest. The teacher must not stand aloof 
in the proud isolation of his more advanced intellectual 
or moral system, proclaiming abstract principles ex 
cathedra, but must step down into the arena of the 
practical situations in which alone his pupils can at 
present move with ease and freedom. He will here find 
the body of practical experience, including that begotten 
of intercourse, which will afford abundant data from 
which he may select the materials on which to found the 
beginnings of a system of conduct, and by means of 
which he may lead up, by easy steps, from the sympathetic 
impulses which form part of the affective tone of percep- 
tual behaviour, to the motives on which truly moral and 
volitional acts are founded. For here, as elsewhere, he 
must constantly bear in mind what may be regarded as 
the cardinal maxim of educational development. Always 
proceed from concrete situations to abstract system, and 
never let abstract system outrun too far the practical 
situations on which it is its function to shed light. It 
is of little avail to preach the higher abstract morality, 
applicable to the more complex and difficult situations 
of adult life, when the simpler circumstances of school 
intercourse have scarcely risen above the lower level of 
perceptual treatment in the light of the sympathetic 
impulses of the passing moment. The wise teacher
-P-A-G-E-188
174 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
will find within the limits of school intercourse, the 
concrete embodiment in practical form of two leading 
principles which form the conceptual foundations of all 
moral endeavour, the ideal self and the ideal community. 
The situational embodiment of the ideal self is hero- 
worship: the ideal community is the school as it is, or as 
it can be made by its heroes and the lesser folk who look 
up to them for guidance. Schoolboy ethics and the 
schoolboy code of honour are sometimes quaint products 
of the beginnings of system. They lack refinement, they 
exhibit strange distortions, they have a touch of barbarism. 
But it is just here that the influence of the sympathetic 
teacher can make itself felt—not by running directly 
counter to the inherent tendencies of schoolboy situations, 
but by insensibly adding here a little and there a little 
to their refinement, by gently but firmly repressing the 
distortions, and by subtly introducing into the concrete 
situations of school life the elements of a higher civilisa- 
tion. A great change has come over our public schools 
within the last half-century. The masters mix more 
freely with the boys, enter more fully into their out-of- 
school life, and are in closer touch and increased sympathy 
with their development outside the walls of the classroom. 
And now it is more true than it was fifty years ago, that 
the tone or “ good form” of a school is a joint product of 
the sympathetic intercourse of teachers and taught. 
But apart from the practical situations of the daily life 
of the school as a social community, much of the class 
work has, as before mentioned, an important though in- 
cidental bearing on the development of a system of con- 
duct. And on this ground, if on no other, a due share in 
the curriculum must always be reserved for the humanities. 
The concrete situations portrayed in literature and history 
(and in the early stages of education they should be

  THE FIELD OF INTERCOURSE 175 
developed frankly as pictured situations, without as yet 
attempting to pry into their deeper significance )—these 
concrete dramatic episodes, what are they but repre- 
sentative extensions of the field of intercourse? Through 
them it is the business of the teacher to minister, quite 
as much to the affective development as to the cognitive 
development of the young. Of course here, as always, the 
affective tone is the accompaniment of cognitional assimila- 
tion. But the relational links of interest are suffused 
with sympathy. Fhe teacher must elicit the sympathies of 
his pupils with the actors in the literary or historical 
drama, and must subtly show the trend of his own sym- 
pathies for their guidance in right and wholesome direc- 
tions. And the pity of it is that for purposes of 
examination the affective aspect, which educationally is of 
such great importance, drops so much into the background. 
What has been assimilated as so much knowledge can be 
readily tested. The relational links to the body of repre- 
sentative experience, or the system of historic thought in 
their cognitive aspect, almost inevitably count for more 
than the worth and quality of the affective tone which 
suffuses them with sympathetic interest. And yet this is 
what gives to literary and historical studies in school life 
their chief educational value—a value which it is difficult 
to over-estimate. 
There is one more question to which, since it is im- 
plicated in affective development within the field of inter- 
course, some reference must here be made. What part 
should rewards and punishments take in that develop- 
ment? Ideally, sympathetic approbation should be the 
only and sufficient reward; disapprobation the sole and 
sufficient punishment. But, to take first the question of 
rewards, they may perhaps be regarded as practical and 
 
-P-A-G-E-190
  176 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
concrete embodiments of approbation. Still we must be 
careful, in that case, that they are regarded merely as such 
symbols of approbation, and not as ends in themselves. 
Parents who have so acted that their children are always 
looking for the reward, are likely to find their course beset 
with difficulties. Without the expected reward as an 
incentive the child will be pitiably inert, if not refractory. 
And in school life, for classwork well done (or perhaps 
more often for fortunate endowment) rewards in the form 
of prizes and the like are often regarded as necessary in- 
centives to the output of endeavour. They must, however, 
be looked upon as merely temporary expedients to supply 
an extraneous element of interest which may supplement 
that of winning knowledge and position. If the work of 
school life is only the beginning of, and the training for, 
the work of after life, there is at least some danger lest the 
studies prosecuted for the sake of a prize should be dis- 
continued when the days of prizes are past. And if it be 
said that the prize-winners are generally those who would 
have won the same position from intrinsic interest apart 
from extraneous inducement, is not this tantamount to 
saying that, after all, the prize-reward is unnecessary? On 
the other hand, prizes may perhaps be regarded as the con- 
crete symbols of approbation, and valued as such. Still, 
working for prizes is somewhat analogous to playing for 
money. And many of us in our hearts admire more the 
man who plays for the game, and the lad who works for 
the system of knowledge, than the man who plays for the 
stakes or the boy who strives for the prize—both, be it 
understood, under the sympathetic conditions of inter- 
course. To win is a worthy object of ambition—but not 
of necessity to win the stakes or the prize; rather to 
win knowledge and to gain sympathy and approbation. 
Turning now to the obverse side of the picture, I repeat 
 
-P-A-G-E-191
THE FIELD OF INTERCOURSE — 177 
that, ideally, disapprobation should be the sole and suf- 
ficient punishment. But the ideal system requires ideal 
material; and the raw material of human nature, as 
given in children, seldom meets the requirements of the 
teacher’s ideal. Hence disapprobation must often carry 
with it a sting which shall act as a deterrent to the com- 
pletion of situations which seem unsatisfactory to the 
parent or teacher, and which in a few years will seem 
equally unsatisfactory to the patient. Many of us, in 
looking back on our early days and on our relations with 
those set in authority over us, have cause to be profoundly 
grateful for some, at least, of the punishment which we 
then incurred. We now realise that without this bitter 
medicine our mental and moral health would not have 
been preserved. Personally, I have met many men and 
women who have expressed regret that punishment was 
not inflicted on them more often and more severely: I 
have encountered but few who could honestly say that 
they would have been the better without the share that 
fell to their lot. And in these few cases what has seemed 
most sorely to rankle has been the hard and unsym- 
pathetic attitude of one who inflicted punishment rather 
from love of it than from love of them. Into the delicate 
questions which must arise out of a discussion of the exact 
form or forms which punishment should take, I cannot 
attempt to enter. But as a guiding principle I would 
suggest the maxim: Never punish unless you are quite 
sure that you will deserve, if you do not get, the thanks 
of your pupils when they come to years of discretion.
-P-A-G-E-192
  CHAPTER VII 
LANGUAGE AND THOUGHT 
Tue most obvious function of language is to afford a means 
of intercommunication within the field of intercourse. 
It is clear, however, that such communication can only be 
an aid to, or the supplement of, the experience and know- 
ledge of the hearer. In other words, it must be received, 
subject to the psychological conditions of assimilation. 
It must always be in touch with the things with which it 
deals and with the thought which it serves to express. 
A second function of language, closely connected with 
the first, is that it forms a medium of record. This, of 
course, in its full development requires the use of written 
or printed characters. It thus indefinitely extends the 
field of intercourse and enables us to hold communion with 
those who are absent, to profit by the experience and 
knowledge of our predecessors, and to hand over to our. 
successors an enriched heritage of thought. Of that 
thought it is an expression; and as embodied in language 
thought is brought under control. This is so important 
that it may be regarded as a distinct function of language. 
Words are the concrete symbols of abstract and general 
ideas. As concrete they serve to hold and direct atten- 
tion; in their synthetic combination they constitute an 
art-product which can be moulded and fashioned at will. 
Through language thought can be manipulated. When 
178
-P-A-G-E-193
  LANGUAGE AND THOUGHT 179 
we remember that control is primarily and distinctively 
exercised over motor activities, and that all spoken and 
written language is an application of such activities, it is 
clear that when images and ideas are symbolised by words 
they are brought indirectly under a control to which they 
are not directly susceptible. Primarily developed for 
purposes of oral communication with others, language 
becomes also a personal possession of great value, as both 
the tool and the material by the use of which the pro- 
cesses and products of: individual thought can be rendered 
more shapely and systematic. Articulation may be 
suppressed to an inaudible whisper, and thus pass into 
an internal process, over which, however, we still retain 
full control as we think in words. And when the spoken 
word is recorded in written symbols, our powers of 
manipulation are increased. We can strike out re- 
dundant expressions, insert here, transpose there, recast 
in many ways, and mould our thought as we would mould 
a piece of plastic clay. Herein lies part of the educa- 
tional value of essay-writing. 
Furthermore, since language is a social product, through 
its use we more fully realise that our own experience and 
the experience of others are of a similar kind. Thus a 
conception of the unity of human thought, and a corre- 
sponding reference to a common universe of discourse is 
fostered. (Language helps to remove what philosophers 
have termed “the fundamental isolation of the individual 
mind,” and yet ends to render clear the individual 
identity of the speaker.) For the uttered word carries a 
treble reference: to the object of experience or thought 
to which it applies; to that which it implies to us 
individually; to that which we conceive it implies to 
another. Here, again, we have the concomitant develop- 
ment of notions of self, of other-self, and of world. Lastly,
-P-A-G-E-194
  
180 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
language (is an indispensable \ aid to the processes of 
analysis and synthesis, through which we attain to ideal 
constructions. As Dr. Stout,t who has done much to 
emphasise the psychological importance of this aspect of 
language, says: “Intercommunication of ideas implies 
analysis of the objects and processes presented to percep- 
tion into certain constituents which recur in varying com- 
binations in various particular cases. The use of language, 
therefore, involves the analysis of objects into common 
factors, and their free reconstruction out of these common 
factors.” Thus not only is language a means of com- 
munication and a medium of record, but Jit is also the 
agency through which the thought that is thus communi- 
cated and recorded can be further developed. 
There is one more function of language, which is of the 
utmost importance. It contributes largely to the affective 
and esthetic development of our mental life. We are thus 
introduced to the literary aspect of language. In this 
chapter little will be said thereon. But it may be well 
to remember that, when this rises to its highest pitch of 
excellence, the subtle music of speech is combined with 
not less subtle harmonies of thought, and that both 
expression and thought are in close touch with the 
realities of existence within the selected universe of 
discourse. And the teacher who is helping the child to 
frame correctly the simple sentences in which he ex- 
presses his naive experience, should from the outset keep 
in view the ultimate aim that, at its best, language should 
be a beautiful embodiment of justly related thought, dis- 
closing the essential nature of the world and of human 
life with all its varied products. 
Can we think without words? This question is often

Language in Dr. Stout’s Analytic Psychology, vol. ii. p. 190.
-P-A-G-E-195
LANGUAGE AND THOUGHT 181 
discussed. It should, however, be subdivided into two 
questions. First, can we now carry out thought processes, 
frame or apply ideal constructions, without verbal 
symbols? To this question we must give an affirmative 
answer. We can think out new moves in chess, invent 
new machines, solve geometrical problems without 
naming the essentially new features. Pictures or images 
are in this case the concrete embodiments of our thought. 
They stand for or embody general notions; and they 
do so more especially where perfectly individualised con- 
nections in time and space are before our mental vision. 
But the further question remains behind. Could we reach 
the level of thinking at which such procedure obtains 
in the absence of language? The answer must be 
conjectural. We have not the data to enable us to give 
a decisive opinion. As a matter of fact, however, mankind 
has reached its present level of knowledge with the 
assistance and partly through the instrumentality of 
language. [ It is difficult to conceive that man could 
have reached his present level of thought in the absence 
of language. ) We must remember, also, that not only are 
words the expression of certain reactions we have acquired 
when we were in social relations to our fellows, but that 
all our thought has likewise been developed in the midst 
of such social relationships. ) Thought, no less than lan- 
guage, involves a process of give and take. “If we 
once understand,” says Professor Royce,? “ how these social 
relations determine that character of our consciousness 
which essentially belongs to all thinking, we become able 
to see why verbal associations and habits should be so 
prominent in connection with all the thinking processes. 
We shall also be able to see what is frequently neglected 
by psychologists, namely, the possibility that processes of 
1 Outlines of Psychology, p. 280. 
 
-P-A-G-E-196
  182 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
thought should, on occasion, appear dissociated from verbal 
expression, though never dissociated from tendencies to 
action which have a social origin essentially similar to that 
of language.” If thinking be a social function, and the 
use of words be also a social function, and if these two 
social functions are continually interacting, the proba- 
bilities are that they are closely connected, even if some 
of our thinking may now be effected without verbal 
symbols. In any case, however, normal educational pro- 
cedure is dependent on the establishment of intimate 
relationships between things, thoughts, and words. 
How language first originated we need not consider. It 
now, without question, forms an essential part of the 
child’s environment with which he has to come into vital 
touch through processes of assimilation. But this part 
of his environment is itself an expression of the experi- 
ence gained in the field of nature, among the products of 
human industry or ingenuity, and through social inter- 
course. The child’s apprehension of the meaning of verbal 
expression is gained along with, and nowise independently 
of, his experience and knowledge of the nature of things 
and the doings of persons around him. At this stage 
the question never arises whether the child should learn 
about things and processes, persons and their behaviour, 
in the midst of concrete situations, or about words and 
sentences, language and speech. The latter without the 
former are sounds without meaning. In all phases of 
perceptual development, practical experience and verbal 
description should be linked together as closely as pos- 
sible. There should still be no question whether the boy 
is to deal chiefly with words or things; he should always 
be dealing both with concrete objects and their verbal 
symbols. At a later stage, when language becomes 
more consciously and explicitly the expression of the
-P-A-G-E-197
  LANGUAGE AND THOUGHT 183 
systematic knowledge, the pupil’s understanding of the 
one should go hand in hand with his comprehension of 
the other. Language must not be allowed to out-run 
thought; nor thought to lose touch with the concrete 
phenomena with which it deals. A discipline in language, 
a discipline in the thought of which that language is 
symbolic, and a discipline in the application of both 
thought and language to what lies within the range of 
experience, are so closely related that they should be 
regarded as diverse aspects of one educational discipline. 
Let us, however, go back to the beginnings of speech in 
the little child. At first the sounds which are to become 
the names of things are simply associated with salient 
features in a concrete situation. But the association is 
of a peculiar kind. It involves a correlation of occurrences 
within, let us say, the field of sight and the field of 
hearing. The sound within the latter is a factor of a 
disposition predominantly visual. And though associ- 
ated with the object, it is not a constituent part of that 
object as such. It does not belong to the object in the 
same way as the barking of a dog or the mewing of a 
kitten belongs to them. There is indeed from the first 
a cross-association, foreshadowing the essential charac- 
teristic of language as significant of something to someone. 
In the child-mind the sounds which carry meaning are 
associated both with the objects indicated and the person, 
mother or nurse, who indicates them. This attachment 
to, and yet at the same time detachment from, the objects 
renders the word-sound peculiarly fitted to call up the 
relevant portion of the body of experience for purposes 
of assimilation. And this is more markedly the case, 
since the same sound is associated with slightly different 
impressions, varying somewhat in slightly different 
situations.
-P-A-G-E-198
  184 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
At first the sound-words associated as factors within a 
perceptual disposition have a merely indicative or sug- 
gestive value. They are directive of the attention. They 
give rise to expectations; and each has its primary 
value in presence of the object by which the expectation 
may be realised. So long as they remain at this merely 
indicative stage their use and force is restricted to the 
here and now within a given concrete situation. It is 
impossible to convey by associative word-sounds, as such, 
what has been the experience of the past or what will be 
the experience of a future beyond the immediate situation. 
And the words the child himself first uses are indicative of 
some present phase of its perceptual experience. They 
are as yet neither analytic nor synthetic. When the child 
says “Up,” for example, that sound is an indication of a 
felt want, and of the expected development of a given situa- 
tion in a certain manner. It is not a “part of speech”; 
for as yet there is no speech to be analysed into functional 
parts. Nor is it an elliptic sentence; for the sentence is 
also as yet unattained. It is just an indicative sound 
which is associated in perception with a bit of unanalysed 
experience. 
And it is an indication of a mode of experience full of 
affective tone. It is sometimes said that the whole vocal 
life of infancy is primarily an expression of feeling. 
This is true enough if we steadily bear in mind that 
with all feeling there is also a cognitional aspect. In the 
child the feeling-aspect is emphatic; and the word-sounds 
are expressive of wants and needs,—of these we may even 
say primarily. But there is always also an incipient 
cognitional reference to that which is wanted or that 
which will satisfy the need. At a later stage this may 
acquire the greater emphasis; until words come to 
symbolise the objects of our experience or of our thought.
-P-A-G-E-199
   LANGUAGE AND THOUGHT 185 
A connecting link between the stage of indicative 
communication and that of descriptive communication, 
when the child is beginning to talk in sentences, is 
afforded when he puts together in juxtaposition two 
sounds indicative of different aspects of sensory experi- 
ence. When the child uses together the two sound-words 
“Bow-wow bark” he is on the verge of, if he has not 
actually reached, predication. Let us suppose that the 
juxtaposition of sounds is merely an expression of the 
association which has been formed between the auditory 
and the visual factors in a coalescent percept. Even so 
the separate sound-words must soon beget the analysis 
into the dog that barks and the barking of the dog, and 
their synthesis in the form of a judgment. The relation 
implicit in the barking dog is rendered explicit through 
the incipient proposition. And when once the child 
reaches this stage of dawning judgment there follows a 
period of marked and rapid progress, due partly to the 
employment of a new and increasing faculty, partly to 
the extension of intercourse thus rendered possible, and 
partly to the fact that his teachers thus acquire a fresh 
leverage to lift him up in his onward course of develop- 
ment. 
It is not necessary here to dwell on the fact that 
imitation is constantly operative in the early stages of 
the use of language. Nor is it necessary to trace the 
genesis of simple sentences in the incipient speech of 
children. It is worth noting, however, that they come to 
the lips of the child in the absence of anything like set 
and formal teaching. That is one reason why, when 
such set and formal teaching begins, we should start with 
the sentence and not with individual words or “ parts of 
speech.” The parts of speech are analytic products, and 
should be reached by analysing the whole of which they
-P-A-G-E-200
  186 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
are parts. As we have seen, the stages of psychological 
development are roughly as follows: first, the correlation 
of the data of experience into perceptual wholes suffused 
with meaning for some form of practical behaviour; 
secondly, the analysis of the perceptual whole into its 
several constituent factors or those which are of leading 
importance; and thirdly, the re-synthesis of the analytic 
results into an ideal construction. Thus starting with 
the naive whole of perceptual experience, we reach by 
analysis and synthesis the corresponding conceptual 
whole of ideational thought. The sentence, as it lives in 
the mouth or on the ear of the child, is similarly a naive 
whole of relatively perceptual experience. With this we 
start. By analysis and synthesis we reach the corre- 
sponding conceptual whole of the sentence as intellectually 
grasped. 
Are we, then, justified in regarding the sentence and 
not the word as the unit of language? I suppose the 
answer to this question depends upon the point of view 
and the purpose in hand. When we have occasion to 
employ language in speaking or writing there is some 
more or less definite topic on which it is our purpose to 
discourse.. In the give and take of conversation and of 
classwork the topic is developed by means of the dis- 
course. Logically, it is convenient to regard the proposi- 
tion as the primary unit of language, expressive of a 
judgment as the primary unit of thought. Of course 
the proposition may be analysed into words, and the 
judgment into ideas. These may be regarded as derivative 
units or analytic elements. It must be remembered 
that what we term a “unit” is just an arbitrarily 
selected factor; and what is taken as a unit depends 
entirely on the purpose in view at the moment. The word 
is what it is only in reference to the proposition of which 
 
-P-A-G-E-201
   LANGUAGE AND THOUGHT 187 
it forms a constituent part; so, too, the idea only lives 
and moves and has its effective being as a factor in some 
judgment. I take it that in regarding the sentence as the 
unit of language we have in view constituent parts, each 
of which is or may be self-contained. In a train, the 
engine, coaches, and guard’s van are the constituent 
units, each of which is a going concern in relation to the 
others. The wheels and axles, doors and hat-racks, are 
rather parts of a carriage than parts of a train. We 
have changed our point of view. A judgment is in itself 
a significant unit of thought; the terms only have 
significance within the judgment. 
Now the precisely worded proposition, and the judgment 
clear-cut in thought, are ideal constructions. Implicit in 
the language employed in daily life and in literature; they 
are rendered explicit in logical form. They are re-syn- 
theses for logical purposes of the more naive and informal 
syntheses of common speech. As such, it may be said 
the schoolmaster has little concern with them. But the 
teacher who is to minister to the most effective use of 
language should be fully aware of the logical implications. 
Formal logic may indeed appear to him a crabbed dis- 
cipline, without obvious bearing on his life-work. But 
the essentials of logic are of value to the teacher of even 
the most elementary subjects. And it is eminently 
desirable to combine the logical point of view with that 
which is more distinctively grammatical. 
It would appear to be in accordance with sound method 
that the first step in the analysis of a sentence should be 
one which leads up to the logical distinction between 
subject and predicate, though not yet expressed in strict 
logical form. On the one hand there is what is spoken 
about, the point of departure of our thought; on the other 
hand, what is said about it, some further development of 
 
-P-A-G-E-202
188 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
our thought. Suppose we are planning an afternoon walk, 
and in response to a question, say: “Three o’clock is the 
time of starting.” I take it that, notwithstanding the order 
of the words, the time of starting is the subject and three 
o’clock the predicate. The latter is put first for emphasis. 
But it is well to place the subject first. If I say that 
the cube of 3 is 27, the cube of 3 is already in mind, and 
27 is affirmed tobe the result which will be reached. 
But if I say 27 is the cube of 3, the whole number is 
in mind, and the assertion is that for the purpose in hand 
it may be resolved into 3°. In a different connection it 
might be resolved into 26 + 1, or 32 — 5. We must always 
remember that a statement is made or a sentence uttered 
for the furtherance of some end. As contributing to that 
end, each implies the other, in the sense that without 
the other it is incomplete. When this is fully realised, 
and it is quite clearly grasped that the sentence is the 
synthesis of the two, the ideational standpoint is reached. 
No doubt in some sentences, those, for example, which 
express a command, the synthesis is not quite obvious. 
But if the teacher says, “ Stand up and recite,” the child 
will understand that the teacher’s wish is the unexpressed 
but implied point of departure, and the act of recitation 
the development. 
A further step in the analysis of the simple sentence 
discloses a distinction, in what is spoken about, between 
the subject proper and its enlargement—that is to say, 
sundry attributive adjuncts which serve to define or limit 
the subject. In the sentence, “The beautiful princess, 
with a blush on her fair cheek: shyly gave the noble 
knight a blue forget-me-not,” the part which precedes the 
colon is what is spoken about; and within it the subject 
“princess” may be analytically distinguished from its 
limitation to “the” princess, and the statement of one
-P-A-G-E-203
  LANGUAGE AND THOUGHT 189 
of her attributes in the word “ beautiful.” It may sound 
paradoxical to speak of the “enlargement” of the subject 
as playing a limiting role. But an enlarged or extended 
statement may, and very often does, limit or restrict the 
thought suggested by the subject. Princess by itself may 
stand for any princess; technically it is “universal”: 
the enlarged statement restricts our thought to the 
beautiful princess of the story. So far we are looking at 
the matter from the logical standpoint, and considering 
what is signified. But concurrently with this we may 
classify the words used according to their function, and 
thus take up the point of view of grammatical analysis. 
In a similar way we may deal with the part of the 
sentence which follows the colon, what is said of the 
subject, the logical predicate. We distinguish the 
predicate verb (termed the predicate in the analysis of 
sentences) ; its completion by the direct object “ forget- 
me-not,” and the indirect object “knight”; sundry 
enlargements of these defining or limiting them; and 
an extension of the predicate verb by the use of the 
adverbial adjuncts which serve to define or limit its 
application. Here, again, we are considering the signifi- 
cance of what is said; but here again we may concurrently 
parse and render clear the grammatical functions of the 
words that are used. It forms no part of my. purpose 
to discuss the analysis of sentences, simple, complex, and 
compound. This to the teacher is or should be quite 
familiar ground. I beg him, however, to remember that 
he should make to himself quite clear the psychological 
and logical function of all the parts, whether separate 
words or clauses, or subsidiary sentences, as expressive of 
thought, and bring these into relation with their gram- 
matical functions. What he has to bear in mind is— 
(1) that (logically) the sentence conveys some information
-P-A-G-E-204
  190 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
—applies to some universe of perception, knowledge, or 
imagination; (2) that it (psychologically) implies certain 
thought processes; and (3) that it is expressed in 
language under the rules of grammatical form. There 
are therefore—(1) relationships among the objects of 
thought; (2) relationships among the thoughts of these 
objects; (3) relationships among the words or clauses 
expressive of this thought; and (4) complex cross- 
relationships between those which fall severally under the 
first three headings. It is because the analysis of sen- 
tences properly conducted affords such a varied disci- 
pline that it possesses so high an educational value. 
It may be so treated as to be replete with interest; but, 
no doubt, it is not infrequently so treated as to be 
amazingly dull. 
In the more strictly grammatical part of his work 
the teacher must never forget that, as Dr. Bosanquet 
says,! “the grammatical analysis which classifies words 
as substantives, adjectives, adverbs, verbs, and the like, 
is not to be taken as telling us what words are by them- 
selves, but just the opposite, namely, what they do when 
employed in a significant sentence. They are studied 
separately for convenience of attending to them, as we 
study the wheels and pistons of an engine: but the work 
which gives them their names can only be done when 
they are together.” That is one thing to remember. 
Another thing is, that we must let our rules grow 
inductively from the examples as they occur in the living 
world of language; not at the outset formulate the rules 
and then set forth on the quest for illustrative examples. 
That may be done later. The rules are generalisations 
from particular cases. They are ideal constructions, and 
are framed by comparing an adequate body of data, and 
1 Essentials of Logic, p. 85. 
 
-P-A-G-E-205
LANGUAGE AND THOUGHT 191 
reaching by abstraction the essential features common to 
all the cases. In other words, preparation and varied 
presentation must precede generalisation, Then applica- 
tion may follow, and the rule may be illustrated by further 
examples, which may be apperceptively assimilated. One 
may, perhaps, go so far as to say that the child should 
not be allowed to see a grammar until his powers of 
grammatical apprehension are such that he is beginning 
to have confidence in them, nor until he has reached, 
under due guidance, a number of generalisations for 
himself, and can see how they are reached. Then he 
may use a grammar, but even then chiefly as a book of 
reference—one to which he may turn, not from which he 
must learn by heart certain rules. 
When a foreign language is added to the mother-tongue 
further opportunities are afforded for that comparison 
which is so helpful in disentangling the universal rule 
from the concrete example. In educational value for this 
purpose (that is to say, wholly independent of its literary 
worth) there is no question that such a highly inflexional 
language as Latin stands far higher than modern 
languages. Indeed, we may say that the comparative 
study of an analytic language like English, and an 
inflexional language like Latin, is essential for the best 
training in the apprehension of grammatical relations. 
In the inflexional language each word bears on its face 
the sign of its relationship. ‘“ Magister pueros docet.” 
The subject is here clearly indicated and marked off by 
its termination from the object as complement of the 
predicate. The time-relation is also clearly shown in the 
form of the verb, In English, though we still retain some 
inflexions, we as a rule indicate the relations either by 
separate words or by position in the sentence. While in 
Latin we say “ docet,” “ docuit,” “docebat,” or “ docebit,”
-P-A-G-E-206
  192 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
the verb itself showing the time-relation, in English we 
say “teaches” and “taught,” so far like the Latin, but 
“was teaching” and “will teach,” here using separate 
words to express the time-relation. In Latin, as in 
English, the grammatical analysis should, so far as is 
possible, be made a matter of direct apprehension in the 
sentence, not a matter of rules learnt by heart in the 
grammar. The headmaster of a grammar school tried, for 
a term, the experiment of giving no grammar work from 
the book, but taught his form to exercise their faculties 
of apprehension on the grammatical relations as they 
naturally arose, and to generalise the results they thus 
obtained. At the end of the term he set an old grammar 
paper that had done duty from time to time at befitting 
intervals; and though the form was nowise above the 
average, the grammar papers the boys sent in were dis- 
tinetly above the average. It is, from the grammatical 
standpoint, as a means of training the faculties of com- 
parison and generalisation, that the study of such a 
language as Latin side by side with English is so 
valuable. 
To return now to the more distinctly logical stand- 
point, even a simple sentence contains by implication a 
number of propositions. The princess is beautiful; the 
knight is noble; the forget-me-not is blue; and so 
forth. By breaking up complex statements into the 
definite propositions which they contain or imply, the 
judgments are rendered explicit. This brings us back to 
the nature of the ideal constructions of logical science. 
Logic analyses a proposition into subject and predicate, 
connected by the copula (is or is not), which is merely 
the symbol that the two are brought into synthetic 
relationship. It stands for the attitude of acceptance 
underlying the judgment. It is simply the recognised
-P-A-G-E-207
   LANGUAGE AND THOUGHT 193 
mode of expressing in a proposition that there is a judg- 
ment, or again it is a sign that subject and predicate 
are distinguishable, but connected factors in a given 
whole. In the ideal constructions of logic the statements 
made in complex sentences are broken up into a series 
of propositions, each expressing a single judgment, and 
each in the present tense. The grounds on which the 
judgments are made, and their connection and dependence 
on each other, are thus rendered clear. 
The child’s earliest affirmations and judgments arise 
directly out of his perceptual experience. Each expresses 
some aspect of reality in and for that experience. Each 
is made in relation to some interest of the moment. 
Each implies that others to whom the affirmation is 
made have like experience. And each implies also the 
assimilation of the present experience to that before 
gained under like circumstances. When the child says 
“T saw a mouse,” or “I shall pick buttercups,” reference 
to the past and expectations of the future become ex- 
plicit. But each statement expresses an aspect of reality 
within this time-reference. It may sound pedantic to 
say: “The nature of reality is such as to include my 
seeing a mouse yesterday,” or “is such as to include my 
picking buttercups this afternoon.” I do not suggest 
that the teacher should talk like this to a class of 
children. None the less it may be well for him to 
realise that every judgment is concerning the nature of 
reality in some universe of thought, and that for the 
purposes of the ideal construction of logic all historical 
statements (for example) can be thrown into the present 
tense by making reality the subject of a predicate with 
historical reference. This brings out the attitude of ac- 
ceptance in the name of reality, symbolised by the 
copula. Not until the child realises that, in saying that
-P-A-G-E-208
  194 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
he has seen this or done that, he is affirming something 
of reality, does he begin to grasp the distinction between 
fact and falsity; and not until he realises that the falsity 
may be accepted by the hearer as an affirmation concern- 
ing the nature of reality, does he grasp the distinction 
between truth and falsehood. 
What, however, it may be asked, is meant by reality? 
It may sound almost absurd to say that statements made 
in the fascinating story of Jack and the Beanstalk are 
affirmations concerning the nature of reality. But from 
the logical standpoint reality is to be understood as that 
which is essential to self-consistency within some universe 
of discourse. It may be the universe of the natural world, 
or that of history, or that of physical conceptions; but it 
may also be that of Shakespeare’s Hamlet, that of 
Thackeray’s Pendennis, that of Jack and the Beanstalk. 
Some presentation, backed up by an interpretation within 
its appropriate universe of discourse, is what is here to 
be understood by reality. I take it that the child often 
fails to distinguish the different universes which for us 
are distinct enough, for example the universe of his- 
torical fact and the universe of imagination. And this 
sufficiently accounts for some of the so-called lies of 
little children. 
The proposition then makes an affirmation concerning 
the nature of reality. Distinguishable aspects of ex- 
perience or of knowledge are connected by the copula 
in the expression of a synthetic judgment. Let us, how- 
ever, be quite clear as to the analysis and synthesis 
involved in the apprehension of a comparatively simple 
descriptive sentence. It helps us more fully to grasp the 
connection between perceptual process dealing with con- 
crete experience, and ideational process dealing with ideas 
and concepts, having universal application within their  
-P-A-G-E-209
  
LANGUAGE AND THOUGHT 195 
appropriate spheres. If we say to a child, “ Mother saw 
a black cat in an apple tree at the end of an old garden,” 
the words must pass through the lips and enter in at 
what John Bunyan called the ear-gate single file. The 
child, if he had been at his mother’s side, might have 
taken in the whole situation at a glance. To describe 
it, however, the whole experience must be broken up 
into constituent factors, which have to be expressed 
serially. They can be expressed in no other way; such 
is the nature of language. This inevitably involves 
analysis, but if the description is understood the con- 
stituent factors must be combined to form a whole of 
representative experience. This inevitably involves syn- 
thesis. Ideational thought renders the analysis and 
synthesis explicit. 
What, we may now ask, is the force of the term 
“universal” as applied to words? Take, as an example, 
the black cat in an apple tree. There are an indefinite 
number of black cats in the world, and an indefinite 
number of apple trees. The words, as such, will apply 
to any black cat and to any apple tree. The technical 
term “universal” implies this wide range of application. 
If images are called up they are representative of the 
universe of black cats and the universe of apple trees. 
The extent of the universe of application varies. The 
term “cats” has a wider application than “black cats”; 
the term “trees,” than “apple trees.” The qualifying 
words introduce differences which serve to limit the 
application. Incidentally, therefore, these phrases involve 
the principles of classification. Technically, “cats” and 
“trees” name the genus of which “black cats” and 
“apple trees” are species. In the sentence addressed to 
the child even the word “mother” is a universal. By 
itself it applies to any mother: there is nothing in what
-P-A-G-E-210
  196 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
is actually expressed to limit the application; but the con- 
ditions of the moment do practically limit the reference to 
the child’s own mother. Even so, however, the name is 
in a sense universal. The child has had a great number 
of diverse experiences of mother; as a term referring to 
the centre of all such experiences, it embraces them all. 
It does not in itself apply to mother sitting indoors with 
baby on her knee, mother dressed for a dinner party, 
mother in her evening-gown kissing “ good-night.” The 
conditions of the sentence suggest mother in her after- 
noon attire, walking in that garden and catching sight of 
that black cat—that is to say, the universe of own mother 
under the particular limitations of a concrete situation. 
We thus see in what sense it may be said that the 
words in daily use are universals, and also in what way 
they find their particular application. Adjectival ad- 
juncts serve in some degree to limit them, restricting 
their universe. But above all, the specific conditions of 
discourse, and the existing circumstances under which 
“names are uttered, not infrequently give the universal a 
quite particular application—as in addressing the sen- 
tence above considered to a child, when “mother” is 
not only limited to his mother, but to his mother in a 
definite situation. If I speak of a “blackboard” the 
universe of “board” and of “black” mutually limit 
each other. This may be illustrated diagrammatically, 
by intersecting circles thus— 
the shaded part showing the limited universe of “ black- 
board.” Under the conditions of the schoolroom this is 
further defined as the kind of blackboard used therein. 
And I may further particularise by the use of the word
-P-A-G-E-211
   LANGUAGE AND THOUGHT 197 
“this.” Even “this” as a word is a universal. It may 
be applied to “this book,” this “ink-stand,” this “ any- 
thing.” But under given circumstances it brings the 
conceptions embodied in language into touch with per- 
ceptual experience. 
It will be remembered that in the first chapter the 
nature of ideas as general, as involving abstraction, and as 
free to enter into new combinations, was illustrated by that 
which answers to the word “clock.” Now “clock” im- 
plies certain essential characters. The central idea is that 
it is a kind of timepiece. But it applies to a great number 
of objects, some one of which may be actually perceived, 
or re-presentatively imaged. Let us now bring this into 
connection with the distinction drawn in logic between the 
denotation and the connotation of names. “ A term’s de- 
notative function is to be the name of something, or some 
multitude of things, which are said to be called or denoted 
by the term. Its connotative function is to suggest cer- 
tain qualities or characteristics of the things denoted, so 
that it cannot be used literally [as opposed to figuratively] 
as the name-of any other things; which qualities or 
characteristics are said to be implied or connoted by the 
term. . . . When, for example, we apply to anything the 
term ‘sheep’ we imply that it has certain qualities: 
‘sheep’ denoting the animal, connotes its possessing 
these characteristics.”+ As Dr. Bosanquet? puts it, 
“The denotation of a name consists of the things to which 
it applies, the connotation consists of the properties which 
it implies. . . . In short, the denotation of a general name 
is simply the meaning of its’ plural or of its singular, in 
the sense in which it implies a plural, while the connota- 
tion is the meaning per se, not considered in its instances. 
1Carveth Read, Logic Deductive and Inductive, pp. 29, 36. 
? Bernard Bosanquet, The Essentials of Logic, pp. 88, 90.
-P-A-G-E-212
  198 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
. . . It is clear, then, that every name has these two kinds 
of meaning—first, a content, and then instances, whether 
possible or actual, of the content; and the two are obvi- 
ously inseparable, although they are distinguishable.” 
The connotation of the name being thus what it implies, 
the purpose of definilion is to express the essential core 
of connotation for some purpose in hand as briefly and 
accurately as possible, making clear the significance of 
the idea or concept for which it stands. Precise definition 
is, however, a late product of our thought when it comes 
to logical maturity. We should not attempt to define 
to a child the connotation of the common names he is 
beginning to use with freedom and ease. So near the 
level of practical experience we should, as a rule, when 
he is puzzled, resort to denotation; in other words, we 
should probably direct the child’s attention to the objects 
to which the name by common consent applies. At the 
perceptual stage of development it is through behaviour 
that things acquire meaning; and words, at first, are sym- 
bolic of such meaning. They imply in the first instance 
something which he can do with the objects they name, or 
something which they can do to him. This he may be 
able to describe long before he reaches the stage of exact 
definition. And presumably the majority of us would find 
it a hard task to define all the names we use in any five 
minutes of the ordinary conversations of daily life—if 
indeed it were worth while. We are not then moving in 
the universe of discourse,—that of rational argument,—in 
which the strict definition of each individual term is in 
place. The meaning of words and phrases in the familiar 
speech of daily life is rendered sufficiently clear by the 
context. This shows that we can say what we mean, and 
understand what others tell us, without making clearly 
explicit to our thought the exact significance of every
-P-A-G-E-213
   LANGUAGE AND THOUGHT 199 
word. As a matter of fact we do nothing of the sort: we 
just grasp the net result of what is said, and present like 
net results in customary phrases. It is only when we 
reach the level of precise systematic knowledge—that of 
clear and concise reasoning, cogent argument, and logical 
proof—that the definition of the terms we employ, or a 
sense of confidence that we could define them if necessary, 
is essential. 
Discipline in mathematics, geometry, and physical or 
biological science involves the definition of terms. Without 
having learnt any formal rules the boy can define, more 
or less accurately, petal, insect, sulphide or phosphate, 
energy and momentum, a straight line or a triangle. He 
can tell us that a triangle is a figure bounded by three 
straight lines and containing three angles. This, of course, 
is a plane triangle—but, if spherical triangles have not 
yet been considered, the term triangle for him is the 
plane figure. Logically, the words “containing three 
angles ” form, I take it, no essential part of the definition. 
It is a property of figures bounded by three straight lines 
to contain three angles. Properties are not expressed in a 
definition ; but they may be inferred or derived from what 
is so stated. It is a property of triangles that the three 
angles are equal to two right angles. If we define an 
equilateral triangle as one in which the three sides are 
equal, it is a property of such a triangle that the three 
angles are also equal. But we might, with equal accuracy, 
define in terms of the equality of angles, in which case 
the equality of the sides would be a property. An 
accident is an attribute which is neither connoted by the 
term nor such as can. be inferred from its definition. 
Sometimes accidental qualities are common to a whole 
class, but if they are not included in the definition nor 
implied in it as properties, exceptions to their universal 
 
-P-A-G-E-214
a i a ka ll 
200 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
occurrence may be found. All the metals known a hun- 
dred years ago were heavier than water; but though this 
is an accidental quality of most metals, potassium, sodium, 
lithium, etc., are now known to be exceptions. 
Closely connected with definition is classification. In- 
deed the two proceed hand in hand. The term triangle, as 
defined, is the name of a class of plane polygonal figures. 
Let us tabulate: 
(1) Polygonal figures. 
(2) Triangles. Others (e.g. rhomboids). 
  fret te (8) Acute-angled. Others (e.g. right-angled). 
(4) Isosceles. Others (e.g. equilateral), 
There is a definite basis of classification. The stages are— 
(1) many-angled figures, (2) figures with only three 
angles, (3) all of which are acute, (4) two of which are 
equal. That which marks off each stage, working down- 
wards, from the preceding group, is termed the difference ; 
and the groups at each stage are said to be sub-ordinate 
to that above it, and co-ordinate with others on the same 
line. Thus isosceles triangles are co-ordinate with equi- 
lateral triangles and sub-ordinate to acute-angled. The 
co-ordinates are termed species, sub-ordinate to the genus 
above them. At the top of the table is the highest 
genus, at the bottom the lowest species. But the terms 
“genus ” and “species” are logically relative. Triangles 
form a species in relation to polygons: but a genus in 
relation to acute-angled triangles. The connection be- 
tween classification and definition is thus clear. We de- 
fine an isosceles triangle by indicating the difference which 
marks it off from the genus to which it is sub-ordinate—
-P-A-G-E-215
   LANGUAGE AND THOUGHT 201 
that which contains acute-angled figures, within the 
higher genus of triangles. Such definition was said of old 
to be per genus et differentiam. The phraseology may 
sound pedantic; but whenever we limit a common name by 
an adjective—when, for example, we speak of a “red 
rose” or a “humorous story ”—we are applying the prin- 
ciples of classification and definition. 
It must be remembered that any definition is of value 
for some purpose and within some universe of discourse, 
and is accepted by common consent. The logical definition 
of “genus” and of “species” is implied above. In biol- 
ogy these terms are applied to certain limited stages of 
the classification of animals and plants. Let us tabulate: 
Animals, 
  
  
  Vertebrates. Others, 
Others. Mammals. 
Carnivora. Others, 
Others, Felidae. 
Others, wae 
Others. Felis catus, 
Zoologically the term “genus” is by common consent 
restricted to the group Felis, the term “species” to the 
“ Felis catus,” comprising wild and domestic cats. To the 
other logical genera other terms, such as “ family,” “ class,” 
etc., are applied. The table given is illustrative, not ex- 
haustive. Modern zoologists would insert other stages. Of 
 
-P-A-G-E-216
202 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
course under others several groups may fall, for example, 
Felis tigris, F. leo, F. leopardus, ete. Under F. catus fall 
individual cats, including mine, whose proper name is 
“Sir Thomas.” 
The questions, discussed by students of logic, whether 
proper names have any connotation, and what is the rela- 
tion of connotation to denotation in the abstract name, 
need not be considered. Such discussions may seem some- 
what subtle and formal. The teacher may regard them 
as of little service to him. But their value lies, not so 
much in the decision at which we arrive, as in the exercise 
it entails in thinking out the functions of the words we 
are constantly using. A proper name, it is urged, has no 
connotation, because, though it may suggest much which 
experience has disclosed, it does not necessarily imply, as 
a name, any definable qualities or attributes. It is attached 
for purposes of recognition to an individual person, a place 
to be specified, a particular event. It just denotes a unique 
identity. On the other hand, the proper names, William 
Shakespeare, London, French Revolution, have for most of 
us a significance which seems to be rather arbitrarily dis- 
tinguished from connotation. And Dr. Bosanquet? says 
that such proper names do connote “whatever may be 
involved in the identity, or is instrumental in bringing it 
before the mind.” All adjectives are unquestionably con- 
notative (including, I suppose, Shakespearian, Darwinian, 
and the like), they connote or imply certain attributes; 
and all predicates are or have the force of adjectives. 
From them abstract names or attribute terms are derived, 
such as hardness, purity, strength. Here what is denoted 
is the attribute itself. But what, if any thing, is con- 
noted? In the case of singular abstract names there seems _ 
nothing left for them to connote—though even such a term 
as resistance seems to imply material as contrasted with 
1 Essentials of Logic, p. 93.
-P-A-G-E-217
  LANGUAGE AND THOUGHT 203 
immaterial properties. “ But when an abstract term is the 
name of a group of attributes, there seems no good reason,” 
says Mr. Welton, “for denying that it is connotative. 
Thus, virtue is a name common to justice, benevolence, 
veracity, and other qualities of conduct which men agree 
in regarding as praiseworthy; it, therefore, denotes those 
good qualities, and connotes the attribute ‘ goodness’ 
which they possess in common.” I must repeat, however, 
what I said above, that the value of such discussions lies 
in making us pause and think of the real significance of 
the words we are daily using. 
And now, having glanced at the logical implications of 
individual words, let me once more emphasise the import- 
ance of fully grasping the fact that they merge their 
individuality when they are in actual use. It is essential 
that the teacher should steadily bear in mind that what 
his pupils should be thoroughly familiarised with is the 
free life of words—with the individuals as they live, move, 
and have their being in the natural world of language. 
In a dictionary they are dead. They are like insects 
pinned out in a cabinet or like birds stuffed in a museum, 
each with its descriptive label. The dictionary museum— 
like other museums—has its educational function, but 
only in due relation to the natural occurrence of that 
which is found therein. Our smaller dictionaries contain 
all the words in common use, each with a brief definition 
of its meaning or significance. These names are like 
stuffed birds in a museum, each perhaps in its most 
characteristic attitude, but how different from the living 
creature! Suppose we know quite well the sea swallow 
or tern standing there on the shelf amid other sea-birds. 
Are we sure of recognising it on the coast-line as it lives 
its joyous life? So, too, with words. We look out 
1 Manual of Logic, vol. i. § 36, iii. p. 89. 
 
-P-A-G-E-218
  204 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
“breath” in Chambers’s Htymological English Diction- 
ary; we find that it is “lit. steam, vapour; the air drawn 
in and then expelled from the lungs; a single breathing or 
the time it occupies ; fig. life; a pause; an instant; a gentle 
breeze.” And then we go out for a breath of fresh air, 
and feel that the breath of spring is on the country. Our 
bird has not been stuffed in either of these attitudes. Look 
out the words “ delicate,” “shade,” and “reference,” in 
the dictionary, and see whether the museum definitions 
suggest just those “delicate shades of reference” which 
are found in the free life of words. 
If our smaller dictionaries are like verbal museums, our 
larger dictionaries are analogous to zoological gardens. 
For sentences or phrases are given from accredited writers 
in which the words live—but under cramped and artificial 
conditions. For any word in a sentence or phrase torn 
from its fuller context, though it has more vitality than 
‘it has in the museum, still lacks the wider backing of its 
free literary life. It may seem an exaggeration to say that 
you cannot understand any phrase of In Memoriam unless 
you know the whole poem; and yet it is true that the 
atmosphere of the whole pervades every part. You may 
exhibit your beaver and his builded dam in a cage; but 
the surrounding Canadian swamp, which forms the natural 
setting of the wild creature, is absent. And the moral 
of all this is, not that we should abolish our museums 
and zoological gardens, which serve a useful educational 
purpose, not that we should burn our smaller and larger 
dictionaries, but that we should, wherever possible, first 
study animals and words in their native haunts, and re- 
member that museums and dictionaries are secondary aids 
to and for reference. 
And when we turn to the dictionary in this way we 
find for each word (unless it be a technical term in some
-P-A-G-E-219
LANGUAGE AND THOUGHT 205 
branch of art, craft, or science) not one significance, but 
several, as in the example “breath” cited above. Some 
words preserve their literal significance but have other 
figurative uses; in others the literal meaning has become 
obsolete. But the point is that which usage (of the several 
that are given) applies in any particular case, is determined 
by the context in which the word is found as an organic 
part of the living tissue of language. What the dictionary 
gives is a list of the leading lines of reference for each 
word—the bigger and better the dictionary the fuller the 
list. But which is educationally of great value: to learn 
by heart an exhaustive list compiled by the very latest 
authority, who has garnered all that his predecessors have 
won from the field of literature, and added some few grains 
to the store, or to compile for oneself a little meagre list, 
every grain of which has been personally gathered in the 
sunshine and fresh air of the smaller field in which one 
has gladly reaped? “ For,” as Professor Adams * reminds 
us, “each of us makes his own little dictionary, which 
agrees more or less with those of others.” This private 
and internal dictionary which we make as we go along our 
educational way, is a bit of real knowledge won by our 
own thought and experience in the field of language. We 
can supplement it by turning to the printed pages of the 
stout volumes on our shelves; but the essential thing is 
to have our own private store of significant reference to 
serve as a nucleus. “The standard dictionary, then,” as 
Professor Adams says, “ must be treated as the terminus ad 
quem, not as the starting-point in education. The pupil 
must first learn to use his own private internal dictionary, 
and then learn to compare and correct it with the 
standard dictionary.” And the teacher who guides him 
1 John Adams, The Herbertian Psychology applied to Education, 
p. 186. This racy little book will well repay careful study. 
 
-P-A-G-E-220
206 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
in his task must always remember that nature-study in 
words should begin in the free country of language as it 
lies open to our observation. 
There is one more point that may here be noted. Pro- 
fessor Adams * puts it clearly and concisely when he says: 
“Words as found in actual use, may be divided into 
two great psychological classes, as transitive and sub- 
stantive. The latter we can pause upon and consider; the 
former are always upon the wing. The distinction does 
not correspond to the parts of speech, and has little to do 
with grammar.” The transitive elements in language 
therefore correspond to the relational turns of our 
thought as it passes from one substantive concept to 
another. Our psychology is too apt to deal almost 
exclusively with the substantive concepts, partly because 
it tends to study knowledge as arrested in a sort of 
instantaneous photography and does not sufficiently 
realise that the essential feature of our thought lies in its 
free movement. In the instantaneous photography of 
language the words which stand for the transitive states 
are in a sense caught and held for our inspection. But 
the more carefully we inspect them when thus caught, the 
more does their function as transitive elude us. For we 
inspect them in and for themselves as units; we tend to 
isolate them. But it is just as isolated in and for them- 
selves that they lose their transitive force. It is only as 
thought flies past them, almost heedless of their existence, 
that they are of relational value. Thus it is true, as Pro- 
fessor Wm. James?” says, that we ought to speak of “a 
feeling of and, a feeling of if, a feeling of but, and a feel- 
ing of by, quite as readily as we say a feeling of blue or a 
feeling of cold.” The worst of it is, that the more steadily

2? Principles of Psychology, vol. i. p. 247. 
Z
-P-A-G-E-221
  LANGUAGE AND THOUGHT 207 
we focus our attention on the and, the but, and the if, the 
less does it represent these elements in a living sentence 
along which thought moves freely. Professor James * 
fully realises this. He says: “ Now it is very difficult, in- 
trospectively, to see the transitive parts for what they 
really are. If they are but flights to a conclusion, stopping 
them to look at them before the conclusion is reached is 
really annihilating them. Whilst if we wait till the con- 
clusion be reached, it so exceeds them in vigour and activ- 
ity that it quite eclipses them. . . . The attempt at intro- 
spective analysis in these cases is in fact like seizing a 
spinning top to catch its motion, or trying to turn up the 
gas quickly enough to see how the darkness looks.” Still, 
though there is this difficulty in all introspection, yet in 
retrospection we can look back, and to some extent, and 
not altogether inadequately, apprehend the nature of the 
transitive states, the relations of our thought, as they 
occurred when the thought was in full flow. In any case 
this brief allusion to the transitive elements in language 
and in thought may serve to emphasise once more how 
essential it is to deal with the free and living organism, 
and not merely with the most elegantly mounted museum 
specimens.

  CHAPTER VIII 
DESCRIPTION AND EXPLANATION 
We have seen that practical experience deals with the 
concrete phenomena of the world in which we live, while 
systematic knowledge deals with general conceptions and 
ideal constructions in terms of which such phenomena may 
be interpreted. Language ministers to the development 
of both. Description is in closer touch with practical 
experience as such: explanation brings the experience into 
relation with systematic knowledge. Description gives 
an answer to the question “How?” Explanation to the 
question “Why?” And it is clear that in logical order, 
and in psychological development, description should pre- 
cede explanation. 
Even description, however, as we have seen, implies 
analysis into constituent factors and their synthesis into a 
whole, which may be understood as such. It is a means 
of ideational intervention between the perceptual experi- 
ence of the speaker and that of the hearer. But the idea- 
tional character of the intervention is rather implicit than 
explicit. 
It is clear that in order that description shall effect its 
purpose, the words employed should carry meaning for 
practical experience; but they may be so ordered as to 
indicate the nature of that which has not yet been experi- 
enced. We wish, for example, to describe quicksilver to 
208
-P-A-G-E-223
  DESCRIPTION AND EXPLANATION 209 
a class of children. We say that it is something like this 
pewter in its brightness and the way in which it reflects 
light; it is even heavier than this lead; it is liquid like 
oil, so that it could be poured from one vessel to another. 
And we perhaps qualify each of these statements by 
additional comparisons between the unknown quicksilver 
and things the children can see and handle. Now all the 
words we employ are “universals,” but our object is to 
prepare the class for what they would find quicksilver to 
be in actual experience. We thus see that the function 
of description is to be preparatory to or supplementary 
of actual experience. And wherever possible it should be 
allowed to lead up to observation, for which it is only a 
temporary substitute. Such observation is sure to disclose 
much which was not introduced into the preliminary 
description; and the children should be asked themselves 
to describe the additional features they observe. Thus 
description may be made a test of the range and accuracy 
of observation. 
It is, however, quite impossible to put to the test of 
personal observation all that we learn through descrip- 
tion. Huxley required a volume to deal with the common 
crayfish; and it would take the student months or years 
of careful observation to render all the statements in that 
work part of his own individual experience. In geography 
the pupil learns much from description which he will 
probably never have an opportunity of observing for 
himself. For no one can the whole realm of experience 
recorded in language have that full and complete mean- 
ing which can only be acquired through personal 
investigation. Much must be accepted on the testimony 
of competent observers. What, then, can we do? How 
do we stand? I take it that the educational ideal is to 
establish such foundations of direct and first-hand experi-
-P-A-G-E-224
    210 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
ence as shall support the superstructure of description, 
and shall supply the sense of confidence involved in 
ability to submit any statement to the touchstone of 
observation. That should be the result of practical 
work in the physical, chemical, or biological laboratory. 
Description is the paper currency of experience. The 
trained student can convert this paper currency into 
observational coins of the realm of experience when 
opportunity offers and need arises. And he has had so 
much experience of such conversion that he knows what 
paper currency is valid and what is spurious; what may 
be at once accepted, and what demands observational 
confirmation before it can be counted as a safe asset at 
the bank of scientific knowledge. Is not one of the main 
functions of education to teach pupils how to test the 
paper currency of description? 
Description, then, is preparatory to observational experi- 
ence, or supplementary thereof, and incidentally affords a 
valuable means of testing the accuracy and range of 
observation. It is also an exercise in the clear, correct, 
and effective use of language. Its relation to assimilation 
—or the incorporation of new experience within the body 
of the old—is close. We might speak of assimilating a 
description and be well within the common usage of the 
term. But it might conduce to clearness if we were 
to reserve “assimilation” for the process of incorpora- 
tion through direct observation, and to use the term 
apprehension for the preparatory or supplementary in- 
corporation by the hearer of what is communicated 
through description. If, for example, we describe the 
nest and eggs of the golden-crested wren which may be 
found beneath the deodar spray in a certain position in 
an old garden, the information conveyed will be appre- 
hended by those who have some practical experience
-P-A-G-E-225
  DESCRIPTION AND EXPLANATION 211 
of birds’ nests. But this will not have the same value as 
direct assimilation by actually finding and seeing the gold- 
erest’s nest. If, however, we employ the terminology 
here suggested we must bear in mind that we are imposing 
limitations on both these terms, and must be prepared 
to find in the course of our reading many cases in which 
they are used interchangeably. 
It is perhaps worth noting here that nature-study 
lends itself admirably to the wise employment of 
description as preparatory to observation, and of further 
description as supplementary of what has been observed. 
Nature-study also affords ample material for a training 
in the art of descriptive expression in suitable language 
on the part of the children themselves. It should be 
freely utilised in relation to exercise in composition, since 
it is in such close touch with what children have actually 
seen in the field of nature, and also affords insight into 
their modes of regarding natural objects and occurrences. 
But it also offers abundant material for generalisation, 
it introduces our pupils to classification, and fosters the 
attitude of comparison. Of course the generalisations 
reached, the classification adopted, the comparisons insti- 
tuted, are not yet adequate for the purposes of exact 
science. But in so far as they arise in contact with 
actual phenomena, in so far as they deal with what the 
child himself observes, and in so far as they are genuine 
of their kind, their educational value may be great; and 
they may also lay the foundations not only of a desire to 
interpret more adequately the world in which we live, 
but also of a fuller appreciation of the wealth of beauty 
and interest with which that world is stored. 
Both description and generalisation presuppose analysis, 
and the process of comparison through which, as we have 
seen, the products of analysis and the relations they
-P-A-G-E-226
  212 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
involve are rendered explicit. We describe, for example, 
a pebble we have found on the beach as oval, grey, 
moderately heavy, tolerably hard, and made of limestone. 
In doing so we make predominant in succession the 
several salient features of the object, and this, as we 
have seen, is just what is characteristic of the process of 
analysis. In the corresponding act of apprehension the 
pupil takes these several features, given to him, from the 
nature of the case, in succession, and combines them by 
an act of synthesis into a whole. Not until the several 
features are thus combined can he be said to apprehend 
the description as a whole. But suppose a child asks, 
“Why has the pebble this rounded form?” We give him 
as a preliminary answer, “Because it has been rolled 
about by the waves.” And if he then asks—as we should 
encourage him to ask—“ But why does the rolling of it 
by the waves give it a rounded form?” we should, if 
opportunity occurs, take him down to the beach, show him 
how the waves are rolling the pebbles over each other 
and knocking them against one another; describe in 
particular cases how each stone has its angles knocked off 
and rubbed down; and when he has apprehended this 
description, get him to comprehend the generality of the 
result. All the pebbles are thus rounded; among others 
perhaps some pebbles of bottle-glass. It is, given suf- 
ficient time, the universal and uniform result of this 
mode of natural action. When he has comprehended this 
generality of the effect produced, we give him the ex- 
planation of the rounded form: “ Because the pebble has 
been rolled about by the waves, and it is found that 
such rolling always gives rise to a rounded form.’ This 
explanation, and its due comprehension, involve analysis, 
for we are making the shape predominant to the temporary 
subordination of other features presented by the pebble; 
 
-P-A-G-E-227
DESCRIPTION AND EXPLANATION 213 
and it presupposes generalisation, for we explain it by 
showing that it is a particular example of the action of a 
general law. It is true that this explanation is of a low 
order of generality, not going far beyond the description of 
the particular case; but it does involve generalisation. 
While description has primary reference to the body of 
practical experience and ministers by ideational means, 
and through the universals of language, to its extension, 
explanation has a more explicit ideational character, is 
always in conscious touch with the system of knowledge, 
and brings the particular case into definite relation to the 
general principle or universal rule. We may describe, for 
example, how (that is to say the manner in which) a dry 
needle, if gently lowered on to the surface of water, will 
float. Our pupils will apprehend the description if they 
have seen other bodies, such as sticks and straws, floating. 
By trying the experiment for themselves they may assimi- 
late the fact through observation. So far there is no 
explanation; perhaps no need of explanation is felt. 
Children, and for the most part the majority of older folk, 
are quite content to accept experience at its face-value 
without asking, why? And this question seldom arises 
unless there is some discrepancy between the results of 
observation and that which expectation suggests. Wooden 
matches float. Few children think of asking why. We 
have to prompt them to do so. If we then tell them that 
the match floats because it stays at the top of the water, 
we are merely expressing the same fact in other terms. 
If we say that it floats because it is lighter than water, 
our answer may be a valid explanation. It is a particular 
case which exemplifies certain universal properties of 
bodies in accordance with which they always, if free to 
move among each other, arrange themselves under the 
influence of the earth’s gravitative attraction, in order of 
   
-P-A-G-E-228
  214 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
weight from the greatest to the least. The lighter match 
gets on top of the heavier water. The heavier pebble goes 
to the bottom of the relatively lighter water. But the 
steel needle is heavier than water, and should therefore 
go to the bottom, as indeed it does if put into the water 
point downwards. There is thus a discrepancy between 
the action of the dry needle lowered lengthwise on to the 
surface and the general rule. We expect it to sink, but 
as a matter of fact it floats. This calls for explanation, 
Why does it float, notwithstanding the fact that it is 
heavier than water? Now we cannot adequately and fully 
explain this to a pupil who has not a system of physical 
knowledge of considerable coherence and complexity. 
None the less we may to some extent give a valid explana- 
tion, so far as it goes, even to children. We can only do so, 
however, by describing and performing other experiments. 
We dip our finger in water, and see a drop adhering to the 
end as if it were enclosed in an invisible elastic bag. 
Again, we fill a wine-glass nearly full of water, and then 
add more, little by little, until the liquid rises above the 
level of the rim. What holds the water back and prevents 
it flowing over the brim? It looks as if there were an 
invisible elastic skin which restrains it. Again, we make 
a closed loop in a piece of wire and dip it into water, and 
note the thin sheet of liquid which fills the loop. What 
keeps the water stretched across the opening? May it 
not be a delicate surface film? We may take a clay pipe 
and soapy water and blow bubbles. Having blown a fairly 
large one, still attached to the pipe bowl, we watch it 
slowly contract. What pulls it together? The tension of 
the surface film. Thus, as the result of a number of 
different experiments and observations, we lead up to the 
conclusion that a peculiar property of the surface of water 
is disclosed by them. There is an elastic surface film. If
-P-A-G-E-229
   DESCRIPTION AND EXPLANATION 215 
now we say that the dry needle floats because it fails to 
break the surface film, we are referring the particular 
case to a general rule which we have found to hold good 
under various conditions. So far as it goes this is a valid 
explanation. We describe the several cases, enable our 
pupils to assimilate the facts by actual observation, fuse 
the results in a general concept concerning the nature of 
the surface film, and explain the particular case as an 
example which falls under a general rule. It will be 
noticed that each experiment is a presentation for which 
the previous consideration of the whole matter is a pre- 
paration. By comparing the presentations with a definite 
end in view we lead up to the generalisation. The next 
time we are by a pond’s side we may see if our pupils 
have sufficient powers of application to tell us why the 
long-legged insect skaters are able to walk on the water, 
not sinking into it, but merely indenting its surface. If our 
pupils have no systematic knowledge of molecular physics 
we cannot carry the explanation farther. We must be 
content with having shown that the possession of a surface 
film is (so far as our observations have carried us) one of 
the properties of water. In this case the man of science 
can go a stage farther, and explain why water has a surface 
film. But if we go on asking similar questions he, too, at 
last is forced to say: “ This is the way in which things are 
constituted.” The teacher should be very careful to re- 
member that if he “explains” this constitution of things 
as so made by God, he is using the term “explains” in a 
different sense. He is not stating in general terms that 
which is common to a number of presentations: he is giving 
an answer to the quite different question how there come to 
be presentations which we can deal with systematically. 
In the one case we are accepting our experience and build- 
ing a scheme of knowledge out of the data which, by ab-
-P-A-G-E-230
  216 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
straction, we derive from the experience. In the other case 
we are endeavouring to account for the fact that we have 
experience and can attain to knowledge. The end—in both 
senses of the word “end”—of natural explanation is a 
knowledge of the constitution of nature—not of its origin. 
A good many years ago, when I was a young student, a 
clever lad in Cornwall asked me the old question, “ Why 
does a stone fall to the ground?” Not wishing to put him 
off with the long-sounding words, “ Universal gravitation,” 
I replied, “ Because it is heavy.” “But a feather is not 
heavy, and yet it falls to the ground,” was the prompt 
answer. I replied that the feather was relatively heavier 
than the air. The lad was silent for a moment, and then 
said, “ That’s just one of the things I want to know: does 
the air fall to the ground and collect there like water in a 
pond, only we cannot see it because we are in it and it is 
invisible?” I saw that this lad’s powers of comprehension 
were fully equal to the occasion, and explained the whole 
matter as best I could. I told him that he was quite right 
in supposing that the air, like the stone and the feather, 
was attracted by the earth; I pointed out the universality 
of gravitation as a law of nature; and then reverting to 
his first question, I said, “ You now see that we explain 
the fall of the stone as a particular case of the action of a 
law that is universal in its generality.” He was again 
silent for a moment, and then asked, “ But what makes 
the earth attract it, after all?” I laughed, and said, 
“Yow’re a philosopher! Nobody can answer that question. 
Perhaps you may live to find it out, or at anyrate to 
understand the solution when it comes, as come it may.” 
The explanation of the fall of a stone by reference to 
universal gravitation is a valid explanation; but the expla- 
nation is partial and incomplete, not final and ultimate. 
We cannot give a final and’ ultimate explanation of any
-P-A-G-E-231
  DESCRIPTION AND EXPLANATION 217 
of the phenomena of nature. We explain this, that, or the 
other natural occurrence by a reference from the particular 
to the general; but if we are asked, “Why are these 
general laws what we find them to be? ” the only scientific 
answer is: “That is how nature is constituted.” 
We have seen that the avenue to ideational process is 
through comparison, by which we reach inductive general- 
isations and apply them deductively to particular cases. 
Induction and deduction are complementary processes. In 
the life of thought we constantly oscillate between the 
example and the rule. Thus we raise comparison to a 
higher plane. It goes to and fro between the particular case 
as an instance of a universal principle, and the universal 
principle as exemplified in the concrete case. In view 
of the general rule the particular case is apperceptively 
assimilated to the system of knowledge. The relations 
peculiar and special to explanation are those which we 
symbolise by the terms “therefore ” and “because.” And 
the logical attitude it fosters is that of inference. “You 
obtain the most vital idea of inference,” says Mr. 
Bosanquet, “by starting from the conclusion as a sug- 
gestion, or even as an observation, and asking yoursclf 
how it is proved or explained. Take the observation, 
‘The tide at new and full moon is exceptionally high.” In 
scientific inference this is filled out by a middle term. 
Thus the judgment pulls out like a telescope, exhibiting 
fresh parts within it as it passes into inference. ‘The 
tide at new and full moon, being at these times the lunar 
tide plus the solar tide, is exceptionally high.” This is the 
sort of inference which is really commonest in science.” 
In the specialised ideal cénstructions of formal logic, 
we have the syllogism in which three propositions contain- 
ing three, and only three, terms are brought into relation 
under certain formal rules. These rules we cannot here 
 
-P-A-G-E-232
  218 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
attempt to discuss; nor can we consider the different 
kinds or figures of syllogism. It must suffice to give a 
simple example in the first figure. Take the syllogism— 
All rodents have chisel-teeth ; 
The mouse is a rodent; 
Therefore the mouse has chisel-teeth. 
The final proposition is called the conclusion, and the other 
two from which it is derived are called the premisses. 
The predicate of the conclusion is spoken of as the major 
term, the subject of the conclusion being called the minor 
term; while the third term, which forms the subject of the 
first proposition and the predicate of the second, is known 
as the middle term. The premise which contains the 
major and middle terms is called the major premise; that 
which contains the minor and middle terms, the minor 
premise. It is convenient to express the syllogism in its 
most generalised form by using symbols for its terms. 
Thus, denoting the major term by P (because it is the 
predicate of the conclusion), the minor term by S (as 
subject of the conclusion), and the middle term by M, 
and representing the copula by . , we have the following 
generalised form of such a syllogism in the first figure of 
formal logic: 
M. -4eP = 5) 
S:3M 3 
eran 9. aes, 
There are, however, certain rules to be observed. We 
have seen that any name denotes the objects to which it 
properly applies. A term is technically said to be dis- 
tributed when definite reference is made to the whole of 
its denotation, that is, to the whole range of objects to 
which it applies. If we say: All sheep are herbivorous, 
we express a universal affirmative. The term “sheep” 
is distributed; but not the term “herbivorous.” There 
 
-P-A-G-E-233
DESCRIPTION AND EXPLANATION 219 
are other herbivorous animals than sheep. What we 
mean is, that all sheep are included in the larger group. 
We neither mean nor say that all herbi- 
vorous animals are sheep. This may be ex- 
pressed diagrammatically in Fig. I. The es y P 
shaded part S is included within, but is not \@ } 
co-extensive with P. If we say: Some sheep 
are black, we express a particular affirma- E 
tive. Neither term is distributed. There are 
other sheep which are not black, and other 
objects which are black. In Fig. II. the cir- 
cles intersect, and the assertion is only made 
with regard to the shaded portion of each. 
If we say: No sheep are carnivorous, we 
express a universal negative. Both terms eS 
are distributed. For we must think of the q 
whole universe of carnivorous animals and 
the whole universe of sheep before we can @ 
be sure that the groups are mutually exclu- 
sive. The circles in Fig. III. have no part 
in common. If we say: Some sheep are not 
black, we express a particular negative. 
The subject is not distributed; but since we 
are thinking of the whole group of not black 
objects as including “some sheep,” the 
predicate is said to be distributed (Fig. IV.). 
If now we place these propositions in 
order they run thus: 
I. Every 8 is P. 
II. Some Ss are P. 
III. No § is P. 
IV. Some Ss are not P. 
It is clear that I. includes II., and III. includes IV., but 
that on the basis of II. we cannot jump to I., nor on the 
   
-P-A-G-E-234
  220 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
basis of IV. can we jump to III., save for the purposes 
of ideal construction. It is also clear that I. and IV. are 
contradictory, as are III. and II. Of each of these pairs 
of propositions one must be true and the other false: there 
is no alternative. But I. and III. are contraries. The 
assertions are poles asunder. Both cannot be true, but 
both may be false. There is the alternative of II. With 
regard to II. and IV. both may be true; some sheep are 
black and some are not black. But they cannot both be 
false; if there are such animals as sheep, they must either 
be black or not black. 
Now in any syllogism, or in any combination of three 
propositions which may be thrown into syllogistic form, 
we have first to remember that there must be only 
three terms, and each term must be used in one sense 
only. The term “ good teacher” may mean a man who 
teaches well or a good man who teaches. We cannot 
therefore say that because Mr. Smith is a “ good teacher ” 
he must be a “good teacher,” though the terms (apart 
from the emphasis) are the same. The following rules 
must also be observed. The middle term must be dis- 
tributed in one of the premisses, and no term must be dis- 
tributed in the conclusion which has not been distributed 
in one of the premisses. That is to say, we must not jump 
from “some” to all. Because witty boys are clever, and 
some Irish boys are witty, we cannot reach the conclusion 
that all Irish boys are clever. Nor, if we grant that all 
schoolmasters are able men, can we infer that Mr. Brown,- 
who is an able man, is a schoolmaster. The next rule, 
that from two negative premisses no conclusion can be — 
drawn, is sufficiently obvious. Suppose it were true that 
the study of classics is not a useful discipline, and that 
German is not a classical study, there is nothing in these 
premisses to justify the conclusion (though it may be
-P-A-G-E-235
  DESCRIPTION AND EXPLANATION 221 
true in fact) that German is a useful discipline. If one 
premise is negative the conclusion must also be negative. 
Suppose children have been told that the higher animals 
either breathe oxygen dissolved in water by means of 
gills, or breathe the atmosphere by means of lungs, still it 
would be incorrect to say that, because young tadpoles 
breathe by means of gills, and the grown frog is not a 
tadpole, it must breathe by means of lungs. It does 
not logically follow that because a frog is not a tadpole 
its mode of breathing changes, although as a matter of 
fact this is the case. From two particular premisses no 
conclusion can be drawn. It may be quite true that some 
boys are good cricketers and some are also industrious, but 
it does not follow that some good cricketers are indus- 
trious, nor even that some are not. Finally, if one of 
the premisses is particular, the conclusion must also be 
particular. Granted that all poisonous creatures are harm- 
ful to children, and that some snakes are poisonous, 
it does not follow that all snakes are harmful, though 
children may be advised not to touch any snake, so as to 
avoid possible risk. 
Failure to observe any of these rules, for example in 
the manner above indicated, involves a formal fallacy of 
deductive logic. But apart from the detection of fallacies 
(which, after all, are generally disclosed by the application 
of a little common sense) the educational value of 
elementary logic, like that of the analysis of Sentences, 
consists in the discipline it affords. It should be employed 
as an exercise, first, in converting assertions, made in the 
varied modes of literary or scientific expression, into 
propositions in logical form; and, secondly, in throwing 
into syllogistic figure the conclusions reached by inference. 
There is, however, as Dr. Bosanquet points out, some- 
what of a paradox in inference. “We have not got
-P-A-G-E-236
  222 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
inference unless the conclusion—(1) is necessary from the 
premisses, and (2) goes beyond the premisses. To put the 
paradox quite roughly—We have not got inference unless 
the conclusion is—(1) in the premisses, and (2) outside 
the premisses.” So obviously is it in the premisses, so little 
does it lie outside them, that in many of the elementary 
examples of the syllogism we are tempted to feel that it 
is hardly worth while stating the conclusion at all. If 
all rodents have chisel-teeth, the mouse included, of course 
it, too, has chisel-teeth. It should be remembered, how- 
ever, that the syllogism does not profess to indicate the 
manner in which inferences are reached; but rather a 
form in which they may be so stated that their validity 
may be tested. 
Inferences are continually being reached in all depart- 
ments of school work. It may be helpful to consider 
a particular case selected from comparatively elementary 
work in physical measurement. We take a lath of box- 
wood of convenient length to act as a lever. Across the 
middle, on the lower side, is a notch which fits on to a 
triangular fulcrum. The upper surface is marked with a 
scale of units of length, say inches, twenty on either side of 
the middle line above the notch, and numbered from this 
line outwards. We have also a box of weights in ounces 
from one to twenty. We now make experiments in balanc- 
ing the weights on the lever. We find that

Now from these cases we can draw the inductive in- 
ference that if we double the weight we must halve the

distance. Here, then, is a generalisation. If it holds 
true of other like cases we may deductively infer that, 
for example, 
Weight. Distance. Weight. Distance. 
9 at, 16 will balance 18 at 8 
3 « 12 “ 6 “ 6 
5 “ 2 “ 10 “ 1 
and so on. The correctness of each inference may be 
shown by experiment. The pupils may now be required 
to find out for themselves what will be the result of 
trebling the weight, or multiplying it by any whole num- 
ber, and may be led up to the wider generalisation that 
x times the weight must always be placed at + times 
the distance. They may also be led to see that the 
product obtained by multiplying weight by distance on 
one side of the fulcrum is always equal to the similarly 
reached product on the other side of the fulcrum. 
In a subsequent lesson the procedure may be slightly 
different. The pupils may be told to place the 6-ounce 
weight at 6-inch distance. They may be also directed 
to find out at what distances 2, 3, 4, 9, 12, 18 ounce 
weights must be placed on the other side in order to 
preserve a balance, and to tabulate the results.

The measured values on the graph are proportional

to preserve the conditions of balance. A curve drawn 
through the several points obtained by observation, 
represents the generalisation which may be drawn in- 
ductively from the observations. Now suppose we wish 
to know at what distance a 5-ounce weight must be placed 
in order to balance the 6-ounce weight at 6-inch distance. 
We see from the graph that the vertical line repre- 
senting 5 ounces cuts the curve where the horizontal 
line representing about 17.2 inches also intersects it. 
We therefore infer from the generalisation curve that 
this is the distance at which a 5-ounce weight must be 
placed. We apply the generalisation, through its graphic 
representation, to a particular case, and can test with the 
lever the correctness of our inference. Technically we 
say that we have interpolated a point on our curve. It 
may be said that many cases of exact inference are of the 
nature of interpolations on a curve; or in some cases 
extra-polations on the curve as prolonged beyond the 
limits of actual observation. The curve in this case is 
of a definite kind—it is a branch of a rectangular hyper- 
bola. It can be prolonged indefinitely in either direction. 
This may serve, with more advanced pupils, to bring the 
exercise in simple physical measurements into touch with 
other branches of mathematical work. And it may 
readily be shown that, on the graph, the rectangular areas 
of which the ordinates and abscisse severally define the 
limits, are all equal, affording another relationship with 
other disciplines. 
No opportunity should be missed of bringing any given 
bit of work into relation with other studies, perhaps 
conducted in quite different classrooms. A further 
example may be given. Balance equal weights at equal 
distances on the lath, remove the fulerum, and support 
_ the lath on a loop of string fitting into the notch.
-P-A-G-E-240
  226 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
Then set the whole rotating, and show that the weights 
rotate evenly around the point of the lathe which is in 
the vertical line of the string. By other experiments with 
unequal weights bring out the fact that, under the con- 
ditions of balance, the centre of rotation is the middle 
point of the notch. Take a special case, and make it 
clear that two weights, respectively 1 and 8, will rotate 
around the centre at distances respectively 8 and 1. Ask 
what the respective distances will be if the weights or 
masses are 1 and 80. Bid the pupils imagine that the 
lath and the string melt away, leaving only the two masses 
swinging round in space at a distance of 240,000 miles. 
Lead up to the inference that the common centre will be 
2 
in miles 20,090 or 2961.73 (nearly) from the centre of the   
larger mass. And make clear that masses of the earth 
and the moon are in the proportion of 80 to 1; that they 
are 240,000 miles apart; that the point around which 
they rotate is therefore about 2962 miles from the centre 
of the earth; that, since the length of the earth’s radius 
is 3960 miles, the centre of rotation lies within the 
earth; and that we are therefore justified in affirming 
that the moon revolves around the earth. Similarly 
make clear that, if physical principles established in the 
laboratory hold good throughout the solar system, the 
earth must revolve around the sun, or more exactly, the 
earth-sun system rotates around their common centre, 
situate some 300 miles from the centre of the sun. If 
the pupils have sufficient knowledge, it may be shown 
that the inferred motion of the earth in space is verified 
by observations on the aberration of light coming from 
the distant stars. 
Let us now return to our graphic representation of a 
scientific generalisation in the form of a curve. The

   drawing of the curve on the basis of a number of exact 
observations is a case of inductive inference. What we 
say in effect is, that if all the cases are in line with the 
observed cases, the generalisation expressed in the curve 
holds good. Life may not be long enough to observe all the 
possible cases: but if, whenever we test the generalisa- 
tion by new cases, they duly fall on the curve, our belief 
in its validity is confirmed. We assume that it is uni- 
versally true, until in given instances it is shown by ob- 
servation to be false. And we assume that it is absolutely 
true as an ideal construction, until observation discloses 
measurable errors. We must then explain the cause of 
error, and, if necessary, modify our generalisation. When 
we have reached our generalisation curve we apply it 
deductively to particular cases. We interpolate points on 
the curve; and such interpolation is deductive inference. 
This brings us back to the paradox of inference. The 
interpolated point is already within the curve (or logically 
within the premisses), but the particular case may never 
have been considered, may never before have been 
rendered explicit. In this sense, then, it may be a new 
fact added to our stores of knowledge. We may never 
before have realised that it was already implied in our 
generalisations. Our pupils in the laboratory may not 
ave grasped that in our experiments with lath and 
eights swinging round the centre of the notch, we were 
stablishing principles which throw light upon the problem 
f the revolution of the moon round the earth and that of 
he earth round the sun. 
Whenever in matters of exact science we can dis- 
ntangle two related factors we can express the generalisa- 
ion in a graphic curve or condense it into a mathematical 
ormula. It is part of the ideal construction to assume 
at these two factors, and these only, are present, and to
-P-A-G-E-242
  
228 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
   
        
   
                                                 disregard disturbing influences. Thus we can express 
by such a curve the relation between the time taken 
and the space moved through when a body falls, or we 
can condense the generalisation in the formula s = 16¢?, 
where s is the number of feet and # the square of the 
number of seconds. But here we neglect the resistance 
of the air. It forms no part of the ideal construction. 
In the inferences of everyday life, however, in those 
statements which we make or accept in an attitude of 
belief, there are often more than two factors; they are not 
exactly measurable, the generalisations are less definite, 
and cannot be expressed in a smooth curve on squared 
paper. None the less it may be said that the acceptance 
or rejection of such statements does depend upon whether 
they fall within or altogether outside the curve of our 
experience and of our knowledge founded thereon. If 
you tell me that within the universe of actual life a boy 
nine years old ran a mile in four minutes, I decline to 
accept the statement. It does not fall within the rough 
and inexact but relatively serviceable curve I have formed 
from the records of the athletic field. If I see it stated 
that Cromwell told a deliberate lie to attain a mean end I 
reject it as false, because it does not accord with my 
conception of the Protector’s character. If, again, a 
novelist makes his heroine take a certain line of action, I 
may exclaim, “I don’t believe she would have acted 
in such a way.” And if I am asked to explain the 
grounds of disbelief, I reply in effect (though I may put 
it less pedantically) that the action is right off the curve of 
the ideal construction which the author has himself in 
earlier chapters delineated. He has failed in making the 
character consistent within the universe of an artistic 
treatment intended to be true to life. Once more, i 
must be remembered that what we accept in the attitud
-P-A-G-E-243
DESCRIPTION AND EXPLANATION 229 
of belief is always within an appropriate universe of dis- 
course. In a work of imagination such as Mr. H. G. 
Wells’s Invisible Man, I at once accept the scene in the 
rain, where a film of water in human shape is seen pro- 
ceeding down the street. I surrender myself to the con- 
ditions within the imaginative universe of discourse. 
Granting that the man himself was invisible, but that one 
could see the water which wetted him, a sort of filmy soap- 
bubble in human shape is exactly what one would expect. 
It falls within the curve of experience under the circum- 
stances created by the imagination. Hence my glad 
acceptance in the attitude of belief of Mr. Wells’s clever 
development of his theme. 
We commonly distinguish belief and knowledge. But 
they shade the one into the other. Both are mental 
attitudes which we take up in face of what we call facts; 
and facts are always interpreted by thought in terms of 
belief, when we realise that there is some uncertainty in 
the interpretation, or of knowledge when we have proved 
the correctness of the interpretation. So regarded, belief 
belongs to the intermediate region between naive per- 
ceptual acceptance and the conceptual assurance of 
organised systematic knowledge. Its correlate is the 
presence or possibility of doubt. Some authors, however, 
contend that belief is never complete until all doubt is 
excluded. In any case there is involved the taking into 
consideration the relation between generalised experience 
and some particular case. Still, the explicit grounds of 
belief often come to no more than an assertion that the 
accepted interpretation does, as a matter of what we 
call fact, fall within the curve of our experience. This, 
after all, is for most of us the test of truth. Indeed, it is 
questionable whether there is any other test of truth than 
congruity and consistency with the fully organised system 
   
-P-A-G-E-244
  230 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
of knowledge. But, as Mr. Welton reminds us, as 
knowledge is always advancing and being re-organised, it 
is often impossible to say with perfect assurance that any 
particular item of our interpretation of the world is true. 
Further knowledge may, in many cases, necessitate a 
revision of such interpretations in the future as in the 
past. Where the organisation of knowledge is still very 
far from approaching completion, as in children, we have a 
readiness to accept any interpretation offered—we have an 
attitude of credulity. 
The generalisations of daily life are for the most part of 
the nature of only partially confirmed and scarcely at all 
verified guesses. The majority of us, and this is especially 
true of children, jump hastily to general conclusions on 
a slender basis of observation and often on mere hearsay. 
And we are only too prone, as are children, to render 
an explanation of particular occurrences in the light of 
very unsystematic knowledge. Apart, however, from 
slipshod, hasty, and faulty generalisations or opinions 
founded on a wholly inadequate body of data, and these 
data uncritically accepted, the problems themselves are 
often exceedingly complex, contain many diversely related 
factors, and are therefore peculiarly difficult to deal with 
systematically. We see this, for example, in the questions 
arising out of recent Education Acts, or out of fiscal 
policy, or out of the condition of South Africa. Each of 
us forms his own opinions; but they contain much that 
is hypothetical, an over-emphasis on those factors which 
appeal to our special prejudices, and, in fine, a net result 
which we are often incapable of submitting to logical 
analysis. No doubt education ought to do something 
towards preparing the rising generation to deal with the 
larger social problems in which this difficulty is most 
acutely felt. But guidance is afforded rather through the
-P-A-G-E-245
  DESCRIPTION AND EXPLANATION 231 
insensible influence of a wise teacher than through any 
set and formal discipline. Sound opinions are the outcome 
of that most subtle and indefinable attribute of a minority 
of human folk which we call wisdom; and this it is hard 
or impossible to teach. Only through the insight and tact 
of a wise man can it be fostered. And in the best 
education in the field of the humanities much is done 
in this direction. 
In the field of nature the problems are simpler, and it 
is far easier to frame ideal constructions the validity of 
which may be tested. That is one of the reasons for the 
modern advocacy of science teaching. It is (among other 
things) a discipline in the framing and testing of possible 
and probable explanations. Common and familiar ob- 
servations may often be made the starting-point, for it is 
always desirable, wherever possible, to bring experimental 
work and scientific treatment into touch with familiar 
occurrences. 
It is not infrequently the case that when certain natural 
phenomena have been carefully observed and accurately 
described, two or more alternative explanations are pos- 
sible. Such alternative explanations are termed hypo- 
theses. To decide between them, we need what is termed 
a crucial observation or experiment. We see, for example, 
the sun, moon, stars, and planets rise in the east, sweep 
across the heavens, and set in the west. Now, it is a 
generalisation from a great number of observations, that 
the apparent movement of a body external to ourselves 
may be due—(1) to the actual movement of that body 
while we are stationary, or (2) to our own actual move- 
ment, the external body being stationary, or (3) to the 
difference between its movement and our own. The 
apparent diurnal movements of the sun, moon, and stars 
may be due, then, to the revolution of the heavens round
-P-A-G-E-246
  232 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
the earth, or to the rotation of the earth, or to a difference 
between the two. These are the alternative hypotheses on 
which the observed phenomena may be explained. In 
times gone by the generally accepted hypothesis was that 
the heavens revolved around the earth. Now, as we all 
know, the accepted hypothesis is that the earth rotates on 
its axis once in about twenty-four hours. What has con- 
vinced us that this is the true explanation? What was 
the crucial observation or experiment? 
Consider a “conical pendulum,” i.e. a weight, at the 
end of a fine thread or wire, which is capable of swing- 
ing freely; set it swinging; its plane will remain un- 
altered unless something interferes with it from without. 
Why should it alter? There is no generalisation which 
enables us to answer this question except by saying that 
there is no reason why it should alter; but, on the other 
hand, there is a very wide generalisation to the effect that 
bodies remain in their state of rest or of uniform motion, 
except in so far as they are influenced from without. We 
can, however, put the matter to the test of experiment 
by setting a pendulum (a weight at the end of a fine 
thread will serve the purpose) swinging in a pail. Now, 
while it is swinging, turn the pail round, making the 
vertical line containing the point from which the weight 
is suspended the axis of its rotation. The plane of 
swing remains unaltered in direction; thus we obtain 
experimental proof of the constancy of the plane of oscil- 
lation. We are now in a position to apply experiment 
to our special problem. A long heavy pendulum is sus- 
pended from a lofty ceiling, with special precautions to 
secure perfect freedom of oscillation; if now this be set 
a-swinging at 12 noon, and the direction of its swing be 
carefully noted, by stretching a string, for example, 
beneath and parallel with the swinging point; and if,
-P-A-G-E-247
DESCRIPTION AND EXPLANATION 233 
after leaving it for three hours, the pendulum and the 
string be again observed, it will be found that the point is 
no longer oscillating parallel with the string, but across it 
at an angle the precise value of which depends on the lati- 
tude of the place. Since, then, the plane of oscillation of 
the pendulum has remained unaltered, it must be the string 
that has moved. But the string was fixed to the floor, and 
the floor to the solid earth. Hence it is the earth that 
has twisted round. And it can be shown that the 
amount of twisting is just that which should be produced 
if the earth is rotating once on its axis in twenty-four 
hours. This was the great French physicist Foucault’s 
crucial experiment. There are others; but this suffices 
for purposes of illustration. Such a crucial experiment 
verifies one of the alternative hypotheses. And it is 
characteristic of the hypotheses framed in the course of 
scientific work and in the interpretation of nature that they 
are susceptible of such verification. They present clear 
issues which can be put to the test of experiment. Work 
in the chemical laboratory affords ample opportunity for 
the suggestion and testing of hypotheses. No doubt the 
pupils should be led to frame their own hypotheses; but 
they should also be led to appreciate the essential value 
of crucial experiments of historical import. The earlier 
chemists, for example, observed that metals were rendered 
heavier by calcination; but this might be due either to 
the loss of something light by nature, which’ was then 
termed phlogiston; or the gain of something heavy by 
nature. Lavoisiér calcined tin in an hermetically sealed 
vessel. The weight of the vessel before and after calcina- 
tion was precisely the same. Neither had anything light 
by nature been lost, nor anything heavy by nature been 
gained. But when the vessel was opened air rushed in. 
The calcined tin had increased in weight by ten grains.
-P-A-G-E-248
234 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
Ten grains of air rushed in. Hence the tin had absorbed 
something from the air. Every boy in the chemical 
laboratory now knows that this was oxygen. But 
Lavoisiér’s crucial experiment led to the rejection of the 
hypothesis of phlogiston. It may be.said that our pupils 
to-day have no time to dally with the rejected hypotheses 
of the past. That may be so. But even supposing that 
we are resolved to exclude historical treatment and deem 
it unnecessary to show the grounds on which early inter- 
pretations were shown to be false; still the experiment 
(apart from any mention of phlogiston or Lavoisiér) 
serves well to exemplify the method of deciding between 
rival hypotheses. The calcined metal may be heavier be- 
cause something relatively light has been driven off, 
leaving behind the relatively heavy substance; or it may be 
heavier because it has absorbed something. The experi- 
ment decides which hypothesis is correct, and opens up 
the further question: “ What has been absorbed? ” 
The testing of rival hypotheses, then, establishes the 
validity of an explanation, but only on the condition that 
all rival hypotheses are thus excluded. 
In such sciences as astronomy, physics, and chemistry it 
is comparatively easy to disentangle the factors which 
are the essential antecedent or accompanying conditions 
of any given change—at any rate, in those branches which 
come within the range of school discipline. In geology, 
botany, and zoology it is more difficult. In the sciences 
which deal with social matters it is yet more difficult. 
The antecedent and accompanying circumstances are 
often very complex. ‘Those, and those only which are 
really relevant, constitute the cause (from the scientific 
standpoint) of any occurrence which we term the effect. 
They are the essential conditions. To begin with, we 
commonly start with a vague notion that all the preceding 
 
-P-A-G-E-249
  DESCRIPTION AND EXPLANATION 235 
and accompanying circumstances contribute in some way 
to the result we observe. If some are selected as the 
more important, the preference is often given to those 
which in themselves arrest the attention, or are in 
accordance with some bias. The aim of scientific pro- 
cedure is methodically to exclude those circumstances 
which are irrelevant. It is clear that if certain ante- 
cedents are present in some cases, while in other cases 
there are no such antecedents, the result remaining the 
same, these occasional and accidental circumstances may 
be safely excluded. But if we find that all cases agree 
in the presence of certain other antecedents, the presump- 
tion is that they are essential. We have a basis for 
further inquiry. Constant conjunction, so far as observa- 
tion goes, may be provisionally interpreted as evidence of 
constant connection. Such presumption is strengthened, 
and such provisional interpretation is further justified 
if there is a proportional variation in the conditions 
and their outcome. If the tides vary in a manner in 
accordance with the position of the sun and moon, the 
attractive influence of these bodies is with greater confi- 
dence interpreted as the cause of these tides. But the final 
test of the validity of any explanation, in terms of the 
essential conditions, is congruity with the system of knowl- 
edge within which the interpretation properly falls. And 
this consideration guides the man of science at every step 
of any investigation into causes. If, then, irrelevant 
circumstances are excluded, if there is a constant con- 
junction in experience of certain antecedents and the 
events which follow, if with any variation of the supposed 
conditions there is a proportional variation in that which 
we interpret as the effect, and if the explanation thus 
reached is congruous with the total ideal construction of 
systematic knowledge, we have valid grounds for asserting 
   
-P-A-G-E-250
  236 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
that we have discovered the connection which we term 
that of cause and effect. No doubt we must assume the 
uniformity of nature: that is a presupposition to the very 
existence of systematic knowledge. In other words, it 
is part of the ideal construction of science. Its justifica- 
tion lies in its successful application in the interpreta- 
tion of nature. We might, indeed, describe the disorderly 
happenings in a world in which there was no uniform 
connection between cause and effect. But we could explain 
nothing. We could frame none of those generalisations 
which afford a basis for explanation. 
Both description and explanation presuppose someone 
to whom, or for whose sake we describe or explain. They 
refer to the action of the giver, and imply one who 
receives. If we agree to use the term “ apprehension ” 
for the answering activity on the part of the receiver 
in the case of description, analogy and etymology suggest 
the employment of the term “comprehension” for the 
part played by the receiver of an explanation. One 
who readily understands a description may therefore be 
said to have good powers of apprehension; one who 
readily understands a verbal explanation, to have good 
powers of comprehension. We briefly considered the 
relation of apprehension to assimilation, and regarded the 
former as a substitutive process preparatory to, or supple- 
mentary to the more direct and first-hand incorporation 
of new items of experience involved in the latter. If, 
however, we regard the relation of comprehension to 
apperception from a similar standpoint, we shall find 
that the signification of the two terms is often nearly 
identical. For unless we limit in some way the defini- 
tion of apperception, for example to original thought 
and research, the two names seem to stand for the same 
mental process, This arises from the close and intimate
-P-A-G-E-251
     DESCRIPTION AND EXPLANATION 237 
connection of language and thought. A body of practical 
experience can be built up (and much of our eminently 
useful acquaintance with the surrounding world is as a 
matter of fact so built up) without any aid from words 
and language. But for our system of knowledge we are 
very largely dependent on this aid. Language is an 
indispensable tool for the fashioning of thought—both 
in its individual and its social development. So that 
very much of our apperception can only be effected 
through the comprehension of oral or recorded explana- 
tion. Still it is well to retain the two terms, though their 
significance may so nearly, or in some cases completely, 
coincide. For just as description is an aid to more 
perfect assimilation through direct and first-hand ex- 
perience, so is explanation an aid to the more fully and 
completely personal and individual activity implied in 
apperception. To one who already apperceives, through 
the system of knowledge which has become part and 
parcel of his mental being, explanation is unnecessary. 
It is just where the system of knowledge is in- 
complete and inadequate that explanation supplements 
and strengthens it. But it often happens that we 
comprehend perfectly what is explained to us to-day, 
and yet to-morrow, or next week, shall require to have 
the matter again explained. This is because the supple- 
mentary part of the system which the explanation provided 
was not intimately and thoroughly incorporated in our 
system, so as to be bone of its bone and flesh of its 
flesh—a living organic part of its mental tissue. If, 
then, we desire to crystallise out this distinction, we may 
say that, in so far as comprehension concerns only supple- 
mentary additions to our system of knowledge, not fully 
incorporated therewith, it falls short of thorough apper- 
ception; but that in so far as an explanation, given to us
-P-A-G-E-252
238 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
perhaps by some expert, contributes to the organic growth 
of our scheme of ideational construction, its comprehen- 
sion is merged in the higher and more complete process of 
apperception to which it ministers. 
I have illustrated simple and direct inference, and 
likened it to interpolation on a graphic curve. But in 
many cases inferences are reached by disclosing properties 
not at first sight obvious, which are implied by our ideal 
constructions. Thus geometry discloses step by step all 
the essential properties of the triangles, circles, or other 
figures with which it deals. So well ordered is its pro- 
cedure that it is taken as the type of exact reasoning. 
It exemplifies those characteristics of methodical pro- 
cedure which Mr. Welton sums up by saying that it “ omits 
nothing, takes up the points one by one, and takes them 
up in such an order that it goes from the starting-point 
to the fulfilment of the purpose by consecutive steps, each 
of which is seen in its true relation to every other, and to. 
the inquiry as a whole.” 
Fallacies of method generally arise from failure 
adequately to grasp the relation between the starting- 
point and the conclusion, and from deviations in the 
true logical course between the one and the other. The 
question is often asked, What are the chief fallacies to 
which children are prone? I find this a difficult question 
to answer. Presumably little children, though they make 
many mistakes, are scarcely at the ideational stage wherein 
the term “fallacy” is properly applicable. The word 
“because ” is often used by them without any clear under- 
standing of its logical significance. The child simply finds 
it a handy conjunction, which is often used by his elders, 
e.g. “I’ve been out for a walk, because I’ve picked a lot 
of daisies.” “I saw the stars shine, because the moon was 
there.” No doubt such cases, which show a vague realisa-
-P-A-G-E-253
  DESCRIPTION AND EXPLANATION 239 
tion of some connection, may pass into the fallacy to which 
we are, all of us, liable—post hoc ergo propter hoc. Events 
are continually following each other. They are linked in 
customary experience; and the word “because” is a con- 
venient word by which to name the fact of sequence, little 
more. The idea of causation is in children very vague: 
as it is in uneducated folk. A fisherman on the south 
coast complained that the weather had been bad because 
“it hadn’t no chance against that there glass,” pointing to 
a Fitzroy barometer. I don’t suppose he could have given 
any explanation of a connection which practical experience 
showed to exist. A yokel will tell you that he killed a 
slow-worm because it stings. There is a mistaken iden- 
tification of the limbless lizard with snakes; and the 
word “sting ” is used for the bite of a snake. He fails to 
distinguish, and uses words wrongly. But it is scarcely a 
fallacy; for it is scarcely a reasoned conclusion. Children, 
like the rest of us, make the mistake of connecting by 
“because ” different modes of making the same statement. 
The boy says: “ Arithmetic is rot, because it is rotten 
stuff.” But even his teacher may inadvertently remark 
that German is more difficult than French, because it is 
less easy to master. Neither of them is consciously taking 
the attitude of serious reasoning. Still the germs of 
fallacy are present. They are further developed if the 
pupil or his master gives irrelevant reasons for conclusions 
to which they are already committed, ¢.g. Latin has no 
value as a school discipline, because little or no use is 
made of it in after-life. Again, children, like the rest of 
us, jump too rapidly to conclusions based upon insufficient 
data, and apply them carelessly and thoughtlessly. I asked 
a boy what he had learnt that day in his science lesson. 
He at once replied, “ All bodies expand when heated.” 
I found that he had seen the well-known experiment with
-P-A-G-E-254
  240 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
Gravesande’s ring, and had been shown the expansion of 
mercury in a thermometer. The only other example he 
could adduce was that water, frozen in a tightly-corked 
bottle, broke the glass because in becoming ice it ex- 
panded! Many of our common words are used in more 
senses than one, and mistakes arise from this cause. 
Human laws or enactments imply a law-giver; but 
scientific laws or generalisations are universalised state- 
ments of observed facts. We must not, therefore, say that 
scientific laws imply a Divine law-giver. The conclusion 
may be true; but it cannot be shown to be true by using 
one word in two senses. If we say that mice are rodents, 
and therefore have chisel-shaped incisor-teeth, we must 
remember that “mice” in the statement does not include 
“shrew-mice,” which are not rodents. I suppose the chief 
things for teachers and others to bear in mind are—(1) to 
guard against all forms of ambiguity in the use of words; 
(2) not to pass lightly from “some” to “all”; (3) to 
make quite clear what has to be proved, and from what 
grounds the proof proceeds; and (4) to keep within the 
argument, being especially careful in the use of analogy 
and illustration.

  CHAPTER IX 
THE ASTHETIC APPEAL—ENGLISH LITERATURE 
In the last chapter we dealt with the logical appeal to the 
individual mind as rational. When explanation and ap- 
perceptive assimilation have fulfilled their function, 
personal beliefs are brought in line with the systematic 
knowledge of the community at large. It is part of the 
aim of educational procedure to contribute to this end. 
But education should bring the developing mind into vital 
touch with the whole environment. And within that 
environment there is much which should appeal not only 
to the cognitive, but also to the affective side of our 
complex nature. The attitude of appreciation is not 
less important than those of apprehension and com- 
prehension. 
The term “appreciation ” implies a realisation of value 
for some purpose; and it may be taken also to imply some 
response to the affective or the esthetic appeal. Our 
interests are stirred, and we are pleasurably moved. To 
appreciate an argument is not only to acquiesce in its 
logical validity, but to feel that it is well put. Both in 
its cognitive aspect, and on its affective side, our mind is 
enriched. Even in the more specifically intellectual dis- 
ciplines, therefore, it should be part of our aim to foster 
the development of an appreciative attitude. But it is in 
the realm of art—in architecture, sculpture, painting, . 
2a1
-P-A-G-E-256
Lo 
  242 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
music, and literature—that the esthetic appeal reaches its 
highest expression. No opportunity should be missed of 
bringing our pupils into vital touch with this part of their 
environment. And in Nature-study the esthetic appeal 
should not be neglected. It is, however, in literature, in- 
cluding all forms of harmonious expression, through lan- 
guage, of experience and thought, of feeling and emotion, 
and predominantly in our own literature, that the teacher 
finds the most abundant material through which to fos- 
ter the germs of appreciation. 
There would seem to be some people who, in adult life, 
have little or no appreciation of literature. They see, for 
example, nothing particular to admire in Tennyson’s 
beautiful lines— 
“ And Morn 
Has lifted the dark eyelash of the Night 
From off the rosy cheek of waking Day”; 
or in such lines as Lowell’s— 
“ The rich buttercup 
Its tiny polished urn holds up, 
Filled with ripe summer to the edge.” 
And if they do not feel the beauty of such passages, what 
can we do? It will certainly be of little avail to try to 
describe and explain—even if it admitted of explanation 
—wherein the beauty lies. He who is wise will change 
the subject. But with children it is our duty to foster 
their appreciation. And fortunately there are few children 
in whom there are no germs of appreciation which may 
be so fostered. In most cases the absence of receptive 
imagination in grown-up people is due to the fact that in 
them the germs have never been cultivated, or the young 
shoots of imaginative appreciation have died down and 
withered in the sterile soil of their daily life. But the 
 
-P-A-G-E-257
  THE ASTHETIC APPEAL 243 
ministry of the teacher is here peculiarly difficult; for 
what the child is capable of appreciating is often very 
different from what the teacher himself appreciates. 
Certain it is, however, that if the teacher have never 
cultivated his own faculty of appreciation, he will be little 
able to render efficient service to his pupils in this respect. 
Hence his aim should be so to establish a mental attitude 
of appreciation in himself that he may be able insensibly 
to influence in a similar manner the minds of those who 
are committed to his care. 
Fortunately children are by nature imaginative beings. 
They revel in stories, fairy tales and such dramatic 
episodes as fall within the range of their apprehension 
and comprehension, and can be emotionally interpreted. 
Since they are near the perceptual level of mental 
development, they are chiefly interested in concrete 
situations and the stir of active behaviour. Simple 
and direct motives are within the range of their dawning 
comprehension. And they are quite capable of appreciat- 
ing a well-told story or an effectively developed fairy tale, 
though they may be quite unable to state the grounds 
of their appreciation. We often hear it said that they are 
rather severe and exacting critics. 
But in saying that children are imaginative, apprecia- 
tive, and critical, we are using these terms with a.some- 
what vague connotation. Their significance varies with 
the context. 
The broadest definition of “imagination” would be 
any form of mental process involving images or imagery 
in the product. When the song of a lark, heard over- 
head, leads one to picture the bird fluttering and soaring, 
it is a case of imagination. It is here, however, little 
more than a re-presentative reproduction of what has on 
some previous occasions been presented to experience, and
-P-A-G-E-258
  
244 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
is due to suggestion dependent on foregoing association. 
We must, no doubt, remember that re-presentation is 
seldom the exact copy of presentation in all its details; 
still it is substantially similar. But with increasing 
complexity of experience there occurs more or less dis- 
sociation and recombination of the factors. “This is fa- 
miliar in reverie and in dreams. New products may thus 
arise, and imagination is raised to a higher level. The 
process is, however, rather spontaneous than volitional: it 
may arise within the perceptual stage of development. Of 
this kind are many of the imaginative products of chil- 
dren. They are characterised by the relative absence of 
purpose or end; or rather let us say such purpose as 
there is, is in and for itself, self-sufficing, and is not 
subservient to some higher synthesis or ideal construction. 
That is distinctive of imagination when it comes to the 
maturity of its powers. It is then termed creative 
imagination. It may be inventive when the purpose lies 
within the universe of practical utility; or scientific 
when the universe is that of systematic knowledge and 
interpretation; or artistic when it is that of esthetic 
appreciation. These classes are indeed by no means 
mutually exclusive; still in each case the “ universe” 
imposes certain restrictions. The successful inventor 
imagines a combination of mechanical contrivances that 
will work; the man of science calls in the aid of imagina- 
tion in the framing of hypotheses which may be sub- 
mitted to the crucial test; if the imaginative products of 
the artist are not consistent within the universe of his 
creation, they stand condemned. Only fancy can afford 
to laugh at the restrictions imposed on her more serious 
sister, imagination. Creative imagination at its highest 
and best is a rare gift. It has given to the world much 
that is of priceless value. We do not very often meet 
 
-P-A-G-E-259
   THE ASTHETIC APPEAL 245 
with it in school or college life. Our function is rather 
to train the receptive imagination. This stands in the 
same relation to creative imagination that comprehension 
does to explanation. It is a form of esthetic assimilation. 
This we can do something to foster. 
The creative imagination of the poet is quite lost upon 
the reader or hearer who has no kindred receptivity. 
Hence the appreciation of imaginative literature pre- / 
supposes a faculty which shall go out to meet and embrace 
the creative product of the artist. People of little im- 
agination regard the similes and metaphors of the poet as™ 
far-fetched and extravagant. Why should Tennyson 
speak of the “dark eyelash” of the night, or the “rosy 
cheek” of morn? What could have induced Lowell to 
call the flower of a buttercup an “urn,” and to say that 
it was filled with “ripe summer”? For the lack of imag- 
ination in many of us—especially men—education rather 
than nature is in large degree answerable. 
What, then, is the relation of imagination to conception? 
It is a somewhat subtle one. No one can be a great in- 
ventor, man of science, artist or man of letters, unless he 
have both. And the greatest is he who has both in due 
proportion. The products of conception are general and 
abstract: the products of imagination are concrete and 
particular. The function of imagination is therefore to 
give concrete embodiment to the generalised results of 
abstract and conceptual thought. The things and pro- 
cesses, the men and women of our daily experience afford 
the material from which, by analysis and synthesis, our 
conceptions of the world and of human life are sublimated 
in the process of thought. The imagination of the artist 
gives to these conceptions re-incarnation; and in sculpture, 
the Apollo Belvedere; in painting, the Sistine Madonna; in 
literature, Hamlet are presented. But between the cre- 
 
-P-A-G-E-260
  246 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
ative imagination of Shakespeare and the receptive 
imagination of an appreciative audience, Mr. Forbes Rob- 
ertson may stand as intermediary interpreter. 
As with imagination, so too with appreciation, there are 
stages of development. In a broad sense we may apply it 
to any affective state which affords pleasure or satisfaction. 
Thus a dog appreciates the warmth of the fire, a child 
the tinkle of a bell. But the little girl who appreciates a 
good fairy tale has probably reached a higher level. There 
has grown up in her mind a standard of excellence in such 
matters, and when she says the story is a good one, she 
expresses a judgment. She applies to her affective states 
cognitive methods of comparison. She has formed an 
ideal of what a fairy tale should be. In all probability she 
could not formulate the nature of her ideal or the grounds 
of her judgment. Few of us, who are not trained in the 
canons of literary criticism, can do so. Our judgments are 
like those of daily life in cognitive matters. There we are 
wont to accept statements if they fall on a very vaguely 
formulated curve of our experience or knowledge. We 
do not, as a rule, apply anything like a logical syllogism. 
So, here, the literary ideals that grow up in our minds 
form the basis of our common everyday judgments, but re- 
main for the most part quite undefined. If I say that the 
following lines of Mr. Rudyard Kipling’s Seal Lullaby are 
excellent in their kind, I express a literary judgment: 
“ Where billow meets billow, then soft be thy pillow, 
Oh, weary wee flippering, curl at thy ease! 
The storm shall not wake thee, nor shark overtake thee, 
Asleep in the arms of the slow-swinging seas!” 
I am not aware, however, of having formulated any 
generalisation of what the peculiar excellence of a seal 
lullaby should be; and I certainly am not prepared to
-P-A-G-E-261
   THE ASTHETIC APPEAL 247 
throw my conclusion into logical form. And this would 
seem to be characteristic of zsthetic judgments in general. 
It is true that we can formulate some few canons of 
esthetic criticism. But they do not go far to help us. 
And if someone asks me, “Why do you regard these 
lines of Rudyard Kipling’s as excellent in their kind?” 
I can say but little in reply. And I shall feel that this 
little is altogether inadequate. It is quite possible, more- 
over, that my own individual ideal may not coincide with 
what may be termed the social ideal—using this term for 
the ideal of those among us who from their refined and 
highly trained faculty of appreciation are best fitted to 
give an opinion in questions of literature. And this fact 
—that there is no absolute uniformity of ideal—serves 
further to illustrate the distinction between literary and ; 
logical judgments. “ 
Both logic and esthetics have for their aim the estab- 
lishment of formal canons of criticism. Each, in its ap- 
propriate field, is the afterthought to insight. We form 
our opinions in matters of fact and matters of taste. 
by no strict rules of procedure. But we may justify them 
at the bar of reason by such rules. That is the function 
of logic in the criticism of the intellectual appeal; 
and of esthetics in the criticism of the literary or other 
appeal in the realm of art. The first stage of apprecia- 
tion, then, is the direct experience of plan 
satisfaction; a second stage involves a judgment in ref- 
erence to a standard or ideal which does not go much 
further than a perception that the particular case reaches 
or falls short of the standard; and the third stage 
is that of critical appreciation in accordance with canons 
of art, which can be more or less definitely formulated. 
Those disciplines which are concerned with ideals are 
termed normative sciences; such as logic, which has ref-
-P-A-G-E-262
  248 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
erence to correct inference and reasoning; wsthetics, which 
has reference to beauty of thought or expression; and 
ethics, which deals with right conduct. 
Now we must remember that the affective part of a 
child’s nature is in no way separated off from his cognitive 
faculties. Appreciation cannot possibly be developed in- 
dependently of apprehension and comprehension. Lan- 
guage is an expression of experience and of thought, but 
also of emotional attitude. And with the child we begin 
by helping him to render the sentences, which he already 
understands, and by which he communicates with others, 
clear and accurately expressive. Analysis comes later. 
From the very first, in dealing with simple sentences, we 
should endeavour to quicken his sense of the music of 
speech, his feeling for melodious rhythm, and his appre- 
ciation of the harmony which results from the consonant 
accord between experience or thought or emotional mood, 
and its fitting expression. In due course this leads up 
to the esthetic discipline, which is gained through reading 
aloud and recitation. 
In our elementary education a good deal of stress is 
rightly laid on recitation. This affords material in and 
through which appreciation may be trained. But the 
mere getting by heart of the poetry which is recited is 
in educational value the least important part of reci- 
tation. At first, no doubt, the child must devote all his 
efforts to learning his piece by rote. But the true cri- 
terion of excellence in recitation is not merely that it 
should be word-perfect, but that it should show that the 
reciter has entered into the spirit of that which he re- 
cites. And he should be made clearly to understand that 
correct manner and method are certainly not less im- 
portant than correct matter. Here demonstration is of 
far more service than description. The teacher must
-P-A-G-E-263
THE ASTHETIC APPEAL 249 
himself be able so to recite or read as to show how the 
spirit of the piece may be brought out. At first the 
manner and method of the child will have little individ- 
uality; they are based, through imitation, on the manner 
and method of the teacher. But it is surprising how soon 
the individuality of the child makes itself felt; and such 
individuality should be encouraged so long as it does not 
run into mannerism. As the pupil thus becomes inde- 
pendent of the teacher, he is able more and more clearly 
to show the extent to which he appreciates that which 
he recites. 
To the recitation of poetry should be added practice in 
reading aloud, not only poetry of varied metre, but good 
literary prose. Thus fresh material will be supplied on 
which the developing faculty of appreciation may be 
exercised. The usual plan in many English secondary 
and public schools is to drop all recitation and reading 
of the literature of his own language just at the time 
when the boy’s appreciation is so far developed as to 
enable him to enter into the spirit of the work of the 
best masters. It is true that a play of Shakespeare or 
one of the “Idylls of the King,” or other set piece is 
prepared with the aid of copious notes; and an examina- 
tion is set which deals with text and notes. But from 
the nature of the case the examination paper deals with 
them almost entirely in their cognitive aspect. Look 
through such a paper, and what do you find? A series 
of questions set, apparently, with the object of ascertain- 
ing how much general information concerning the subject- 
matter of the piece, or suggested thereby, the boy remem- 
bers. All this is, no doubt, useful. But it is no test of 
literary appreciation—a matter which no examination 
paper can adequately gauge, and hence a matter too apt 
nowadays to be neglected.
-P-A-G-E-264
  250 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
“ Suppose,” says Mr. Crothers in his charming book, 
The Gentle Reader—“ suppose these lines from Paradise 
Lost to be taken for study: 
‘ Thick as autumnal leaves that strow the brooks 
In Vallombrosa, where th’ Etrurian shades, 
High over-arched embower, or scattered sedge 
Afloat, when with fierce winds Orion armed 
Hath vexed the Red Sea coast, whose waves o’erthrow 
Busiris and his Memphian chivalry.’ 
“What an opportunity this presents to the school- 
master! ‘Come, now,’ he cries with pedagogic glee, 
‘answer me a few questions. Where is Vallombrosa? 
What is the character of its autumnal foliage? Bound 
Etruria. What is sedge? Explain the myth of Orion. 
Point out the constellation on the map of the heavens. 
Where is the Red Sea? Who was Busiris? By what 
other name is he known? Who were the Memphian 
chivalry ?” 
“Here is material for exhaustive research in geography, 
ancient and modern, history, botany, astronomy, meteor- 
ology, chronology, and archeology. The industrious 
student may get almost as much information out of 
Paradise Lost as from one of those handy compilations 
of useful knowledge which are sold on the railway cars 
for twenty-five cents. As for the poetry of Milton, that 
is another matter.” 
The difficulty is, that with young folk in their pupilage 
we have to help them to comprehend as well as to 
appreciate. No doubt our system of examinations tends 
to make some of us lay too niuch stress on information. 
The important point to remember is that to impart 
knowledge is not the primary function of a poet or his 
interpreter.
-P-A-G-E-265
   THE ASTHETIC APPEAL 251 
It forms, however, no part of my present purpose either 
to criticise existing methods of education or to suggest 
practical reforms. I can but indicate what appears to me 
necessary for the training of faculty. The problem is: 
Given a faculty of appreciation, which answers on the 
part of the recipient to the creative faculty on the part 
of the literary artist, how are we to train it? By all 
means let us render assistance in the apprehension and 
comprehension of that which our author has written. In 
this we cannot be too thorough. But, after all, it is not 
herein that appreciation lies. Nor can we expect a boy 
to describe his appreciation; as well ask him to describe 
his appreciation of a fully ripe peach. But we may ex- 
pect him to give expression to that appreciation through 
the reading of selected passages from his author. And 
we may and should teach him so to use his faculty of 
speech as to reflect the beauty of the literature he appre- 
ciates. Thus only can he show us how far his receptive 
imagination answers to the creative imagination of the 
author he interprets. 
Literary form appeals primarily to the ear, and we 
should endeavour to cultivate a due sense and apprecia- 
tion of the melody of literature. Even when we read to 
ourselves, the element of sound is not absent, but accom- 
panies re-presentatively that which is presentatively given 
to the eye. In early days, before the invention of print- 
ing, the appeal of the poet was mainly to the ears of an 
audience; now it is more largely to a circle of readers. 
And since the eye can take in a more complex and longer 
sentence than the ear—since, too, the reader in his study 
can pause and go over a passage again if he have not 
caught its rhythm or its meaning—some modern poetry 
has become too complicated and involved for the ear to 
follow. Few, for example, could grasp on first hearing,
-P-A-G-E-266
252 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
or indeed on first reading, the following passage from 
“ Sordello ”:° 
“ While 
Crowd upon crowd rose on Sordello thus— 
(Crowds no way interfering to discuss, 
Much less dispute, life’s joys with one employed 
In envying them,—or, if they ought enjoyed, 
Where lingered something indefinable 
In every look and tone, the mirth as well 
As woe, that fixed at once his estimate 
Of the result, their good or bad estate)— 
Old memories returned with new effect.” 
Judged by the appeal to the ear, such a passage stands 
condemned. And, at anyrate for the purposes of educa- 
tion, the appeal to the ear is the surest criterion of excel- 
lence in literary form. The appeal to the ear, however, 
involves an appeal through the voice. Hence the great 
and, in secondary education, too little recognised import- 
ance of reading aloud. I revert to this because it is, in 
my judgment, of great value in the training of the faculty 
of appreciation, while it is also a delightful accomplish- 
ment. How few Englishmen of average education are 
capable of reading effectively a passage in prose or verse 
so as to bring out its rhythm and melody, its delicacy or 
its force. And though a man’s powers of elocution are 
not necessarily an index of his faculty of appreciation, yet 
this is the most expressive means at his command for 
showing his appreciation. If, too, there is any truth in 
what has before been urged, that language and thought 
develop hand in hand, we may fairly expect that apprecia- 
tion and its expression should so act and react upon each 
other as to facilitate the concurrent development of both. 
We cannot here consider at any length how the child 
should be trained to use aright his gift of speech for 
purposes of reading and recitation. As before noted, 
 
-P-A-G-E-267
  THE STHETIC APPEAL 253 
demonstration is here of far more value than description. 
The child must be shown—not told—how to read well. 
The articulation must be clear and distinct, free from 
provincialism and mannerism. Rate of utterance and 
emphasis must be duly graded. And the melody of in- 
tonation must subtly indicate a sense of harmony be- 
tween the thought and its expression. Sing-song in 
repetition or reading must be checked at all hazards. 
Unfortunately, much of the simple poetry for children 
lends itself all too readily to sing-song. Hence the pupil 
should be taught to read prose with due intonation. It 
is easier to read well good blank verse than the rhymed 
couplet. The pupil should also be taught to distinguish 
clearly between the rhythm and melody of poetry and 
that of prose, and should be led to feel that the difference 
lies a good deal deeper than the way in which the lines 
are written or printed. A prose author may consciously 
or unconsciously fall into the rhythm of poetry—a fault 
from which even Dickens is not free. Mr. Blackmore, for 
example, in Lorna Doone, writes: “ All that in my presence 
dwelt, all that in my heart was felt, was the maiden 
moving gently, and afraid to look at me.” This is not 
true prose melody, but the rhythm of verse. On the 
other hand, uniformity in the length of the lines does not 
constitute poetry, though some definite schematic sequence 
is almost, if not quite, essential. The American poet 
Walt Whitman shook himself almost entirely free of all 
the trammels of metre. Both in thought and expression 
much that he wrote has great beauty, but it is difficult to 
read aloud effectively. I may perhaps be allowed to quote 
one short piece: 
“Had I the choice to tally greatest bards, 
To limn their portraits, stately, beautiful, and emulate at will 
Homer with all his wars and warriors, Hector, Achilles, Ajax,
-P-A-G-E-268
  254 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
Or Shakespeare’s woe estranged Hamlet, Lear, Othello—Tenny- 
son’s fair ladies— 
Metre or wit the best, or choice conceit to wield in perfect rhyme, 
delight of singers; 
These, these, O sea, all these I’d gladly barter 
Would you the undulation of one wave its trick to me transfer, 
Or breathe one breath of yours upon my verse 
And leave its odour there.” 
Here, where he is most effective, in the last four lines, he 
departs least widely from the traditional poetic form. 
The pupil should always be allowed to read over care- 
fully to himself any passage he is expected to read aloud 
effectively. It is quite impossible for him fully to per- 
ceive the harmony between expression and thought as he 
reads at sight. Take, for example, the following five 
lines from a well-known sonnet of Wordsworth’s, which are 
admirable in their delicate harmony: 
“It is a beauteous evening, calm and free; 
The holy time is quiet as a Nun 
Breathless with adoration; the broad sun 
Is sinking down in its tranquility; 
The gentleness of heaven broods o’er the sea.”” 
It is not likely that the words “breathless with adora- 
tion,” or the last line, with its lingering emphasis on the 
word “broods,” will be rendered with due effect if the 
reader has no previous acquaintance with the poem. Nor 
can he catch the spirit of this introduction if he has no 
foreknowledge of the sequel. Reading at sight is indeed 
a most useful accomplishment, which should be separately 
trained. It involves in marked degree a division of at- 
tention between the comprehension of the matter and its 
effective rendering; for the comprehension of the meaning 
as we read at sight is some way ahead of the vocal expres- 
sion. But this very division of the attention prevents the
-P-A-G-E-269
THE ASTHETIC APPEAL 255 
expression from attaining anything like its maximum 
value. It may be useful, therefore, to be able to read a 
poem or a piece of music at sight; but it should be under- 
stood that this is no fair criterion either of appreciation 
or of powers of expression. What should we say of an 
artist who came forward to read or sing in public, and who 
gave us a mere at-sight rendering? But no artist worthy 
the name would willingly consent to do such gross injus- 
tice both to himself and to his audience. 
All this illustrates the need of preparation in the field 
of appreciation as in that of cognitive assimilation. As 
we have seen to be the case in all interest and attention, 
so also here, the relation of that which is in the focus 
of consciousness to the mental background in which it 
is set, forms an important factor in esthetic tone. This 
is well seen in the employment of that which is known as 
suspense. Here a series of minor relationships are pre- 
sented so as to prepare a background in which the em- 
phatic relation shall be set. An example from Macaulay’s 
Reform Bill speech may be taken in illustration: “If, 
sir, I wished to make such a foreigner clearly understand 
what I consider as the great defect of our system, I would 
conduct him through that immense city which lies to 
the north of Great Russell Street and Oxford Street— 
a city superior in size and in population to the capitals 
of many mighty kingdoms; and probably superior in opu- 
lence, intelligence, and general respectability to any city 
in the world. I would conduct him through that in- 
terminable succession of streets and squares, all consist- 
ing of well-built and well-furnished houses. I would 
make him observe the brilliancy of the shops, and the 
crowd of well-appointed equipages. I would show him 
that magnificent circle of palaces which surrounds the 
Regent’s Park. I would tell him that the rental of this 
 
-P-A-G-E-270
  
258 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
district was far greater than that of the whole kingdom 
of Scotland at the time of the Union. And then I would 
tell him that this was an unrepresented district.” Note 
how the background of consciousness is here prepared for 
the final emphatic statement. And note, in passing, how 
skilfully the author particularises and brings the picture 
home to the eye through his description. 
Nor is it only in the employment of the figure of sus- 
pense that the influence of the mental background, duly 
prepared, makes itself felt. We all know how some par- 
ticular line of a poem, or speech in a play, or scene in a 
novel fails to carry its due force if torn from its context. 
Its full weight and beauty is appreciated only when the 
mental background has been prepared by what has gone 
before. How much even Portia’s splendid outburst, 
beginning 
“The quality of mercy is not strained,” 
loses, if Shylock’s question, “On what compulsion? ” be 
not borne in mind. Or, to give but one further example, 
how tame and trite, taken by itself, is the line: 
“And never lifted up a single stone!” 
And yet, as the line stands in Wordsworth’s idyll 
Michael, it is, at anyrate to my appreciation, one of the 
most profoundly touching and pathetic lines in the whole 
range of our literature. Few who have entered into the 
spirit of the poem could read it aloud without a break in 
their voice. 
We have all probably felt the thinness, so to speak, 
of the earlier chapters of a novel, especially on first 
reading. There is as yet no mental background which 
in any way bears upon the facts which are described, 
and in which those facts can find their appropriate

THE ASSTHETIC APPEAL t 57 
setting. On the other hand, our fullest appreciation 
of a novel or drama is when we review it in memory. 
The series of events are seen foreshortened in remem- 
brance; the minor events retire into the dimmer back- 
ground; while the salient features of the development 
stand out clearly in their due relations, the perception of 
which is accompanied by the esthetic tone of appre- 
ciation. Thus, too, in a sister art, Mozart speaks of 
“seeing the whole of it” (a piece of music, even a long 
one) “at a single glance of my mind”; and adds: “'The 
best of all is the hearing of it all at once.” For the 
purpose of epoch in retrospect, it is important 
that there should be a single definite development to 
which minor series of events are subordinate. When 
there are several co-ordinate series, not duly related, 
the effect on the mind is confusing. We say that the 
novel is wanting in artistic unity. Silas Marner is an 
admirable example of such artistic’ unity; Thackeray’s 
Virginians being wanting in this respect. 
The subject-matter of literature is as varied as are 
human interests. In it are reflected all the aspects of 
external nature that appeal to us as human beings, all 
the phases of human life and endeavour, and all the yearn- 
ings and passions of the human soul. All that we 
see and know, all that we hope and believe, all that we 
fancy and imagine, are reflected in literature. It is 
quite impossible, therefore, to define literature as a whole 
by its subject-matter. Nor is this subject-matter in any 
way definitely marked off from that of science. Neither 
literature nor science can claim a monopoly of any 
group of natural phenomena. Man and nature afford 
subject-matter to both. And last century witnessed 
science, on the one hand, endeavouring with increasing 
success to justify the application of its canons to the  
-P-A-G-E-272
    
258 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
study of man, and literature, on the other hand, turning 
with increasing sympathy for inspiration to the realm 
of nature. It is not in their subject-matter, broadly 
considered, that literature and science differ, it is in their 
attitude and spirit and purpose. 
Now, since different men and women have different 
interests, and derive their pleasure from different sources, 
there are many kinds of literature. Nor is there one 
kind of literary excellence, but many. This is implied 
by the adjectives we use: sublime, majestic, grand; ten- 
der and pathetic; exciting, thrilling; humorous, witty, 
comic; and so forth. We do not, or should not, apply 
the epithets “ beautiful” and “ pretty ” to the same piece. 
And this implies a variety in our appreciation. The 
same kind of literature does not appeal in like degree 
to all of us, nor indeed in the same way to any one of 
us in his different moods. These facts must be steadily 
borne in mind by the teacher. He must remember 
that what appeals strongly to him at his stage of 
mental development may not appeal at all to his pupil, 
who is at an earlier stage. If he attempts in any way 
to force upon an immature mind an appreciation unsuit- 
able to its stage of development, he may either prejudice 
the pupil for life against that type of literature, or 
encourage a sham appreciation, than which nothing is 
unfortunately more common or more silly. What he 
has to do is to educate the appreciation, leading it on 
step by step in its upward development. He must re- 
member, too, that his aim is to minister to all-round 
mental development.. He should endeavour to cultivate 
an appreciation of literary excellence in all its phases. 
The majestic verse of Milton and of Wordsworth at his 
best; the polished excellence of Tennyson, and the con- 
centration and dramatic power of Browning; the broad
-P-A-G-E-273
         THE ASTHETIC APPEAL 
humanity of Shakespeare and of Scott; the humour 
and pathos which find such different expression in 
Thackeray and Dickens; the strength of George Eliot 
and the delicacy of Elizabeth Browning; the word- 
painting of Ruskin and Carlyle, the wit of Tom Hood 
and the delicate humour of Charles Lamb,—all these 
should have their chance of appealing to a mind that has 
had an all-round education in appreciation. And since 
we must distinguish between our lower and our higher 
interests; between the pleasures which are mean, trivial, 
or sordid, and those which are ennobling and appeal to 
what we feel to be the better side of our nature; so we 
should encourage our pupils to appreciate best that litera- 
ture which appeals to lasting and enduring interests, 
to those pleasures which are ours in virtue of our dis- 
tinctive humanity. 
Although it must not be pressed too far, we can 
scarcely avoid drawing a comparison between literature 
and science. The primary aim and object of science is 
to explain phenomena; its excellencies are accuracy, 
organisation, and rigid logical sequence. It might be 
described as a concatenation of “therefores.” On the 
other hand, the aim and object of literature is to evoke 
emotional tone, to appeal to our sense of the beautiful, 
the grand, the tender, the pathetic, the humorous. Its 
excellencies are melody, harmony, artistic unity, beauty 
of thought and expression. It is not a concatenation 
of “therefores,” but a sequence insensibly enchained by 
a delicate suggestiveness. It depends not so much on 
logic, though logic may be insensibly present, as on 
insight. The one is primarily cognitive and intellect- 
ual; the other concerns the emotional aspect of states 
of consciousness. But by this it is not meant that 
science is intellectual and literature merely emotional.
-P-A-G-E-274
  260 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
The best literature is often splendidly intellectual; the 
loftier scientific truths stir some of us with a profound 
emotion. The point is, that the primary aim of the man of 
science is intellectual and cognitive; while the primary 
aim of the man of letters is esthetic and emotional. The 
one interprets nature under the forms of the intellect; 
the other interprets nature under the forms of esthetic 
tone. The one strives to make his atmosphere perfectly 
clear and transparent; the other chooses the veiled tints 
of sunrise and sunset, the reflected lights of the clouds, 
or the half-revealing, half-concealing radiance of night. 
Not that the poet’s atmosphere is of necessity misty or 
vague; it may be so transparent that every minutest 
detail of his landscape is clearly visible. What could 
be more pellucid than the atmosphere of this little 
picture of Coleridge’s? 
“There is not wind enough to twirl 
The one red leaf, the last of its clan, 
That dances as often dance it can, 
Hanging so light, and hanging so high, 
On the topmost twig that looks up at the sky.” 
But whereas the man of science has no choice but to 
work under the conditions of the greatest possible 
intellectual lucidity, the man of letters is free to 
choose the conditions which conduce to the highest 
artistic effect. 
It is a mistake, however, to regard science and art 
as antithetical. The man of science is, or should be, an 
artist. His art-work is the interpretation of nature, in its 
widest sense, under the forms of the intellect; just as 
the art-work of the man of letters is the interpretation 
of nature under the forms of esthetic tone. Man of 
science and man of letters are both creative artists. It 
is not science and art that are antithetical; but the 
   
-P-A-G-E-275
       THE ASTHETIC APPEAL 261 
  art-work of science and the art-work of literature, appeal- 
ing as they do to different aspects of our mental nature. 
But if they are antithetical, they are not, or they need 
not be, antagonistic. No doubt a man may, by exclusive 
devotion either to literature or to science, starve down 
the other side of his nature and become lopsided. It 
is our aim in education to prevent such lopsidedness. 
And there is in modern times a danger—a real and 
very ominous danger—that the growth, not so much of 
science as of what we may term scientism (which may 
be defined as science minus the artistic ideal), may con- 
duce to the development of a specific class of lopsided 
scientists, All who have the interests of true education 
at heart should be alive to this danger. Technical in- 
struction is of great value; but it cannot afford that 
all-round training and discipline of the mental powers 
which is the aim of education. 
Although, however, there is no necessary antagonism 
between literature and science, it is undoubtedly true 
that, either through nature or nurture, the same indi- 
vidual is seldom man of science and man of letters in 
equal degree. Nor is it desirable that he should be. But 
the man of science should at least have some sympathy 
with literature, and the man of letters some appreciation 
of the art-work of science. And whether he is primarily 
scientific or primarily literary depends to a large extent 
on the nature of the mental background. In man, as a 
rational being, this background is in large degree rela- 
tional: in the man of science the aspect of the relations 
therein is primarily logical; while in the man of letters it 
is primarily esthetic. In the one it is illuminated by the 
cold, clear light of reason; in the other it is suffused 
with the many-hued tints of emotion. And there is this 
difference between the method of presentation of his work    
  
-P-A-G-E-276
   
   
                                  
        
    
    
    
          
          
      
    
        262 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
by the man of science and the man of letters—especially 
the poet. In an adequate treatise on science it is 
expected of the author to supply to a very large extent 
the background in which his conceptions are set. He has 
not only to give us his thought, but to exhibit with due 
diligence and care its relations, and its exact position in 
the scheme of knowledge. Not to do so is to fail in the 
art of scientific exposition. With the poet it is different. 
It is no part of his function to supply the mental back- 
ground. That you must bring for yourself to the study 
and enjoyment of his work. And the fuller and richer 
your background, the more sympathetically will you 
respond to the poet’s appeal. Hence the concentration 
and condensedness of poetry; hence the fact that it is 
suggestive rather than expository; and hence the fact 
that, if we have a poor thin background, Shakespeare, 
and those who sit nearest to his throne, will appeal to us 
in vain. 
To draw but one more distinction between poetry as 
the flower of literature, and science as the embodiment 
of rational explanation, we may note that, since the artist 
must ever breathe the spirit of his art into the materials 
with which he works, we find that, for the man of science, 
all nature is instinct with reason; while for the poet the 
whole universe “trembles with song.” As the poet from 
whom I borrow this expression—Mr. William Watson— 
sings it: 
“Lo, with the ancient 
\ Roots of man’s nature 
Twines the eternal 
Passion of Song. 
Ever Love fans it, 
Ever Life feeds it, 
Time cannot age it, 
Death cannot slay. 
            
-P-A-G-E-277
  THE ASTHETIC APPEAL 263 
Deep in the world-heart 
Stand its foundations, 
Tangled with all things, 
Twin-made with all. 
Nay, what is Nature’s 
Self, but an endless 
Strife towards music, 
Euphony, rhyme? 
Trees in their blooming, 
Tides in their flowing, 
Stars in their circling, 
Tremble with song. 
God on His throne is 
Eldest of poets; 
Unto His measures 
Moveth the whole.” 
I will add but one more remark on the relationship 
which we have been considering. It is this: that the 
teacher must never forget the cardinal fact—that observa- 
tion, accurate and sympathetic, true-eyed and true-hearted, 
is the mother alike of literature and of science, and that 
just in so far as we too are observers, shall we be able to 
appreciate the art-work of science and the art-work of 
literature. 
Since literature deals so largely with the emotional 
aspect of human life, it is in this field that the teacher 
desirous of making a psychological study of the emotions 
may seek his material. The emotional terms employed 
are very numerous, and each in its context carries wonder- 
fully subtle shades of meaning. The emotions are proverb- 
ially difficult to classify; and emotional terms torn from 
their context lose the living force they possess when they 
stand for vital, mental attitudes in the continuous action of 
a moving drama. I can only suggest some of the questions 
 
-P-A-G-E-278
   
   
   
       
   
    
   264 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
which may be asked. Does the subjective or the objective 
reference predominate? When we speak of a child as 
sulky it is the mental state of the child himself, as subject, 
to which we chiefly refer. But when we speak of a child 
as angry, we think also of some object of his anger. Is the 
objective reference to persons or to things? We may dis- 
like either persons or things, but contempt generally 
implies a personal object. Does the word refer to a tem- 
perament (the melancholy Jaques), or a mood (in a 
happy vein), or a passing experience (surprise)? Is the 
subjective reference pleasurable or painful or mixed? 
Can you classify the emotions on this basis alone? Is the 
time - reference implied, wholly present, or partly also 
future or past? Hope has prospective reference; forgive- 
ness and regret suggest retrospection; joy and uneasiness 
have little reference to past or future. Is the conative 
tendency active in some definite direction, as in anger; or 
restless and indefinite, as in anxiety; or quiescent, as in 
listlessness? Is it appetent, as in curiosity; or aversive, 
as in disgust? Is there an element of contrast with a 
preceding state, as in relief? And is the psychological 
level perceptual, as in the simpler forms of fear and anger ; 
or is it characteristically ideational, as in contrition and 
awe? To these and other such questions the answer is 
generally a definite one when, but only when, the context 
is given. 
One cannot but feel, however, that to use literature as a 
quarry for the extraction of psychological material is to 
detract from its pure enjoyment. After all, that is the 
titude of mind to which it should minister. And the 
aim of the teacher should always be to bring his pupils 
into living touch with literature, so that they may go forth 
and pluck its sweet flowers and fruits under no compul- 
sion and at leisure. “The first essential to the enjoyment 
 
-P-A-G-E-279
THE ESTHETIC APPEAL 265 
of poetry,” says Mr. Crothers, “is leisure. The demon 
Hurry is the tempter, and knowledge is the forbidden 
fruit in the poet’s paradise. To enjoy poetry, you must 
renounce not only your easily besetting sins, but your 
easily besetting virtues as well. You must not be indus- 
trious, or argumentative, or conscientious, or strenuous. 
I do not mean that you must be a person of unlimited 
leisure and without visible means of support. I have 
known some very conscientious students of literature 
who, when off duty, found time to enjoy poetry. I 
mean that if you have only half an hour for poetry, 
for that half-hour you must be in a leisurely frame of 
mind.” 
There is a subtle vein of paradox in Mr. Crothers which 
in itself is worthy of psychological study. It illustrates 
the distinction between the strictly esthetic appeal and 
that which is formally logical. And since his point of 
view differs from that of the pedagogue, I shall quote 
one or two more passages from the Gentle Reader, 
leaving the teacher to bring them into line with his own 
practice. 
“We usually accept poetry as mental discipline. It is 
as if the poet said, ‘Go to, now. I will produce a master- 
piece” Thereupon the conscientious reader answers, 
“Very well; I can stand it. I will apply myself with 
all diligence, that by means of it I may improve my 
mind.’ Who has not sometimes quailed before the long 
row of British poets in uniform binding, standing stiffly 
side by side, like so many British grenadiers on dress 
parade? Who has not felt his courage ooze away at the 
sight of those melancholy volumes labelled Complete 
Poetical Works? Poetical Remains they used to call them, 
and there is something funereal in their aspect. 
“The poets who delight us with their verses are not 
 
-P-A-G-E-280
  266 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
always serious-minded persons with an important thought 
to communicate. When I read 
“In Xanadu did Kublai Khan 
A stately pleasure-dome decree, 
I am not a bit wiser than I was before, but I am a 
great deal happier; although I have not the slightest idea 
where Xanadu was, and only the vaguest notion of 
Kublai Khan.” 
“There are poems whose charm lies in their illusive- 
ness. Fancy anyone trying to explain Rossetti’s ‘ Blessed 
Damozel.’? Yet when the mood is on us we see her as 
she leans 
‘From the gold bar of Heaven: 
Her eyes were deeper than the depth 
Of waters stilled at even; 
She had three lilies in her hand 
And the stars in her hair were seven.’ 
“We look over the mystic ramparts and are dimly 
conscious that 
‘The souls mounting up to God 
Went by her like thin flames.’ 
“This is not astronomy, nor theology, nor any of the 
things we know all about—it is only poetry.” 
“To understand poetry is a vain ambition. That which 
we fully understand is the part that is not poetry. It 
is that which passes our understanding which has the 
secret in itself. There is an incommunicable grace that 
defies all attempts at analysis. Poetry is like music; it 
is fitted not to define an idea or to describe a fact, but to 
voice a mood, The mood may be the mood of a very 
simple person,—the mood of a shepherd watching his 
flocks, or of a peasant in the fields; or, on the other hand,
-P-A-G-E-281
  
THE ASTHETIC APPEAL 267 
it may be the mood of a philosopher whose mind has been 
engrossed with the most subtle problems of existence. 
But in each case the mood, by some suggestion, must be 
communicated to us. Thoughts and facts must be trans- 
figured; they must come to us as through some finer 
medium. 
“This is the characteristic of the poet’s power. He 
does not construct a work of the imagination—he makes 
our imaginations do that. That is why the fine passages 
of elaborate description in verse are usually failures. 
The verse-maker describes accurately and at length. The 
poet speaks a word, and, Presto! change! We are trans- 
ported into a new land, and our eyes are ‘ baptized into 
the grace and privilege of seeing.’ Many have taken in 
hand to write descriptions of Spring; and some few 
painstaking persons have nerved themselves to read 
what has been written. I turn to the prologue of the 
Canterbury Tales; it is not about Spring, it is 
Spring, and I am among those who long to go upon a 
pilgrimage.” 
“ As there are poems which are not meant to be under- 
stood, so there are poems that are not meant to be 
read; that is, to be read through. There is Keats’s 
‘Endymion,’ for instance. I have never been able to get 
on with it. Yet it is delightful—that is the reason why 
I do not care to get on with it. Wherever I begin, I feel 
that I might as well stay where I am. It is a sweet wilder- 
ness into which the reader is introduced. 
‘Paths there were many 
Winding through palmy fern and rushes fenny 
And ivy banks; all leading pleasantly 
To a wide lawn.’ 
We are brought into the very midst of this pleasantness. 
Deep in the wood we see fair faces and garments
-P-A-G-E-282
  268 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
white. We see the shepherds coming to the woodland 
altar. 
‘A crowd of shepherds with as sunburnt looks 
As may be read of in Arcadian books.’ 
We see the venerable priest pouring out the sweet-scented 
wine, and then we see the young Endymion himself. 
‘He seemed 
To common lookers-on like one who dreamed 
Of idleness in groves Elysian.’ 
What happened next? What did Endymion do? 
Really I do not know. It is so much pleasanter, at 
this point, to close the book and dream of ‘idleness in 
groves Elysian.” The chances are that when one turns to 
the poem again he will not begin where he left off, but 
at the beginning, and read as if he had never read it 
before, or rather, with more enjoyment because he has 
read it so many times; : 
‘A thing of beauty is a joy for ever: 
Its loveliness increases; it will never 
Pass into nothingness; but still will keep 
A bower quiet for us, and a sleep 
Full of sweet dreams, and health, and quiet breathing.’ ” 
 
-P-A-G-E-283
  CHAPTER X 
CHARACTER AND CONDUCT 
To the question: What is the aim and object of the 
ministry of the teacher? many answers are given. At 
the outset I said that one of the definitions of education 
is that it should afford a means of bringing the individual 
into vital touch with his environment. The child of to- 
day is the man of a future day in the making. We 
contribute in some degree to his making; but to the 
making of what sort of man? He should have practical 
experience of nature, of human folk, and of social 
products; his physical powers should be developed to 
the limit of their capacity, and his body maintained in 
a healthy condition ; he should be skilful in manipulation ; 
his intellectual faculties should be so exercised that he 
shall attain to, and shall be able to apply, systematic 
knowledge; his gift of appreciation of the beautiful in 
nature and in art should be cultivated; he should be 
fitted to play some special part in the community, and 
to perform wisely and wefl the general duties of citizen- 
ship. The list might be expanded into a volume entitled 
“The Ideal Man,” or it eueny be contracted into the title 
of that volume. 
Common to all definitions of education, however narrow 
or however broad, is the setting forth of some ideal to be 
striven for and, if it may be, attained. It is implied in all 
269
-P-A-G-E-284
  270 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
definitions, that education should be a preparation for 
life, that is for right-living, which again indicates an 
ideal. From the point of view of this chapter the purpose 
of education is the development of character and conduct; 
but it must be the type of character and conduct of which 
we approve. And to reach this educational end certain 
educational means must be employed. But they must be 
the best means which we can devise; and directly we speak 
of the best means we are again in presence of an ideal. If 
we say that education should afford the best means of 
producing the best citizens we have a formula which, 
while it emphasises the ideal, is so vague as to be of 
little practical service. We must descend to detail. We 
must set forth this or that means for attaining this or that 
result as contributory to the end in view. We must 
analyse both our end and our means into its con- 
stituent factors. But no matter how minute our analysis, 
it is always an ideal means to an ideal end which we 
seek to disclose, 
Now we must be quite clear as to what is meant by an 
ideal. There are some people who grow restive the 
moment the word is mentioned. They think that something 
unpractical, Utopian, and up in the clouds is intended; 
at anyrate, something abstract and out of touch with con- 
erete problems and business-like procedure. No doubt 
in a sense the ideal is abstract; but only in the sense 
that every general idea, every concept, and all knowledge 
is abstract. But it is not necessarily, and indeed never 
should be, out of touch with concrete problems; and so 
far from being unpractical (if by this is meant divorced 
from active endeavour), that is just what an ideal is not. 
For that which we have in view is an ideal of what will 
conduce to educational progress, and this always is and 
must be some form of active endeavour. We have to 
 
-P-A-G-E-285
  CHARACTER AND CONDUCT 271 
remember that all knowledge involves ideal construction ; 
the adjective “ideal” here signifies that general and 
abstract ideas are the bricks with which the intellectual 
edifice is built. But the value of knowledge lies in its 
application to particular problems. An ideal of conduct 
is likewise something which we construct; as an intel- 
lectual edifice it is built of similar bricks. The conative 
aspect is, however, characteristically prominent. It is not 
only an ideal of conduct, but emphatically an ideal of 
conduct. One of the distinctive implications is that it 
contains within it a motive for action. This serves to 
link it closely with practice. The most effective ideals are 
those which are just ahead of what has been realised in 
practice, which may be realised by active endeavour, and 
the realisation of which is accompanied by the affective 
tone of satisfaction. Here then, as well as elsewhere, the 
aspects of knowing, feeling, and doing are combined. 
Through cognition the ideal is fashioned, through feeling 
comes the desire for its attainment, through conation and 
the exercise of volitional process the end in view is reached. 
And it is clear that, in ideals of conduct, the conative 
aspect, which implies a striving to convert the ideal into 
accomplished fact, is especially emphatic. 
The sphere of conduct is that of the field of intercourse. 
What we understand by conduct is some form of human 
activity carried out in the midst of social relationships 
and guided directly or indirectly by volitional process or 
the exercise of the will. The first thing we have to 
realise is the importance of the social factor. It is, of 
course, sufficiently obvious that those varied forms of 
conduct, which are distinctive of the work of the teacher, 
are a mode of social service carried on within the body 
corporate. From this service we may take an illustra- 
tion of what is technically termed differentiation and 
 
-P-A-G-E-286
    
272 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
integration. The teacher’s calling requires special training. 
It is a differentiated product of social evolution. In the 
process of civilisation he has been set aside to perform cer- 
tain functions which involve specific modes of conduct. 
Thus he has been differentiated from the professional men, 
tradesmen, or artisans whose sons and daughters he 
educates. But to enable him to carry on his work, their 
children must come to his school. The performance of 
his functions depends upon his standing in certain re- 
lations to the boys and, directly or indirectly, to their 
parents. He must establish, or there must be established 
for him, a connection. His differentiation from other 
members of the body politic involves the integration im- 
plied in such a connection; and the differentiation of his 
own specific modes of conduct involves their integration 
in close relationship with other specific modes of conduct. 
All conduct is subject to the law of social relativity; 
it is what it is not only in and for itself, but in relation 
to other modes of conduct; and it is this relationship 
which determines not only its nature, but more especially 
its value or worth for some end or purpose. 
Hence the study of conduct involves the process of 
comparison.\ First we take the data of conduct as given 
in particular cases of actual behaviour. We analyse, 
compare, and then synthetically rebuild in an ideal con- 
struction. This affords a conceptual scheme of social 
conduct. We then compare the particular case and its re- 
lationships with an analogous case within the ideal scheme, 
and express a judgment of its accord or lack of accord. 
The case may be one of our own actual conduct or that of 
another. So far we have only the cognitional aspect. The 
affective aspect is a desire to bring the actual conduct into 
accord with the scheme of ideal construction. The conative 
aspect is the active endeavour to reach the desired result. 
 
-P-A-G-E-287
  
CHARACTER AND CONDUCT 273 
We have already seen that it is through comparisom 
that general and abstract ideas are reached. We have 
now to lay special stress on the rédle which is played by 
what may be termed social comparisons. From first to 
last our ideas and concepts, all the products of our 
thought in ideal construction, are constantly compared 
with the similar products of others, or what we believe 
to be such. We utilise the integrating factor of imita- 
tion in order that we may bring the child or older pupil 
into line with, and close relationship to, social modes of 
thinking; in our efforts to foster originality and in- 
dividuality we render fully conscious and purposeful the 
tendency to differentiating self-assertion in opposition to 
others. But the comparisons involved deal not only with 
the products of thought; they deal also with the process 
of thinking. This is a point of considerable importance 
and requires emphasis. It is part of our inherent self- 
assertion that we are all desirous of persuading others 
to accept and adopt our own conclusions in any matter 
which really interests us. But to do so we must pay 
attention to the process by which we have reached the 
conclusion in order that we may induce others to follow a 
like procedure, and thus to embrace a like opinion. The 
teacher, for example, must realise how he passed from a 
given starting-point through certain stages to a definite 
conclusion, if he would lead others along a like track to a 
similar goal. And he must help his pupils to realise the 
nature of their own mental processes. One result of these 
inevitable comparisons is, that every step in the oft- 
repeated and long-continued process renders clearer the 
conception of sel*, and renders clearer also the conception 
of other selves. 
The matter may be presented in another way. We 
have seen that judgment is the acceptance or rejection of
-P-A-G-E-288

a proposition (or that which may be expressed in a prop- 
osition) as a constituent part of reality within a given 
universe of thought or of discourse. But all day long we 
are constantly comparing such judgments with those which 
are formed by others. Only thus do they attain social 
validity in the field of intercourse. Educational procedure 
is full of such comparisons. The pupil’s judgments have 
to be brought into accord with the judgments of others. 
But he must realise the nature of both and the differences 
between them before this is possible. Difficulties arise; 
and every difficulty involves a perception of dissimilarity 
between his own results and those of others. To overcome 
it is to bring process and product into social harmony. 
To grasp the nature of one’s own difficulties and those of 
others involves comparison, involves attention to mental 
process so as to discover the exact point where the diffi- 
culty lies, and therefore involves a better understanding of 
the similarities and differences between self and other self. 
If, then, judgment implies acceptance in the name of 
reality, there is always the further implication that it is a 
reality which others share or may be induced to share. 
It is a reality with social reference. 
But there is yet another group- of comparisons which 
arise in the sphere of intellectual development. I have 
alluded to difficulties. Few teachers will question the 
assertion that the realisation of difficulties is essential to 
progress. How impotent we feel in the presence of dull 
pupils who never have any difficulties—which of course 
means that they fail to realise the presence of difficulties 
in the mental smudge, which, what ought to be a problem, 
presents to their mind’s eye! In our despair we are 
almost tempted to say that this is a hopeless type of boy. 
Another well-nigh hopeless type is not unfamiliar. There 
are those who, while they can to some extent see a
-P-A-G-E-289
    CHARACTER AND CONDUCT 275 
difficulty,—for whom, indeed, it may assume undue pro- 
portions,—have little or no desire to overcome it. But 
fortunately there are also those who both realise the 
difficulty and are determined to overcome it. For this 
type there is abundance of hope. Now translate this 
into terms of self. A boy of this type feels that he is 
a bafiled self, at present beaten by some problem; he 
contrasts this with a victorious self by whom the problem 
has been solved. This is the self he hopes and really 
wants to be. He has had experience of the passage from 
a conquered to the conquering self. In other words, he 
has had opportunities for comparison of the one with the 
other. And this group of comparisons of the self at one 
time with the self at another time has a very important 
place in intellectual and, as we shall see, in moral develop- 
ment. But it involves the conception of an ideal self— 
that is to say, an ideal construction of the self one is 
not as yet, but hopes to become. And there must be a 
real desire that the baffled now-self shall be transformed 
into the victorious then-self of ideal construction. Even 
in these individual comparisons, however, the social factor 
is generally present. We know to how large an extent 
emulation, as arising out of a subtle interplay of the imita- 
tive and self-assertive tendencies, quickens the desire for 
success. If others are successful, all the more reason for 
me to join their number. If others fail, then still all the 
more reason that I should show that one of us at least can 
master the problem. 
We may now pass to matters of ethical conduct, bearing 
in mind, first, that they are forms of behaviour having 
social worth, and secondly, that they are closely related to 
the exercise of the will. 
It will be remembered that perception always involves 
active behaviour. The meaning of a situation for practical
-P-A-G-E-290
  276 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
experience comprises what has to be done in response to 
what the situation presents, and what further presentations 
will be the outcome of the behaviour. Within the field 
of intercourse, however, the situations involve social fac- 
tors; the child’s dealing with them is in relation to 
the manner in which others are acting in their midst. 
And the child’s behaviour is partly determined by his 
imitation of others, partly by his bias towards self- 
assertion in opposition to others. Which tendency pre- 
dominates will depend, as we say, upon the child’s 
character, and this in turn depends partly upon his 
hereditary proclivities and partly upon the circumstances 
of his life which have led to the repression of some and 
the free play of other inherited traits. 
In all matters of behaviour which rises to the level of 
conduct, comparisons of the type which I have above 
termed social, are continually being instituted in the most 
varied ways, and are of the utmost importance. Probably. 
in greater degree than any other comparison, they con- 
tribute to the realisation of the self in its likeness to and 
its contrast with other selves. The little child at an early 
stage of development behaves in this way or that without 
paying much attention either to his manner of behaving 
or to how his behaviour is regarded by his companions and- 
his elders. But not for long. His own acts as compared 
with those of others; how his own acts are regarded by 
others; how their conduct affects him and is estimated, 
soon form a fascinating group of subjects possessing a 
peculiar interest. He must attend to his own conduct 
in order to institute the necessary comparisons. He 
contrasts his own behaviour under different circumstances: 
that of his playmates and his parents or teachers in 
similar situations; what they think of him and what he 
thinks of them. As he thus becomes self-conscious, in the
-P-A-G-E-291
   CHARACTER AND CONDUCT 277 
more technical sense of the term, so does he also become 
self-conscious as the word is used in popular speech. He 
loses the spontaneous naiveté of relatively perceptual be- 
haviour, and is troubled by thoughts of what others are 
thinking of his conduct. He is apt to pose and fall into 
tricks of self-display, or to be shy and retiring lest he 
should make himself conspicuous. His tendency either 
towards imitation or towards self-assertion is evident to 
the careful observer; and it is emphasised by the fact that 
he realises that he is under observation. His conduct 
shows subtle accommodations in accordance with different 
circumstances in the field of intercourse. Among his 
chosen companions, beneath his parents’ or teacher’s eye, 
at a party where the majority are older than himself, 
with a “lot of kids” who are privileged to enjoy the 
patronage of his presence, he is not one and the same boy, 
but four quite distinguishable beings. 
Now the more we compare our own conduct at different 
times and under different circumstances, contrasting it 
with the conduct of others, and taking into considera- 
tion the way in which others regard it, the more material 
we have for estimating its value in relation to the purposes 
and motives by which human folk are actuated; and the 
more data do we possess for forming an estimate of its 
worth as contributing to the realisation of an ideal con- 
struction of social life, Such an estimate of any given 
action in its relation to an ideal of what ought to be done 
under the circumstances, involves a judgment of the 
ethical type. And the attitude assumed in such judgments 
is that of approbation or disapprobation. Here, too, there 
is generally a social supplement to our judgments. They 
are supported by their validity for others and for the 
community at large. Often they are supported by 
reference to some representative man who would, we 
 
-P-A-G-E-292
  278 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
believe, express such and such a judgment with all the 
weight of his authority. A soldier whom I met some 
time ago told me that when he was a young subaltern, 
and was getting slack, as he expressed it, he was pulled 
together by a pithy but effective remark of his superior 
officer. “Take care,’ he said; “you're forgetting 
Wellington, and the history and traditions of the army.” 
There’s many a lad who has been spurred to his best 
endeavour, and restrained from a mean or ignoble act, by 
the flashing across his mind of the name and figure of one 
of his heroes in history or in fiction. A man of science, 
who himself did good work in physics, told me that when- 
ever he scamped an experiment he saw the grave, 
reproving eyes of Faraday fixed upon him. 
It must be remembered, however, that the majority of us, 
in the midst of the busy work-a-day life of the world, would 
find it exceedingly difficult, if not impossible, to define 
our ideals of right conduct, to formulate the principles on 
which our indefinite ideals are based, or to render clearly 
explicit the grounds on which we express a judgment 
of approbation or disapprobation either on the conduct of 
others or with regard to our own acts. We are content 
for the most part to say that we feel this to be right 
and that to be wrong, or that conscience decides the matter 
for us—sometimes adding that the less we meddle with 
conscience and try to explain its origin the better. Just 
as there has grown up in us insensibly a standard, often 
vague but quite serviceable, of literary excellence, and just 
as we frequently can do little more than affirm that this 
poem or novel somehow, and for some cause, approaches to 
or falls short of what seems to us first-rate; so too there 
has grown up in us, also insensibly, a vague but helpful 
standard of right conduct, though we can often do little 
more than affirm that So-and-so’s conduct, we are quite
-P-A-G-E-293
ee CHARACTER AND CONDUCT 279 
sure, is morally wrong, or regretfully admit to ourselves 
that our own act on such and such an occasion was not 
irreproachable. 
The fact is, that the subtle influence of custom and 
authority has partly supplemented and partly been ac- 
cepted as a substitute for our own individual ideational 
process. Although we are constantly comparing and con- 
trasting, we do not carry out a systematic analysis, or 
recombine in a comprehensive ideal construction wherein 
the relationships of the several factors are clearly grasped, 
and can therefore be rendered definitely explicit. We are 
also largely under the influence of habit (of which more 
will be said presently), and do not pause to consider how 
the habit has been established. Indeed, we to a very large 
extent carry up into our life of behaviour and conduct the 
modes of procedure which are founded rather on percep- 
tual than on ideational process. 
Let us, however, consider the matter from the genetic 
point of view. It is part of our ideal that the pupil should, 
when he leaves school, be under the moral law. But what 
do we mean by being under the moral law? We express 
it otherwise when we say that he should act under a sense 
of moral obligation ; or again, when we say that his conduct 
should be guided by a sense of duty; or yet again, when 
we say that he should obey the dictates of conscience; or 
once more, when we say that he should act in accordance 
with his intuitions of right and wrong. All these ex- 
pressions imply that there should be established habits 
of right action, the performance of which is accompanied 
by moral satisfaction, and carry with it a sense of obliga- 
tion—this, too, from no external constraint, but “ wholly 
self-imposed.” How the sense of obligation arises, and 
what is meant by saying that it is self-imposed, we must 
now briefly consider. 
   
-P-A-G-E-294
  
280 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
From his earliest infancy the child is under subjection 
and authority. In numberless ways his behaviour is 
under external restraint. For long this is for him simply 
part of the unexplained nature of his environment. All 
his surroundings are acquiring meaning through percep- 
tual process, and this is part of the meaning. Parents or 
nurse check some activities, permit others; perhaps punish 
when this is done and in some way reward when that is 
done. Brothers and sisters exercise in a different way a 
like controlling influence. Although the child’s behaviour 
is thus moulded by the external constraint of others, there 
is at first probably no sense of obligation, as we generally 
understand the phrase, because the relation to others is as 
yet scarcely realised. Not only are his activities thwarted 
or permitted by other people, they are thwarted or per- 
mitted by everything around him—by hot things or sharp 
things which hurt, by cold things which make him shrink, 
by tables and chairs which bruise him, and so forth, He 
is constantly and restlessly behaving in this way or that 
in response to all that is presented to his dawning 
perception; some behaviour brings pain, other activi- 
ties are pleasant in their results. Only gradually are 
things and persons distinguished from each other. 
Only gradually is the constraining influence of the one 
group dimly realised as different from the constraining 
influence of the other. Only gradually does there arise 
in presence of parents or others a special sense of 
“mustness” begotten of their peculiar restraining in- 
fluence, felt to emanate from them as persons, and 
referred to them as its originating source. This is the 
germ of the feeling of obligation. It has its genesis 
within the field of intercourse; it is an essentially social 
factor in consciousness; and it inevitably involves an 
incipient awareness of how others regard the behaviour,
-P-A-G-E-295
CHARACTER AND CONDUCT 281 
for from them, as so regarding it, comes the “must” and 
the “must not.” 
But not only is he influenced by others, he is also both 
through imitation and in his self-assertion in some 
degree influencing them. As he gains a sense of “must” 
imposed by others on himself, so too does he gain a sense 
of “must” imposed by himself on others. He gets his 
own way (sometimes) and feels what it is like; more often, 
perhaps, he feels what it is like when others disregard his 
wants and his wishes. He experiences pleasure and sat- 
isfaction in the one case, pain and dissatisfaction in the 
other case. And he begins to project such pleasure and 
pain into the other self of parent or nurse, brother or 
sister. Affection quickens this sympathetic transference 
to and fro of all that he learns through self of others, and 
from others of self under the constant influence of the 
imitative and self-assertive tendencies. The “must” 
imposed by others is supplemented by an answering 
“must” from within. Herein are the germs of obligation 
as “self-imposed.” 
It must be remembered that in a sense all psychologi- 
cally guided behaviour is self-imposed. If the child 
learns by experience that, in presence of the nurse, 
certain behaviour is followed by petting, while certain 
other behaviour is followed by slapping, it is his own 
experience that guides; and his own experience is psy- 
chologically only another name for himself. All his in- 
telligent and perceptual behaviour is thus, in a sense, 
self-imposed. But when we speak of obligation as self- 
imposed we mean something more than this. We mean 
that it is in relation to a conception of self within an ideal 
construction of social conduct. Let us in illustration 
glance very briefly at the stages through which obedience 
may pass. The little child in the first instance learns to
-P-A-G-E-296
282 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
obey, as does the well-trained puppy or colt. To do this 
or to stop doing that is in accordance with a “must” 
from without, emphasised by consequences, There is no 
wish to obey. It is not yet willing obedience. As sym- 
pathy gains ground, however, obedience is raised to a 
higher plane. Mother’s distress at her child’s disobedience 
counts for something—counts for more and more. The 
external constraint is supplemented by an internal factor 
of a new order due to the sympathetic transference of 
another’s pain to the guiding experience. There is now a 
wish to obey, willingly and not from compulsion. It is 
the obedience of love and not of fear. The growth of this 
factor is educationally of the utmost importance. It 
marks the cheerful obedience of sonship through affec- 
tion, in contrast with the perhaps sullen and in any case 
wholly constrained obedience of the slave. But gradually 
a concept of self in relation to parents and others grows 
up. That self is among other things an obedient self. 
The wish to obey is no longer entirely dependent on 
giving others pleasure which is sympathetically shared 
(though that factor continues) ; it is also dependent on 
the ideal self, to realise which is an object of desire. It 
is the wish to obey, because to obey is what you wish; 
you must obey if you are to satisfy your desire to be 
obedient; it is a categorical imperative addressed by 
yourself to yourself. The sense of obligation is self- 
imposed, just in so far as it is in relation to a conception 
of a self set in the midst of certain social surroundings. 
If, then, we say that it is part of our ideal that the 
pupil, when he leaves school, should be under the moral 
law, we mean that conceptions of right conduct should be 
so identified with and made part of his nature that they 
will supply motives for conduct wholly irrespective of 
any other compulsion. The supremacy of the moral law,
-P-A-G-E-297
  CHARACTER AND CONDUCT 283 
the binding force of the categorical imperative, is the 
supremacy of the ideal construction over any partial and 
incomplete realisation in actual conduct, the binding 
force of a conception to which there attaches a genuine 
desire. The civil law of the land exacts a social minimum 
under certain penalties; the moral law, as self-imposed, 
exacts a social maximum in accordance with the ideal, 
under penalty of self-disapprobation speaking with the 
voice of conscience. 
By motives the will is stirred to action. But what are 
motives, and what is the will? 
Let us first try to reach clear conceptions as to the 
relation of impulse to motive. I suppose the distinction 
drawn in common speech is that motive involves delibera- 
tion, while impulsive action is spontaneous and swift, per- 
formed without careful weighing of the pros and cons. 
Such impulses may be good or bad when tried at the bar 
of ethical judgment. But whether good or bad their 
characteristic is that they are, as such, uncontrolled. A 
man walking by the waterside sees a child in peril of 
drowning, and instantly springs to the rescue; a high- 
spirited youth sees a girl insulted by a blackguard, and 
promptly knocks him down; a poor starving wretch sees 
a child carrying her father’s dinner, and hungrily grabs 
it. These actions call forth in different degree our praise 
or blame; but they are alike in being impulsive. They 
are not the outcome of deliberate control. We some- 
times speak, indeed, loosely of motives for such actions, 
saying that the poor wretch is impelled to his deed by 
motives of hunger. But it is well to reserve the term 
motives for the determinants of controlled action; and to 
speak, not of the motives, but of the promptings of 
impulse. 
It will conduce to clearness if we consider their relation
-P-A-G-E-298
  
284 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
from the genetic point of view. We come into the world 
with certain inherited tendencies to behave in certain 
ways. This gives us the initial instinctive responses to 
the appropriate presentations. Such performance, biolog- 
ical and physiological in its origin, being, as we assume, 
accompanied by consciousness, affords, together with the 
presentations, what I termed the primordial tissue of 
experience. But with the growth of perception, circum- 
stances are dealt with in accordance with the meaning 
they have acquired through previous experience. The 
tendency to behave in any situation in accordance with 
the pleasure or the pain which is the affective tone accom- 
panying its meaning for cognition, is that mode of con- 
sciousness which we may term a primary impulse. In 
intelligent behaviour, then, on the perceptual plane of 
mental development there is a primary impulse to com- 
plete that situation with which pleasurable affective tone 
has been in some way associated. This impulse arises 
within the conscious disposition to deal with the situation 
in and for itself. We must remember that perceptual 
process, as such, is limited to the immediate situation and 
the meaning it has acquired. It has as such nothing to 
do with the worth of the behaviour for more remote ends. 
But when, through much comparison of varied kinds of 
behaviour, an ideal construction of conduct directed to 
some purpose takes form in the mind, there are, in 
addition to the promptings of primary impulse to get 
pleasure out of the situation, motives involving the 
consideration of the bearings of the act on some more 
remote end. Their affective tone is a desire to attain 
that end; and the satisfaction of such a desire must out- 
weigh the pleasures or pains attaching to the situation 
in and for itself. If, when one of our pupils has cut 
himself severely, we have to bind up a serious and gaping
-P-A-G-E-299
  
CHARACTER AND CONDUCT 285 
wound, the sight of blood and the cruel gash may fill us 
with impulsive aversion to the task which we none the 
less perform, of our own free will, from no external com- 
pulsion, and in spite of the fact that all our affective 
feelings, arising out of the immediate situation, are 
acting as deterrents. We probably have to cause the 
child some pain, but we do so for the child’s future good, 
looking forward beyond the present situation. This is 
only a particular case by means of which to exemplify 
an extensive class of human acts in which we disregard 
the impulses of the moment; in which conduct leads us 
not along the ways of immediate and direct pleasure and 
ease, but through scenes fraught with many forms of 
discomfort, annoyance, sorrow, and sometimes patient 
suffering. In them we have passed beyond the perceptual 
stage of development, in which each situation is dealt 
with frankly in and for itself, and have reached the level 
of ideational process, of volitional acts, of rational and 
moral procedure, of conduct which betokens character. 
When a man, in spite of his aversion to an unpleasant 
task, tends an injured companion, we cannot explain his 
conduct without going beyond the immediate situation. 
We say that he is actuated by motives of humanity. A 
particular situation, the like of which may never have 
occurred before, is only the opportunity for the alleviation 
of suffering; only the occasion for putting in practice 
what has already been conceived as the fitting act the 
kind of man he desires to be would do under such 
circumstances. 
The essential feature of motive is that it is in relation 
to some purpose within a scheme of ideal construction. 
The primary impulses are characterised by appetence or 
aversion, tendencies towards the development of some 
situation or tendencies fromwards, as Hobbes phrased it.
-P-A-G-E-300
  286 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
Motives, too, are towards or fromwards. But there is 
an object of desire to which the development of the situ- 
ation is only contributory. From a slightly different 
point of view the primary impulses lead to the realisation 
of the perceptual self, while motives lead to the realisation 
of the ideal self. Within that ideal construction are a 
number of objects of desire, each of which is named by an 
abstract term—some personal, such as ambition and self- 
improvement; some having regard to others, such as 
humanity and pity; some having more general reference 
to the social concept, such as justice and honesty. The 
term “motive” requires as its completion one of these 
terms; we speak, for example, of motives of pity or of 
justice; or it requires an adjective of like conceptual 
implication, such as religious, prudential, political. Since, 
however, the ideal construction of social conduct is very 
complex and the objects of desire varied, there often arises 
a diversity of motives appealing to different aspects of 
the ideal self. Political expediency may suggest a line 
of conduct which may appear to involve some injustice. 
Motives of self-regard may conflict with those having re- 
gard to the good of others. 
A lack of consonance in motives, in presence of more 
impulsive tendencies, is familiar in the affairs of daily 
life. The desire to keep my body and brain in good 
working order may conflict with my desire to finish this 
chapter. Hygienic motives suggest a round of golf; 
motives of industry, and perhaps the lust of finishing, 
suggest sitting on at my writing-table. If I go out I shall 
probably work better and more rapidly on my return; 
but I may find other business awaiting me, and then I 
shall grumble at not having made any progress, The 
weighing of the pros and cons in such a case is deliberation. 
The result will probably depend upon which aspect of the
-P-A-G-E-301
  CHARACTER AND CONDUCT 287 
ideal self is uppermost—the self invigorated by exercise 
(with a pleasurable impulse thrown in) or the industrious 
self, just a little flat and stale. And generally some 
fresh consideration is suggested which makes one or other 
preponderate. If I happen to remember that it is a match 
day on the golf course, which will therefore be crowded, 
that may decide the matter; or if I remember that a 
friend asked me to call in, if I could get away, as he 
wanted, if he too could get away, to play with me, that 
may decide the matter. It would be selfish not to give 
him a game. When one aspect of the self already tends 
to preponderate we can often find an additional motive 
which may serve as an excuse to the other aspect and 
clench the decision. Suppose, then, that I start off, and 
having reached my friend’s house, am met with an apol- 
ogy; he is really very sorry; he had fully expected to be 
able to get away, but he has some literary work to finish, 
and he makes it a rule not to let golf come before the 
performance of duty. Of course I agree with him, though 
I may feel that my agreement is not quite in accord with 
my own action. Still, having started, I am not to be 
balked of my game; that would show weakness and in- 
decision. I will try and induce another friend to come 
out with me. But then, in some degree, and more 
insistently afterwards when I review the matter before 
my unfinished tale of work, the other aspect of myself 
comes uppermost and whispers: This unselfishness, then, 
was a palpable excuse; you really wanted to play, and 
did not care whether you neglected your work or not, so 
long as you did what was most pleasant. This silent 
admonition of the other aspect of the self is of the same 
order as what we call the voice of conscience. 
Although it may be present in the midst of action as 
a numb feeling of dissatisfaction rather implicit than
-P-A-G-E-302
288 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
explicit, it is generally in subsequent moments of retro- 
spection, when under different circumstances we reflect 
over our conduct, that the self-dissatisfaction of conscience 
passes into a definite judgment of self-disapprobation. 
The relative strength of impulses and motives is not what 
it was in the midst of action. Then a number of 
situational elements were pressing in their insistence, the 
claims of ideal conduct were in abeyance. Now the 
position is different. In our more rational moments of 
reflection it is the ideal construction of social and ethical 
conduct that is in the foreground of attention; the 
situational and impulsive factors before so insistent are 
now subordinate. Hence the now-self is different from 
the then-self, which is viewed with disapprobation, with 
regret for its minor errors, perhaps with remorse for its 
graver sins against the moral ideal. In our moments of 
reflection, too, the social aspect of the self is predominant. 
W. K. Clifford therefore spoke of conscience as self- 
judgment in the name of the community. All approbation 
and disapprobation, both of our own acts and those of 
others, have this implicit social support. And this we 
have seen to be the case with all social judgments. 
We must remember that correlative with the ideal self 
is the ideal community. They are indeed co-ordinate 
factors within a single ideal construction. The com- 
munity includes the self, and the self is a constituent 
part of the community. What we call the rights of the 
members of the community are just what we conceive 
they ought to have, and therefore may claim from others, 
in accordance with the ideal construction. What we call 
obligations are what we conceive they, in return, owe to 
the community, again within the ideal construction. 
Duties grow out of the reciprocal interaction of rights 
and obligations. Justice is the even balance between 
 
-P-A-G-E-303
  
CHARACTER AND CONDUCT 289 
them. Moral responsibility is accepted by each individual 
for himself and others in the name of the social self— 
that is to say, the self within the ideal construction im- 
plying the relationship of self to the community. It is 
thus in connection with the social maximum as ideally 
conceived, not the social minimum enforced by statutory 
penalties. Legal responsibility is imposed by the civil 
law of the realm, irrespective of individual acceptance. 
The school is a miniature community, of which the 
constituent members are the junior and senior boys or 
girls, and the hierarchy of masters or mistresses. As 
the boy passes up the school he should gain clear con- 
ceptions of what this community should be and what 
part he has to play within it. Rights and obligations 
within the school life, duties arising out of these, the 
due balance of justice, take form in a practical field of 
intercourse demanding many forms of conduct. Under 
rules of discipline what answers to legal responsibility 
is enforced; but in many subtle ways the teacher will 
minister to the growth of a sense of moral responsibility 
more exacting but self-imposed. Although, of course, it 
does not constitute for the boy his whole field of inter- 
course—for the home and its social surroundings are often 
of at least equal importance—still the school does in 
large degree represent for a while the State. Nothing is 
of more vital moment in a great school than the social 
standard of “good form ” that is developed therein. It is 
scarcely too much to say that the schoolboy’s conduct is 
more strongly influenced by a desire to conform to the 
school standard of usage and current opinion than by any 
other motive. For one who throws himself heartily into 
the school-life, the stigma of “bad form ” is something to 
be avoided at all hazards. And though the standard of 
“form” may alter as we go through life, yet the desire to
-P-A-G-E-304
  290 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
conform to social usage, and so to act as to win social 
approbation and to escape social disapprobation, is, it 
would seem, the predominant motive with the majority 
of us so long as it does not directly conflict with prudential 
self-interest. Happy the school, therefore, and happy 
the community which possesses a high standard of 
social usage and custom; which possesses, in a word, a 
high social ideal of what the community should be and 
should do. 
In the study of history splendid opportunities are 
afforded to the teacher of giving an indirect impetus to 
the development in the pupil’s mind both of the ideal self 
and of the ideal community. For history presents us 
with concrete examples of strenuous endeavour towards 
the realisation both of individual character and of a 
better social condition of the community at large. How- 
ever open it may be to criticism from the point of view 
of the scientific historian, there can be no question that 
hero-worship is of great importance in the development 
of the character of the worshipper. Hence it has been 
said: Tell me a man’s heroes, and I will read you his 
character. I have before said that one of the main points 
of value in history as a school subject, and even as a 
subject for our bigger schoolboys at the university, is that 
it widens the sympathies by extending representatively the 
field of intercourse. I would now add, that while it 
widens the sympathies it also affords concrete examples 
of conduct and picturesque material for an insensible and 
unobtrusive training in approbation and disapprobation. 
It also affords us the material for drawing the distinction, 
with reference to concrete examples, between merit and 
virtue. There are some types of character so happily 
constituted that we may say of them that there is no 
merit in their virtue. For merit is proportional to the

   CHARACTER AND CONDUCT 291 
struggle. And there’s many a schoolboy in whom self- 
mastery is not yet established, whose half-won goodness, 
under difficult circumstances, is more meritorious than the 
easy self-denial of one of maturer years, 
Literature, too, as well as history, affords concrete 
examples of conduct which should be utilised by the 
teacher in the same unobtrusive and insensible fashion, 
not moralising and preaching from the literary text, but 
stimulating, by his own enthusiasm for certain excellencies 
of character, a like enthusiasm in the minds of his pupils. 
In many cases the literary artist has had in view this 
wholesome influence on his readers in the creation of his 
characters. It is part of his aim to subtly indicate 
through the portrayal of character what is his own ideal 
self and what his ideal community. And it is one of the 
functions of the artist to lead us to see, through the 
delicate emphasis which characterises his synthesis, 
features which would otherwise have escaped our duller 
vision, As Browning says in his Fra Lippo Lippi: 
    “For, don’t you mark? we’re made so that we love 
First when we see them painted, things we have passed 
Perhaps a hundred times nor cared to see; 
And so they are better, painted—better to us, 
Which is the same thing. Art was given for that: 
God uses us to help each other so, 
Lending our minds out.” 
           
        
      What we have to do as teachers is to “lend our minds 
out ” to the best possible purpose. For we too are artists; 
and the materials with which we have to deal are human 
minds and their environment. 
We must now return to the distinction above drawn 
between the primary impulses which are the outcome of 
perceptual development and the motives which arise when 
an ideal construction of self and community has taken
-P-A-G-E-306
   
       
292 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
form in the mind. When this stage is reached ethical 
judgment is passed, in terms of approbation, rather on the 
motive for conduct than on the actual behaviour. An 
important part is, however, played by habit. We have 
seen that volitional conduct, that due to the exercise of 
the will, implies motives and often involves deliberation. 
A course of action is chosen because it will subserve a pur- 
pose and enable one to reach an end—that of develop- 
ing some aspect of the self. But if such a course is 
persisted in and repeated on similar grounds on many 
occasions, an ideational disposition so to act becomes 
better and better organised; deliberation is no longer 
necessary, effort ceases, volition lapses. Self-control has 
done its work. Tendencies so to act under such circum- 
stances have been firmly established. We do the right or 
expedient thing almost automatically. There is no longer 
any need, as there was at the outset of volitional conduct, 
to look beyond the immediate situation and to weigh the 
consequences. That was part of our earlier education in 
conduct, and now education has done its work.. Facilita- 
tion has rendered appropriate activities spontaneous, and 
habit hag begotten secondary impulses which take the 
place of the motives which are no longer necessary just 
because they have played their part in the organisation of 
well-established conduct. The course of progress there- 
fore is: first, the development of primary impulses of per- 
ceptual origin relatively isolated and attaching to the 
dispositions arising in connection with situations of 
frequent occurrence; later, the development of motives in 
relation to wider purposes, implying an increasing unity 
and continuity of conduct in view of an end to which 
diverse situations are contributory, and involving the 
conception of an ideal self which is the object of desire; 
and then, through habit and facilitation, and by the
-P-A-G-E-307
  CHARACTER AND CONDUCT 293 
lapsing of motive, the establishment of secondary impulses 
prompting to the spontaneous performance of conduct 
appropriate to the circumstances, without need of consid- 
eration or deliberation. 
The influence of the law of habit, through which 
volitional conduct becomes spontaneous and motives 
insensibly pass into secondary impulses, can scarcely be 
over-estimated. It lies at the very root of all training of 
character. Of all people in the world, teachers should re- 
member that in every act of our lives, no matter how 
trivial, we are laying the foundation of all our future 
conduct. Looking forward to the men and women his 
pupils are to become, he should bear in mind what Miss 
Edith Simcox wrote many years ago. “Does it seem,” 
she asks, “a trifling thing to say that in hours of pas- 
sionate trial or temptation a man can have no better 
help than his own past? very generous feeling that 
has not been crushed, every wholesome impulse that 
has been followed, every just perception, every habit of 
unselfish action, will be present in the background to 
guide and to restrain. It is too late when the storm has 
burst to provide our craft with rigging fit to weather it; 
but we may find a purpose for the years which oppress us 
by their dull calm, if we elect to spend them in laying up 
stores of strength and wisdom and emotional prejudices 
of a goodly human kind, whereby, if need arises, we may 
be able to resist hereafter the gusts of passion that might 
else bear us out of the straightforward chosen course.” 
But the influence of habit in the moulding of life is 
characteristic of the whole of mental development in 
knowledge, in esthetic appreciation, and, as we must 
now clearly grasp, in conduct. The growth of knowledge, 
for example, is dependent, as we have seen, on ideational 
process, through which the data of experience after analysis
-P-A-G-E-308
    
294 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
and comparison are brought into relationship and syn- 
thetically organised. It is only at the growing edge, how- 
ever, that organisation is in progress; it is here that 
synthesis occurs; it is here that ideational process is 
actually at work; it is here that intellectual dispositions 
are in course of formation; it is here that assimilation 
and incorporation take place. But behind the growing 
edge is the knowledge that has been already organised; 
there synthesis has occurred; there ideational process has 
done its work; there intellectual dispositions have been 
formed; there assimilation and incorporation have taken 
place. The knowledge already won forms the intellectual 
platform on which we stand while we reach forth in 
order that we may win the more. We should never 
make any progress if we had constantly to be rethinking 
our old thoughts, learning afresh what we had previously 
learnt, going over again all the processes of judgment, 
drawing anew every conclusion to which we have been 
led. That is unnecessary. We utilise again and again 
the results which have become so familiar that they 
come to mind spontaneously and without effort. <A 
continuously growing edge of systematic knowledge is 
only possible if what was gained in previous growth has 
passed into established habits of thought, leaving ideational 
process free to carry further the work of ideal con- 
struction. 
So is it also with conduct. The growth of conduct 
is dependent upon volitional process, through which our 
life activities are brought into relational harmony and 
organised. It is only at the growing edge, however, 
that organisation of conduct is in progress; it is here 
that volitional process is actually at work; it is here 
that moral and other dispositions to act in appropriate 
ways are in course of formation. But behind the growing 
 
-P-A-G-E-309
     CHARACTER AND CONDUCT 
edge is the conduct that has been organised; there 
volitional process has already done its work; there moral 
and other dispositions to act in appropriate ways have 
been formed. The conduct already established forms the 
conative platform on which we stand while we reach 
forth towards the further bettering of conduct. We 
utilise again and again the activities which have become 
so familiar that they have passed into the region of 
spontaneous performance. A continually growing edge of 
systematic conduct is only possible if what was gained 
in previous growth has passed into settled habits of action, 
leaving volitional process free to carry farther the work 
of organising our activities in accordance with the purposes 
of social life. 
One result of the organisation of ideational dispositions 
is that the process of judgment passes into an implicit 
stage and takes place spontaneously. The grounds of 
judgment cannot at once be rendered explicit. Such are 
the judgments which we attribute to “common sense”; 
such are those which we often speak of as intuitive. They 
are ideational in their character, but are the outcome 
rather of what has been ideationally organised than of 
what is being so established. Hence they seem inexplic- 
able, almost mysterious — their characteristic feature is 
their immediacy. They come, but how they come, and 
upon what experience they are based, we cannot say. 
In this they resemble our perceptions. They, too, are 
immediate. Only by careful psychological analysis can 
the basis in experience of the intuitions of sense-percep- 
tion be disclosed. The result of that analysis reveals a 
paradox. The perception seems to be independent of all 
previous experience, just because that experience is so full 
and rich and so completely organised. Well behind the 
growing edge it has passed into a settled and spon- 
    
-P-A-G-E-310
   
    
296 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
taneous habit of perceiving. So it is also with the 
intuitions of apperception—the ideational or intellectual 
intuitions. They, too, seem to be independent of all 
previous thought-experience, just because it has already 
been organised. Well behind the growing edge the data 
are sub-consciously dealt with, and issue as intuitive 
judgments, which it is then the function of logic to 
analyse and justify: logic is thus the after-thought of 
intuitive insight. In the field of conduct there are 
likewise intuitive judgments of approbation and disap- 
probation. They are really the outcome of all our moral 
training superimposed on all that has been established 
through perceptual process. They issue spontaneously 
from what has been engrained in the character and 
rendered sub-conscious through habit. Such intuitive, 
unanalysed judgments are whispered by the voice of 
conscience; it is the function of ethics to render explicit 
their nature, their mode of genesis, and their worth, 
within an ideal construction of conduct as moral. 
It is almost impossible to consider conduct and 
character in their relation to the will without touching, 
however briefly, on some philosophical questions which 
are inevitably suggested. We may lead up to them 
through a few words of resumé and some definition of 
terms. Activities that are the outcome of perceptual 
process constitute behaviour which is thus the generic 
term, including all such activities; the psychological 
antecedents and concomitants of perceptual behaviour, 
in their conative aspect, are the primary impulses. 
Conduct is social behaviour which is, or has been, 
rendered systematic by volitional process. What do we 
understand by the term “volitional process”? To this 
question we can only answer that it is applied to idea- 
tional process in its conative aspect. For it “the exercise   
-P-A-G-E-311
     CHARACTER AND CONDUCT 297 
of the will” is, for psychological treatment, an equivalent 
expression. If we ask what is the will? we can only 
reply that it is what is implied in all volitional process! 
The antecedents and concomitants of volitional conduct, 
in their conative aspect, are motives. Motives are 
present when the organisation of conduct is in progress; 
but when habits of action have been established motives 
are no longer explicit as such, and have passed into 
secondary impulses. Conduct then becomes spontaneous. 
Of character it is not easy to give a satisfactory definition. 
We know that each child, and every man or woman, has, 
partly through heredity, partly as the result of per- 
ceptual or ideational acquisition (including the effects of 
education), certain tendencies to act in this way or in 
that. The term tendencies is itself no doubt somewhat 
ambiguous ; but it is difficult to find another which is less 
so. It summarises all that we mean by saying that 
under given psychological conditions certain psychological 
activities, having appropriate expression in behaviour or 
conduct, do as a rule occur, and therefore may be ex- 
pected. The net result of all these tendencies, thus 
understood, which serve to differentiate the child or 
adult from other children or men and women, is the 
character of that individual. It is a complex whole 
peculiarly difficult of analysis. The most we can do is 
to select salient points for emphasis. But the outcome 
of this. complex net result of inherited and acquired 
tendencies is behaviour or conduct. The training of 
character is therefore the establishment of tendencies 
to that kind of conduct which we view with approbation. 
Here, again, we have a standard or ideal to the realisation 
of which our efforts are directed. 
But surely,—it will be said,—character is something 
“more than a group of tendencies; surely the will is not   
  
-P-A-G-E-312
  298 PSYCHOLOGY FOR TEACHERS 
merely a name for a particular kind of mental process. 
Is not character the spiritual reality of which conduct is 
the expression? Is not the will that which is the under- 
lying cause of volitional process? These questions open 
up large problems. It will be remembered that in the 
first chapter we had occasion to ask: What is the mind? 
No answer was then given save that the term “mind” 
stands for a very general and abstract conception. I 
then said: “Whatever the mind may be as an actually 
existent reality, comprising all our experience, all our 
knowledge, all our hopes and fears, all the impulses and 
motives which spur us to active endeavour, it is wider, 
fuller, richer than any given field of consciousness. Now, 
to such questions as: What is the mind? What is the 
character? What is the will? What is the self or ego? 
different answers are given in accordance with the 
universe of discourse within which they are asked. The 
universe of discourse in psychology is that of natural 
science. Asa branch of natural science it accepts the facts 
of experience, knowledge, and conduct; classifies them; 
tries to show their connections; endeavours to ascertain 
the laws or general rules of their sequence. It strives to 
elucidate and interpret the processes which are taking 
place. “Mind” is the generic term under which it 
classifies the whole series of psychological products and 
processes; “will” is that under which it groups the 
ideational processes in their conative aspect; “ character ” 
is that under which it places the established tendencies 
to specialised forms of activity; the “self” or “ego” is 
the generic term under which it classifies the whole field 
of subjective reference. It uses the term “ faculties ”— 
instinctive, intelligent, rational, esthetic, moral, and so 
forth—as group names, and with no further implication. 
But there is another universe of this course—that of 
 
-P-A-G-E-313
  CHARACTER AND CONDUCT 299 
metaphysical philosophy — within which these answers 
given by psychology are regarded as inadequate. Within 
that universe replies are given, or at least sought, to 
deeper questions. What is the mind which produces 
what the psychologist merely classifies; which unites and 
combines in serial order, and thus determines the sequence 
of states of consciousness; which is, in a word, the reality 
of which mental phenomena are the products? What is 
the will, not only as the set of conditions under which 
guidance takes place, but as that which really guides and 
controls? And in what sense is the will free? What is 
the character of which observable tendencies are only the 
signs by which its presence is indicated? What is the 
self as an abiding reality to which subjective reference is 
made? ‘To these questions no answer can here be given , 
or attempted. They lie beyond the confines of psychology. 
The teacher is almost certain to ask them. He will 
probably find somewhat crude answers ready to hand. 
For the discussion of these difficult problems, however, 
he must turn to works on philosophy. But it should 
be remembered that a psychologist who passes them by 
unanswered does not necessarily deny their importance. 
Nay, more, he is bound to recognise their existence as 
products of ideational process, though he is nowise bound 
to discuss the validity of the solutions which the 
philosopher may offer.

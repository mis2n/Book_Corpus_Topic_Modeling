  PREFACE 
This book has been prepared for use in normal-school classes 
and in teachers’ reading-circles, It is the outcome of some eight 
years’ experience by the author in the work of training teachers 
for service in the elementary schools—three years as a school 
superintendent and the rest as a teacher of professional subjects 
in a state normal school. It represents an attempt to make 
accessible to teachers the significant results of the recent scien- 
tific investigations of reading by Huey, Judd, Gray, and others 
and to present for the consideration of teachers a somewhat ex- 
plicit statement of the underlying principles, the aims, and the 
important outcomes of a course of study in reading for the 
various grades. 
The book represents, moreover, the point of view of the 
author with respect to the whole body of professional courses 
for teachers. He believes that the methods and devices of teach- 
ing a given subject are, in the main, purely personal and are 
the effective application by the individual teacher of the ideas 
he has secured of the guiding principles upon which work in 
the subject is based. He holds that the methods course in read- 
ing, for example, should help the student to form some ideas of 
his own of the nature of the reading process and of the various 
stages of its development among children in the grades, to the 
end that when he undertakes the task of teaching the subject 
he will be able to go to one or a dozen manuals or to observe 
the methods of one or a dozen teachers, and to secure from 
each specific suggestions without being overwhelmed by a mul- 
titude of devices because he has no plan of his own. There is 
the teacher who is skilled in the use of certain devices of in-

struction, but is unsuccessful because he does not have in mind 
a purpose in using them; and there is the teacher who knows 
what he wishes to do and why and when and how much. The 
latter can use a dozen manuals, or receive suggestions from a 
dozen teachers, and not be confused, or he can get along with 
the help of none, because with practice he can make his own 
devices. In accordance with this point of view the author has 
undertaken a statement of what instruction in the various phases 
of reading the teacher should give, why it should be given, 
when to give it, and how much to give. He has, therefore, 
knowingly run the risk of giving too few specific suggestions as 
to the methods and devices of instruction in order that he might 
not at any point be in danger of beclouding the main issue. 
His purpose in every chapter has been to help the teacher of 
reading to get an idea, not merely a device. 
Many a teacher who reads this book will no doubt be sur- 
prised when he notices the absence of the customary chapters 
on Reading Tests, Supplementary Reading, How to secure the 
Audience Situation in Oral Reading, Memorizing, and Teaching 
a Masterpiece of Literature. Although the author recognizes 
the importance of every one of these chapters, he has refrained 
from discussing them, because such discussions would lessen the 
emphasis he has wished to place upon the teaching of reading 
for meaning. He has considered it the wiser course to make the 
book somewhat exclusive in the treatment of one topic than to 
make it inclusive in the treatment of many related topics. 
The author’s point of view as expressed in this book has 
resulted from a number of influences, many of which it would 
be difficult to acknowledge. He is under special obligation to 
the following: to Superintendent W. W. Trent of Elkins, West 
Virginia, under whose supervision he taught his first school, for 
bringing for the first time to his attention the fact that prevail- 
ing methods of teaching reading are not always as successful as 
they might be; to the primary teachers under his supervision in 
Williamstown, West Virginia, especially Miss Pearl Gould and
-P-A-G-E-7

Miss Bethel Ingraham, for striking demonstrations in practice 
of superior methods of teaching beginners to read ; to Professor 
Charles H. Judd and others of his teachers in The University of 
Chicago for an interpretation through their class instruction and 
writings of the nature of the reading process and an explanation 
of its development ; and to his wife, Florence Bodey Wheat, for 
encouragement at every stage of the work, for many helpful sug- 
gestions which have ledto rearrangement of topics,and for much- 
needed assistance in reading the proofs. To his colleagues in the 
work of teacher-training in West Virginia, to Mr. J. F. Marsh, 
Secretary of the State Board of Education, and Professor Hunter 
Whiting of the Foreign Language Department of the Glenville 
State Normal School, who at various times read parts of the 
manuscript, and to Professor Walter Barnes of the English 
Department of the Fairmont State Normal School, who read 
the whole manuscript, the author is indebted for many valu- 
able suggestions which have been included in the text. Finally, 
from his students in Special Methods in the Glenville State 
Normal School, for whom the material in this book was organ- 
ized originally, the author has received many helpful ideas 
and illustrations. 
Grateful acknowledgment is due the authors and publishers of 
the various books and periodicals from which numerous quota- 
tions and figures have been taken. The author thanks especially 
the following for permission to quote from their publications:

READING 
PART I. INTRODUCTION 
CHAPTER I 
THE AIMS OF READING INSTRUCTION 
The first task that confronts the teacher who would under- 
take a study of principles and methods of teaching reading is 
the one_of determining the aims of reading instruction. The 
underlying principles of methods and the methods themselves 
must accord with the aims to be accomplished. If the aims are 
clear-cut and definite, principles and methods will tend to take 
shape in the teacher’s thinking and practice in forms that are 
clear-cut and definite; whereas, if the aims are vague and un- 
defined, principles will be obscure and methods will be wavering 
and inexact. A mistake in the aims reveals itself throughout 
the whole course of instruction; its results are wasted time and 
effort, for the teacher either accomplishes nothing or else that 
which is of little value. 
Mistaken aims are wasteful. The importance of a correct 
understanding on the part of the teacher of the aims of reading 
instruction can be illustrated by numerous observations of 
wasted efforts resulting from mistaken aims. The following 
are typical: 
Teacher A takes her first-grade pupils through numerous and 
varied phonic exercises and drills. Phonograms are sounded 
-

  2 THE TEACHING OF READING 
and learned from the first day of school. Her pupils become 
adepts in word-pronunciation, in word-sounding. Her pupils 
learn that reading is word-calling ; they seldom learn that read- 
ing is to secure meaning. 
Teacher B taught first-grade pupils in a rural school some 
years ago. Ability to spell the words in the reading books was 
the criterion of progress in his school. In order to win promo- 
tion to the second grade his pupils were required to learn the 
spelling of every word in McGuffey’s “First Reader.” 
Teacher C requires her second-grade and third-grade pupils 
to “learn the story” in their lessons through study at home. 
The time of the recitation period is consumed in discovering 
how well the pupils remember the story. The pupils learn the 
stories in their reading books well. Whether they learn them 
through their own efforts at reading or through hearing them 
read by their parents is a question that never seems to give the 
teacher the least disturbance. 
Teacher D requires his fourth-grade pupils to read and re- 
read a selection until they have mastered it. Every unusual. 
word, every allusion, every striking phrase, every turn of the 
story, is made the subject of closest scrutiny and analysis. The 
teacher prides himself on being “slow, but sure.” The reading 
of his pupils is intensive, not extensive. 
Teacher E is a stickler for expression. Her sixth-grade pupils 
engage in oral reading exclusively. When one pupil stands and 
reads, the others listen for mistakes in pronunciation and em- 
phasis. The pupil re-reads until he expresses the paragraph to 
the satisfaction of the teacher. 
Every one of the teachers just described is a conscientious 
teacher, striving very earnestly to teach reading. Each secures 
an abundance of results ; each is successful in accomplishing his 
aim of instruction. As teachers of reading they all are failures, 
for the reason that in each case the aim is wrong or only partly 
correct. Mistaken aims are wasteful of time and effort and 
public funds.
-P-A-G-E-13
  THE AIMS OF READING INSTRUCTION 3 
Aims in reading are variously interpreted. In the observa- 
tions that are related in the foregoing topic it is to be noted that 
of the several teachers described, each was dominated by a 
different aim of instruction. The fact that a variety of aims 
seems to prevail among teachers generally serves to impress the 
point that attention needs to be turned to the matter of deter- 
mining the aims that should direct the process of teaching 
children to read. The point receives added emphasis in the 
variety of interpretation which educational literature gives to 
the aims of reading instruction. The quotations that follow 
illustrate how great is this variety. 
The importance of oral reading as preparation for the study 
of literature is voiced as follows: 
Primary as it may sound, I cannot help emphasizing as the foundation 
of all study of literature the training of students in reading, pure and 
simple. 
The practical value of simple reading aloud seems to me to have 
been too often overlooked by teachers of literature. Teachers read to 
their pupils, and this is or should be of great importance ; but the thing 
of which I am now speaking is the reading of the students to the 
teacher and to the class. In the first place a student cannot read aloud 
without making evident the degree of his intelligent comprehension of 
what he is reading. He must show how much he understands and how 
he understands it.t ‘ 
Quite a variety of aims of reading instruction are proposed 
in the quotations which follow: 
In teaching reading there are ‘just two ends to be sought: (1) to 
make the learner automatic and quick in the recognition of word and 
letter forms and values; (2) to secure his interest in the content, the 
spiritual element, of the printed forms. Under the first is included the 
mechanics of reading—distinct and clear articulation and correct pro- 
nunciation, as well as skill in instant interpretation of words and letters. 
In the second is involved the character-growth of the learner, his intro-

pany, Boston, 1906.

  4 THE TEACHING OF READING 
duction to an enjoyment of truth, goodness, beauty, as seen by others 
and expressed by them in the world’s literature. 
The ultimate purpose in reading is to get thought and inspiration, 
knowledge and enthusiasm, help and pleasure, from the written or 
printed page—R. N. Roark? 
The function of reading is to interpret written and spoken words 
and to express their meaning to an audience. The first phrase—to 
interpret written and spoken words—refers to silent reading. Both 
phrases taken together describe oral reading. 
The standard of good reading lies in the ability of the reader to enter 
into the experience of the author and to make his audience enter into 
the same experience. Time, pitch, quality, and force are all secondary 
standards derived from this. With rural school children, teachers should 
be satisfied if the pupils understand what they read and read well enough 
to make the audience understand. The expression of deep or complex 
emotions, or of any emotion, should be incidental to the understanding 
of what is read—W. W. Cuarters? 
Paul Klapper assigns to reading three important outcomes, 
or elements : namely, (1) to extract thought ; (2) proper vocali- 
zation; and (3) literary appreciation. 
The foregoing quotations show that the aims of reading in- 
struction have been subjected to various interpretations. The 
need of a definite, properly formulated aim is emphasized at 
every point. The quotations illustrate also the almost hopeless 
muddle into which one’s aim in reading would resolve itself if 
such statements were considered with too great seriousness. 
The purpose of the chapter. The definition and character- 
istics of reading, Accordingly it becomes the purpose of the 
discussions of the present chapter to determine the aim of 
instruction in reading. In order to consider this purpose in 
somewhat definite terms it will be necessary for us to be more 
explicit in our statement of it. To this end let us examine the 
definition of reading and its possible characteristics.

  THE AIMS OF READING INSTRUCTION 5 
The word reading is derived from the Anglo-Saxon red, 
which meant “counsel,” and redan, which meant “to counsel, 
to advise.” To read originally meant-to, take counsel or to give 
advice. The double meaning was retained in its later develop- 
ment. Reading came to mean the double process of seeking 
counsel from writing and of passing on this counsel to others. 
We think today of reading as being the process of “getting 
meaning from the printed page” and of vocalizing, “in the 
words of the author, the thought that was gained.” Unless we 
think or speak specifically of silent reading, or “reading to one- 
self,” the latter definition, vocalizing, stands out in our minds 
with the greater prominence. When the word reading is men- 
tioned to us, we are apt to think of one reading aloud for the 
benefit of others. The idea of reading for meaning for one’s 
own benefit usually does not have so prominent a place in our 
consciousness. 
Two important characteristics of reading are thus stated in 
the definition. To these it is necessary to add a third; namely, 
speed. Speed is an important factor in reading. Too much 
speed is a hindrance to good expression; but if one is reading 
silently, speed may be increased so long as it does not interfere 
with getting the meaning. The characteristics of reading, then, 
may be stated as follows: (1) comprehension; (2) speed; and 
(3) vocalization, or expression. Comprehension and speed, 
taken together, apply especially to silent reading. Getting the 
meaning from the printed page in the shortest possible time 
may be considered as the purpose of silent reading. Vocaliza- 
tion, or expression, is the chief and only important characteris- 
tic of oral reading. 
In terms of the three characteristics named above, the proc- 
ess of reading and the outcomes of reading instruction may be 
thought of as (1) effective rapid silent reading and (2) expres- 
sive oral reading. Which of these outcomes is the important one 
and the one that reading instruction should aim to secure is the 
problem for the discussions of the present chapter to solve.
-P-A-G-E-16
    6 e THE TEACHING OF READING 
The needs of society should determine the aim of reading 
instruction. Let us examine our problem from the social point 
of view. Fully stated, this viewpoint takes form somewhat as 
follows: (1) Society, through its laws and its various adminis- 
trative officials and functions, requires and makes provision 
for a certain amount of reading instruction in the public schools. 
(2) Society insists that reading be taught in order to meet cer- 
tain definite social needs. Since society makes the necessary 
provisions that reading be taught, it has the right to make such 
a demand. (3) Therefore instruction in reading should be so 
organized—should so aim—as best to meet the needs of society. 
Considered from the social point of view our problem resolves 
itself into the questions: What are the needs of society with 
respect to the teaching of reading and the outcomes of reading 
instruction? Are these needs met by instruction in expressive 
oral reading or by instruction in effective rapid silent reading? 
In his chapter on “Selecting Subject Matter,’ Professor 
Parker gives the following answers to our questions: (1) the 
social needs of former days required the teaching of expressive 
oral reading; (2) the social needs of the present require the 
teaching of effective rapid silent reading. In order to emphasize 
the demands of present-day social conditions Parker depicts 
them in very sharp and striking contrast with the demands of 
the social conditions of the past. The contrast is evident in 
the following outline of his chief arguments:

  THE AIMS OF READING INSTRUCTION 7 
Our interest centers in the demands of present-day social 
conditions, but in order rightly to appreciate their force we 
should consider them in the light of the demands of the social 
conditions of former days. For the sake of contrast, then, let us 
examine the social needs of the past as they relate to instruction 
in reading. 
In the past reading material was very scarce. The outstand- 
ing social condition relative to reading of the days that are 
past was the extreme scarcity of reading material. Little read- 
ing was done, for the reason that there was but little to be read. 
In colonial days the total printed matter in many a home con- 
sisted of the family Bible, the almanac, and an occasional news- 
paper. In the schools the children had the opportunity to read 
as textbooks the hornbook and the “New England Primer”— 
nothing more. Of the lack of books in the schools and homes 
of the colonists Parker makes the following statement : 
There it was indicated [referring to a preceding chapter] that until 
1750 all the reading matter in most of the elementary schools consisted 
of the “New England Primer,” or some similar primer, and the Bible. 
In many of the poorer homes in the early colonial period the Bible was 
the only book for adult reading, supplemented in some homes by a few 
other religious books such as Wigglesworth’s “The Day of Doom, or a 
Poetical Description of the Great and Last Judgment with a Short 
Discourse on Eternity.” In a few favored homes a small “chest” of 
books constituted a treasured library.t 
The weekly newspaper added a negligible quantity to the 
total supply of reading material. The newspapers were few in 
number, they printed little news, and their combined weekly 
circulation at the opening of the Revolution barely reached 
five thousand copies. Their scarcity and general character are 
spoken of by Sparks as follows: 
Newspapers had not yet assumed importance as disseminators of 
news. When the Revolution broke out there were only thirty-seven 
1§. C. Parker, General Methods of Teaching in Elementary Schools, p. 86.
-P-A-G-E-18
  8 THE TEACHING OF READING 
newspapers in the American colonies, and no dailies. Massachusetts had 
seven, New York three, and Pennsylvania eight. They were not much 
larger than a large pamphlet page of the present day, and of four 
pages only. 
The latest news from Europe which the New York Weekly Post Boy 
of February 25, 1750, could find was just four months old, that from 
Charleston one month, Philadelphia one week, and from Boston three 
weeks old. The class of news illustrates the simple life of the people. 
From Charleston came nine lines on a “violent storm of wind.” Boston 
contributed sixteen lines on a “most violent storm. The Rain descended 
and the Floods came in a most shocking Manner.” From the same place 
appeared a story in four lines of a child falling into a cellar, four lines 
on a Captain Benjamin Blaney thrown from his horse, and eight lines 
on the drowning of two sailors. 
Paper was scarce and the printer was often puzzled to get his matter 
into condensed shape. To this scarcity of paper is due the variety of 
sizes and tints shown in a file of colonial papers. The margin was often 
used for advertisements, generally of slaves to be sold. 
Only a few were able to read. Another social condition of 
the past which exerted its influence on the character of reading 
instruction in the schools as well as on the kind of reading de- 
manded in the home was the prevalence of illiteracy among the 
people generally. We may secure an idea of the extent of illit- 
eracy among the people of colonial and Revolutionary days if 
we consider to what degree elementary education was neglected 
during that period. The following statements give evidence of 
this neglect : 
North Carolina was probably the most backward of all the colonies, 
but even here a few schools were established during the first two decades 
of the eighteenth century, chiefly through the efforts of the Anglican 
Church. The net results, however, were small, and in 1736 Governor 
Johnston reproached the assembly with having “never yet taken the 
least care to erect one school which deserves the name in this extended 
country.”

Foresman and Company, Chicago, 1900.
-P-A-G-E-19
  THE AIMS OF READING INSTRUCTION 9 
The results, however, in practice did not come up to the excellence 
of the laws, and while in some towns in both Massachusetts and Con- 
necticut a public rate was levied for education, more generally the par- 
ents had to pay the teachers, and they were hard to secure. When 
obtained they taught but two or three months during the year. Bad 
spelling and wretched writing were features of the age from which 
New England was not exempt. Real learning was confined, after all, 
to the ministers and the richer classes in the New England colonies, 
pretty much as in the mother country. In Plymouth and Rhode Island, 
where the hard conditions of life rendered any legal system of education 
impracticable, illiteracy was frequent.+ 
Professor Cubberley illustrates the wasteful character of 
colonial school training in the following statement: 
The greatest waste of time came from the individual methods of in- 
struction universally followed in teaching. Children came forward to 
the teacher’s desk and recited individually to the master or dame, and 
so wasteful was the process that children might attend school for years 
and get only a mere start in reading and writing. Hearing lessons, 
assigning new tasks, setting copies, making quill pens, dictating sums, 
and keeping order completely absorbed the teacher’s time.? 
When we consider that the schools of colonial days were 
exceedingly poor and that they provided training for only a 
small percentage of the population, we become impressed with 
the fact that the ability to read was the exception and not the 
rule. Only a few people were able to read, and, as it was pointed 
out in preceding paragraphs, reading material was very scarce. 
Let us now consider how slowly and infrequently reading 
material (written news) was communicated. 
Communication was very slow and infrequent. We may be 
enabled best to secure an idea of the slowness and infrequency

of the communication of written news by considering the hard- 
ships and difficulty of travel in colonial days and the conse- 
quent very inefficient postal service of the time. The hardships 
and difficulty of travel are discussed by Sparks in the following 
paragraphs : 
Travel by land or water was a hardship. When Benjamin Franklin 
ran away from his brother’s printing office in 1723, he was three days 
sailing in the sloop from Boston to New York. Between New York and 
Philadelphia the small boat in which he had taken passage to Amboy 
was caught in a squall and he was thirty hours without food and water. 
He next walked fifty miles to Burlington, and afterwards spent a night 
on the Delaware when rowing down to Philadelphia. Travelers with 
plenty of money fared little better. Packets sailed only at intervals 
between Boston and New York, New York and Philadelphia, and be- 
tween Philadelphia and Charleston. On some of the rivers, sailing vessels 
passed but twice per week. It required usually about six days to go from 
New York to Albany. 
Land travel was developed slowly since roads had to be made and 
ferries or fords provided. It was 133 years after the landing on 
Plymouth Rock before a stage ran regularly between New York and 
Philadelphia.* Z 
Of the inefficient postal service Sparks offers the following 
description : 
The printer’s office was a kind of colonial clearing house. Many of 
the advertisements closed with, “Inquire of the printer.” He had to 
circulate his papers and therefore was early identified with the carrying 
of mail and with the post office. A printer of Boston was also post- 
master as early as 1654, but the old practice of using travelers as post- 
boys for short distances and taverns as post offices continued a century 
later. In rural Virginia, where there were no printers, a mail bag was 
sent from plantation to plantation, each planter taking out his mail and 
being required by law to pass the bag to the next.? 
As deputy postmaster-general for America, Benjamin Frank- 
lin began in 1753 to carry into practice a number of radical im- 
1E, E. Sparks, The Expansion of the American People, p. 56. 
2 Ibid. pp. 63-64.
-P-A-G-E-21
  THE AIMS OF READING INSTRUCTION II 
provements in the postal service. He established postal routes, 
formed a regular system of officers and carriers, “originated the 
advertising of uncalled-for letters, straightened post roads, and 
increased the Philadelphia-New York mail to three times per 
week in summer and once per week in winter.” Yet with all 
these improvements the postal service was able to extend its 
benefits to only a fraction of the population. We read: 
Franklin continued to hold his office until the Revolution broke out, 
but even then the line of posts extended only from New Hampshire to 
Charleston, South Carolina, and in no place penetrated the interior of 
the continent one hundred miles. That vast region was as yet a sealed 
book.+ 
The foregoing statements are impressive of the fact that the 
very small amount of reading material which was published in 
the colonies did not have a very extended circulation. 
Spoken language was the chief means of communication. 
The natural consequence of the scarcity of reading material, of 
the slow and infrequent communication of news, and of the pre- 
vailing condition of illiteracy was that spoken language pre- 
vailed as the chief means of communication. The people of the 
time learned of the events of the day not through reading, but 
by word of mouth. Printed information was scarce, the little 
that was printed was very inadequately distributed, and when 
that little did reach the people it could not be read by 90 per 
cent of them. Travelers were welcomed in every corner of the 
land for the news they brought, and the demands imposed upon 
them for information by everyone they met are hardly believ- 
able in this day of newspapers and magazines.? The peopie 
were hungry for news, and as a consequence of the very poor 
reading facilities that existed spoken language attained such an 
importance as to exert an undue influence even down to the 
present. Oral discussion, elocution, and oratory were the chief 
language interests of the people.

  12 THE TEACHING OF READING 
The importance of oratory was emphasized by the prevailing 
democratic interest in public questions. The following quota- 
tion illustrates this emphasis: 
‘Yet there were many public questions in which the common people 
of the colonies were vitally interested and concerning which the leaders 
wanted decisive action. These questions centered in the struggle with 
England before the Revolution and in the political struggles between 
the various parties after the Revolution. Consequently oratory was 
depended upon to arouse and influence the people to an extent that it 
is difficult for us to appreciate today, unless we live in a part of the 
United States where the schools are very poor, newspapers and periodi- 
cals very scarce, and oratory, as a consequence, still flourishing. An 
exaggerated parallel to our colonial condition is found in the Russian 
revolutionary situation of 1917. In Russia there was the same intense 
interest in a democratic revolution as there was in America. Reading 
matter was equally scarce in the rural districts and the illiteracy prob- 
ably more general. In Russia, as a consequence of the illiteracy, the 
revolutionary government became largely an orgy of oratory. The illit- 
erate soldiers being unable and unaccustomed to read and to study out 
problems for themselves were easily swayed by the glowing promises of 
persuasive orators.t 
Expressive oral reading met the demands of past social con- 
ditions. The kind of reading that was taught in the schools of 
the past was expressive oral reading. Of necessity good ex- 
pression was the criterion. The prevailing interest in oral 
discussion, in elocution, in oratory, was reflected in the reading 
textbooks of the time. 
The prefaces of the readers during the first half of the nineteenth 
century vie with each other in proving that each offers superior training 
in enunciation, declamation, and elocution. Even as late as 1854 we 
find the following statement in a preface: 
As an accurate and distinct articulation forms the basis of good 
reading, it should receive our first attention in instruction, and be con- 
stantly taught until words are habitually delivered out from the lips as

beautiful coins newly issued from the mint, deeply and accurately im- 
pressed, perfectly finished, neatly struck by the proper organs, distinct, 
in due succession, and of due weight.t 
We can readily see how the common interest in oral expres- 
sion prevailed as the dominant note in reading instruction. 
Reading was looked upon as an important art for the passing on 
of information to others. When only one in ten could read, it 
was socially important that he engage in the process, not so 
much for the sake of getting meaning to satisfy his own private 
interests as for the sake of expressing the meaning orally to 
others. When a child was taught to read, he was impressed with 
the importance of reading so others would hear and understand. 
The child must learn to read for the benefit primarily of the 
multitude who possessed no skill in the art. The demands for 
expressive oral reading were all the more impressive for the 
reason that the very poor reading facilities imposed no require- 
ments for instruction in effective rapid silent reading. In the 
schools of the past expressive oral reading was very properly 
the aim of reading instruction. 
The social needs of the present are different. The foregoing 
discussion has made clear the relation between past social needs 
and instruction in expressive oral reading. The question that 
has been constantly before us is, Are the social needs of the 
present met by instruction in expressive oral reading or by in- 
struction in effective rapid silent reading? Our interest, accord- 
ingly, has not been concerned with the social needs of the past 
except as consideration of them serves to make vivid the con- 
trast with the social needs that prevail at the present time. 
Little needs to be added here in order to emphasize the fact 
that the social needs of the present, as they relate to reading, 
stand out in sharpest contrast with those of a former time. 
Whereas the social needs of colonial and Revolutionary days 
were characterized by (1) the scarcity of reading material 
1]bid. pp. 91-92.
-P-A-G-E-24
  14 THE TEACHING OF READING 
(2) the inability of the many to read, (3) the slowness of com- 
munication, and (4) the consequent importance of spoken 
language as the chief means of communication, the social needs 
of the present are characterized by conditions which are ex- 
actly the reverse. The free public libraries of our cities and 
towns provide the people access to books by the tens of thou- 
sands. Hundreds of bulletins are published annually by depart- 
ments of our state and national governments and distributed 
for the asking. The daily newspaper and the monthly period- 
ical are distributed regularly by the postal service to the most 
remote sections of the Union. News by wire and wireless is 
transmitted to all parts of the world in the space of a few hours. 
The ability to read is practically universal; the census of 1920 
reveals only about 6 per cent of the population as en ails 
Written language is the chief means of communication. 
. The aim of reading instruction should be different. Notwith- 
standing the marked contrast in social needs that has just been 
pointed out, the former emphasis on expressive oral reading has 
hardly diminished in a large number of schools, and effective 
rapid silent reading has been grossly neglected. The changing 
times impose upon us new social demands. Information must 
be secured nowadays in a hurry and from a variety of sources. 
Every calling, trade, and profession has its own body of litera- 
ture, and the literature of a single vocation is now so extensive 
that one can hardly keep himself informed on the number of 
articles published, not to mention the opportunity to read them 
all.-Nowadays one does not have the time to read orally for 
expression ; indeed, there is little occasion to, and but few have 
the time or the inclination to listen. To keep abreast of the 
times one must read silently for meaning for his own pleasure 
and enlightenment, and, what is equally important, he must 
read rapidly in order to cover as wide a range of subject matter 
as possible and to avoid becoming narrow in his views and 
-( red. self-centered. V
-P-A-G-E-25
  _ THE AIMS OF READING INSTRUCTION 15 
Moreover, the changing times impose new demands upon the 
schools. Social needs have changed, and the aim of reading 
instruction should change accordingly. Because expressive oral 
reading met the needs of the past is no reason why the schools 
should continue to emphasize expressive oral reading; it is, 
rather, one good reason for changing the emphasis to a different 
phase of instruction in the subject. The demands for a con- 
sideration of the problem are voiced in the following excerpt 
from a well-known textbook which discusses reading methods: 
Whatever side of reading we consider we are challenged to investi- 
gate. For instance, we have long known that some readers read four 
times as fast as others of equal intelligence and yet obtain better results. 
Yet we have remained content to completely ignore the question of 
rate in teaching to read; the only times it is mentioned usually being 
when the pupil is cautioned “not to read too fast.” We know that the 
reading of life is almost exclusively silent reading. Yet in preparing 
for life we are instructed almost exclusively in reading aloud, and have 
not troubled ourselves to ask whether habits learned in reading aloud 
may not be hurtful in reading silently.* 
That the schools have continued to emphasize oral reading is 
evidenced by the prevailing social neglect of silent reading. 
Such social neglect is illustrated in the very common practice 
we have in shaping our opinions of political, economic, social, 
and other affairs by reading the short editorials of the daily 
newspapers rather than by gleaning the essential facts for our- 
selves in an effective rapid survey of the information from a 
number of sources. For example, we read a short editorial 
which discusses the president’s message (or any other impor- 
tant topic), and we form our opinion of it according to the 
political faith of the editor; we usually neglect the reading of 
the entire message (or topic) as a basis for our own inde- 
pendent judgment.

    16 THE TEACHING OF READING 
Conclusion: effective rapid silent reading is the important 
aim of reading instruction. The contrast of the social needs 
of colonial and Revolutionary days with those of our own time 
serves to convince us that the need for expressive oral reading 
which formerly prevailed now no longer exists. We are obliged 
to conclude that written language is now the chief means of 
communication, that large amounts of reading are necessary in 
our complex democratic society, that reading must be rapid, 
that it must secure the meaning, and that it must be largely for 
one’s own individual benefit. 
Summary. The importance of a correct understanding on 
the part of the teacher of the aims of reading instruction was 
made clear (1) by a number of observations of wasted efforts 
resulting from mistaken aims and (2) by several quotations 
from educational literature which show the very great variety 
of interpretation of what reading instruction should aim to 
accomplish. The discussion led to the conclusion that the aim 
of reading instruction should be clear-cut and definite and that 
it should be to develop either expressive oral readers or effec- 
tive rapid silent readers. Which is the important aim, accord- 
ingly, became the problem of the chapter. The problem was 
examined for solution from the social point of view, and a solu- 
tion was built up on the basis of the present-day needs of 
society. It was pointed out that the social needs of a former 
time required that reading instruction should emphasize ex- 
pressive oral reading, and, further, that the social needs of the 
present, being different from those of a former day, demand a 
different type of instruction from that which formerly pre- 
vailed. (Thus we reached our solution; namely, that the aim 
of reading instruction which should now prevail is to develop 
ability in effective rapid silent reading. 
The theme of this book is thus established. Skillful silent 
reading for meaning being the art to be developed through read- 
ing instruction, succeeding chapters will describe its nature 
and trace its development through the grades.

  CHAPTER II 
THE IMPORTANCE OF READING INSTRUCTION 
The connection with the preceding chapter. The preceding 
chapter on the aims of reading instruction emphasized the fact 
that the needs of society demand training in reading of a par- 
ticular character. The social needs of a former time were 
discussed, and the contrast with those of the present day was 
very sharply drawn. The effort of the whole discussion was to 
make clear that present-day social needs are of the utmost 
importance. To the extent that this effort was successful the 
importance of reading was stressed in the preceding chapter. 
The present chapter is therefore a continuation of the pre- 
ceding one. 
The importance of reading usually conceded, but not gen- 
erally understood. Elementary-school teachers will as a rule 
grant the contention that reading is the most important subject 
that is taught in the schools. They are aware that success in all 
the other subjects of the curriculum depends upon the very 
fundamental ability to read. They are not willing, however, 
always to grant that the problem of teaching history, geog- 
raphy, nature study, etc. in the grades is primarily a problem 
in reading. They are more often influenced by a suggestion to 
neglect reading in favor of “content” subjects, which are said 
to be “more important to children,” than they are by the neces- 
sity of confining their efforts to perfecting the art of reading in 
conjunction with and as a preparation for instruction in content 
subjects. The following quotations from “Course of Study 
for the Elementary Schools and Junior High Schools of West 
18 
 
-P-A-G-E-29
  ati THE IMPORTANCE OF READING INSTRUCTION 19 
Virginia, 1918,”1 are illustrative of the conflict in attitude 
toward reading which is quite prevalent among teachers. Ordi- 
narily reading is held to be the most important subject of study: 
Reading is the most important subject in the curriculum. It is the 
most important study because nearly all of the other subjects depend 
upon it. Arithmetic, geography, history, and other branches are studied 
in large part through books which the pupil must read. (P. 29.) 
In practice, however, reading is very frequently neglected in 
favor of other and more attractive activities: 
The best authorities agree that we have hitherto given too much time 
to primary reading to the exclusion of other subjects more important to 
children of this age. The first year of school life should be given to the 
child’s “own experiences,” to use Professor Huey’s expression. Nature 
study, handwork, story-telling, memorizing poetry, conversation about 
the child’s home interests, and group games are the most important 
means of leading the child from home life to the larger, more organized 
life of the school. Reading in the first year should be subordinated to 
real life. For example, directions for handwork and for playing games 
may be written on the blackboard instead of being given orally. In this 
way children learn that reading is a means of communicating thought, 
since they cannot do the desired thing unless they can read the direc- 
tions. This habit of connecting action with reading should begin with 
the first school year. (P. 36.) 
The conclusion to be drawn from the very evident contra- 
diction in belief which is expressed in the two quotations above 
is that though teachers are quite ready to concede that reading 
is the most important study to be taught in the schools, they are 
not as a rule sufficiently impressed with the importance of the 
subject always to give it the place of most advantage in their 
teaching programs. The need of having our attention quite 
frequently called to the importance of reading instruction is 
very clearly demonstrated. Let us direct our attention, there- 
fore, to the various reasons why reading is the study of most

-P-A-G-E-30
    20 THE TEACHING OF READING 
importance in our schools. We may do this by considering 
(1) the importance of reading as a necessary preparation for 
the study of other subjects, (2) the importance of reading as 
an occupation for the enjoyment of leisure, and (3) the impor- 
tance of reading as a qualification for good citizenship. 
The relation of reading to other subjects. The quite intimate 
relationship that the subject of reading bears to the other 
studies of the school is not inherent in the subjects themselves ; 
it is rather a relationship resulting from the methods of instruc- 
tion that are practiced in our schools. That the relationship is 
not one of subject matter is easily discernible in a comparison 
of the types of learning represented by the various subjects. 
For example, reading is a type of perceptual learning; arith- 
metic and number must be learned through abstraction ; history 
and geography require the exercise of one’s ; imagination. It is 
entirely possible for a student to make considerable progress in 
learning the number concept and to become proficient in 
number manipulation long before he has acquired the mastery 
of the difficult art of reading. Likewise, the materials of history 
and geography may be made familiar to him by means other 
than reading. It is obvious that ability to read is important in 
learning other subjects only as use is made of it as a tool of 
learning. As a tool of learning, reading is fundamental to all 
other subjects. Because the methods of learning every other 
subject in school (except handwriting and the manual arts) 
employ reading as a necessary instrument of learning, it be- 
comes the most fundamental subject in the curriculum and 
likewise the most important.. The importance of reading as a 
fundamental subject is emphasized in the somewhat distinctive 
methods of instruction which prevail in American schools. 
American schools are reading schools. The methods of in- 
struction which prevail in American schools are not usually 
thought of by teachers as being at all different from the methods 
employed in the schools of other countries. The important fact 
is that the methods used in American schools are distinctly
-P-A-G-E-31
  
THE IMPORTANCE OF READING INSTRUCTION 21 
American in development and in spirit. When compared with 
the methods which prevail in European countries, those that 
are peculiar to American schools stand out in sharp contrast. 
For example, the German boy of a decade ago learned his 
geography and history and formed his ideas of German power 
and greatness and of the infallibility of German institutions 
and political privileges not by an independent study of his 
textbook nor through the use of a number of supplementary 
reading books; he developed the ability by means of his school- 
ing to listen attentively to lectures by his teachers and to 
absorb verbatim the statements he heard. Independent read- 
ing was not an accomplishment of the pupil of the Volksschule. 
The learning he received made practically no demands upon 
any native ability that might be peculiarly his own. Everything 
he learned was exactly as his teacher told it to him; he learned 
that thoroughly—nothing more. 
Contrast the methods employed in American schools. Here 
the pupil is given instruction during the first three years of his 
school life for the purpose of enabling him to master the 
mechanics of reading. In the fourth grade, textbooks in geog- 
raphy, arithmetic, language, history, hygiene, etc. are put into 
his hands, and year by year an ever-increasing supply of text- 
books and supplementary reading books are provided for his 
study and perusal. What is the significance of the fact that 
textbooks are provided in ever-increasing number after the 
third year of school? The answer is that the pupil is presumed 
to be able by the end of the third grade to read well enough to 
secure the necessary amount of meaning from the printed page 
to justify an independent study of books. The fact that many 
pupils in the later grades of the school are unable to secure 
the required amount of meaning through reading from the 
textbooks put into their hands only goes to show that the 
primary grades have failed to accomplish the results intended 
on schedule time. In the primary grades the child learns to 
read; in succeeding grades he reads to learn.  
-P-A-G-E-32
  
22 THE TEACHING OF READING 
The method of teaching in American schools is essentially a 
textbook method, which is, of course, a reading method. Courses 
of study are outlined and conducted in accordance with an 
adopted text or a combination of several texts. The study that 
is carried on by the pupils is usually individual study of text- 
books. It is not implied, of course, that all that a pupil learns 
of a subject is read out of his text. In the recitation periods 
and in a variety of exercises the pupil is made acquainted with 
the concrete experiences which relate to the subject he is 
studying, and these concrete experiences are employed to en- 
rich the reading material of his textbooks. The important point 
for our purposes is that the pupil is enabled to classify his 
concrete experiences and to secure an explanation of them by 
means of his reading. The point for our consideration is that 
such subjects as geography, hygiene, nature study, history, etc. 
would be exceedingly narrow subjects if no opportunities were 
provided for pupils, or if pupils were unable to classify and to 
explain and to enlarge through reading their concrete experi- 
ences in these subjects. If we will examine the pupils of our 
classrooms, we can without difficulty make the following dis- 
covery for ourselves: the pupils who are not interested and 
those who fail to perform the required amount of work are the 
ones whose reading is very laborious and those who do little: 
reading; the pupils who are interested are the ones who have a 
complete mastery of the art of reading and whose reading is 
very wide. The method of American schools is a reading 
method; American schools are reading schools. 
The reading method is American in spirit. A brief summary 
of preceding paragraphs will dispose of this topic. A reading 
method does not hold out its rewards to those who follow blindly 
the discourses of another; the rewards go rather to those who 
have the individual initiative to make use of their individual 
abilities to secure information and ideas for themselves. In- 
dividual interpretation is an important permission of the Amer- 
ican method of learning by means of reading. 
 
-P-A-G-E-33
  THE IMPORTANCE OF READING INSTRUCTION 23 
The reading method is American in development. The es- 
sentially American feature of the reading method of instruction 
is to be seen in the way it developed. It is an outgrowth of the 
demand of the early Puritans that each person be given the 
necessary training in the schools to enable him, without the aid 
of an interpreter, to read the Bible for himself. In 1647 the 
General Court of the colony of Massachusetts passed a law 
requiring the establishment of schools for the purpose of giving 
instruction in reading. The preamble of the law is as follows: 
It being one chief point of that old deluder, Satan, to keep men from 
the knowledge of the Scriptures, as in former times, by keeping them 
in an unknown tongue, so in these latter times, by persuading from the 
use of tongues, that so at last the true sense and meaning of the original 
might be clouded by false glosses of saint-seeming deceivers, that 
learning might not be buried in the grave of our fathers in church and 
commonwealth, the Lord assisting our endeavors,—It is therefore 
ordered that every township in this jurisdiction, after the Lord has 
increased them to the number of fifty householders, shall then forthwith 
appoint one within their town to teach all such children as shall resort 
to him to write and read.t * 
The general purposes of instruction in the schools have be- 
come in these later days considerably broader than those im- 
plied in the law of 1647, but the fundamental purpose has 
remained essentially the same—to develop in each individual 
the ability of independent interpretation. 
In the foregoing paragraphs we have discussed the impor- 
tance of reading instruction from the standpoint of its relation- 
ship to the other studies of the school. We now pass to the 
second phase of our discussion; namely, the importance of 
reading as an occupation for the enjoyment of leisure. 
Bobbitt on “reading as a leisure occupation.” Perhaps the 
most illuminating chapter that has ever been written on the 
importance of reading as an occupation for the enjoyment of 
1Quoted by S. C. Parker, The History of Modern Elementary Education,

-P-A-G-E-34
  24 THE TEACHING OF READING 
leisure is the one by Professor Bobbitt entitled “Reading as a 
Leisure Occupation.” We do well to shape our discussion in 
accordance with its terms. 
The leisure occupation of primitive man. Apart from the 
physical activities indulged in for the sake of leisure occupation 
primitive man devoted his leisure hours to the observation of 
the men and things that made up the restricted world in which 
he lived and moved. He observed his associates and took note 
of their actions, dress, property, habits, etc.; he kept watch as 
well upon animals, plants, climate, and natural phenomena. He 
studied all these through the medium of direct observation and 
through listening to the reports of others. His motive was in- 
terest in things in general ; he enjoyed his personal observations. 
Primitive man was motivated to this direct and indirect observation 
in part by his serious purposes ; but in large part simply by his interest 
in things in general. In the latter there was no conscious purpose of 
putting his knowledge to practical use. In fact he could not judge the 
value of the information until he had apprehended it. It was mainly a 
leisure activity ; and leaving aside the purely physical, it was probably 
by far his most important leisure occupation.” 
His leisure occupation answered an important purpose of nature. 
Nature’s purpose in providing so adequately for this leisure occupation 
is clear. The man had to move and act within this circle of things and 
forces and influences, and to shape his conduct to them all. In the unex- 
pected mutations of human affairs he never could know with which of 
the many things he was to be concerned. He had to be watchful of the 
whole pageant of community affairs in order to be prepared for the 
specific adjustments that conditions should demand. Interrelations and 
interdependencies were innumerable. Rightly to know any part required 
that one know the whole, and through this all its parts. The most useful 
thing was an adequate vision of the total pageant of community life and 
of the conditioning setting or background. 
Nature’s purpose remains the same in modern life. So in 
these later days is the purpose of nature manifested in the pro-

-P-A-G-E-35
THE IMPORTANCE OF READING INSTRUCTION 25 
vision it makes for us to prepare ourselves for any possible 
contingency which may arise in our lives by endowing us with a 
lively interest in human affairs. Like the savage, we are un- 
able to foresee the problems we must face on the morrow; like 
the savage also, we prepare to meet any possible problem which 
may arise by informing ourselves during our leisure moments 
upon all possible conditions and circumstances of human af- 
fairs. With us, too, “interest in things in general” is the motive, 
usually not any serious purpose. Unlike the savage, however, 
we are obliged to meet problems many times more complex, and 
likewise to observe conditions and customs and motives and 
affairs in an environment as wide as the world. To the extent 
that we fail to observe the circumstances and conditions of 
human affairs in all their various ramifications are we unable 
to shape our conduct in accordance with them. 
Our methods of observation are more elaborate than those 
of primitive man. Primitive man carried on his observation of 
human affairs and natural phenomena either directly or by 
listening to the reports of others. We are compelled to make 
use of methods which are much more elaborate. Very little of 
world affairs can be observed either by direct observation or by 
listening to oral reports. It is a physical impossibility for one to 
travel to all parts of the world in order to carry on direct ob- 
servation. Then, too, direct observation and likewise oral re- 
ports include only what is present. We need today to know 
what is past in order rightly to interpret the present. The eyes 
of sense and the eyes of oral language fail us. The demands of 
modern life require that a greater and greater use be made of 
the eyes of written language, which is reading. 
The following quotations from Bobbitt illustrate the chief 
instrument of observation that we have at our command and 
the means by which it may be employed as a leisure occupation: 
In that early day, learning was experiential. Men were not con- 
sciously learning or memorizing facts. They lived; and the mind was 
filled with memories, the normal residua of experience. And general- 
 
-P-A-G-E-36
  26 THE TEACHING OF READING 
ized understanding like the trunk and branches of a tree simply grew 
up imperceptibly and unconsciously so as to constitute the relatively 
unchanging fundamentals of their mental life, while the deciduous 
foliage of their transient experiences came and went. 
In our day, original human nature is relatively unchanged. We have 
no reason to think that there is possible any new form of education 
that can be an improvement upon the experiential education of the 
past. New conditions demand adaptations, adjustment of proportions, 
the use of new and improved instruments, etc.; but at bottom, as 
indicated by all of our progressive recent movements in education, it is 
still felt that experiential education constitutes the best training for the 
individual. If the principle holds, then the purpose of the reading is 
the reconstruction of experience. It is to be a mode of living. It is not 
to be a didactic verbal presentation of unrooted facts and generaliza- 
tions to be memorized, recited upon, examined upon, and then in due 
process forgotten; leaving little more than the unwholesome residua 
of disagreeable learning experience.t 
. . . We are here only saying that that portion of the world which 
lies beyond the horizon is also to be given the greatest possible degree 
of reality in the minds of the children. Abstract didacticism does not give 
them this sense of reality. A half-page exposition of the codfishing indus- 
try, for example, off the banks of Newfoundland gives the children no es- 
sential realization of the nature of that industry. Let them, however, read 
Kipling’s “Captains Courageous,” and thus indirectly participate in the 
various activities and experiences of the fishing fleet off Newfoundland, 
and they will have come into contact with that type of human experi- 
ence almost as efficaciously as if they had been actually upon the 
waters. Let them in the same vivid way travel in spirit across the wide 
plains of Russia, up the rivers of China, through the jungles of Africa 
or Brazil, across the Polar ice-fields, with the ore-fleets of the United 
States Steel Corporation, live upon the cotton plantations of the South, 
the great wheat farms of the Northwest, in the timber regions of 
Georgia and Oregon, etc.,—let them thus know realities from vital con- 
tacts with them and only then are they prepared for the geographical 
problem-solving which should develop an understanding of the more 
general influences, forces, and relationships. Experiential education 
aims at the greatest possible educational efficiency, substantiality, and 
practicality of result. It employs interest for the sake of vividness and

massiveness of experience; not for the sake of pleasantness. It uses 
pleasantness as a means; not as an end.t 
So long has our profession taught that we think the only way to 
educate is to teach. We have not sufficiently known that ¢o live will 
also educate. We have been busy providing the conditions for teaching. 
Only recently are we coming to know how to provide the conditions for 
living. Both have a place; and the main thing is living.” 
The importance of reading instruction as a preparation for 
the enjoyment and for the most profitable use of one’s leisure 
is very forcibly demonstrated in the chapter of which the above 
quotations are a part. 
We turn now to the consideration of the third point of our 
discussion, on the importance of reading as a qualification for 
good citizenship. 
Popular government demands an enlightened citizenship. 
The necessity of a high degree of intelligence on the part of the 
citizens of a government such as ours is implied in the definition 
of a popular government: A popular government, to use the 
terms of Lincoln, is a “government of the people, by the people, 
for the people.” The success of any government is determined 
by the intelligence of its governing class. In America the people 
rule through their representatives, and this government “of the 
people” is successful and efficient and representative and de- 
voted to the interests of all the people only to the extent that 
the people themselves are intelligent and well-informed. This 
fact was keenly appreciated by the founders of our government. 
Witness the following expressions by Thomas Jefferson and 
James Madison: 
[Said Jefferson] If a nation expects to be ignorant and free in a 
state of civilization it expects what never was and never will be. 
. There is no safe deposit [for the functions of government], but 
with the people themselves; nor can they be safe with them without 
information.®

28 THE TEACHING OF READING 
: ‘James Madison, fourth president of the United States, wrote: 
A popular government without popular information or the means of 
acquiring it is but a prologue to a farce or a tragedy, or, perhaps, both. 
Knowledge will forever govern ignorance ; and a people who mean to be 
their own governors must arm themselves with the power which 
knowledge gives.t 
The Russian Soviet government as an illustration. To use the 
language of Jefferson, “what never was and never will be,”— 
that is, a nation which is both “ignorant and free in a state of 
civilization,’—is nowhere better illustrated than in the debacle 
of Bolshevism in Russia which followed close upon the heels of 
the revolutionary movementin 1917. Immediately following the 
overthrow of the autocratic government of the Czar and the 
establishment of the right of the people of Russia to rule them- 
selves, there began to manifest themselves the inevitable conse- 
quences of a “popular government without popular information 
or the means of acquiring it.” The people in whose hands was 
the authority of government neither had the necessary informa- 
tion on howto govern themselves nor did they possess the means, 
through the ability to read, of acquiring it. They fell an easy 
prey to the influence of unscrupulous leaders. The results are 
familiar to all: out of a semblance of order, there has developed 
chaos; out of a worthy attempt to set up a government by all 
the people, there has resulted a dominance of the masses by the 
unscrupulous few; out of a democracy, there has grown up an 
autocracy which possesses none of the benefits but all the op- 
pressiveness of the paternalistic, autocratic government which 
the revolution overthrew in the beginning. The reader will do 
well to re-read the words of Jefferson and Madison and to apply 
them to the situation which has developed in Bolshevik Russia. 
American local governments do not escape the effects of 
ignorance and illiteracy. It is not necessary to go as far away

as Russia in order to note the evil effects of ignorance and 
illiteracy upon a government “of the people.” Writing in 1914 
on the “Social Effects of Immigration,” Professor E. A. Ross 
describes the local government of a certain anthracite town as 
follows : 
There is a certain anthracite town of 26,000 inhabitants in which 
are writ large the moral and social consequences of injecting 10,000 
sixteenth-century people into a twentieth-century community. By their 
presence the foreigners necessarily lower the general plane of intelligence, 
self-restraint, refinement, orderliness, and efficiency. . . . [Three eighths 
of the men are illiterate. ] 
Barriers of speech, education, and religious faith split the people into 
unsympathetic, even hostile camps. The worst element in the com- 
munity makes use of the ignorance and venality of the foreign-born 
voters to exclude the better citizens from any share in the control of 
local affairs. In this babel no newspaper becomes strong enough to 
mold and lead public opinion. On account of the smallness of the 
English-reading public, . . . the single English daily has so few sub- 
scribers that it cannot afford to offend any of them by exposing munic- 
ipal rottenness. . . . 
With the basest Americans and the lowest foreigners united by 
thirst and greed, while the decent Americans and the decent foreigners 
understand one another too little for teamwork, it is not surprising that 
the municipal government is poor and that the taxpayers are robbed.1 
The local government here described is by no means an iso- 
lated example of the undermining effects of ignorance and illit- 
eracy upon our democratic institutions. Like examples are 
to be found on every hand. The appeal of the “yellow” news- 
papers; the far-reaching effects of hostile propaganda by the 
agents of Germany and Austria-Hungary at the outbreak of 
the World War; the spread of anarchy and syndicalism among 
certain sections of our population; the new prominence and 
influence of the I. W. W.; the ease with which “leagues,” “so- 
cieties,” and “parties” are formed for other than the national

  30 _ THE TEACHING OF READING 
welfare; the alarming proportions recently assumed by the 
“spirit of unrest,”—these and many like conditions impress the 
thoughtful citizen with the fact that the ignorant, illiterate, and 
near-illiterate constitute a social and political menace to the 
government. The thoughtful citizen becomes impressed by the 
necessity of substituting a condition of literacy for the condi- 
tion of illiteracy, wherever it prevails, and of replacing igno- 
rance of the spirit and purposes of the American government 
with information and enlightenment. ‘Popular information” 
for the members of this “popular government” is the only 
effective remedy for conditions which assail the permanence of 
our free institutions. 
Conclusion: the ability to read is a necessary qualification 
for citizenship. The method by which the requisite informa- 
tion for good citizenship is to be acquired is quite clear. As it 
was pointed out in the preceding chapter, written language 
now is the chief means of communication. Ability to read be- 
comes, therefore, a very important and necessary qualification 
for citizenship. The following paragraphs are very effective as 
a summary statement upon this point: 
Illiteracy bears intimately upon many national problems. The 
government of the United States is a government by representation, 
and its integrity and effectiveness depend upon the intelligence of all 
the people. Intelligence rests mainly upon easy transfer of thought 
and information from one person to another by the printed page. 
Therefore any material increase in the number of those who cannot 
read affects quality of citizenship and the representative basis of govern- 
ment. In an illiterate community the sense of civic responsibility is at 
its lowest, and disease, social isolation, and industrial inefficiency are 
found in highest degree. 
It is difficult for those who can read easily to form even a bare con- 
ception of the mental limitations of the illiterate, the near-illiterate, and 
the nonreader. It is still harder to appreciate the material handicaps 
to earning a livelihood entailed by illiteracy. While illiteracy does not 
necessarily imply ignorance, it does predicate lack of information, com- 
prehension, and understanding. It increases prejudice, suspicion, and

passion, and diminishes mutual appreciation and power to codperate ; 
yet codperation is the essence of modern civilization, and inability to 
codperate is the basis of race hatred. So that illiteracy is clearly a just 
topic for national solicitude and its eradication a proper subject for 
governmental action.t 
Summary. In the present chapter the need of having our 
attention frequently called to the importance of reading in- 
struction was the first point to be discussed. The need was dem- 
onstrated that while teachers usually grant that reading is 
extremely important, they are often willing to neglect it in 
favor of more attractive subjects. The importance of*reading 
instruction was then discussed from the following three points 
of view: (1) as-a necessary preparation for the study of other 
subjects; (2) as an occupation for the enjoyment of leisure; 
(3) as a necessary qualification for good citizenship.

  CHAPTER III 
WHEN SHALL READING BEGIN? 
The preceding chapter has been quite emphatic in its con- 
clusion that reading is the most important subject taught in 
the grades. Part II of this book will devote itself to the con- 
tention that reading is an elaborate, difficult, and highly com- 
plex mechanical process which demands in its mastery carefully 
formulated direction and guidance on the part of the teacher 
and serious effort and application of no mean order on the part 
of the pupil. It would seem to follow from a complete evalua- 
tion of the foregoing statements, which summarize and forecast 
important discussions of this book, that reading instruction ought 
to begin with the first day of the child’s school life; that impor- 
tance of the subject, and difficulty as well, emphasize the need 
of an early beginning. And it would seem, further, to be en- 
tirely proper to take for granted the conclusion just stated and 
to omit from our discussion considerations at length of the 
question raised in the heading of this chapter. 
But the question cannot thus be lightly pushed aside. There 
have been in the past deliberate, if well-intentioned, attacks 
upon the position of prominence that has always been held by 
reading in the early grades of the school. 
In the New York Teachers’ Monographs, November, 1898, Professor 
Dewey says that while there are exceptions, “present psychological 
knowledge points to the age of about eight years as early enough for 
anything more than an incidental attention to visual and written 
language-form.”+

  WHEN SHALL READING BEGIN? 33 
These attacks have been made with such vigor and pursued 
with such far-reaching results as to demand in our present 
discussion careful consideration as to their validity. There are, 
moreover, in addition to the ones implied in the opening state- 
ments of the foregoing paragraph, other reasons for engaging 
in a defense of learning to read at an early age. Accordingly 
the present chapter opens with a twofold purpose definitely 
marked out: (1) to consider the validity of the attacks that 
have been made upon the teaching of reading in the primary 
grades and (2) to present the arguments in defense of the time- 
honored practice. 
The attacks on early reading have been based on theoretical 
instead of practical grounds. The two attacks on the practice 
of beginning the teaching of reading in the early grades of the 
school that have been given most prominence in educational 
literature are those of Professors Dewey? and Patrick? That 
their attacks have been made from considerations of theory 
rather than from those of practice can be readily seen in the 
following brief summarization of their arguments. 
1. The child of six lacks a motive for learning to read. Acquaint him 
with the interesting features of his environment; allow him to engage 
in physical activities; let him deal with objects instead of ideas; tell 
him interesting stories. Later he will feel a need for reading. Then the 
task of teaching him to read will be an easy one. 
2. Concrete knowledge should always precede the use of symbols. 
Reading deals with symbols and should therefore be postponed. More- 
over, learning begins with sensations. Sense training, then, should not 
be set aside to make room for mere language training. 
3. The child of six is a social being. Learning to read is such an indi- 
vidual process as to detract from the child’s natural interests in society. 
Reading becomes, therefore, a wholly unintelligible process and, be- 
cause it is such, it should be postponed.

34 THE TEACHING OF READING 
4. The history of the individual is an abridgment of the history of 
the race. Since the art of reading had a late development in the history 
of the race, provision should be made for it to have a correspondingly 
late development in so far as the individual child is concerned. 
5. Eye fatigue, eye strain, myopia and other eye defects result from 
early reading. Moreover, the sense organs and nervous systems of 
young children are not adapted to such confining work as learning 
to read. 
6. Bad study habits are formed through early reading. Besides, a 
certain mental enfeeblement comes from too early an appeal to interest 
in the abstractions of reading. Let us postpone the teaching of reading 
and avoid all such dangers. 
One is tempted to inquire, after a perusal of the arguments 
here summarized, whether they were first submitted to a com- 
mittee of public-school teachers for approval before they were 
committed to print. 
The attacks appear to be not entirely free from prejudice. 
The terminology of the authors of the attacks on early reading 
inclines one to the belief that they have not been careful to 
refrain from the attempt to influence their readers in favor of 
their contentions by means other than the arguments they 
present. For example, Professor Dewey is skillful in inviting a 
favorable frame of mind for the perusal of his article in his 
selection of a title; namely, “The Primary Education Fetich.” 
His opening paragraphs are not such as to free the reader from 
this suspicion: 
It is some years since the educational world was more or less agitated 
by an attack upon the place occupied by Greek in the educational 
scheme. If, however, Greek occupies the place of a fetich, its worshipers 
are comparatively few in number, and its influence is relatively slight. 
There is, however, a false educational god whose idolaters are legion, 
and whose cult influences the entire educational system. This is language- 
study—the study not of foreign language, but of English; not in 
higher, but in primary education. It is almost an unquestioned assump- 
tion of educational theory and practice both that the first three years 
of a child’s school life shall be mainly taken up with learning to read
-P-A-G-E-45
  WHEN SHALL READING BEGIN? 35 
and write his own language. If we add to this the learning of a certain 
amount of numerical combinations, we have the pivot about which pri- 
miary education swings. Other subjects may be taught, but they are 
introduced in strict subordination. 
The very fact that this procedure, as part of the natural and estab- 
lished course of education, is assumed as inevitable—opposition being 
regarded as captious and revolutionary—indicates that, historically, 
there are good reasons assigned to these studies. It does not follow, 
however, that because this course was once wise it is so any longer. On 
the contrary, the fact that this mode of education was adapted to past 
conditions is in itself a reason why it should no longer hold supreme 
sway. The present has its claims. It is in education, if anywhere, that 
the claims of the present should be controlling. To educate on the basis 
of past surroundings is like adapting an organism to an environment 
which no longer exists. The individual is stultified, if not disintegrated, 
and the course of progress is blocked. 
Again, in the article by Professor Patrick, one finds that the 
appeal seems’ to be made to sentiment and not to reason. The 
following quotations are illustrative : 
. . . It is conceivable, therefore, that the present accepted order of 
studies in our elementary schools rests upon accidental rather than upon 
a psychological basis. . . . 
. . . Although the appropriateness and economy of this study (nature 
study) for young children has been known and proclaimed for more 
than a century, it is still in practice the study of later years, while 
young children study Jetters. 
. ..In practice we are saying to the young child: “Man is a 
sedentary, reading, writing, thinking, reasoning being, possessing the 
power of voluntary attention. I am to educate you to be a man. There- 
fore you must learn to sit still, to read, write, think, reason, and give 
attention to your work.” The child of six or eight years is therefore 
given a book or pen, and put into a closely fitting seat and left to give 
attention to his work. This is precisely as if the mother should say to 
the infant at the beginning of the period of creeping: ‘You are a man, 
not a brute. Men go upright, not on all fours. You must walk, not 
creep.”

-P-A-G-E-46
36 THE TEACHING OF READING 
. . . Our schools are exceedingly conservative. Any innovations or 
radical changes are resisted by the parents of the children even more 
strenuously than by school boards, superintendents, and teachers. Not- 
withstanding numerous and important minor improvements, the school 
system as a whole remains unchanged. Our children of seven and eight 
years are learning to read and write because our grandfathers were so 
doing at that age.? 
On such grounds, if they were valid, the ancient customs of 
reading the Bible and obeying one’s parents might be brought 
under severe indictment. 
The attacks convert specific criticisms into general ones. 
One becomes most impatient with attacks on the organization 
of the course of study in reading when they make use of criti- 
cisms, valid and otherwise, of prevailing methods of teaching 
as arguments in favor of a delay in beginning. For example, 
Professor Patrick would leave the impression that his well- 
taken criticism of improper methods is an argument against 
the subject as a whole: 
One of the greatest goods which would follow the banishing of the 
book from the primary and elementary schools would be the cultivation 
of better mental habits. Children suffer lasting injury by being left 
with a book in their seats and directed to “study” at an age when the 
power of voluntary attention has not developed. They then acquire 
habits of listlessness and mind-wandering afterward difficult to over- 
come. They read over many times that which does not hold their 
attention and is not remembered. Lax habits of study are thus acquired, 
with the serious incidental result of weakening the retentive power, 
which depends so much upon interest and concentration. With the 
substitution of the oral for the book method, reliance upon the memory 
for the memory period will permanently strengthen the child’s power 
of retention.” 
In like vein are the following criticisms. Speaking of the 
“utter triviality of the contents of our school primers and first

-P-A-G-E-47
  WHEN SHALL READING BEGIN? 37 
readers,” Professor Dewey suggests taking up the first half- 
dozen such books you meet and asking yourself “how much 
there is in the ideas presented worthy of respect from any intel- 
ligent child of six years.” Moreover, 
[Methods of teaching reading] all lack the essentials of any well- 
grounded method; namely, relevancy to the child’s mental needs. No 
scheme for learning to read can supply this want. Only a new motive, 
putting the child into a vital relation to the materials to be read, can be 
of service here. It is evident that this condition cannot be met, unless 
learning to read be postponed to a period when the child’s intellectual 
appetite is more consciously active, and when he is mature enough to 
deal more rapidly and effectively with the formal and mechanical 
difficulties. 
And finally: 
. . . The causes are many [of the increase of myopia and other defects 
of the eye among school children], but it is scarcely doubted that the 
chief cause is found in bending over finely printed books and maps, 
and fine writing, pencil work, and drawing. If pencils, pens, paper, and 
books could be kept away from children until they are at least ten 
years of age, and their instruction come directly from objects and from 
the voice of the teacher, this evil could be greatly lessened.? 
The foregoing criticisms bring under indictment (1) methods 
of study that are frequently imposed upon children in the 
grades, (2) the content of primary reading material, (3) meth- 
ods of teaching reading, and (4) the unhygienic features of 
some reading books, the unsatisfactory results of all of which 
may be overcome by means other than by eliminating reading 
from the course of study of the primary school. The effort of 
the educator should be directed toward an improvement in 
methods and in the content and mechanical features of primary 
reading books, not against the subject itself.

  38 THE TEACHING OF READING 
Criticisms of attacks summarized. The arguments in defense 
of early reading. Thus far our discussion has constituted an 
examination of the attacks that have been made upon the 
teaching of reading in the primary grades. Through a summa- 
rization of the attacks, and directly from two of the attacks 
themselves, they have been shown to be open to the following 
criticisms : 
1. That they have been based on theoretical instead of prac- 
tical grounds. 
2. That they appear to be not entirely free from prejudice. 
3. That they convert specific criticisms into general ones. 
We come now to the fulfillment of the second important pur- 
pose of the chapter, which is to present the arguments in 
defense of the time-honored practice of beginning the teaching 
of reading in the first grade. Our effort shall be to impress the 
point that the age of six is the crucial age to begin, because at 
that age (1) the child’s preparation in oral language is sufficient 
to enable him to learn written language; (2) his habits of oral 
speech have not become so fixed as to delay the process of 
acquiring a command of written speech; (3) his out-of-school 
interests are not so great as to detract considerably from the 
activities necessary to the learning of written language; (4) he 
is actuated through motives of social imitation. Let us consider 
each argument in turn. 
The child’s earlier years are spent in acquiring a command 
of oral language. One of the most interesting periods in the 
intellectual development of the child is the one in which he 
emerges from the state of total dependence on his elders for 
the interpretation of his wants and needs into the state of being 
able to make his wants and needs known to others. This is the 
period of development which precedes the age at which he is 
sent to school. It is the period during which he acquires a com- 
mand of oral language sufficient to express his wants to others 
and to understand what others want him to do. It is the period 
during which his responsibilities develop to the point where he
-P-A-G-E-49
WHEN SHALL READING BEGIN? 39 
can safely be intrusted to take his place as a member of the 
social group of the school. The home and the kindergarten are 
the institutions which provide the necessary training. 
In the home the child imitates the speech of his elders. Grad- 
ually, as he acquires a stock of words, he learns to attach to 
each the appropriate meaning-reaction. Through imitation and 
inquiry, and at the expense of considerable effort, he learns to 
group words into sentences. Very often, if not usually, sen- 
tences are learned as wholes as the expressions of single ideas. 
Sometimes words are acquired before the appropriate ideas and 
meanings; at other times the order is reversed, and the child 
experiences certain meaning-reactions to which he can assign 
no name. But gradually, through constant effort, the child ac- 
quires in an elementary way a command of oral speech. 
What the home does for the child in an incidental way the 
kindergarten undertakes in a manner that is systematic. Here, 
through plays and games, he is introduced to an ever-increasing 
number of objects and activities of his environment. He plays 
with objects and he plays with other children, and by such 
means he develops as a physical and social being. His training 
through plays and games, however, is not entirely in the direc- 
tion of physical and social development. He acquires at the 
same time, through his physical activity, numerous and varied 
mental reactions,—reactions of meaning,—and he learns to 
designate each with a name. It may be said that the plays and 
games of the kindergarten are as important as means of lan- 
guage development as they are as means of physical and social 
development. And, in addition, the kindergarten makes a spe- 
cial effort in the direction of language development. Through 
stories and songs, recitations and dramatizations, the child adds 
to his stock of meaning-reactions and increases his vocabulary 
and his power of expression. 
It is clear that it has come about not entirely by accident that 
children in civilized countries the world over are started to 
school at the age of six. In the school the child is required to
-P-A-G-E-50
  40 THE TEACHING OF READING 
act as a member of a social group. He must conform to the 
group in a definite and well-ordered way. Directions and com- 
mands as to the manner in which he is to conduct himself are 
therefore necessary. As a means of development he is called 
upon from time to time to answer questions and to express what 
is in his mind. The child of school age must be able to under- 
stand simple directions and to convey his thoughts to others. 
In an elementary way he must have acquired in a preparatory 
period a mastery of oral language. The experience of the race 
is that children generally have this mastery at the age of six 
and not before. 
The child at the age of six is able to acquire a new form of 
speech. The business of learning to read is in the beginning 
the business of attaching meanings to printed symbols. The 
process is suggested and the necessary directions are given by 
the teacher through the medium of oral speech./ {Not until the 
child has acquired a mastery of oral speech is he able to learn a 
new form of speech—written speech, or reading. This he is able 
to undertake at the age of six, for the reason that at that age he 
is able to understand the necessary suggestions and directions 
of the teacher, and he has in his possession, ready to attach 
to the new form of symbol to which he is introduced through 
reading, the necessary and appropriate reactions of meaning. 
The training that is planned for the child of six may be 
entirely in the direction of the further development of his 
ability in oral language, as suggested in the articles of Dewey 
and Patrick; or, as is suggested here, the training may be 
directed toward the development of a new form of language 
through the medium of, and coincident with development in, 
oral language. On the grounds of theory we may conclude that 
the child of six is able to learn to read. On the practical grounds 
of the successful experience of thousands of first-grade teachers 
our conclusion is completely justified. 
Fixed habits of oral speech delay the process of mastering 
written speech. In order that the child may be provided with
-P-A-G-E-51
  WHEN SHALL READING BEGIN? 4I 
the proper background for acquiring in an economical and 
effective way a mastery of the process of reading, Professor 
Patrick recommends that the earlier years of the child’s school 
life be devoted to the development of ability in oral speech: 
More and more attention is given in our elementary schools to the 
subject of language—more, as some think, than the relative impor- 
tance of the subject warrants; but without discussing this question, it 
is indubitably shown by child psychology that it is the spoken language 
which belongs to the elementary school. The ear is the natural medium 
of instruction for young children, and all the second-hand knowledge 
which it is necessary that the child should receive should come to him 
in this way. It should come from the living words of the living teacher 
or parent, not through the cold medium of the printed book. In the 
elementary school, then, the child may be instructed in language as it 
relates to the ear and the tongue, and this is the real language. He may 
be taught to speak accurately and elegantly, and he may be taught to 
listen and remember. He may study in this way the best literature of 
his mother tongue, and get a living, sympathetic knowledge of it, such 
as can never come through the indirect medium of the book. Indeed, 
this language study need not be limited to the mother tongue. There is 
no age when a child may with so great economy of effort gain a lasting 
knowledge of a foreign language as when he is from seven to eleven 
years old. 
When the spoken language has been mastered in this way, and when 
the child has arrived at the reading and writing age, language in its 
written form may be acquired in a very short time, and that which now 
fills so many weary years of school life will sink into the position of 
comparative insignificance in which it rightfully belongs. 
The argument is that through the means here suggested an 
easy road to reading will be opened up for the child in the later 
years of the school. Whether the argument is as sound as it 
may seem plausible is a matter of serious doubt. 
For example, many boys and young men become expert in 
the playing of two or more athletic games. They appear to be

Write,” Popular Science Monthly, Vol. LIV, p. 391.

  42 THE TEACHING OF READING 
equally good in baseball, basketball, tennis, etc. Others are 
expert in the playing of one game, but are mediocre in all 
others. The reasons are that the former group developed skill 
in their various games concurrently ; they developed from un- 
skillful to skillful players in baseball during the same period of 
years as the one in which they were making like progress in 
playing basketball and tennis, whereas the latter group learned 
one game thoroughly by much practice over a period of years, 
and then turned their energy and attention to the learning of 
others. With the former group there was no interference of the 
habits and skills developed in one game with those that were 
being developed in others; with the latter group the habits and 
skills which they had perfected in the one game they could 
play had become so fixed as seriously to retard development of 
the habits and skills necessary for the playing of other games. 
Again, there are children of foreign parents living in this 
country who appear to learn our language and their own mother 
tongue with equal degrees of perfection. The development of 
habits of speech in the one language does not seem to interfere 
with the development of corresponding habits in the other. 
The reason is that the two languages are learned at the same 
time, which renders it impossible for habits in either language 
to reach such a state of fixity (while habits in the other are in 
their incipient stages) as seriously to retard their development. 
On the other hand, adults as a rule find the learning of a foreign 
language an extremely difficult undertaking. It is true that 
they have a better background of English for the learning of a 
foreign language than they possessed as children, and they are 
able to bring to bear upon their study of the foreign tongue 
better methods of attack and usually more effective motives, 
The point is that they are retarded in their study of the foreign 
language because of the fact that they already have developed 
fixed habits of interpretation and expression in the English. 
So it is with the task of learning to read in the primary 
school. If children are started in the subject of reading as soon
-P-A-G-E-53
  WHEN SHALL READING BEGIN? 43 
as they have acquired the necessary amount of preparation in 
oral language, they have the opportunity of making correspond- 
ing and concurrent progress in both oral and written speech. 
That they are able to make such progress the successful experi- 
ence of primary-school teachers will attest. Whereas, if the 
study of reading is delayed, or undertaken in an unsystematic 
way, their habits of oral speech will tend to become so fixed as 
to retard the development of the fundamental habits of written 
speech. The preceding topic made clear that a beginning in 
oral language must be made before the child can be taught to 
read. It is equally true that the study of reading may be 
delayed to the point where the child’s habits of oral speech 
serve as a hindrance rather than as a help. The age of six is the 
crucial age to begin the teaching of reading, because (1) the 
child’s preparation in oral language is sufficient to enable him 
to learn written language; (2) his habits of oral speech have 
not become so fixed as to delay the process of acquiring a com- 
mand of written speech. 
We arrive now at the third point in our argument, which is 
(3) the out-of-school interests of the child of six are not so 
great as to detract considerably from the activities necessary 
to the learning of written language. 
The later interests of children are individual rather than 
social. We may secure an idea of the interests of children of 
the primary grades by way of contrast with those of children 
in the grades that immediately follow. Following the period of 
the primary school, which lasts to the age of nine, comes a 
period in the child’s development which is described in a later 
chapter (Chapter IX) as the period of individualism. This is 
the period from nine to twelve years of age, in which the child 
enters more or less into rebellion against the formal demands of 
the school and becomes something of an individualist in his 
tastes and desires and habits of work. From the standpoint of 
the subject of reading, the child wishes to make use of his 
ability to secure information which immediately interests him
-P-A-G-E-54
44 THE TEACHING OF READING 
  as an individual. He is willing no longer to enter with enthu- 
siasm into the activities that are necessary to acquire a mastery 
of the formal and mechanical phases of the subject. 
Now reading is a mechanical process (as the second part of 
this book will undertake to show) which requires in its mastery 
formal drills in word recognition, in phonics, in word analysis, 
in reading for fluency, even in reading for meaning. In order to 
be effective these drills and exercises must be entered into with 
enthusiasm. For the most part they are, and must be, entered 
into not because they meet any individual need that the child 
can understand, but because the teacher has given directions, 
and in order to do as other children are doing. Consequently if 
these drills and exercises are postponed until the age of nine— 
when the child is willing to engage in reading only for the sake 
of satisfying his cravings for information about interesting 
things—he has a poor chance of ever acquiring skill in the 
mechanics of the subject, which is the necessary prerequisite to 
independent reading for meaning. Reading cannot be post- 
poned until the child wishes to use reading; his interests then 
are too intensely individual to turn to use in mastering the 
mechanics. 
The child from nine to twelve is interested in the concrete 
things of his environment, in romance and adventure, in excit- 
ing activities. If the mechanics of reading have been mastered 
to the point where his interests can be satisfied through reading, 
he is willing to continue in the activities of the subject. On the 
other hand, if a satisfaction of his interests is retarded because 
reading to him presents many features of mechanical difficulty, 
he will turn aside from reading to the concrete activities 
around him. 
The out-of-school interests of the child of six are not so 
intense. Going to school is a new experience with him. All the 
activities of the schoolroom are novelties. Whatever the teacher 
demands of him he enters into with enthusiasm because it is 
something to do and other children are doing it. A word drill or
-P-A-G-E-55
  WHEN SHALL READING BEGIN? 45 
an exercise in oral reading interests him just as much as a game 
of tag, and about as long, because it is an activity different from 
the one which may have preceded it. The interests of the child 
of six, both in and out of school, stand out in sharp contrast 
when we compare them with the interests of the child of nine. 
This brings us to the fourth point in our argument, which lends 
itself further toward making evident the contrast which is here 
indicated. 
The period of the primary school is one of social imitation. 
Professor Judd describes the period of the primary school in the 
following paragraphs: 
At five or six years of age the pupil comes to the primary school. His 
experience is very limited; his senses are open to the impressions of 
color and sound and touch, and he eagerly or timidly mixes in the 
social group which is often to him bewilderingly large and strange. The 
key to the understanding of this period is to be found in the simple 
psychological principle that out of all of the bewildering mass of 
childish experience it is persons who attract the child’s most vivid at- 
tention. The experiences of childhood are to be thought of not as 
meager but as confusing in their abundance. The world is so full of a 
number of things that one hardly knows where to turn. In the mass of 
this experience one turns to some person and follows in a docile way 
the lead of that person. The first grade is a place where children do 
what others do. First-graders are a flock of sheep. The teacher can 
lead them into almost anything because they are eager to do whatever 
they see others do. 
Sometimes this period is described as a period when children are 
absorbed in sense impressions. This statement is true if it means that 
colors and sounds constitute the content of experience. It is false if it 
is meant to teach that little children are absorbed in the study of 
objects. The sounds and colors which hold the attention of primary 
children are those which attach to people. A little child will give up a 
plaything which he has in hand for a less attractive plaything in the 
hands of someone else. Primary children are social creatures first, last, 
and all the time. 
This description of the primary child’s mental attitudes gives us the 
formula for the organization of the primary course of study. There is 
an eager desire on the part of the first-grader to write his name.
-P-A-G-E-56
  
46 THE TEACHING OF READING 
He does not need any artificial stimulation to undertake writing. Other 
people write ; that is enough for him. He is eager to be initiated. Other 
people look into books; he must do the same. The period is not a 
period for nature study in any analytical scientific sense. It is a period 
for social companionships. The primary child likes animals as play- 
things ; he is not interested in studying their structure. Show an animal 
to a little child and let him ask the questions that are in his mind, and 
social questions are the only ones which will come. “Where can I get 
one?” “Will it bite me?” 
The judgment of the race has been right; this is the period for the 
teaching of reading and writing. The oral language which the pupil 
acquires in the pre-school period is the basis on which the primary 
work must be erected. The first reading lessons are lessons in the 
association of known oral symbols with those complicated social 
devices, the printed symbols. The ability to live in society which the 
pupil brings to the first grade must be extended through the mastery 
of language in its written and printed forms. 
The utter absorption of the child of this age in society rather than 
in material things is attested by his credulity for fairy tales, which are 
full of people but are grotesquely impossible in their description of 
material facts. In his eager desire to illustrate every story he hears, 
the child produces drawings which have very little merit as representa- 
tions of things but are often expressive of action in the highest degree. 
A child of this age is keen in his observation of people but neglectful 
of things.t 
The points to be kept in mind are (1) that the child of six 
is very docile, (2) that he is interested in people rather than in 
things, and (3) that he wishes to conform to the customs of 
people by performing the activities—or playing at the activities 
—in which older people engage. 
The child of six undertakes to read through ,compelling 
motives. The critics of early reading argue that the intellectual 
appetite of the child of six is not sufficiently active to warrant 
an attack on the formal and mechanical difficulties of the sub- 
ject (they argue for delay until the time when the child will

-P-A-G-E-57
  WHEN SHALL READING BEGIN? 47 
feel the need of learning to read). They state that such a mo- 
tive is lacking in the early years of the primary-school period. 
With such contentions we can hardly disagree. Indeed, it would 
be more to the point to state that nowhere in the child’s intel- 
lectual growth does he cultivate an appetite for the formal and 
mechanical phases of reading, and that at no period does he 
feel the need of learning to read until he has secured some 
mastery at least of the process itself. It is a mistaken notion 
that impels teachers to attempt on any such basis to develop 
in their pupils a motive for reading. 
That the child of six does have a compelling motive for learn- 
ing to read, the foregoing quoted paragraphs would seem to indi- 
cate. The child is interested in people and in their activities. 
What others do he wishes to be known as being able to do him- 
self. Such activities as he cannot perform he will:pretend to 
perform. He sees an adult driving an automobile or a wagon, 
and he plays at the game of being a chauffeur or a teamster. 
His elders write, and that impels him to undertake some writ- 
ing (?) of his own. His elders read newspapers and books, and 
so he peruses newspapers and books, held upside down or in 
any other convenient manner. The child of six aims to conform 
to the group. He is docile and tractable. He will follow the 
teacher or an older person into any activity that may be sug- 
gested. No reason need be assigned. It is enough to know that 
other people do the same thing; it is enough that the teacher 
has asked it and has pointed out the way. 
Mastering the mechanics of reading is a process without rea- 
son to the one who has never learned to read. The same is true 
of the elementary stages of every subject until the time when 
the elementary stages have been passed. The point for our con- 
sideration is that the process of mastering the mechanics of 
reading does not need to be a reasonable process to the child of 
six. He enters into the activities of the process through the 
influence of a motive that is all-compelling. The motive of the 
six-year-old is the social one—the motive of social imitation.  
-P-A-G-E-58
  48 THE TEACHING OF READING 
The age of six is the crucial age. The child of six has a com- 
mand of oral language that is sufficient to enable him to learn to 
read ; his habits of oral speech have not as yet become so fixed as 
to delay the process of acquiring a command of written speech, 
his out-of-school interests have not as yet become so great as to 
detract considerably from the process of learning to read, and he 
is actuated in all that he undertakes through motives of social 
imitation. The primary teacher has an opportunity to teach chil- 
dren to read that is given to no other teacher. To delay the teach- 
ing of reading until the child’s habits of oral speech have become 
* fixed, until he becomes interested in the concrete world around 
him more than he is interested in people, until he becomes self- 
centered rather than social in his desires and inclinations,— 
indeed, to attempt toteach reading only as an incident in connec- 
tion with other subjects, —isnothingshort of criminal. Itis acrime 
against the child, and, if our conclusions of the preceding chapter 
relative to the importance of reading are correct, it is likewise a 
crime against the State. The teacher of primary children may 
make use of the opportunity offered by their status of intellectual 
development and by their nature as social imitators to give them 
an effective and systematic start in the process of learning to read, 
or the teacher may hesitate for a year or two only to discover 
that the opportunity thus offered has been forever left behind. 
. . . learning to read is no longer the “‘scourge of infancy,” as Rous- 
seau called it in 1762, and as it was in many places even a generation 
ago. Instead, our modern teaching early opens to children the road to 
the fairyland of fable, myth, adventure, and romance as found in the 
world of children’s books. Every step that they take along this road 
under the teacher’s guidance is playful and delightful. At the same 
time each step is a part of a most systematic and progressive scheme 
of learning, all parts of which have been definitely planned in advance. 
Yet so thoroughly are the various teaching processes adapted to the 
children’s instinctive interests and activities that delight in learning 
and systematic progress go hand in hand.t

Summary. The answer of this chapter to the attacks that 
have been directed against the time-honored practice of be- 
ginning to teach reading in the first grade is as follows: 
1. The attacks on early reading have been based on theoreti- 
cal instead of practical grounds. 
2. The attacks appear to be not entirely free from prejudice. 
3. They convert specific criticisms into general ones. 
4. The age of six is the crucial age to begin the teaching of 
reading, because at that age 
a. The child’s preparation in oral language is sufficient to 
enable him to learn written language, or reading. 
6. His habits of oral speech have not become so fixed as to 
delay the process of acquiring a command of written speech. 
c. His out-of-school interests are not so great as to detract 
considerably from the activities necessary to the learning of 
written language. 
d. He is actuated through motives of social imitation.

PART II. THE READING PROCESS 
CHAPTER IV 
THE WORK OF THE EYE IN READING 
  In Chapters I and II of this text we have discussed the aims 
of reading instruction and the importance of reading as a school 
subject. In Chapter III we have decided that reading instruc- 
tion ought to begin in the work of the first grade of school. It is 
important, next, that we study the nature of the reading proc- 
ess. We are obliged to carry on such a study before we are able 
intelligently to devise ways and means of conducting instruc- 
tion in reading. Accordingly the next six chapters are devoted 
to a study of the reading process. The present chapter begins 
the discussion by a study of the work of the eye in reading. A 
study of the reading process may properly begin with a study 
of eye movements, because of all the phases of the process of 
reading, eye movements are most easily observed and records of 
them most readily obtained. 
Experiment. In order to secure an idea of the outstanding 
characteristics of the movement of the eyes in reading, the 
reader is invited to observe carefully the eye movements that 
are made by a friend in the reading of an ordinary prose selec- 
tion. Conduct an experiment as follows: Seat the subject in 
front of a good light. Take your position before him, but 
enough to one side so as not to interfere with the passage of 
light to his eyes. Have him hold the book or other reading 
material slightly below the level of his eyes. With this arrange- 
ment the subject has no trouble in reading the material before 
5° 
 
-P-A-G-E-61
  THE WORK OF THE EYE IN READING 51 
him, and at the same time you (the experimenter) can see 
enough of the eye to observe its movements. It may require a 
little practice to catch the short and rapid eye movements. The 
method is at best only a crude means to an approximate count of 
the movements which are made in reading each line of print. 
The subject should begin at a known place on the page and look 
from the left to the right margin before beginning to read, for 
the purpose of giving you a signal. You should, without taking 
your eyes from the eye of the subject, make note with pencil 
and paper of the number of fixation pauses made in reading each 
line. A frequent source of error is to count the eye movements 
instead of the fixations. This should not be done. The subject 
should read silently and continuously. 
What the experiment shows. If the above experiment is per- 
formed conscientiously by both experimenter and subject, after 
some little practice the following facts become evident: 
1. That the eye moves across the page from left to right in a 
series of sweeps which correspond in number to the number of 
lines read. 
2. That the eye moves along each line from left to right in a 
series of quick, short movements and fixation pauses of short 
duration. 
3. That the eye returns from right to left to the following 
line in one rapid, unbroken sweep. 
4. That the fixation pauses are fairly regular in number from 
line to line for a given individual—three to the line, four to the 
line, five or six to the line, as the case may bé. 
The fact that the eye does not move continuously from left to 
right along the line of print, but in a series of sweeps and fixa- 
tion pauses, is most significant, as we shall presently see. What 
concerns us now is how a record of the number and duration of 
fixation pauses might be taken as a means to a more careful 
study of their meaning. 
Method of recording eye movement. Quite a variety of 
methods of recording the movement of the eyes in reading have
-P-A-G-E-62
    52 THE TEACHING OF READING 
been followed by different experimenters. Perhaps the most 
elaborate and at the same time the most successful method is 
the one which has been in use since 1916 in the School of Edu- 
cation of The University of Chicago. The method consists in 
taking on a moving film a series of pictures of a ray of light 
reflected from the eye during the process of reading. It is 
possible in this manner to secure a record (1) of the exact 
points of fixation; (2) of the number of fixations per line; 
(3) of the duration of the pauses; and (4) of the direction of 
the eye movement, whether forward or backward.t Photo- 
graphic records of these four kinds of data are made (see 
Figs. 2 and 3.) Such photographs provide a very easy ap- 
proach to a study of eye movement in reading. 
Explanation of the figures. Fig. 2 shows the fixation pauses 
of a university student in the graduate department during the 
silent reading of a passage; Fig. 3 shows the fixation pauses 
of the same reader during an oral reading of the passage. 
“Fig. 1 reproduces the passage in 11-point type in the exact 
form in which it was presented to the reader at each reading.” 
Description of Figs. 2 and 3 is made as follows: 
The lines have been separated in the vertical so as to make it easy to 
insert a number of figures and short vertical lines. The short verticals 
indicate in each case a point of fixation. In some cases there are oblique 
or broken lines ; these indicate a slight shift of the eye during fixation. 
The serial numbers above the verticals indicate the order of the pauses ; 
at the lower end of each vertical is a number indicating in fiftieths of a 
second the length of the fixation.?

Characteristics of adult silent reading. Let us study the 
photographic record of eye movement as it is reproduced in 
.Fig. 2. The plate should be interpreted as follows: In a silent 
reading of the printed selection the eyes of the subject fixated 
first at the left of the letter W for forty-five fiftieths of a second ; 
next, slightly to the right of y for eleven fiftieths of a second; 
next, to the left of 7 for seven fiftieths of a second; and so on. 
The first line was read in six fixations, the second line in five, 
When Denny had regained consciousness, and 
everything possible for his comfort and for the as- 
sistance of his distracted mother, had been done; and 
the physician had assured them that the lad would 
be as good as ever in a day or two, the men crossed 
the street to the little white house. 
  Fic. 1. The passage read, showing approximately the spacing between lines and 
the size of letters as used in the experiments 
the third in four, and so on. It is to be noted that the first pause 
in line 1 is for an unusual period of time, and that in the first 
line there is a tendency toward an unusual number of pauses. 
The facts indicate that the reader is consuming considerable 
energy in the process of getting started, and that the results 
shown in line 1 are not characteristic of the redder’s usual per- 
formance. We will therefore omit line 1 from consideration in 
our studies and comparisons. 
In line 2 the first fixation seems sufficient to carry the reader 
over the first word ; pause 2, to carry the reader over the second 
and third words; pause 3, over the fourth, fifth, and sixth 
words ; and pause 4, over the seventh and eighth words. Pause

  56 THE TEACHING OF READING 
5 seems to result from the effort to fit the movement of the eye 
to the material to be read. The pauses in lines 3, 4, and 5 are 
very similar, both in position and length, to the pauses in line 2. 
It would appear that in silent reading the subject has developed 
a certain characteristic eye-movement habit which is fairly uni- 
form from line to line. 
Characteristics of adult oral reading. The record of eye 
movement shown in Fig. 3 is very different from the record 
shown in Fig. 2. Fig. 3 reproduces the record of position and 
duration of eye pauses made by the same subject in an oral 
reading of a selection. When we compare the two records it 
is very easy to be seen that there are considerable differences 
between the movement of an adult’s eyes when he reads orally 
and those he makes when he reads silently. Why are the pauses 
so many more to the line in oral reading than in silent reading? 
Why are the pauses of longer duration? How is the fact ex- 
plained that an experienced reader is able in the silent reading 
of a passage to take into consciousness a whole line of print in 
three or four peeps at the line? What is the explanation of the 
absence of this ability in the oral reading of a passage? These 
are important questions. which following chapters attempt to 
answer. Before we begin to seek the answers to these questions, 
let us consider briefly the characteristic eye-movement habits 
of children in the grades. 
Eye movements of children. Records of the eye movements 
of a good silent reader in each of the third, fourth, sixth, and 
seventh grades are reproduced in Figs. 4-7 respectively. Figs. 8 
and 9 show the records of a poor silent reader in each of 
grades four and seven, respectively. What are the striking 
features of the eye movements of children revealed in these 
records ? 
The first striking feature that attracts our attention is that 
good reading in the lower grades is characterized by a large 
number of pauses per line. The record of the third-grade pupil 
(Fig. 4) shows seven pauses to the line, that of the fourth-
-P-A-G-E-67
THE WORK OF THE EYE IN READING 57 
grade pupil (Fig. 5) six pauses to the line. Our attention is 
called to the fact that in each case there are almost as many 
pauses to the line as there are words in the line. 
A second striking feature of the eye movements of children 
is that progress through the grades is characterized by a con- 
stantly decreasing number of pauses per line. It is to be noted 
that the good reader in the third grade requires as many as 
seven fixations in order to recognize the words in the line, the 
fourth-grade reader six, the sixth-grade reader five, and that 
the seventh-grade reader is able to read a whole line in only 
four fixations. 
A third characteristic may be noticed if we turn back to 
Fig. 3 and compare the oral-reading record of an adult with 
the silent-reading records of a good reader in the third grade 
(Fig. 4) and of a poor reader in the upper grades (Fig. 9). 
The similarity of the three records is very striking. The adult, 
in his oral reading, fixates a word at a time; so does the good 
silent reader of the third grade; so does the poor silent reader 
of the seventh grade. 
A fourth characteristic reveals itself in a study of the records 
of the two poor readers (Figs. 8 and 9). Here we note the 
unusual number of pauses to the line and the extreme length 
of some of the pauses. What is more important for our con- 
sideration, however, is the fact that the eyes of the poor readers 
do not always move straight ahead, but that there is a consider- 
able amount of regressive movement of the eyes along with the 
usual forward movement. 
Explanation of characteristics to appear in later discussions. 
The discussion of the four characteristics of the eye movements 
of children raise a number of questions in our minds. How are 
all these interesting facts which relate to the eye movement of 
children and of adults as well to be explained? Following 
chapters are concerned with providing answers to this question. 
Chapter V, “The Nature of Recognition,” offers an explanation 
of the fact that a whole line of print can be taken into the con-

sciousness of the reader in a few peeps at the line; Chapters 
VI and VII, “The Balance between Mechanics and Meaning,” 
discuss the significance of regressive movements on the part of 
poor readers; Chapter VIII, “The Balance between Speed and 
Comprehension,” continues the discussion of Chapters VI and 
VII; and in Chapter IX, “Oral and Silent Reading,” we find a 
discussion of the characteristic differences between the eye- 
movement habits that are developed in oral reading and those 
that are developed in silent reading. 
As an introduction to the chapter which immediately follows, 
we need now to consider briefly two very important facts of 
vision; namely, (1) that the eye sees only when it is at rest, or 
fixated, and (2) that the limit of distinct vision is very small. 
The eye sees only when at rest. That the eye does not see 
when it is moving from one point of fixation to another may be 
demonstrated by a very simple experiment. Let the reader look 
at one corner of his room, then shift the eyes to another corner, 
taking particular pains not to allow the eyes to fixate any inter- 
vening object while the shift is being made. One becomes aware 
at least that very little can be seen between one point of fixation 
and another. Again, one may look at the image of his eyes in a 
mirror, the while making slight shifts by looking first at the 
image of one eye, then at the image of the other, in the effort to 
detect any movement. No movement of the eyes can be noticed. 
Or, again, one may try to see the individual spokes of a slowly 
moving wheel. Only a blur can be seen, unless for an instant the 
eye fixates a single spoke by following it for a short space in 
its revolution. 
The evidence which has just been presented is, of course, not 
entirely conclusive. Of how little importance, however, is eye 
movement so far as vision is concerned, as compared with fixa- 
tion, one can very readily satisfy himself by comparing the 
amount of time consumed by each process in reading. Eye 
movement is practically instantaneous; about one fiftieth of a 
second is consumed in traveling from one point of fixation to  
-P-A-G-E-71
THE WORK OF THE EYE IN READING 61 
another. Turning back to Fig. 2 we find the adult reader 
consuming about fourteen times this length of time on the aver- 
age at each of his fixation pauses. The question whether per- 
ception takes place during eye movement has been very fully 
discussed by a number of experimenters. The preponderance 
of evidence leads to the conclusion that there is no perception 
during movement. 
The limit of distinct vision is small. The second important 
fact of vision, that the limit of distinct vision is very small, can be 
understood if we note the physical structure of the retina — that 
part of the eye upon which impressions of visual stimuli are made. 
There is in the back part of the retina a little depression called 
the fovea, in which is closely packed a large number of cones. * 
Beyond this area are found both rods and cones, the percentage 
in the number of rods increasing and that of the cones decreas- 
ing as the distance toward the outer areas, or periphery, of the 
retina becomes greater. These rods and cones are highly devel- 
oped nerve cells which are specialized for the reception of light 
stimulations. They have different functions : both are sensitive to 
light impressions ; the cones alone are useful for distinct vision. 
It is evident that the area of distinct vision is defined by the 
area of the depression in the retina which is made up exclusively 
of cones. Its area is about one fifth of a millimeter in diameter, 
and includes about three fourths of a degree of the retinal 
image, which corresponds (for ordinary type at the usual dis- 
tance from the eye for reading) to no more than three or four 
letters. The eye, of course, sees more than this amount ; three or 
four letters are all that can be seen distinctly. Beyond this limit 
of distinct vision the retinal image becomes less and less dis- 
tinct, and only the outstanding characteristics of letters, words, 
and objects can be seen, and they more and more faintly as the 
distance from the point of fixation increases. Huey describes 
such a retinal image in the following paragraph: 
1E. B. Huey, The Psychology and Pedagogy of Reading, p. 34. The Mac- 
millan Company, New York, 1915.
-P-A-G-E-72
  62 THE TEACHING OF READING 
As we leave the fovea there is a marked decrease in the distinctness 
of the image, a gradual blurring and losing of details, due to the fast- 
diminishing number of sensitive retinal elements. Only the larger and 
larger figures of the picture appear as we go farther, and finally only 
the most general outlines of even the forms that are of considerable 
size are evident in the extreme outer parts. It is somewhat as though 
our camera plate were comparatively perfect within a very small circle 
at the center, but were perforated from this outward to form a sensi- 
tive netting having larger and larger meshes toward the edges of the 
plate. A print from such a negative would give some suggestion of the 
character of the retinal picture, and would be called exceedingly defec- 
tive as a photograph.t 
The limit of distinct vision appears to be large. The limit 
of distinct vision, thus defined, is somewhat at variance with 
what, as a result of our experience, we would be willing to con- 
cede as a limit. When we fixate a given point on a page of print, 
we are quite sure that we can see distinctly considerably more 
than three or four letters. This is to be explained in part by the 
fact that the rods which are located without the fovea are just 
as sensitive to different degrees of brightness as the cones which 
are included within the fovea. Thus, when we fixate the middle 
of a line of print, the differences between the white of the page 
and the black of the print appear about equally as distinct on 
the outer limits of the line as at the point of fixation, and we 
experience the illusion of all parts of the line appearing about 
equally distinct. In addition, our inability to keep the eye 
fixated at a given point longer than a moment serves as a par- 
tial explanation. If the reader will attempt to fixate his eyes for 
a few seconds on a given letter on the page, he will discover that 
it is an extremely difficult task to keep his eyes from turning 
to letters close by, then back to the letter he is fixating. The 
eyes are constantly in motion. Even when we are earnest in the 
attempt to hold them fixated at a given point, they are making 
slight movements back and forth to all points in the immediate

neighborhood without our being at all conscious of any move- 
ment’s taking place. Consequently, what we think we see dis- 
tinctly at one fixation is really the amount we see distinctly at 
several fixations. 
Summary. The present chapter introduces us to the prob- 
lems which are to be discussed in later chapters. In it we have 
secured an introduction (1) to the characteristic movement of 
the eyes in reading, (2) to the contrasting features of the eye- 
movement habits that are developed in silent reading with those 
that are developed in oral reading, and (3) to the important 
characteristics of the eye-movement habits of good and poor 
silent readers in the various grades of the school.- The chapter 
closes with a discussion of two important facts of vision; 
namely, (1) that the eye sees only when it is at rest, or fixated, 
and (2) that the limit of distinct vision is very small. 
A number of photographicplates containing the eye-movement 
records of variousreaders are reproduced throughout the chapter, 
to which constant reference is made in the chapters which im- 
mediately follow. The reader should thoroughly familiarize 
himself with these records, and turn to them quite frequently 
as a source of light on later discussions.

CHAPTER V 
THE NATURE OF RECOGNITION 
I. THE PROCESS 
The former conception emphasized the importance of letters. 
It was formerly believed, as it is quite commonly believed to- 
day, that recognition in reading proceeds letter by letter. The 
eyes, one might be told, move across the line of print in a con- 
tinuous, steady movement, noting each letter separately, but 
doing it so rapidly that the letters fuse themselves into words 
in our minds without our being at all conscious of the process. 
A word is determined by its constituent letters; therefore it is 
necessary for the eye to take in and the mind to relate each 
letter as it appears in the word, before recognition of the word 
is complete. Words are spelled letter by letter; they are written 
letter by letter; naturally, the argument might run, they are 
recognized and read letter by letter. The argument is very 
plausible. There is not a doubt that behind some such an argu- 
ment the old alphabet method of teaching children to read 
defended itself for so long a time in educational practice. 
“From simple to complex” was the dominant principle. The 
alphabet method of teaching children to read was logically the 
first and only method of earlier pedagogical practice. A later 
chapter, “The Development of Modern Methods in Reading,” 
will treat of it in some detail. For our present purpose it is 
enough to examine briefly the underlying principle of the 
method. The writings of Pestalozzi provide for us the most evi- 
dent clue to an understanding of the reason why the alphabet 
method continued for so long a time to be the only one devised 
by the minds of teachers of children. 
64
-P-A-G-E-75
THE NATURE OF RECOGNITION 65 
Pestalozzi, fired by the “Emile” of the visionary, Rousseau, 
decided, as he said, “to psychologize teaching” and to ar- 
range the order of topics in each subject and present them in 
the way by which pupils can learn them best. In order to carry 
out his designs he adopted and followed to the letter that prin- 
ciple of method which had always been dominant in the teach- 
ing of reading. All teaching was to “proceed from the simple to 
* the complex.” The manner in which such an apparently harm- 
less principle led Pestalozzi astray in the teaching of reading, 
as well as in the teaching of other subjects, is illustrated in the 
following quotations from his writings: 
I once more began crying my A B C’s from morning to night... . 1] 
was indefatigable in putting syllables together and arranging them in a 
graduated series. I did the same for numbers; I filled whole notebooks 
with them ; I sought by every means to simplify the elements of reading 
and arithmetic, and by grouping them psychologically [to] enable the 
child to pass easily and surely from the first step to the second, from 
the second to the third, and so on. The pupils no longer drew letters on 
their slates, but lines, curves, angles, and squares. 
In every branch of popular knowledge or talent, I set to work to 
organize a graduated series of exercises, the starting point of which 
was within everybody’s comprehension, and the unbroken action of 
which, always exercising the child’s powers without exhausting them, 
resulted in a continuous, easy, and attractive progress. 
The spelling book must contain the entire range of sounds of which 
the language consists, and portions of it should be repeated daily in 
every family. . . . No one imagines to what a degree the attention of 
infants is aroused by the repetition of such simple sounds as ba, ba, ba, 
da, da, da, ma, ma, ma, la, la, la.* 
Thus we see that to Pestalozzi and to the pedagogues of a 
former day “from simple to complex” meant to start with the 
letter and proceed to the syllable, word, phrase, and sentence. 
To them the letter and the syllable were the simple elements; 
the word, the phrase, and the sentence the complex.

66 THE TEACHING OF READING 
The present conception emphasizes the importance of words 
and phrases. Students of education are coming to believe that 
the old and still somewhat common idea of recognition is entirely 
wrong. The careful reader of the preceding chapter cannot but 
be convinced that recognition in reading can and does proceed 
in a way that is more rapid and comprehensive than letter by 
letter. The present conception of recognition is that it proceeds 
not letter by letter but in word-wholes, in phrase-wholes, and 
sometimes even in sentence-wholes. In support of this concep- 
tion let us review, first, the records of eye movement in reading 
which were presented in the preceding chapter; secondly, the 
findings of certain experimenters who have carried on investiga- 
tions in the subject of recognition. ; 
Records of eye movement. The records of eye movement 
which were presented in the preceding chapter reveal facts of 
recognition which stand out in most striking contradiction to 
the former letter-by-letter conception of the process. Let us 
turn back to a typical record, Fig. 2, for example. Here we 
find an adult silent reader taking into consciousness from one to 
four words at a single peep at the line. Since there is no percep- 
tion in eye movement from pause to pause, as it was pointed out 
in a preceding discussion, we are obliged to conclude that the 
whole of perception, or recognition, takes place during the time 
consumed in the reading pauses. A mathematical division of a 
given line into as many parts as there are pauses in the line is 
conclusive that the reader’s span of recognition is of an extent 
sufficient to cover the space of several letters. In line 2, for 
example, we note that the span of recognition is able to compass 
words and groups of words which are made up of six to thirteen 
letters. In lines 2 to 6, inclusive, forty-six words are read 
in twenty-two fixation pauses. That is to say, recognition is 
proceeding at the average rate of slightly more than two words 
at atime. It is not difficult for us to draw a conclusion from 
such a record.

In like manner the records of the eye movements of children, 
shown in Figs. 4-7, point to very definite conclusions. The 
important facts of the four records are summarized in Table I. 
The most significant data are to be found in the fifth, sixth, and 
seventh columns of the table. An examination of these data 
leads one to the conclusion that the former letter-by-letter con- 
ception of recognition is very erroneous. The development of 
the span of recognition, which is indicated in the increase in the 
average number of letters and words recognized per reading 
pause, is brought to our attention in a very striking way. We 
are led to the additional conclusion that as the child reader 
approaches maturity he becomes capable of recognizing in 
larger and larger units. 
Records of short exposure of words. The process of recogni- 
tion may be studied by the so-called short-exposure method. 
The method, in brief, is as follows: The subject is caused to 
fixate a given point in a rectangular blank space. Within this 
blank space, by means of a specially designed apparatus, letters, 
words, phrases, etc. are momentarily exposed._The subject en- 
deavors to recognize as much as he can at each exposure. Part 
of the findings of two experimenters, Erdmann and Dodge, is 
summarized by Huey in the following paragraph:
-P-A-G-E-78
  68 THE TEACHING OF READING 
‘Erdmann and Dodge argue strongly for the theory of perception in 
word-wholes,on the basis of numerous and varied experiments. .. . 
They base their argument mainly upon the following facts: First, words 
are recognized when lying too far from the fixation point to permit 
recognition of their component letters. Second, words are recognized 
when formed of letters so small that the letters could not be singly 
identified. Third, in about half the cases tried, words were recognized at 
distances at which the letters, when singly exposed, could not be recog- 
nized. Fourth, in the latter experiment the words were more readily 
recognized when they were long, or of optically characteristic form. 
Fifth, when twenty-six selected words were learned thoroughly in a 
fixed order, as the alphabet is known, and then exposed beyond the 
distances at which the letters could be recognized, the words could be 
distinguished and recognized in almost every instance. Sixth, words of 
four letters are named somewhat more quickly than single letters, and 
words of eight, twelve, and sixteen letters need comparatively little 
more time, the longest words needing only about one fifth more time 
than the shortest.* 
Erdmann and Dodge point out that it is not the constituent parts 
of any given form that make it recognizable, but it is the familiar total 
arrangement. 
The facts which are now before us are quite conclusive that 
recognition in reading proceeds in word-wholes and phrase- 
wholes. They appear so conclusive even as to contradict one of 
the important facts of vision, which was discussed in the preced- 
ing chapter, that the limit of distinct vision is so small as to 
include no more than three or four letters. The careful reader 
of the preceding chapter no doubt has already encountered in 
his own mind the problem of bringing this fact of vision into 
agreement with the facts of recognition which have been dis- 
cussed. The apparent disagreement between these two seem- 
ingly contradictory sets of facts introduces us now to one of 
the most important discussions of the present chapter; namely, 
that the mind supplies what the eye fails to behold.

THE NATURE OF RECOGNITION 69 
II. CHARACTERISTICS 
The eye notes the general outline; the mind supplies the 
details. As the eye in reading moves from fixation pause to 
fixation pause, the successive impressions which leave their 
records on the retina to be reported by the optic nerve to the 
visual centers of the brain ‘are very defective as photographs. 
About three letters in the center of each retinal image stand 
out with any degree of clearness; the rest on either side of the 
center are less and less distinct as the distance to the limits of 
the recognition span becomes greater. If we put together the 
facts of eye movement, as revealed in the records of duration 
and number per line of the reading pauses, with the facts of 
vision, we shall become aware that only very indistinct retinal 
pictures of the words in a line are needed by the mature reader 
in order to set going the process of recognition. The eye is able 
to behold only the outstanding characteristics, the striking 
forms, the dominant features, of letters, words, and phrases. 
We shall see that these are all that the mind requires of the 
eye; indeed, all the raw material of sensation that the mind 
needs in order to perform its proper function as an agent of 
recognition. Whatever of detail is necessary in order to com- 
plete the very inadequate retinal photographs the mind is able 
to supply, and does. 
Examples. If we glance at a familiar landscape, we are able 
to recognize it immediately. The one glance seems sufficient to 
produce a mental picture of the landscape in all its detail—the 
general contour of the land, the position of every tree and 
shrub, paths and roadways, rocks and grassy knolls. A closer 
examination of the landscape will reveal a.number of details 
which we were quite sure we had seen at the first glance. Yet 
if we are questioned regarding the landscape immediately after 
the first glance, we can be absolutely sure of having seen only a 
few of its details. Regarding many of the more familiar details, 
we are not able to tell exactly whether we have just seen them  
-P-A-G-E-80
  70 THE TEACHING OF READING 
or are having them pictured for us in our “mind’s eye.” Indeed, 
a second glance will often reveal a number of details which we 
were quite sure we had seen at the first glance, greatly altered 
and some entirely disappeared. 
Again, the mind does not require any great amount of sen- 
sory experience in order to enable us to recognize a friend. A 
mere glimpse of him in passing, the sound of his footsteps, an 
’ insignificant mannerism—any of these is sufficient sensory 
material to enable us to recognize him and to be just as sure of 
our judgment as we should be had we met him face to face and 
had we scrutinized his appearance in greatest detail. Some one 
thing about his general appearance, some especial peculiarity 
or mannerism, is sufficient to set going the process of recogni- 
tion. In like manner we may see a building in the distance and 
recognize it as being a house because of one distinguishing 
feature—smoke rising from a particular corner, for example. 
This is sufficient sensory material to result in recognition. It 
is not necessary for us to be able to see a single window or door. 
The reading of the blind as an illustration. The reading of 
the blind is a frequently quoted illustration of the general 
character of recognition. In the Braille system of printing the 
letters of the alphabet are represented by tangible points and 
dots raised above the page. A practiced reader of these raised- 
letter pages goes ahead with the fingers of his right hand to ex- 
amine the total form, or general outline, of the word. The fingers 
of the left hand follow, moving successively over the letters in 
order to sense the details of each word. However, only a part of 
the letters are examined, while the fingers move over the others 
without touching the points. Thus only a part of the letters are 
read; the rest are conjectured. Thus the blind need to sense 
only a part of the details of a word in order to recognize it. 
A mistake in reading as an illustration. Professor Parker re- 
ports the following incident from his own personal experience 
to illustrate the influence of a person’s frame of mind in deter- 
mining his response to a situation: 
 
-P-A-G-E-81
THE NATURE OF RECOGNITION 71 
I was riding in a train and happened to look over the shoulder of 
the man in front of me at the newspaper he was reading. I could just 
see the top of the paper and read there the following large headline, 
extending clear across the page: 
GOOD HATS A QUARTER 
Inasmuch as I always take advantage of end-of-the-season reduction 
sales of men’s furnishings, this statement interested me (although good 
hats for a quarter seemed impossible) and I decided to look into the 
matter further when I got a chance. Soon the man left his seat to go 
into the smoking car. I picked up the paper and, turning to the desired 
page, found that instead of reading 
GOOD HATS A QUARTER 
the headline read 
GOD HATES A QUITTER 
It was Monday morning and the paper in question contained re- 
ports of Sunday sermons printed with large-type headlines running 
clear across the page. If I had been in the religious frame of mind, 
instead of the bargain-hunting frame of mind, I might have read the 
headline correctly at the first glance.t 
The results of an experiment to illustrate the characteristics 
of recognition. In his “Experimental Education” Professor 
freeman? describes and reports the results of a study of the 
perceptual process in reading by the short-exposure method. The 
method was, to quote from the report, “used to study the dif- 
ference in fusion in the recognition of different kinds of mate- 
rial, on the assumption that the greater the fusion between the 
elements of the perception the greater will be the amount 
which can be recognized in a given exposure, or the fewer will 
be the number of exposures necessary to recognize the whole.” 
In accordance with this assumption the results were made com-

parable “by dividing in each case the number of objects (let- 
ters or digits) exposed by the number of exposures necessary to 
recognize them, to give what we may for convenience call the 
average number of objects recognized per exposure. The larger 
this number the greater we may assume the fusion among the 
objects to have been.” Each kind of reading material was mo- 
mentarily exposed a sufficient number of times to enable the 
subject to be sure he had recognized it. The study is made up 
of four parts. 
Part I compares the “amount of fusion which exists in the 
recognition of groups of digits and groups of the same number 
of letters in short words.” The number 824397 is an example of 
the groups of digits; “travel,” “factor,” are examples of the 
words. 
Part II is a comparison “between groups of nonsense sylla- 
bles and groups of short words arranged in a sentence and 
containing approximately the same number of letters.” “Gup 
faj rud fon sil” illustrates the groups of nonsense syllables. 
“There are two left” illustrates the short sentences. 
Part III is a comparison “between the recognition of un- 
familiar and familiar words.” Unfamiliar words, such as 
“tachistoscopic” and “eudemonistic,” were exposed; words 
like “governmental” and “transcontinental” represent the fa- 
miliar words. 
Part IV is a study of the “proofreader’s fallacy”; that is, 
the neglect of errors in words. “The existence of this neglect is 
an evidence of fusion or recognition of the group as a whole, 
rather than of each unit for itself.” In the performance of the 
experiment the subjects did not know what words contained 
errors, nor were they required to detect them or to make any 
special effort to recognize details. Words like the following 
were exposed : “education,” “improtant,” “measuded,” “ortho- 
dox,” “carruage,” “argument.” 
Freeman reports the results which were obtained in each 
part of the study by eighteen individuals, Only the average

misspellings, in Part IV and of the words of nearly equal length 
in Part I attracts the attention with equal force. We are now 
in a position which warrants the statement of certain general 
conclusions relative to the characteristics of recognition. These 
conclusions have their basis in the illustrations which are quoted 
above and in the discussions which precede them. They are 
as follows: 
1. Recognition is a mental act. 
2. Recognition is capable of being improved through training. 
3. The mind does not require sensory stimulations to be 
complete. 
4. The mind supplies what the eye fails to behold. 
Let us consider each conclusion briefly in turn.
-P-A-G-E-84
  74 THE TEACHING OF READING 
Recognition is a mental act. Recognition is an act, a thing 
that we do, a mental process; literally, a second cognition. 
When recognition takes places we actively identify a thing that 
we sense as being something, or as belonging to something, 
with which we are already acquainted. Accordingly not all sen- 
sations result in recognition. Only as we turn our attention, or 
as our attention is attracted, to given sensations does recogni- 
tion take place. Not all sounds are identified, for example, 
when our attention is occupied with the reading of an interest- 
ing story; likewise, when we are busily engaged in conversa- 
tion many things that we see pass without being recognized. 
here must be an active movement of the mind in order to 
produce recognitio 
Recognition is capable of being improved through training. 
Since recognition is an act, it is, like all other things that we do, 
performed more easily with each repetition of the act. In 
order to recognize an unfamiliar word considerable energy has 
to be expended (see results of the experiment in recognition of 
familiar and unfamiliar words in Table II, Part III). The first 
few times we see the word “tachistoscope,” for example, we 
encounter considerable difficulty in recognizing it. However, 
when we come to know “tachistoscope” as being the name of a 
piece of laboratory apparatus constructed for the momentary 
exposure of reading material; when we have met “tachisto- 
scope” time after time in the articles we read; in short, when 
we have performed the act of recognizing “tachistoscope” a 
number of times we find that we experience very little if any 
difficulty in recognizing the word. In like manner “transcon- 
tinental” is a very easy word for us and a very difficult one for 
the sixth-grade pupil. The reason is that we have performed 
the process of recognizing the word dozens of times, whereas the 
sixth-grade pupil may not have met the word in his reading 
more than once or twice. 
In order to acquire any degree of skill in the performance 
of a physical act, like riding a bicycle, skating, playing tennis, 
 
-P-A-G-E-85
THE NATURE OF RECOGNITION 75 
learning to typewrite, etc., one must have considerable practice. 
Practice is just as important for the acquirement of skill in the 
performance of a mental act. Efficiency in the recognition of 
words in one’s reading is the result only of repetition and drill. 
The principle thus laid down will be the basis of the practical 
discussions of later chapters. 
The mind does not require sensory stimulations to be com- 
plete. As recognition develops by practice into a more and more 
complex act, it becomes capable of being set off by relatively 
insignificant sensory cues. Our friend’s manner of walk en- 
abling recognition, the general contour of the ground indicating 
a familiar landscape, and smoke rising from a distant object 
identifying a building as a house are examples of single con- 
sciousness cues. Just as the sight of the game for the hunter 
is a sufficient cue to set going the very complex act of bringing 
the gun to position, aiming, allowing for the distance and speed 
of the game, and pulling the trigger, so certain minor details 
of word-form and phrase-form are sufficient cues to set going 
the recognition of these words and phrases, with a minimum 
of consciousness concerning details. 
Tt is true that the recognition of an unfamiliar object has to 
proceed by a close examination of details! For example, the 
more unfamiliar a word.is the more the recognition of it has to 
proceed letter by letter. It is just as true that as the familiarity 
of a word increases, as a result of practice, fewer and fewer 
sensory cues suffice to touch off the process of recognition, the 
tendency being toward reading in word-wholes. 
The sensory cues that result in the recognition of words by 
the mature reader are the familiar total forms of the words 
and the presence of certain dominant, or distinguishing, letters. 
A reference to the results of the experiment in the recognition 
of words, including misspellings, in Table II, Part IV, is a 
reminder that the letters of a word may be interchanged or 
altered without causing any interference with the process of 
recognition, so long as the familiar total form of the word is  
-P-A-G-E-86
  76 THE TEACHING OF READING 
preserved. Likewise, considerable influence as sensory cues has 
very frequently been ascribed to the presence of characteristic, 
determining, or dominant letters. The letters c-nt-r suffice for 
center; m-k-do for mikado; ch---ty for charity; etc. Consid- 
erable discussion has been carried on as to the relative impor- 
tance of the two kinds of cues in word recognition. Since the 
controversy does not add anything to our discussion on the 
practical side, we may leave it with the conclusion that the two 
sets of cues are interdependent. The presence and arrange- 
ment of characteristic, dominant letters determine the familiar 
total form, and the sensing of the familiar total form leads to 
recognition. 
The mind supplies what the eye fails to behold. Recognition 
involves a filling in by the mind of the necessary details to 
complete the very inadequate sensory photographs produced 
upon the retina. It is a projection outward of a mental picture 
as a result of a sensory stimulation. Just as it is possible for 
us to reconstruct in our mind’s eye a mental picture of the 
appearance of any of our large stock of familiar words, as we 
may choose to think of them one at a time, so do we actually 
reconstruct in our mind’s eye the appearance of familiar words 
as a result of the very inadequate retinal images that are re- 
ported to the visual centers of the brain during the process of 
reading. Words with letters interchanged or altered or omitted 
are reconstructed in complete and correct detail. Often, as in 
the reading of 
GOOD HATS A QUARTER 
instead of 
GOD HATES A QUITTER 
the reader is led into considerable error by the pronounced 
activity of the mind in reconstructing what is in the mind in 
preference to what provides the retinal picture. In any case 
recognition is just as much a product of the things already in 
the mind as it is of the excitations and stimuli received from 
the outside, physical world.
-P-A-G-E-87
    
THE NATURE OF RECOGNITION U7. 
Again, perception is always a projection or localization outward of a 
consciousness which is aroused or suggested by the stimulations that 
have come inward, but which is conditioned strongly, also, from within. 
We have seen how, when some dominant parts of a word or sentence 
were exposed without the other parts, the reader would project the 
absent letters upon the page and would “see” them as distinctly as when 
they were actually before him. We have seen, too, how in every moment 
of our reading we project letters and parts of letters to fill up the gaps 
that are always left in the peripheral parts of our retinal image. We 
know how we project a consciousness content to serve for what should 
be imaged on the “blind spot.” Such projection is as certain and as 
common as is any mental phenomenon. The simple fact is that the words 
and all the other objects that we ever see are thus thrown outward, pro- 
jected upon a page in the case of reading, somewhat as a lantern might 
throw them outward upon a screen. In the case of perception it might 
be said that the mind furnishes the screen as well. It must be remem- 
bered that consciousness does not dwell in the retina or in retinal images. 
Objects may be pictured very well without any retina or optic nerve. 
For our purposes here consciousness may best be thought of as in the 
brain, totally in the dark as to physical environment, constructing even 
its light as well as its forms and meanings according to the excitations 
that come in to it and their relations with those that have previously 
come in.t . t 
Il. PRACTICAL CONCLUSIONS 
The foregoing discussion has culminated in a general state- 
ment of the characteristics of recognition. It is important for 
us to’consider now for a time the practical application to read- 
ing of the more or less theoretical discussion of the pages just 
preceding. Our purpose shall be to determine and to state 
such important general principles which underlie the teaching 
of reading as we may find a basis for in the first and second 
divisions of this chapter, reserving for another part of this 
book the working out of the specific devices and details of 
instruction.

  78 THE TEACHING OF READING 
Words, not letters, provide the logical starting point in teach- 
ing to read. The foregoing discussion has made clear that the 
alphabet method of teaching to read falls far short of reaching 
the aim of Pestalozzi when he started out to “psychologize 
teaching.” Pestalozzi’s mistake, we can quite readily see, was 
that he focused his attention wholly upon the working out of a 
logical organization of the subject, forgetting the while to 
consider the way children learn the subject and the use they 
make of it when learned. Thinking wholly in terms of the 
subject, the organization of reading from letter to syllable, 
from syllable to word, and from word to phrase, is the logical, 
“from simple to complex” scheme of organization; thinking in 
terms of children who are learning to read, and of children and 
adults who make use of reading, it falls far short of being 
logical.. We have seen that recognition in reading does not 
proceed letter by letter—indeed, that individual letters are 
scarcely of more importance in word recognition than the indi- 
vidual buds on a rosebush in enabling us to recognize it as a 
rosebush ; that recognition depends upon the familiar total form 
of the word or object. Such being the case, we are entirely 
justified in arriving at the general conclusion that familiarity 
with words in their total form is the first aim of the teacher 
who would teach children to read. 
Analysis of words into letter-elements and sound-elements 
must not be ready-made for the learner. In adopting for our 
guidance the general conclusion that familiarity with words as 
wholes is the starting point of children in learning to read we 
must not lose sight of the importance of word analysis into its 
constituent elements—letters and sounds. The need for carrying 
on such work in the early years of the school is emphasized in 
the chapter immediately following. It is stated further in the 
chapter which follows that analysis has a purpose not for its 
own sake, but for the sake of leading the pupil to an independ- 
ent recognition of new and difficult words. Reserving for the 
next chapter a reasonably full statement of the whole matter,
-P-A-G-E-89
    
THE NATURE OF RECOGNITION 79 
we are at liberty here, on the basis of the discussion of the 
present chapter, only to state that children do not learn to 
read by being fed in regular order the elements of word and 
phrase situations—letters and sounds—by someone else who 
has dug them out, but by meeting the word and phrase situa- 
tions first as complex wholes and afterwards carrying on by 
themselves under the guidance of the teacher what analysis is 
necessary for further progress. 
In the writing of words and in learning to spell, it is necessary 
for the pupil to scrutinize the make-up of each word very care- 
fully and to be familiar with it in complete detail. In the recog- 
nition of words in reading, however, minute analysis is wholly 
unnecessary. The following quotation points out that subject 
matter, now psychologically organized, begins with wholes: 
. + . great modern psychologists, such as William James, describe 
learning mot in terms of proceeding from the simple to the complex, 
but in terms of the learner’s meeting more or less complex objects or 
situations and analyzing these as far as may be necessary for practical 
behavior. This account of the learning process is having large influence 
in changing the organization of subject matter. For example, since 
children can easily recognize as wholes such statements as ‘‘We have 
two pets” or “They are white mice,” such short sentences may be 
used in beginning reading, instead of beginning with letters or syllables. 
This process is described in one of the current manuals of a com- 
mercialized reading system in the following terms, which clearly reflect 
James’s influence : 
Wholes to Parts, to Wholes —The vague whole [namely, the story of Little 
Bo Peep or of Jack Horner] is acquired by the children through listening to 
the story told by the teacher, and through the exercise of their own self- 
activity in dramatization. The story is first analyzed into thought groups. 
The thought groups are then built up synthetically by the teacher, sentence 
by sentence, at the blackboard. Word groups and sight words are taken from 
the sentences. Selected words are separated into phonograms. Phonograms 
are blended to form words. The final step is the reading of the whole story 
from the book.1

  80 THE TEACHING OF READING 
Considerable practice is necessary in order to make recogni- 
tion rapid and easy. It is necessary here to do no more than to 
state this general principle. Enough of discussion for our present 
purpose was included in the discussion of the second charac- 
teristic of recognition. Skill in reading is not unlike any other 
skill in the respect that it requires practice in proportion to the 
degree of proficiency one expects to attain. 
Reading material must be easy and its content not difficult to 
understand. This general principle has its basis in the second 
characteristic of recognition discussed above and in the prin- 
ciples governing effective drill. We may secure an idea of the 
necessity for such a principle operating in the teaching of 
reading by considering briefly the effects of difficult reading 
material and hard content upon the development of reading 
habits. 
When a pupil in the lower grades undertakes the task of 
reading a selection which is hard to understand and which is 
made up of relatively unfamiliar words and phrases, his ex- 
perience is the same as that of every other person who would 
undertake a similar task. The reading proceeds very slowly and 
laboriously, and recognition tends to proceed letter by letter in- 
stead of a word or a familiar phrase at a time. The reading 
habits thus developed are decidedly bad, and continued prog- 
ress toward the goal of effective rapid silent reading is very 
materially hindered. For the sake, then, of developing good 
reading habits the reading material and its content must be of 
such nature as to cause little interruption in the reading process. 
Of course pupils should develop the ability to read more and 
more difficult selections ; numerous occasions in school demand 
the close study of difficult assignments. The answer to the 
first concession is that pupils have little chance of attaining the 
required ability by carrying on reading work which leads to 
the development of inferior reading habits. To the second con- 
cession the answer may be given that the purpose of reading 
lessons and exercises is to develop a particular skill which may 
.
-P-A-G-E-91
  THE NATURE OF RECOGNITION 81 
be used later in mastering difficult content ; that the mastering 
of difficult content is the purpose of geography lessons, history 
lessons, nature-study lessons, etc., not of reading lessons. 
The content of reading material must appeal to the instinc- 
tive interests of pupils. Recognition has been defined as a men- 
tal act requiring the active turning or the passive attracting 
of one’s attention to the identification of certain sensory stimu- 
lations. We are aware, as a result of our own experience, that 
the staring at a page of print the while we are thinking of some- 
thing else does not result in the recognition of the words on the 
page. Only as we set ourselves to the task of reading—that is, 
actively turn our attention to, or have our attention attracted 
by, the contents of the page—do we succeed in performing the 
process of recognition which is necessary for reading. We 
should be increasingly aware of the futility of expecting a 
pupil to receive training in recognition by carrying on the 
process of calling the words on a page under the promptings of 
the teacher or of another pupil. We should recognize the mag- 
nitude of the wasted effort of the pupil who finds the content 
of his reading of no greater interest than to permit him to 
travel the whole length of the schoolroom with his finger on 
a word in order to have the teacher pronounce it for him. 
Teachers who are inclined to tolerate such practices in their 
-schoolrooms need to be quite frequently reminded that the 
mind of the pupil must act before he can succeed in the recogni- 
tion of the words before him. 
A person’s mind acts under the promptings of two kinds of 
attention; namely, forced attention and spontaneous attention. 
It is necessary at times for the teacher to appeal to the first 
kind of attention in order to get any work at all done by cer- 
tain members of a class. Usually, however, when attention is 
forced, there obtains to a corresponding degree a more or less 
unprofitable expenditure of energy on the part of both teacher 
and pupil. Then, too, the forced attention is operative only 
during the period when the teacher and pupil are in direct con-
-P-A-G-E-92
  82 THE TEACHING OF READING 
tact one with the other. There is a need for an operative at- 
tention which will impel the pupil to a continuous practice in 
word recognition—in reading—during the time the pupil is the 
master of his own devices. Spontaneous attention can be relied 
on always to operate with a maximum of results because such 
attention is not divided. 
A person turns his attention, or his attention is attracted, to 
a given object, process, or piece of work because of its appeal to 
some immediate or remote, some instinctive or acquired, inter- 
est. When attention is forced in the reading lesson, or else- 
where, it is necessarily quite unproductive for the reason that 
it is divided between the pupil’s instinctive fear of punishment, 
such as threats, scoldings, demerits, etc., and the work he is 
called upon to do. Spontaneous attention is not a divided 
attention. The reason is that it is called forth by an instinctive 
interest in adventure, excitement, hero tales, romance, animal 
stories, activities, etc. which forms the basis of the work at 
hand. Contrast the effectiveness for the reading work of second- 
grade and third-grade pupils of the two selections from school 
readers of an earlier day given in the following quotation: 
MR. LONGFELLOW 
This is a picture of Mr. Longfellow. 
He was the boy who lived near the sea. 
He is an old gentleman in this picture. . . . 
He was a poet. 
A poet has beautiful thoughts. 
He writes them for others to read. . . . 
When he was a boy he went to school. 
Then he went to Bowdoin College. . . . 
He then went across the ocean. . . . 
When he came back he was a teacher in Bowdoin College. 
. .. The picture of Longfellow [excites] some momentary interest, 
but what of the sentences that follow? Our study of apperception 
revealed no more ill-adapted material than discussions of Bowdoin 
College for seven-year-olds. Most children would certainly not be
-P-A-G-E-93
  
THE NATURE OF RECOGNITION 83 
attentive to such material unless they were forced to be. Contrast 
now the following “thriller” from a third reader published in the same 
year as the story of Mr. Longfellow: 
KING TAWNY MANE 
There was once a lion whose name was Tawny Mane. He was so strong 
that all the other animals were afraid of him, so he was called the king of the 
forest. He liked to kill every animal that came in his way, and there was no 
living thing in all the land that was safe from him. 
At last, one day, all the animals met to talk about their troubles, and see 
if they could not find some plan to save themselves from King Tawny Mane. 
They talked a long time, and then agreed what to do. 
In the evening they went together to the lion’s den. King Tawny Mane 
had just had a full meal, so he did not try to harm any of them. “What do 
you want here?” he roared. 
This frightened them very much. Some of them ran back into the thick 
woods. But the bravest stood still. “Speak and tell me what you want,” 
said the king. 
Then Sharp Ears, the fox, stood up and spoke. 
Can you imagine an ordinary child who would not be anxious to read 
on and find out what Sharp Ears said about the plan to send one animal 
each day to appease the king’s hunger? Perhaps even you would like 
to know the adventure of little Cotton Tail which comes in the story 
after the following paragraphs : 
At last the lot fell upon a little rabbit named Cotton Tail, and he was sent 
to make a call upon the king. He was in no hurry to go. He played along 
the road until after dinner time. Then, with big eyes and gentle steps, he 
went and stood at the lion’s door. 
King Tawny Mane was very hungry, and when he saw the rabbit he 
roared, ‘Why are you so late? Even the elephant knows better than to keep 
me waiting.” 
The rabbit bowed low and said, “I know I am late. But if you could only 
see what I have seen, you would not blame me.” 
“What have you seen?” said the lion. 
Interest in adventure prominent in social life ; its use is effective in 
teaching reading.—The interest which would carry a child or an adult 
through the above story is the same interest that made Homer’s stories 
of the wanderings of Ulysses so popular with the Greeks and that now 
gives a popular journal a circulation of millions of copies each week.
-P-A-G-E-94
  
84 THE TEACHING OF READING 
It is one of the strongest interests born in human beings ; namely, the 
interest in adventure, in excitement, in romance. When coupled with 
the courageous and fighting instincts it carries thousands of red- 
blooded persons to all ends of the earth in search of new and thrilling 
experiences. At the same time it impels many of the most timid and 
peace-loving to sit in their comfortable homes or at the movies, and 
thrill over the deeds of detectives and crooks, cowboys and hunters, 
soldiers and sailors, knights and their ladies. Obviously, we save much 
time and energy in teaching children to read if we can use this 
interest to keep them attentive during the reading period and to get 
them to read voluntarily out of school hours. Consequently many 
adventure stories are now read in the elementary school, from “The 
Three Billy Goats Gruff” in the first grade to “Treasure Island” in 
the upper grades.t 
There is yet another, though somewhat closely related, reason 
why the content of children’s reading material should appeal 
to their instinctive interests. We are aware of the marked 
tendency of people to read into a selection what is in their 
minds instead of what appears on the page of print (note again 
the fourth characteristic of recognition discussed above). 
Pupils in their reading lessons very frequently recognize a 
familiar word as some other word which is entirely different in 
meaning and quite different in form, largely because their 
attention is divided and their minds are occupied with thoughts 
unrelated to the work at hand. Practice in reading involving 
word recognition of the kind just referred to is by no means 
effective practice having lasting results. This paragraph is 
only another way of stating that the full, undivided attention 
of pupils needs to be given to the work at hand. 
Summary. Preceding chapters have pointed out that the de- 
mands of modern life make necessary the attainment of a high 
degree of skill in the reading process. The present chapter 
traces one phase of the development of skill in this process, and 
indicates the necessity of considerable practice in order that

the desired goal may be reached. Such practice must, of course, 
be effective. It is necessary, therefore, that the reading mate- 
rial be such as to cause little interruption to the reading proc- 
ess, but, because of its interesting content, to attract the keen 
attention of pupils. The main points of the chapter are as 
follows: : 
1. Recognition in reading does not. proceed letter by letter, 
but in word-wholes, phrase-wholes, and sometimes in sentence- 
wholes. 
2. As the reader approaches maturity he becomes capable of 
recognizing in larger and larger units. 
3. The development of the ability to recognize in larger and 
larger units corresponds to the amount of increase in one’s 
familiarity with words and phrases. 
4. Recognition is a mental act. 
5. Recognition is capable of being improved through train- 
ing. 
6. The mind does not require sensory stimulations to be 
complete. r 
7. The mind supplies what the eye fails to behold. 
8. Words, not letters, provide the logical starting point in 
teaching to read. 
9. Analysis of words into letter-elements and sound-elements 
must not be ready-made for the learner. 
to. Considerable practice is necessary in order to make 
recognition rapid and easy. 
11. Reading material must be easy and its content not diffi- 
cult to understand. 
12. The content of reading’ material must appeal to the in- 
stinctive interests of pupils.

CHAPTER VI 
THE BALANCE BETWEEN MECHANICS AND MEANING 
In the two chapters just preceding, the discussions of reading 
have dealt largely with what may be called the mechanical 
phases of the process. Such topics as fixation pauses, what the 
eye sees in reading, units of fixation, recognition span, and 
characteristics of recognition have been placed in the forefront 
of the discussions. The reading process has been considered as 
a mechanical process, and only by implication as a process of 
extracting thought from the printed page. The purpose of the 
present chapter is to continue the discussion of the mechanical 
phase of reading in order that it may be possible in the chapter 
which follows to consider the reading process explicitly as a 
process of getting meaning and to point out the intimate rela- 
tionship which exists between mechanics and interpretation. 
Mechanics and meaning as conflicting conceptions. In the 
actual practice of the schools a sharp conflict of opinion has 
been allowed to develop as to the relative importance of em- 
phasis on the mechanics of reading and emphasis on meaning. 
The two conceptions have been set over one against the other 
as conflicting principles in the teaching of reading. The one 
would strive to make reading wholly a mechanical, or formal, 
process ; the other would neglect mechanics and form and place 
entire emphasis upon content and interpretation. 
No real conflict exists. Despite the sharpness of the contrast 
exhibited, one has no difficulty in seeing that neither conception 
of the reading process is complete in itself, and that training in 
reading involves training in both mechanics and interpretation. 
Arguments which seem to support either conception may very 
87 
 
-P-A-G-E-98
  
88 THE TEACHING OF READING 
readily be arrayed in opposition to arguments which seem to 
support the other. However, the very incompleteness of the 
list of arguments which may be grouped exclusively under the 
one or the other conception always points to the fact that, 
though the conflict between the two conceptions may appar- 
ently be very strong, it really is of little importance. The point 
of view of the present discussion toward mechanics and mean- 
ing is implied very strongly in the concluding sentences of the 
following paragraph by McMurry: 
The history of schools and of courses of study during the last three 
hundred years demonstrates a constant and powerful tendency toward 
one-sided formalism, especially toward linguistic forms, grammar, etc. 
The reformers have fought against this narrow routine, and in recent 
years with increasing success. There has been, thus, an age-long quarrel 
between those who favor studies of a formal type and those demanding 
a rich thought content in school subjects. Whole systems of education 
have been strongly tagged with one or the other of these features. In 
all sound education one would naturally think that these two essential 
elements, form and thought, should be closely combined, and we may 
well be disappointed at this universal tendency in schools to run to 
extremes and to separate them as if they were hostile to each other. 
In all studies a close combination of these two elements should be 
earnestly sought. In superior literature and in fine art the two elements 
are well balanced and combined. The perfection which is the supreme 
quality in literature and art is the masterly union of form and thought. 
In human behavior at its best we likewise find this intimate blending of 
idea and form, whose proper combination gives us good manners. The 
ideal result to be aimed at in all conduct is, as far as practicable, a 
proper blending of form and thought. 
Main points of the discussion. With the point of view toward 
mechanics and meaning which has just been advanced as a 
determining factor, the remaining discussion of this and of the 
following chapter will bear upon three important topics, as

follows: (1) the importance of emphasis upon mechanics; 
(2) the interpretation of what is read; and (3) the relation of 
mechanics to the process of reading for meaning. 
I, THE IMPORTANCE OF EMPHASIS UPON MECHANICS 
Poor reading in the lower grades. A study of the eye- 
movement record of a poor reader in the lower grades will pro- 
vide a starting point for our discussion of the importance of 
emphasis upon mechanics. Let us reéxamine Fig. 8, Chap- 
ter IV, which contains the record of the eye movements of a 
poor reader in the fourth grade. 
Characteristic of this record are the unusually large number 
of fixation pauses to the line and the extreme length of some 
of the pauses. A third striking feature of this record impresses 
the observer. It is that the movement of the eyes of the poor 
reader instead of being progressive—that is, steadily forward 
from left to right across the line—is regressive in character, 
and that the usual forward movement of the eyes is very fre- 
quently interrupted by backward movements. 
Regressive movements indicate periods of confusion. What 
is the significance of the regressive eye movements which are 
presented in the record? The backward movement of the eyes 
at the beginning of a line (see Figs. 4 and 5) is very easily 
explained. In the fixation at the beginning of a new line in 
reading the process is complicated by the result of the long, 
sweeping movement of the eyes from right to left from the 
preceding line. The eye stops to fixate at a point in a word near 
the beginning which does not produce the necessary amount 
of visual stimulation to result in recognition. The eye accord- 
ingly moves back to a point nearer the beginning of the line 
for a second fixation before eye movement and recognition can 
proceed as usual. Again, in beginning the process of reading 
the first line of a passage often results in a certain amount of 
regressive movement. Here the backward movement is to be
-P-A-G-E-100

explained by the unusual expenditure of energy (which is the 
case in all activities) in the process of getting started. 
It is evident that the explanations which have just been 
offered do not apply to the situation which is presented in the 
regressive movements of Fig. 8. Unlike the ordinary back- 
ward movement, explained above, the regressive movements 
of Fig. 8 are representative of a complete breakdown in the 
reading process of the pupil. These movements are not at 
all characteristic of the ordinary reading process or of progress 
toward maturity. They are wholly different in character from 
the movements made by good readers. One would imagine that 
a majority of them are made in the effort of the reader to secure 
a larger and a necessary amount of visual stimulation, if it 
were not for the fact that in more than half of the fixations the 
visual stimulation is no different from that of preceding ones. 
The reader will observe that in Fig. 8 there is a constant 
backward and forward movement of the eyes over the same 
ground that was gone over in previous movements. The ex- 
planation does not hold, because it is quite clear that the con- 
tinued repetition of the same visual stimulations is wholly 
unnecessary for the ordinary process of word recognition. 
Again, as it is pointed out by Judd,' the explanation if left to 
an ardent devotee of the A B C method might take the follow- 
ing form: “This child is exploring the letters in the words and 
will in due time develop the power of recognizing the word as 
a whole.” The answer to this explanation is that if the pupil 
were spelling the words letter by letter, there would be no need 
for any but the steadily forward, progressive movement of the 
eyes from one letter to the next. 
The only explanation that remains of the wandering, regres- 
sive movements of Fig. 8 is that they are not representative 
of the kind of recognition which results in fluent reading;

that the reading process has broken down because recognition 
is not following its usual course; that the movements are typi- 
cal of a period of “confusion,” such as always follows the in- 
terruption of the normal procedure in any activity. The term 
“confusion” will be used to describe such wandering, regressive 
movements as are to be found in Fig. 8. 
The problem of the school with reference to periods of con- 
fusion. The problem of the school with reference to periods of 
confusion may be considered from two points of view; namely, 
providing remedies for confusion periods after they have arisen 
and organizing the work of the school so as to prevent periods 
of confusion. Although considerable attention will always have 
to be given to problems of the former type, it is to problems of 
the latter type that teachers ought to devote the larger amounts 
of time and effort. It is always better to make use of educa- 
tional methods which prevent periods of confusion than to 
attempt to cure such difficulties after they have arisen. 
Training in word analysis is important in the earlier grades. 
As a means of both prevention and cure of periods of confusion, 
such as are represented in the wandering, regressive movements 
to be seen in Fig. 8, training in the analysis of words is very 
important. The reasons for this type of training can be enu- 
merated in part by repeating the discussions of the preced- 
ing chapter. The reader is aware that the complex process of 
recognition in word-wholes and phrase-wholes which the adult 
reader is able to perform under the stimulation of very slight 
visual cues represents a type of maturity that can be reached 
only by considerable training and practice. The more un- 
familiar a word is, the more the recognition of it proceeds 
syllable by syllable and letter by letter. Conversely, with the 
increase in familiarity of reading material proceeds the devel- 
opment of recognition into larger and larger units. It would 
seem to be the particular business of the school to make use of 
and give direction to the natural tendency of the eye to break 
up into its parts, to analyze, and to examine in detail, anything
-P-A-G-E-102
92 THE TEACHING OF READING 
that is not already familiar. If the school allows this tendency 
of the eye to function without direction and guidance, the 
school can expect very inadequate development of the process 
of recognition, which is in part the cause of and in part the 
result of such periods of confusion as are recorded in Fig. 8. 
On the other hand, if the school overemphasizes the use of de- 
tailed analysis, there will result the tendency toward little or 
no development of the process of recognition into larger and 
larger units. 
Method in teaching to read as an illustration. Reference to 
the method employed by successful primary teachers of reading 
will serve to illustrate the general statements of the preceding 
paragraphs. Use is made from the very beginning of the fa- 
miliar words of the child’s vocabulary. The meaningful sound 
unit, the word, which is everywhere the unit of pronunciation, 
is employed as a starting point in the development of the 
process of reading. The child is led to attach the same meaning 
reaction to the printed sign of the word as he is accustomed 
to attach to the spoken word. In the beginning no attention is 
paid to the complex of letters or phonic elements which go to 
make up the word. 
The method is very successful. In a few weeks the child is 
able to read the stories in the early part of his primer from be- 
ginning to end. He has acquired the command of the printed 
signs of a small stock of easy, familiar words. As a result of 
taking part in word drills and of practice in oral reading he 
can recognize instantaneously any one of his stock of words. 
No serious difficulties are encountered during the first few 
weeks of the training period. 
Unless there has been also a development of the phonic ap- 
proach to new words, however, the word method soon begins to 
be in difficulty. Words of some length which are not a part of 
the child’s ordinary speech are presently encountered in the' 
reading lessons. At this point the strictly word method breaks 
down. Meeting the longer and more or less unfamiliar word, 
 
-P-A-G-E-103
  MECHANICS AND MEANING 93 
the child becomes aware of a mass of visual stimulation which 
he cannot make use of nor in any wise relate. He responds to 
this apparently complex mass of letters in one of three ways: 
(1) With a complete lack of independence on his part he turns 
to the teacher for help in surmounting the difficulty encountered 
im the new word. It is the all too common practice to permit 
pupils to interrupt themselves in the reading of a sentence in 
order to receive help from the teacher in recognizing a word. 
(2) The pupil turns away from new and difficult words without 
making any effort to determine what they might be. (3) He at- 
tempts an analysis of the unfamiliar and difficult words, which, 
in the majority of cases, leaves him floundering in a period of 
confusion. 
The number of pupils who fail to make progress in the recog- 
nition of new and difficult and more or less unfamiliar words, 
because they either turn away from them or flounder in periods 
of confusion, is by no means small. One becomes impressed 
with the seriousness of the situation only as he becomes ac- 
quainted with the large number of pupils in every grade of 
elementary and high school who are failing in all their work be- 
cause of the sheer inability to cope with the difficulties involved 
in the mere mechanics of reading. 
In order to train the pupil to overcome the difficulties which 
he encounters when he first begins to meet new and difficult 
words,— words which are of some length or not a part of the 
child’s ordinary speech,— the school makes use of an organized 
system of instruction in the analysis of words into their phonic 
elements. Training in phonics and word analysis begins in the 
first year. It extends throughout the whole of the primary-school 
period. Such training is a legitimate phase of instruction in 
reading. It represents a taking advantage of the opportunity 
for instruction offered by the natural bent of the pupils to view 
in detail the new and difficult words which appear in their read- 
ing lessons. The following quotations are especially pertinent 
to this and the foregoing discussions :
-P-A-G-E-104
  
“94 THE TEACHING OF READING 
If a child is going to be distracted by his efforts to recognize words we 
may as well anticipate the difficulty and distract him to some purpose 
while we teach him how to master distractions.t 
Analysis of words cannot be omitted from any complete training of 
pupils. The experience of schools in this matter is unequivocal. A 
child can read without analysis so long as his vocabylary is small and 
the words are short, but sooner or later he must make analyses, and 
then he will be greatly helped if he has been trained in systematic 
methods. As to the time when this analysis should be introduced, it 
seems to be suggested by the dominance of oral language at the be- 
ginning of school life that the word unit be accepted at first and 
analysis be introduced later when it is needed to keep the word 
units clear.” 
The discussions of the preceding paragraphs justify us in 
adopting the practice of substituting habits of careful analysis 
in the place of wasteful periods of confusion. The sharp dis- 
tinction between the two types of activity now demands our 
attention as well as the limited purpose of analytical methods 
in teaching to read. Thus far our discussion has offered but 
one purpose for the use of analysis; namely, to prevent and to 
cure periods of confusion. It remains to be seen that beyond 
such a purpose analysis has no justification.* 
Analysis is productive; confusion unproductive. The dis- 
tinction between a period of analysis and a period of confusion 
is made quite clear by the records of eye movement shown in 
Fig. 8. It is evident that the result in recognition of fixa- 
tions 8 to 14 is quite different from that of fixations 1 to 7. 
With but one exception the fixations are of the straightforward, 
progressive type, and are representative of a period of minute 
analysis.

8 We are discussing reading. It is true that training in phonics functions 
also in spelling.
-P-A-G-E-105
  MECHANICS AND MEANING 95 
The distinction can be pointed out in another way. A period 
of confusion is represented by wandering movements of the 
eyes, apparently without a definite purpose and evidently with- 
out result. A period of analysis, on the other hand, represents 
a definite, purposeful attack on a word or group of words, and 
it is productive of very definite results from the standpoint of 
recognition. The two types of activity are similar in the im- 
portant respect that each involves a detailed inspection of the 
reading material. We shall see in the discussion of the follow- 
ing topic that both types of activity are away from the in- 
stantaneous synthetic recognition of words and phrases. 
Fluent synthetic recognition is the goal of instruction. The 
eye-movement records of the adult, Fig. 2, and of the sixth- 
grade and seventh-grade readers, Figs. 6 and 7, are representa- 
tive of the goal which instruction in reading should endeavor 
to train pupils to reach. Figs. 4-7 represent progressive stages 
of development in the direction of that goal. Whether defined 
in terms of a description of these records or in terms of the 
discussions of the preceding chapter, the definition of the goal 
of instruction in reading is the same. It is that pupils should 
be trained to recognize the material they read in larger and 
larger units; that training should be away from an analytical 
inspection of words toward a fluent synthetic grasp of mean- 
ingful phrases. 
The foregoing discussions make clear that a neglect of 
mechanical training does not result in any development toward 
the goal which was just defined. It is evident that the resulting 
periods of confusion are distinctly opposed to development of 
any kind whatsoever. The purpose of mechanical training is to 
avoid periods of confusion. On the other hand, it is almost, if 
not quite, as bad to overemphasize training in mechanics as to 
neglect it altogether. There is not a doubt but that the slow and 
laborious readers of the upper grades and high school owe the 
very inadequate results of their training in reading quite as 
much to an undue amount of instruction in phonics and word 
 
-P-A-G-E-106
  96 THE TEACHING OF READING 
analysis as to the lack of such instruction. The whole discus- 
sion can be summed up in the following summary of the results 
of training in phonics and word analysis: (1) the training does 
result in recognition; (2) it results in recognition of an inferior 
sort; (3) if overemphasized, it results in the development of 
habits of inspecting analytically all words and phrases met in 
reading. These habits become stronger and harder to break as 
the pupil progresses through school. They explain the tendency 
of slow and laborious readers to carry on all their reading in the 
smallest possible visual units. The tendency is noticeable in 
a very marked degree in the eye-movement record of a poor 
reader in the seventh grade. 
Overemphasis on mechanics leads to poor reading. Let us 
reéxamine Fig. 9. Judd’s description of this record is espe- 
cially important in its bearing on our present discussion: 
The characteristic fact here is that the reader is painfully slow and 
that the scope of each perception is very narrow. There are occasional 
regressive movements. In a way the danger in this situation is even 
greater than in the situations discovered in the lower grades. Here the 
pupil gets through the task of reading by slow and painful methods. 
His habits are evidently becoming fixed while his methods are wrong. | 
Where the pupil got such bad methods is difficult to say. Possibly 
he acquired them through his own unguided efforts. It is not at all 
impossible that he got the first suggestion of short units of recognition 
from phonic work or spelling taught in the school. Whatever the 
source, these short units of recognition represent a pernicious limita- 
tion of the child’s efforts. His habits are the more pernicious because 
they are reinforced by the natural tendencies toward visual analysis and 
run counter to the demand for broad units of recognition comprehend- 
ing meaningful phrases. 
In an earlier paragraph we had occasion to point out that phonic 
analysis is a possible means of helping a pupil out of confusions. We 
encounter in the short units of recognition one of the possible dangers 
of phonic or other analytical methods.t

MECHANICS AND MEANING 97 
Conclusion: Phonic analysis is a mechanical device for, not a 
method of, teaching to read. The foregoing discussions may 
be summed up in the statement that phonic analysis is an im- 
portant factor in the teaching of reading but that it is not in 
itself a method of teaching. It has been made clear that its use is 
necessary in leading pupils to recognize new and difficult words, 
but that if overemphasized or poorly taught it may become a 
hindrance to the attainment of a fluent synthetic grasp of words 
and phrases. 
The matter can be stated in another way. The beginning 
pupil needs no phonetic introduction to the recognition of the 
familiar words of his daily speech which are taught as sight 
words. He therefore is directed to proceed immediately to the 
recognition of these words as wholes. To the recognition of 
the less familiar words and the longer words encountered in the 
intermediate grades, the pupil does need a phonetic introduction. 
When the introduction has been made the pupil has no more use 
for phonic analysis of the words in question. He proceeds now 
as before to the recognition of these words as wholes. Only as 
he meets new and difficult words does the pupil need to make 
use of his abilities in phonics. Phonic analysis leads to an ac- 
quaintanceship with these words. Just as soon as the acquaint- 
ance is made the pupil forsakes his phonics and proceeds by 
proper methods to the recognition of these words in larger and 
larger units. 
The foregoing discussion has dealt with the importance of 
emphasis on mechanics from the standpoint of the advantage 
of avoiding periods of confusion in the early grades of the 
school. It is desirable at this point in our discussion to view the 
subject from a somewhat different angle; namely, that which 
relates to the similarity of progress in the mechanics and the 
formation of habit. 
The ability to read is a type of skill. The development of the 
ability to carry on the reading process as a means of extracting 
thought from the printed page can be described as a phase of
-P-A-G-E-108
  98 THE TEACHING OF READING 
the general psychology of skill. The name “process” itself 
implies that reading is something to be done,—a physical or a 
mental act, or an act which is both physical and mental,—in the 
doing of which one becomes more proficient with each repeti- 
tion of the act. Reference to Fig. 2 is sufficient to impress 
the fact that in the reading of a passage the eyes of a trained 
reader tend to fall into a series of movements which may be 
described as characteristic and which show all the evidence of 
being habitual. A comparison of Figs. 4-7 emphasizes the fact 
that progress in reading is typified by movements of the eyes 
which mark the attainment of higher and higher degrees of 
skill, The same comparison shows, quite as well as our own 
schoolroom observation, that children become more and more 
skillful in word recognition—that the instantaneous recognition 
of words becomes more and more an habitual performance—as 
they advance through the grades of the school. The designa- 
tion of the reading process as a “mechanical” process in itself 
is an admission that it is capable eventually of being carried on 
mechanically; that is, automatically, without thought as to 
what is being done and with the expenditure of but very little 
effort. 
The relation of reading as a mechanical process to our gen- 
eral notions of habit and skill is implied in our definitions of 
the aims and important outcomes of reading instruction. We 
state that the aim of reading instruction is the development of 
good reading habits,—to develop skillful readers we adopt as 
the purpose of our teaching. The aim set up in Chapter I—to 
develop effective rapid silent readers—implies that our effort 
shall be to develop sili in securing meaning from the printed 
page and to encourage the development of the Habit of reading 
rapidly. 
We use the terms “habit” and “skill” indiscriminately in 
speaking of the aims and outcomes of reading instruction. Usu- 
ally we give but little thought to their significance as bearing 
on the methods we ought to adopt in our teaching. The neces-
-P-A-G-E-109
  MECHANICS AND MEANING 99 
sity of giving careful consideration to the import of these terms 
impresses us as we go further and further into the description 
of the reading process. A careful review of the reading process 
up to this point justifies the conclusion that the psychology of 
reading is only a chapter in the psychology of skill; that the 
stages in the development of skill in general and the laws of 
habit formation constitute a very fruitful field as a basis for the 
study of the development of skill in the mechanics of reading. 
A summary of the characteristic stages in the development of 
skill and of the important laws of habit formation follow. 
Characteristics of skill in general. 1. Beginning the process 
of acquiring skill in any particular activity is accompanied by 
the employment of a large number of useless movements and 
the expenditure of a great amount of effort. This is the primary 
stage in the development of skill. 
2. After skill has been acquired the activity in question can 
be performed with a minimum of muscular and mental action 
and with the expenditure of but a modicum of effort. This, the 
final, stage in the development of skill is characterized by the 
fact that one is able to perform the activity mechanically, auto- 
matically, practically without thought. The method of devel- 
opment from the primary to the final stage is defined by the 
laws of habit formation. 
Laws of habit formation. 1. In the beginning the attention 
of the learner shall be centered upon the habit to be acquired. 
In terms of schoolroom practice this means that the pupil shall 
understand exactly what responses are expected of him. In 
oral reading, for example, the teacher may very well begin the 
reading herself and in this manner set before the pupils a model 
of correct pronunciation, proper articulation, and good expres- 
sion. The law requires the teaching of new words to be thor- 
ough and the application of phonic analysis to difficult words to 
be understood. 
2. The second law is that attentive repetitions are necessary 
in order to make permanent the results which were outlined in
-P-A-G-E-110
  100 THE TEACHING OF READING 
the first law. This means that it is not enough for pupils to 
learn what good reading is like, for example, or to learn to 
recognize the words which occur in their lessons, or to learn 
to work out for themselves the pronunciation and recognition 
of new words. Considerable drill must follow, and the drill 
must be attentive. 
3. The third law is that no exception shall be permitted until 
the habit is firmly established. This means that there must be 
continued attentive practice in oral reading, in silent reading, 
in word analysis, in word recognition, until these operations 
have become habits; that is, have become automatic. 
It will not be necessary for us at this point to enter into a 
more complete discussion of the laws of habit formation as they 
apply to the teaching of reading. In our study of the charac- 
teristics of recognition in the preceding chapter we have become 
impressed with the necessity for a large amount of drill in order 
to make automatic the mechanical phase of reading. In a fol- 
lowing part of this book we shall have occasion to return to 
the present discussion in outlining certain specific devices and 
methods of instruction and drill. It is important for us at this 
time to return to a consideration of the characteristic stages 
in the development of skill in order to obtain further evidence 
bearing upon our point, that emphasis upon the mechanics of 
reading is an important phase of instruction. 
Reading is a difficult process for beginners. Anyone who has 
ever observed the difficulties encountered by primary teachers 
of reading cannot but be impressed by the fact that reading is 
a very complex mechanical process and, as such, presents to 
beginners many important features of difficulty. The fact that 
strikes the observer of primary instruction with greatest force 
is that a large number of children in the lower grades are more 
or less bewildered by the demands made upon them in the read- 
ing lessons. The high degree of uncertainty with which a num- 
ber of children approach the tasks set before them attracts one’s 
attention at the outset. One is impressed by the apparently
-P-A-G-E-111
  MECHANICS AND MEANING IOI 
wasted effort of the pupils rather than by the slow progress they 
may be making from day to day. The sharpness of the contrast 
between the ease with which adults read and the difficulties of 
beginning pupils is the highly impressive feature of one’s 
observation. 
Reference to Fig. 8 helps to confirm the statement that the 
first stage in the development of a skill is characterized by 
a large number of useless movements. Fig. 8 establishes the 
fact that the pupil in question is expending an enormous 
amount of energy without any apparent result. How utterly 
bewildered the pupil is appears in the excessive number of fixa- 
tions made and the unusual amount of time consumed. The 
pupil appears to be striving in every conceivable way to accom- 
plish the result desired without knowing really what the result 
would be should he be fortunate enough to secure it. 
Further evidence bearing upon the fact that reading is a 
very difficult process for beginners is obtainable in every grade 
of elementary and high school. One is able to find a large 
number of pupils who are compelled to apply themselves to 
any one of their studies two, three, and four times as long as 
some of their more progressive classmates in order to accom- 
plish the same amount of work. It is not unusual to find in any 
grade of the school large numbers of children who are failing in 
all their work because of the sheer inability to cope with the 
difficulties they experience in the mechanics-of reading. What 
is the significance of the fact that one can ascribe to poor read- 
ing, quite as much as to any other factor, the cause of failures 
in school? The significance is that reading is such a difficult 
process as to require practically all the time and energy one 
can devote to it until its mechanical features have been mas- 
tered. One is able to understand how difficult the reading proc- 
ess must be for beginners when he observes what difficulties 
more mature pupils experience who have been so unfortunate 
as to fail to master the mechanics of reading in the early grades 
of the school.
-P-A-G-E-112
  102 THE TEACHING OF READING 
Energy is saved by making the process automatic. The char- 
acteristic features of the final stage in the development of a 
skill are made evident by contrast with those of the first stage. 
The contrast between the methods of study of poor readers and 
of good readers; the contrast between the slow and uncertain 
reading of the beginner and the ease and fluency of the more 
mature reader ; the tremendous task of the one in contrast with 
the almost effortless task of the other,—these contrasts we have 
referred to time and again in this chapter. They are easily 
observable in every schoolroom and need no additional dis- 
cussion here. It is well, however, for us to consider briefly the 
definition of the term very frequently used to describe the final 
stage of development; namely, an automatic process. 
An automatic process is one we are able to perform with a 
minimum of thought and effort. All that is necessary in order 
to perform the process is to begin the performance; the per- 
formance then proceeds, as it were, of its own accord. One 
does not have to stop the performance at any point and decide 
what to do next; indeed, the major part of one’s attention can 
be devoted the while to a different kind of activity. In word 
recognition our attention is directed to or attracted by a very 
slight and apparently insignificant sensory cue, and immedi- 
ately the process of recognition is complete. In handwriting 
we are able to make all sorts of complex and highly coérdi- 
nated movements of fingers, hand, and arm in shaping the 
various letters and at the same time devote practically all our 
thought to the ideas we desire to express. Because the various 
codrdinated movements are made with a minimum of attention 
to the process, they consume a minimum of energy. The fact is 
apparent to most of us when we attempt to imitate the writing 
movements of a left-handed person. In performing a process 
that is not automatic—for example, using the unaccustomed 
hand in writing—one has to expend his energy not only in the 
performance itself but also in determining from time to time 
how each part of the process is performed and what to do next.
-P-A-G-E-113
  
MECHANICS AND MEANING 103 
As a process becomes automatic it requires in its performance 
the consumption of smaller and smaller amounts of energy. 
Energy is thus set free for use elsewhere. 
Conclusion: Emphasis on mechanics is an important phase 
of instruction. The conclusion of the whole matter is easily 
determined. In the first part of the present chapter we saw 
how the child’s own unguided efforts lead him into periods of 
confusion and thus throw into his way very formidable obsta- 
cles to his future progress. The necessity for careful, system- 
atic instruction in a well-known mechanical device—phonic 
analysis—was emphasized. In the latter half of the chapter we 
have discussed the relation of reading as a mechanical process 
to the general laws of habit formation and to the characteristic 
phases in the development of skill. The discussion calls atten- 
tion to the sharp contrast between the difficulty of carrying 
on the mechanical phase of reading before it has been mastered 
and the ease of performing the same process after it has been 
mastered, The economy of an early mastery of mechanics is 
very clear. Reduced to its simplest terms, our conclusion would 
be: The mechanical phase of the reading process should be 
made as easy as possible by making it as automatic as possible.

  CHAPTER VII 
THE BALANCE BETWEEN MECHANICS AND MEANING 
(ConTINUED) 
The preceding chapter opened the discussion of the balance 
between mechanics and meaning by pointing out the impor- 
tance of emphasis on mechanics. The way was thus paved for 
the discussion of the present chapter, which considers the read- 
ing process explicitly as a process of getting meaning from the 
printed page and endeavors to point out the intimate relation- 
ship between mechanics and interpretation. 
II. INTERPRETATION 
The former view emphasized the importance of mental pic- 
tures. The psychology of an earlier day based its explanation 
of the method of getting meaning from the printed page on the 
assumption that words get their meanings by their relationship 
with the pictures which the sight of them calls up in the mind 
of the reader. To every word of one’s acquaintance there is 
stored away in the mind a corresponding and related mental 
picture or image. The calling to mind of the proper image is 
the true explanation of how words convey meaning. One recog- 
nizes a word in reading, the argument runs, and the sight of the 
word calls to mind a train of pictures. The pictures are the 
important mental facts; they alone determine meaning. 
The interpretation of literature as an illustration. The ease 
with which one can call up all sorts of mental imagery is usu- 
ally considered one of the most potent factors in determining 
104
-P-A-G-E-115
MECHANICS AND MEANING 105 
one’s ability to interpret a passage of literature. Professor 
Betts! makes use of several quotations from Halleck? in order 
to show the value of a large stock of imagery to the student of 
literature : 
Milton has Eve say of her dream of the fatal apple: 
... The pleasant sav’ry smell 
So quickened appetite, that I, methought, 
Could not but taste. 
How utterly impossible for one who has not a delicate sense of 
smell and a large stock of images from this sense to interpret these 
lines! They will be to him but a jumble of words, and he is likely to 
decide that poetry is nothing but foolishness. 
Likewise with the sense of touch: 
. .. I take thy hand, this hand 
As soft as dove’s down, and as white as it. 
Or from Comus : 
Thus I set my printless feet 
O’er the cowslip’s velvet head 
That bends not as I tread. 
Imagine a person devoid of delicate tactile imagery, with senseless 
finger tips and leaden footsteps, undertaking to interpret these exquis- 
ite lines! : . . 
Who that has not stood under the open sky and watched the stars 
come out, and retained a vivid impression of the experience, can under- 
stand when Longfellow says : 
Silently, one by one, in the infinite meadows of heaven, 
Blossomed the lovely stars; the forget-me-nots of the angels! 
All literature is so full of visual imagery that one can hardly find a 
couplet that is not filled with it. 
The conclusion one is apt to draw from the preceding quota- 
tions is that the action of the mind in reading is comparable to

106 THE TEACHING OF READING 
a stereopticon exhibition in which one picture, or mental image, 
displaces another in rapid succession. 
The former view prevails in educational theory and practice. 
The foregoing explanation of how meaning is secured in read- 
ing is the one quite commonly accepted. It is perhaps the 
first to occur to anyone who ever takes the trouble to look for 
an explanation. It is very plausible and easy to accept ; indeed, 
it is the obvious explanation. It abounds in educational theory, 
and educational practice takes its form to a large extent in 
accordance with its terms. The following paragraphs are 
quoted to illustrate the prevalence of the view. Judd quotes the 
first two to illustrate the so-called psychological method in 
teaching a foreign language of associating a word with the 
object or image to which it refers. The first is a statement of 
the Committee of Twelve of the Modern Language Association 
of America, 1898; the second is an example from the notes of 
Charles Schweitzer taken at the conference at Sorbonne. 
On presenting each new word to the beginner, the instructor exhorts 
him to close his eyes and form a distinct mental picture of the thing or 
act represented. This image (it is affirmed) will remain indissolubly 
connected with the word, and the evocation of the one will always re- 
call the other. Sometimes real objects or drawings are used, and pan- 
tomime is frequently resorted to; but in most cases reliance is placed 
on the child’s active imagination.t 
Take, for example, the word “apple.” In learning his native tongue 
the French child sees the fruit placed before him on the table or sus- 
pended from the tree. At the same time someone pronounces to him 
the word “apple” and accompanies the pronunciation with a gesture. 
After the experience has been repeated several times an indissoluble 
association is formed between the two percepts, one a visual percept 
and the other an auditory percept. An equation is set up in the mind of 
the child between the word “apple” and the image of an apple. The 
two members of the equation form so intimate an association that the

image of the object will invariably call up the word and that which 
the word was intended to introduce, namely, the image of the object.t 
The writer recently heard a teachers’ institute instructor dis- 
cuss what he called the psychological method of teaching word 
recognition to primary-grade children. The discussion is con- 
densed into the following paragraph: 
A wealth of sensory experience should accompany every word that 
is taught to primary-grade children. The greater the amount of sensory 
experience provided the more thorough the teaching. In learning to 
recognize the word “apple,” for example, the child should see the 
apple and be led to connect the sight of it with the word. He should 
handle the apple, and connect the sense of touch with the word. Rolling 
the apple on the table or letting it drop to the floor, and connecting the 
characteristic sound produced with the word “apple” also helps. The 
child should smell the apple and connect the odor with the word. 
Finally, the apple should be eaten and the proper connection made 
between the word and the taste of the object it represents. 
The instructor qualified his suggestions by stating that the 
word “apple” should be taught in the season of the year when 
plenty of apples can be provided. 
The Manual and Course of Study for the Elementary Schools 
of Kentucky,? June, 1913, makes the following suggestions to 
teachers of reading: 
While the children are cutting from objects such as birds, animals, 
vegetables, fruits, etc., the printed and written names of these objects 
should be taught to the children and written by them... . 
“Reading must begin and at every point proceed on the basis of 
genuine vigorous thinking on the part of the child; and the life of such 
thinking is constant, clear, vivid imaging.” Another author says: 
“Reading is imaging.” Such imaging grows out of the real, significant 
enjoyable experiences of the child. The teacher should ever test such 
imaging by questioning, by requiring drawings or constructions, by

    108 THE TEACHING OF READING 
dramatization and other forms of expression. From the beginning to the 
end of the reading course the teacher’s care should be that the child 
has the thought. 
From the first the teacher’s aim should be to have the children weld 
firmly together the thought and the word or sentence by which the 
thought is expressed. It is of the greatest importance that the children 
image clearly as they read, 
Criticism of the “mental picture” explanation. It cannot be 
denied that the mind reconstructs mental pictures, though 
quite vague and very indefinite as to details, to correspond with 
the meanings which we derive from our reading. Likewise, the 
appearance of certain words on the page tends to call up in the 
mind of the reader images which are more or less vivid. Espe- 
cially is this true when the reader halts in his process of read- 
ing and makes the conscious effort to connect the given words 
with what appear to be the appropriate images. These facts are 
not the points at issue, however. The point is that the images 
which make their appearance in the mind during the reading of 
a passage, or the reading of certain words, are not the important 
mental facts in the apprehension of meaning. Let us examine 
the reasons. 
In the first place, one’s mental pictures are very indistinct 
and almost completely lacking in detail. It is the exception and 
not the rule that we examine in detail the things about us. Let 
the ordinary reader close his eyes and attempt to call to mind 
the details of the most familiar object in the room. His failure 
to succeed may be explained by the fact that he has heretofore 
received a satisfactory amount of meaning from the object in 
question without having to resort to any detailed examination. 
The inadequacy of mental pictures as an explanation of how 
meaning is obtained is further illustrated in the drawings of 
children. Children’s drawings may be described by the term 
“symbolical.” They do not illustrate; they are the symbols of 
the objects the child intends to represent. For example, four or 
five straight lines in a given arrangement are all that are neces-
-P-A-G-E-119
MECHANICS AND MEANING 109 
sary for a child to picture a man. The lines in a slightly differ- 
ent arrangement will picture a dog or a horse equally as well. 
Such drawings are very satisfactory to the child. He receives the 
same kind, if not the same degree, of pleasurable reaction from 
them as from the objects they were intended to represent. The 
tendency is to be noticed in the child’s inaccuracy in applying 
names to the objects about him. A broomstick answers all the 
purposes of a horse; it can be changed instantly, as if by 
magic, into a rifle. 
A second indication that images are not the important 
mental facts in the apprehension of meaning is the existence 
of a large number of words to which no appropriate mental 
pictures can be attached. Words like “appalling,” “exalted,” 
“however,” “accordingly,” “autocratic,” “bolshevism,” each 
contain for us a wealth of meaning which in no sense of the 
word can be explained by any mental pictures they may tend 
to call up. Indeed, any attempt to attach appropriate images 
to these words can be looked upon as a very artificial endeavor. 
“When the word ‘appalling’ strikes the ear, one feels his mus- 
cular system respond with a cringing, expectant shock. When 
one hears the word ‘ magnificent’ he feels a muscular expansion 
long before he is able by any exercise of imagination to place 
before his mind a picture of a magnificent object.”* The word 
“Hark!” arouses in us an attitude of expectancy. “Look 
out!” impels us to jump. When one sees the word “cat” there 
is experienced the same feeling of recoil or of friendliness as 
that felt in the presence of the animal itself. The words “large” 
and “small,” “up” and “down,” “rough” and “smooth,” arouse 
in one contrasting experiences. 
Meanings arise out of reactions: “the stream of conscious- 
ness.” Weare thus led to see that the psychology of the present 
day has a much more fruitful explanation of how meaning is 
apprehended from the printed page than the one which em- 
phasizes the importance of mental pictures. The explanation is 
1C. H. Judd, Psychology of High-School Subjects, p. 156.
-P-A-G-E-120
  
110 THE TEACHING OF READING 
that images are but isolated instances which appear as one 
reads; that meaning is derived from our reactions, feelings, and 
attitudes which are successively aroused in us at the appear- 
ance of successive words on a page; that meaning is indeed our 
reactions, feelings, and attitudes themselves. “The mind is not 
a mere storehouse of mental images,” says Judd; “It is an active 
organized personality responding with reactions to the excita- 
tions from the outer world.” 
For a fuller explanation we may liken consciousness to an 
ever-moving boat. The words we encounter during the process 
of reading become both the propelling and guiding influences 
which act on the movement of the boat. The boat is moved 
hither and yon according to its reactions to the motive forces 
of the words which act upon it. The scenery along the way is 
made up of our mental pictures. The scenery is not the impor- 
tant fact with reference to the motion of the boat; it is rather 
the result of the boat’s having been moved in a given direction 
and along a given course.” 
The context is influential in determining meaning. To pro- 
ceed with the figure, an isolated stroke of the oar does not de- 
termine the course of the boat; only as each stroke acts with 
every other stroke does the boat move from one point to an- 
other. Likewise, an isolated word is not the determining factor 
in the trend of our thought when we read. The total propelling 
and directing forces of all the words of a complete sentence or 
paragraph determine the direction and course of our conscious- 
ness. In other words, the meaning of a paragraph, for example, 
is not the sum of the mind’s reactions to isolated words so much 
as it is the total reaction of the mind to all the words acting 
together. Our reaction to a given word in a paragraph is influ-

MECHANICS AND MEANING IIL 
enced by our reactions to all the words which have gone before 
as well as to those which are to follow. Every word has a mo- 
tive force within itself which influences the trend of our thought 
in accordance with its intensity and the direction in which it 
acts ; the final result in interpretation is due just as much to the 
particular bent of our minds when the force of the word acts 
upon it. Context, therefore, exercises a very potent influence 
upon the meaning of a word. 
Practical bearing upon methods of training. The importance 
of context in influencing the meaning of words has an important 
practical bearing upon methods of training in reading. It will 
be necessary for the present only to mention the point of appli- 
cation, inasmuch as it will be the especial concern of later dis- 
cussions to deal with the subject in detail. The point is that 
the pupil in training needs to read as large amounts as possible 
of suitable reading material about all sorts of subjects. If the 
meanings of words result in any important degree from the con- 
text in which the words appear, it is necessary to provide for 
students large amounts of contextual material. 
How the school should deal with interpretation in the various 
grades. In the first chapter of this text the development of 
effective rapid silent readers was proposed as the most fitting 
aim of reading instruction in the public schools. The ability to 
get meaning from the printed page is the ability to be empha- 
sized in the training of pupils in reading. How this ability is to 
develop from grade to grade is the theme of the discussion 
which immediately follows. In general the development of this 
ability may be described by the following statements: in the 
primary grades pupils learn to attach meaning to printed 
words; in succeeding grades they receive training in deriving 
meaning from the printed page. 
The place of interpretation in primary grades; “early read- 
ing attaches meanings to words.” We have seen that the 
words we encounter in our reading or elsewhere derive their 
meanings from the reactions, the feelings, and the attitudes of
-P-A-G-E-122
  112 THE TEACHING OF READING 
mind they stir up within us. We have seen that these reactions, 
feelings, and attitudes correspond in kind, if not in degree, with 
those which are directly influenced by the objects, activities, 
etc. for which the words are the substitute. It becomes, there- 
fore, the first duty of the school to train its pupils to attach the 
appropriate reaction, feeling, or attitude to the printed word. 
The familiar pedagogical principle—‘tfrom the known to the 
related unknown”—should apply. In the primary reading les- 
son the printed word is the unknown quantity. It follows then 
that the appropriate reaction, feeling, or attitude, being the 
known quantity, should be perfectly familiar to the children 
and already a part of their experience. It should be kept in 
mind that to the unfamiliar word the child possesses no fund 
of reaction or attitude to apply, and as a consequence he is 
apt to be satisfied with the reaction of pronunciation and to 
think that is the most appropriate and desirable one. 
Provision for a wealth of reaction: objects, pictures, and the 
spoken word. If it is the business of pupils in the primary 
grades to learn to attach meanings to words, it is evident that 
their work will be simplified and become all the more effective 
in direct proportion to the amount of appropriate reaction, at- 
titude, and feeling that is a part of their experience. Accord- 
ingly the content of primary reading is an important factor 
for our consideration. Later discussions will deal specifically 
with this topic. It is sufficient for our purpose here only to state 
that familiar folk stories, Mother Goose cumulative tales, stories 
of the “woman and her pig” and “the hen found a bag of flour,” 
should supply the content of the reading material that is used as 
a basis of the work in the beginning. The more interesting the 
content is the greater will be the results in interpretation. In- 
terpretation is in proportion to the amount of personal attitude 
and reaction the pupil is able to carry over and attach to the 
printed word. 
Objects, pictures, and the spoken word are instruments to be 
used for the purpose of arousing in the pupils the desired reac-
-P-A-G-E-123
    
MECHANICS AND MEANING 113 
tion, feeling, or attitude which is to be attached to the printed 
symbol. It should always be borne in mind by the primary 
teacher that the printed word is to be connected directly with 
the appropriate reaction and only indirectly with the object, 
the picture, or the spoken word. The purpose of introduc- 
ing the object “ball,” or of showing the pupils the picture of a 
ball, is to arouse the appropriate reaction which is to be con- 
nected with the printed word “ball.” Quite often the object or 
the picture does not fulfill the purpose of the teacher, for the 
reason that the attention of the child is apt to become entirely 
occupied with it to the exclusion of attempting to make any 
connection with the printed symbol. The activity of handling 
or seeing the ball is within itself quite satisfying to the child; it 
is quite impossible for him to look at the picture of a ball and at 
the same time to take any notice of the printed word “ball.” 
We thus see that the object and the picture may operate as a 
means of distraction to the child. 
The spoken word is usually found by primary teachers to 
answer the required purpose in introducing the printed word. 
If the object, the picture, and the spoken word are familiar to 
the child, he will react with the same kind of personal attitude 
to the spoken word as to the object or picture. The spoken 
word “ball” is sufficient to arouse the same kind of pleasurable 
reaction the child is accustomed to experience when he sees and 
handles the object. It only remains to attach the pleasurable 
reaction to the printed symbol. This part of the performance 
can be accomplished without the experience of any detracting 
influence which might arise if the ball itself, or a picture of it, 
were at hand. The spoken word, of course, must refer to a 
familiar object; otherwise the only reaction it produces is the 
one of pronunciation, and this reaction, in turn, is attached to 
the printed word. In a similar connection the importance of 
context in shaping the meaning of a word should not be for- 
gotten. It is better, as indicated above, to teach words in con- 
nection with interesting content than as isolated units.
-P-A-G-E-124
  114 THE TEACHING OF READING 
The place of interpretation in succeeding grades: “in higher 
grades reading extracts meanings.” We have seen that the 
purpose of reading instruction in the primary grades is to pro- 
vide training in attaching meanings to printed words. In suc- 
ceeding grades reading instruction has an entirely different 
purpose. The training is of a different type; in these grades 
the reading process is largely reversed. 
After one has learned the art of interpreting printed words through 
the association of these words with earlier experiences the process can 
be largely reversed. The older pupil who has a stock of interpretations 
can understand the book which combines and recombines ideas and 
builds up wholly new complexes. The process of interpretation is now 
one of extracting ideas from the printed page. Thus one reads in the 
geography of a land which is always covered with ice. The word “ice” 
is familiar and the word “always” has also acquired definite meaning. 
Put the two ideas together and the pupil is carried into a world which 
is unknown but capable of being understood through the ideas acquired 
in everyday life and in the earlier grades.* 
It follows then that the content of the pupil’s reading in 
grades succeeding the primary can assume a different character 
and take on a different purpose from the ones which are appro- 
priate to his earlier reading. In the primary grades the reading 
material must express familiar ideas; in these grades the read- 
ing material can combine familiar ideas in order to express ones 
which are unfamiliar. Early reading of necessity must be within 
the fields of the pupil’s knowledge and experience ; later reading 
can, and ought to, lead the pupil out into wider and wider fields 
of experience which heretofore have been unfamiliar. In the 
primary grades the pupil reads in order to acquire the mastery 
of a valuable instrument (reading ability) ; in succeeding grades 
the pupil reads in order to make use of this instrument in ac- 
quiring useful and interesting information.

-P-A-G-E-125
  MECHANICS AND MEANING II5 
The important process of earlier grades continues. It should 
not be understood that the process of attaching meanings to 
words is to stop at the end of the primary grades, or that new 
ideas are to be borne to the pupils on the vehicles of words 
which are always entirely familiar. The process of attaching 
meaning still continues; only the method of attaching meaning 
is changed. Now the pupil finds meanings to attach to unfa- 
miliar printed symbols not in his reactions to the corresponding 
spoken words, but in the context in which the symbols are 
found, the context supplying the appropriate personal attitude 
and providing the connecting link with the heretofore unfa- 
miliar words. While we need to bear in mind that new ideas are 
now to be acquired in reading by the combination of old and 
familiar ones, we must continue to remember that day after 
day the pupil should be given the opportunity of adding new 
words to his vocabulary. To this end it is necessary that the 
pupil be provided with an abundance of contextual material 
which, though very easy in the beginning, should become 
gradually more difficult as the pupil develops in ability. The 
requirement that the reading material of these grades is to lead 
the pupil out into wider and wider fields of experience will in 
itself provide the necessary amount of progression in difficulty. 
Summary. Our discussion of interpretation has dwelt upon 
the following main points: 
1. Mental pictures, or images, are not the important facts 
in getting meaning from the printed page. “The mind is not a 
mere storehouse of images.” 
2. The mind is “‘an active organized personality responding 
with reactions to the excitations from the outer world.” The 
reactions, feelings, and attitudes which are aroused when one 
reads are the important mental facts in the apprehension of 
meaning. 
3. The context is influential in determining meaning. Mean- 
ing is determined not alone by the word itself but by the 
setting in which it is found.

116 THE TEACHING OF READING 
4. The primary grades are concerned with the task of train- 
ing pupils to attach meanings to words. 
5. The content of primary reading should be interesting and 
should deal with experiences familiar to the child. 
6. The spoken word, if familiar, answers all necessary pur- 
poses in introducing the printed word. Objects and pictures 
may serve as a means of distraction. 
7. Later grades are concerned with the task of giving train- 
ing in extracting meanings from words. The process of enlarg- 
ing the pupil’s vocabulary should continue. 
8. Later reading should lead the pupil out into wider and 
wider fields of experience. 
9. In all stages of the child’s training in reading it is impor- 
tant that he be provided with an abundance of contextual mate- 
rial. The pupil becomes an efficient reader through much 
reading. 
Ill. THE RELATION OF MECHANICS TO INTERPRETATION 
Summary of mechanics and meaning. The ability to get 
meaning from the printed page is the goal of instruction in 
reading. Only as training in the mechanics of reading bears 
upon the important process of interpretation can such training 
be justified. In our discussion of the importance of mechanics 
we have seen to what extent mechanical training is necessary 
in order to assist pupils in avoiding periods of confusion which 
operate as means of distraction to the process of thought- 
getting. The difficulty of the mechanical phase of reading was 
pointed out and the necessity of a complete mastery of me- 
chanics was emphasized. Throughout our whole discussion of 
the present and of the preceding chapter the inference has been 
very plain that the mechanical phase of the reading process 
needs to be mastered by the pupil as early as possible and as 
thoroughly as possible in order that he may be free to devote 
his whole attention to the one important process of reading— 
 
-P-A-G-E-127
  MECHANICS AND MEANING TE 
getting the thought—without delay and without distraction. 
Professor Judd’s chapter on “Reading for Meaning” is very 
clear upon this point. We quote at length from his discussion: 
Shift of attention from mechanics to interpretation. The change in 
the character of the reading matter which has been sketched in the 
foregoing paragraphs is intimately related to a shift in emphasis from 
the mechanical side of reading to the interpretative side. In the early 
grades the mind of the pupil is largely absorbed in seeing words and in 
attaching meanings to them. In the later grades the process of seeing 
words is so perfected that attention is freed to concentrate on inter- 
pretation, 
The probability is very great that the mechanical requirements are 
mastered by many pupils very much faster than is ordinarily assumed. 
It is probably not necessary to do more than set a pupil on the right 
track and then supply him with material appropriate to his interest. He 
will acquire the higher technique of reading through much reading. 
The present practice of continuing drill in the mechanics of reading 
throughout the elementary school undoubtedly retards pupils rather 
than helps them. 
Overemphasis in schools on the mechanics of reading. Many a pupil 
leaves school equipped with the mechanical ability to read words but 
utterly unacquainted with the possibility of interpretation. School 
reading has been a formal ceremony for the pupil. He has formed the 
habit of thinking that words have been adequately dealt with when 
they have been sounded. The fault is with the school’s selection of 
reading matter and with the school’s emphasis on mere mechanical 
perfection in oral reading. 
Formalism due to overemphasis on adult Reece The time will 
come when the reading matter will not be of the formal type now 
common in schools. The reading matter in the lower grades will be so 
selected as to induct the pupil gradually into the intricacies of the 
interpretative process. Emphasis on interpretation will be so graded as 
to use the pupil’s power as fast as it is cultivated. Put in terms of par- 
ticular grades, this means that for the first three years the pupil will 
read stories and familiar matter made up of phonetically simple words. 
Concrete material dealing with new but definite experiences will be 
presented in the fourth, fifth, and sixth grades. Reading matter should 
appeal to concrete interests and should stimulate the more intelligent 
approach to new ideas in books. Reading selections should be drawn 
   
-P-A-G-E-128
  118 THE TEACHING OF READING 
from science as well as from literary classics. At the present time there 
is overemphasis on mature adult literary interests, and consequently 
reading becomes formal and lacks contact with real life. 
This plea will be regarded by some people as a crass attack on the 
classical literature of our language. It is not. If one would have pupils 
read literature the worst possible mistake is to force them at too early 
a period to read anything that is abstract. Reading must be developed 
by the expenditure of much time and effort. Subject matter must be 
vivid and concrete in the middle grades if words are to have meaning 
and if réading is to be more than a formal process. 
Later grades have to do with individual interests. The pupil who has 
had much reading up to the sixth grade and has all along been kept in 
contact with meanings, first by the selection of familiar matter and 
afterward by the selection of vivid concrete material, will arrive at 
the beginning of the adolescent period with a mastery of the technique 
of reading and with an interest in interpretation which may safely be 
relied on to guide him through the more intricate problems of reading 
in the upper grades and high school. . . . 
Mechanics should be mastered early... . Under ideal conditions 
the mechanics of reading are disposed of very early and the pupil is 
encouraged to improve in speed and accuracy by the natural incentives 
growing out of his desire to get meanings more readily from the books 
with which he comes in contact. There ought to be no serious problem 
of mechanics in the upper grades and at the same time there ought to 
be continuous improvement. The unit of recognition should continually 
be enlarged. 
Unfortunately these ideal conditions do not always exist. As has 
been shown in earlier chapters, many readers are so clumsy in their read- 
ing methods that they are continually distracting themselves and losing 
the meaning of passages in the sheer effort to get the words. The middle 
grades are full of readers who cannot devote their attention to interpre- 
tation because they are tangled up in the process of seeing the words. 
Like every other failure the failure to dispose of mechanics when 
they should be disposed of is expensive. How expensive the failure is 
can hardly be estimated until one begins to think of the pupils who 
leave school unaware of the value of the art of reading and of the 
pupils who fall behind in their studies because they cannot read.t

  MECHANICS AND MEANING IIQ 
Summary. 1. Mechanics. Emphasis on mechanics is an 
important phase of reading instruction. Mechanics should be 
made as easy as possible by being made as automatic as possible. 
2. Interpretation. Interpretation is the end of all instruction 
in reading. For the sake of acquiring skill in interpretation the 
pupil should be provided at first with an abundance of easy 
familiar reading material and later with an abundance of in- 
teresting concrete material. 
3. Relation of mechanics to interpretation. Reading instruc- 
tion should provide for an early mastery of mechanics.

CHAPTER VIII 
THE BALANCE BETWEEN SPEED AND COMPREHENSION 
A continuation of the preceding discussion. In this chapter 
the discussion of the two chapters just preceding will be con- 
tinued. The theme of the present chapter is in effect only a 
slight variation of the one we have been discussing. The rela- 
tionship between the topics “speed and comprehension” and 
“mechanics and meaning” is evident. We are accustomed to 
think of “speed” and “comprehension” as expressions of some- 
what indefinite degrees of ability which have been attained in 
“mechanics” and “getting the meaning,” respectively. To say 
that a student reads with speed and comprehension is a recogni- 
tion of the fact that the student has been able to reach a cer- 
tain mastery of the mechanics of reading and has attained a 
certain degree of proficiency in interpretation. In preceding 
chapters the terms “mechanics” and “meaning” have been used 
to refer to characteristics of the reading process ; in the present 
chapter the terms “speed” and “comprehension” will be used 
in referring to corresponding characteristics of reading ability. 
The similarity between the themes of this and of the two 
chapters immediately preceding will be preserved in the organi- 
zation of the main lines of the discussion of the present chapter. 
The former discussion centered around three topics: (1) the 
importance of emphasis on mechanics, (2) interpretation, and 
(3) the relation between mechanics and meaning. Likewise, 
the present discussion will bear upon three topics of somewhat 
similar organization; namely, (1) the importance of speed, 
(2) comprehension, and (3) the relation between speed and 
comprehension. The first topic will discuss speed from the 
120
-P-A-G-E-131
  SPEED AND COMPREHENSION 121 
standpoints of the need of rapid reading in modern life, of the 
very wide individual differences among pupils in the rate of 
reading, ard of the development in rate from grade to grade. 
The second topic will relate itself to the question of progress 
through the grades in ability to interpret what is read. The 
third topic will seek to show that speed and comprehension 
are not antagonistic qualities, but that they are capable of 
coordinate development. 
I, THE IMPORTANCE OF SPEED 
Speed is an important characteristic of reading ability. In 
preceding chapters we have had called to our attention the fact 
that speed is an important characteristic of reading ability. It 
has been pointed out repeatedly, both directly and by implica- 
tion, that the social needs of the present day in our complex 
democratic society require an ever-increasing amount of read- 
ing on the part of the citizens of this government. Reading 
material is abundant. A considerable amount of reading is 
necessary in all walks of life. No longer is the art of reading 
the peculiar possession of the scholar. No longer is training in 
reading the opportunity and social requirement of the favored 
few. Such a condition existed in a day when there was no daily 
newspaper or weekly periodical or favorite monthly magazine 
to be read; when the Bible, Wigglesworth’s “Day of Doom,” 
and the almanac constituted the full extent of one’s reading. 
Now the common man is able to read, and he does read to an 
extent which it is hardly possible to estimate. Because of the 
requirements of modern life and of the opportunities which it 
affords for a large amount of reading, speed of reading is an 
important characteristic for consideration. The consideration 
of speed, therefore, holds an important place in our statement 
of the aim of reading instruction. The kind of reading to be 
emphasized in our schools is defined by the phrase “effective 
rapid silent reading.”
-P-A-G-E-132
  122 THE TEACHING OF READING 
Notwithstanding the importance which by right belongs to 
considerations of speed, we find that hardly any effort has ever 
been devoted to training pupils in rapid reading. About the 
only time speed is held up to the attention of pupils is when the 
teacher cautions not to read too fast. Only then is the idea 
ever conveyed to pupils that speed is a factor worthy of con- 
sideration. Teachers as a rule are entirely unconscious of any 
importance that may be attached to reading rate. The fact that 
the pupils of a given grade read with any considerable variation 
in speed is viewed by a great number of teachers with startling 
perplexity when the matter is called to their attention. Indeed, 
the variation in rate by pupils of supposedly equal attainments 
and ability is quite commonly of such an extent as to give pause 
to even the most thorough student of reading and of reading 
methods. Let us consider a few such variations. 
Individual differences in rate of reading. Twenty-four pupils 
in a third-grade class were tested as to their rates of reading 
silently an easy passage selected from their readers. The total 
time required for each pupil to read the passage was carefully 
taken, and the number of words read per second was computed. 
The slowest pupil read at the rate of .o of a word per second; 
the most rapid at the rate of 5.1 words per second. The average 
rate for the class was 2.2 words. The range in rate of the middle 
50 per cent of the class—which, of course, does not include the 
25 per cent who were very slow readers or the 25 per cent who 
were very rapid—was from 1.4 words per second to 3.2 words 
per second. 
A similar test was given to twenty-five members of a sixth- 
grade class in the silent reading of a passage suitable to their 
age and attainments. The rate of the slowest reader was 1.4 
words per second; that of the most rapid, 4.4 words. The aver- 
age rate was 2.9 words, and the range in rate of the middle 
50 per cent was from 2.4 to 3.3 words per second. 
Twenty members of the writer’s class in “special methods” 
were tested as to the rate of reading a selection from Klapper’s
-P-A-G-E-133
  SPEED AND COMPREHENSION 123 
“Teaching Children to Read.” The class is more or less 
a selected group, being made up of seniors in a normal 
school, and the members are presumed to equal each other 
in ability and attainments. The results of the test follow: 
lowest rate, 2 words; highest rate, 4.8 words; average rate, 
3.4 words; range of the middle 50 per cent, 2.9 words to 
4 words per second. 
The most striking feature of the results which are quoted 
above is the very wide variation in rate of reading by pupils of 
supposedly equal attainments and ability. Individual differ- 
ences in ability to carry on the prescribed work of the school 
are, of course, always to be expected. On the other hand, such 
differences in speed of reading between the slowest and the 
most rapid as 460 per cent for third-grade pupils, more than 
200 per cent for sixth-grade pupils, and 140 per cent for a 
selected group of normal-school students can hardly be cred- 
ited with belonging within the bounds of normal expectation. 
Conditions other than ordinary differences in individual capac- 
ity must be sought to explain such wide variation. Professor 
Gray attributes the cause to the more or less unsystematic 
methods of teaching silent reading which prevail in the 
schools: 
This [the fact that rate of silent reading is found to vary more widely 
than oral reading achievement] may be explained in part by the fact 
that the technique of teaching oral reading has received intensive 
study for generations. As a result, elaborate systems of teaching 
beginners in reading have been developed. The details of these systems 
have been worked out so carefully that the work of each year, month, 
and week has been definitely outlined. When large numbers of teachers 
follow these suggestions consistently, it is not very surprising that the 
pupils approximate the same levels of achievement. In the case of 
silent reading, however, very little attention has been given to the 
problem. Few methods for securing effective results have been worked 
out and generally adopted. As a consequence, teachers devote very 
little time to specific instruction in habits of silent reading. The wide 
variation in results, particularly in the lower grades, suggests the neces-
-P-A-G-E-134
  I24 THE TEACHING OF READING 
sity of giving special attention to methods of teaching silent reading 
until a series of exercises has been worked out for securing effective 
results,t 
The need of systematizing instruction in silent reading is 
very plain. The importance of speed as a consideration for 
teachers of reading is brought out in the wide variations in rate 
which have been enumerated. 
Speed is a measure of ability in the mechanics. Speed of 
reading is an important characteristic for the consideration of 
teachers because it is a very reliable measure of a pupil’s pro- 
ficiency in the mechanics. The pupil who reads slowly and 
laboriously does so because the mere mechanics of reading pre- 
sent to him very important features of difficulty, whereas the 
pupil who reads rapidly is able to do so because he has acquired 
a mastery of mechanics. The exceptions to this general rule 
are the slow readers who neglect speed in favor of comprehen- 
sion and the very rapid readers who are inclined to skip the 
mechanical features which give them difficulty. The excep- 
tions are few in number, however, and the general rule prevails 
that the reader’s ability in the mechanics is indicated by his 
reading rate. 
Speed increases rapidly in the lower grades; in the upper 
grades it approaches a maximum. Progress through the grades 
in rate of silent reading has been studied in great detail by 
Professor Gray through the use of his standardized reading 
tests. The progress of 2654 pupils in rate of silent reading, 
representing thirteen city-school systems, is shown in Fig. 10. 
Since these selections were used in order to adapt the subject matter 
to the maturity of pupils of different grades, a readjustment was neces- 
sary in the diagram. The points of this readjustment are between the 
third and fourth grades and between the sixth and seventh grades. A 
dotted line is drawn in the diagram dividing the curves of progress at

these points. The figures at the left of the diagram indicate the num- 
ber of words read per second when the easy selection was read; the 
figures on the line between the third and fourth grades indicate the 
equivalent number of words read per second when the second selection 
was used; and the figures on the line between the sixth and seventh 
grades indicate the equivalent rate for the most difficult selection.1

Fig. 1o shows that speed of silent reading increases very 
rapidly in the lower grades and at a much lower rate in the 
middle and upper grades. For example, the progress in rate in 
the third and fourth grades is the equivalent of three times the 
progress made in the two grades which succeed the fourth, and

-P-A-G-E-136
  126 THE TEACHING OF READING 
is one and one-half times the progress made in the last four 
grades of the school. The matter can be stated in another way. 
Four years of work following the fourth grade are required to 
effect the same progress in rate as that which is made in one 
and one-half years which immediately precede. Progress in the 
second, third, and fourth grades is very rapid; in the fifth and 
sixth grades progress is considerable, although not rapid; be- 
yond the sixth grade progress is not marked, but appears to be 
approaching a limit. 
The very rapid progress which takes place in the early grades 
is to be explained by the fact that there is a very rapid mastery 
of the mechanical difficulties of reading and a corresponding 
increase in the ability to fixate in larger and larger units. By 
the time the fourth or fifth grade is reached the mechanics of 
reading may be said to be mastered; little additional ability in 
mechanics is attained beyond these grades. Consequently one 
would be led to expect little if any progress in speed to be 
carried over into the later grades of the school. What progress 
does result in the grades following the fourth is due almost 
entirely to the ability of pupils to read in larger and more 
meaningful fixation units. When this ability ceases to develop, 
progress in speed reaches a standstill. The importance of spe- 
cial training for intermediate-grade pupils in the ability to read 
in larger and larger units of fixation is clearly evident. 
Speed may be emphasized to advantage in the early grades. 
The average attainments in rate of silent reading of pupils in 
the various grades of a large number of cities have been com- 
pared. In the grades preceding the sixth very wide variations 
in average rate have been found to be quite common, but in 
the grades following the sixth the variations become smaller 
and smaller. Of the comparison and variations Gray writes as 
follows: 
. . . Progress continues in the upper grades of the elementary school, 
although this progress is not marked beyond the 6th grade. These facts 
harmonize with the conclusions reached by Courtis and others that a 
 
-P-A-G-E-137
  SPEED AND COMPREHENSION 1277 
pupil’s habits in regard to rate of careful silent reading are established 
for the most part by the end of the 6th grade. It is evident, therefore, 
that the 3d, 4th, and sth grades represent a period in which rate of silent 
reading may be emphasized to advantage. Furthermore, it should be 
noted that the pupils of different schools approximate in the upper grades 
the same average ability in rate of silent reading, although they may 
differ widely in this regard in the lower grades. Since silent reading is 
the chief means by which a pupil secures ideas for himself during the 
intermediate grades, it stands to reason that the school which attains a 
relatively rapid rate in the lower intermediate grades will have a distinct 
advantage, other things being equal, over the schools which do not attain 
an equal rate until the 6th or 7th grades. Economy in education de- 
mands, therefore, that effective habits of silent reading be acquired as 
early in the school life of the child as possible.t 
The point to be kept in mind for use in later discussions, as 
well as for application in schoolroom practice, is that the pupil 
who has mastered the mechanics of reading in the lower grades 
sufficiently to read with a marked degree of speed possesses an 
immense advantage over the pupil who is retarded in his mas- 
tery of mechanics to the extent of not being able to read with a 
reasonable degree of speed before the later grades of the school. 
The need of an early mastery of mechanics is therefore an im- 
portant point to be emphasized in the more practical discus- 
sions of the third part of this book. 
II. COMPREHENSION 
Ability to interpret progresses uniformly from grade to 
grade. The normal progress in ability to interpret what is read 
appears to be fairly uniform through the grades. The average 
comprehension scores in silent reading of 2654 pupils, repre- 
senting thirteen city-school systems, are shown in Fig. 11. The 
scores shown are average per-cent grades made in answer to 
questions and in oral or written discussion on the thoughts

expressed in the test paragraphs. Fig. 11 contains readjust- 
ments similar to those described in connection with Fig. 10 and 
should be similarly interpreted. 
Fig. 11 shows uniform progress in ability to interpret up to 
and including the fifth grade. In the sixth grade progress is con- 
siderably increased, and in the seventh and eighth grades the de- 
gree of progress returns to that which prevailed before the sixth 
grade. The sudden increase in the sixth grade is of interest.

of Elementary-School Reading through Standardized Tests,” by William 
Scott Gray) 
Rapid improvement in quality of silent reading at the outset is due 
to the fact that pupils rapidly acquire skill in using reading as a tool for 
securing ideas. Habits of attention are developed rapidly and methods 
of study are constantly refined. During the intermediate and grammar 
grades a pupil reads widely and with a purpose. The result is that his 
world of meanings is greatly enlarged. Furthermore, habits of study 
are constantly improved so that the pupil reads with increasing effec- 
tiveness.*

  SPEED AND COMPREHENSION 129 
There are no facts at hand which may be used to explain the 
quite sudden increase in progress which occurs in the sixth 
grade. The increase may be due to the beginning in this grade 
of special emphasis upon the interpretative phase of reading. 
That the increase did not arise in an earlier intermediate grade 
may be explained by the fact that it is the common practice 
among teachers to stress the mechanical phase of reading in- 
struction even into the upper grades of the school. 
A prominent discussion of the preceding chapter is here rein- 
troduced: To what extent is it necessary to emphasize instruc- 
tion in the mechanics of reading? When should the emphasis 
be shifted to the phase of interpretation? In short, what rela- 
tion should be established between mechanics and meaning? 
The answer of the preceding chapter was that mechanics should 
receive the emphasis in the early grades of the school in order 
that the pupil may be enabled at the earliest possible moment to 
direct the major part of his attention toward getting the mean- 
ing. The dependence of the ability to get the meaning upon a 
mastery of the mechanics was the important theme that ran 
through all the discussion of the chapters on “mechanics and 
meaning.” Let us see how this relationship manifests itself in 
the discussion which follows. 
Ill. THE RELATION BETWEEN SPEED AND 
COMPREHENSION 
The supposed antagonism between speed and comprehension. 
The common conception which prevails among teachers with 
respect to the relation between speed and comprehension is 
that the two characteristics are mutually antagonistic. The 
person who reads rapidly necessarily neglects the meaning; 
likewise, in order to secure the greatest amount of meaning one 
is obliged to read slowly. Such a belief originates, no doubt, in 
the failure of most teachers to make any distinction between 
the close application which should prevail when one studies and 
 
-P-A-G-E-140
  130 THE TEACHING OF READING 
the ordinary reading of stories, magazine articles, newspapers, 
etc. When one studies a difficult selection from a textbook the 
common belief is that it is necessary to read very slowly and 
carefully in order to secure the fullest amount of meaning; 
hence the inference that slow rate and ability to comprehend 
are intimately related. In addition, the failure of a great many 
schools and teachers to emphasize the importance of a large 
amount of reading on the part of the pupils is a considerable 
factor in shaping the common prevailing belief. Because the 
large majority of our pupils are not required, and have never 
been given the training, to read widely in the concrete materials 
of history, geography, nature study, hygiene, etc., the discus- 
sions of the textbooks in these subjects are necessarily very 
abstract and difficult of understanding. As a consequence slow 
reading of these textbooks is necessary for the pupils to secure 
even a modicum of understanding of the statements which are 
contained in them. There is little wonder then that the pre- 
vailing belief is that slow reading and ability to comprehend 
are intimately related, and that rapid reading and ability to 
comprehend are mutually antagonistic. The problem which 
now confronts us is to determine to what extent this prevailing 
belief among teachers is justified. The discussion which follows 
attacks that problem. 
The general relation between speed and comprehension. The 
following paragraphs by Quantz discuss the general relationship 
between speed-and comprehension: 
Rapid readers remember more of the original thought, and the char- 
acter of their reproductions is much higher, both generally and with 
reference to expression and logical content. 
It might be supposed that greater rapidity was gained at the sacrifice 
of exactness or of intelligence. This supposition is negatived by an 
examination of the amount and quantity of the material reproduced. 
A comparison between the ten most rapid readers and the ten slowest 
shows that the rapid readers remember more of the original thoughts, 
and that the character of their reproduction is much higher, both gen-
-P-A-G-E-141
  
SPEED AND COMPREHENSION 131 
erally and with reference to expression and logical content. In the audi- 
tory tests the ratio of slow to rapid readers is 14.8 per cent to 20.7 per 
cent in the number of thoughts. In quality the percentages are 47.8 for 
slow readers, 60.3 for fast. The same comparison in the visual tests 
results as follows: percentage of thoughts reproduced by slow readers, 
14.9; by rapid, 24.4. Quality: slow, 48 per cent; rapid, 73.3 per cent.t 
In a survey of the Cleveland schools the speed and compre- 
hension records of 1831 Cleveland pupils were divided into 
three groups each: for speed, the 25 per cent of the records 
which were most rapid were classed as “rapid”; the 25 per cent 
which were slowest were classed as “slow”; the remaining mid- 
dle 50 per cent were classed as “medium.” In like manner the 
comprehension records were classified: 25 per cent were classed 
as “good,” 50 per cent as “medium,” and 25 per cent as “poor.” 
Any individual record then was obliged to fall into one of the 
following nine classes: 
Rapid speed and 
good quality 
Rapid speed and 
medium quality 
Rapid speed and 
poor quality Medium speed and 
good quality 
Medium speed and 
medium quality 
Medium speed and 
poor quality 
To quote the Survey report?: Slow speed and 
good quality 
Slow speed and 
medium quality 
Slow speed and 
poor quality 
It becomes a very simple matter to assign all records in each grade 
  to the appropriate class and determine the percentage of the grade which 
falls into this class.* [Fig. 12]* gives the results, the percentages being 
in each case the nearest whole number to the calculated figures, and the 
size of the circle being proportionate to the size of the class indicated. 
*In making up the tables whole numbers only were used and pupils of like 
standing were not separated. This throws the percentages somewhat out of 
exact conformity to the scheme. The error, however, is very slight.

These figures serve to emphasize the fact that good readers are 
usually not slow and poor readers are usually not fast.1 It is evidently 
not safe to attempt to lay down any absolute rule. There are good readers 
who are slow. In some cases such readers may be temperamentally 
slow. But even making allowances for such individual peculiarities, the 
figures show that good reading and slow reading are not incompatible.

Schools,” by C. H. Judd) 
In like manner there are a certain number of children who read rapidly 
but retain little of what they read. With the figures in hand a teacher 
can profitably study her class and determine . . . what are the special 
explanations of each individual type of ability. 
For the purpose of this survey the general fact that high rate and 
good quality are commonly related, and that low rate and poor quality 
are commonly related, is of great importance.

SPEED AND COMPREHENSION 133 
The foregoing quotations from reports of investigations into 
the relationship between speed of reading and comprehension 
impress one with the fact that an intimate relationship exists 
between the two characteristics. “Good readers are usually not 
slow and poor readers are usually not fast” is the rule that 
impresses itself upon the student of such investigations and 
upon the close observer of reading in the schoolroom. On the 
other hand, any statement of the relation between speed and 
comprehension is compelled to take into account the fact that 
there are pupils who fail to get the proper amount of meaning 
from the printed page because they read too rapidly, while 
others are very able in comprehension because they read slowly 
and with great attention to meaning. Such exceptions to the 
relation one usually finds to exist between speed and compre- 
hension will be referred to a little further along in the discus- 
sion. For the present let us direct our attention to the reasons 
why “high rate and good quality are commonly related” and 
why “low rate and poor quality are commonly related.” 
The slow reader is usually distracted by mechanical difficul- 
ties. It has been pointed out in a preceding paragraph that the 
rate of one’s reading is an index of his ability in the mechanics. 
To read with speed usually indicates that the pupil has sur- 
mounted the important mechanical difficulties, whereas the 
pupil who reads slowly and laboriously is compelled to do so 
because the mechanical difficulties which are encountered are 
constantly interrupting the reading process. Thus we have an 
important explanation of the general relation between speed 
and comprehension. The attention of the slow reader is so 
taken with what is to him the difficult and laborious process of 
reading that he has very little to give to interpretation. On the 
other hand, practically the whole attention of the rapid reader 
can be given to interpretation, because he can read so well that 
little effort is needed in carrying on the mechanical process. 
The rapid reader usually secures meanings in wholes rather 
than in parts. Not only is the rapid reader the better able to
-P-A-G-E-144
    
134 THE TEACHING OF READING 
devote the whole of his attention and energy to the task of in- 
terpretation; he also has a greater opportunity than the slow 
reader of welding together into one composite whole the sepa- 
rate and constituent meanings of the various sentences and 
paragraphs which go to make it up. The meaning of a para- 
graph, for example, cannot be had by a separate consideration 
of the meanings of its various sentences. The meanings of the 
various sentences need to be considered as component parts 
of a larger unity. Only as the meaning of each particular sen- 
tence is colored and defined by its relation to the meanings of 
all the other sentences does it have any value that is peculiarly 
its own. In order to have established this proper relation be- 
tween the component meanings of a paragraph, it is necessary 
that the various meanings have at about the same time the 
right of way in the forefront of the reader’s atention. This 
the rapid reader has the better opportunity of providing, be- 
cause of the natural limitations of one’s immediate memory, 
spoken of by Huey as the primary memory of the inner speech. 
Says Huey: 
It is of the greatest service to the reader or listener that at each 
moment a considerable amount of what is being read should hang sus- 
pended in the primary memory of the inner speech. It is doubtless true 
that without something of this there could be no comprehension of 
speech at all. When a considerable amount is thus suspended, the atten- 
tion may wander backward and forward to get a fuller meaning where 
this is needed, with no fear of losing the minor parts, which are taken 
care of physiologically and may be taken into the focus of consciousness 
at will.t 
A much more lucid explanation is to be found in “How to 
Read,” by J. B. Kerfoot. He asks the following questions: 
(1) Why is it impracticable to ‘examine the meanings we are giving 
to words as we read them’?

  SPEED AND COMPREHENSION 135 
(2) Why is it impossible to “read” if we do stop to examine the 
meanings we are giving to individual words ? 
(3) What is the actual way in which we do control our word inter- 
pretations ? 
His answer, which follows, likens the reading process to a 
motion-picture exhibition: 
Let us glance back for a moment at the cinematograph. 
You know, of course, that a motion-picture film is made up of a 
great number of individual photographs. That these were originally 
taken separately, but in rapid succession. That they are thrown on the 
screen, also separately, and in the original order, and at the original 
rapid rate—as a matter of fact, at the rate of about twenty per second. 
And you quite understand (although you cannot detect the fact for 
yourselves by observation) that it is precisely because each of these 
separate pictures is actually there, stationary, on the screen, long 
enough for us to perceive it, yet is always succeeded by another picture 
(ever so slightly different) too quickly for us to differentiate the impres- 
sions we receive from them, that the series merges, to our minds, into 
a “moving picture.” 
Now the significant fact that I wish to point out to you—the fact 
that is going to enable us to “hitch up” our previous discoveries to the 
facts of actual reading practice—is this: that the separate words on a 
page of print correspond exactly to the separate pictures of a movie 
film. 
It is not merely true in a sort of metaphorical sense that “reading” 
results in ‘mental movies.” 
It is literally true that the mental mechanics of the two processes 
are identical. 
Let us examine them. 
The cinematograph is operated at the rate of about twenty pictures 
per second. In other words, in one minute of the movies something 
like twelve hundred pictures, one after the other, twenty to the second, 
are thrown on the screen before our eyes. 
On the other hand, an ordinary reader takes about a minute to read 
an average page of the usual novel. Such a page contains in the neigh- 
borhood of three hundred words. Which is to say that in one minute 
of “reading” something like three hundred words, one after the other, 
five to the second, are flashed onto the sensitized screen of the mind.
-P-A-G-E-146
  136 THE TEACHING OF READING 
And, in this case as in the other, it is precisely because each of these 
words is there, stationary, before our moving eyes, just long enough for 
us to feel the flavor of its significance, but is always—before we have 
time to differentiate the impressions made on us—abandoned for an- 
other word, different, yet either qualifying or qualified by the first one, 
that the series merges in our minds into the living flux of “representa- 
tion” or “understanding” that we call “reading,” and that we have 
elected to describe as a “mental movie.” 
Here, then, are our first two points already clear to us: 
(1) At five words to the second it is obviously impossible to ‘examine 
the meanings we are giving to the words as we read them.” 
(2) Yet if, in order to make such an examination possible, we slow 
down to, say, ten words to the minute, we instantly destroy the cinemato- 
graphic effect of the merged series. Instead of a “mental movie” we get 
a “jumble of unrelated meanings, memories, associations and ideas.” 
In exactly the same way, if we slow a movie film down until each 
picture remains on the screen for two whole seconds, and is then, after 
an interval of darkness, succeeded, for two whole seconds more, by 
the next picture, we instantly turn.a “moving picture” into a proces- 
sion of meaningless monotony. 
In both cases we have a watched pot that never boils.1 
In other words, the slow reader has difficulty in getting the 
proper “motion-picture” effect. 
The discussion may be disposed of with the following sum- 
mary: The rapid reader is engaged with the meaning of the 
latter part of a paragraph while the meaning of the first part is 
still fresh in his mind, whereas the slow reader may forget the 
meaning of the first part of a paragraph before he has com- 
pleted the reading of the latter part. The rapid reader has the 
opportunity to weld together in his mind all phases of meaning 
which are expressed in a paragraph; the slow reader does not 
have an equal chance. 
Thus far in our discussion we have considered the general 
relation between speed and comprehension, and, finding it to be

quite intimate, we have turned our attention briefly to the 
explanations. We turn now to a consideration of the exceptions 
to the general relation between the two important characteris- 
tics of silent reading. Our purpose is to seek an explanation of 
the conditions under which speed and comprehension develop as 
seemingly antagonistic rather than mutually related qualities.

of silent reading of Cleveland pupils in all grades is shown.

scores in comprehension. Here it is shown that the pupils of 
Cleveland in all grades are markedly inferior in quality of silent

reading to the pupils of the other cities. The results of a com- 
parison of the facts presented in the two figures appear to 
stand out in sharp contrast with our previous conclusions re- 
garding the general relation between speed and comprehension. 
Here we find that as the speed of Cleveland pupils tends to 
rise above the average of other cities there is a corresponding 
tendency of the comprehension scores to fall below the average. 
Cleveland pupils rank high in speed and low in comprehension.

These comparative facts raise a most important question. Does quality 
of reading always fall when the rate rises? Is the result which we find 
for Cleveland as contrasted with other cities merely an expression of 
the general opposition between quality and quantity such as was found 
in the case of handwriting ?+

  SPEED AND COMPREHENSION 139 
In addition to the task of seeking an answer to the questions 
just quoted, we are confronted with the problem of explaining 
how Cleveland pupils, who are rapid, are less able in interpre- 
tation than the pupils of other schools whose scores in rate of 
reading are not quite so good. 
Explanation of the Cleveland record. The solution of the 
problem is stated by Professor Judd in terms of the relative 
emphasis on speed and comprehension in the different grades. 
Notwithstanding the close relationship between speed and 
comprehension and the fact that the two characteristics are 
capable of codrdinate development, it is necessary for us always 
to remember that emphasis upon the two characteristics in un- 
equal amounts results in an overdevelopment of the one at the 
expense of progress in the other. The matter is brought out in 
Judd’s discussion: 
The problem which is here encountered is solved by a consideration 
of the relative emphasis on speed and quality in the different grades. 
Rate and quality may be represented in a single diagram. Thus in 
[Fig. 15] the rate of reading is represented by horizontal distances 
and quality by vertical distances. . . . Here we see that the rate of the 
second grade in Cleveland is about two words per second while the 
speed of the corresponding grade in other cities is about one and a half 
per second. The quality of Cleveland’s second grades, on the other 
hand, is 25, while that of the grades in other cities is over 30. 
Following the progress of the Cleveland curve, it is noticed that 
there is a rapid gain in speed up to the fourth grade, shown by the fact 
that the curve turns sharply toward the right but is irregular in the 
vertical. Quality is thus shown to be irregular. There is a relapse to a 
lower level in passing from the third to the fourth grade. Indeed, even 
after improvement in quality begins in the fifth and sixth grades, it is 
relatively slow and irregular. 
The curve for the other cities has a wholly different character. Dur- 
ing the early years rate improves relatively more than does quality, 
but there is steady progress in both. In the middle of the elementary 
course there is a definite change in relation, the upper grades showing 
greater improvement in quality. This would seem to mean that the 
mechanical phases of reading have to be mastered first, and their mas-
-P-A-G-E-150
  140 THE TEACHING OF READING 
tery is shown by the attainment of satisfactory speed; thereafter the 
greater emphasis should fall on quality. 
The solution of our problem regarding the high speed and deficient 
quality of Cleveland is now clear. There is not sufficient attention to 
interpretation in the grades up to the fourth. There is, indeed, a high 
degree of success in perfecting the mechanical operations, but the ulti- 
mate achievement of the schools is below what it should be in quality 
because the quality is not adequately stressed in the lower grades.t

necessity of an early mastery of the mechanical phases of reading. 
Summary and conclusions. This will conclude our discus- 
sion of the balance between speed and comprehension. In the 
chapter we have arrived at the following conclusions: 
1. That rapid reading is very necessary in our complex demo- 
cratic society.

2. That there exists among pupils very wide individual dif- 
ferences in rate of silent reading. 
3. That ability to surmount the mechanical difficulties of 
reading, indicated by a reasonable degree of speed, is necessary 
before pupils are able to make any considerable progress in 
interpretation. 
4. That special-attention to specific devices of instruction in 
silent reading is needed; that it is important for teachers to 
give their attention to the problem of systematizing instruction 
in silent reading. 
5. That special attention needs to be devoted to the interpre- 
tative phase of reading. 
6. That “good readers are usually not slow and poor readers 
are usually not fast.” 
7. That speed and comprehension are capable of coérdinate 
development. 
8. That either characteristic may develop at the expense of 
progress in the other unless special emphasis is placed on a 
codrdinate development of both.

CHAPTER Ix 
ORAL AND SILENT READING 
The discussion of the reading process concluded. The pres- 
ent chapter will conclude our discussion of the reading process 
by pointing out the relation of instruction in oral reading to 
instruction in silent reading. Thus far our discussion of the 
reading process has related itself almost exclusively to silent 
reading; the relation to oral reading has been purposely neg- 
lected in order not to distract our attention from the aim of 
reading instruction which was set up in Chapter I. We turn our 
attention now to a discussion of the reading process as it is 
related to oral reading. Because of the high favor which educa- 
tional practice has always accorded to oral reading, it is well 
now for a time to make that phase of the reading process the 
subject of explicit discussion. We shall not lose sight, however, 
of the ultimate aim of reading instruction—to develop effective 
rapid silent readers—to the extent of pursuing our discussion of 
oral reading beyond the bounds of its relationship to instruc- 
tion in silent reading. It is an important purpose of the present 
chapter, therefore, to determine to what extent instruction in 
oral reading may help and to what extent it may hinder in- 
struction in silent reading. 
Oral and silent reading are characteristically different proc- 
esses. Any discussion of the relation of instruction in oral read- 
ing to instruction in silent reading must take into account as a 
primary consideration the fact that the two processes are 
characteristically different. A proper recognition of this differ- 
ence has an important bearing, as we shall see, upon the rela- 
tive emphasis which ought to be given to the two types of 
143  
-P-A-G-E-154
  144 THE TEACHING OF READING 
reading instruction through the grades. A review of the char- 
acteristic eye-movement habits of an adult in oral and silent 
reading is pertinent at this point in our discussion. For the 
purpose of a review let us return to an examination of Figs. 2 
and 3, which are presented in Chapter IV. 
The differences between the two processes, oral and silent 
reading, as revealed in the record of eye movement in silent 
reading in Fig. 2 and in the record for oral reading in Fig. 3, 
are quite clear. The characteristic habits of the two proc- 
esses stand out in sharp contrast whether we view them from 
the standpoint of the number of pauses to the line, of the 
duration of the pauses, or from the standpoint of the size of 
the units of recognition. In oral reading (Fig. 3) the number 
of the pauses is greater than in silent reading (Fig. 2), and 
the average length of the pauses is greater. Not taking into 
account in either case the opening and closing lines of the 
paragraph read, we find that the number of the pauses in oral 
reading exceeds by more than 70 per cent the number in silent 
reading, and that 13 per cent more time is consumed on the aver- 
age in an oral-reading pause than ina silent-reading pause. The 
unit of recognition in silent reading is broader than the unit of 
recognition and articulation in oral reading. In silent reading 
the unit of fixation is often the meaningful phrase, while in oral 
reading it is usually the word. 
The purpose of the process determines its character. The 
explanation of the difference in the characteristics of oral and 
silent reading is to be had in an examination of the purposes of 
each type of reading process. The purpose of silent reading is 
to secure meaning ; the purpose of oral reading is articulation— 
pronunciation of words with proper expression. We have seen 
in previous discussions, in Chapter V especially, how close is 
the relation between familiarity with a word or phrase and the 
act of recognition. Now familiarity, so far at least as our dis- 
cussion is concerned, is synonymous with ability to recognize 
meaning, while the act of recognition is the conditioning factor
-P-A-G-E-155
  ORAL AND SILENT READING 145 
of the duration of the fixation pause. We are at liberty to state, 
therefore, as a result of our previous discussions that the proc- 
ess of silent reading is able to proceed as rapidly as one is able 
to recognize meanings. The characteristic difference from the 
process of oral reading is easy to be seen. The oral-reading 
process can proceed no more rapidly than clear enunciation of 
words and good expression will permit. The demands of utter- 
ance condition oral reading. 
The difference can be stated in another way. The eye- 
movement habits of the silent reader are conditioned by the 
ability of the reader to recognize words and phrases. That is to 
say, when recognition is slow and difficult, fixation pauses are 
many to the line and each is of comparatively long duration; 
when recognition is rapid and easy, fixation pauses are few and 
of short duration. Eye movement in oral reading presents an 
interesting contrast. Here it is that one finds that the eye 
pauses are many to the line and each of considerable duration. 
One finds that the eyes move across the page slightly in ad- 
vance of the voice, often pausing and even moving back until 
the voice catches up. One is led to the conclusion that whereas 
in silent reading eye-movement habits are conditioned by the 
demands of recognition, in oral reading they are conditioned 
by the demands of speech. 
The explanation of this difference is to be sought in the fact that oral 
reading is controlled by speech units rather than divided into units of 
visual perception. The unit of speech is the word. In oral reading the 
eye moves from word to word, directing in this way the vocal apparatus 
as it utters each unit. In silent reading, on the other hand, the unit for 
the trained adult is wholly different ; it is not a unit determined by the 
requirements of speech. It is rather a unit of recognition. If the mind 
can grasp a phrase, that becomes the unit governing fixation. 
The difference in units in the two cases is related also to the differ- 
ence in rate. The vocal apparatus requires more time to make its 
adjustments than does the eye. The slower pace in oral reading is not 
determined, therefore, by the inability of the reader to see and recog- 
nize words rapidly. The silent-reading records show that he can recog-
-P-A-G-E-156
  146 THE TEACHING OF READING 
nize whole phrases rapidly. In oral reading the eye lingers on each 
word, waiting for the vocal apparatus. 
The differences between oral reading and silent reading are impres- 
sively illustrated by contrasting lines 4 and 5 in the two... plates 
[figures]. These lines are made up of short words and phrases; when 
read silently [Fig. 2] they require few fixations. When the same lines 
are read aloud [Fig. 3] the vocal apparatus must sound each word 
separately even though it is a short word; the eyes change their move- 
ments completely, accommodating themselves to the demands of speech. 
The complications and long pauses at the beginning of lines are more 
conspicuous in oral reading than in silent reading, indicating a leisurely 
adjustment throughout. In oral reading the ends of the lines have 
short fixations in fewer cases than in silent reading [Fig. 3, lines 4 
and 5]. This is undoubtedly due to the fact that in most of the lines 
read orally the eyes linger on the end until articulation catches up with 
them. There is no motive, as in silent reading, for the eyes to move 
on as soon as possible. 
Conspicuous cases, in which long pauses are not dictated by the de- 
mands of perception but are due to delay until the vocal apparatus can 
overtake perception, are seen in [Fig. 3] line 1, pause 3; line 2, pauses 2-4; 
line 3, pauses 3 and 6.1 
Shall oral reading be entirely neglected? The foregoing dis- 
cussions serve to impress us with the conclusion that the habits 
developed in oral reading are a positive hindrance to the devel- 
opment of the habits necessary for effective rapid silent read- 
ing. As a consequence we are led to a consideration of the 
question: Shall silent reading take the place of oral reading in 
both lower and upper grades? Shall we follow the example of 
certain teachers and schools in emphasizing silent reading at 
the expense of oral reading in the lower grades? The following 
facts help to provide an answer: 
1. The process of oral reading is more closely related to the 
habits of speech of lower-grade pupils than is the process of 
1C. H. Judd, “Reading: its Nature and Development,” Supplementary 
Educational Monographs of the School Review and the Elementary School 
Journal, Vol. II, No. 4, pp. 21-24. The University of Chicago Press, Chicago,

-P-A-G-E-157
ORAL AND SILENT READING 147 
silent reading. Both types are artificial, manufactured to com- 
ply with the demands of modern society. Oral reading is the 
more natural, because it is the more closely related to the oral 
speech of the child. 
2. Until the fourth grade is reached, generally speaking, the 
pupil’s rate of pronouncing words can exceed his rate of recog- 
nizing words. From the fourth grade on, the pupil’s rate of 
recognizing words not only can exceed his rate of pronouncing 
words but is capable of more rapid development. 
* 3. The period from nine or ten years of age to adolescence is 
quite different from the one which immediately precedes it. 
The child becomes more individual and independent in his 
tastes and desires and habits of study. He becomes more ca- 
pable to strike out for himself in the more or less independent 
task of silent reading. 
Detailed consideration of these facts is now in order. Let 
us direct our attention to a discussion of the first in the list; 
namely, the dependence of reading on oral speech. 
Oral speech is the natural form of communication. In our 
discussion of the kind of reading instruction best adapted to 
pupils in the lower grades we cannot escape consideration of 
the primary facts that spoken language is the natural vehicle 
for the expression of ideas and the one first developed in the 
history of the race, and that written language is the artificial 
one devised to meet the needs of a developing civilization. The 
problem of the school then is one of devising ways and means 
by which the pupil’s acquaintance with the natural vehicle of 
expression may be translated into an acquaintance with the 
artificial one. The pupil’s knowledge and use of spoken lan- 
guage become the means of introduction to a knowledge and 
use of written language; that is, reading. 
The fact that spoken language is the natural form of expres- 
sion can be understood the more clearly if we examine the men- 
tal equipment of pupils at the time they enter the first grade.

-P-A-G-E-158
  148 THE TEACHING OF READING 
By the time a child has reached the age of six he has ac- 
quired a limited command of oral speech. He is able to under- 
stand the speech of others to a limited degree, and he is able to 
express his own thoughts to the extent of being able to take his 
place as a part of the social group of the school. Before this age 
he does not have a command of language sufficient. to enable 
him to understand the simple commands and directions that the 
teacher must give. The whole period of the child’s: training 
previous to his entry into the first grade, both informal in the 
home and formal in the kindergarten, is devoted primarily to 
the task of teaching him to use and to understand oral speech. 
As long as his training is so limited as to fail to include a com- 
mand of the elements of language, the child remains within the 
family ; as soon as his training provides a mastery of the rudi- 
ments of oral speech, the child is permitted to go without the 
family into the confines of the school. 
There are schools which are much embarrassed in their work because 
the pupils do not speak English, and there are individual pupils in the 
first grade who have only a limited command of language because they 
are backward in general mental development. These cases are con: 
spicuous as departures from the general rule that pupils of six years of 
age commonly know enough language to conduct themselves in the social 
group with independence. 
It is at this point that pupils come to school. The school has the 
duty of extending their knowledge of oral language and of introducing 
them to the large body of experiences which will make language the 
vehicle of ideas. It is also the duty of the school to introduce pupils 
to a new type of language; namely, written or printed language. 
Thus we see that for the purpose of our present discussion, 
at least, the statement at the head of this topic is correct. It is 
to be admitted, of course, that children do not acquire a mas- 
tery of oral speech instinctively ; the desire for and interest in 
expression may be instinctive, but the command of language is 
1C, H. Judd, Reading: its Nature and Development, pp. 135-136.
-P-A-G-E-159
  
ORAL AND SILENT READING 149 
the result of a process of training. The point of interest to us, 
however, is that every normal child who enters the first grade 
does have to a greater or less degree a command of oral speech. 
Consequently the kind of training in the first grade which has 
its basis in oral speech may be considered as natural as distin- 
guished from the kind which has its basis apart from oral 
speech. 
“Oral reading is the natural form of primary reading.”* 
The argument that leads to a consideration of oral speech as 
the natural form of communication leads also to the considera- 
tion that oral reading is the natural form of primary reading. 
Oral language is familiar to the pupil when he begins to read. 
He is acquainted with a few well-established forms of oral 
expression, He talks and he can understand. His thinking 
takes form in oral expression. The process of thinking with- 
out an immediate oral expression of his thoughts is foreign to 
his experience. The ability to think silently, to consider the 
thoughts of others silently, to read silently, is the result of train- 
ing. The training begins in the ability of pupils to take part in 
the activity of oral expression. 
Professor Judd states the matter from a slightly different 
point of view: 
Furthermore, spoken language, by its historical and structural rela- 
tions to written language, naturally dominates reading. Printed words 
are not related directly to things, but to the sounds which make up the 
names of things. In other words, letters are symbols of sounds, not 
pictures of objects. We may put pictures into reading books to illus- 
trate the story, but the child cannot make a direct jump from the 
picture to the printed word; he must go by way of sounds. Going by 
way of sounds is more natural because when he comes to the reading 
class the child brings a fully developed mastery of many sound words 
and their meanings. 
It may be concluded, therefore, as the first dominant principle in the 
teaching of reading in the primary grades that all printed and written 
words are naturally associated with sounds; that is, with oral language.?

  150 THE TEACHING OF READING 
Oral reading provides a means of testing. The importance 
of devoting considerable emphasis to oral reading in the pri- 
mary grades may be considered from the standpoint of the ab- 
solute necessity for the teacher to have a constant check on the 
strong points and weaknesses of each pupil’s ability. Oral read- 
ing on the part of primary pupils provides a means for such a 
check. 
We now arrive at the second point in our list bearing on the 
importance of oral reading in the lower grades; namely, the 
general relation between the ability of pupils to pronounce 
words and their ability to recognize words. 
Recognition is rapid in development; pronunciation is slow. 
The general relation between the ability of pupils to pronounce 
words and their ability to recognize words is presented in 
Fig. 16. 
The full-drawn line in [Fig. 16] represents the facts with regard to 
the rate of articulation in the grades. In the same figure the broken 
line represents the development in the power of recognizing words. 
. This line must of necessity begin below the line for articulation. In 
many cases recognition is at absolute zero at the time the pupils come 
to the first grade. In the seventh grade the power of recognizing words 
is higher than the power of articulation. . .. The evidence on this 
matter is most directly secured by studying the rate of silent reading 
where only recognition is involved. Oberholtzer gives the rate of silent 
reading in the seventh grades of Tulsa, Oklahoma, as from 210 to 275 
words per minute and sets down as a standard for that grade 250 words 
per minute. How far above the line for articulation the line for recogni- 
tion might go is difficult to decide because there is an artificial influence 
which distorts the situation. This artificial influence is the insistence of 
the schools on oral reading as the chief type of reading in the upper 
grades. This insistence tends to keep all children down in their silent 
reading to the rate set by the oral reading emphasized in the schools. 
A study of [Fig. 16] makes it clear that the relation between ar- 
ticulation and recognition is not the same in the upper grades as it is in 
the lower grades. When the pupil reads aloud in the lower grades, he uses 
a form of expression which is far more fully developed than his power 
of recognition of words. In the upper grades exactly the reverse is
-P-A-G-E-161

true. When the teacher calls on an upper-grade pupil to read orally 
that pupil must go more slowly than he would if he were reading to 
himself.t 
A careful study of Fig. 16 points the way to one general 
conclusion, even though the evidence is by no means complete:

silent reading, the conclusion is: oral reading in the lower 
grades tends to build up the capacity of pupils to read silently ; 
in the upper grades oral reading is a positive hindrance to the 
development of good silent-reading habits. 
Let us proceed now to a consideration of our third point— 
that the child at the age of nine or ten years enters a period of 
development different in character from the one which precedes it. 
Socal imitation characterizes the former period. In a preced- 
ing chapter (Chapter III) we have had pointed out as one of 
the reasons why the age of six is the crucial age in which to be- 
gin the teaching of reading the fact that primary pupils are 
socially imitative. Children take delight in copying the actions 
and manners of speech, the accomplishments and performances, 
of their elders. What everybody does the child wishes to be 
known as doing. It being the fashion (or a part of the fashion) 
for the adult to peruse the newspaper, books, and magazines, 
and to write upon paper, the child is willing, even anxious, to 
advertise himself as having the ability to carry on the same 
performances. Though his product be of the crudest possible 
sort, the child of the primary grades is willing to read, to write, 
to cipher, to construct, and to play at all these activities so long 
as he finds himself to be under the approving eye of his elders. 
His desire for social approval, his tendency to imitate, and his 
docility are the most noticeable characteristics of the child of 
six to eight or nine years. 
The age of nine is a turning point. In the primary grades the 
normal child has been content to be a social imitator. His in- 
terest has been centered primarily in performing, and in pre- 
tending to perform, the same activities in which his elders are 
engaged. His interest has never been centered primarily on the 
character of his product. He may be said to be entirely un- 
conscious of how exceedingly crude his productions are. The 
normal child goes through the whole of the primary-school 
period without manifesting any attitude of criticism of the 
work that he does.
-P-A-G-E-163
  
ORAL AND SILENT READING 153 
Gradually there comes a change. The child continues to read 
until his attention becomes centered on his product; that is, 
the result of his performance rather than the performance it- 
self. In handwriting the mere act of writing no longer satisfies. 
The child begins to notice how ineffective his efforts are and 
what crude results he is able to produce. For the first time he 
compares in a critical way the results of his efforts at reading, 
writing, drawing, arithmetic, etc. with like results of his fellows 
in school and with those of his elders. Any such comparison is 
distinctly unfavorable when considered from the standpoint 
of the child, who is now learning to make the comparison. He 
becomes all the more critical of his own efforts; his interest 
becomes centered in himself rather than in social approval; 
he becomes self-conscious; in short, the normal child at the 
age of nine ceases to comply in a spirit of willingness and satis- 
faction with the demands the school has up to this time been 
making upon him. His interest in himself as an individual 
reveals to him the fact that he is now an independent master 
of reading, writing, and language. Henceforth his desire is to use 
these subjects for his own private purposes. The child ceases to 
be a social imitator. He now has become an individualist. 
The results of the change are easily observable among pupils 
of the intermediate grades. Here, for the first time in the school 
period, the problem of discipline becomes a serious one. The 
intermediate pupil is disregardful of the rights of others. He 
refuses to follow the dictates of the teacher. Whenever possible 
he asserts his independence in social matters. In his studies he 
turns away from the directions of the teacher in his effort to 
assert himself as an individual. In writing, the copybook is 
neglected, and the child turns to the task of composing a note 
to a friend in a rapid, scrawling hand. In drawing he forsakes 
his models and book of instructions, and in their stead produces 
a caricature which he labels “teacher.” His mother tongue he 
neglects for a mysterious language of his own invention,—Jay

  154 THE TEACHING OF READING 
not want to go to school,’—the “hog Latin” of the preadoles- 
cent boy. The child’s attitude toward reading is described in 
the following account of the experiences of a young and some- 
what inexperienced elementary-school principal: 
During my first year as principal of the school I noted the fact that 
the instruction in reading in the primary grades appeared to be exceed- 
ingly well done. The pupils read with expression, and their mastery of 
the mechanics appeared to be as great as one might hope to secure in 
pupils of their age. In the fourth grade, appearances were quite different. 
Fully a third of the pupils read haltingly and without expression. Words 
were mispronounced and omitted; sometimes even whole lines were 
skipped. The work in this grade was considered exceedingly poor. At 
the end of the year, however, these pupils were promoted ‘‘on trial,” not 
because they were deemed worthy of promotion but in order to make 
room for the incoming third grade. During the succeeding year and 
the years that followed not one of these “trial promotions” failed to 
complete the work of his grade, some of them standing far ahead of the 
average of their class. 
During my second year I expected to find the work in reading in the 
fourth grade very much improved because of the exceptionally good 
records of the pupils who had been promoted from the third grade. 
Much to my surprise the work in oral reading this year was just as 
lacking in all qualities of excellence as the work I had witnessed the 
first year. 
Our discussion has proceeded far enough to disclose the fact 
that the age of nine is a turning point in the life of the child. 
The fact is impressed upon us that the pupils of the inter- 
mediate grades are not the same children they were in the 
primary grades. Their tastes differ ; their desires have changed ; 
their attitudes of mind and habits of work can hardly be rec- 
ognized as belonging to the same children we knew a year or 
two previously. 
The change demands a different mode of instruction. What 
is the significance of the change at the age of nine from a period 
of social imitation to a period of individualism? From the 
standpoint of the school the significance is that the methods of
-P-A-G-E-165
  ORAL AND SILENT READING 155 
instruction which are suitable to children in the primary grades 
are not productive of results when used with children in the 
intermediate grades. The meaning is that our methods of 
teaching reading in the intermediate grades need to be care-, 
fully revised. The child no longer is satisfied—indeed, he often 
is quite emphatic in his refusal—to continue the slow and tedi- 
ous and very formal drills in oral reading. Attending to form 
and expression for the sake of the teacher’s commendation no 
longer is a chief interest with him. His interest in reading 
now becomes an individual one. His interest is in content; he 
wants to secure meaning in the quickest way possible. His ap- 
parent inferiority in oral reading, such as was referred to in the 
above quotation, is in reality an indication of progress. His 
apparent inferiority is due to the fact that in his effort to secure 
meaning he is willing to slight the pronunciation of words and 
phrases. His ability to recognize words is now greater than his 
ability to articulate. His eyes now run along the words and 
phrases so rapidly that his vocal apparatus is hopelessly left 
behind. It is clear that now is the time when the school should 
shift the emphasis from instruction in oral reading to instruc- 
tion in silent reading. Reading for meaning now can be empha- 
sized without difficulty because that is the only kind of reading 
which has an appeal to children of the intermediate grades. 
Conclusions. We are now in a position to answer with some 
degree of assurance the question raised in our minds through the 
reading ofthe first part of the present chapter ; namely, (1) Shall 
oral reading be entirely neglected? (2) What is the relation 
of instruction in oral reading to instruction in silent read- 
ing? (3) When shall the school begin to shift the emphasis from 
oral to silent reading? Our answers are as follows: 
1. Oral reading is the natural form of primary reading. 
2. Oral reading in the primary grades contributes to the 
development of the pupil’s power in the recognition of words; 
in the upper grades oral reading tends to retard such develop- 
ment. 
 
-P-A-G-E-166
  156 THE TEACHING OF READING 
3. The beginning of the intermediate grades is the point 
where the shift in emphasis from oral to silent reading needs 
to be made. Fig. 16 makes it clear that at this point the 
rate of recognizing words begins to exceed the rate of pro- 
nouncing words. Our recent discussion has emphasized the 
fact that at the age of nine the normal child is at the begin- 
ning of a period of development radically different from the 
preceding period. 
It should be noted that the foregoing conclusions insist upon 
a shift in emphasis from oral to silent reading, not upon a 
radical change from oral-reading instruction to silent-reading 
instruction. The conclusions only state that oral reading shall 
receive the emphasis before the fourth grade and silent reading 
after the fourth grade. Later discussions will make clear that 
silent-reading instruction has a place in the work of the pri- 
mary grades (Chapters XI-XIII) and that oral-reading in- 
struction has a place in the work of the intermediate grades 
(Chapter XIV). 
It should be noted also that the point where the shift in 
emphasis should be made may vary with different schools and 
with different modes of instruction. Let us return to an exam- 
ination of Fig. 16 and assume that in a given school the quality 
of instruction in recognizing the meanings of words and in 
silent reading for meaning is much better than the ordinary, and 
that as a consequence the rate of recognizing words is higher 
in every grade than is represented by the broken line. It can 
be seen that the line that would represent rate of recognizing 
words for such a school would cut the line which represents 
rate of articulation before the fourth grade is reached, and thus 
would indicate the necessity for a shift in emphasis from oral 
to silent reading before the fourth grade. Thus in every school 
where the quality of the instruction in reading for meaning is 
improved we may expect that the pupils will be prepared to 
devote the larger portion of their time to silent reading earlier 
than will the pupils in the average school. é
-P-A-G-E-167
ORAL AND SILENT READING 157 
The school should teach silent reading. Notwithstanding the 
fact that the importance of training pupils to read so that they 
will be able to secure meaning rapidly is almost universally rec- 
ognized, the schools persist in the attempt to emphasize oral 
reading to the neglect of silent Yeading. The reason may be 
attributed, at least in part, to superiority in methods of instruc- 
tion in the former type of reading over methods in the latter 
type. The lack of systematic methods of instruction in effec- 
tive rapid silent reading is one of the most unfortunate short- 
comings of our schools. For centuries pupils have been taught 
to read orally, because oral reading best met the needs of a 
former day, and as a consequence oral-reading methods have 
been carefully worked out and systematized. The situation 
with respect to silent reading has been exactly the reverse. In 
former times the demands for training in silent reading were 
very few; the schools paid little if any attention to instruction 
in silent reading. Whatever ability pupils were able to secure 
in silent reading they secured incidentally and largely by acci- 
dent. As a consequence very few teachers have ever paid the 
slightest attention to the task of devising ways and means of 
teaching silent reading. The reason is clear why oral reading 
continues to receive the emphasis to the neglect of silent read- 
ing. Teachers as a rule choose to make use of systematic and 
well-organized methods and devices of instruction in preference 
to those which are unsystematic and poorly organized. 
That the schools should teach silent reading we hardly need 
to repeat here. The burden of the discussion of this book bears 
on this point. Whatever demands of repetition that may yet 
exist may be met by a restatement of the necessity of a change 
in emphasis in reading instruction at the beginning of the in- 
termediate grades. The following paragraphs are pertinent to 
this point, and at the same time they provide for us an excellent 
summary statement : 
Why have the schools failed to recognize these facts? The answer 
is doubtless twofold. First, there is a natural tendency to continue
-P-A-G-E-168
  158 THE TEACHING OF READING 
methods which have proved successful in the lower grades even after 
the original justification for such methods has disappeared. Secondly, 
there are enough poor readers in every school to cover up the evil 
effects of slow methods in the upper grades. The conscientious teacher 
supplied with a reading book and a period in the program carries on 
with painful punctiliousness the well-known reading farce in the vain 
hope that the effects of unsuccessful teaching will be overcome by a 
liberal application of the same methods that produced the difficulty. 
Teachers ought to recognize with clearness the fact that in the upper 
grades silent reading is the really useful type of reading. They ought to 
understand that pupils outgrow oral reading just as infants outgrow 
creeping when they learn to stand up and walk. 
Even where the reader is deficient but has arrived in the. upper 
grades there are methods other than those of phonic analysis and oral 
drill which will help him to master his difficulties. [There are methods 
of word analysis] which avoid the mistake of merely repeating in the 
upper grades the primary methods which are no longer appropriate. 
Many schools have not recognized the demand for a new type of 
instruction in reading from the fourth grade on and as a result have 
seriously hindered the development of pupils. At this period the power 
of recognizing printed words has developed to the point where the 
pupil tends to throw off the limiting influences of oral language. In 
practical experience this is exhibited by the fact that the fourth-grade 
child reads with interest and avidity. Sometimes his eyes run along the 
line so rapidly that his vocal apparatus is hopelessly left behind. Fourth- 
grade teachers sometimes call attention to the fact that pupils who 
were very good oral readers in the third grade begin to stumble in the 
fourth grade. This stumbling is due to the failure of articulation to 
keep up with recognition. 
It is at this point that a very radical change in attitude ought to be 
assumed by the school. Even before this stumbling begins the school 
ought to see the propriety of giving training in silent reading. In the 
fourth grade the pupil should be encouraged to make this the chief form 
of his reading. Later, if it is deemed wise, the school may come back 
to training in oral reading for the sake of appreciation and public exhi- 
bition. It is a mistake to jeopardize the child’s independent, fluent 
silent reading in the fourth grade by insisting during this period on the 
usual oral exercises.*

Summary. The purpose of the present chapter has been 16 | 
point out the relationship between instruction in oral reading 
and instruction in silent reading. The characteristic differences 
between these two types of reading were first considered. Our 
examination of the two processes led to the conclusion that 
training in the former type does not guarantee progress in 
the latter. Considering next the three important points of the 
chapter—namely, (1) that oral reading is the natural form of 
primary reading, (2) that the fourth grade marks the point 
where the power to recognize words begins to exceed the power 
to pronounce words, and (3) that the age of nine is a turning 
point in the life of the child—we reached the conclusion that 
the schools should emphasize oral reading in the primary 
grades and silent reading in the intermediate grades.

READING 
CHAPTER X 
THE DEVELOPMENT OF MODERN METHODS IN READING 
The history of reading and of reading methods is a chapter in 
the history of civilization. So long as man was unable to learn 
of and from the experience of others, civilization was static— 
it did not progress. As soon as it became possible for man to 
participate vicariously in the experience of others, civilization 
began to move forward in ever-lengthening strides. It is im- 
possible to conceive of our present civilization—indeed, of any 
former and ancient civilization—as being the result of the work 
and learning and experience of one generation. It is rather the 
result of the experience of the present generation combined 
with and superimposed upon the experience of every generation 
which has preceded. When, as in prehistoric days, the indi- 
vidual trod the pathway of life guided wholly by his own ex- 
perience, he attained the stature of manhood and declined into 
old age, having reached no higher levels of intellectual and 
moral development than those reached by his fathers. When, 
as in the present day, the individual has opened before him the 
combined experiences of all the ages, and has given to him the 
opportunity of participating vicariously therein and of learning 
thereby, he is permitted to progress into a civilized state not 
merely as far as his fathers before him have gone but, by add- 
ing thereto the results of his own experience, to go one step 
farther. Carried on the vehicle of his own imagination one is

today permitted to enter by way of the gateway of reading into 
the experiences not only of all that is present but also of all 
that is past. The history of civilization is indeed the history 
of the development of the language arts. 
The purpose of the present chapter defined. It would be of 
interest, and perhaps highly instructive, if we were to trace the 
development of the reading art from the day when prehistoric 
man scratched on stone a crude pictograph of his prowess in the 
chase or as a warrior. But that would be going too far afield 
from the more practical purposes of this book. It is important 
for us here to select from the history of reading and of reading 
methods only those phases which have a bearing on our central 
theme; namely, principles and methods. The present chapter 
is one of transition from a discussion of general principles and 
of our present-day conception of the reading process to a dis- 
cussion of specific problems and methods of the classroom. 
The aim to be chosen is unmistakable. Our theme, accordingly, 
shall be to point out the intimate relationship which has al- 
ways existed between the methods of teaching reading and the 
conceptions people have had of the nature of the reading 
process. 
The early conception made no distinction between writing 
and reading. The art of writing had its inception in the effort 
of prehistoric man to communicate with his fellows by means 
of written symbols. The symbols first used were crude pictures 
which represented the objects which were most prominent and 
most significant in the deeds and ideas to be communicated. 
Gradually the pictures used became conventionalized to the 
extent that a given picture or group of pictures always con- 
veyed the same meaning. Later this crude portraiture was 
modified so that an idea could be expressed by means of a single 
symbol. Picture-writing in its final stage of development con- 
sisted in the combination of pictographs and ideographs, the 
former representing objects by conventionalized picture signs, 
the latter representing ideas by conventionalized idea signs.  
-P-A-G-E-172
  162 THE TEACHING OF READING 
A thorough understanding of the meaning of the convention- 
alized symbols was necessary in order to be able to write. 
Reading demanded the same thorough understanding. In this 
respect there was no difference between the two processes. In 
either case the proper relation between symbol and idea had 
to be made. Writing consisted in choosing the proper symbols 
to express the idea; reading consisted in determining what 
idea fitted the symbols which were being translated. Reading 
was thus the opposite of writing. Ability in the one art pre- 
supposed a corresponding ability in the other. Whatever in- 
struction, therefore, was given to the youth of an ancient day in 
picture-writing served just as well and was just as useful to him 
as instruction in reading. Thus we see that from the very dawn 
of civilization the idea that writing and reading were kindred 
arts fastened itself upon the race. i 
The influence of the invention of an alphabet. Gradually the 
art of representing ideas by conventionalized symbols was de- 
veloped to the point where it was recognized that symbols could 
be selected and agreed upon to stand for sounds as well as for 
ideas. It came about through the practice which had grown up 
of using the same sign to represent two words of like sound but 
having different meanings. Thus, the symbol for sun could just 
as well be used to represent son. 
By degrees, also, it was discovered that the different words 
of the language were expressed by various combinations of a 
few elementary sounds. The two discoveries, put together, con- 
stituted a momentous triumph in the efforts of men to perfect a 
written language. Instead of being compelled to familiarize 
himself with thousands of symbols, each representing a differ- 
ent idea or word, and to tax his imagination to the limit to in- 
vent a new symbol for each new word, the writer now was able 
to represent any word in his language by first analyzing the 
word into its constituent sounds and then representing each 
sound by the use of the proper symbol chosen from a list of 
twenty-six. “Could the prephonetic scribe of Egypt have had a
-P-A-G-E-173
MODERN METHODS IN READING 163 
vision of such a system and its possibilities, he would have 
deemed it the miracle of miracles. His thousands of characters 
and his fertility of resource in their use were taxed to their 
utmost to produce results that were far inferior to the work of 
these simple letter-forms.”’ 
The significance of the invention of an alphabet, so far as 
we are concerned here, is that it marked an advanced stage in 
the art of writing, and that its very importance to the writing 
art tended to implant in the mind of the race a conception of 
reading that has proved to be a means of stagnation rather than 
of development to the latter art. 
Word analysis was demanded by writing. We have seen how 
the invention of an alphabet came about in part by the discov- 
ery that a word was made up of a combination of certain ele- 
mentary sounds. To be able to represent the elementary sounds 
by the correct symbols arranged in proper order constituted 
all that was necessary in order to be able to write. The ability 
to analyze words into their sound elements was the criterion. 
He who had this ability became the scribe, and thus to qualify 
became a badge of distinction. The scrivener occupied a place 
in society set apart from the common herd; he was the posses- 
sor of a peculiar ability which for a long time was looked upon 
by the ordinary man with awe and reverence. 
Not only was there an undue amount of importance ascribed 
to word analysis by those who did not possess the ability, but 
even those who were adepts in the art of writing considered the 
ability to analyze words into their constituent sounds as the all- 
important function of their art. The very importance of the 
invention of an alphabet and the superiority of its use over 
other systems of writing tended to emphasize and hold attention 
upon the means by which it was discovered. The invention 
came about by word analysis; word analysis was considered, 
therefore, as the ability of supreme importance.

  164 THE TEACHING OF READING 
Word-building was considered the requirement for reading. 
The old conception that reading was a process just the opposite 
of writing continued to wield its influence after the invention 
of an alphabet. The conception continued to prevail that the 
reader must traverse the same road as the writer but in an 
opposite direction. The ability to record ideas, to inscribe 
them in permanent form, to write, was held as the ability of 
primary importance. Quite naturally any instruction that may 
have been given in reading had its source in the prevailing con- 
ception of writing. Now it was that writing meant the break- 
ing up of words into their A B C’s; reading, being the opposite 
process, meant the reassembling into words of the A B C’s that 
had been wiitten down. Writing meant the dividing of words 
into letters and inscribing the letters on paper; reading meant 
the sensing of the letters as they appeared on the page and 
building them into the proper words. 
" We have seen in a previous chapter (Chapter V) how the 
psychologists of more recent times worked out the underlying 
principle of the alphabet method. With reference to the very 
plausible discussions of Pestalozzi of his “from simple to com- 
plex” theory of method we need have no concern here. It is 
enough for us to note that Pestalozzi added nothing new to the 
prevailing conception of the process; that his theories had their 
basis in the time-worn conception that reading consisted in 
building words out of their essential elements. 
It is difficult for us in this later day to conceive of the read- 
ing process in other than the modern sense. However, unless 
we do examine into the former conception of reading and com- 
prehend how firmly implanted it came to be in the mind of the 
race, we will be unable to understand how it came about that 
such a wasteful method of teaching reading as the alphabet 
method was looked upon by teachers for so long a time with 
such blind devotion. 
The influence of the former conception on methods. From 
the earliest times of which the history of reading gives us a
-P-A-G-E-175
    MODERN METHODS IN READING 165 
record down to the middle of the nineteenth century the word- 
building conception of the reading process has ruled over school 
methods with almost undisputed sway. The A B C method was 
general among the Greeks and Romans. It was the method of 
the cloister schools, and the new impetus given to the study of 
reading by the Reformation produced in it no material change. 
It characterized the teaching in the schools of the colonies, and 
even today its effects are still to be observed in not a few of 
our backward schools. 
From time to time the alphabet method has been variously 
modified, but with each modification no change in principle 
has resulted. One writer (Quintilian, a.p. 68) advised the use 
of blocks and tablets containing the letters to be learned; an- 
other (Basedow, 1723-1790) recommended the “gingerbread 
method,” which has been described as follows: 
To Master John the English maid 
A horn book gives of gingerbread, 
And that the child may learn the better, 
As he can name he eats the letter. 
Proceeding thus with vast delight 
He spells and gnaws from left to right. 
Every school was to be supplied with a bakeshop for the pur- 
pose of keeping the children of the reading classes well supplied 
with letters of gingerbread. The “New England Primer,” 1690, 
sought to encourage the learning of the letters by means of 
rimes; for example: 
A In Adam’s fall 
We sinned all. 
Z_ Zaccheus he 
Did climb the Tree 
Our Lord to see.

  166 THE TEACHING OF READING 
A century later Webster’s “Spelling Book,” 1783, undertook to 
assist the development of the reading process by emphasizing 
the spelling of long lists of words, combining in one volume the 
alphabet, speller, primer, and reader. Innovations came and 
went, each doing no more than to clothe the old-established 
method in a garment which was new. 
The A B C method continued in our schools so long as the 
prevailing conception of the process gave it sanction. As soon 
as a new conception arose in the minds of the people generally, 
a new method was developed to take the place of the old. Let 
us turn our attention to the manner by which modern methods 
of teaching reading have developed. 
The development of modern methods of teaching reading 
has come as a result of two conditions; namely, (1) dissatisfac- 
tion with the very inadequate results of the A B C method, and 
(2) the development of a new conception of the reading process. 
The A B C method produced meager results. Learning to 
read by the A B C method consumed an enormous amount of 
time. After years of school instruction, with daily drills in the 
letters and in putting them together into syllables and into 
words, children learned to read only in a fashion which was 
mechanical in the extreme. If we are to believe the critics of 
the wasteful methods of a former day, we cannot but see that 
the ability to get meaning was hardly considered in the aims 
and outcomes of instruction. Horace Mann, in his second an- 
nual report to the Board of Education of Massachusetts in 
1838, writes as follows: 
Entertaining views of the importance of this subject, of which the 
above is only the feeblest expression, I have devoted especial pains to 
learn, with some degree of numerical accuracy, how far the reading, in 
our schools, is an exercise of the mind in thinking and feeling, and 
how far it is a barren action of the organs of speech upon the atmos- 
phere. My information is derived, principally, from the written state- 
ments of the school committees of the respective towns,—gentlemen 
who are certainly exempt from all temptation to disparage the schools 
they superintend. The result is, that more than eleven-twelfths of all
-P-A-G-E-177
  
MODERN METHODS IN READING 167 
the children in the reading-classes, in our schools, do not understand the 
meaning of the words they read; that they do not master the sense of 
the reading-lessons, and that the ideas and feelings intended by the 
author to be conveyed to, and excited in, the reader’s mind, still rest 
in the author’s intention, never having yet reached the place of their 
destination. And by this it is not meant that the scholars do not obtain 
such a full comprehension of the subject of the reading-lessons, in its 
various relations and bearings, as a scientific or erudite reader would 
do, but that they do not acquire a reasonable and practicable under- 
standing of them. It would hardly seem that the combined efforts of 
all persons engaged could have accomplished more in defeating the 
true objects of reading. 
How the cause of this deficiency is to be apportioned among the 
legal supervisors of the schools, parents, teachers or authors of school- 
books, it is impossible to say ; but surely it is an evil, gratuitous, widely 
prevalent, and threatening the most alarming consequences. But it is 
not a remediless one. There is intelligence enough in this community 
to search out the cause, and wisdom enough to find and apply a remedy.t 
The alphabet method is blamed for the very inadequate re- 
sults in reading. We read: 4 
. . . The general practice is founded upon the notion that the learn- 
ing of letters facilitates the correct combination of them into words. 
Hence children are drilled on the alphabet until they pronounce the 
name of each letter at sight. And yet, when we combine letters into 
words, we forthwith discard the sounds which belonged to them as 
letters. The child is taught to sound the letter a, until he becomes so 
familiar with it, that the sound is uttered as soon as the character is 
seen. But the first time this letter is found, even in the most familiar 
words, as in father, papa, mamma, apple, peach, walnut, hat, cap, bat, 
rat, slap, pan, &c., &c.,—it no longer has the sound he was taught to 
give it, but one entirely different. And so of the other vowels. In 
words, they all seem in masquerade. Where is the alphabetic sound of 
“o in the words word, dove, plough, enough, other, and in innumerable 
others? Any person may verify this by taking any succession of words, 
at random, in any English book. The consequence is, that whenever the

child meets his old friends in new company, like rogues, they have all 
changed their names. Thus the knowledge of the sounds of letters in 
the alphabet becomes an obstacle to the right pronunciation of words; 
and the more perfect the knowledge, the greater the obstacle. The 
reward of the child, for having thoroughly mastered his letters, is to 
have his knowledge of them cut up in detail, by a regular series of con- 
tradictions, just as fast as he brings it forward. How different, for in- 
stance, is the sound of the word is, from the two alphabetic sounds, i 
and s;—of the word we, from the two sounds, w and e ;—of the word 
two, from the three sounds, ¢, w, and 0. We teach an honest child to 
sound the letters, e, y, e, singly, until he utters them at sight, and then, 
with a grave face, we ask him what e, y, e, spells; and if he does not 
give the long sound of i, he is lucky if he escapes a rebuke or a frown. 
Nothing can more clearly prove the delightful confidence and trustful- 
ness of a child’s nature, than his not boldly charging us, under such 
circumstances, with imposition and fraud.t 
The influence of the prevailing conception of the reading 
process was not overlooked by Mr. Mann. Failure to under- 
stand the “true objects of reading” was mentioned as a con- 
tributing cause of unintelligent reading: 
. . . Another cause consists in a most pernicious error on the part 
of parents in regard to the true objects of reading. Many teachers have 
assured me that they are perfectly aware that the time spent in reading 
is mainly lost; but that the usages of the school and the demands of 
the district prohibit them—perhaps under penalty of dismission— from 
adopting a better mode. It is said, that the first and only inquiry made 
by parents of their children is, “Show many times and how much have 
you read ?” not “what have you read about?” A question like the last 
presupposes some judgment and some ability to follow it up with 
further inquiries ; but anybody can put the first, for it is an easy prob- 
lem which solves the ratio of mental progress by the number of pages 
mechanically gone over. The children’s minds are not looked into, to, 
see what new operations they can accurately perform; but the inquiry 
relates only to the amount of labor done by the organs of speech ; —as 
though so many turns of the bodily machine would yield, perforce, a

corresponding amount of mental product. It is characteristic of the 
learned professions, that the person employed directs the employer; 
and it is earnestly to be hoped, that teachers will soon deservedly win 
so much of the confidence of the community, that they will no longer 
feel constrained to practice methods they know to be valueless, in order 
to harmonize with opinions they know to be pernicious. 
The new conception of reading developed gradually. Teach- 
ing reading by a method different from the alphabet method 
was suggested by Comenius in the “Orbis Pictus” as early as 
1657. In his preface Comenius says: 
The very looking upon the thing pictured suggesting the name of the 
thing will tell the child how the title of the picture is to be read. And 
thus the whole book being gone over by the bare titles of the pictures, 
reading cannot but be learned—and indeed, too, without using any 
ordinary tedious spelling—that most troublesome torture of wits.2 
Other advocates of a method which was different are referred 
to briefly by Huey as follows: 
There were glimpses of better things in the phonetic system of the 
Jansenists, and in the primer of Gedike, in 1791, which advised teach- 
ing words before letters, as the natural order is from the whole to the 
parts; but none of these had appreciable effect in changing current 
ABC practice until Jacotot (1770-1840) advocated the word-method 
as a part of his system, and set forth clearly the arguments for it. 
In America, Worcester’s Primer, in 1828, seems to have been the 
first beginners’ book to recognize any other than the alphabet method. 
The author says in his preface: “It is not, perhaps, very important that 
a child should know the letters before it begins to read. It may learn 
first to read words by seeing them, hearing them pronounced, and having 
their meanings illustrated; and afterward it may learn to analyze them 
or name the letters of which they are composed.” Bumstead, in the 
first book of his series of readers, published in 1840-1843, stood stoutly 
for the word-method, and urged that a scholar be never required to 
spell a word “before he has so far learned it as to be able to read it.”

170 THE TEACHING OF READING 
A final quotation from Horace Mann’s second report will 
serve to show how great a reform in theory had been accom- 
plished by the end of the first half of the nineteenth century: 
During the first year of a child’s life, he perceives, thinks, and ac- 
quires something of a store of ideas, without any reference to word or 
letters. After this, the wonderful faculty of language begins to develop 
itself. Children then utter words,—the names of objects around them, 
—as whole sounds, and without any conception of the letters of which 
those words are composed. In speaking the word “apple,” for instance, 
young children think no more of the Roman letters which spell it, than, 
in eating the fruit, they think of the chemical ingredients—the oxygen, 
hydrogen, and carbon—which compose it. Hence, presenting them 
with the alphabet, is giving them what they never saw, heard, or 
thought of before. It is as new as algebra, and, to the eye, not very 
unlike it. But printed names of known things are the signs of sounds 
which their ears have been accustomed to hear, and their organs of 
speech to utter, and which may excite agreeable feelings and associa- 
tions, by reminding them of the objects named. When put to learning 
the letters of the alphabet first, the child has no acquaintance with 
them, either with the eye, the ear, the tongue, or the mind; but if put 
to learning familiar words first, he already knows them by the ear, the 
tongue, and the mind, while his eye only is unacquainted with them. 
He is thus introduced to a stranger through the medium of old ac- 
quaintances. It can hardly be doubted, therefore, that a child would 
learn to name any twenty-six familiar words much sooner than the 
twenty-six unknown, unheard, and unthought-of letters of the alphabet. 
Since the days of Horace Mann not a few modifications have 
been made in the prevailing conception of the underlying prin- 
ciples which should govern the teaching of reading. The first of 
these modifications followed close upon the realization that a 
strictly word method was inadequate if the child is to arrive at 
an independent mastery of the words he meets in his reading. 
Other modifications relate themselves to the necessity of being 
able to recognize in meaningful phrase-units and sentence-

units, to the importance of instruction in silent reading, and to 
the demand for content in the reading material. 
Let us consider each in turn. We may do this by examining 
the various systems of school readers which have been published 
in recent years. These offer a very fruitful field for the study 
of reading methods and of the principles which underlie them. 
One reason is that methods of teaching reading in our schools 
are determined in large measure by the systems of readers in 
use. Another reason is that a system of readers is usually ac- 
companied by a teachers’ manual which outlines the particular 
method to be employed and states the principle which should 
govern each step of the process. 
The word method proved to be incomplete. In Chapter VI 
we have noted the reasons why the word method by itself does 
not lead to an independent mastery of words. These reasons 
very quickly impressed themselves on the minds of those who 
first substituted the word method for the A B C method. It was 
found that the word method was an excellent substitute so long 
as the child was learning the printed forms of short, familiar 
words, but that it fell short of being adequate for the teaching 
of words which were long and relatively unfamiliar. The fol- 
lowing quotations describe the method of phonic analysis which 
was devised to supplement the strictly word method: 
The difficulty the child experiences in determining a new word, is, 
in general, directly proportional to the number of parts he has to recog- 
nize in it. By the use, then, of compound phonograms, which, being 
taught as wholes, are no harder to recognize than simple ones, hundreds 
of long and hard words are practically transformed into short and easy 
ones. Thus, the word lightning, which the child learning by this method 
reads, light n ing, he finds no more difficult than the short word /eft, in 
which also he has to recognize and put together four separate sounds.1 
A system of phonetics is developed as a means of word-getting. 
This begins in the fourth week with oral ear-training exercises, develop- 
ing in the eighth week into the analysis of simple two-letter and three-

172 THE TEACHING OF READING 
letter words, each containing a short vowel. The method is analytic, 
taking words that are familiar to the child, analyzing them into their 
elements, and recombining the elements into new words. The initial ~ 
blend is used as the foundation of word-building, for the reason that 
in pronouncing a word we naturally and inevitably join the initial conso- 
nant with the vowel which follows it, and if we pause it is between the 
vowel and the succeeding consonant. This is the natural division.t 
The method of teaching phonetics by the use of the initial blend, or 
natural blend, has been fully and successfully developed by Superin- 
tendent James H. Fassett in the Beacon Readers (Ginn and Company). 
The method set forth in this Manual, however, differs from Mr. Fas- 
sett’s in that it first analyzes known words into their phonetic elements 
and then recombines these elements into new words, while the Beacon 
system begins with a study of the phonetic elements. The Beacon 
system is synthetic ; that is, it builds up words by putting together the 
elementary sounds. The present system is analytic; that is, it first 
analyzes or takes apart known words in order to discover the phonetic 
elements, and afterwards builds new words from the elements so 
obtained.” 
Sentences, not words, are the units of thought. It has come 
to be recognized that a child can become proficient in the 
recognition of words and yet not develop into a good reader, 
because he may read a word at a time, neglecting the while to 
put the words together into meaningful phrases and sentences. 
Thus we have the justification in part of the sentence method 
which was worked out by Farnham in 1870 and which was 
widely adopted between 1885 and 1890. The principles which 
govern the method are stated by Huey as follows: 
. . . The method urges that the sentence, and not the word or letter, 
is the true unit in language, expressing whole thoughts which are the 
units in thinking. If the sentence is the natural unit in language, it is 
the natural unit in reading as in speaking. As the word is not a mere 
sum of letter-sounds and letter-names, neither is the sentence merely

MODERN METHODS IN READING 173 
a sequence of word-sounds and word-names. It has a distinctive total 
sound and appearance and meaning indicated plainly in the way it is 
spoken when its meaning is felt. It is read and spoken naturally only 
when this total meaning is prominent in the consciousness of the reader 
or the speaker. Hence the attention to letters, elementary sounds, 
words, and word-meanings—cultivated by the alphabet, phonic, and 
word methods—must be displaced by attention to sentence wholes 
and sentence meanings.+ 
Attention to the sentence still remains an important phase 
of widely used methods, as indicated in the following quo- 
tation: 
The only criterion acceptable today for the soundness of any method 
of teaching reading to a beginner is this: Does the method from the 
start train in power to grasp not a word but a related set of words, a 
sentence, an entire situation? Does the method proceed from wholes to 
parts and back again to clearer wholes? Does it advance from a unit 
of thought, a sentence, to the words as words without loss of the rela- 
tionship among the words? Is a flow of association maintained among 
the words as parts of the original whole from which they have been 
disentangled, or as parts of a different whole created anew out of the 
same words set in other relations? 
It is this relation idea that makes for true reading, as opposed to 
mere word calling with little or no consciousness of a higher unity. Does 
the method ingrain this sentence habit first, and then proceed, and not 
till then, to treat a word as a whole, analyze out of it the constituent 
parts, and synthesize these parts back again into the original word or 
new words ?? 
Silent reading should be taught. Enough has been said in 
our previous discussions in favor of devoting greater attention 
to instruction in silent reading to make it unnecessary to re- 
view the arguments here. It is sufficient for us here to note that 
the idea is being gradually adopted and that as a consequence

of Work, p. v. Silver, Burdett and Company, 1919.  
-P-A-G-E-184
  174 THE TEACHING OF READING 
methods are being modified. A recent manual treats of silent 
reading as being the most important phase of instruction: 
In our search for new roads to reading it is strange that we seldom 
think of the time that would be saved if pupils were trained to get the 
thought from a page at the first rapid, silent reading of it. If we can 
train a pupil so that at the first reading of a lesson he will do it inten- 
sively and grasp the thought expressed by the printed page, it will be 
unnecessary for him to read it again and again, repeating the printed 
text, word for word, until the thought is impressed on his mind. 
Silent reading is a necessity and any system that trains pupils to 
grasp the thought at sight is developing in the child an incalculable 
power for future education. In view of this fact it seems strange that 
silent reading has not been emphasized and that no method for training 
in it has been heretofore presented. When we consider that all our 
information from books is obtained through silent reading, and that oral 
reading is seldom employed for this purpose, we become convinced of 
the value of the former. If we reflect on the saving of time, we can 
readily perceive that rapid reading is also an essential. 
Along with silent reading rapid reading is coming to be con- 
sidered as an important outcome of instruction: 
Reading is a process of thinking. Training in rapid reading means 
training children to read for meaning. Silent reading is most important 
in establishing a rapid rate. Impelled by interest in the story, led on by 
the teacher’s question or suggestion, the pupil hastens to find the con- 
ditions of the next important event. 
About the time the pupil enters the fourth grade his silent-reading 
rate gains on his oral-reading rate, his eye hurries on ahead of his voice. 
From this time on more attention should be given to establishing a 
rapid rate of silent reading; less oral reading should be called for.?

MODERN METHODS IN READING 175 
Getting the meaning is a most important aim. One of the 
most potent factors in recent years in shifting the emphasis of 
instruction from the purely mechanical phase of reading to 
reading for meaning has been the demand for reading mate- 
rial which has content both interesting and familiar to children. 
Critics of the word method and sentence method, as originally 
devised, have based their criticisms in a very large measure on 
the fact that a thought basis is lacking in each. Not a few of 
our more recent systems of readers justify their publication on 
the grounds that they stimulate the child’s interest in reading 
by means of meaningful reading material. The following quota- 
tions, selected at random, are sufficient to show the trend of 
the times. 
The importance of utilizing the interest of children in their 
own familiar experiences and in stories is thus set forth: 
The primer work, covering the first sixteen to eighteen weeks, is a 
continued story about some of the well-known Mother Goose charac- 
ters, with the old rimes interwoven. The advantage of this arrange- 
ment is that the children start their work with a set of characters that 
are somewhat familiar and intensely interesting to them; and the 
interest is sustained by following these old friends instead of meeting 
strangers in every new selection. . . . 
The method suggested in the Manual is primarily a thought method. 
Reading is but a means to an end, and that end is thought-getting. 
Word-getting is necessary as a first step, but unless there is thought 
behind it, it makes no appeal to children and hence loses its force. The 
plan suggested is to carry forward the two operations, word-getting 
and thought-getting, simultaneously, holding the pupil’s interest and 
making the acquisition of words a pleasure because of the thought which 
they carry with them. 
The necessity of fostering the child’s desire to read through 
interesting content is the special plea of another system: 
Primary reading, as is true of all reading, is for the purpose of 
promoting thought, and right reading habits are laid by first developing

and Field Literary Readers, Book One, p. 2. Ginn and Company, Boston, 1917.
-P-A-G-E-186
  
176 THE TEACHING OF READING 
an interest in and love for reading. Reading is not, primarily, word 
study or word recognition. Even the simplest kind of reading means 
getting thought and feeling from written or printed characters. Oral 
reading is a still more complex process, involving, not only getting ideas, 
but all that goes to make oral expression of the thought and feeling. 
Children are led by desire and interest to get the thought, and the 
interest is sustained through their love for stories. The most important 
factor in teaching a child reading is to develop and foster his desire to 
read. The only means of ensuring these conditions is to provide reading 
matter that all children enjoy.? 
Another system makes a plea for interesting content as a 
means of developing literary appreciation: 
In the Merrill Readers the authors have provided a simple method of 
learning to read, combined with reading matter of high literary quality. 
The series aims to help the child to read easily and intelligently, and to 
give him reading matter that is of real interest and value to him. 
The ultimate aim of all school reading is to develop in pupils an 
appreciation of literature. While the mastery of the mechanics of 
reading and the formation of right reading habits—which involve the 
ability to get the thought from the printed page and to vocalize it 
correctly—are important factors in the teaching of reading, they 
should never lead us to neglect the ultimate aim. To realize this aim 
it is essential that the reading material should be of high literary quality 
and should have genuine interest for the child.? 
Summary. Methods of teaching reading have always paral- 
leled the conception people have had of the nature of the read- 
ing process. In prehistoric times writing and reading developed 
as kindred arts, each being considered the opposite of the other. 
With the development of an alphabet this conception became 
more firmly fixed in the minds of men. Consequently, since 
writing was in the beginning necessarily so nearly a process of 
word analysis, reading, which was its opposite, was looked upon

merely as a process of word-building. As such, reading was 
taught, and, because the conception was such a powerful one in 
its influence, the A B C method of teaching has prevailed even 
down to recent years. { 
In recent years modern methods of teaching reading hava 
developed. It has been shown that the development of modern, 
methods followed the dissatisfaction with the inadequate re- 
sults of the A B C method and paralleled the development of 
a new conception of the reading process. The new concep- 
tion established a basis first of all for the strictly word method 
and later for a number of modifications which have followed. 
These modifications relate themselves to the demands (1) for 
phonic analysis as a supplement of the word: method, (2) for 
ability to read in units larger than the word, (3) for instruction 
in silent reading, and (4) for content in the reading material.

3 CHAPTER XI 
READING IN THE FIRST GRADE 
In the chapter just preceding it was pointed out that a very 
close relationship has always existed between methods of 
teaching reading and the ideas people have had of the nature 
of the reading process. The dependence of the specific methods 
and devices which may be used in the classroom upon basic 
principles was there emphasized. It is well, therefore, that we 
begin our study of first-grade reading with a review of the gen- 
eral principles which seem to relate themselves especially to 
the work of this grade. 
General principles reviewed. The following general prin- 
ciples appear to be especially applicable: 
1. The problem of reading in the first grade is to train pupils 
to attach meanings to printed symbols. 
2. The meanings which pupils are to learn to attach to printed 
symbols have been derived by them from their reactions, feel- 
ings, and attitudes of mind toward the corresponding spoken 
words and the objects, actions, and situations for which they 
stand. 
3. The appropriate reactions, feelings, and attitudes need to 
be perfectly familiar to the children and already a part of their 
experience. It is necessary, therefore, to begin the work of the 
first grade by using printed symbols of words with which the 
children are acquainted. 
4. The content of the reading material used should not only 
be familiar but should also possess for the pupils a wealth of 
meaning. The more interesting the content the greater will be 
the desired results in interpretation. 
178

READING IN THE FIRST GRADE 179 
o 
5. Objects and pictures in the reading class should be used 
sparingly and with discretion. Care should be exercised that 
the pupils are employed with no means of distraction from the 
serious business of attaching meanings to printed symbols. 
6. The context is influential in determining meaning. Words 
in context,—in phrases and in sentences,—rather than words 
in isolation, should be the basis of the reading lessons. 
7. From the standpoint of recognition, words, not letters, pro- 
vide the logical starting point in teaching to read. In the be- 
ginning no attention should be paid to the complex of letters or 
phonic elements in the word. 
8. As the words of the reading lessons begin to be more diffi- 
cult and less familiar to the children, a limited amount of 
training in phonics should be undertaken. 
9. The analysis of words into letter-elements and sound- 
elements must not be ready-made for the children. 
10. The fact that reading is a mechanical process must not 
be forgotten. The various mechanical phases of the process 
need to be drilled upon and practiced by the children until at 
least a beginning is made toward rendering them automatic. 
The drills should be well organized and should be conducted in 
separate periods in order to avoid the possibility of distracting 
attention from the interpretative phase of reading. 
11. The training given the children should lead quickly to 
an instantaneous recognition of words and phrases. 
Main points of the discussion. Two chapters are devoted to 
the discussion of reading in the first grade. The present chapter 
discusses the various steps which are involved in beginning the 
task of teaching children to read, and emphasizes the impor- 
tance of reading as a thought process. In the following chapter 
reading as a mechanical process is emphasized ; there the neces- 
sity of giving training in phonics and word analysis is consid- 
ered together with a few of the special devices recommended 
for use in conducting such instruction and in perfecting the 
process of word and phrase recognition.

180 THE TEACHING OF READING 
Three steps to be followed in teaching reading to beginners 
are discussed in the present chapter; namely, (1) developing 
the content, (2) establishing relations, and (3) reading the 
story from the book. Each step is considered in order. 
The first lessons demand elaborate preparation. The chief 
requirement of an effective method of organizing the reading 
lessons of the first grade is to make sure that all lesson material 
has its basis in real, interesting content. If the problem of first- 
grade reading is to train pupils to attach meanings to printed 
symbols, it will be necessary for the teacher first of all to select 
and to present to the children lesson material which guarantees 
meaning in abundance. To this end it behooves the first-grade 
teacher to refrain from accepting bodily any ready-made word 
or sentence method of teaching children to read. The reason is 
that such a ready-made system is apt to attract the whole of 
the teacher’s attention to its very excellent and very carefully 
worked out mechanical organization, and to persuade her 
to forget that, in spite of the extreme necessity of perfecting 
the mechanical phases of the reading process, the close re- 
lationship to the interpretative phase must always be pre- 
served. It behooves’ the teacher rather to select from whatever 
ready-made systems may be at hand such a variety of methods 
and devices as best suits the purposes to be accomplished and 
to make sure that for each device and method selected the 
proper content. basis can be provided. The first step, therefore, 
toward the solution of the general problem of first-grade read- 
ing is for the teacher to see that there is a sufficient and proper 
development of the content which is to form the basis of the 
beginning series of lessons. The pupils are to attach meanings 
to printed symbols; meanings to attach must be provided for 
the children before they are introduced to the printed symbols 
which correspond. 
Content may be developed in several ways. No hard and fast 
rules applying to the manner of developing the content can 
be set down; indeed, it would be unwise to attempt a universal
-P-A-G-E-191
  
i 
READING IN THE FIRST GRADE 181 
application of any method of development. It remains for the 
individual teacher to devise the necessary ways and means, 
the effort being to make use of those methods which best fit the 
material to be presented. Telling the story to the children, 
conversation about various points brought out in the story, 
questions by the teacher and answers by the pupils, oral repro- 
duction of the story, recitations, and dramatization,—all have 
their parts to play in the acquisition by the children of an 
abundance of meaning. 
Children in the primary grades especially are constantly in 
danger of developing the idea that the reaction expected at the 
sight of printed symbols is the one of pronunciation; to say the 
words as they appear on the page a large number of children 
consider as satisfactory reading. Proper development of the 
content of the first reading lessons in a variety of ways is the 
only insurance against such a danger. In order to guard against 
the mistaken reaction of pronunciation it will be necessary for 
the teacher to employ every means possible to furnish the 
proper reactions of meaning. An abundance of meaning—of re- 
actions, feelings, and attitudes of mind—is the requirement ; 
in order to meet the requirement it is necessary that a variety of 
methods be employed. Let us examine a few typical methods. 
Telling the story. We will assume that the primer which is 
soon to be used by the children as a first book in reading opens 
with the familiar Jack and Jill rime and other Mother Goose 
rimes and little Mother Goose stories in prose. The teacher 
begins the work by telling a story of Jack and Jill: 
Once upon a time a little boy named Jack and a little girl named Jill 
lived with their father and mother in a little old house in a beautiful 
valley at the bottom of a high hill. Jack and Jill had lots of good times 
playing around their house and in the lanes and fields in the valley. 
They would play hide and seek around their house, and they would run 
races in the lanes, and they would gather flowers in the fields and make 
bouquets. They had such good times that the children who lived in the 
valley close by would come to play with them whenever they could.
-P-A-G-E-192
  182 THE TEACHING OF READING 
The story goes on with the telling of how hard their father 
and mother had to work and how helpful Jack and Jill tried 
to be—how they would go up the hill every day to Mother 
Goose’s well to get drinking-water for the family before they 
would think of asking to go out to play. 
One morning Jack and Jill had been helping their mother in the 
garden,—pulling weeds and doing all sorts of things,—and the garden 
looked very neat indeed. So their mother said: “Now, Jack and Jill, 
you may go up to Mother Goose’s well to get a pail of water. You may 
visit with Mother Goose a little while, and when you come back you 
may play all afternoon with the children who are coming to see you.” 
“O goody! goody!” said Jack and Jill. “Come on; let’s hurry.” 
With that they seized the pail and ran up the hill toward Mother 
Goose’s, carrying it between them. 
Pretty soon their father came in from his work and asked where the 
children were. The mother replied : 
Jack and Jill 
Went up the hill. 
Jack’s dog came running in, and in barking seemed to say, “Where 
are they?” Their mother understood, and answered: 
Jack and Jill 
Went up the hill. 
Jill’s kitty mewed the question, “Where did they go?” And the 
dog barked the answer : 
Jack and Jill 
Went up the hill. 
Jack’s chum came up from the village to play. He asked, “Where 
are Jack and Jill?” The father said: 
Jack and Jill 
Went up the hill. 
Jill’s friend came, too, and asked where they were, and their mother 
answered : 
Jack and Jill 
Went up the hill.
-P-A-G-E-193
READING IN THE FIRST GRADE 183 
Then a lot of children came in and said: ‘‘We came to play with 
Jack and Jill. Where are they?” And the father replied : 
Jack and Jill 
Went up the hill. 
Then they all ran out to see, and there they saw Jack and Jill up at 
Mother Goose’s well on the hill, and they all ran and shouted: 
Jack and Jill 
Went up the hill. 
Questions and Answers. After telling the story the teacher talks with 
the pupils about it, asking such questions as: Where did Jack and Jill 
go when they had finished work in the garden? What did the mother 
answer the father? What answer did Jack’s dog bark at Jill’s kitty? 
What did all the children shout as they ran? In answer to these ques-. 
tions the children are to give the rime. Often the answers should be in 
concert ; often individual pupils should be called upon for an answer. 
Thus every pupil has a chance to take part. 
Playing the Rime. Following the telling of the story and the discus- 
sion about it, the children play the rime. One child is Jack, one is Jill ; 
one plays the part of the mother, and one that of the father, and so 
on. The teacher may be Mother Goose, and her desk could be the 
well on the hill. In the dramatization the rime is repeated over and over. 
Thus, when the story has been told, reproduced by questioning, and 
dramatized, most pupils know the rime perfectly. It should be kept 
fresh in their minds through repetition—repetition in which the rime 
is really used, not merely repeated. 
Using the Chart. Pictures. In telling the story the teacher illustrates 
its various phases by appropriate pictures which she draws on the board 
and which appear in the chart which accompanies the primer. In recit- 
ing the story the children also use the drawing and the pictures for 
illustration. 
It is to be noted that in the telling of the story the rime is 
constantly being repeated in the exact way that it will appear in 
following lessons. Frequent repetitions of the rime are pro- 
vided for in the conversations about the story, in the dramatiza- 
tion of the story, and in the discussion of the pictures that 
illustrate the story. 
 
-P-A-G-E-194
184 THE TEACHING OF READING 
When to proceed to the second step in teaching beginners. 
The lessons and exercises in content development should be 
continued for two or three days or for a week until the follow- 
ing results have been accomplished : 
1. Until the first rime or sentence to be presented holds for 
every pupil a wealth of meaning; until an abundance of pleas- 
urable reactions, feelings, and attitudes is aroused at each 
repetition of the rime or sentence. 
2. Until every pupil has learned the rime or sentence exactly 
as it will appear in the lessons of the second step. 
The pupils now have in mind a rime or sentence which has 
become quite familiar. They have at their disposal plenty of 
meaning reaction. It remains now for them to connect the 
meaning reactions to the appropriate printed symbols. Estab- 
lishing the relation between meaning and symbol is, accord- 
ingly, the second step in the process of teaching reading to 
beginners. 
The relation between meaning and symbol must be estab- 
lished. Using the blackboard is the most convenient and effec- 
tive means at the disposal of the teacher in her efforts to train 
pupils to attach meanings to printed symbols. Specially pre- 
pared charts are also very useful, except that they permit no 
variation in the methods employed. What the teacher needs in 
taking this second step is a plan that is flexible, and one that is 
easily adjustable to the needs of the moment—one that makes 
use of both chart and board as the children’s knowledge of the 
rime demands. In this step relations are to be established. This 
means that more than a casual connection between meaning 
and symbol is to be made. The connection must become firmly 
fixed once for all through a variety of drills and repetitions. 
The step is taken in the following manner: 
The teacher writes on the blackboard the rime or sentence 
that the pupils have learned and for which they now have an 
abundance of meaning. She reads aloud as she writes. She may 
repeat the parts of the original story that lead to a repetition 
 
-P-A-G-E-195
READING IN THE FIRST GRADE 185 
of what is written, pointing at the same time to the board. By 
questions and discussions she impresses the fact that the 
“chalk has said” what the pupils have been learning. The chil- 
dren learn to recognize the written rime or sentence as a whole. 
Next, they learn to recognize certain words and phrases by 
their position in the sentence, by comparison with the same 
words in the sentence, and finally in isolation and without ref- 
erence to position. The drills and repetitions are continued 
until the necessary relations have become firmly established. 
The second step illustrated. An outline of the various parts, 
or “steps” to be taken, in the second step would be somewhat 
as follows: (1) recognition of the rime or sentence as a whole; 
(2) recognition of phrases and words by their position; (3) rec- 
ognition of phrases and words by comparison; (4) independent 
recognition of phrases and words; and (5) drill in rearrange- 
ment. The work may be done in the following way: 
I. Recognition of the Rime as a Whole 
The teacher retells the original story of Jack and Jill, writing the 
rime on the board, or pointing to it on the chart, each time she comes 
to it. 
Jack and Jill 
Went up the hill. 
The children help out with the story, and as they come each time to 
the rime the teacher makes clear that the “chalk says it” or the ‘chart 
says it.” As the children learn what is printed on the chart or written 
on the board, they read the rime as a whole, first from the board, then 
from the chart, from the board again, and so on. All the children read 
the rime. i 
II. Recognition by Position 
Now the teacher underlines the phrases Jack and Jill, up the hill, 
and has them read. The children read them as the teacher points, and 
1For this outline the author has drawn upon the discussions of Burchill, 
Ettinger, and Shimer in their “ Progressive Road to Reading: Plan of Work,” 
pp. 3-6. Silver, Burdett and Company, ror9.
-P-A-G-E-196
  
186 THE TEACHING OF READING 
point as the teacher calls the phrases. Words are next underlined and 
read the same way. The teacher underlines and points to words in 
order, and the children read them. The teacher calls the words, and 
one child after another points to as many as he can recognize by 
Position. 
III. Recognition by Comparison 
With the rime still on the board the teacher writes first phrases, then 
words, beneath the same phrases and words in the rime, and lets the 
children name them by comparison. The drill goes on, as the teacher 
writes the phrases and words on different parts of the board and points 
to them as they appear on the chart, until the children can recognize 
any phrase or word without reference to the rime. 
Jack and Jill went up the hill 
Jack and Jill up the hill 
and —- went up the hill 
Jack ‘Jill up hill 
This phase of the work should be thorough. Children cannot be ex- 
pected to recognize the phrases and words of the rime independently 
until the necessity for comparison is reduced through practice to a 
minimum. The slower children should be given extra help and more 
than the usual amount of practice so that they will learn to be sure 
of themselves from the beginning and not be inclined to resort to 
guesswork, 
IV. Independent Recognition 
When the teacher is sure that the children know the phrases and 
words without reference to their position, she should cover the rime on 
the chart and erase it from the board. The phrases and words should 
now be written in columns here and there on the board. Now the 
children should be required to recognize them instantly. Column after 
column is written in order to make new presentations of old words.

-P-A-G-E-197
  
READING IN THE FIRST GRADE 187 
Flash cards and the word and phrase lists of the chart should be 
used ina similar manner for drill in independent recognition. 
V. Drill in Rearrangement 
Sentences containing the now familiar words and phrases in rear- 
rangement are presented and read by teacher and pupils. This adds 
variety to the drills and at the same time tends to keep before the 
children sentence unity and the relation between words. The children 
are ready for this drill only when they can recognize readily all the words 
of the rime. If it is attempted too soon, the children will be apt to read 
haltingiy. The children can now recognize instantly seven words. 
The first step again: telling the story; playing the story. The 
teacher again calls upon a pupil to tell the story of Jack and 
Jill. The teacher asks, “Why did Jack and Jill go up the 
hill?” and elicits the answer : 
Jack and Jill 
Went up the hill 
To get a pail of water. 
She weaves into the original story the same question by the 
father, the dog, the cat, and the children in turn, and gives or 
secures the answer in each case: 
Jack and Jill 
Went up the hill 
To get a pail of water. 
The children play the story as before, constantly repeating 
the longer rime. 
The second step again. The five “steps” of the second step 
are taken again, this time with the longer rime, and the drills 
are continued until the children can recognize instantly the six 
additional words. And so the work goes on, the teacher pro- 
viding abundant meaning reaction in the first step and con- 
ducting interesting effective drills in the second. Thus each day
-P-A-G-E-198
  188 THE TEACHING OF READING 
the children review what they learned on preceding days, and 
each day they learn something new. Thus they come to master 
the entire Jack and Jill rime, other Mother Goose rimes, a 
Good-morning song, and others that are to be found in their 
primer. 
The teacher should write, not print. The blackboard work 
should be written in script, not in print. The reasons are: 
(1) The pupils must learn both forms; they are best learned 
simultaneously ; to delay the presentation of either form neces- 
sitates a repetition of the learning process that was carried on 
in connection with the other. (2) The printing of most teachers 
is quite as unlike the printed page as is their script. 
When to proceed to the third step in teaching beginners. 
The lessons and exercises in the first and second steps should 
be continued until the purposes of these steps are fully accom- 
plished, that is to say, until the relation between meaning and 
symbol has been fully established and until the symbols—the 
words and phrases—have become so familiar that they may be 
recognized instantaneously. The pupil is now ready to under- 
. take the third step, which is reading the story directly from the 
primer or reading book. — 
The third step is a necessary one. In the taking of the first 
and second steps, as described above, the children have not 
actually read, but have received considerable preparation for 
actual reading. They have acquired considerable meaning 
which relates to the story in their primer, and they have learned 
to attach the appropriate meanings to a small stock of printed 
(and written) symbols and to recognize instantaneously whole 
sentences, whole phrases, and words as wholes. But during the 
taking of the first and second steps they have not been engaged, 
except incidentally, at any time in reading one sentence fol- 
lowing another for the meaning they contain. Now since later 
reading is for the purpose of extracting meanings from printed 
symbols, here, in the third step, an opportunity should be of- 
fered to begin such a process. Reading for meaning is the dis-
-P-A-G-E-199
  READING IN THE FIRST GRADE 189 
tinctly pleasurable, profitable, and important phase of the 
reading process and the end toward which all instruction should 
lead. . 
The third step in instruction is a necessary and an important 
one, and their previous instruction has made the children ready 
to take it. As a result of having taken the first and second 
steps, the children are able to extract from the story of the 
primer the meaning which they have been engaged in attaching 
to the symbols which compose it. Now, immediately following 
the period of concentrated attention to meaning, is the time to 
give what practice is possible in reading for meaning. Such 
practice should continue from story to story to the extent of the 
children’s ability to indulge in it. 
The third step should not be prolonged. The very importance 
of the third step and the very evident pleasure manifested by 
the children in their reading of the first stories of their primer 
very frequently induce the teacher to prolong this step with a 
given story to the point of monotony. When the pupils have 
read the meaning out of their selection, they should be per- 
mitted to pass on to the next one, where the same steps are 
undertaken and the same processes are performed as before. 
Continually to repeat the reading of a story in the primer will 
cause the pupils to tire of the performance, and it is apt to 
lead them to believe that the reaction of pronunciation is the 
only one desired by the teacher. If the work of the first and 
second steps has been thorough, a single reading of the selec- 
tion at hand is frequently quite sufficient to enable each child 
to extract the maximum of meaning. 
The same causes—the importance of the step and the pleas- 
ure of the children in undertaking it—also lead the teacher to 
slight the work of content development and of establishing re- 
lations, and to undertake the reading of a story before the 
children are ready to read. It is obvious without further dis- 
cussion that meanings cannot be extracted from printed sym- 
bols before the two have been attached ; that the children must 
 
-P-A-G-E-200
  
190 THE TEACHING OF READING 
be prepared for their reading for meaning—otherwise their 
reading is a farce. 
What the three steps accomplish. A restatement. 1. In the 
first step the content of the selection of the primer or reading 
book is developed. 
2. In the second step the relations are made between mean- 
ing and symbol. Drill is continued until instantaneous recogni- 
tion results. 
| 3. In the third step the pupils read the selection for which 
\_ preparation was made in steps one and two. 
Steps one and two are important only as preparatory steps. 
The relation between the three steps can be seen. Steps one and 
two are important only as they prepare for step three; step 
three is the all-important one, because in it practice is given in 
reading for meaning. It is obvious that in the very beginning 
of the first year’s work most of the time needs to be devoted 
to steps one and two of preparation; but that as time goes on, 
and as the pupils learn to attach meanings to an ever-increasing 
stock of printed symbols, larger and larger proportions of time 
can be devoted to reading for meaning and smaller and smaller 
amounts are needed for preparation. 
With proper training the point is very quickly reached where 
little or no content development of the new story is needed, and 
where the exercises in establishing relations need not be quite 
so elaborate as in the beginning. Very many stories are to be 
found in the primers and first readers whose meaning is quite 
clear and which contain no more than one or two new words. 
With such stories elaborate preparation exercises are not needed. 
The pupils may be permitted to pass almost directly to the 
third step—that of reading for meaning. The point to be kept 
in mind by the teacher is that in the beginning quite elaborate 
and very carefully organized preparatory steps are to be under- 
taken with all the stories read, and that such preparation is to 
continue in connection with later stories only to the extent that 
may be necessary, and not beyond. As much practice as can be
-P-A-G-E-201
READING IN THE FIRST GRADE IQl 
provided should be given in reading for meaning. Such practice 
is necessary because of certain mechanical difficulties which 
are peculiar to the third step. 
. Pupils have difficulty in reading connectedly. However much 
preparation pupils may have had in the steps of content devel- 
opment and of establishing relations, they are not able when 
they begin to read to get the meaning from their story in any 
connected form. The pupils may get the meaning from the 
sentences one at a time, but their reading stops short of com- 
bining the thoughts into a larger whole. Single sentences may 
be read with good expression, and the children may give ev- 
idence in other ways that they grasp the thought of each sen- 
tence; but when they undertake to read a sentence whose 
meaning depends. on the thought of preceding sentences, they 
exhibit every evidence of failure to extract the meaning. 
The reason such failure exists is clear. It is that no training 
in reading sentences connectedly is given in the preparatory 
steps. In the establishment of relations between meaning and 
symbol the very longest unit of thought undertaken is the 
single sentence. Even this unit is too unwieldy for thorough 
training in attaching meanings to printed symbols, and the 
major part of the practice has to be given to word and phrase 
recognition. So the pupil comes to the third step with no train- 
ing in handling thought-units larger than the single sentence. 
The handling of thought-units larger than the sentence must 
be made a special feature of the pupil’s training if he is eventu- 
ally to acquire a mastery of such a process. Such training is not 
provided in the preparatory steps of content development and 
of establishing relations; it comes only with large amounts of 
practice in reading for meaning not only single sentences but 
whole paragraphs and entire stories. The difficulty in reading 
connectedly is a mechanical one; it requires time and plenty of 
practice for the pupils to become so familiar with the printed 
page that they can gather the thought as easily through that 
medium as they do through the medium of oral speech. The 
 
-P-A-G-E-202
  192 THE TEACHING OF READING 
problem of giving the necessary amount and proper kind of 
training in order to overcome this difficulty is an important one 
for the teacher to consider at this point in the training. Let us 
examine briefly the suggestions that are pertinent to the task 
of overcoming the difficulties encountered in the third step. 
1. The children should read selections which are easy and 
familiar. The difficulty of reading connectedly is in the main 
the mechanical one of carrying on the process of thinking nec- 
essary to the interpretation of the selection being read simul- 
taneously with the process of word and phrase recognition. 
The task is so difficult in the beginning as to require a rest 
period—a breaking off of the reading process—at the end of 
every sentence. The purpose of instruction is, necessarily, to 
eliminate such rest periods at the earliest possible moment. To 
this end the children should be given the opportunity to read 
selections in which the mechanical difficulties have been re- 
duced toa minimum. Interesting selections which have already 
been studied may be returned to frequently for sight reading. 
Simple selections chosen from supplementary readers involving 
familiar words furnish excellent material for this purpose. A 
blackboard revision of the story by the pupils in which all 
phases of difficulty have been skillfully eliminated by the 
teacher may be of assistance. Hectographed copies of such 
revisions may be distributed to the children and read at sight. 
Very simple selections of the types mentioned above should 
provide the material of frequent reading lessons. The selections 
may be read rapidly and fluently. The purpose is to develop 
those habits which are useful in the reading of more or less 
unfamiliar selections. 
2. The children should read selections which are repetitive 
in form. Fluency in reading results only from continued prac- 
tice intelligently organized. Not only should the children read 
selections of the type mentioned in the preceding paragraph, 
which provide drill in fluent reading from one day to the next;
-P-A-G-E-203
  READING IN THE FIRST GRADE 193 
they should read selections which possess the additional feature 
of providing repetitive drill material in their own make-up. An 
example of such selections is the cumulative tale: 
This is the house that Jack built. 
This is the cheese 
That lay in the house that Jack built, etc. 
A kid, a kid, my father bought 
For two pieces of money. 
Then came the cat 
That ate the kid 
That my father bought 
For two pieces of money. 
Then came the dog 
That bit the cat 
That ate the kid 
That my father bought 
For two pieces of money, etc. 
The constant repetitions of the cumulative tale afford a 
means of ready and natural retention with minimum effort, for 
they are indulged in not for the sake of reiteration but because 
they are a vital part of the story itself. Each time a given 
phrase or group of phrases is read it is more easily recognized 
than it was before, and the intimate relation between form and 
the thought expressed renders the acquisition of thought all the 
easier as the pupil reads from the beginning to the end of the 
selection. The mechanical difficulty of a given phrase is being 
reduced constantly the while the blending of phrases one with 
another is being encouraged by both form and thought. Fre- 
quent drills of this type increase the span of recognition and 
lead to improvement in rate of reading and in fluency of expres- 
sion. Other selections involving the use of sentences in repe- 
tition may be read with similar results. Such selections are 
valuable in securing fluent, connected reading of sentences. 
 
-P-A-G-E-204
  194 THE TEACHING OF READING 
3. The children should be instructed to engage in silent read- 
ing. Just as soon as the children begin to gain an independent 
mastery of the printed page, however inadequate such mastery 
may be, their attention should be directed to the activity of 
reading silently. The purpose of this type of instruction is to 
encourage independent effort on the part of the pupils in learn- 
ing to read, and to secure thereby a very important supplement 
to the efforts that are being put forth in class under the direc- 
tion of the teacher. The silent reading exercises may take a 
variety of forms. The children may study the selections which 
they are to read orally in class, they may read a story for the 
sake of being able to tell it to others, or they may read stories 
for their own personal pleasure. Often the class exercise may be 
given to the silent reading and obeying of commands and direc- 
tions which the teacher writes on the board. The discussion of 
reading in the second and third grades will deal with this topic 
somewhat more in detail. The following paragraph from an 
article by Professor Gray is pertinent at this point: 
The value of silent-reading exercises in the first grade depends largely 
upon the contribution which they make to the needs of the pupils. If 
the exercises are wisely chosen, it is probable that their use will result 
in rapid growth. If they are poorly selected, their use may prove of 
little value. Hence it is necessary that a teacher think of the various 
silent-reading exercises which may be used in terms of the kinds of 
growth which they will probably stimulate, and to select for immediate 
use those exercises which will secure the type of improvement of which 
the class stands most in need. From this point of view it is helpful to 
classify silent-reading exercises into the following types: (1) Those 
which emphasize reading as a thought-getting process. Such exercises 
range in length from a brief command which directs the pupil to do 
something to the long story which is read by the pupil in order that he 
may tell it to the class. (2) Those which secure better command of the 
mechanics of reading. Selections of medium difficulty can be studied 
profitably by the pupil. Very difficult selections should be avoided,

or studied only with the assistance of the teacher. (3) Those which 
increase the rate and span of recognition. Simple selections are appro- 
priate for this purpose inasmuch as the pupil can pass rapidly from 
the symbol to its meaning and pronunciation.+ 
4. The children should engage in oral reading not for the 
sake of expression, but for meaning’s sake. The discussion of 
Chapter IX of this book has emphasized the fact that in the 
primary grades oral reading should predominate, for the reason 
that it is closely connected with oral speech. The discussion of 
this point need not be continued here; the practice of empha- 
sizing oral reading, in these grades especially, is universal, thus 
making it unnecessary to seek justification by a continuance of 
the argument. What we should consider at this point, however, 
is the purpose of oral reading, whether for expression or for 
meaning. 
The ultimate aim of reading instruction is to train pupils to 
get meaning from the printed page. It is evident that the in- 
struction of the first. grade should be organized primarily with 
this aim in view, rather than for the sake of training pupils 
to express thought to others. Good expression is, of course, a 
valuable result to be sought after; it should come rather as a 
by-product of instruction than as a product of first importance. 
The bearing on our present discussion of the ways of over- 
coming the difficulties of reading connectedly is that the prog- 
ress of many pupils in reading for meaning—fluent, connected 
reading—is interrupted by the efforts of the teacher to secure 
good expression. The practice is an all too common one. The 
fluent, connected reading of the pupil is interrupted by the 
teacher sentence after sentence with corrections, questions, con- 
tradictions, etc.—all for the sake of securing the clear enuncia- 
tion of a word or the proper emphasis upon it. For example, the 
pupil reads “The little red hen found a bag of flour” and, in his 
haste to go forward and absorb the meaning of the next sen-

  196 THE TEACHING OF READING 
tence, slurs the pronunciation of “little red.” The teacher in- 
terrupts the reading with a correction, or with the question 
“W hat found a bag of flour ?” or she contradicts with the state- 
ment “The large white hen” etc. The pupil finally reads, “The 
little red hen found a bag of flour.” 
It should be borne in mind by the first-grade teacher that the 
pupil is learning to read not for the sake of providing pleasure 
and information for others, but for the sake of his own pleasure 
and enlightenment. The purpose of oral reading is to help the 
pupil to read for meaning, to provide him an outlet for his reac- 
tions, feelings, and attitudes toward the selection he may be 
reading. The progress he may be making toward the goal of 
fluent, connected reading for meaning ought not to be inter- 
rupted by the substitution of a secondary purpose of instruction 
or the one that is of primary importance. 
Summary. This will conclude our discussion of reading in 
the first grade as considered from the standpoint of emphasis 
on reading as a thought process. The following chapter will 
continue the present discussion, but will stress especially the 
devices and methods necessary to be followed in order to per- 
fect the mechanical phases of reading. The steps to be fol- 
lowed in teaching reading to beginners have been discussed. 
They follow: 
1. In the first step the content of the selection of the primer 
or reading book is developed. 
2. In the second step the relations are made between mean- 
ing and symbol. Drill is continued until instantaneous recog- 
nition results. 
3. In the third step the pupils read the selection for which 
preparation was made in steps one and two. 
In each instance the importance of the step under discussion 
was considered. In connection with the discussion of the third 
step the importance of training in connected, fluent reading was 
emphasized. Four suggestions were made which bear upon 
methods of training, as follows : 
 
-P-A-G-E-207

1. The children should read selections which are easy and” 
familiar. 
2. The children should read selections which are repetitive in 
form. 
3. The children should be instructed to engage in silent 
reading. 
4. The children should engage in oral reading not for the 
sake of expression, but for meaning’s sake.

CHAPTER XII 
READING IN THE FIRST GRADE (CONTINUED) 
Purpose of the chapter. The purpose of the present chapter 
is to call attention to the need of special instruction and drill 
in the mechanics of reading and to discuss briefly a few of the 
devices that are useful and appropriate for carrying on such 
work. The discussion of the chapter will bear on the following 
points: (1) the importance of phonics, (2) the general method 
of conducting instruction in phonics, (3) the importance and 
general principles of effective drill, (4) word drills and typical 
devices that are useful in perfecting the mechanical phases of 
reading, and (5) the importance of practice in reading for 
meaning. Topics (1) and (3) are brief reviews; the remaining 
topics comprise the body of the discussion. 
A general principle that was reviewed in the preceding chap- 
ter needs to be restated in part here: the drills on the various 
mechanical phases of reading should be well organized and 
should be conducted in separate periods in order to avoid the 
possibility of distracting attention from the interpretative phase 
of reading. 
Phonic analysis is an important device of instruction. The 
preceding chapter was descriptive of a method of teaching 
children to read by means of calling attention to the meanings 
of the easy, familiar words of the children’s vocabulary and of 
attaching these meanings to the appropriate printed symbols. 
By using such a method the teacher is successful in getting her 
pupils to read the selections of their primers and elementary 
readers in a remarkably short time. It might seem that con- 
tinued emphasis on the various steps of this method is all that 
is required of the teacher, and that by such a means the pupils 
198
-P-A-G-E-209
  
READING IN THE FIRST GRADE 199 
will in time develop into effective readers. We need but to re- 
turn to the discussion of Chapter VI to find the evidence which 
proves the inaccuracy of such an assumption. 
In Chapter VI we discover that the strictly word method of 
instruction breaks down in the midst of the work of the first 
year, owing to the fact that the child becomes distracted by his 
efforts to recognize the somewhat difficult and unfamiliar words 
he is beginning to meet. Without proper guidance the distrac- 
tion becomes more and more serious as the pupil is led to attack 
more and more difficult reading material. His wretched at- 
tempts to read under the burden of such a handicap we found 
to be so very unproductive of results as to deserve to be char- 
acterized as “periods of confusion.” Phonic analysis is the 
device necessary to train pupils to avoid periods of confusion. 
The school finds that the child distracts himself by his own 
unguided efforts ; the school attempts, therefore, to organize its 
work so as to distract the child to some purpose by teaching 
him the while how to master distractions. 
Phonic analysis must not be imposed upon children as a 
ready-made system. The purpose of leading the children to 
undertake the phonic analysis of words defines the extent to 
which the school ought to emphasize such instruction. The 
school is not concerned with having the children gain a mas- 
tery of phonics as a complete system; it does not organize its 
instruction for the sake of thoroughness in phonics. Only as the 
children need to make use of phonics in attacking new and 
difficult words does the school organize instruction in the use 
of that device. For this reason no attempt is made to start the 
children with the simplest phonograms and to lead them to a 
knowledge of those which are more and more difficult until 
finally they have been made familiar with a complete phonic 
system. The principle “from simple to complex” does not op- 
erate here any more than it does in connection with the teach- 
ing of word recognition. The principle to be followed is to lead 
the pupils to analyze the necessary phonograms out of their
-P-A-G-E-210
  200 THE TEACHING OF READING 
familiar stock of words and to recombine these phonograms 
into words which are new and heretofore unfamiliar. The pro- 
cedure is not from “parts to wholes,” but from “wholes to 
parts, and back again to different wholes.” The following 
paragraphs are descriptive of the method to be followed. 
Ear training requires clear enunciation and articulation of 
words. From the very first day of school ear training may be 
given the pupils by means of the conscious effort on the part of 
the teacher to enunciate and articulate clearly. Such an effort 
should be required of the children to the extent of their ability 
to comply. Slurring the sounds of the consonants ought to be 
corrected and never again permitted. For example, the ¢ should 
be plainly heard in sent and went; likewise, the d in and and 
find. Defective pronunciation of consonants ought to be reme- 
died as early as possible, the pupil taking his cue from the 
teacher as to the correct position of the external organs of 
speech. Illustrations are the tongue between the teeth in sub- 
stituting the correct them for the incorrect dem; the teeth to- 
gether and the tongue held back in saying six instead of thix; 
biting the lower lip in learning to say very instead of wery. 
Careful attention to the enunciation and articulation of 
words has a purpose entirely apart from formal instruction in 
phonics. That it is also a very fitting and necessary introduc- 
tion to such work cannot be denied. It is futile to call upon 
pupils to analyze words into their sound elements before they 
are able to make accurate discriminations of these sounds by 
ear. Recognition of the sound elements of the spoken word by 
means of the ear is necessary before recognition of the phono- 
grams of the written word:by means of the eye can take place. 
Familiar words provide the starting point of training in 
phonics. When the pupils can recognize instantaneously the 
small stock of easy, familiar words which make up the vocabu- 
lary of the early part of their primers, they are able in a meas- 
ure to recognize the similarity in sound of a number of these 
words and the similarity in appearance of their printed sym-
-P-A-G-E-211
  
READING IN THE FIRST GRADE 201 
bols. Now it is that phonetic training can begin, inasmuch as 
the burden of carrying on phonic analysis and phonic synthesis 
should as far as possible be placed on the pupils themselves. 
Moreover, the children must be made acquainted with the 
process of taking words apart and putting them together in 
connection with easy and familiar words before they may be 
expected to carry on such a process in connection with some- 
what difficult and unfamiliar words. 
Let us say that the following words and their printed symbols 
have become familiar to the pupils: Aili, till, fill, will, and mit, 
mid, mince, milk, and that the word mill has not as yet been 
taught by the process of step two, as described in the preceding 
chapter. The purpose is to lead the pupils to recognize the new 
word mill through efforts somewhat more independent than 
those necessary for step two. The process to be learned is the 
one of analyzing out of the two groups of words the phono- 
grams mi and Ul and of blending these phonograms to make the 
new word mill. In teaching the process there are four steps. 
The first step calls attention to known words arranged in a 
family, or sound, group. The pupils have learned to,recbgnize 
the words Aill, till, fill, will, in the order of their appearance in 
their primer, but as yet there has been no conscious effort on 
their part to relate the words one with another. The teacher 
writes the words on the board 
hill re 
till 
fill 
: will 
and the pupils recognize and pronounce them in different or- 
ders. The similarity in sound is mentioned and discussed. The 
common element, //, of the four words is distinguished and pro- 
nounced separately. 
The second step analyzes words into their sound elements. 
The very prominence of the phonogram di, due to the fact that on  
-P-A-G-E-212
202 THE TEACHING OF READING 
it is common to the words of the group, in itself may lead the 
pupils to recognize the essential difference in the words. The 
sounds of the phonograms hi, ti, fi, wi, may be emphasized as 
follows: have the pupils pronounce each word slowly. The fact 
that the phonogram UI has been so thoroughly emphasized gives 
opportunity for the pupils to concentrate on the sounds of the 
initial phonograms. The last part of the words may be cov- 
ered while the pupils pronounce slowly the initial sounds. The 
words may be written 
hi-1l hi- 
ti-ll i 
fll or fl wi- ll wi- 
By the end of the second step the pupils are able to distinguish 
and to pronounce separately the five phonograms of the four 
words. : 
It should be mentioned that the sound groups (// and mi) are 
used here only for purposes of illustration and that the work of 
phonetic instruction does not necessarily begin with their use. 
Indeed, considerable effort may be put forth with profit by the 
children to learn the phonograms that represent the elementary 
sounds and to master the initial blend of consonant and vowel 
before they are led to deal very much with word families and 
sound groups. To illustrate: when the children know the words 
mat, mill, am, and him they can be led to discover that the 
initial sound in mat and mill and the final sound in am and him 
are the same, that this is the sound of m which,they have 
learned in their ear training from such spoken words as mamma 
and my, and that this sound is represented by the letter m. 
By similar methods the pupils can learn the short @ sound 
from such words as at, am, and and. After they have also 
learned n from no, not, ten, den, or similar known words, they 
can blend these three sounds (m, a, m) to give a new word, man. 
Drill on the initial blend of consonant and vowel, to give the
-P-A-G-E-213
  
  READING IN THE FIRST GRADE 203 
open sound, is useful and appropriate at this point: man, man; 
hot, hot; ten, ten; cat, cat. By further analysis of familiar 
words and practice on the blends the pupils will gradually learn 
the phonograms that represent the elementary sounds and 
gradually develop a method of attack on new words, and with 
this knowledge and skill will come increased power in word 
recognition. 
Nore. Attention is called to the form of the word analysis here rec- 
ommended, which unites initial consonants with the vowel which follows 
to give the open sounds hi, ti, fi, wi. If we pronounce a monosyllable, 
such as fill, slowly, we find that the stress is upon the blend ¢é, and that 
we naturally and correctly pronounce it éé-I/ rather than ¢-ill. An initial 
consonant cannot well be pronounced apart from the vowel that follows 
it. When an effort is made to do this another obscure vowel sound 
inevitably is formed, and the word becomes tu-ill. 
This fact the teacher should keep in mind in grouping words into 
families, or sound groups, for purposes of phonic instruction. The 
principle should be to group such words as emphasize the natural blend 
of initial consonant with following vowel to give the open sound. At- 
tention is called to the superiority of the sound group. 
mi-t 
mi-d

which emphasizes the open mi sound. The tendency in pronouncing a 
sound group like Hill, till, fill, will, is to emphasize the common ele- 
ment, the i/J sound, and to make the incorrect analysis

instead of the correct one

ti-l

-P-A-G-E-214
  204 THE TEACHING OF READING 
The hill, till, fill, will, family is used to illustrate the first three steps, 
not because of its excellence as a sound group but in order to call atten- 
tion to what the teacher should seek to avoid, as well as to show the 
correct method of analysis when such groups are suggested and used. 
Family phonograms, like the word ill in hill, till, fill, will, or the 
part of a word of in hot, not, lot, are useful in building up words me- 
chanically after the pupil has mastered the initial blend. Initial blends, 
like mi in mit, mid, mince, milk, are not, except for purposes of analysis, 
family phonograms, or sound groups. In word-building they simply rep- 
resent the first step in the blend. Mill is composed of three elementary 
sounds which are blended, and mi /l represents the first step in the blend 
and mill the second step. ll (in mill) is a family phonogram and is 
used mechanically in building up word families. Mi (in mill) indicates 
the blend of the two initial sounds in a word. It shows something to 
do or something done. The former is correctly used as a sound group in 
word synthesis after a certain mastery of word analysis has been at- 
tained; the latter is correctly used as a sound group in word analysis. 
The third step recombines the sound elements into the orig- 
inal wholes. To gain an understanding of how the parts of a 
word are blended to give the word follows next as a third step 
of instruction. The pupils are not only to learn that a word 
may be analyzed into separate sound elements but also to be 
made conscious of the fact that a blending of these sounds pro- 
duces the word as a whole. In this step no emphasis is placed 
upon the phonograms ; indeed, once the ability of phonic analy- 
sis of a word has been gained, the effort should be to turn 
attention away entirely from the process of analysis to the proc- 
ess of synthesis. Recognizing words as wholes is the impor- 
tant outcome of instruction in phonic analysis, not alone the 
ability to carry on the process of analysis. 
The first three steps which have just been described cover the 
process of proceeding from wholes to parts and from these parts 
back again to the original wholes. The purpose of the instruc- 
tion is not for its own sake, but to lead the children to the 
ability to understand the fourth step, which is the building of 
new words,
-P-A-G-E-215
  READING IN THE FIRST GRADE 205 
The fourth step recombines the sound elements into different 
wholes. Before the pupils are able to proceed to the task of 
building new words they must be made acquainted with the 
phonograms that are to be derived from more than one word 
family. Accordingly the first three steps of the process of 
phonic analysis and synthesis are repeated with the words of 
other sound groups; for example, with the words mit, mid, 
mince, milk, etc. This repetition is carried on until the pupils 
are able, largely on their own initiative, to take a part of one 
known word or word family and a part of another and to join 
the two elements to form another word which is familiar, but 
which they recognize in print now for the first time. In the 
present illustration the mi sound of one family is blended with 
the // sound of another to form the new word mill. 
The four steps of training are repeated with the words of a 
number of families, or sound groups, in order to acquaint the 
children with as large a stock of phonograms as possible. As 
instruction proceeds, the burden of the work of analysis and 
synthesis can be placed more and more upon the children. In 
every case the discovery of the heretofore unknown printed 
symbol of a familiar word should as largely as possible be the 
children’s discovery. This is to be the aim and chief outcome of 
the instruction; namely, independence in attacking new words. 
The formation of new words out of familiar phonograms ought 
not, therefore, to be imposed by the teacher. The teacher should 
suggest and direct; the pupils should make the discovery, so 
that, once made, the discovery will be theirs. 
Caution: unfamiliar words should not be emphasized in the 
phonic drills. The implication of the foregoing paragraphs is 
that the work in the four steps of phonic instruction shall be 
thorough and continued until the children are able to make an 
intelligent attack on the new words they meet from day to day. 
We need at this point to remind ourselves of the danger to the 
process of reading for meaning that follows an overemphasis on 
phonic instruction.
-P-A-G-E-216
206 THE TEACHING OF READING 
The carefully organized and systematic drills in phonics that 
are conducted by the thoroughgoing and conscientious first- 
grade teacher lead the children immediately to undertake the 
work of phonic analysis and synthesis with a great deal of in- 
terest and zeal. As soon as the children discover what things 
are to be done, they find the doing of them very satisfactory 
because of the pleasure they get in the abundant and varied 
mental activity that is required. Just at this point there enters 
a danger. Pronunciation is the important outcome of phonic 
instruction; everywhere the reaction of pronunciation receives 
the emphasis. Because of their great interest in the activities of 
the phonic instruction and drills, the pupils of the first grade 
may be led to believe that the reaction of pronunciation is the 
important one and the one demanded by the teacher. Reading 
for meaning may be lost sight of in the efforts of the pupils to 
meet the demands of the school for phonetic development and 
skill. It is clear that the school ought to organize its instruction 
in phonics in such a way as to avoid the danger thus described. 
At this point in the training it offers, the school faces a problem 
it cannot afford to ignore. 
The solution of the problem is to be sought in the kind of 
phonic instruction that does not entirely divorce itself from the 
reactions of meaning which the pupils may have acquired. To 
this end it is necessary that the familiar words of the children’s 
reading vocabulary and the words which are to appear immedi- 
ately in their reading lessons be made the basis of the instruc- 
tion in phonics. When such words are used the attention of the 
pupils cannot be withdrawn entirely from the familiar reac- 
tions of meaning, however much the lessons in phonics may 
emphasize the reaction of pronunciation. On the other hand, 
when unfamiliar words are used the only reaction possible to 
the children is the one of pronunciation. It is necessary, there- 
fore, that the instruction in phonics should lead the children to 
discover the sounds of familiar words rather than the sounds of 
words that are unfamiliar. It is permissible, however, to use
-P-A-G-E-217
  
  READING IN THE FIRST GRADE 207 
such unfamiliar words as appear in succeeding reading lessons, 
because immediately following the emphasis that is placed on 
the reaction of pronunciation the attention of the children be- 
comes centered on the meanings of the words in question. In 
such instances the reactions of pronunciation are forced imme- 
diately to surrender the right of way to the more important 
reactions of meaning. 
This will conclude our review of the importance of phonic 
instruction and our discussion of the general methods of con- 
ducting such instruction. We turn now to a review of the 
importance and general principles of effective drill and to a 
consideration of a few typical drill. devices. 
Drill is necessary in order to complete the learning process. 
In our discussion of the importance of emphasis on mechanics 
in Chapter VI we were impressed with the fact that once a 
process has been learned, considerable drill is necessary, else 
the process is soon forgotten and the learning has been for 
naught. Another reason for drill stood out with equal force. 
It was that the process of reading for meaning is so important 
as to require as much of the reader’s attention and energy as he 
can spare from the necessary process of mastering mechanics, 
and that, therefore, the mechanical phases of the reading proc- 
ess should be made as easy as possible by making them, 
through drill and practice, as automatic as possible. Certain 
general principles of effective drill were suggested in the dis- 
cussion of Chapter VI. A restatement at this point is desirable. 
We may add others to suit our present purposes. 
Principles of effective drill. Professor Parker, in his inter- 
esting chapter on “Drill and Practice,”* discusses what he 
considers the six principles of effective drill. Five of these are 
especially applicable to our present discussion. They follow: 
1. Only correct practice makes perfect ; therefore, 
a. Delay drill until a correct start is assured.

208 THE TEACHING OF READING 
b. Always subordinate speed to accuracy. 
2. Avoid wasting time on nonessential and accessory 
processes. 
3. Secure zeal, interest, and concentration of attention with 
short, snappy, interesting, and varied drills. 
4. Use ready-made drill systems. 
5. Continue drill until automatic responses are secured. 
Preceding discussions have suggested these principles of drill. 
We are at liberty to pass over a discussion of them here in our 
effort to consider certain typical drill devices which exemplify 
them. Let us consider a few of the drill devices which have 
been used with success in the teaching of reading in the first 
grade. 
Effective drill devices. The following drill devices have been 
used with success by first-grade teachers. They are quoted di- 
rectly from three typical sources of such material; namely, (1) a 
teachers’ manual of a recently published reading system, (2) a 
textbook of special methods of teaching reading, and (3) a text- 
book of general methods of teaching in elementary schools. 
They exemplify the principles of drill which were stated in the 
foregoing topic. 
The manual of one well-known reading system suggests the 
following devices: 
Climbing the Hill. Let the children go uphill after Jack and Jill. 
Have words arranged like this: 
Jack and Jill 
crown 
broke 
hill 
went 
up 
See how many children can climb up to “Jack and Jill” on the top of 
the hill without falling; that is, without missing a word. 
Boxing Words. Let children “‘box” words that they can recognize, and 
send them away to New York or Chicago or any other place. This is 
 
-P-A-G-E-219
READING IN THE FIRST GRADE 209 
  
    done by putting a box, or square, around the word, as [tumbling], {broke} 
Let the child who boxes the word tell where he will send it, and proceed 
until all the words are boxed and sent away (erased). 
The Merry-go-round. A circle with words around the circumference 
is drawn on the board. See who can make the merry-go-round go round 
the fastest; that is, see who can read all the words the most quickly. 
Climbing Ladders. Write columns of words representing ladders. 
(1) A pupil climbs up and down the ladders until he falls, by making a 
mistake ; then another tries. (2) One pupil climbs until he falls; then 
the others help him up again by saying the word, and he continues climb- 
ing. At the second or third fall someone else may take his place. Re- 
arrange the words every few days, making new ladders to prevent the 
children from identifying words by position. 
The Pail of Water. Draw a “pail of water” with a number of words 
written on it. See how many children can carry it without spilling any 
of the water; that is, name all the words without missing.t 
Silent Reading through Action Sentences. Let one of the pupils im- 
personate Mother Goose and be seated in a chair at the front of the 
toom. Let two others represent Jack and Jill respectively. Say to the 
class that today the chalk is going to tell them what to do. Ask John 
to do what the chalk says. Then write on the board See Mother Goose. 
John will look at Mother Goose. Then tell Mary that the chalk is going 
to say something to her. Write Run to Mother Goose. Mary will run 
to Mother Goose. Ask Jane to do what the chalk says; then write 
Run to Jack. ... Repeat these directions in varying order to each 
member of the class. . . . 
This exercise is valuable not only because it provides an opportunity. 
for drill on the sentences which have been written but also because it 
motivates them.   
The following devices are copied from a textbook for teachers 
on the principles and methods of reading in the public schools:

met in sentences during some previous lesson, or words so similar that 
he should be able to recognize them very quickly. The “perception”

by the teacher and printed with a Fulton Sign Marker, a useful tool 
for every primary teacher. The speed of this exercise should be gradu- 
ally increased, but never so far as to result in haphazard guessing by 
the children. 
2. Hide these cards about the room. Send groups of children to 
find and bring before the class all they can recognize. 
3. Match the words on these cards with words upon the board or 
chart. This is a device to be used early in the first year. 
4. The purpose of this exercise is to teach the child that certain 
symbols, regardless of position, size, or color, always represent a cer- 
tain word. 
(a) Write one of these words at a time among other words on the 
blackboard. 
(b) Write it in different places on the blackboard. ° 
(c) Write it in different sized letters. 
(d) Write it with different colored crayon. 
5. Have the children build words with letter cards. This is a good 
device for seat work. 
6. Promote a contest between members of the class in pronouncing 
rapidly the words to which the teacher or some child points, the words 
being before the eyes of the whole class. 
A variety of other devices for enlivening this formal exercise, called 
a word drill, can be used to aid in reaching the desired results. When- 
ever possible the imagination of the child should be stimulated by the 
thought of the lesson. If the lesson is the story of ‘“Hiawatha’s 
Brothers,” the teacher writes on the board such words as: 
beavers acorns 
reindeer timid 
squirrel built 
rabbit swiftly 
lodges hid 
ran why 
She then says, “Play you are Hiawatha. All these words are your friends, 
hiding in the forest. See if you can find them out and tell their names.” 
Or, “At first the beasts were a little afraid of Hiawatha and ran away. 
How many can you catch before this eraser makes these friends disap-
-P-A-G-E-221
    
READING IN THE FIRST GRADE 211 
pear?” She erases a word here and there, the children pronouncing as 
fast as words vanish from the board. 
Or, if the lesson is one about the seashore, the teacher may suggest, 
“T have written all these words in the sand. Charlotte may play she is 
a big wave. She may wash away (erase) all she can get (pronounce).” 
Or, “See all these pretty shells! Who can get a basketful of them?” 
The children pronounce in turn and claim as theirs the words they 
recognize. 
These devices should be appropriate to the moment; it is almost 
impossible to suggest suitable ones for general use. They are numerous, 
but their use should be limited.t 
A final quotation is introduced to illustrate how the teacher 
may in a few minutes employ a variety of devices. Typical 
devices are given, together with the principles of drill they are 
intended to exemplify. 
Six tricks in first-grade drills with vocabulary cards. A first-grade 
teacher, in about the seventh week of school, had taught the children 
to read a chart containing such sentences as the following : & 
We have two pets. 
They are white mice, etc. 
‘These sentences had been used by the children in telling about their 
two mice. At the present time we are interested in part of the drill 
which followed the reading of the chart as a whole. 
At the beginning of the reading lesson the next day the teacher had 
arranged on the blackboard ledge eight stiff cards, on each of which was 
printed one of the words learned recently ; namely, “mice,” “white,” 
- “have,” etc. The pupils were seated in little chairs at the front of the 
room. The lesson proceeded as follows: 
1. The teacher gathered the cards and, holding them so that the 
class could see, said, ‘Here we have some of our old words. Let’s see 
if we can name them.” She then displayed one card after the other. 
The class, whispering, named the words in concert. 
2. The class then stood up. The teacher handed a child a card. If 
he named the word successfully, he sat down, keeping the card and 
holding it so that the word could be seen from the front of the room.

  212 THE TEACHING OF READING 
3. After all the cards were given out, each of the children that still 
remained standing was permitted to pick, from those sitting, a card 
containing a word which he could name correctly and then to be seated. 
Finally all were seated. 
4. The teacher then said, “I want the card which says ‘mice.’”” The 
child having it ran quickly and gave it to the teacher. This was re- 
peated until she had all the cards. 
5. The cards were then redistributed among the children by the 
teacher and called for again as in paragraph 4. As attention was be- 
ginning to flag slightly, the teacher said, “I think some of the children 
are sleepy”; whereupon these children sat up and paid attention. 
6. The teacher then placed the cards in a row on the blackboard 
ledge, the children reading them quietly in concert as each was placed. 
7. The drill was then concluded with the following game: A chosen 
child ran into the cloak room. Another child ran quickly and pointed at 
a word, for example, “mice,” then returned to his seat. The child in 
the cloak room returned. He pointed at a word, for example, “‘have,” 
and said, “Is it ‘have’?” The children replied in concert, “No.” He 
continued to point at and name words until he said, “Is it ‘mice’?” 
Whereupon all the children clapped their hands, and he returned to 
his seat. The game was then repeated once. 
Eight words, six tricks, six minutes, ten repetitions at intervals and 
with attention, application. After the class was seated and ready for 
the above drill, the total amount of time consumed by it was about six 
minutes. In this brief time six different tricks, stunts, or devices were 
used. The necessity for this variety is shown by the fact that the 
attention of the little six-year-olds began to flag after the fifth step in 
the drill, The teacher, consequently, proceeded quickly to the seventh 
step, which involved more physical activity for some and more inter- 
esting activity for all; namely, watching to see if the child guessed the 
right word and clapping their hands when he did. By these devices, each 
word was attentively observed by most of the children at least ten 
times. The observations of each word were not consecutive however, 
the attention having been drawn to other words in the intervals which 
elapsed between the observations of any given word. After the drill 
had concluded with the game which provided for physical activity, the 
reading lesson was continued by reading on the chart the story of their 
pets, in which the words of the drill occurred in sentences.*

READING IN THE FIRST GRADE 213 
The teacher of first-grade reading is concerned with the or- 
ganization of a variety of effective drill devices, not for the sake 
of finding tasks to occupy the spare time of her pupils but 
for the sake of rendering automatic the mechanical phases of 
the reading process. The teacher, accordingly, gives carefully 
worked-out and well-organized systems of drill which gradu- 
ally develop in the pupils such powers as the ability to make an 
intelligent attack on new words, the ability to recognize in- 
stantaneously familiar words once their printed symbols have 
been learned, and the ability to recognize and to read in mean- 
ingful phrase wholes. The interpretative phase of the reading 
process is closely interwoven with the mechanical phase. For 
the sake, then, of being able to read for meaning without inter- 
ruption—for the sake of the reader’s being able to devote the 
whole of his attention to the important process of thought get- 
ting—the mechanics of reading needs to be rendered automatic 
through intelligent practice and drill. 
Practice is needed in reading for meaning. Not only is con- 
siderable practice necessary in order to overcome the difficul- 
ties of the strictly mechanical phases of the reading process but 
also in order to develop connected, fluent reading. The pre- 
ceding chapter was clear on this point. One learns to read by 
much practice in reading. The point is important enough 
(aside from its relation to the present discussion of practice 
and drill) to return to for a second examination. Our present 
purpose is to consider the materials that are suitable for prac- 
tice in reading for meaning and the extent of the practice that 
is to be indulged in. 
The content of primary reading should be varied. The re- 
quirement of variety is important for two reasons. In the first 
place, much practice in reading cannot be secured by reading 
and re-reading the same selections. The preceding chapter 
pointed out the danger pupils encounter of adopting the reac- 
tion of pronunciation if a selection is re-read too frequently. 
Generally speaking the more frequently a given selection is 
 
-P-A-G-E-224
214 THE TEACHING OF READING 
read, the less practice it provides in reading for meaning. The 
reading of a variety of selections which provide meaning in a 
variety of ways is the requirement. A second reason for variety 
in the content is that it accords with the principles of effective 
drill. Let us consider the extent to which variation may 
be carried. 
Klapper suggests the following types of stories as suitable 
for primary reading and as necessary to meet the requirement 
for variety: 
. Nursery rimes. 
. Personal stories of class and school life and experience. 
Fairy tales. 
Animal and nature stories. 
Folk tales and fables. 
Cumulative tales. 
Humorous stories. 
Dramatic stories. 
. Bible stories. 
. Myths, legends, traditions, etc.+ SOM 
WAARY 
DH 4 
Advocates of silent reading would add to this classification 
still another type of reading matter—factual material. 
“As the prime purpose is to get the thought, the material 
must lend itself readily to this end and must contain a thought 
that is worth while. This is even more important in the primary 
grades than it is in the more advanced grades.”? 
Illustrative of the type of reading selections here referred to 
as “personal stories of class and school life and experience” 
are the methods suggested in the following excerpts from the 
writings of Professor Gray: 
. .. Ina number of schools teachers use leaflets which have been 
printed for their special use. One teacher used a leaflet entitled “Our

Company, New York, 1916.

Grocer.” The amount of interest which the pupils displayed, the eager- 
ness with which they read, and the amount of constructive thinking 
displayed bythe pupils during the exercise served as strong recom- 
mendations in favor of reading selections which make a direct appeal 
to the interests of the pupils. In other schools objective materials 
from the museum were made the basis of the reading lesson. One 
teacher placed a mounted bluebird before the class, and the reading 
lesson grew out of carefully directed discussions concerning the bird. 
The superior results secured through the use of these carefully selected 
exercises, as contrasted with the results secured through the use of some 
of the stereotyped reading selections, justify the recommendation that 
a widespread movement be initiated by teachers to introduce mate- 
rials which appeal more directly to the interests of pupils and which 
lend themselves, because of their more vital content, to effective 
presentation.+ 
The teacher questioned the pupils to find out what things were needed 
to make a bowl of goldfish. In answer to her questions the pupils sug- 
gested the following: bowl, water, shells, weeds, and fish. The teacher 
wrote these words on the board as they were suggested, thus affording 
opportunity for the association of meanings and symbols. At the same 
time the teacher gave cards to the pupils upon which had been written 
plainly the words under discussion. The pupils attached these cards 
to the appropriate objects. 
The teacher then said that they were ready to put the things to- 
gether. As she wrote the following suggestions on the board the pupils 
read them, and the one who read the sentence first was assigned the 
task suggested in the direction. 
Get the bowl. 
Put water in the bowl. 
Put shells in the water. 
Put weeds in the bowl. 
Put fish in the water. 
Later in the day the pupils related their experience of the morning 
and composed the following story, which was written on the board by 
the teacher:

Fish like green water weeds to eat. 
We named the fish. 
The father fish is Dick. 
The mother fish is Lassie. 
The little fish is Weewee. 
The other little fish is Weenee. 
The third lesson was a reading lesson. Hectographed copies of the 
story were distributed to the pupils. These were read and discussed by 
the pupils and finally entered into their books of reading lessons.1 
The point that is made clear by the foregoing reference and 
quotations is that suitable reading material for the pupils of 
the first grade is extensive rather than intensive and that it is to 
be derived from a variety of sources. 
Reading material should be abundant. The question arises, 
How is it possible to provide such a variety of reading mate- 
rial as is necessary to give sufficient practice in reading for 
meaning in a single primer and first reader? The answer is 
obvious. Children in the first year of school are obliged to read 
considerably more material than is provided within the con- 
fines of the ordinary primer and first reader. Successful teachers 
of first-grade reading find that their pupils are able to read with 
profit the stories in from three to six primers and four to eight 
first readers, and numerous stories in “supplementary readers” 
besides. This means that the majority of such stories are not 
“taught” by the teacher or “studied” by the pupils, but are 
read by the pupils for the pleasure they derive in their meaning 
reactions.

READING IN THE FIRST GRADE 2 Ly)

Summary of reading in the first grade. Three steps are 
necessary to be undertaken in teaching reading to beginners. 
They are (1) developing the content, (2) establishing relations 
between meaning and_symbol,-and—(3)—reading for _mean- 
ing. In, the third step pupils have difficulty in learning to 
read connectedly and fluently. Four suggestions are pertinent, 
as follows: 
‘x, The children should read selections which are easy and 
familiar. 
2, The children should read selections which are repetitive in 
form. 
3. The children should be instructed to engage in silent 
\ reading. 
4. The children should engage in oral reading, not for the 
sake of expression but for meaning’s sake. 
In the present chapter the importance of training in phonic 
| analysis and synthesis was emphasized. Informal training 
should be provided by insisting on correct pronunciation and 
clear articulation of words. Formal training should begin when 
the pupils have made the acquaintance of the printed symbols 
of a stock of easy, familiar words. Four steps in the training 
must be undertaken: 
1. The first step calls attention to known words arranged 
in a family, or sound, group. 
2. The second step analyzes words into their sound ele- 
ments, 
3. The third step recombines the sound elements into the 
original wholes. 
4. The fourth step recombines the sound elements into dif- 
ferent wholes. 
A second phase of the training in the mechanics of reading 
in the first grade was considered in connection with the discus- 
sion of the need and the principles of effective practice and 
drill. Descriptions of typical drill devices were quoted from a’ 
variety of sources. Finally, the importance of considerable 
 
-P-A-G-E-228
  
2 18 THE TEACHING OF READING 
practice in reading for meaning was emphasized, and the extent 
to which such practice should be carried was indicated. The 
conclusions from the latter phase of our discussion follow: 
1. In order to render automatic the mechanical features of 
the reading process it is necessary for the teacher to organize 
and to conduct correct, systematic, short, snappy, interesting, 
and varied drills. 
2. Pupils learn to read through much reading. Practice is 
just as essential in order to make proficient the interpretative 
phase of reading as it is in order to render automatic the 
mechanical phase.

CHAPTER XIII 
READING IN THE SECOND AND THIRD GRADES 
General principles reviewed. 1. The primary grades form 
the period most appropriate for mastering the mechanics of 
reading. 
2. Ability in the mechanics of reading may be developed at 
the expense of ability to get meaning. 
3. The ability to interpret depends for its development upon 
a coordinate development of ability in the mechanics. 
4. The two abilities are capable of codrdinate development. 
The development of both should be emphasized. 
5. Context is influential in determining meaning. Pupils 
need to be provided with an abundance of contextual material. 
- 6. Reading material must be easy and its content not diffi- 
cult to understand. 
7. The content of the reading material must appeal to the 
instinctive interests of the children. 
8. The training in mechanics should be such as to lead (1) to 
instantaneous recognition of words once learned and (2) to in- 
dependence in attacking new words. 
As a result of the instruction in reading in the first grade, 
as outlined in the two foregoing chapters, the children are able 
by the time they enter the second grade to read with a fair 
degree of independence the simple, interesting selections of 
their primers and first readers. They have learned to attach 
meanings to the words of which these selections are comprised. 
Moreover, they have acquired some ability in the recognition 
of new words. On the other hand, they are unable to recognize 
at sight many words which they hear daily in the conversations 
219 
   
-P-A-G-E-230
  220 THE TEACHING OF READING 
of their parents and friends and in the schoolroom, and they 
have not yet learned to read with a great deal of fluency, owing 
to the fact that they read a word at a time rather than in mean- 
ingful phrases. Instruction in the second grade must begin at 
the point where first-grade instruction has ceased. It must con- 
tinue in this and in the succeeding grade the work already be- 
gun in the first grade, gradually developing and perfecting the 
abilities necessary to a mastery of the mechanics of reading. 
Instruction in the second and third grades may be considered 
as a unit. The aim in each grade is the same: to lead the chil- 
dren gradually to a mastery of the mechanics. Throughout the 
two grades the aim is always to bridge the gap between the abili- 
ties which were started to develop in the first grade and the 
abilities that need to be perfected by the beginning of the inter- 
mediate grades. That is to say, reading in the second and third 
grades may be considered as a unit of work in that it aims to 
perfect the mechanical phase of the reading process, while read- 
ing in the first grade stands out by itself as a unit of work in 
that it aims to begin the reading process. 
Fluent oral reading is the goal of instruction. The discus- 
sions of the second part of this book have made clear what is 
meant by the mechanics of reading. They involve (1) the in- 
stantaneous recognition of the familiar words of a selection, 
(2) the ability to determine with independence and accuracy 
the somewhat unfamiliar words, and (3) the ability to put the 
words together with fluency into connected wholes. The first 
and second qualities are necessary to the third; indeed, they 
are a part of the third. To have mastered the mechanics of 
reading means, then, that one is able to read fluently and con- 
nectedly. The ability to read fluently is a partial statement at 
least of the goal of instruction in the second and third grades. 
A full statement would mention, also, the kind of reading that 
is suitable to these grades. 
Oral reading is the natural form of primary reading. It is 
closely related to the oral speech of the child, it provides an
-P-A-G-E-231
  
READING IN SECOND AND THIRD GRADES 221 
outlet for his meaning reactions during reading, and it serves to 
increase his power in the ready recognition of words. It does, 
however, tend to the development of lip-reading, which is so 
great a hindrance to both speed and comprehension in the 
silent reading of later life." Educators are therefore beginning 
to recommend work in silent reading, paralleling the training 
in oral reading, in the first three grades as well as in the upper 
grades. The aim of the work in these grades is to develop the 
fundamental habits and associations that are involved in fluent 
oral reading and to lay an enduring foundation for the silent 
reader of the upper grades. 
Mechanics must be closely related to interpretation. In the 
development of the fundamental habits and associations that 
are involved in fluent oral reading it is important for the teacher 
to bear in mind that this immediate, proximate goal of instruc- 
tion must hold its proper relation to the final goal of instruc- 
tion. The final goal is effective rapid silent reading. In the 
second and third grades the purpose is to train pupils to become 
fluent oral readers, not for the sake of the oral reading, but 
that they may develop eventually into effective rapid silent 
readers. That is to say, the fundamental habits and associa- 
tions involved in fluent oral reading must be thought of in 
connection with and as necessary to the development of the 
fundamental habits and associations involved in effective rapid 
silent reading. 
The matter may be stated in another way. The mechanics 
of reading is to be perfected in the second and third grades, 
not for the sake of the satisfaction the children may derive 
from the perfection of their mechanical skill, but in order that 
the children may become proficient in a process which, while 
it involves mechanical skill, is many times more useful and 
valuable than mere mechanical perfection ; namely, the process 
of reading for meaning.

222 THE TEACHING OF READING 
Preceding discussions have impressed us with the necessity 
of organizing our instruction in reading in such a way as to 
insure a mastery of the mechanics in the lower grades of the 
school so that the children of the intermediate and upper grades 
may be enabled to devote the whole of their attention to the 
highly important activity of reading for meaning. The de- 
pendence of ability in interpretation upon ability in the me- 
chanics has been referred to again and again. Moreover, what 
is still more important for our consideration is the danger, 
which has also been the burden of preceding discussions, that 
the mechanical phase and the interpretative phase of the read- 
ing process may not experience a codrdinate development, but 
that the former phase may develop at the expense of the latter. 
Teachers of reading in the second and third grades need fre- 
quently to remind themselves that mechanics must be empha- 
sized and developed in these grades in their proper relation to 
interpretation, else they will develop entirely apart from and 
at the expense of interpretation. Teachers need to be aware of 
the futility of expecting a codrdinate development of the two 
qualities if they are at all negligent in emphasizing both simul- 
taneously. Emphasis on the content of what is read, then, needs 
always to be a primary consideration, even at times when the 
development of mechanics is an important purpose of instruction. 
The problem of the teacher. The foregoing paragraphs in- 
dicate the problem of the teacher of reading in the second and 
third grades. It has been pointed out that the problem takes its 
character from the abilities pupils possess at the time they 
enter the second grade and the abilities they should have de- 
veloped by the time they leave the third grade. The teacher 
must build upon the work already begun in the first grade, or- 
ganizing the instruction in such a way as to develop the funda- 
mental habits and associations that are involved in fluent oral 
reading in their proper relation to the fundamental habits and 
associations that are necessary in reading for meaning. The 
following paragraphs suggest the extent of the teacher’s task:
-P-A-G-E-233
  
READING IN SECOND AND THIRD GRADES 223 
The fundamental purpose of reading is the acquisition of meanings 
or experiences from printed materials. All instruction in reading, there- 
fore, should place emphasis on the content of what is read. As was 
pointed out earlier in this section, however, a thorough mastery of the 
mechanics of reading is prerequisite to effective progress in the acquisi- 
tion of reading ability. Recent investigations have shown that the sec- 
ond and third grades form the most appropriate period for emphasizing 
this phase of reading instruction. The result which is desired by the 
end of the third grade is ability to read fluently and intelligently, either 
orally or silently, any material of ordinary difficulty. In the accomplish- 
ment of this result attention must be concentrated primarily on the 
content of what is read. If attention is directed too largely to the 
mechanics of reading, it is probable that reading will become a process 
of word-calling rather than of thought-getting. If attention is not 
directed to the content of what is read, the pupil will probably lose 
interest in reading and will not put forth that type of persistent effort 
which is prerequisite to rapid progress. 
By the time a pupil enters the second grade, he has learned to asso- 
ciate meanings to the words of simple selections, he has mastered a 
reading vocabulary of a few hundred words, he has gained some power 
in the recognition of new words, and he is able to read simple, inter- 
esting selections independently with a fair degree of success. On the 
other hand, he is unable to recognize at sight many words which he 
hears daily in the conversation of his parents and friends, he recognizes 
individual words rather than groups of words at each fixation of the 
eyes, and he is unable to read with a great deal of fluency. Further 
progress in reading is dependent on the development of additional skill 
in the recognition of unfamiliar words and greater fluency in the 
grouping of words. The major problems of the second and third grades 
relate, therefore, to the development of ability along three lines: 
namely, (@) comprehension, (b) rate and fluency, and (c) accuracy 
and independence. In order to secure effective progress along these 
lines pupils should be given frequent opportunity to read so that vari- 
ous habits which have been partially developed in the first grade will 
be more effectively established. Furthermore, it is necessary to intro- 
duce pupils gradually to selections of increasing difficulty in order that 
they may gain power in attacking increasingly difficult problems both 
from the standpoint of meaning and of pronunciation.

  224 THE TEACHING OF READING 
Comprehension, rate and fluency, and accuracy and inde- 
pendence are suggested as the three qualities to be emphasized 
in the second and third grades. The problem of the teacher, 
then, is to devise ways and means by which ability in these 
three qualities may be developed. Let us examine the methods 
and devices which apply to each in turn. Here we may separate 
the three types of ability for the sake of convenient discussion. 
The wise teacher will seek, however, to develop each, not as a 
separate and distinct ability, but as one closely related to the 
others and having its proper bearing on the development of what 
we designate by the general term as reading ability. 
Attention to meaning is necessary in order to secure meaning. 
It has been implied throughout our discussions of the nature of 
meaning that the mind is an active organized personality which 
responds to excitations from the outside world. Meaning has 
been explained as the product of the reactions, feelings, and 
attitudes of the mind toward the objects, actions, expressions, 
etc., and their corresponding symbols with which we are sur- 
rounded. The necessity of the action of the mind and of the 
attention of the mind in the apprehension of meaning has been 
impressed upon us again and again. It is important at this 
point in our discussion that we remind ourselves once more 
of the importance of securing and of directing attention if the 
school is to make progress in the improvement of its pupils in 
the ability to comprehend. 
In this connection we may recall the nature of the two kinds 
of attention, namely, forced attention and spontaneous atten- 
tion, with the fact that the latter is by far the more important 
and the kind to which the school should make its appeal. The 
problem of the school is to employ such devices and to provide 
such reading material as will make the greatest possible appeal 
to the spontaneous attention of its pupils—such devices and 
reading material as will force the children’s attention, in the 
sense of directing it, to the end that spontaneous attention will 
eventually be aroused. In considering how this problem may
-P-A-G-E-235
  READING IN SECOND AND THIRD GRADES 225 
be solved the following devices will be discussed: (1) technique 
of class instruction, (2) directed study, and (3) independent 
reading. 
Comprehension may be improved through class technique. 
The following third-grade reading lesson is reported as sug- 
gestive of the means of directing the attention of children to the 
meaning of a selection: 
The teacher began the class exercise by introducing the story of 
“King Tawny Mane,” as follows: 
There was once a lion whose name was Tawny Mane. He was so strong 
that all the other animals were afraid of him, and so he was called the king 
of the forest. He liked to kill every animal that came in his way, and there 
was no living thing in all the land that was safe from him. 
At last, one day, all the animals met to talk about their troubles, and see 
if they could not find some plan to save themselves from King Tawny Mane. 
They talked a long time, and then agreed what to do. 
In the evening they went together to the lion’s den. King Tawny Mane had 
just had a full meal, and so he did not try to harm any of them. “What do 
you want here ?” he roared. 
This frightened them very much. Some of them ran back into the thick 
woods. But the bravest stood still. “Speak, and tell me what you want,” 
said the king. 
Then Sharp Ears, the fox, stood up and spoke. . . . 
To make sure that all the children had caught the drift of the story 
thus far, the teacher asked: ‘‘Why were all the animals meeting at the 
den of King Tawny Mane?” ‘What do you think Sharp Ears, the 
fox, talked about when he spoke to the king?” From the answers given 
it was clear that the children understood that Sharp Ears told the king 
of the plan the animals had proposed to save themselves. A_ brief 
discussion ensued in which the children speculated concerning the prob- 
able plan Sharp Ears proposed. All agreed that the plan would have to 
satisfy the king by assuring him of a plentiful food supply. 
The teacher now passed to the class supplementary reading books, 
and the children were instructed to turn to the story and to find out 
what Sharp Ears said to the king and what plan he proposed. When 
these had been found out, each child was to close his book and signal 
to the teacher by raising his hand. Care was taken by the teacher that 
no child should read into the story greatly beyond the following passage: 
 
-P-A-G-E-236
  
226 THE TEACHING OF READING 
“O king,” he said, “we have come to see you about a very great matter. 
Do you know that if you keep on as you have begun, you will soon kill all 
the beasts in the forest ?” 
“And what if I do ?” said Tawny Mane. 
“Then what will become of you ?” said Sharp Ears. “What kind of king 
will you be when you have killed all your subjects ?” 
“But I must have something to eat,” said Tawny Mane. “I must have 
food.” 
“Yes,” said Sharp Ears, “and that is just what we have come to talk 
about. We have thought of a plan by which you shall have all the food you 
want without going out of doors to get it.” 
“That would be a good plan,” said Tawny Mane. “But tell me what it is.” 
“We will give you one animal every day,” said Sharp Ears. “We will draw 
lots, and the one upon whom the lot falls shall come to your den. You will 
not have to hunt at all.” 
“Good!” said the king. “We will try your plan and see how we like it.” 
For some time after this, things were very quiet in the forest. Every morn- 
ing one of the animals went down into Tawny Mane’s den, and never came 
out again. The lion liked the new plan quite well. 
Presently every child was ready with his answer to the question, 
“What plan did Sharp Ears propose?” Some of the more rapid ones 
had read into the story to include the following: 
At last the lot fell upon a little rabbit named Cotton Tail, and he was sent 
to make a call upon the king. He was in no hurry to go. He played along the 
road until after dinner time. Then, with big eyes and gentle steps, he went 
and stood at the lion’s door. 
King Tawny Mane was very hungry, and when he saw the rabbit he roared: 
“Why are you so late? Even the elephant knows better than to keep me 
waiting.” 
The rabbit bowed low and said: “I know I am late. But if you could 
only see what I have seen, you would not blame me.” 
One was allowed to open his book and read the extra paragraphs to 
the class. Discussion followed as to what Cotton Tail had seen on his 
way to the lion’s den. The hint was thrown in that Cotton Tail perhaps 
was scheming to escape from the dinner table of the king. The children 
were told to open their books and to find out what Cotton Tail had 
seen on the way. 
“What have you seen ?” said the lion. 
“T have seen something that may have a good deal to do with your keeping 
this kingdom,” said Cotton Tail.
-P-A-G-E-237
  READING IN SECOND AND THIRD GRADES 227 
“Tell me about it,” said the lion. He was always afraid that something 
would happen to'drive him out of his kingdom. 
“I canhot tell you,” said Cotton Tail, “but if you will come with me, I 
will show you what I saw.” Then he hopped away, and the lion followed 
him until they came to the mouth of an old well. At the bottom of the well 
was a little water, and under the water there was nothing but soft sand. 
“Just look in here,” said Cotton Tail. 
King Tawny Mane looked in. He thought he saw another lion at the bot- 
tom of the well. He showed his teeth; the other lion showed his teeth. “I 
am the king of the forest!” roared Tawny Mane. The other lion said nothing; 
but Tawny Mane thought that he roared. 
“J will show you that I am the king,” growled Tawny Mane. He was so 
angry that he did not know what to do. He jumped into the well, only to 
find that there was nothing but water and soft sand at the bottom. He could 
not get out. 
Then little Cotton Tail peeped down and called to the lion, “Tawny 
Mane,” he said, “your kingdom is at an end !” 
Little by little, Tawny Mane sank in the sand. In the evening Cotton Tail 
peeped down again. All was still... . 
Questions like the following were now asked: 
Was Tawny Mane a good king? What did the animals do about it? 
Who did the talking for the animals? What plan did Sharp Ears talk 
about? What did Tawny Mane think about the plan? Did he like it? 
Designated pupils were allowed to read the answers orally from the 
book, and such questions were continued until all had read. 
In the lesson just described the attention of the pupils was 
centered from first to last on the meaning of the selection. In 
their reading they looked for meaning, and the discussions 
showed that they found what they sought. It should be noted 
that the class discussions stopped short of entering into details. 
The discussions served to introduce the thought and to inspire 
the children to look for meaning. When meaning was secured, 
discussion was at an end. 
Comprehension may be improved through directed study. 
In this, the second, type of suggestion looking to the improve- 
ment of pupils in ability to comprehend, attention is directed 
to the meaning of a selection by means of questions and prob- 
lems which the pupils seek to answer and to solve. Interest is  
-P-A-G-E-238
  228 THE TEACHING OF READING 
centered not so much in the reading exercise as it is in the ques- 
tion or problem. The important point is that by such means 
pupils receive practice in looking for meaning as they read. 
A variety of devices may be employed. Questions may be 
written on the board and the pupils directed to find the answers 
to them, or the pupils may be directed to write questions con- 
cerning designated parts of a selection, or to write or to prepare 
to tell about the important and interesting points. At times the 
problem may be to prepare to dramatize the story. Frequently 
problems arise in other classes, and the pupils may be set to 
the task of solving them through reading. The following are 
illustrative : 
The second-grade class had been engaged in the study of Indian life. 
They had already grasped a fair idea of the manners, customs, and 
mode of living of the Indians, and were now busily engaged in modeling 
an Indian village in the sand table. Wigwams had been constructed, a 
lake for fishing with a pane of glass to represent the water had been 
provided close by, in the distance (at the far end of the table) was a 
forest of paper trees, and in between the forest and the village there 
was a field of corn represented by blades of grass stuck into the sand. 
Miniature figures of Indian men and women had been cut from paper 
and colored. With the placing of these figures in their proper places 
the children were now busying themselves. Indian men were placed by 
the lake to fish, and Indian men in the forest to do the hunting; but 
when it came to peopling the cornfield a dispute arose regarding the 
propriety of placing Indian men there. Some were certain that work 
in the cornfield ought to be performed by the men, while others were 
equally sure that Indian men did nothing but fight, hunt, and fish, and, 
therefore, had no time to work in the cornfield. Two or three were 
willing to compromise by placing both men and women in the field. 
The question was submitted to the teacher. The teacher did not decide 
the question, but directed the pupils to seek the answer through read- 
ing in their books about Indians. 
The third-grade class was engaged in the study of the lives and ad- 
ventures of the Vikings. To provide a basis for the class discussions, 
the teacher had assigned to various groups in the class the task of pre- 
paring oral reports on such stories from Jennie Hall’s “Viking Tales”
-P-A-G-E-239
  
  READING IN SECOND AND THIRD GRADES 229 
as the following: “The Story of the Tooth-Thrall” ; ‘‘How Olaf sought 
his Farm” ; “Olaf’s Fight with Havard” ; “The Story of Foes-fear,” etc. 
During the class discussions the children had frequently to return 
to the exercise of reading from their books for confirmation of the 
opinions and ideas they expressed in class. 
The foregoing examples illustrate how questions and prob- 
lems that arise in other classes may be used as bases of exer- 
cises and assignments in reading. 
Comprehension may be improved through independent read- 
ing. By far the most important type of device for the improve- 
ment of ability in comprehension, and the one least considered in 
schoolroom practice, is the third of our list; namely, independ- 
ent reading. Such reading is personal in character; its results 
are to the highest degree of the personal sort. It is the most 
natural kind of reading for the reason that it is undertaken 
through motives which are the least artificial. Reading of this 
sort does not permit the intrusion of any outside or artificial 
requirement between the printed page and the reader; neither 
does such reading keep uppermost in the reader’s attention a 
question to be answered or a problem to be solved. In its exer- 
cise schoolroom requirements do not intrude to interrupt the 
thought-getting process. Moreover, such reading is governed in 
the largest possible measure by the spontaneous attention of the 
reader, and it is undertaken more than any other kind for the 
sake of satisfying the cravings of one’s immediate and personal 
interests. 
Reading of the kind just described bears a very striking 
resemblance to one’s observation of a motion-picture play and 
its results. In the first place, one attends the motion-picture 
theater not for the sake of securing information which will 
help in answering a question or in solving a problem, but in 
order to spend a pleasant half-hour. When one has entered, the 
pictures appear before his eyes in rapid succession, and the 
story being portrayed gradually, but rapidly, unfolds. The me- 
chanical difficulties of following the movement of the play have
-P-A-G-E-240
  230 THE TEACHING OF READING 
been swept aside pretty largely by means of the most modern 
improvements on the cinematograph and through the technique 
of scenario writing and film production. The serious purposes 
of the outside world are shut out; no requirements to answer 
questions about the story, to tell or to write the story, or to 
prepare for a class discussion about the story intrude them- 
selves between the screen and the observer. The results of 
such observation are familiar. They are rich in reactions, feel- 
ings, and attitudes of mind. The observer is for the time car- 
ried away in fancy; in his imagination he is present in person 
at every scene. He actually experiences every action that is 
portrayed. 
It is the common experience of all who read these lines that 
one goes away from the witnessing of a motion-picture pro- 
. duction with his mind filled with information, sometimes with 
important ideas, perhaps with ideals of conduct, good or bad, 
and often with points of view on life and its affairs, also good 
or bad, such as he may never have had before. So it is with the 
independent reading of suitable selections which may profit- 
ably begin in the primary grades. The children approach such 
reading exercises, not to answer questions or to solve problems, 
but because of the inner drivings of their instinctive interest in 
entertaining stories. The school removes the mechanical diffi- 
culties which may attend by providing reading material which 
can be read easily and rapidly. The serious purposes of the 
outside world—of the classroom—are forgotten. On the wings 
of imagination the children are carried to other lands and other 
times; they experience every action and every scene portrayed 
on the pages before them; their minds are filled with meaning 
reactions. 
It is true that children in the lower grades of the school have 
to be given considerable formal instruction before they are 
able to undertake any large amount of independent reading. 
The requirement of formal instruction, however, does not in 
any degree detract from the value of this type of reading as
-P-A-G-E-241
    
READING IN SECOND AND THIRD GRADES 231 
practice in thought-getting. No reason has yet been found 
why children of the primary grades may not just as well read 
such stories as “Little Red Riding-hood,” “Jack the Giant 
Killer,” “Cinderella,” and dozens of others, rapidly outside of 
class, and get therefrom just as beneficial results in improve- 
ment in comprehension as it is possible to secure by mulling 
over them in long-drawn-out class discussions. Certain it is 
that by the former method the children will become acquainted 
with a wider range of stories and receive many times the 
amount of practice in reading for meaning. In this connection 
it is barely needful to repeat one of the general principles that 
were worked out in the second part of this book—namely, con- 
text is influential in determining meaning, and therefore chil- 
dren ought to be provided with an abundance of contextual 
material and (we may add) be permitted by means of inde- 
pendent reading to make use of as much contextual material 
as possible. 
The second problem of the teacher of the second and third 
grades is now before us; namely, that of devising ways and 
means by which ability in rate and fluency may develop. 
Rate and fluency of reading is not a separate ability. The 
discussion in the first part of this chapter shows that rate and 
fluency of reading ought not to be looked upon as an ability 
separate and distinct, but as one which should be closely re- 
lated in its development to the various other phases of reading 
ability. The causes of slow and laborious reading are sufficiently 
indicative of the close relationship to which we have just re- 
ferred. Slow and laborious reading may be due to one or all of 
the following causes: (1) inability to recognize words instan- 
taneously, (2) inability to group words and to read in mean- 
ingful phrase units,(and (3) inability to grasp the meaning of a 
selection easily. The statement of these causes emphasizes the 
fact that improvement is not made in the other phases of read- 
ing ability without a consequent development, or at least with- 
out a consequent opportunity for development, in rate and
-P-A-G-E-242
  232 THE TEACHING OF READING 
fluency. Improvement in rate and fluency follows the elimina- 
tion of the three causes just mentioned. The suggestions for 
their elimination are similar to the ones which will follow in 
our discussion of how to develop accuracy and independence 
and to those which have just been given under the heading of 
how comprehension may be improved. 
The first cause—inability to recognize words instantaneously 
—is a condition which results from the lack of familiarity with 
words. We may recall the word drills of the first grade as a 
means of increasing children’s acquaintance with words. The 
suggestions which relate to the development of accuracy and 
independence apply equally as well. 
The second cause—inability to group words and to read in 
meaningful phrase units—is a condition which results from the 
same lack of opportunity and training as that which results 
in the condition implied in the third—inability to grasp the 
meaning of a selection without difficulty. These conditions 
result because pupils are given only a limited opportunity for 
reading. Opportunity to read page after page instead of a sen- 
tence or two at a time must be provided if these conditions are 
to be overcome. 
Rate and fluency should not be emphasized as a distinct phase 
of instruction. It is well at this point to review the suggestions 
of the present chapter and of the two preceding ones, which 
bear upon the development of fluent reading and upon im- 
provement in reading for meaning. In Chapter XI are given 
the following suggestions bearing upon fluent connected reading : 
1. The children should read selections which are easy and 
familiar. 
2. The children should read selections which are repetitive 
in form. 
3. The children should be instructed to engage in silent 
reading. 
4. The children should engage in oral reading not for the 
sake of expression, but for meaning’s sake.
-P-A-G-E-243
  READING IN SECOND AND THIRD GRADES 233 
In Chapter XII practice in reading for meaning is empha- 
sized. The points are stressed that the content of primary 
reading should be varied and that the reading material should 
be abundant. 
In the present chapter we have the following suggestions for 
developing ability in comprehension: 
1. Comprehension may be developed through class technique. 
2. Comprehension may be developed through directed study. 
3. Comprehension may be developed through independent 
reading. 
Learning to read through much reading is the most impor- 
tant and most comprehensive of all the suggestions given, and 
the one implied in all our discussions. We need to remind our- 
selves of it again and again, not only here, because it bears 
upon the development of rate and fluency, but elsewhere in our 
discussions, because it lends itself to the improvement of every 
phase of reading ability. 
The suggestions bearing upon the development of fluent 
connected reading and of comprehension have been restated in 
this connection in order to impress once more the fact that im- 
provement in rate and fluency ought not to be emphasized as a 
separate undertaking, but in connection with—rather as a by- 
product of—the development of other phases of reading ability. 
The teacher may keep in mind the development of rate and 
fluency as a separate ability in order that it may not be neg- 
lected; but the undertaking should not be a separate one, for 
the reason that the danger is always present that the ability 
may develop at the expense of comprehension. 
The following paragraphs from the report of an effort to in- 
crease the reading rate of fourth-grade children are especially 
applicable to our present discussion. They repeat, and give 
emphasis to, the point of view the present chapter has been 
developing. 
These children must become vitally interested in reading. The desire 
to read must be made paramount before they will conscientiously under- 
   
-P-A-G-E-244
  234 THE TEACHING OF READING 
take the mastery of the mechanics of reading. To stimulate this desire, 
I worked with the children individually to find out their particular inter- 
ests. I pasted pictures on cardboard with a simple little story beneath. 
At some odd moment during the day a particular child would be called 
to me, to whom I would show the picture and ask the question, “What 
would you like to know about this picture?” After the child had 
responded, I would say, ‘‘Would you like to read this little story and 
find the answer for yourself?” Usually the child was willing to do so. 
At all times I helped with the hard parts. As soon as the child was able 
to read the selection as well as possible under the circumstances, the 
card was his own. 
Another method was this. I told part of a story and then referred 
the children to the reader to find the climax for themselves. 
Library books containing illustrations were frequently presented. If 
the child was sufficiently interested to attempt to find out what the 
pictures were about, he might have the book. The children were taken 
to the library and taught how to find books for themselves. . . . 
Eight children in this group were lip-movers.* I told them that I 
knew a secret about something that happens to some people’s lips 
when they are reading to themselves. I wouldn’t tell the secret; they 
must find out for themselves by watching their parents as they read the 
newspaper, and their schoolmates as they prepare their lessons. Very 
soon the secret leaked out. One small boy reported that he had seen 
an old man in the street car who moved his lips as he read a book. 
He illustrated the account, and the children immediately realized how 
foolish a lip-mover appears. Thereafter many a finger was pressed 
tightly over the lips to keep them in place. 
In working along the lines of word-grouping in the early stages, the 
simple device of having the pupils find nouns with their qualifying 
adjectives was employed. The children selected such groups as a 
“naughty, disobedient prince,” or “a very strange-looking house.” Then 
*Lip-movement has been quoted elsewhere in this discussion as one of the 
causes of slow speed. The point of view of the present writer is that lip- 
movement is but the outward manifestation of the inward difficulty of the 
poor reader,—a condition which usually accompanies slow reading, though 
not a cause of it. Accordingly, a consideration of lip-movement has not been 
given a place in our discussions. The reasons for its exclusion are the same as 
those which would justify the omitting of a detailed consideration of the 
diffuse and useless movements of tongue and feet from a study of methods of 
improving the handwriting of first-grade pupils.
-P-A-G-E-245
READING IN SECOND AND THIRD GRADES 235 
we selected phrases, such as “in the garden” and “by the sea.” These 
were combined into larger and larger groups. In the beginning, the chil- 
dren’s oral reading was disconnected and choppy. The results of this 
work appeared in a more natural rendition of the text... . 
In every instance, the reading rate has been accelerated and, with 
but one exception, the number of ideas [the pupils were able to repro- 
duce] increased. . . . 
The conclusions to be drawn are self-evident. Generally speaking, 
there has been an acceleration of both oral- and silent-reading rates of 
the entire class as well as a decided improvement in the number of 
ideas retained.t 
A final quotation may be included for the sake of lending 
further emphasis to the suggestions of the preceding pages. In 
his recommendations to the teachers of Indianapolis relative 
to the methods to be used in improving rate and fluency, Gray 
writes: 
One of the cities with which Indianapolis was compared secures ex- 
cellent results in this phase of reading instruction through quantitative 
sight reading. Daily exercises are conducted in which pupils read page 
after page without detailed comments or discussion. The reading is 
done at sight in connection with relatively easy selections concerning 
some problem in which the pupils are interested. At the time that one 
class was visited the pupils were working on the problem of how cotton 
is grown and marketed. The pupils in turn read long passages, com- 
menting occasionally on the significant points. Whenever it was needed, 
the teacher gave effective help on difficult words, but in a way which did 
not take the attention and interest from the main points of the story. 
A list was kept of the common words upon which help was needed, and 
at the close of the hour or in some special drill period these words were 
studied in detail. Such exercises bring the pupils in contact daily with 
pages of material and provide abundant opportunity for the associa- 
tion of symbol, meaning, and pronunciation. If these selections are 
wisely chosen, the pupils encounter relatively few difficulties at any one 
time. The results are that words which were partly familiar are fully 
mastered, groups of words are recognized at one fixation of the eyes, 
rate of reading increases, and oral expression improve noticeably.

Grade Class,” Elementary School Journal, December, 1920, pp.277-278, 279, 280. 
    
 
-P-A-G-E-246
  236 THE TEACHING OF READING 
In connection with quantitative reading exercises of the type de- 
scribed above, the pupils who were observed not only read the story, 
but they contributed many interesting, relevant facts which had been 
learned outside of the classroom. They brought in objects or materials 
which related to the problem at hand, and they told or read to the 
class interesting contributions which they had found in other books. 
At the end of the day they wrote significant sentences based on the 
reading of the hour, and at the end of the week they wrote short. 
stories which summarized their readings. Through the use of such 
methods, attention can be centered on the content of what is read, and 
permanent interest in reading can be developed, because the pupil dis- 
covers that he is rapidly mastering the process of reading and that he 
has reached a point in his development where he can secure interesting 
information and pleasure from his reading without great effort. Much 
oral reading once a day is recommended for second- and third-grade 
classes of Indianapolis. Attention should be centered primarily on the 
content of what is read, but the exercises should be so conducted that the 
habits and associations which are prerequisite to fluent reading have 
abundant opportunity to develop effectively.t 
From the foregoing suggestions which bear upon methods of 
improving comprehension and rate and fluency we turn now to 
a consideration of the ways and means of increasing the abil- 
ity of children in accuracy and independence. We shall keep in 
mind as we proceed that this phase of reading ability may de- 
velop in connection with the development of comprehension 
and rate and fluency, but will confine our discussion to a con- 
sideration of those suggestions which bear especially upon the 
improvement of accuracy and independence in the recognition 
of words. 
The phonic instruction of the first grade should be extended. 
A review of the first section of the discussion of the preceding 
chapter will recall to our minds the necessity and importance 
of phonic instruction in the first grade. The purpose of such 
instruction was there revealed as systematic mastery of the 
distractions offered by difficult words and improvement of the 
1W. S. Gray, “Reading in the Elementary Schools of Indianapolis,” Ele- 
mentary School Journal, March, 1919, pp. 525-527.
-P-A-G-E-247
  READING IN SECOND AND THIRD GRADES 237 
pupil’s power to recognize new words with accuracy and inde- 
pendence. Starting with known words the pupils of the first 
grade are led to an acquaintance with their constituent sound- 
elements and are given training in putting these elements to- 
gether to form new words. In beginning the discussion of the 
present chapter it was laid down as a guiding principle that the 
problem of the second and third grades is to extend and to 
improve upon the instruction of the first grade. Accordingly 
our first suggestion looking to improvement in accuracy and 
independence is that the phonic instruction of the first grade 
should be extended in the second and third grades. Such a sug- 
gestion contemplates that the elementary phases of phonic 
instruction will be departed from, to the end that greater re- 
sults in ability to recognize words will be attained. 
The children should learn to analyze words into syllables. 
The phonic instruction of the first grade, we remember, in- 
cludes the task of providing training in analyzing the very 
simple words of the children’s vocabulary into their sound- 
elements and in recombining these sound-elements to form new 
words. The training given is supposed to be so thorough as to 
insure the employment of phonic analysis and synthesis in the 
determination of the new words the children meet from day to 
day in their reading. It follows, then, that the first task of the 
second-grade teacher is to satisfy herself that the phonic in- 
struction of the first grade has been sufficiently thorough before 
proceeding to the more elaborate work of second-grade instruc- 
tion in word analysis. The teacher is now ready to extend the 
instruction in analysis of short words into their sound-elements 
to include analysis of long words into their syllable elements. 
To this end instruction is given in breaking up the longer and 
more difficult. words into their familiar parts and in putting 
these parts together in order to determine the original wholes. 
The following will illustrate the method: 
The children of the second-grade class had experienced considerable 
difficulty with the words grandmother, neighborhood, and carefully,
-P-A-G-E-248
238 THE TEACHING OF READING 
which occurred in one of their early reading lessons. The teacher had 
helped the children over these words and now undertook the task of 
showing them how they might determine such words for themselves. 
The teacher wrote the words on the board and had the children pro- 
nounce them. ‘How easy these words are, now that we know them, but 
do you remember how hard they seemed when you first read them a 
while ago?” The children recalled the difficulty they had had, and 
some volunteered to tell what they thought the words were at first. 
“These words are like all other words; when we don’t know them 
they seem hard, but when we know them they are easy.” The children 
were willing to recall words to illustrate this statement, but they were 
not encouraged to proceed far in the effort. ‘“‘Now,” said the teacher, 
“would you like to learn how to become friends with other words like 
these, so that they will always be easy and never seem hard? Let us 
see how we can make easy words out of hard ones.” 
The teacher now proceeded to divide the somewhat unfamiliar words 
into their familiar parts, pointing out the while each step of the divi- 
sion and securing as much help as possible from the children, as follows : 
grandmother became grand mother, grandmother; neighborhood be- 
came neigh weigh neigh bor, neighbor hood, neighborhood; carefully 
became care full y, careful ly, carefully. Enough repetition was had to 
insure a thorough understanding of every step of the process. 
The children should learn to attack new words boldly. One 
great difficulty that is to be observed in the reading work not 
only of the lower grades but of every grade of the school is the 
apparent timidity and uncertainty experienced by the children 
in attacking new words. In their reading work children form 
the habit of halting at a new or difficult word and waiting for 
help from the teacher, or from another pupil, in pronouncing it. 
When they do attempt to determine the word independently 
for themselves, they seem never to be certain of the results of 
their efforts. We have seen elsewhere in our discussion (Chapter 
VI) how such dependence of effort hinders the development of 
good reading habits. Accuracy and independence need to be 
developed. The second and third grades provide an excellent 
opportunity for checking the growth of habits of timidity and 
uncertainty by means of specific training in making bold at-  
-P-A-G-E-249

tacks on new words. The following continuation of the lesson 
which was reported in the preceding topic illustrates a method 
of training: 
In the drill period which followed the exercise with the words grand- 
mother, neighborhood, and carefully, the children were directed to look 
through their reading book and find as many hard words as they could. 
The following words were quickly pointed out by the pupils and written 
on the board by the teacher : 
farmhouse whichever handkerchief 
middle-sized flattered valuable 
woodland amusement remembered 
huntsman permission quicksilver 
The children now pronounced, both individually and in concert, the 
easy and familiar subdivisions of each word, as farm house, wood land, 
etc., and following the separate pronunciation of the parts of each word, 
they blended the parts and pronounced the word as a whole. With some 
words the teacher gave assistance; with others the children needed no 
prompting, but pronounced them independently of the teacher, and 
seemed to take pride in their accomplishment. 
On the following day the drill was continued with the same words, and 
a few new ones contributed by the teacher. The children now seemed 
to understand the process and to know what to do whenever they met a 
new and difficult word. The teacher repeatedly cautioned the children 
that it was necessary to stop to break up a word into its parts and 
pronounce the parts separately only when the word was hard and they 
could not tell what it was otherwise. 
In the assignment of a number of reading lessons which followed 
from time to time the teacher would indicate the difficult words and 
have the children determine their pronunciation. In nearly every case the 
teacher would suggest: “Now you know that word so well that you won’t 
have to stop while you are reading the story to find out what it is.” 
The foregoing illustrations point out the value of giving spe- 
cific training in the analysis of words and in attacking new 
words boldly. Importance of thorough training was emphasized, 
and at the same time it was made clear that the training should 
be stopped at the point beyond which it is no longer needed.

  240 THE TEACHING OF READING 
Summary. In the present chapter the work of the second 
and third grades is considered as a unit. Its purpose is to 
continue the training already begun in the first grade and grad- 
ually to lead the children to a mastery of the mechanics. The 
goal of instruction in these grades is fluent oral reading so 
taught and so emphasized as always to maintain its proper 
relation to the development of the habits and associations in- 
volved in effective rapid silent reading. Accordingly it was 
pointed out that the emphasis on mechanics in these grades 
must not divorce that phase of reading from the more impor- 
tant one of interpretation, but should be so directed as closely 
to relate the two phases of the process. The teacher’s task in 
the attainment of the purpose there set up was defined as that 
of selecting and making use of the devices and methods which 
lead to improvement in the following abilities; namely, 
(1) comprehension, (2) rate and fluency, and (3) accuracy and 
independence. 
The important suggestions which relate to the means of 
improvement in the three abilities follow: 
1. Comprehension may be improved through class technique. 
2. Comprehension may be improved through directed study. 
3. Comprehension may be improved through independent 
reading. 
4. Rate and fluency should not be emphasized as a separate 
phase of instruction. Improvement in rate and fluency should 
be sought in the improvement of the other phases of reading in 
order that the former phase may not develop at the expense of 
the latter phases. ; 
5. The children should learn to analyze words into sylla- 
bles. 
6. The children should learn to attack new words boldly. 
7. Children learn to read through much reading. Preceding 
discussions have introduced this point, the present chapter 
lends emphasis to it, and later discussions will return to it again 
and again.

READING IN SECOND AND THIRD GRADES 241 
Summary of suggestions relating to silent reading. The im- 
portant points of the present chapter relating to silent reading 
are as follows: 
1. The goal of instruction in the second and third grades— 
fluent oral reading—is to be thought of by the teacher in organ- 
izing her instruction as a necessary step in the formation of the 
habits and associations involved in effective rapid silent reading. 
2. Improvement in comprehension is the most important 
topic of the chapter; the most effective means of improving 
comprehension is independent reading, which is, necessarily, 
silent reading. 
The following suggestions, which are quoted editorially in the 
December, 1920, issue of the Elementary School Journal from 
the report of the Supervisors’ Round Table of Monmouth 
County, New Jersey, summarize very effectively a number of 
points discussed and implied in the present chapter: 
GRADE II 
With the foundation of the first year’s work drills for quickening 
the reading pace and securing more accurate thought-getting should be 
furnished. 
Assign longer selections for silent reading, two or three paragraphs. 
Test the results of this reading by oral questions, or by questions written 
on the blackboard to be read silently and answered orally. 
Use review stories. Teacher begins story anywhere. Child who finds 
place first stands and reads. 
See how far children can read in a given time, or how long it takes 
them to read a given selection. 
Whenever possible, directions and assignments should be written on 
the blackboard to be read silently. 
GRADE III 
Give setting in a few words, or propose a simple problem which the 
reading will solve. 
Sentences, paragraphs, and parts may be read in response to the 
teacher’s questions, aiming to get the essential facts of the whole unit.
-P-A-G-E-252
  242 THE TEACHING OF READING 
Give speed tests to ascertain how far pupils can read in a given time, 
keeping accurate records for future comparison. 
Reproduce to test thought-getting. 
Encourage the pupils to ask each other thought questions in silent- 
reading lesson. 
Write headings for paragraphs. (Simple outlining.) 
Train the pupil to select the essential facts in a selection read. Ask, 
“What parts must you remember to be able to tell the story? Read 
the selection again and notice what parts you may forget and still be 
able to tell the story.”

CHAPTER XIV 
READING IN THE INTERMEDIATE GRADES 
General principles reviewed. 1. In the intermediate grades 
pupils should have opportunity to engage in independent 
reading. 
2. The purpose of reading in these grades is to develop the 
ability to extract meanings from printed symbols. 
3. The meanings extracted from printed symbols are the sum 
total of the reader’s reactions, feelings, and attitudes toward 
them; what the reader brings to the printed page by way of 
knowledge and experience determines meaning quite as much 
as does the printed page itself. 
4. Context is influential in determining meaning. Pupils 
need to be provided with an abundance of contextual material. 
5. Reading material must be easy and its content not diffi- 
cult to understand. 
6. The content of the reading material must appeal to the 
instinctive interests of the children. 
7. Development of mechanics should be looked for in the 
constantly increasing power of pupils to read in meaningful 
phrases. 
By the time a pupil has completed the work of the primary 
grades he should be able to read fluently and connectedly the 
simple, interesting stories of his reading books and supplemen- 
tary readers. He should be able to secure with a high degree 
of perfection the meaning of such stories; and his rate of read- 
ing, silent as well as oral, should equal at least the ordinary 
speed of fluent, well-enunciated discourse. Moreover, the pupil 
should be able to determine new words with independence and 
243
-P-A-G-E-254
  244 | THE TEACHING OF READING 
precision and to recognize old familiar ones instantaneously 
and with a minimum of effort. In short, the work of the pri- 
mary grades should have led the pupil to a mastery of the 
mechanics of reading. 
With ability in the mechanics fairly developed, the pupil is 
now able to turn the whole of his attention in reading to the 
exercise of securing meaning; reading for meaning can now 
proceed unhampered by mechanical difficulties. At this point 
in its instruction the school is called upon to provide oppor- 
tunity and training in reading for meaning. We may secure an 
idea of the kind of opportunity and training to be provided by 
contrasting the former view of what constitutes good reading 
instruction in the intermediate grades with the view that is 
coming to prevail at the present time. 
The former view emphasized the continuation and enlarge- 
ment of primary methods. According to the traditional point 
of view the methods of teaching reading that have proved suc- 
cessful in the primary grades ought to be continued in the inter- 
mediate grades. To the teacher who holds to this point of view 
the later grades present no new problems for solution; the prob- 
lems of the earlier grades still remain, except that they present 
themselves now in an enlarged and intensified form. The ac- 
tivities of the primary grades are continued; phonic analysis, 
word drills, elaborate preparatory steps introducing the selec- 
tions to be read, long-drawn-out discussions following the read- 
ings, oral reading with close attention to pronunciation and 
emphasis—these and kindred activities are the order of the 
day. The only points of difference are that the subject matter 
has become more difficult, articulation and expression require- 
‘ments more exacting, and discussions more detailed and ana- 
lytical. Especially is it thought desirable to continue primary 
methods in instructing those pupils who have failed to make 
the required amount of progress in the primary grades and 
who, when they have arrived at the intermediate grades, are 
backward in reading. In handling such cases teachers as a rule
-P-A-G-E-255
    
READING IN THE INTERMEDIATE GRADES 245 
vainly attempt year after year to dispose of the difficulties by 
more and more liberal applications of the same methods that 
originally produced them. 
The present view emphasizes the importance of adopting 
different methods. In striking contrast with the traditional 
point of view relative to the methods best adapted to the read- 
ing of the intermediate grades is the point of view of an ever- 
increasing number of teachers at the present time. The reasons 
for the changing conception of the purpose and nature of in- 
struction in the intermediate grades have been put forward in 
previous discussions, in Chapter IX especially. Let us review 
them here. 
1. Primary pupils are able to pronounce words more rapidly 
than they are able to recognize them, while intermediate-grade 
pupils recognize more rapidly than they are able to pronounce. 
Consequently oral reading in the intermediate grades tends to 
retard the development of recognition. Conversely, 
2. In oral reading the eyes move ahead more rapidly than one 
can pronounce. Frequently they are so far ahead of the voice 
that words are mispronounced, even omitted, owing to the fact 
that vision and speech do not codperate. Consequently the de- 
velopment of recognition becomes an enemy of excellence in 
oral reading. 
3. The age of nine is a turning point in the life of the child. 
The intermediate-grade pupil has emerged from the period of 
social imitation and is now an individualist; he is more inde- 
pendent than the primary pupil in his desires, tastes, and habits 
of work. Not only so, but the instruction of the primary grades 
has made him capable of striking out for himself in the inde- 
pendent task of silent reading. Consequently, 
4. The pupil of the intermediate grades will not respond to 
the formal instruction of the primary grades. His interest is no 
longer in form, because the teacher so desires, but in getting 
meaning from his reading in satisfaction of his own individual 
~ desires and cravings. 
   
-P-A-G-E-256
  246 THE TEACHING OF READING 
The contrast that we have just noted between the former and 
the present view of what constitutes good reading instruction in 
the intermediate grades emphasizes anew the proposition that 
silent reading shall predominate in these grades and that the 
aim of instruction shall be to make easy and rapid the process 
of reading for meaning. Effective rapid silent reading is again 
impressed upon us as the important outcome of instruction. 
The materials and methods of instruction are to be such as will 
best lend themselves to the development of the ability of pupils 
to comprehend what they read. What these shall be we may 
determine by recalling the discussions of Chapter VII relative 
to the nature of meaning. 
Meaning is determined by habitual responses which grow 
out of experience. The discussions of Chapter VII have made 
clear that the meaning secured from the printed page is not to 
be explained by the mental imagery called up in the mind dur- 
ing the reading, but by the reactions, feelings, and attitudes of 
the reader to the words, sentences, and paragraphs as they 
appear in his consciousness. To this point there was added the 
important corollary that context is influential in determining 
meaning, and that it is necessary, therefore, that the reader be 
supplied with an abundance of contextual material. It is im- 
portant now that we reconsider and give added emphasis to the 
point that it is one’s own habitual mode of reacting that deter- 
mines meaning. A complete statement of this point would be: 
What the reader brings to the printed page by way of knowl- 
edge and experience determines meaning quite as much as does 
the printed page itself. 
For illustration let us consider one’s habitual response to the 
word “cat.” The response is the exact counterpart of the one 
that appears in the presence of the animal itself. It may be one 
of inward reaching out, of friendliness, or it may be one of 
inward withdrawal, of shrinking away, of fear. It is the out- 
‘growth of one’s first response in the presence of the animal, 
when friendly relations were first established or when one
-P-A-G-E-257
  READING IN THE INTERMEDIATE GRADES 247 
experienced some unpleasant consequence from the first meet- 
ing, and of a long line of pleasant experiences or unpleasant 
ones, as the case may be, which has ensued. In other words, 
one’s knowledge of the cat and his experiences in its presence 
determine his present relationship with the animal and, like- 
wise, his habitual mode of response in the presence of the word. 
Thus it is to be explained that the word “cat” has for different 
individuals two entirely different meanings—the one representa- 
tive of an animal to be friendly toward, to be petted, the other 
representative of an animal to be avoided and to be feared. 
In like manner one’s mode of reacting to all other words, to 
sentences, and to paragraphs is to be accounted for. One gets 
meaning—that is, he has reactions, feelings, and attitudes of 
mind—from the printed page, partly because of the arrange- 
ment of the words, sentences, and paragraphs on the page, but 
largely because of the habitual mode of response, which is the 
result of his knowledge and experience, that he brings to bear 
upon it. The more experience and knowledge one has as a 
background, the greater are the results in interpretation. 
Extensive silent reading is an important means of broadening 
experience. Thus far our present argument justifies the fol- 
lowing conclusions : 
1. That meaning is to be explained by one’s reactions, feel- 
ings, and attitudes; that is, one’s habitual mode of response. 
2. That one’s habitual mode of response has been built up 
through experience. 
3. That the secret of improving comprehension, therefore, is 
to enlarge and to broaden experience. 
To these our present topic adds a fourth; namely, 
4. That extensive silent reading is an important means of 
broadening experience. 
This topic does not require explanation or discussion here. 
It expresses the point of view of the whole book; it is a sum- 
mary statement of one of the central thoughts which Chap- 
ter II intends to convey; moreover, it will be returned to for 
   
-P-A-G-E-258
248 THE TEACHING OF READING 
further consideration in the chapter which immediately follows 
the present one. The topic is introduced here as a connect- 
ing link between conclusion 3, above, and conclusion 5, which 
follows : 
5. That extensive silent reading is the best possible means of 
improving the ability to comprehend. 
The problem of the teacher. We are now able to state the 
problem of the teacher of intermediate-grade reading. It is to 
broaden the experience of the children through extensive silent 
reading in order that their ability to secure meaning from the 
printed page may develop. Improvement of the ability to read 
through much reading suggests the kind of methods to be em- 
ployed. Selecting the largest possible amount and the right 
kinds of reading material and getting the children to read 
this material independently are the tasks which confront the 
teacher. Effective rapid silent reading is the goal of instruction. 
The statement of the goal of instruction seemingly confronts 
the teacher as a twofold problem: in the intermediate grades 
children must learn to engage in reading that is both effective 
and rapid. How to organize instruction so that rate as well as 
comprehension will improve appears to be a distinct problem 
which requires separate consideration and a solution of its own. 
Actually, however, no dual task faces the teacher because of 
the demand for improvement in rate. In a preceding chapter 
(Chapter VIII) the point was impressed that once the me- 
chanics of reading has been mastered, improvement in rate may 
be secured, not through the use of a special technique of in- 
struction but only by a gradual increase in the children’s power 
to read in larger and larger meaningful phrase units. Thus it 
becomes clear that in the intermediate grades the problem of 
improving rate of reading is in reality a problem of improving 
comprehension. The activities which lead to development of 
the ability to secure meaning react directly upon the reader’s 
rate by endowing him with an increase in the powers necessary 
to an increase in speed.
-P-A-G-E-259
  
READING IN THE INTERMEDIATE GRADES 249 
Main points of the discussion. The foregoing paragraphs 
have indicated for further consideration two important lines of 
activity as means by which ability in reading of intermediate- 
grade pupils may develop. These are (1) activities of the 
teacher and (2) activities of the pupils. Let us discuss in turn 
each type of activity: the first for the sake of enumerating a 
variety of methods and devices of class technique; the second 
in order to impress the importance of extensive independent 
reading. 
I, IMPROVEMENT THROUGH CLASS TECHNIQUE ; 
The point of view of the present discussion relative to the 
- importance of class technique as a means of improving ability 
in silent reading is implied in the following paragraph, which 
was quoted in Chapter II: 
So long has our profession taught that we think the only way to 
educate is to teach. We have not sufficiently known that to live will 
also educate. We have been busy providing the conditions for teaching. 
Only recently are we coming to know how to provide the conditions for 
living. Both have a place ; and the main thing is living.t 
In the following quotation the same viewpoint is expressed: 
In the third Nemean Ode of Pindar occurs an obscure passage which 
the English commentator Bury translates as follows: 
He whose knowledge is a lesson learned is a man in darkness, whose thought 
is as veering gale, and who never cometh to port with unerring course, but 
with ineffectual mind tasteth a thousand excellencies. 
For so many generations have teachers relied upon the “lesson 
learned” as the normal and ordinary procedure that lesson-assigning 
and lesson-getting have come to be pretty nearly synonymous with 
teaching and education in general in the mind, not only of the teacher, 
but of the general public aswell. To such an extent is this true that 
1Franklin Bobbitt, The Curriculum, p. 243. Houghton Mifflin Company, 
Boston, 1918.
-P-A-G-E-260
  
250 THE TEACHING OF READING 
even such praiseworthy innovations as the supervised-study movement 
have often tended to break down because they have merely tended to 
substitute one form of lesson-getting for another. Too often at that 
the new form of lesson-getting costs in training more than it gains in 
efficient learning. The nib of the whole supervised-study proposal is 
in the possibility it affords of substituting direct for indirect learning. 
Failing to make such a substitution, it often turns out to be only a 
partial success. 
The lesson-giving, getting, and hearing type of procedure is really 
based upon the assumption that learning a lesson is transferable to 
learning the thing the lesson stands for. If the pupil learns something 
about Latin and enough about it, the assumption is that he can eventu- 
ally read the thought of the Latin page. If he learns about the law of 
falling bodies, he will understand their behavior. If he can master a 
dozen pages in economics and stand cross-examination thereon, he will 
understand and can successfully react to the principles therein set forth. 
Such is the assumption, and, baldly stated, few could subscribe to it in 
theory, whatever their practice.t 
The implications of the foregoing quotations are (1) that 
there are ways of learning other than the ones provided by class 
instruction and (2) that an important purpose of class tech- 
nique is to encourage and to provide the materials for the 
learning process which must be carried on elsewhere. Let us 
consider them. 
Our viewpoint emphasizes silent reading as an individual 
matter. That there are ways of learning other than those pro- 
vided by class instruction is nowhere better illustrated than in 
the conception of the silent-reading process that is coming to 
prevail. Silent reading is an individual matter. The presence 
of one’s fellows in class and of the teacher is not a requirement 
of the process. Between the reader and the reading material 
external factors do not need to be interposed; indeed, the en- 
trance of external factors by way of questions, answers, discus- 
sions, directions, problems to be solved, projects to be performed,

direct Teaching,” School Review, January, 1921, p. 19. 
 
-P-A-G-E-261
    
READING IN THE INTERMEDIATE GRADES 251 
etc. not alone slows down the process but effectually prevents 
its performance. Silent reading is not a class exercise; any at- 
tempt to make it such destroys its very nature. It is not a proc- 
ess to be taught by the teacher; it is one that the pupil must 
learn through independent effort. 
The teacher may encourage, but cannot teach, silent reading. 
The efforts of many teachers to organize class instruction in 
silent reading contrast sharply with the views they express of 
the nature of the process. They freely admit in discussion, 
though they forget in practice, that silent reading is an indi- 
vidual matter and that it ought to be undertaken by the learner 
as an independent exercise; and they are impressed with the 
importance of ability in silent reading as an outcome of instruc- 
tion. And so, recognizing the importance of the process but 
failing to consider what it is like, they double their efforts to 
secure elaborate discussion of the content of reading selections, 
to analyze the selections into thought divisions, to ask ques- 
tions, to provoke answers, to have passages read silently in 
class,—in short, to conduct “silent reading” as a class exercise. 
When the. decision is reached to give additional emphasis to 
silent reading, many teachers seek to comply by increasing the 
length and the number of the class periods devoted to “silent 
reading” and by stipervising more closely the independent ef- 
forts of the pupils. Enthusiasm becomes so strong that no 
selection is permitted to be read except in preparation of a 
lesson that is to follow. Most elaborate reports,are demanded 
of the reading of the simplest selections. 
What is the result of such efforts to “teach” silent reading? 
Briefly stated, such efforts do not provide for silent reading in 
class, nor do they encourage the children to engage in silent 
reading outside of class. Consequently the children do not 
learn to read silently, and the elaborately organized programs 
of the teacher fail of their purpose. 
In order to be of service in improving the ability of children 
to read silently, class exercises should be organized not as a sub- 
 
-P-A-G-E-262
  252 THE TEACHING OF READING 
stitute for extensive independent reading, but as a means (1) 
of introducing new selections and stories to be read, (2) of 
checking the performance of the pupils and of recording the 
extent of their activities, (3) of establishing correct silent- 
reading habits, and (4) of stimulating the pupils to add to their 
efforts to read for meaning. The function of the teacher is 
to provide an abundance of suitable reading material, to in- 
troduce the children to this material, to encourage extensive 
reading, to provide suitable opportunities for independent read- 
ing during the school-day, and, finally, to keep the necessary 
check on the pupils’ performances for the sake of recording 
their progress from time to time and of being able to recom- 
mend, as time goes on, the reading of selections suitable to their 
developing abilities and needs. 
Silent reading is a process that cannot be taught; it must be 
learned through continued practice in actual silent reading ex- 
tending over a long period of time. Pupils learn to read through 
much reading. The teacher’s province is to encourage silent 
reading, not to try to ¢each it.* 
The following pages give a number of suggestions for organ- 
izing class instruction so as to encourage extensive independent 
silent reading. Reports of methods and devices actually em- 
ployed by successful teachers will be included. The sugges- 
tions and reports will be grouped in topics, as follows: 
1For the backward pupil the teacher must organize special exercises for 
improving eye-movements and eliminating articulation and lip-movements. 
Abundant exercises aiming to improve eye-movements and the span of recog- 
nition, to decrease lip-movements, and to secure quick, accurate responses to 
thought units will not only increase for the backward pupil the rate of reading 
and comprehension but will correspondingly stimulate within him an interest 
in silent reading. The best device for securing these results is a series of 
flash-card exercises which can be given under time pressure (such as the 
Horn-Shields Silent Reading Flash Card Exercises, Ginn and Company; see, 
also, Watkins’s “How to Teach Silent Reading,” Lippincott). These enable 
the teacher to diagnose individual reading difficulties and work for correction 
of faults, while they train the pupils to read for thought, increase interest and 
speed, and lessen lip-movements.

1. The class work should be carefully planned. 
2. A reading program should be provided. 
3. The class exercise should set problems to be solved through 
reading. 
4. The class exercise should encourage rapid reading for 
meaning. 
5. Oral reading should serve to encourage silent reading. 
6. The class exercise should introduce new reading material. 
7. Recording and crediting the out-of-class reading of the 
pupils should be a function of the class exercise. 
These topics we should keep in mind as statements of certain 
ways and means of encouraging children to learn to read 
through independent reading activities outside of class. Let 
us consider them. 
The class work should be carefully planned. The foregoing 
paragraphs have indicated two reasons why the class work in 
silent reading should be subject to careful planning. In the first 
place, there is the necessity of organizing the class work in such 
a way as to avoid the usual round of questions and answers, 
discussion and disputation, which seem to be carried on in the 
average classroom entirely for their own sake. Secondly, the 
importance of utilizing the class activities as a means of encour- 
aging independent silent reading out of class has been made the 
subject of explicit discussion. To accomplish properly the pur- 
poses of class instruction thus indicated the teacher must plan 
each recitation with care. The following “plan for a silent read- 
ing lesson” is introduced as illustrative of what the teacher may 
seek to accomplish through preliminary planning and prepara- 
tion. It is an excerpt from a quotation from the report of the 
Supervisors’ Round Table of Monmouth County, New Jersey. 
There is no intention in introducing it here to suggest its adop- 
tion as a fixed goal of endeavor in the preparation of every 
lesson. As a lesson plan it is somewhat formal and stereotyped, 
but as a suggestion of the possible aims of a class exercise it 
has its value.

  254 THE TEACHING OF READING 
PLAN FOR A SILENT-READING LESSON 
Grades 3-5 
The regular reading lesson should sometimes be a silent-reading lesson. 
Such a lesson should be chosen with reference to the type of response 
desired: 
Narrative—involving action and conversation—is most suitable. 
Exposition is good. 
Description not easy to handle. 
Children may answer orally or in writing. May illustrate by drawing 
or may dramatize. 
I. Teacher’s preparation. 
1. Thoroughly familiarize herself with selection. 
2. Look up all doubtful pronunciations and meanings. 
3. Prepare thought questions. 
II. Preparation with the pupils. 
1. Teacher gives a background or setting for story by discussing 
(a) author; (b) type of story; (c) illustrations. 
2. New words and groups presented (a) by phonetics ; (b) by com- 
parison; (c) by sight. 
III. Pupils read selection silently. 
1. Length of assignment depends upon the grade and difficulty of 
‘ selection. 
2. During the first reading pupils should grasp the selection as 
a whole. 
3. Re-reading may be directed to finding specific information, or 
selecting facts which relate to a problem under discussion. 
IV. Pupils explain difficult phrases in the text. 
x. Explanation of difficult phrases aims to (a) clarify ideas gained 
from silent reading ; (b) increase pupils’ vocabulary. 
V. Teacher and pupils ask thought questions which involve : 
. Grasp of the selection as a whole. 
. Careful character study. 
. Comparisons with previous reading experiences. 
. Use of judgment. 
. Word study. 
VI. Oral reading of parts of the selection may be given as proof for: 
1. Answers to thought questions.

VII. Pupils reproduce the selection. 
1. Written. 
2. Oral. 
3. Dramatization. 
4. Occupational projects based on reading, such as sand-table, etc. 
5. Pupils suggest original titles for the selection read.t 
A reading program should be provided. In like manner the 
teacher of intermediate-grade reading should work out a read- 
ing program which should state year by year the purpose of 
the class exercises and give a schedule of the important class 
activities to be planned for each year. Such a schedule of large 
aims and major activities is just as important a means of giving 
the class exercises their proper bearing on independent reading 
as are the detailed plans for the daily class recitations. The 
following reading program for the intermediate grades is 
suggestive : 
GRADE IV. 
Set a problem that reading will solve. 
Prepare questions stressing the essential facts of the whole unit. 
Determine the outline or plan of the story by finding the situations 
and naming them. 
Expect pupils to reproduce a selection concisely after the first 
reading. 
Make special assignments to different pupils to look up and report 
to the class. 
Give speed tests to determine the reading pace and ability to gain 
thought. 
Require the pupil to reproduce after a single reading what he con- 
siders the most important part in the selection read.

  256 THE TEACHING OF READING 
GRADE V 
The silent-reading lessons in the fifth grade should aim primarily to 
train the pupils to acquire good study habits, such as: Concentration by 
means of speed tests. The ability to distinguish between important and 
unimportant statements. Rapid reference reading. 
Have each child read a different book or story and prepare to read 
most interesting part to class. Require brief synopsis of the preceding 
and succeeding events. 
Assign different projects or topics in geography, history or English 
to be worked out by referring to the library. 
Encourage the pupils to read and discuss current events and to bring 
into the classroom clippings to prove their points. 
Read story or book and make written report. 
Pupils read and make thought-provoking questions to ask each other. 
Let the class co-operate in making an outline to include the important 
facts or events contained in a selection assigned for silent reading. 
GRADE VI 
The teacher should guide each step in the pupil’s work. The first 
essential to consider is the type of reading itself. This implies careful 
analysis, tabulation, and indexing of readers, grouping according to 
material, and so selecting the work that it will have a direct bearing 
upon the life of the child or correlate properly with his other work. 
In this grade children enjoy travel, biography, adventure, and fiction. 
Selections should comprise literary wholes. 
The chief needs of this grade are: (1) broadening of vocabulary ; 
(2) growth in appreciation ; (3) development of rapid reading ; (4) com- 
prehension. 
Skillful questioning by the teacher should emphasize and clarify un- 
common uses of familiar words, puzzling phrases, unfamiliar idioms. 
Growth in appreciation will increase in direct proportion to the skill- 
ful selection by the teacher of the material to be read. 
Frequent testings should be made for rate of reading and for com- 
prehension. 
The teacher should prepare outlines and questions tending to produce 
the gathering of sentence elements into thought units, and the recog- 
nition of their relations to each other. Practice along these lines will 
develop the habit of skimming a page quickly, at the same time grasp-
-P-A-G-E-267
  READING IN THE INTERMEDIATE GRADES 257 
ing the essentials of the page. In oral reading, this would permit the 
eye to run ahead of the voice, thus collecting the succeeding thought 
groups. In silent reading, it should produce rapidity.t 
Continuing the quotation, we have the following suggestions 
for the work of the seventh and eighth grades which apply 
equally as well to the work of the intermediate grades: 
GRADES VII AND VIII 
All sixth-grade suggestions apply here. 
The proper teaching of silent reading implies careful preparation on 
the part of. the teacher, analysis of the selection into scenes or situa- 
tions, recognition of a definite purpose in giving each selection for 
study, and skillful questioning or outlining of the selection, so that the 
pupil may be able (1) to gain from the questions the gist of the selec- 
tion, (2) to develop the same power of analysis in his own independent 
reading. 
The following outline may help to explain a good method for pupils 
to use: 
1. Read the selection through to gain the general idea. 
2. Into how many scenes (situations) does the selection naturally 
fall? 
3. Classify the selection—humorous, narrative, descriptive, etc. 
4. Read again, looking for unusual words, unusual groups, and so 
forth, using your dictionary where necessary. 
5. Name and describe the chief characters, points of interest, etc. 
6. Would you recommend the selection to a fellow-student? Why?? 
Teachers of reading should make their own programs, shaping 
them to fit the peculiar needs of their pupils. They may take 
the form of a schedule of aims and activities suitable for differ-

ent years, as illustrated in the quotations just given, or they 
may be worked out as a series of statements or recommenda- 
tions to govern in a general way the whole course of study in the 
subject. To illustrate the second type of program we quote at 
length from a series of recommendations which has been sug- 
gested by Professor Bobbitt. 
READING RECOMMENDATIONS FOR UPPER GRADES 
It is recommended : 
1. That the reading course be primarily designed to extend the 
thought and experience of the pupils to things beyond their immediate 
environment. 
2. That silent reading be the method usually employed for this 
purpose. : 
3. That the translation of the thought and experience obtained from 
reading into oral expression for the purpose of passing it on to others 
(that is, oral reading) be of secondary consideration. 
SILENT READING 
4. That the content of the reading be chosen so as to give the pupils 
width of vision over, and depth of insight into, all important fields of 
human affairs. 
5. That all reading done by pupils be taken into account in consider- 
ing their training in reading. 
6. That the reading side of all subjects be fully developed. 
7. That most reading be for the sake of having experience, and not 
for the purpose of learning things in the sense of memorizing facts. 
8. That the reading experience be adapted to the degree of maturity 
and the previous experience of the pupils. 
9. That those responsible for the reading content be fully conscious 
of the purposes to be served. 
to. That the content of the reading be chosen with definite relation, 
on the one hand, to the purposes to be served, and, on the other, to the 
characteristics of the children. 
11. That out-of-school reading be considered educative experience 
as fully as intra-school reading; that pupils be given credit for such
-P-A-G-E-269
  
  READING IN THE INTERMEDIATE GRADES 259 
reading; and that through the system of crediting and otherwise the 
outside reading be supervised by the schools. 
12. That pupils be trained in the technique of silent reading so as to 
secure effectiveness and economy in the maximum possible degree. 
13. That reading materials be so graded in degree of difficulty that 
the gradient is imperceptible. 
14. That there be an abundance of reading experience covering in a 
balanced way all important fields of human experience. 
15. That the quantity of reading material available be much greater 
than can be covered by any single pupil, however capable, in order to 
provide for all desirable types of personal tastes, desires, and appetites. 
16. That minimum essentials which are to be covered by all be 
selected upon a basis of common needs, and furnished in sets of books 
large enough to supply all pupils of a class at the same time, for the 
sake of administrative effectiveness and economy. 
17. That other sets of reading be chosen for special groups of pupils 
and supplied in sets large enough for these groups. 
18. That readings beyond these minimum essentials be supplied in 
library copies sufficiently numerous to meet the demand. 
19. That the children’s reading habits be developed in connection 
with four types of library: (1) the room-library, in charge of the class- 
room teacher; (2) the school or building library, in charge of building 
librarian, preferably a branch of the public library, and open certain 
hours in the week if not all the time; (3) the central public library ; 
(4) the libraries in the homes of the pupils. 
20. That reading be always motivated in ways of which the teacher 
is conscious: human interest in the story; use of reading for problem- 
solving ; getting information for pupil reports, etc. 
21. That the teachers have a conscious technique for intensifying the 
motive actuating the pupils, and for stimulating them to read sufficiently. 
22. That, as pupils grow sufficiently mature to understand, they be 
informed as to the various values and purposes of different types of 
reading ; that they be stimulated to make application of this knowledge 
in their reading choices ; and that in terms of this knowledge they be 
required to justify their choices. 
23. That, in connection with their reading, pupils be trained to make 
sufficient and normal use of reference helps, dictionary, atlas, gazetteer, 
handbook of literary reference, etc. : 
24. That reading selections be used for reading experience, not for lit- 
erary analysis, and not as things to be learned, recited, and examined upon.
-P-A-G-E-270
  
260 THE TEACHING OF READING 
25. That discussion, class work, etc., in connection with reading, be 
for intensifying, extending, and socializing the reading experience. 
26. That the books in their mechanical make-up be adapted to the 
pupil’s needs: clear print of proper size ; proper length of line; proper 
spacing of lines; paper surface free from glare; no visual confusion 
due to “print showing through”; etc. 
27. That attention be given to the proper posture of the pupils in 
their silent reading. 
28. That for the sake of speed in silent reading the following condi- 
tions be observed : 
- a. Reading be strictly silent, not semi-articulatory. 
b. Reading materials to be easy so that pupils can take in the thought 
rapidly and without hesitation. 
c. Reading to be copious in quantity from the first grade onward. 
d. Pupils to read straight ahead in the first reading of anything 
without interruption of any kind. 
e. Flash-cards or their equivalent to be used in the intermediate 
grades for increasing the attention span. . . .* 
The class exercise should set problems to be solved through 
treading. Although the round of questions and answers, reports 
and discussions, of the ordinary class exercise may not bear 
directly upon the process of reading for meaning, as was pointed 
out in foregoing paragraphs, yet it is possible and highly im- 
portant for these activities to be organized so as to encourage 
independent reading for meaning both in and out of class. Ques- 
tions may be asked, not for the sake of securing immediate 
answers, but for the sake of encouraging the children to look 
for answers in further reading. Reports may be had, not so 
much for the sake of testing reading that has been done as for 
the sake of enlarging the common interest in certain topics as 
a prelude to further reading. Discussions may be conducted in 
order to provide a desire for further information as well as to 
organize and to assimilate information already acquired. Class 
debates on disputed points are often found to be highly effec-

tive in arousing interest in selections to be read. Pupils may 
be expected to secure meaning the more readily from the selec- 
tions they read if they undertake the process looking for cer- 
tain meanings, the clues to which they already have in mind. 
Questions, reports, discussions, debates, may be utilized to 
provide such clues. 
For example, children may be assigned to read certain parts 
of “Some Merry Adventures of Robin Hood” in order to deter- 
mine if Robin Hood should have been pardoned; they may 
read “Black Beauty” to find out the number of things Black 
Beauty had to become accustomed to in order to be a well- 
trained horse; they may read the story of the ‘Prodigal Son” 
to select the passages which illustrate the father’s love; they 
may set themselves to the task of reading the ‘Man Without 
a Country” in order to prove that Nolan loved his country 
dearly. The following quotation further illustrates the point: 
One lesson in particular belonged to a series of information lessons 
concerning Holland. The teacher had secured a large number of appro- 
priate books on Holland. The teacher and class discussed the problem 
and selected a list of topics which should be developed. Each pupil 
chose a topic from this list and made it the basis of his study. He 
read carefully but rapidly all of the references which he could find relat- 
ing to his topic. Pictures were secured, illustrative materials of various 
topics were collected, and the body of fact secured through his reading 
was organized in good form. Each pupil reported to his classmates the 
results of his investigation. Wherever necessary certain important ref- 
erences were read to the class. This method of procedure speaks for 
itself. It is highly recommended in place of some of the unprofitable 
exercises discussed in connection with oral reading in the intermediate 
grades.? 
It is clear that in exercises of this type the interest is not in 
the reading exercise, but in the problem to be solved, the ques- 
tion to be answered, the meaning to be sought. Such exercises

are valuable in that they “provide for the enlargement of ‘ex- 
perience, give ample opportunity for extensive reading, con- 
centrate attention effectively on the content of what is read, 
and train in the careful selection and organization of subject 
matter.” 
The class exercise should encourage rapid reading for mean- 
ing. Closely akin to the class exercises which lead in an indirect 
way to improvement in reading for meaning are those which 
seek to improve this quality by means which are more immedi- 
ate and direct. Such exercises provide for the process of reading 
to be carried on as an essential feature of the class work. The 
following paragraph describes the method: 
. .. The pupils read the paragraph rapidly and silently and then 
are questioned as to their comprehension of the thought. It is a method 
of enforcing rapid reading ; of analyzing the essential ideas within the 
paragraph; of marshaling these ideas so that the pupil may have the 
information available. In certain classes there was observed an excep- 
tionally superior method of testing the group’s comprehension of the 
paragraph by means of certain types of problem-study rather than 
through simple reproduction. This type of drill appears to have a 
proper place in any well-organized plan of training pupils in methods 
of study. They need to be rather thoroughly drilled in this rapid com- 
prehension and organization of the material in a paragraph. . . 2 
Such is the common conception of a “silent-reading exer- 
cise.” A somewhat more effective silent-reading exercise, and 
at the same time one that is unique and productive of abun- 
dant enthusiasm and interest, is reported as follows: 
MarerraL: “How I Killed a Bear” by Charles Dudley Warner. 
Purpose: 1. To improve comprehension and increase rate. 
2. To assist in the appreciation of the humor. 
ProstEM: To plan a motion-picture based upon this story. 
PRocEDURE: 1. Statement of problem.

  READING IN THE INTERMEDIATE GRADES 263 
We see a great many moving pictures with many different plots. 
Where do you suppose the motion-picture director gets the stories for 
all the pictures he must produce? One pupil answered that people 
write them and another soon suggested that they take some from books. 
We are going to read a story this morning called “How I Killed a 
Bear” that I believe could be worked into an interesting motion picture. 
For the next half-hour let us forget that we are pupils of the Gardenville 
School and let us be motion-picture directors. Let us read through this 
story from the standpoint of a director and decide what scenes we will 
include and in what order. 
2. Solution of the problem. 
We will read ahead until we have decided upon the opening scene. 
The children set to work with a will, each one hoping to be the first 
to discover the opening scene. In a short time some one suggested it, 
adding graphic suggestions as to the arrangement of the stage and the 
action of the characters. All agreed to this and set to work to find the 
next scene. Here a difference of opinion arose. Some pupils wanted to 
include the account of the hero’s previous experiences with a gun, but 
others objected on the score that this did not properly belong to the 
action ‘How I Killed a Bear.” Some asked, “Well, suppose you do 
include it, how are you going to connect it with the story?” This ob- 
jection was quickly answered by a wide-awake boy who responded 
at once, “Don’t they often show what people are thinking about in 
motion pictures? All you would have to do would be to have him hold 
his gun and look at it as though he were thinking and then show these 
things.” Here the teacher stepped in. “Before we can decide what to 
include in our picture I believe it will be necessary to decide whether 
the picture is to be exciting, funny, sad, or romantic.” The name of the 
story suggested that it was exciting to some, while others, influenced by 
the humorous account of the hero’s past experience with a gun as just 
read, insisted that it would have to be funny. The teacher suggested 
that the class read on before deciding. 
The humorous account of a colored cook’s encounter with a bear was 
read by the children with general amusement, as they were now on the 
lookout for humor. One member of the class who had insisted that this 
would make a good humorous picture, fearing that those on the oppo- 
site side would miss the point of the account, spontaneously arose and 
read aloud as soon as he discovered it, “He did not know whether she 
 
-P-A-G-E-274
  264 THE TEACHING OF READING 
would agree with him.” At this point all agreed that the picture was to be 
humorous. Then if our picture is to be humorous, what kind of inci- 
dents must we be sure to include? ‘‘ Funny,” the pupils replied in chorus. 
As the pupils went on to discuss each scene, even such minute detail 
as the “glad surprise” of the bear was appreciated. The pupils decided 
that they would have to have a well-trained bear, for if he failed to look 
glad, the audience would lose one laugh. They decided to include what 
the man was thinking when the bear came toward him, for it would 
certainly add humor. They explained that the scene in which the hero 
relates his experience to his home folks would have to be liberally in- 
terspersed with leaders, for the humor lay in the swift repartee. Then 
came a heated discussion as to the closing scene. Some wished to stop 
with the procession carrying the bear homeward, others with the crowd 
who assembled to view it, others with the hero just dropping off to 
sleep with “the last delicious thought,” “I have killed a bear.” This 
last suggestion was finally agreed upon, for the pupils decided that if it 
were presented skillfully it could be made very funny. 
The advantages to be derived from such a device as the one 
here described are thus reported: 
The writer observed a part of this recitation and was struck with the 
enthusiasm and interest with which the pupils read and discussed. This 
is a fine example of the study-recitation type of silent reading, which 
should be used occasionally for the purpose of observing the pupils’ 
silent-reading habits and for the purpose of developing better study 
habits. However, most of the silent-reading lessons should be of the 
type requiring definite study preparation in connection with problems 
set by the teacher or conceived by the pupils. This particular recitation 
"is especially good in several respects. The method involved keeping con- 
stantly in mind the large view of the selection and at the same time a 
close scrutiny of the details in relation to the main problem. The pupils 
were learning how to select, compare, judge, exclude, appropriate, put to- 
gether, and draw conclusions. It forced the slow readers to become more 
alert, concentrate better, and increase their rate of reading. The discus- 
sion helped them to keep the connection, to see their lack of thought- 
getting, and provided a motive for renewed effort. It resulted in keen 
appreciation of the characteristic elements of this unit of literature.”

  READING IN THE INTERMEDIATE GRADES 265 
Oral reading should serveto encourage silent reading. Earlier 
discussions of this book have justified the organization of oral- 
reading exercises in certain grades on the grounds that they 
prepare for and assist in the development of some of the funda- 
mental habits and associations involved in effective rapid silent 
reading. Moreover, it has been argued with marked insistence 
that such exercises should cease at the point where they begin 
to lose connection with the ultimate end sought in reading in- 
struction, which is, generally speaking, at the beginning of the 
intermediate grades. The point has never been made, however, 
that a limited amount of oral reading may not be included as a 
necessary and important phase of the silent-reading class exer- 
cises. The fact that oral reading, at the proper times and in 
proper amounts, may be the means of encouraging further 
silent reading for thought we shall not lose from sight. Let us 
consider some suggestions, based on the experience and practice 
of skillful and successful teachers, which are pertinent to the 
oral-reading phase of the class exercises : 
1. The members of a class may be encouraged to read pas- 
sages in support of a judgment they are defending. The reader 
necessarily emphasizes the meaning phase in his reading; his 
hearers have certain phases of meaning called to their attention. 
2. The pupils may be assigned the task of finding especially 
interesting, exciting, dramatic, or humorous passages in the 
articles they are reading silently and of preparing to read these 
orally in class. The preparation directs their attention to mean- 
ing; the oral reading may tend to encourage other members of 
the class to read the articles from which the passages were taken. 
3. In content subjects, such as history, geography, nature 
study, and hygiene, the pupils may read clippings from news- 
papers and magazines and selections from books which are not 
accessible to all the class but which throw light on the topics 
under discussion. 
4. Special “outside-reading” days may be arranged from 
time to time in which the pupils read interesting passages from 
 
-P-A-G-E-276
  
266 THE TEACHING OF READING 
books that they have been reading independently. Others in 
the class are introduced to these books and may be encouraged 
to read them. 
5. The teacher may occasionally read aloud for the pupils. 
The pupils unconsciously acquire ideals of good oral reading; 
at the same time they may be encouraged to undertake the read- 
ing of the same or similar stories and articles for themselves. 
The class exercise should introduce new reading material. 
The foregoing suggestions about oral reading illustrate how the 
performance of the children may be made the means of intro- 
ducing each other to new reading material, and suggest a device 
the teacher may employ for the purpose. Other devices and 
means should be employed as occasion permits in order to 
take advantage of this most important function of the class 
exercises. The mere mentioning of new reading material will 
sometimes secure the desired results, as “Here is a story in 
St. Nicholas telling of George Washington as an expert horse- 
man,” or, “This story is one of exciting adventure in the World 
War,” or “This is about hunting wild animals in the jungles 
of Africa.” Another effective means is to suggest the reading of 
certain articles and books by certain members of the class, 
This method was employed at the beginning of the year with a, 
sixth-grade class under the writer’s observation. At the end of 
three weeks thirty-three pupils had read eighty-seven new 
library books, and the more rapid readers were hurrying the 
slower ones so that an exchange of books could be effected at 
the earliest possible moment. Some teachers organize the class 
exercise once each week into a “library period” in which the 
merits of certain books are discussed by the pupils who have 
read them and the interesting features of new books are pointed 
out by the teacher. During this period the pupils return the 
books they have been reading, and others are assigned and 
charged to them. 
Recording and crediting the out-of-class reading of the pupils 
should be a function of the class exercise. Recording and credit-
-P-A-G-E-277
  READING IN THE INTERMEDIATE GRADES 267 
ing the out-of-class reading of the pupils are important tasks 
of the teacher for the following reasons: (1) A constant check 
on the pupils’ reading activities is permitted. Whether the 
pupils are following or slighting the teacher’s suggestions and 
assignments becomes thereby a matter of record. (2) The prog- 
ress being made in silent reading by the various members of the 
class is brought to the attention of the teacher. Moreover, a 
record of the kinds of reading already done by a pupil is the 
best possible guide in determining what kinds he shall under- 
take next. (3) A comparative cumulative record of perform- 
ance acts as a stimulus to all who are taking part. The slower 
readers are encouraged to read the articles and books that 
are listed as read under the names of a large number of their 
classmates, while the more rapid readers are encouraged to 
read still more in order to merit continued recognition as 
wide readers. 
On page 268 is a description of a device made use of by a 
number of teachers and found to be effective: A large sheet of 
paper is ruled in cross section, and the names of the pupils and 
the names of the books being read are written in the spaces 
provided for them, as shown in the accompanying diagram. 
A sheet is provided that is wide enough to accommodate the 
names of all the pupils and long enough to contain the names 
of all the books that will probably be read during the year. 
When a book has been read its title is written in the first 
column, as shown, and a check (\/) is placed under the name 
of the pupil who has read it. As others read the book checks 
are placed under their names. The record is posted in a 
conspicuous place in the room, and each week it is brought 
up to date. The record is given a prominent place in school 
exhibits, and favorable mention is made of it whenever occa- 
sion permits. 
Summary. The problem of the teacher of reading in the 
intermediate grades is fundamentally different from that of the 
teacher of reading in the primary grades. In the primary grades
-P-A-G-E-278
  268 THE TEACHING OF READING 
the purpose of instruction is to lead to a mastery of the me- 
chanics; in the intermediate grades the purpose is to broaden 
experience through extensive silent reading, the idea being that 
the more of experience the child brings to bear upon his reading 
material, the greater are the results in interpretation. In the 
intermediate grades the child learns to read; that is, improves 
in reading through much reading. Consequently the problem of 
the teacher becomes one of selecting the largest possible amount 
of suitable reading material for the pupils and of getting them 
to read this material silently and for meaning.

The present chapter points out that improvement in silent 
reading does not result directly from class instruction, but 
directly from the independent exercise of silent reading. Silent 
reading is something to be learned, not something to be taught ; 
proficiency in silent reading results primarily from the activi- 
ties of the pupils, not from the activities of the teacher. But in 
order that the proper pupil-activities in silent reading may be 
carried on with the greatest possible enthusiasm, economy, and 
dispatch, the teacher finds it necessary to organize certain class 
exercises which are to serve as means of encouragement and 
direction.

READING IN THE INTERMEDIATE GRADES 269, 
The present chapter concludes with a discussion of a number’ fs 
of suggestions for organizing class instruction to encourage 
extensive independent reading. They are as follows: 
1. The class work should be carefully planned. 
2. A reading program should be provided. 
3. The class exercise should set problems to be solved 
through reading. 
4. The class exercise should encourage rapid reading for 
meaning. : 
5. Oral reading should serve to encourage silent reading. 
6. The class exercise should introduce new reading material. 
7. Recording and crediting the out-of-class reading of the 
pupils should be a function of the class exercise. 
The chapter which follows will conclude the discussion of 
reading in the intermediate grades by pointing out how im- 
provement may be secured through independent reading.

CHAPTER XV 
READING IN THE INTERMEDIATE GRADES (Continvep) 
Il. IMPROVEMENT THROUGH INDEPENDENT READING 
The preceding chapter indicated two important lines of ac- 
tivity to be considered in undertaking the task of organizing 
instruction in reading in the intermediate grades; namely, ac- 
tivities of the teacher and activities of the pupils. The first 
type of activity has been discussed under the heading “Improve- 
ment through Class Technique.” Its importance as a means of 
encouraging independent reading was made clear, and a num- 
ber of methods and devices of class technique were introduced. 
We now arrive at the second main point of our discussion, 
“Improvement through Independent Reading.” This we may 
discuss from three very closely related points of view; namely, 
(1) the nature of independent reading, (2) independent read- 
ing as a means of broadening experience, and (3) independent 
reading as a means of education. 
The present chapter necessarily takes upon itself the nature 
of a review and of an elaboration of points already discussed. 
In this connection we should review the topic improvement of 
comprehension through independent reading in Chapter XIII 
and the introductory paragraphs of the topic on class technique 
in Chapter XIV in order to locate the following points, which 
provide the basis of our present discussion: (1) independent 
reading is silent reading; (2) it is individual reading; (3) it is 
easy, rapid, and interesting; (4) it is varied; (5) it is free from 
external requirements. Let us review each of these in turn. 
Independent reading is silent reading. The facts which estab- 
lish this point have been impressed upon us again and again. 
270
-P-A-G-E-281
READING IN THE INTERMEDIATE GRADES 271 
The characteristics of silent reading and of independent read- 
ing are the same. Both are individual and personal; both 
should be easy, rapid, interesting, and varied; both are free 
from external requirements; both are undertaken because of 
individual, personal interests in the easy and rapid, free and un- 
interrupted assimilation of information about the varied phases 
of life and of its affairs and activities and conditions. Freed of 
its machinery of form and of all external requirements, and un- 
dertaken in order to gratify immediate personal interests, read- 
ing is necessarily both independent and silent—silent because it 
is independent, and independent because it is silent. 
Independent reading is individual reading. The truth of this 
point is impressed upon the observer of ordinary reading prac- 
tice in the intermediate grades. There the point is made im- 
pressive by contrast. Following ordinary practice the teacher 
insists that all pupils read from the same book. When one reads 
in class the rest must follow closely. When a lesson is assigned 
precautions are frequently taken in order to prevent the more 
rapid pupils from reading beyond bounds. The idea that dif- 
ferent groups in the class may be reading different topics or 
chapters seems not to occur to the teacher, while the idea of 
each pupil reading a different book independently of class and 
teacher is looked upon, if it ever occurs, as a passing vagary 
of the wildest imagination. Reading under circumstances such 
as these is not individual reading, and it possesses none of the 
characteristics of independent reading. It is not independent, 
because it is not individual. 
A wide difference in practice is to be observed in the school- 
room where independent reading is encouraged and where it 
is the rule and not the exception. Here an entirely different 
point of view prevails. The pupils read the articles and books 
suggested by the teacher, not for the sake of meeting a class 
requirement, but because their interests have been aroused in 
certain deeds of valor, in certain exciting experiences, in the 
habits of certain animals, in the modes of living of certain 
 
-P-A-G-E-282
  272 THE TEACHING OF READING 
peoples, in the lives of certain great men and women, in certain 
important discoveries and inventions, and they are seeking to 
satisfy these interests through reading. During the periods 
set aside for reading and during out-of-school hours the pupils 
may each be reading a different book : while one is reading “Tom 
Sawyer,” another reads “Treasure Island,” another “Captains 
Courageous,” another the “Log of Tom Drake,” another the 
“Life of Roosevelt,” another “Old Stories of the East,” and so 
on. One for the time is interested in romance and adventure, 
another in a particular biography, another in popular mechanics, 
and yet another in the most recent athletic news. Each pos- 
sesses interests which are individual and personal; each is 
guided by individual desires and cravings; the reading done is 
necessarily individual reading, and being individual it is inde- 
pendent reading. 
Independent reading is easy, rapid, and interesting. The 
present topic is closely related to two of the general principles 
which were worked out in an earlier section of this book. They 
are (1) reading material must be easy and its content not diffi- 
cult to understand, and (2) the content of the reading material 
must appeal to the instinctive interests of the children. Our 
present discussion adds to the argument for a wider adoption 
of these principles. 
Independent reading is necessarily easy, rapid, and interest- 
ing. If the reading is otherwise, it will not be undertaken spon- 
taneously by the children; it will have to be forced upon them. 
It will be undertaken to meet certain class requirements, not 
to satisfy the individual interests and desires and cravings of 
the pupils. Independent reading is individual reading, and to 
be individual the reading must not be such as to discourage 
independent effort in undertaking it. 
The distinction between “reading” and “study” needs to be 
kept in mind. Pupils will study—and it is important that they 
be required frequently to study—material that is neither easy, 
rapid, nor immediately interesting. This is perfectly in accord
-P-A-G-E-283
  
READING IN THE INTERMEDIATE GRADES 273 
with the demands of certain subjects that are to be learned, and 
does not disagree in any wise with the requirement for the 
development of more and more effective habits of concentrated 
application to the work of the school. But reading is not study. 
Reading is getting the meaning easily and rapidly from printed 
material, and the content of the printed material must appeal 
to immediate interests. Reading is mechanically easy, and both 
easy and rapid, because of the presence in the reading material 
of interesting and appealing content. 
Independent reading is varied reading. In order to appeal to 
the instinctive interests of the children, the reading material 
provided for them must be as varied as their interests. This 
means that the reading material must be as varied as life itself, 
for the reason that normal children of the intermediate grades 
are curious about life and nature in all their mutations and 
diverse conditions and aspects. Their most striking character- 
istic is their desire to know. Their attention is drawn to all 
sorts of information so long as the information is in a form 
that favors ready understanding and assimilation. They will 
turn to reading in order to satisfy their curiosity and for 
answers to their multitude of heterogeneous questions. 
Suitable reading material for the intermediate grades is, 
therefore, not exclusively of romance; not altogether literary, 
historical, geographical, or semiscientific ; it cannot possess any 
one special feature to the exclusion of others. To be suitable 
it must be varied. It must abound in fiction; in narrative 
poetry; in stories from history, from geography, and from 
nature; in stores of romance, of adventure, of animals and of 
people, and of discovery and invention—in short, in stories 
from life in all its ramifications. 
Independent reading is free from external requirements. In 
independent reading nothing comes between the reader and the 
printed page. The requirement of certain facts to be learned, 
of certain passages to be memorized, of certain questions to be 
answered or problems to be solved, does not distract the reader.
-P-A-G-E-284
  
274 THE TEACHING OF READING 
The reading is done for its own sake, not to meet the require- 
ments of future recitation or discussion. Of course it is entirely 
proper on certain occasions for independent reading to be fol- 
lowed by recitation and discussion. The point is that while the 
independent reading is going on no thought is given to such 
requirements. Immediate interest which the reading itself fos- 
ters is the motive back of the process. It is the only require- 
ment that independent reading can possibly meet. 
Furthermore, reading to. be independent must be free from 
all machinery of form that may make itself apparent to the 
reader. The presence of mechanical difficulties, such as new 
and difficult words and unfamiliar mythological and historical 
allusions in too great quantities, detracts from the immediate, 
personal interest, slows down the reading process, renders the 
reading too difficult, and changes the process from one of read- 
ing to one of study. The necessity of turning aside frequently 
from one’s reading in order to seek the meaning of unfamiliar 
terms in a dictionary or glossary marks the reading material 
as too difficult for the reader, and the reader not yet prepared 
to engage in independent reading of material of this sort. Such 
material may be quite appropriate as regards every other char- 
acteristic; the fact that it is too difficult to be interpreted 
except by interruption of the reading process and a turning to 
outside sources of information renders it inappropriate for 
independent reading at this particular stage in the reader’s 
development. At some later time it can be read with ease. It 
will then be appropriate for independent reading. 
External requirements have thus been considered (1) as re- 
quirements imposed by persons other than the reader himself 
and (2) as requirements imposed by the difficulties of the 
reading material. The presence of either class of external re- 
quirement during the reading of a selection is a means of dis- 
traction, and to the extent that the reader is distracted from the 
interests that inhere in the reading material itself he engages 
in reading that is not independent.
-P-A-G-E-285
  READING IN THE INTERMEDIATE GRADES 275 
Summary of characteristics. The foregoing discussions have 
characterized independent reading in five different ways, as 
follows: 
1. Independent reading is silent reading. 
2. It is individual reading. 
3. It is easy, rapid, and interesting. 
4. It is varied. 
5. It is free from external requirements. 
We turn now to an examination of independent reading from 
our second point of view; namely, independent reading as a 
means of broadening experience. 
Experience is broadened through actual experiencing. This 
is something more than a catch phrase; it is a fundamental 
principle of learning and teaching. In order to understand its 
significance let us return for a time to the discussion of Chap- 
ter II. The second main division of Chapter II impressed the 
following truths which are pertinent here: (1) Primitive man - 
learned through personal observation and experience. He ob- 
served and experienced life in his narrow world in all its various 
phases and conditions. His methods of learning was experi- 
ential; his means were his organs of sense. (2) The method of 
learning at the present time can be no different from that of 
former times. As the savage experienced in order to learn, so 
must we experience if we would learn. (3) Our world is not 
narrow like that of the savage; it is as broad as life is now and 
as it ever was in the past. Our world includes both things of 
the present and things of the past. (4) Therefore the means 
of observation and experience used by the savage fail us. We 
can experience but few things of the present and nothing of 
the past by means of the organs of sense. Though the method 
of the savage cannot be improved upon, his means must be sup- 
plemented. (5) The means to be relied upon today in order to 
experience is independent reading. 
We do well to return to a consideration of primitive methods 
and means of learning and to examine them side by side with  
-P-A-G-E-286
  276 THE TEACHING OF READING 
those that prevail at the present. The savage traveled to all 
parts of his narrow world and observed events and conditions 
and things through his eyes of sense. Experience taught him 
what he knew. Today it is impossible for one actually to travel 
to all parts of our broad world of affairs and actually to observe 
all phases of life through his eyes of sense. But if we would 
be educated, we must travel to all parts of our broad world of 
affairs, both of the present and of the past, and observe life in 
all its phases. Experience must be our teacher, as it was the 
teacher of the savage. Only our means of travel and of observa- 
tion are different. Today one is permitted to travel everywhere, 
even back into centuries that are past, on the wings of his 
imagination and to observe everything that happens or has 
happened through the eyes of written language—through inde- 
pendent reading. 
Independent reading is experiencing. The experiential char- 
acter of independent reading has been pointed out in previous 
discussions. When one reads independently he is for the time 
carried away in fancy. He is present in imagination at every 
scene portrayed, he takes part in every activity, he witnesses 
every movement of the story, and he is embodied in every 
character. Their actions and words are his own, he feels as 
they feel, and he is influenced for the moment by the same con- 
ditions, desires, and motives as they. Independent reading is 
by no means word-for-word memorization ; it is actual experi- 
encing in its broadest sense. It opens the gateway to the present 
that is beyond our immediate environment and also to the past ; 
it is the means by which we are permitted to broaden our 
experience through actual, though imagined, experiencing. 
Let us proceed now to a consideration of independent read- 
ing from our third point of view; namely, independent reading 
as a means of education. 
The pupil learns through his own self-activity. Our present 
interest in this principle of learning is determined by the defini- 
tions we shall accept of education and of the educated man.
-P-A-G-E-287
  
READING IN THE INTERMEDIATE GRADES 277 
Education, let us say, is the result of training, and, in another 
sense, the training itself; while the educated man is one who 
has had training and as a result is able to engage in the same 
activities, both physical and mental, as the ones he had to 
perform during the training period, and in similar activities. 
Education is the result, in the form of powers and abilities and 
capacities, of the activities of the individual himself. Whether 
the education is skill in performing a physical act or ability to 
carry forward constructive thinking, the individual must him- 
self have performed similar activities in order to have learned ; 
that is, to have become educated. Intelligent practice we shall 
consider the prerequisite of education. 
Education, then, in the sense of being able to carry forward 
constructive thinking results from the individual’s own activi- 
ties in constructive thinking; that is, in drawing conclusions, 
in reasoning, in solving problems. It is clear that one may read 
and get meaning from the printed page without engaging at all 
in thinking that is constructive. Reading for meaning is not 
necessarily drawing conclusions, or reasoning, or problem- 
solving. Consequently, if we would look upon independent 
reading as a means of education, as we have set out to do, we 
must consider, first, the general nature of constructive mental 
activities and, next, how independent reading aids in encourag- 
ing and in carrying forward such performances. 
Constructive thinking is initiated by individual questioning. 
Thus far our discussion has covered the following points: 
(1) that education of the mind is the result of participation in 
mental activities and (2) that the mental activities indulged in 
must be the individual’s own. We now proceed to trace the 
connection between independent reading and the exercise and 
development of one’s mental powers. As a first step let us con- 
sider how independent reading helps to initiate the mental 
activities involved in reasoning, or problem-solving. 
In order to engage in the individual mental exercise of 
reasoning about a problem and trying to find a solution, there
-P-A-G-E-288
  
278 THE TEACHING OF READING 
must be in the individual’s own mind a question to be answered 
or a problem to be solved. A question asked by another does 
not necessarily become a question for one to think about and 
to answer. A problem presented by another may be of no con- 
cern to one for the reason that to him it is not a problem to be 
solved. He is not concerned with the solution, because he fails 
to see and to understand the conditions which govern the 
problem. For example, Einstein’s theory of relativity does not 
arouse in our minds any profound thought; we do not worry 
ourselves trying to arrive at an explanation of the fourth di- 
mension; and we are not particularly concerned about the 
newly discovered method of measuring the angular diameter 
of the stars. These are questions and problems for the scientist. 
Not being our own problems; not having arisen in our own 
minds; not having occurred to us except as questions asked by 
others, they are not problems in so far as we are concerned, 
and they are not capable of fostering in us any constructive 
thinking. We should be perfectly clear in our own thinking, 
before we attempt to follow the discussion further, that in 
order to be able to begin the process of reasoning out an answer 
to a question or of seeking the solution of a problem, a person 
must have in his own mind a question to be answered or a prob- 
lem to be solved. We should be perfectly clear on the point that 
the first step in constructive thinking about any subject lies in 
finding questions about it to be answered and in discovering 
problems in it to be solved. 
Individual questioning is initiated by acquired information. 
It is the common conception that the sequence of situations 
that are involved in constructive thinking is, first, the problem 
and, next, acquiring information to be used in solving the prob- 
lem. The ideas seem to prevail that the getting of information 
necessarily comes last, and that a problem presented by an- 
other, or a question asked, necessarily becomes a subject of 
inquiry in an individual’s mind. The fact is, as it was pointed 
out in the preceding topic, that something must go on in the
-P-A-G-E-289
  READING IN THE INTERMEDIATE GRADES 279 
individual’s own mind before a problem is a problem to him. 
The sequence accordingly is, first, the acquired information; 
next, the problem; and, finally, acquiring and organizing in- 
formation in solving the problem. It is always true that in- 
terest in a problem is a strong motive for seeking information 
about it. It is likewise true that the problem in the mind results 
from information already there. 
Strictly speaking, therefore, problems arise out of situations 
which confront the individual, information about the situa- 
tions being the necessary prerequisite of the problem arising; 
problems are discovered in situations, the point being that the 
individual must be engaged in contemplation of the various 
phases of the situation before and at the time the problem is 
discovered ; problems are, in a word, peculiarities of situations 
which are to be seen only as the situations are learned about 
by the individual. The acquiring of information must always 
precede the discovery of problems. The following paragraph, 
which relates to the origin of problems, may be helpful: 
. it is desirable to get in mind the idea . . . that a problem in- 
volves both a certain intellectual and a certain emotional condition in 
the thinker; a problem is a question involving doubt. Consequently, 
for our purposes, a problem is not merely a topic, as it often appears 
to be in some courses of study, nor is it merely a question. It is a type 
of mental condition in the pupil, a condition in which he is possessed 
of a question plus doubt. The more doubtful, uncertain, and perplexed 
he is the more intense is his problematic frame of mind. Creating such 
a state of mind in the pupils, consequently, is the starting-point of 
problem-solving activity. Several words to describe this initial frame 
of mind have been brought together by Professor John Dewey, our 
leading authority on reflective thinking, in his excellent book entitled 
How We Think. In one place (p. 12) he says, “The origin of thinking is 
in some perplexity, confusion or doubt.” Again (on page 74) he speaks 
of “something unexpected, queer, strange, funny (i.e., odd) or discon- 
certing” as furnishing the starting-point for reflective inquiry. Finally 
(on page 9) under the heading “tthe importance of uncertainty,” he 
speaks of a “genuine problem” as existing in “whatever—no matter
-P-A-G-E-290
  280 THE TEACHING OF READING 
how slight and commonplace in character—perplexes and challenges the 
mind so that it makes belief at all uncertain.”+ 
It is clear that the situations that initiate thinking possess 
for an individual the requisite characteristics of “something 
unexpected, queer, strange, funny (that is, odd), or disconcert- 
ing” only to the extent that his acquired information about 
these situations permit him to have an insight into their “‘unex- 
pected, queer, strange, funny, or disconcerting” features. It is 
clear that acquired information in the mind arouses in the indi- 
vidual the mental condition of “perplexity, confusion or doubt” 
which is the origin of thinking. 
Independent reading is an important means of acquiring in- 
formation. We set out to consider in what way independent 
reading is a means of education. Thus far our argument has 
been as follows: (1) education results from the individual’s 
own activities in constructive thinking; (2) constructive think- 
ing, considered up to this point as reasoning or problem-solving, 
is initiated by individual questioning—that is, by the discovery 
of problems; (3) individual questioning is initiated by ac- 
quired information—that is, problems are discovered in situa- 
tions with which the individual is somewhat familiar. We have 
only to review the important facts which were brought out in 
our discussion of the nature of independent reading in order to 
find the answer to the question before us. 
Independent reading is undertaken because of individual in- 
terest in life in all its various phases and conditions; it is easy 
and rapid; and it is not hindered by external or mechanical 
requirements. A lot of reading is done. The more the individ- 
ual reads, the more he wants to read and the better prepared he 
is to read. Independent reading is a means of acquiring infor- 
mation; this leads to a broadening of personal interests, and 
this leads to the acquiring of more information. Experience is 
broadened through reading.

  READING IN THE INTERMEDIATE GRADES 281 
Our conclusion is clear. Independent reading is a means of 
acquiring information. This encourages a questioning attitude 
which leads to the discovery of problems, and this in turn ini- 
tiates the educative activities of constructive thinking. 
Let us consider next how independent reading aids in the 
educative activities of constructive thinking when thought of 
as the drawing of conclusions or as generalizing. 
Generalization progresses as information is acquired. In 
order to pass in review before us the characteristic features of 
the process of generalizing, it will be necessary for us to think 
of the mind not as a mere storehouse of facts that we have 
learned, or of bits of information that we have acquired, but 
rather as a sensitive personality upon which facts and bits of 
information leave their impress and then go their way. The 
mind is to be considered not merely as a filing cabinet in which 
facts are stored in orderly array, nor as an encyclopedia in 
which bits of information are collected and annotated and 
made ready for instant reference; it is to be thought of rather as 
a plastic substance which is molded and shaped and imprinted 
and marked by its contacts with the conditions and situations 
of the outside world. We learn a thing today and we may forget 
it tomorrow, but forever our thinking is characterized by the 
extent and depth of its impression. We learn of a situation, a 
happening, a proposition, or an event in complete detail, and 
straightway we cease to remember nine tenths of the details 
that are involved; but the mental reaction, the feeling, the 
attitude of mind which results stays with us always as a condi- 
tioning factor in our future thinking. Acquiring information in 
the sense of memorization of facts is not learning; learning is 
to be thought of rather as acquiring information in the sense 
of examining facts for the sake of their influence on our ability 
to discern, to appreciate, to feel, to conclude, and to generalize. 
A generalization is to be thought of as being something 
broader and more inclusive than a conclusion or an inference. 
For example, it is possible for one to arrive at a conclusion, to
-P-A-G-E-292
  282 THE TEACHING OF READING 
draw an inference,—not always the correct one, however,— 
from a single fact about a situation; whereas, in order to form 
a generalization, or a general concept, one must have examined 
all the facts which relate to the situation. A generalization may 
be defined as the common element in a whole series of related 
facts—common to all, and, therefore, general and not particu- 
lar. It is, to be sure, a conclusion, but one that has been shaped 
and modified and defined by the characteristics and influences 
and limitations, not of a single fact by itself, but of all the facts 
which belong to the group. Arriving at simple conclusions and 
drawing commonplace inferences from single facts by them- 
selves does not require the exercise of a high type of mental 
activity ; whereas the ability to generalize—to see the common 
element in a whole series of related facts—is representative of 
mental activity of the highest sort. It is essential to have not 
only familiarity with all the facts concerned but also the ability 
to understand the relationship between them and to see the 
element common to each. The former essential is a matter of 
acquiring information, while the latter is a matter of training 
and practice. For our purposes we need to bear in mind that 
the former essential—acquiring information—is the prerequisite 
of the latter. 
A generalization is not always a consciously formulated gen- 
eral conclusion. It does not appear always in a carefully for- 
mulated statement. Not infrequently it takes shape in the 
thinking of an individual as a general attitude or feeling or point 
of view which has unconsciously and progressively developed 
as he has gathered information. The facts one by one and the 
bits of information that are pertinent enter his mind, and they 
may leave it. They may all be forgotten in time, but the gener- 
alization remains. The details may be lost, but their common 
impressions have gradually grown up into the individual’s atti- 
tudes and feelings and points of view. 
Independent reading is a starting point in constructive think- 
ing. Here, as in the topic just preceding, we are able to under-
-P-A-G-E-293
  READING IN THE INTERMEDIATE GRADES 283 
stand the importance of independent reading as a means of 
education. Independent reading is an important activity be- 
cause it is a most effective means of acquiring interesting in- 
formation. Interesting information, we have seen, is useful for 
generalization in two ways: (1) asit is being acquired, general- 
ization unconsciously and progressively develops; (2) when it 
has been acquired, conscious generalization may proceed. 
Conscious generalization, problem-solving, reasoning, and 
conclusion-drawing are kindred activities; rather, like activi- 
ties considered from different points of view. They each re- 
quire a fund of information in the mind as working material 
and as a motive force behind the activity. Acquired informa- 
tion initiates constructive thinking, which is mental exercise, 
or mental training, and the prerequisite of education. As one of 
the most important means provided by the school for the ac- 
quiring of information, independent reading is to be looked 
upon as a-means of education. 
Summary. This will conclude our discussion of reading in the 
intermediate grades. In the preceding chapter it was pointed 
out that the purpose of instruction in these grades is to lead to 
a broadening of experience through extensive silent reading. 
The bearing upon improvement in ability to read was there 
indicated. In the first place, the reader improves in compre- 
hension only as he gets in possession of larger and larger funds 
of information and experience and becomes more and more 
skillful in bringing these to bear upon the process of interpreta- 
tion. Secondly, he improves in rate, granted that the mechanics 
of reading have been mastered in earlier grades, in proportion 
to the increase in his ability to get meaning; that is, as he be- 
comes able to read in larger and larger meaningful phrase units. 
The chapter concluded with a discussion of a number of class 
devices that are useful in encouraging independent reading. 
The theme of the present chapter has been the nature and 
importance of independent reading. The following points were 
discussed: (1) the five characteristics of independent read-  
-P-A-G-E-294

  284 THE TEACHING OF READING 
ing, (2) independent reading as a means of broadening ex- 
perience, and (3) independent reading as a means of education. 
Throughout the discussion special stress was brought to bear 
upon the point that the important purpose of schooling in the 
intermediate grades is to fill the minds of the pupils with large 
amounts of useful and interesting information in order that 
they may be led to discover problems in the various situations 
of life and thus be prepared to engage in the important activi- 
ties involved in constructive thinking.

CHAPTER XVI 
READING IN THE UPPER GRADES 
The problem of upper-grade reading is determined by the 
character of lower-grade instruction. By the time a pupil has 
completed the work in reading of the intermediate grades, as it 
has been outlined in the two chapters just preceding, he should 
be able to read with ease and a high degree of understanding 
any material of ordinary difficulty. Through much practice he 
ought by this time to have acquired definitely fixed habits of 
silent reading. Moreover, when he emerges from the inter- 
mediate grades, he should have a broad fund of information 
about the concrete experiences of life, both past and present, a 
discriminating taste for the best literature that is explanatory 
of such life experiences and suited to his age and attainment, 
and the ability to use books in the acquirement of any sort of 
information which may at any time be of interest to him or the 
subject of definite inquiry and discussion. In short, the pupil 
should enter the uppér grades with a mastery, in the broadest 
sense of the term, of reading as a tool of learning. The extent of 
such mastery determines the character of the instruction in‘ 
reading best suited to his needs. 
The situation described in the foregoing paragraph with 
reference to the ability of upper-grade pupils to read is, of 
course, the ideal one. An approximation to this ideal, however, 
should be expected as the outcome of instruction in the lower 
grades. Each grade has a definite task to perform. Upon the 
successful performance of the task assigned depends the organi- 
zation of the work in succeeding grades. The whole discussion 
of this book is based upon the belief that definite progress shall 
285 
 
-P-A-G-E-296
  286 THE TEACHING OF READING 
be provided in the instruction that is planned for the various 
grades. For example, the purpose of the instruction in reading 
in the primary grades is mainly to lead the pupils to a mastery 
of the mechanics, and thus to enable them to make use of the 
art independently as a means of gathering interesting infor- 
mation in satisfaction of their individual desires and cravings. 
The supposition that this purpose will be accomplished by the 
end of the third year of schooling provides the basis for the 
organization of instruction in the intermediate grades. Like- 
wise, the supposition that the instruction and practice provided 
in the intermediate grades lead to a mastery of reading as a 
tool of learning is the basic idea for the organization of the 
course of instruction in the upper grades. 
That every teacher recognizes the necessity of organizing 
special kinds of instruction for retarded and backward pupils 
is an admission *that not“every pupil is able to complete the 
work of his grade on schedule time. The discussion of this spe- 
cial problem of the teacher—that of giving special help to back- 
ward pupils—we reserve for a later chapter. In the present 
chapter we shall consider the problem of organizing reading 
instruction for normal children of the upper grades who have 
already acquired a mastery of the reading process as a tool of 
learning. ‘ 
The purpose of upper-grade reading is to improve upon the 
instruction of the lower grades. The concluding discussion of 
the preceding chapter provides the clue to the solution of our 
present problem. There it was pointed out that independent 
reading is a means of education for the reason that through its 
use the individual acquires a mass of interesting information 
which may lead to the discovery of problems and finally to the 
mental exercise involved in constructive thinking. The im- 
portance of constructive thinking, or the mental effort to solve 
a problem, as.a motive for acquiring new information was men- 
tioned.in passing. Here is to be found the nib of our entire 
discussion of reading in the upper grades. It lies in the distinc- 
 
-P-A-G-E-297
  READING IN THE UPPER GRADES 287 
tion that we should make between reading as a process merely 
of acquiring information before a problem is in the mind and 
reading as a process of collecting data in the effort to solve a 
problem that has entered the mind. If there exists no differ- 
ence, it will be impossible to organize instruction in the upper 
grades that will improve upon the instruction of the lower 
grades; upper-grade instruction will be nothing more than a 
continuation of what has gone before. But if a difference can 
be shown, then the evidence will be at hand that will make 
clear the path that upper-grade instruction is to follow. A new 
task will be shown to be at hand for the school to undertake, a 
new method of instruction to be organized by the teacher, a new 
process to be mastered by the pupil. Accordingly, whether any 
difference exists between the two processes of acquiring infor- 
mation which involve reading and what is the extent of such 
difference, if any exists, become topics for our immediate 
consideration. 
Instruction in any subject in the later grades of the school 
should improve upon and be in advance of the instruction that 
is given in earlier grades. If no new problems are at hand for 
the later grades to handle; if there can be no improvement or 
advancement made in the later-grade instruction, then in the 
particular subject under discussion instruction should cease in 
the earlier grades. Our immediate task, as indicated in the 
foregoing paragraph, is to consider what new problems there are 
to confront the upper-grade teacher of reading. In our discus- 
sion we shall refer to the process which must go on before a 
problem can enter the mind as “acquiring information,” and to 
the somewhat similar process which may be carried on while 
a problem is being solved as “collecting data.” Our effort shall 
be to show that the latter process involves reading that is 
assimilative, while the former process usually does not. 
“Acquiring information” does not imply that the means are 
those of assimilation. A review of the characteristics of inde- 
pendent reading is important at this point. Independent read-
-P-A-G-E-298
  
  288 THE TEACHING OF READING 
ing is interesting reading, freed of all requirements that are 
external, and undertaken for the sake of satisfying one’s imme- 
diate personal interests and in order to gratify his curiosity. 
By means of independent reading a person is enabled to acquire 
a broad fund of interesting and useful information. Moreover, 
independent reading is rapid reading. The individual is carried 
rapidly from one point of information to another; rather, his 
attention is turned rapidly from one point to another for the 
reason that the interesting features of one bit of knowledge 
gained arouse a natural curiosity to find out what comes next, 
and so on. Interesting details are considered briefly, and 
dropped quickly for the consideration of others which for the 
time seem to be more interesting; bits of information enter the 
mind, leave their imprint, and go their way; attention is pas- 
sive, following the pathway that is opened up by the process of 
reading and by the reading material; information is acquired, 
but not usually digested. This is the kind of reading that is 
valuable for practice, for the broadening of experience, and for 
preparation for the important process of constructive thinking. 
It is the kind to be emphasized in the intermediate grades and 
to be practiced by the individual throughout his whole lifetime. 
It is not the only kind, however, that is important and valuable, 
as we shall presently discover, for the reason that its very na- 
ture reduces to a minimum the possibility of assimilating in- 
formation while it is being acquired; for the reason that it is 
undertaken merely in order “to believe,” but not “to weigh 
and consider.” 
Of course, as the concluding discussion of our preceding chap- 
ter has made clear, an unconscious assimilation of informa- 
tion does take place at the time one is engaging in independent 
reading. This was defined as an unconscious generalization of 
the multitude of facts as they enter the mind through reading 
into attitudes and feelings and points of view. However valu- 
able for later thinking such unconscious assimilation may be, 
the fact remains that it is assimilation of an elementary sort,
-P-A-G-E-299
  READING IN THE UPPER GRADES 289 
entirely passive in procedure, and indicative of the possibility 
of training the individual to engage in generalizing and assimi- 
lative reading of a higher and yet more valuable type. 
“Collecting data” proceeds by means of assimilative reading. 
The independent reading that the pupil of the intermediate 
grades is encouraged to undertake leads him to the discovery 
of problems in history and geography, in hygiene and nature 
study, or, what is equally important, paves the way for the 
teacher of the upper grades to suggest such problems for solu- 
tion. This is the theory which is gradually being adopted as the 
proper one for the organization of work and study in the ele- 
mentary school beyond the primary grades. To state the matter 
in another way, the large purpose of intermediate-grade instruc- 
tion is to acquaint the pupil with the concrete experiences of 
life in all its varying phases, to fill his mind with a multitude of 
interesting facts, to broaden his experience, to enlarge his in- 
terests; while the important purpose of upper-grade instruc- 
tion is to enable the pupil through much practice to put to- 
gether in his mind groups of facts in their proper relationships 
for the sake of determining the common idea that belongs to 
a group, which is conclusion-drawing, or problem-solving, or 
generalizing. Intermediate-grade reading is concerned with the 
task of initiating and providing the proper basis for the solu- 
tion of problems. It seems that upper-grade reading should be 
concerned with the task of helping to carry on the problem- 
solving which belongs in the later grades of the school. 
In the solution of a problem which has originated in his 
earlier reading, or which the teacher has suggested as growing 
out of a series of facts already in his mind, the pupil usually 
finds that he does not have at hand enough information on any 
one point to justify a conclusion. He turns to reading as the 
chief means of collecting the data that seem necessary to 
answer the question in his mind. Now, if at any time, the 
pupil reads with a purpose. Information that does not bear 
upon the topic under consideration he casts aside; but when a 
 
-P-A-G-E-300
  290 THE TEACHING OF READING 
fact seems to relate to the topic, he attends to it and considers 
it and evaluates it and examines it critically to see what in- 
fluence it may have upon the question in mind. The pupil’s 
main interest now is in the problem and its solution. He reads 
now for the results his reading will bring. He now not merely 
absorbs information; he digests it. He reads now not merely 
“to believe,” but “to weigh and consider.” His reading now is 
assimilative for the reason that he seeks and takes into his 
intellectual system those facts which provide strength for its 
exercise. 
Reading of the sort just described differs from independent 
reading mainly in the matter of the requirements that are 
imposed. Immediate interest no longer dominates, else the 
reading ceases to be assimilative; on the other hand, it is con- 
ditioned at every stage of the process by the requirement of 
attaining an ultimate purpose, of answering a specific question, 
of seeking some definite information. Contrary to the condi- 
tions which prevail in independent reading which carries one 
away in fancy, in reading of this sort conditions are such as to 
make the reader the complete master of the situation. He does 
not passively follow the trend of thought marked out by the 
reading material, as in independent reading. Rather he makes 
use of the reading material in shaping his own trend of thought, 
which is at the time tentatively fixed and previously deter- 
mined upon. In the one type of reading the reader permits him- 
self passively to follow the author’s thought; in the other the 
reader determines his own thinking, using the author’s thoughts 
the while as the needs of the purpose in his mind seem to 
determine. i 
For example, the upper-grade pupil reads “The Log of Tom 
Drake” for the sake of satisfying his immediate interest in this 
story of adventure. As a by-product of his reading he acquires 
a large amount of valuable information on shipping. This in- 
formation, together with similar facts in the pupil’s mind, the 
teacher may refer to in such a way as to arouse questions rela-
-P-A-G-E-301
  READING IN THE UPPER GRADES 291 
tive to the probable future of the United States merchant 
marine. The pupil now sets to work to prepare such a topic for 
class discussion, or for other purposes that may be assigned. 
In his preparation the pupil now reads assigned articles in cur- 
rent periodicals, in his geographic readers, and elsewhere. He 
may re-read parts of “The Log of Tom Drake.” Now his read- 
ing is assimilative for the reason that he reads for the purpose 
of collecting certain definite points of information which will 
enable him to answer a question or to formulate a conclusion. 
When he finds in his reading points of information which do 
not seem to bear upon the topic, he passes over them; those 
which seem to have a bearing he attends to by trying to deter- 
mine their exact importance and precisely how they fit in with 
the body of facts he is building up in the elaboration of his 
topic. 
Thus far our discussion has brought out two points that are 
significant: (1) that acquiring information by means of read- 
ing before a problem is in the mind proceeds by reading that is 
not necessarily assimilative; (2) that collecting data by means 
of reading in the solution of a problem proceeds by reading 
that is assimilative. The essential difference between the two 
types of activity is thus made clear. Our next task appears to 
be that of considering some suggestions for teaching assimila- 
tive reading in the upper grades. We now undertake that task, 
constantly reminding ourselves as we proceed that assimilative 
reading does not begin and independent reading does not end 
with the upper grades, but that independent reading is an im- 
portant activity throughout one’s lifetime and, as has been 
pointed out in previous discussions, assimilative reading may 
develop in earlier grades. 
Suggestions for teaching assimilative reading. The follow- 
ing suggestions are included for the purpose of aiding both 
teacher and pupil in improving the assimilative reading which, 
by right, should occupy an important place in the activities of 
the upper grades:
-P-A-G-E-302
    
292 THE TEACHING OF READING 
. A definite purpose should guide the reading. 
. The reader should attempt to grasp the central thought. 
. The reader should seek a bird’s-eye view. 
. The reader should try to interpret. 
. The reader should judge the worth of statements. 
. The principle of selecting and using ideas should.control. 
A definite purpose should guide the reading, It has already 
been pointed out that assimilative reading is characterized by 
the fact that the reader has a purpose in his reading in the 
nature of a question to be answered or a problem to be solved. 
It has been pointed out further that the project and problem- 
solving work of the upper grades is especially adapted to en- 
couraging this sort of reading activity. The content subjects 
of the upper grades offer numerous opportunities for the prepa- 
ration of topics, for finding the answers to questions, for the 
solution of problems. To the means thus offered by the school 
for the encouragement of assimilative reading the teacher 
should bring supplementary assistance by way of special em- 
phasis on the necessity for a purpose to guide the reading of 
the pupil. 
The need for special help on the part of the teacher is clear. 
In the preparation of a large topic pupils are prone to let them- 
selves be led into confusion through sheer inability to keep the 
large problem in mind while the details are being investigated, 
or through the apparent magnitude of the task which confronts 
them in the beginning. Frequently, too, pupils become so in- 
terested in mere details and in certain side lines of the main 
discussion as to forget the original large task they set out to 
perform. It is quite as necessary, therefore, for the sake of the 
topic being studied as for the quality of the assimilative reading 
that there be someone to act as the guiding spirit of the whole 
discussion. The painstaking teacher of the upper grades finds 
that it is necessary constantly to recall to the attention of the 
pupils the importance and purpose of the large topic or problem 
under consideration, and each day to bring before them the An Por wy
-P-A-G-E-303
  READING IN THE UPPER GRADES 293 
purpose and bearing of the minor details that arise in the dis- 
cussions. This is important for the topic itself, and it is impor- 
tant for the pupil’s reading in the preparation of the topic. 
The teacher must constantly point out, or bring the matter up 
and have the pupils point out, the reasons why certain passages 
are to be read, the answers to be sought in the reading of cer- 
tain selections, the purpose of turning to certain paragraphs for 
further information. 
In addition to reminding the pupils to read with definite 
problems in mind, the teachers should from time to time con- 
duct special class exercises to encourage looking for new prob- 
lems and to give practice in reading carefully to solve problems. 
Certain paragraphs may be assigned for reading in class or in 
study periods for the new problems, or the new bearings on the 
large topic being studied, that may be found in them or sug- 
gested by them. The pupils may be directed to read with such 
questions in mind as: What problem or what new phase does 
the selection suggest? Does the selection suggest anything new 
about the topic? What new questions and problems are sug- 
gested? etc. Practice in reading carefully to solve certain prob- 
lems already in mind is important. ‘“ Follow-up” discussions, to 
point out just what answers the reading gives, are necessary at 
times in order to encourage reading with a purpose. 
The reader should attempt to grasp the central thought. For 
the sake of economy in one’s reading for assimilation it is im- 
portant that as early as possible the reader should grasp the 
central thought that is expressed. The reason is that the cen- 
tral thought of a selection governs the organization of all the 
ideas that are presented. The writer of a selection had a main 
idea to present; in his writing he ordered his entire discussion 
in terms of the main idea. Conversely, in assimilating the 
ideas that have been expressed in writing, it is necessary first 
of all for the reader to get a hint at least of the central thought 
before he can begin to comprehend the details that are pre- 
sented with their arrangement and importance and bearing. 
 
-P-A-G-E-304
  294 THE TEACHING OF READING 
Special instruction and special drill in the methods of looking 
for the central thought in a selection ought to be provided by 
the teacher. The following suggestions on the use of the “sign- 
post” paragraph are pertinent at this point: 
. . . The paragraph that initiated this lesson is from the textbook on 
“Community Life,” and reads as follows: 
There are many different answers to these questions. (What should modern 
education be ? What are the needs of today?) There are many people who 
say that the chief purpose of education should be to prepare boys and girls 
to support themselves; others insist that culture should be the chief goal; and 
a large number declare that education should be primarily for the promotion 
of social efficiency. 
I recalled to the children the facts we had learned in a previous 
lesson, that the Spartans, the Indians, and the Puritans had chosen a 
kind of education for their youth which would prepare them for their 
later life, and that they had succeeded largely because they were united 
in opinion. I then asked them to read the first two paragraphs of the 
section and see if, in the author’s judgment, we are united in our opinion 
today. They found, of course, that there are at least three different 
opinions. After these had been stated, I asked them what they expected 
the author to do in the rest of the section. They answered, ‘He will 
probably tell about each of these aims.” 
We then compared the purpose of this paragraph to that of a sign- 
post, pointing the way of our journey with the author through his 
ideas. Next we pointed out that following the direction of a signpost 
brings the traveler to some destination, and I asked what was probably 
the destination we would reach if we followed the author’s signpost. 
When I suggested that the destination of a discussion is generally a 
conclusion, or a decision, they saw that in this case it would be a deci- 
sion as to which is the best aim of education. At this point I said: “I'll 
give you two minutes to find out which the author thinks is best. 
Where will you look?” “In the first and last sentences of the para- 
graphs,” they answered. Inside of the two minutes they had discovered 
his preference for the third aim. 
The next step was to see why the author expressed a preference and 
what were the faults of the other two aims. They pointed out the 
sentences which gave this information and found that social efficiency 
included both self-support and culture, and training in citizenship be-
-P-A-G-E-305
READING IN THE UPPER GRADES 295 
sides. With these facts in mind the class was next asked to represent 
this signpost paragraph on the board. After a little thought they de- 
cided on a signpost with three arms, all pointing along the same road, 
the first arm bearing the legend “Self-support 3 miles”; the second, 
“Culture 5 miles”; and the third, “Social Efficiency 10 miles.” The 
distances indicate both the order of the three topics in the chapter and 
the fact that the third is larger than the other two. 
The striking points of the lesson were (1) the discovery by the 
pupils that they need read no farther than the second paragraph to 
know the main points of the discussion, (2) the realization that they 
could find quickly the conclusion drawn by the author, as the designa- 
tion of the thought, and (3) the diagrammatic representation of these 
facts by means of the signposts.t 
In addition to the exercises described in the foregoing quota- 
tion the following are important as means of giving practice 
and drill in looking for the central thought: (1) discussing the 
title of the selection, or topic, in order to make clear that the 
central thought is often hinted at in the title and that titles 
should be examined for clues; (2) reading carefully the intro- 
ductory sentences and paragraphs; (3) carefully noting the 
topic sentences of the paragraphs to see how much they con- 
tribute to the main idea; (4) examining each paragraph to see 
if the main idea is repeated and underscoring or making a note 
of each repetition ; (5) deciding how much each paragraph con- 
tributes to the main idea. Such exercises conducted in class 
will do much toward getting the pupils to approach their tasks 
of preparing topics through reading with the proper attitude 
and frame of mind for assimilation. 
The reader should seek a bird’s-eye view. Closely akin to 
the suggestion that the reader should attempt to grasp the 
central thought of a selection is the one that he should seek in 
the beginning of his reading a bird’s-eye view of the ideas that 
the author has presented. In beginning the reading of a new 
' book the pupil should learn to examine the title, the table of 
1Edith Shepherd, “Some Silent-Reading Lessons in Junior High-School 
English,” School Review, March, 1921, pp. 209-210. 
 
-P-A-G-E-306
  
296 THE TEACHING OF READING 
contents, and the chief ideas of the chapters. The same activity 
should be performed before one undertakes the assimilative 
reading of any selection. Taking a few moments to glance at 
the topic sentences of the paragraphs and to consider their ar- 
rangement will help the reader to build up in his mind a frame- 
work upon which to arrange the details as he comes to them 
and considers them in his reading. From time to time class 
exercises may be devoted to such activities as rapidly examin- 
ing selections for the outlines they suggest and setting down 
these outlines for further examination as to their accuracy and 
to the fidelity of the writer in following them. Thus pupils may 
be encouraged to read the selections critically with a view to 
judging whether the writer follows the outline he suggests, is 
orderly in his arrangement of details, and so on. 
Getting a bird’s-eye view ought not to be considered the final 
outcome of one’s effort ; it is rather only the beginning of one’s 
effort to arrive at the thought of the writer. The idea should 
prevail that a bird’s-eye view is important largely for the reason 
that it permits economical reading by encouraging the adop- 
tion of a purpose to be used as a guide and by helping to dis- 
cover the central thought that the author has written down. 
Thus far we have considered three suggestions for encour- 
aging assimilative reading: 
1. A definite purpose should guide the reading. 
2. The reader should attempt to grasp the central thought. 
3. The reader should seek a bird’s-eye view. 
The following quotation contains some valuable suggestions 
relative to all three: 
Reading notes. The question of full or scanty notes arises in reading 
notes as in lecture notes. In general, your notes should represent a 
summary, in your own words, of the author’s discussion, not a duplica- 
tion of it. Students sometimes acquire the habit of reading single sen- 
tences at a time, then of writing them down, thinking that by making 
an exact copy of the book they are playing safe. This is a pernicious 
practice; it spoils continuity of thought and application. Furthermore,
-P-A-G-E-307
READING IN THE UPPER GRADES 207 
isolated sentences mean little, and fail grossly to represent the real 
thought of the author. A better way is to read through an entire para- 
graph or section, then close the book and reproduce in your own words 
what you have read. Next, take your summary and compare with the 
original text to see that you have really grasped the point. This pro- 
cedure will be beneficial in several ways. It will encourage continuous 
concentration of attention to an entire argument; it will help you to 
preserve relative emphasis of parts; it will lead you to regard thought 
and not words. (You are undoubtedly familiar with the state of mind 
wherein you find yourself reading merely words and not following the 
thought.) Lastly, material studied in this way is remembered longer 
than material read scrappily. In short, such a method of reading makes 
not only for good memory, but for good mental habits of all kinds. In 
all your reading, hold to the conception of yourself as a thinker, not a 
sponge. Remember, you do not need to accept unqualifiedly everything 
you read. A worthy ideal for every student to follow is expressed in 
the motto carved on the wall of the great reading-room of the Harper 
Memorial Library at The University of Chicago: “Read not to con- 
tradict, nor to believe, but to weigh and consider.” Ibsen bluntly states 
the same thought : 
Don’t read to swallow; read to choose, for 
°Tis but to see what one has use for. 
Ask yourself, when beginning a printed discussion, What am I look- 
ing for? What is the author going to talk about? Often this will be 
indicated in topical headings. Keep it in the background of your mind 
while reading, and search for the answer. Then, when you have read 
the necessary portion, close the book and summarize, to see if the 
author furnished what you sought. In short, always read for a purpose. 
Formulate problems and seek their solutions. In this way will there be 
direction in your reading and your thought.t 
The reader should try to interpret. Conscious attempt on 
the part of the reader to grasp the meaning the writer seeks to 
convey is important for training in assimilative reading. In the 
preparation of a topic the reader seeks to collect information

pany, Philadelphia, 1916.
-P-A-G-E-308
  298 THE TEACHING OF READING 
which is pertinent ; that is, he reads with a purpose of his own. 
In order best to fulfill his purpose it is necessary that the reader 
determine as nearly as possible just what the writer says and 
how the writer’s ideas and information answer his questions 
and solve his problems. For example, the writer has set down a 
number of ideas and bits of information for the sake of develop- 
ing and elaborating a particular topic, while the reader has in 
mind the collecting of some of the writer’s ideas and informa- 
tion in the development and elaboration of a topic of his own, 
which may differ considerably from the writer’s topic. Conse- 
quently it is important for the reader to approach the reading 
material with a critical, questioning attitude of mind such as 
may be represented in the following questions: What ideas and 
what information does the writer offer? What do these ideas 
and bits of information mean with respect to the writer’s topic? 
What bearing do they have upon the central thought of the 
writer? Do they have a different meaning when set off by 
themselves? What meaning do they have, and how important 
are they in connection with my own topic? It is important for 
pupils to grasp the idea that the writer uses ideas for purposes 
of his own, and that in order to make use of such ideas the 
reader himself must have a purpose in his reading; that he must 
interpret the writer’s ideas and understand how the writer has 
made use of them; and, finally, that he must translate them 
into ideas of his own if he would fit them into their proper places 
in the development of his own topic. 
The reader'should judge the worth of statements. Reference 
to this suggestion has been made from time to time in our fore- 
going discussion. In “collecting data” in the preparation of a 
topic or in order to answer a question or to solve a problem, the 
pupil turns to reading, not “to swallow” everything he reads, 
but in order “to choose” from all that he finds the information 
that suits his purposes. ‘“‘What value do these statements have 
in building up my topic?” is a question the reader should al- 
ways keep in the back of his mind. As foregoing paragraphs
-P-A-G-E-309
  READING IN THE UPPER GRADES 299 
have pointed out, the reader must first of all interpret what the 
writer is saying. The next task is to determine the value of the 
various statements so that irrelevant and unimportant state- 
ments may be cast aside and relevant and important ones 
retained for use. 
The principle of selecting and using ideas should control. 
This suggestion reviews all that have preceded. It defines the 
activities that are performed in assimilative reading. All that 
one undertakes in carrying on the process of assimilation may 
be described by the terms “selecting ideas” and “using ideas.” 
Assimilative reading is no more nor less than selecting from the 
mass of ideas one finds in the reading material those that suit 
his purposes, and using the ones selected according to the de- 
mands imposed by the topic to be prepared, or question to be 
answered, or problem to be solved. The main features of the 
activity have been referred to again and again, especially in the 
suggestions we have just been considering. In assimilative 
reading one seeks a bird’s-eye view of the ideas that are pre- 
sented and attempts to grasp the central thought; he tries to 
interpret the statements of the writer in terms of the use to 
which they are put by the writer and in terms of the possible 
use he himself may make of them; and, on the same bases, he 
judges the worth of the statements—all for the purpose of se- 
lecting and using the ideas he may find as his topic, or question, 
or problem may demand. 
It is important for the teacher constantly to bring before ifs 
pupils suggestions relative to the process of assimilative read- 
ing and to provide training and practice in carrying out such 
suggestions. The following method of procedure has come 
within the observation of the writer and is here offered as sug- 
gestive of what may be undertaken by upper-grade teachers: 
The eighth-grade teacher devoted one of his regular class periods ‘in 
English each week to teaching his pupils how to read and study. This 
was the “reading and study period,” so called in order that the pupils 
would come to understand as quickly as possible the general purpose of 
 
-P-A-G-E-310
  300 THE TEACHING OF READING 
this phase of their work in English. For subject matter and working 
material the teacher would select any topic from a content subject, — 
history, geography, agriculture, etc..—in the preparation of which the 
pupils at the time were busily engaged and with which they were quite 
familiar. Usually the lesson for the day in the content subject was 
chosen as the lesson material for “reading and study.” The purpose of 
the weekly exercise was to train the pupils in methods of preparing their 
lessons with the greatest economy of time and effort. 
At the beginning of the period the class would review quickly the 
work already done in the preparation of the large topic, or project, of 
which the lesson for the day was a part. Next, the teacher would dis- 
cuss with the class the questions and problems relating to the topic 
which yet remained to be answered and solved, stressing the particular 
questions and problems which constituted the work for the day. From 
these the teacher would select a perfectly definite one for special 
investigation and study. Practice in running down the answer, or solu- 
tion, occupied the attention of the class for the remainder of the 
period. Such practice was secured by the class through participation 
in exercises like the following: 
1. Determining tentatively and as quickly as possible the central 
thought of the reading material that had been assigned for reference. 
2. Stating either orally or in writing, as the teacher may have di- 
rected, what bearing this central idea has upon the topic of the day, 
and to what extent it serves to answer the question or solve the problem 
now before the class. 
3. Verifying the tentatively-determined central thought by a rapid 
reading of the whole selection. 
4. Verifying by determining and marking the topic sentences of the 
paragraphs, and by a rapid continuous reading of these in order. 
5. Paraphrasing the topic sentences of the paragraphs, or stating in 
a sentence each the meaning of each paragraph. 
6. Grouping the paragraphs which appear to be very closely related. 
7. Writing a topic heading for each paragraph or group of closely 
related paragraphs. 
8. Determining what each paragraph contributes toward answering 
the question or solving the problem, and how much is left by each 
unanswered or unsolved. 
g. Stating what clues are suggested to the answers and solutions to be 
sought for the kindred questions and problems that are a part of the 
topic under discussion.
-P-A-G-E-311
  READING IN THE UPPER GRADES 301 
The number and order of the exercises were varied as the occasion 
seemed to demand. Criticism by the pupils of the worth of each 
exercise was encouraged and was usually free. Some would point out 
to the class how much help they had secured through certain of the 
exercises, and of how little value other exercises had been; while 
other pupils would offer criticisms that were radically different. Some 
would attempt to show the utter impossibility of understanding a cer- 
tain point without the aid of such and such exercises, and others would 
be equally insistent that these exercises had led them to understand 
nothing they had not already known. Gradually, by means of such open 
discussion and criticism of the exercises, the pupils came to adopt the 
attitude that any of the exercises is valuable only according to the 
demands of the topic being prepared, their understanding of the ques- 
tion, or problem, their present familiarity with the information pre- 
sented, etc., and that in the preparation of their lessons they should 
choose to perform only those exercises which would give them help in 
securing the information and ideas they may be looking for. The pupils 
from time to time were encouraged to offer suggestions relating to the 
modification and improvement of the exercises. Frequently, a part or 
the whole of a class period would be consumed in considering and dis- 
cussing suggestions relative to the best methods of attack on the topic or 
lesson for the day. Interest in and familiarity with the subject matter 
of the topics chosen for lesson material served to prevent, or to relieve, 
the monotony of the practice exercises. 
Assimilative reading and study are synonymous. From time 
to time in our preceding discussions we have pointed out the 
distinction between reading and study. This distinction we 
have preserved in our present discussion of the difference be- 
tween reading to “acquire information” before a problem is 
formed in the mind and reading to “collect data” for the sake 
of solving a problem. Our discussion of assimilative reading 
has been a discussion of methods of study, and the suggestions 
that have been made for the improvement and encouragement of 
assimilative reading have been in reality suggestions which bear 
upon the problem of how to teach upper-grade pupils to study. 
The independent reading taught in preceding grades is to 
continue. “Improvement of one’s ability through much read-
-P-A-G-E-312
    
_ 302 THE TEACHING OF READING 
ing” is the slogan for the upper grades of the school as well as 
for the intermediate and primary grades. If there is to be any 
variation in the amount of independent reading from inter- 
mediate to upper grades, the variation should be in the direc- 
tion of an increase in amount rather than in the direction of a 
decrease, for the reason that upper-grade pupils may be pre- 
sumed to be more effective and more rapid readers than the 
pupils of the lower grades. The reasons for much reading are 
the same whether the pupil is in the upper or the lower grade. 
Independent reading still remains an important means of broad- 
ening experience and of education. 
In the present chapter nothing has been said that detracts in 
the slightest degree from the emphasis that preceding chapters 
have placed upon independent reading. The purpose of the 
present chapter has been rather to point out that there exists 
for the upper-grade teacher of reading a special mission to un- 
dertake in his instruction and a special type of reading ability 
to develop among his pupils. 
Summary. This will conclude our discussion of reading in the 
upper grades. The chapter has made clear the point that there 
exists a special problem of reading instruction for the upper- 
grade teacher to undertake and endeavor to solve. While “col- 
lecting data” in the solution of a problem or in the development 
of a project is a task begun in the lower grades, it remains for 
the upper-grade teacher to devise ways and means of giving 
special help and instruction in the methods of carrying on such 
work. It has been pointed out that the primary purpose of 
intermediate-grade instruction is to fill the minds of the pupils 
with all sorts of valuable and interesting information, to 
broaden their experience through wide reading, and thereby to 
lead them to the discovery of problems, leaving to the upper 
grades the special task of giving pupils exercise in the solution 
of problems. The following suggestions were offered: 
1. A definite purpose should guide the reading. 
2. The reader should attempt to grasp the central thought.
-P-A-G-E-313
  READING IN THE UPPER GRADES 303 
3. The reader should seek a bird’s-eye view. 
4. The reader should try to interpret. 
5. The reader should judge the worth of statements. 
6. The principle of selecting and using ideas should control. 
The foregoing suggestions receive valuable supplement and 
elaboration in the following excerpts from an article by Pro- 
fessor Lyman: 
Silent-reading activities for one day of each week might be distrib- 
uted by months, weeks, and days as follows:

c. Trying to see several words at one time (grouping and phrasing 
for perception of thought groups). 
d. Learning when to read rapidly and when to read slowly. 
2. Second month: Purpose in reading (purposes and problems, old 
and new; goals).

d. Finding a new problem growing out of one’s reading. 
3. Third month: Grasping the central thought in reading (unity and 
forward movement of thought). 
a. Is the master-idea in the title? 
b. Finding the clue sentence and signposts. 
c. Is the master-idea repeated in each paragraph?

hending the reach ; recalling main heads). 
a. Noting the plan of the writer. 
b. Selecting the outstanding ideas.

g. Ninth month: Making use of our reading (active utilization of 
results). 
a. Being alert to solve problems. 
b. Storing ideas away for future use. 
c. Putting information into action. 
d. Various ways of using our reading. L aca an oasecavasn 
The second month’s work, purpose in reading, strikes directly at the 
aimless way in which many pupils take up a book to “get their lesson,” 
after receiving the traditional assignment, “Go as far as page 184,” or 
“Study to the end of the chapter.” Class discussion and laboratory 
work, embracing frequent excursions into current lessons in other 
classes, are based upon what the purpose in reading is, what the specific 
problems in the mind of the reader mean, how the reading itself, ex- 
amined chiefly with certain objectives in mind, may still be able to 
suggest new problems to an alert mind. Here is abundant opportunity 
for developing the contrast between slow, deliberately slow, perusal of 
critical parts which contain the meat for a reader’s primary purpose, 
 
-P-A-G-E-315
  READING IN THE UPPER GRADES 305 
and rapid summary passing over of less essential matters. What is a 
goal in reading? What are the criteria by which side lines may be 
recognized ? 
The work of the third and fourth months has to do with the more 
receptive aspects of the reader’s task. Pupils are to be taught that their 
first duty is finding out, understanding, and remembering exactly what 
the writer has to give them. The eight subheadings indicate lines of 
discussion which will lead to an understanding of and practice in the 
overlooking habits by which a good reader, in a detached and more or 
less impersonal way, gives the writer his opportunity to tell his story 
to a fair-minded listener. 
For months five to eight inclusive are suggested laboratory activities 
which have been found to give seventh- and ninth-grade children much 
delight. They are now specifically taught to regard their reading as a 
process to which they are privileged to contribute. They are playing a 
game as active partners with the writer. Their minds are as active in the 
reading process, trying to help, to supplement, to inquire, and to direct, 
as they are in the oral composition class, when they are listening to one 
of their fellows. Keynotes for the successive months are Helping, Sup- 
plementing, Selecting, and Evaluating. The ninth month brings the cycle 
back to its starting point of months one and two, and leaves uppermost 
in the minds of the pupils the active utilization of results as the chief 
goal of reading for the purpose of study.t 
The next chapter. In the chapters bearing on the methods 
and devices of instruction in reading in the various grades 
(Chapters XI-XVI) a course of study has been mapped out for 
the pupil who is able to complete the regular work of each grade 
on schedule time. In the chapter which immediately follows 
the giving of special help to retarded and backward pupils will 
be the subject of explicit discussion.

  CHAPTER XVII 
SPECIAL HELP TO BACKWARD PUPILS 
Backward pupils add to the complexity of the teacher’s task. 
The discussions of the foregoing chapters on the course of study 
in reading have introduced us to an outline, or schedule, of 
progress in ability to read that is appropriate for children in 
successive grades from the first to the eighth. For each grade, 
or group of grades, a specific purpose of instruction has been 
advanced and a definite degree of ability has been recom- 
mended. In the first grade the problem is to train the pupil to 
attach meanings to the printed symbols of a stock of familiar 
words, to read the simple, interesting selections of his primers 
and first readers with a fair degree of fluency and independ- 
ence, and to acquire a limited ability to recognize new words. 
In the second and third grades the teacher’s task is to encour- 
age the development of ability in comprehension, in rate and 
fluency, and in accuracy and independence, to the end that the 
pupil will have secured a mastery of the mechanics of reading 
by the time he has reached the fourth grade. In the intermedi- 
ate grades the pupil broadens his experience through extensive 
silent reading and thus prepares himself to engage in the activi- 
ties of constructive thinking and to take part in the upper, 
grades in the exercises which give training in assimilative read- 
ing. The instruction recommended for each grade is designed 
to advance the ability of the pupil beyond that of the grade pre- 
ceding and to prepare him to receive the full benefit of the in- 
struction given in the next grade. The supposition prevailed 
that the pupil was prepared for the work of each grade by hav- 
ing completed on schedule time the work of preceding grades.

  SPECIAL HELP TO BACKWARD PUPILS — 307 
That there are to be found in every grade of the school many 
pupils who fail to make progress in ability to read in accord- 
ance with the desired and accepted schedule is a fact that is 
strikingly evident to elementary-school teachers. Some are 
temperamentally slow; others have been the victims of unsuit- 
able methods of instruction in earlier grades; and there are 
others who fall behind because of poor health, or irregular 
attendance, or a late start to school. But whatever the cause of 
backwardness, the fact of consequence is that the presence of 
backward pupils adds to the complexity of the teacher’s task. 
Foregoing chapters have impressed the fact that the teacher 
of reading must constantly be on the alert, must improve every 
moment, and must take advantage of every opportunity, in 
order to be able to advance the pupil, who previously has been 
well prepared, from one grade to the next. The difficulties of 
such a task are apparent only to the thoroughgoing student of 
the reading process and to the conscientious teacher of reading. 
Now, when one adds to these difficulties those which are inci- 
dent to the task of instructing pupils who previously have failed 
in necessary preparation, he begins for the first time to appre- 
ciate the magnitude of the task which confronts the busy 
teacher in every grade of the school. There is the ordinary 
amount of instruction to be carried on for the benefit of the 
pupils who are prepared, and, in addition, there is the special 
help, or the extra instruction, that must be organized and ad- 
ministered to those who in preceding grades have fallen by 
the wayside. 
Backwardness is of various kinds and degrees. One of the 
reasons why the presence of backward pupils in the reading 
class adds so much to the difficulties and complexity of the 
teacher’s task is the fact that backwardness appears in so many 
forms. The term is by no means specific. There are as many 
kinds of backwardness in reading as there are of specific abili- 
ties, and one can find among pupils the lack of specific abilities 
in varying degrees. Indeed, in every grade the teacher will find
-P-A-G-E-318
  308 THE TEACHING OF READING 
as many forms of backwardness in reading as there are pupils 
who are backward. 
In the primary grades there are pupils who are falling behind 
in their ability to recognize words once learned, or only par- 
tially learned; others have difficulty in learning new words 
and, as a consequence, are entirely dependent on the help of 
the teacher ; some flounder in periods of confusion; others read 
laboriously and with an excess of analysis; some read in a 
manner that is lifeless in the extreme; others read with good 
expression, but attach to words only the reactions of pronun- 
ciation. In the grades beyond the primary, pupils are to be 
found who are unable to get meaning because they have never 
mastered the mechanics of the process, while others accomplish 
just as little in reading for meaning, for the reason that they 
have mastered mechanics for mechanics’ sake alone and en- 
tirely apart from interpretation. Some are slow and laborious ; 
others skim the pages of their reading with reckless abandon. 
Many pupils are retarded in silent-reading ability because of 
too much instruction in oral reading, and there are others who 
find it difficult to get meaning because of very limited reading 
experience. The classifications’ of errors in oral and silent 
reading, shown on the following page, are suggestive of the ex- 
tent and variety of the types of backwardness among children 
in the grades. 
Deficiencies can be met through individual instruction. The 
fact of greatest significance to the thoroughgoing teacher of 
reading who would undertake the organization of remedial 
instruction is that remedies cannot be applied to the cases of 
backwardness indiscriminately. The reason is clear that the 
teacher would not think of giving second-grade instruction to 
a fourth-grade pupil or of intermingling first-grade pupils with 
third-grade pupils. The reason is no greater why the pupil who 
has difficulty in recognizing words independently and the pupil

310 THE TEACHING OF READING 
who reads for pronunciation rather than meaning should be put 
together in the same class and subjected to the same remedial 
treatment. The teacher recognizes that the various abilities 
that are necessary for effective reading require for their devel- 
opment each a special device of instruction. It requires no 
different line of reasoning to reach the conclusion that the 
pupils of a grade who are afflicted with different kinds and 
degrees of backwardness need each of them a special form of 
help. The failure of regular instruction to meet individual 
needs is illustrated in the following paragraphs: 
Four years ago a boy who now ranks slightly above the average of 
his age-group in general intelligence began his school career. He ad- 
vanced regularly with his class until the autumn of 1920. At that time 
it became necessary for him to discontinue regular school work because 
he was unable to read. In class discussions, in ability to solve problems, 
and in all phases of school work which did not involve reading he 
equalled or excelled his classmates. 
A careful analysis revealed the fact that the boy had never estab- 
lished the habit of moving his eyes regularly from left to right along a 
line. At times the first fixation was near the end of the line ; frequently 
it was near the middle of the line; and sometimes it was near the be- 
ginning. The remaining fixations were irregular and followed no definite 
order. Drill exercises were organized which consisted of series of short 
words typewritten with half-inch horizontal spacing. The boy was 
required to read these words for five minutes each day in order to 
cultivate regular habits of eye-movement. That there was rapid reor- 
ganization of his method of procedure was clearly evident in his 
reading. After considerable progress had been made, a simple story 
was typewritten, again with a half-inch space between each unit. 
Finally, stories were read, still during the drill periods, directly from 
books. The facility and accuracy with which he came soon to read indi- 
cated that one of his major difficulties had been corrected. Other prob- 
lems, such as increasing the span of recognition, were then attacked. At 
the present time the boy is making rapid progress and will doubtless be 
able to resume work with his class at the end of the first half-year of 
the school year. 
This case has been cited as an illustration of the failure of regular 
instruction to meet individual needs. There are doubtless thousands of
-P-A-G-E-321
  SPECIAL HELP TO BACKWARD PUPILS 311 
boys and girls who fail each year and are unable to continue with their 
classmates because of peculiar defects which could be readily remedied. 
The results are discouragement, retardation, and elimination in far too 
many cases.* 
‘As a necessary preliminary to the giving of special help to 
backward pupils the teacher must be able to recognize not only 
that certain pupils are backward but also in each case what 
particular ability each pupil lacks.) The pupil who fails is easy 
to recognize ; why he fails and at what points are problems not 
always easy of solution. The teacher who is not qualified to 
teach reading because he does not know what specific abilities 
ought to be developed in each grade, and the methods to be 
employed in developing each, will find the task of determining 
the causes of backwardness insurmountable. The teacher who 
is qualified to teach reading can determine why and at what 
points pupils are falling behind, because he knows and is able 
to recognize the abilities that are the waymarks of every stage 
of progress through the grades. The present chapter will be 
developed on the assumption that being able to recognize the 
presence of specific abilities is the equivalent of being able to 
recognize their absence. 
(The failure of most teachers to alleviate the difficulties inci- 
dent to the task of helping their backward pupils to reach the 
standard set for their grade in school is due in most cases to 
the fact that backward pupils are considered as belonging in a 
class by themselves. Sometimes, of course, no effort is made 
to organize special help, but not infrequently it occurs that the 
teacher makes an honest effort to deal with the problem of 
backwardness and fails because the backward pupils are treated 
as a group rather than as individuals. The physician is suc- 
cessful only to the extent that his diagnosis of the ills of his 
patient is correct and his application of remedies specific. The

and Sixth Grades,” the Twentieth Yearbook of the National Society for the 
Study of Education, Part II, pp. 48-49.
-P-A-G-E-322
  
312 THE TEACHING OF READING 
“cure all” is anathema to the reputable physician. The suc- 
cessful teacher of arithmetic prescribes a special remedy for the 
pupil who is deficient in subtraction and one that is quite dif- 
ferent from the one prescribed for the pupil who cannot multi- 
ply. Likewise, the teacher of reading must apply “cures” that 
are specifics, rather than “cure alls,” if he would hope to re- 
move the reading defects of the pupils who previously have 
failed to make progress. 
Special help should be undertaken by the classroom teacher. 
The tendency of a large number of teachers of reading is to 
postpone the consideration of the problem of organizing special 
help for the backward pupils until the matter is brought to their 
attention by the supervisor or “special” teacher. This tendency 
results in most cases, not from a desire to shirk the ordinary 
duties of instruction, but from a natural hesitation on the part 
of the teacher to undertake the performance of a task for which 
he considers himself unprepared. It is one of the aims of the 
present chapter, therefore, to impress the fact that the class- 
room teacher has the best opportunity and is the best-equipped 
individual in the school system to initiate the work of helping 
the backward pupil, and that he is successful only to the extent 
of his ability to bring all his pupils up to the standard set for 
his grade. To this end the chapter will describe a number of 
specific remedial devices of instruction, such as have been tried 
out with success with individual cases of backwardness and are 
illustrative of what any well-prepared classroom teacher is able 
to undertake without the assistance of “special helpers,” 
“trained supervisors,” or “experts.” The following excerpts 
from an account of how a teacher in the fourth grade gave 
special instruction to her backward pupils are suggestive: 
In October pupils were tested to ascertain the oral- and silent-reading 
rate of each individual. Five oral and five silent trials were made, 
and the averages obtained and used as measures of reading rate. The 
pupils were then asked to read as much as possible in a minute without 
making any mistakes. With but one exception the rapid readers made
-P-A-G-E-323
  
SPECIAL HELP TO BACKWARD PUPILS 313 
fewer mistakes. Comprehension was tested informally. Rapidity and 
comprehension seemed to go together. Intensive instruction was given. 
Especial attention was paid to poor readers. After two weeks there was 
no improvement in the rate of the three poorest readers. The only 
noticeable improvement was made by the better readers. It was evident 
that the least capable were getting the least from instruction, though 
receiving more attention. This presented a problem. Why did they fail 
to improve? They were questioned. Not one of them liked to read. 
Not one did any reading except when forced to do it. They liked to 
listen to stories. How could they be reached ? 
Ten types of instruction were planned to cover as many individual 
needs. The class reader was supplemented by a carefully selected list 
of books for extensive reading. Methods were devised whereby maxi- 
mum effort would be called forth and interest sustained. Rate was 
found to be a measure of improvement which the children could com- 
prehend. They were therefore made aware of their rate of reading and 
kept graphic records of their individual standings in monthly regroup- 
ing tests. “A” readers were those whose rate was more than thirteen 
lines per minute. They were given the privilege of selecting their own 
material from the supplementary bookshelf for silent reading. This 
shelf was called “Story Row.” The books were arranged in groups ac- 
cording to content.- A regular library system was used so that the 
teacher could ascertain at any time what each child was reading and 
what he had finished. The quality of the silent reading could thus be 
revealed by conversation with the pupil. Children who had enjoyed a 
book were asked to review it for others who might care to read it. 
Favorite chapters were illustrated. Some children chose informational 
material. They would recount interesting things which they had learned 
from their reading, and create a great demand for the book which they 
had read. No more than two books could be used by a pupil at one 
time, and stories had to be finished before another story book could 
be begun. 
“B” readers were those whose rate was more than nine lines per 
minute but not more than thirteen. Pamphlets were provided for their 
supplementary reading. The material was easier and the content quite 
suited to their comprehension. Otherwise the systems used, for the 
“B” readers was like that for the “A” groups. They had Jess time for 
supplementary reading, as they required more intensive work with the
-P-A-G-E-324
  314 THE TEACHING OF READING 
teacher. Their pamphlets were very popular and were often read by 
“A” readers. 
There was also a group called “C” readers, whose rate was between 
six and nine lines per minute, and another group, of ‘‘D” readers, who 
read even more slowly and got practically no meaning from the subject- 
matter. Their supplementary material consisted of separate stories. 
These they read with the teacher, alternating with her. They liked to 
have stories read to them. The teacher used her book. The group looked 
over her shoulder and kept the place, picking up the story and reading 
on when she stopped, until the end of a paragraph was reached. The 
meaning was then discussed and the reading continued. 
Each child in the class subscribed to a little nature magazine, which 
was kept in the desks for reading during odd minutes. Several other 
magazines, an atlas, and a file containing good original stories by the 
children were also at their disposal for this purpose. 
The regular reading instruction was the visible means by the aid of 
which each pupil hoped to get into a higher group than his own by the 
next measurement. 
These groupings were based on rate and were not identical with 
those made for corrective teaching. The procedures just described, 
together with the intensive teaching in type lessons which follow, were 
jointly responsible for improvements in reading rate and quality. This 
report would therefore be incomplete if detailed descriptions of methods 
used to secure the interest of the individual child were omitted. 
TYPES OF INDIVIDUAL INSTRUCTION 
Type lesson 1. All look at the first phrase, looking up when they 
reach a comma or a period. When the entire group is looking at the 
teacher, she nods, and they repeat the phrase. She watches individuals 
to find their difficulties, but does not interrupt. When they have said all 
but the last word of the phrase, they again look down, silently getting 
the next phrase and looking up, holding the phrase in mind until all are 
ready. Again the teacher nods, and the group gives the phrase orally, 
looking down at the last word and continuing this procedure to the 
end of the paragraph or section. The intensive study calculated to 
improve poor readers can be made to yield a double return if, instead of 
selecting hard words and subjecting them to analytic study, the unit is 
the phrase or group of words which expresses an idea. Instead of work- 
ing at a difficult word, the phrase in which it appears is studied until
-P-A-G-E-325
  SPECIAL HELP TO BACKWARD PUPILS 315 
mastered. Instead of working with one child at a time and giving each 
child only a few minutes of actual oral reading, four or five of those 
who have similar ability are grouped together, while other groups of 
poor readers follow silently. Third-grade material or very simple 
fourth-grade material is used for this purpose. 
While other pupils are being tested, the ones who have had Type 1 
answer mentally or in writing blackboard questions concerning the 
material of their lesson. Occasionally duplicated sheets containing un- 
completed sentences or a story are used instead, the children filling in 
the blanks mentally or in writing. 
Type lesson 2. Eye training and focus. Field of vision enlarged to 
include several words rather than one. First, by having the book far 
enough from the eyes. Secondly, by eliminating the use of a finger or 
other place-keeping device. Thirdly, by work with flash cards, flashing 
phrases, trying to get a phrase at one flash, and counting the number 
of flashes needed for each phrase. These phrases were cut from current 
printed matter and mounted on small cards. Written sentences direct- 
ing children to perform certain activities were also used as flash mate- 
rial. The one who first read the direction carried it out. The one who 
had three such opportunities in succession was given a sheet with similar 
work for silent reading and could return to the group when finished. 
Type lesson 3. Silent reading for the purpose of oral reproduction 
and comprehension. 
Type lesson 4. Silent reading in search of a given phrase, answer, 
idea, or suggestion in the content of supplementary books, geography 
text, arithmetic text, and blackboard work. 
Type lesson 5. Differentiation for pupils who confuse similar words 
or miscall syllables, guess at words, or omit endings. Lists like the 
following form the basis of such work. Lists are compiled from actual 
mistakes made by children. 
that then their women every ever 
when how there man never etc. 
what who than woman ~~ even 
Type lesson 6. Lessons in accuracy for those who make errors, sub- 
stitutions, and omissions ; reading a page orally and counting errors, or 
reading until they make an error to see how many lines they can read 
perfectly. 
Type lesson 7. Breathing exercises. Children taught to breathe 
rhythmically at ends of phrases or clauses instead of breaking the 
 
-P-A-G-E-326
  316 THE TEACHING OF READING 
smoothness of oral reading. Practice in breath control is thus related 
to the problem of meaning and interpretation. Abdominal breathing 
taught. 
Type lesson 8. Articulation exercises for mumblers or those with 
other bad speech habits. 
Type lesson 9. Voice work and expression. Unpleasant voice quality 
and monotony corrected by special practice and training. Children are 
taught to vary meaning by change of stress and to show relative im- 
portance of ideas similarly. Punctuation is studied for the same purpose. 
Type lesson 10. Word study, with difficult words, for ready recogni- 
tion, pronunciation, and comprehension. Word building and word 
structure studied. 
The types of instruction most needed by pupils, whether good or poor 
readers, are Types 3 and 4. Individual difficulties are very noticeable, 
especially in Types 6 and 7. Types 1 and 2 are evidently very essential 
to poor readers; Types 8 and 9 show the effect of previous training. 
Type 10 was needed by all but exceptionally facile readers, who, instead, 
kept a list of words which they wanted to look up in the dictionary and 
used the time given to the remainder of the class as a whole for that 
purpose. 
The study has resulted in definite conclusions which will influence 
the writer’s method of instruction. . . . The efficiency and economy of 
instruction are very dependent on (1) individual diagnosis, (2) indi- 
vidual remedial work, (3) thorough analysis and regular measurement 
of individual improvement, (4) motivation, (5) provision for suitably 
graded extensive reading, (6) system in application of diagnostic tests 
and remedial work, (7) correct valuation and proportional stress on 
various types of reading, (8) a realization that special habits cannot 
be formed by general training and practice. 
To teachers who are prone to labor under the impression that 
none but the trained expert is able to diagnose individual fail- 
ings of pupils, and to prescribe in each case the proper remedy, 
the following comment by the writer of the foregoing quoted 
paragraphs may contain a very valuable suggestion :

  SPECIAL HELP TO BACKWARD PUPILS 307 
This study was not conducted by a specialist, but by a grade teacher 
interested in the advancement of the class through methods which reach 
the individual members. No time was taken from other studies. In 
fact, a similar experiment in individual instruction was simultaneously 
carried on in spelling, arithmetic, and penmanship. The results were 
tested and are evidence that no one subject was overstressed. The time 
economy, resulting from scientific procedure, also made possible a full- 
ness and breadth of teaching usually thought incompatible with stand- 
ardization and educational measurement.+ 
Examples of special help to backward pupils. In the pages 
which immediately follow a number of typical cases of back- 
wardness will be described and the kind of remedial instruction 
employed in each case will be reported. These examples are 
copied, with condensations, from the published reports of the 
remedial work in reading that has been carried on in the public 
schools of Stoughton, Wisconsin,” and in the Elementary School 
of The University of Chicago.* The topic headings and conden-

A FLUENT ORAL READER WHO COMPREHENDED NOTHING 
READ SILENTLY* 
Description: Designated Case “A.” Case “A” is that of a fourth- 
grade girl described by her teacher as slow and indifferent. Though 
somewhat below the standard for her grade in oral reading, she, never- 
theless, was able to read with a fair degree of speed and fluency. In 
silent reading, the girl used lip movement, which showed that she read 
all the words. In order to test her ability to handle the reading material 
used in her reading class, the girl was directed to read silently a selec-

tion for the purpose of getting the thought well enough to reproduce it 
later. The material was chosen from page 57 of the Merrill Fourth 
Reader. She read the selection with a marked degree of lip movement 
at the rate of 1.05 words per second. She was able to reproduce prac- 
tically nothing of what she had read. 
To discover if mechanics of reading was causing the difficulty, she 
was asked to read the same material orally. She read fluently and with 
expression at the rate of 1.01 words per second, making only five errors. 
Diagnosis and problem. The diagnosis of the case was as follows: 
Knowledge of the rudimentary mechanics permitted her to read far 
beyond her comprehension. She read words as names and not as sym- 
bols of ideas. The problem was plainly that of training her to read for 
content. 
Remedial lessons. Remedial lessons consisted of the silent reading 
of paragraphs cut from second- and third-grade readers. One thirty- 
five-minute lesson a week was given for six weeks. Seven lessons were 
given during this time inasmuch as two were given during the first week 
in April. From five to seven paragraphs were used in each lesson. The 
first paragraph read was very short, containing few separate thoughts. 
Each succeeding paragraph, being slightly longer, provided for gradual 
growth in the ability to get meanings from the page. 
Meanings of words rather than the way they were pronounced and 
phrases as thought units rather than words were emphasized. Nothing 
was said of lip movement or rate. The purpose of the reading was 
to secure an understanding of the content of the paragraph. 
After she had given a reproduction of the “story” and had an- 
swered a number of specific questions about it, she was asked to re- 
read the selection in search of any thoughts she had overlooked during 
the first reading. She then gave a second reproduction. This last re- 
production was, no doubt, largely a result of the specific questions. 
Nevertheless, it was valuable in training the pupil to see the richness of 
content in the selection. 
The material increased in difficulty as the lessons went on, involving 
more and more difficult words and more complicated phrasing. A com- 
plete record was kept of the work accomplished in each lesson. 
Results. That there resulted a decided growth in quality of silent 
reading is evidenced by the fact that in March, Case “A” was reading 
short selections of from 17 to 40 words each in a second-grade reader 
with difficulty, while in May she was reading selections of over 150 
words in length from a fourth-grade reader and was reproducing the

  SPECIAL HELP TO BACKWARD PUPILS 319 
thought with a high degree of accuracy. During this period no mention 
was made of lip movement. The girl evidently discovered for herself 
that lip movement interfered with ability to read in thought units, for, 
after April 29, her record shows a complete elimination of it. In De- 
cember, Case “A” was unable to reproduce a single thought or to 
answer a single question when subjected to a standardized silent-reading 
test. In May, she was fairly efficient in reproduction ability. 
A SECOND-GRADE CHILD WHO COULD NOT READ 
PRIMER MATERIAL? 
Description: Designated Case “B.” Case “B” is that of a second- 
grade boy who started work in the third grade this fall but was sent 
back to the second grade in all subjects but arithmetic shortly after 
school opened. He has intelligent American foster parents and his 
home environment is good. He is exceedingly active on the playground 
and talks intelligently when asked questions. 
His teachers’ records show the following estimates: (a) health, ex- 
cellent ; (b) conduct, good; (c) disposition, bright. His last teacher, 
however, described him as inattentive. He has never been strong in any 
subject and has been weakest in reading and spelling. This boy was 
eight years and four months of age when selected for special training 
February 12, 1919. He had taken the various standardized tests given 
to his grade during the year and he proved to be the slowest, most 
inefficient reader in his class. 
Diagnosis. This case was diagnosed as follows: The boy’s difficulties 
in reading were due to a lack of familiarity with printed words and an 
utter lack of phonetic power. 
Remedial lessons. In an effort to help him overcome this handicap, 
instruction was confined to phonics for one month, and from that time 
on consisted of a combination of phonics, oral reading and silent read- 
ing for rate and quality with the emphasis placed upon oral reading for 
quality. By quality is meant accuracy. The lessons averaged twenty- 
five to thirty minutes in length. 
a. Phonics (10 lessons). The phonograms taught were presented in 
this way. A familiar word or some word of special interest to the boy 
was used as a key word. Without separating the words, as “r-ace,” the 
1C. J. Anderson and Elda Merton, “Remedial Work in Reading,” Elemen- 
tary School Journal, May, 1920, pp. 692-701,
-P-A-G-E-330
  320 THE TEACHING OF READING 
phonogram, or “helper,” as he called it, was found and circled; in the 
case of “race” the letters “ace” were circled. As many words contain- 
ing this “helper” as could be thought of by both the boy and the 
instructor were built up. Each day a record was kept of the words 
reviewed and the number of errors made. During this time (one month), 
368 words were built up involving 19 phonograms. 
Results. This instruction carried on for a period of one month en- 
abled the pupil in an oral-reading test involving the reading of standard- 
ized paragraphs of increasing difficulty (Gray’s Oral-Reading Test) to 
improve his standing from o in the first test to a score of 43 points above 
the standard for his grade in the final test. 
b. Reading (26 lessons). Each of the twenty-six lessons given from 
March 14 to May 15 included four distinct kinds of work, with emphasis 
placed upon oral reading for quality and content, namely, word recogni- 
tion, oral reading for quality and content, silent reading for rate and 
quality, and oral reading for rate. 
1. Word recognition. This drill, given at the beginning of each lesson, 
included (a) words missed in previous lessons; (b) words to be met 
in the advanced reading lesson. Both new and review words were 
written upon the board. As a word was pronounced correctly, the boy 
erased it. In this way, only the difficult words remained on the board 
and were given special attention. They were not erased until they could 
be given correctly. These words were listed and became the review 
words of the succeeding lesson. 
2. Oral reading for quality and content. By quality is meant the 
number of errors rather than pitch, expression, articulation, etc. No 
attention was called to the latter; however, the improvement was 
marked. At the close of the story, parts of special interest were dis- 
cussed and characters compared. A careful record was kept of the 
number and kinds of errors made each day. 
Results. There was a very material decrease in the four most com- 
mon errors of this pupil, namely, repetitions of words and phrases, 
repetitions to correct errors, omissions, and substitutions. For example, 
in reading the primer at the beginning of the training period the pupil 
omitted one word in every 396; in reading a second-grade reader 
toward the close of the period but one word in every 1285 was omitted. 
3. Silent reading for rate and quality. Pages cut from old primers 
containing interesting passages averaging about seventy words in length 
were used for this work. The child was given the sheet wrong side up 
and instructed to turn over the page and read silently for content at the
-P-A-G-E-331
  SPECIAL HELP TO BACKWARD PUPILS 321 
signal “Turn.” During the reading both lip movement and the number 
of seconds required to read the selection were noted and recorded. The 
child was next given practice in reproducing the thought of the selection 
and in answering specific questions upon it. A written record of the 
reproduction and answers to specific questions was kept for purposes 
of comparison. 
4. Oral reading for rate. At the close of each lesson the paragraph 
used for silent reading was read orally. 
Results. In silent reading, improvement was as follows: (1) rate 
almost doubled; (2) quality more than doubled and four points 
above the standard for his grade; (3) lip movement eliminated. 
In oral reading, improvement, as revealed by testing with the Gray 
Oral-Reading Test, is indicated in the following scores: pupil’s score at 
the beginning of the training period, 0; at end of period, 50; standard 
score for first grade, 31; standard for second grade, 43. 
A CHILD WHO REPEATED IN ORAL READING?1 
Description: Designated Case “D.” Case “D” is that of a fourth- 
grade boy who was nine years and eleven months of age when training 
was begun in February, 1918. He has been weak in reading since he 
entered the first grade. Tested in oral and silent reading, his scores were 
far below the standard for his grade. His oral reading was especially 
poor, due to a great number of repetitions and substitutions. He made 
an average of one. repetition for every thirty-four words read and one 
substitution for every eighteen words read. 
Diagnosis. The diagnosis of this case was as follows: From the large 
number of repetitions in his oral reading it was evident that part of this 
boy’s trouble in both oral- and silent-reading was due to the fact that he 
could not phrase properly. Getting no meaning from the sentence as he 
phrased it, he repeated in an attempt to get something from the sentence 
by means of a second reading. It was also evident that substitutions 
were destroying meaning both in his oral and silent reading. 
Remedial lessons. Remedial instruction consisted entirely of practice 
in phrasing. It began with sentences written upon the blackboard. The 
boy marked off the phrasing that he considered correct with short 
vertical lines which he drew at the close of each phrase, as in the sen- 
tence, ‘One morning when he went out very early he saw tracks on the 
1C. J. Anderson and Elda Merton, “ Remedial Work in Reading,” Elemen- 
tary School Journal, June, 1920, pp. 778-782.

  322 THE TEACHING OF READING 
snow.” His first attempt resulted in this division, “One morning | when 
he went out | very early he saw | tracks on the snow.” After a question 
from the instructor he decided to change the phrasing. The following 
change was made: ‘‘One morning | when he went out very early | he saw” 
tracks | on the snow.” After he had become accustomed to this new way 
of reading, work was begun in third-grade readers. 
In the first lesson the boy read the selection through once without 
help of any kind. As he read, a record was kept of all errors made. He 
was then given a small white card 4 inches by 14 inches, which was to 
take the place of the vertical lines used in the blackboard exercises. 
He then re-read the selection, using the card as he read. He placed it at 
the close of the first phrase. After reading this phrase he raised the card 
and placed it at the close of the next, and so on, until he had finished the 
selection. This proved to be very slow and difficult work in the begin- 
ning. Many times the card was placed after the wrong word, and it 
needed skillful questioning to lead him to see his error. After reading 
the selection two or three times in this way, he was asked to read it 
without the card. The result was a remarkable change in this boy’s 
reading. Errors were practically eliminated, phrasing was almost per- 
fect, and expression greatly improved. A record was kept, also, of the 
errors made in this last reading of the selection. 
After the second lesson each special help period consisted of four 
phases : 
1. A review of the selection studied in the previous lesson, a record 
being kept of all errors made. This record was used as a check on the 
records made in the last reading at the close of the previous lesson, since 
it was difficult to say how much of the latter was due to memory work. 
2. The reading of the new selection for the first time without help 
of any kind. The record of the errors made in this reading was the one 
watched most closely, since the improvement in the boy’s reading of 
material at sight was to be the true test of the success or failure of the 
training given. 
3. Two or three careful readings of the selection with the help of 
the card. No record of errors was kept during this practice period, 
entire attention being given to phrasing. 
4. A final reading of the selection without the card. A record of 
errors was kept during this reading to show the boy as well as the 
instructor the effect of the practice upon his reading. 
Results. In thirty lessons, which extended over a period of less than 
three months, the number of repetitions decreased as follows: first 10 
 
-P-A-G-E-333
  SPECIAL HELP TO BACKWARD PUPILS B25 
lessons, one repetition in every 59 words read; second 10 lessons, one in 
282 words read; third 10 lessons, o in 3045 words read. Improvement 
in general reading ability is indicated in the amount read during each 
series of 10 lessons ; first 10 lessons, 1892 words read ; second 10 lessons, 
1696 words read; third ro lessons, 3045 words read. 
A FOREIGN CHILD WHO WAS HANDICAPPED IN HIS THIRD- 
GRADE READING BECAUSE OF MEAGER VOCABULARY? 
Description: Designated Case “E.” Case “E” is that of a foreign 
child with a meager background for reading. Polish is spoken entirely 
in the home and mail-order catalogs are the only reading materials 
found there. The boy entered the first grade in 1916 at the age of eight 
years and eleven months. His teacher immediately transferred him to 
the second grade because of his age and size, overlooking his incom- 
petence for the work. He entered the third grade the next fall, where 
he remained the next two years. At the time special training was begun 
the boy was eleven years of age with a background hardly that of an 
ordinary first-grade child. 
Diagnosis. In the reading of three test paragraphs, fourteen substitu- 
tions were made. These were of such a nature as to do away entirely 
with meaning. This showed clearly that reading to this child was mere 
word calling and that any word would serve the purpose. 
Remedial lessons. Immediate training was given in word analysis. 
The most common phonograms and a few phonetic rules were taught. 
Oral reading in the Free and Treadwell Primer was begun. This ma- 
terial was suited to his ability, but not to his interests. Oral reading 
from books was discontinued for a time and conversation lessons about 
things in which he was interested were substituted. Topics relating to 
the making of a kite, fishing, etc., were discussed. At the close of a 
period the discussion was summed up in a few sentences which the 
teacher wrote upon the board as the boy gave them. This was made 
the story for oral reading in that lesson. 
Later the boy was supplied with advertisements from magazines. 
These were selected because of the larger-sized print. A booklet 64 
by 94 inches was made for the boy. An attractive picture was pasted 
on the cover and under it was printed, “Words That I Know.” The in- 
1C. J. Anderson and Elda Merton, “ Remedial Work in Reading,” Elemen- 
tary School Journal, June, 1920, pp. 783-785.

  324 THE TEACHING OF READING 
side leaves were cut in along the right-hand margin and alphabetically 
indexed. All words which the boy was able to pronounce and define or 
use in sentences were cut out and pasted in his “dictionary.” The meager 
vocabulary of words he could define when the work was begun is illus- 
trated by the use of some of the words which he was able to pronounce : 
thick The clock thicks. (ticks) 
win The win is blowing. (wind) 
right Apples are right. (ripe) 
sand We sand for suits. (send) 
This work was carried on together with training in word analysis 
during ten lessons. 
Results. At the end of ten lessons the following had been accom- 
plished : 
1. His book contained 315 words. 
2. He had grown in his power to attack new words. 
3- His dislike for printed symbols had changed to a desire for, and a 
pride in, word mastery of both form and meaning. 
4. Unconsciously he had been acquiring some dictionary knowledge 
through the use of the alphabetical arrangement of his book and the idea 
of meanings for words. 
The next five lessons were confined to oral reading of stories of boys’ 
experiences and of animals found in the Elson First Reader and the 
Beacon introductory Second Reader. Each lesson showed a slow but 
gradual growth in reading power. The descriptive paragraphs in these 
selections were read silently and reproduced by the pupil. 
At this point the family left the city. Although the experiment is 
incomplete, the case illustrates the results which can be accomplished 
after a child once has the right start in the necessary mechanics of 
reading and the interpretation of printed symbols into meanings. 
A FIFTH-GRADE PUPIL WHO READ SLOWLY BECAUSE HE 
RECOGNIZED IN VERY SMALL UNITS OF FIXATION? 
Description. Frequent tests and observations revealed the fact that 
this pupil read very slowly.

and Sixth Grades,” the Twentieth Yearbook of the National Society for the 
Study of Education, Part II, pp. 48-49.
-P-A-G-E-335
  SPECIAL HELP TO BACKWARD PUPILS 325 
Diagnosis. An analysis of his difficulties showed clearly that he did 
not recognize words in groups or thought units. 
Remedial lessons. In order to provide training in the rapid recogni- 
tion of groups of words, eight phrase books were prepared in which a 
phrase was pasted on each page. The first book contained ten very 
simple phrases cut from a primer. Each succeeding book in the series 
contained a similar number of longer and more difficult phrases. The 
eighth book contained phrases from a sixth reader. In conducting drill 
exercises the teacher flashed each page so quickly that the pupil had 
time for only one fixation. As soon as a phrase had been exposed, the 
pupil immediately told what he had seen. A grade of ten was given for 
each entirely correct response. Since each book contained ten phrases, 
the scoring was very simple. 
A record was kept of the progress through six books in fourteen 
lessons. As a rule thirty phrases were presented each day ; occasionally, 
the drill was limited to twenty; sometimes it included forty. A given 
book of phrases was not discontinued until the boy had scored 100 in 
two successive lessons. For example, a score of 100 was made -the 
second time the phrases of Book I were presented. Drill was discon- 
tinued until the next day. On repeating the exercise a score of 100 was 
again made. Book II was then begun, and the exercise was repeated 
seven times before a perfect score was made. At the conclusion of an 
exercise the pupil was shown his score. 
Results. At the close of each lesson the boy was given a selection 
from his reader and allowed to read for one minute. His rate for each 
lesson is shown in the accompanying table. The entries in the table

indicate clearly that the drill exercises proved effective in increasing 
his rate of reading.

  326 THE TEACHING OF READING 
A FIFTH-GRADE PUPIL WHO READ SLOWLY BECAUSE OF 
WORD DIFFICULTIES! 
Description: Designated Case “G.” Case “G” is that of a girl in 
the lower fifth grade, age 10 years and 11 months when selected for 
" special training in November, 1916. She was rated by her teachers as 
a good student in subjects other than reading. Reading seemed to be 
her greatest weakness. Her fourth-grade teacher reported her as “a 
slow reader who reads hesitatingly and haltingly, repeating words and 
phrases. Her breathing is very shallow, often causing her to pause for 
breath in the middle of a word or phrase. Her voice is thick, heavy, and 
unpleasantly nasal. Silent reading is particularly distasteful to her. 
She always settles down to it reluctantly and tardily.” 
From the home comes much the same story. “She has never read a 
story to herself, though she has several attractively illustrated children’s 
books. She frequently, however, after eagerly studying the illustrations 
in a new book, begs to have the story read to her, saying, ‘You read it, 
mother. I can’t understand it very well when I read it myself.’ ” 
In an oral-reading test, her pronunciation of unfamiliar words seemed 
most difficult. She usually hesitated a moment before attacking a new 
word and then whispered to herself the spelling of the word letter by 
letter. The repetitions all occurred in phrases containing a difficult 
word. The omissions were almost entirely the small words: “his,” 
“the,” “and,” etc. Her score in oral reading was considerably below 
the standard for her grade. 
Her rate in a silent-reading test shows an unusual condition. It is 
practically .6 of a word slower than the oral rate. This fact taken in 
connection with her score for comprehension shows clearly what the 
child had discovered for herself, namely, that she does not understand 
much of the “story” when she reads silently. 
Observations made during the silent-reading tests showed that there 
was much vocalization. The reading was done in a low whisper, and 
difficult words, as stated above, were spelled out letter by letter. She 
followed the line with her finger. In one of the early practice periods, 
when urged to read more rapidly, she remonstrated, saying that she 
could not hear the words so well if she did.

Diagnosis. The difficulties of Case ‘“G” were due to a lack of fa- 
miliarity with printed words and a lack of method of working out new 
or unknown word forms. 
Remedial lessons. In an effort to help her overcome this handicap 
she was given various types of training during eighteen weeks. The 
first six weeks were devoted to a great deal of oral reading. The second 
six weeks were spent on drills in phonics and in word analysis. During 
the last six weeks she was given a great deal of silent reading. While 
each period of six weeks thus stressed some one phase of reading, all 
three types of work were carried along throughout the eighteen weeks. 
For example, oral reading was continued with less emphasis during the 
last twelve weeks. 
The selections for oral reading were made along the line of the 
pupil’s school interests in history and geography. These included Bald- 
win’s Fifty Famous Stories and Thirty More Famous Stories, Harding’s 
Story of Europe, Allen’s Industrial Europe, Carpenter’s Europe, “Our 
European Cousins Series,” the Merrill and the Horace Mann Third and 
Fourth Readers, Tappan’s Old World Heroes, Terry’s The New Liberty, 
and Brown’s English History Stories. 
Phonics and word analysis were emphasized during the second six 
weeks. Various systems of phonics, with some modifications to suit the 
particular needs, were used. Words mispronounced in oral-reading 
lessons were worked out phonetically, and lists of words similarly pro- 
nounced were built up and reviewed from time to time. There seemed 
to be a gradual growth in ability to attack an unfamiliar word. In the 
earlier period the pupil frequently looked at the word helplessly or pro- 
nounced a known syllable but was unable to attack it at all phonetically. 
She usually asked the instructor to pronounce it. Later she began im- 
mediately to sound the new word phonetically, and, though sometimes 
making a mistake in the length of the vowel or in the position of the 
accent, her manner of attack indicated that she had confidence in her 
own ability to work it out. 
Silent reading was emphasized during the last six weeks after some 
training in silent reading had been given throughout the first twelve 
weeks. For special training paragraphs or selections dealing with topics 
of particular interest to the pupil were used. In many instances the 
original selections were edited, and the words which had been used in 
the phonic exercises were woven into the text. Frequently before the 
silent reading began a question was raised the answer to which was to 
be found in the text. Oral or written reproduction or a discussion of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-338
  328 THE TEACHING OF READING 
thought of the selection usually followed the reading. It is interesting 
to note in passing that though no effort was made to reduce the vocali- 
zation so perceptible at first it entirely disappeared except when an un- 
usually difficult passage was encountered. 
Results. In the silent- and oral-reading tests given at the close of 
the training period, the pupil showed by her whole manner that she 
felt competent to do the task. She wrote with a precision and directness 
not at all characteristic of her earlier tests. The tests in oral reading 
also showed a gain in rate and a reduction in the number of errors. 
Her teachers report that Case ‘G” reads with much greater ease and 
fluency of expression. The quality of her voice has improved, and the 
nasal tones have almost entirely disappeared. She seems to enjoy 
reading silently much more than before training. Frequently she 
expresses a preference for reading a passage silently, saying, ‘I can do 
it faster.” Her oral reproductions contain many more of the expres- 
sions found in the original passage than formerly. When told that-her 
written work does not include many new words, she said, “Well, I re- 
member them, but I am not always absolutely sure of the spelling, so I 
use a word that means the same.” She now ranks among the upper third 
of her class in ability to read rapidly when reading for the purpose of 
reproducing the thought. 
A SEVENTH-GRADE PUPIL WHO RANKED LOW IN COM- 
PREHENSION BECAUSE OF A SMALL VOCABULARY OF 
MEANINGS? 
Description: Designated Case “E.” Case “E” is that of a seventh- 
grade boy, age 14 years and 10 months when special training began. In 
general school standing he is rated as a poor student, although he is given 
a grade of good (B) in the manual arts, music, and physical training. In 
all other subjects he is poor, taking no part voluntarily in class discus- 
sions. He reads in a dull, monotonous tone, slurring words and phrases, 
and making no attempt to group words into thought units. When asked 
to tell what he has read, he reproduces a few ideas in short, scrappy 
sentences, for apparently he makes few associations as he reads. His

teachers in history and geography explain his poor standing in their sub- 
jects as attributable to an inability to get ideas from the text. He ap- 
parently reads as rapidly silently as any in the class but gets-and retains 
less of the thought. 
In an oral-reading test he read fairly rapidly, pronouncing the words 
mechanically and enunciating poorly. Several periods were eliminated, 
and two adjoining sentences were read as single thoughts. The results 
of a silent-reading test showed that he ranked in comprehension at a 
lower level than the poorest readers in the two preceding grades. This 
result verified the estimates of his teachers of history and geography. 
Diagnosis and problem. Case “E” had acquired a mastery of the” 
rudimentary mechanics of word recognition but lagged far behind in 
the mastery of word meaning. He read words as mere names and not as 
symbols of ideas. How to build up a background of meaning that 
would form a basis for his reading was and still is an urgent and diffi- 
cult problem. 
Remedial lessons. Because of his interest in animal stories and tales 
of camp and pioneer life, emphasis was laid throughout the eighteen 
weeks of special training on literature dealing with these topics. The 
Boy Scouts’ Manual, Custer’s Boots and Saddles, Roosevelt’s Winning 
of the West, Southworth’s Builders of Our Country, Book II, the Merrill 
and the Horace Mann Fourth and Fifth Readers, Burroughs’s Stickeen, 
Coffin’s Boys of ’76, the Thompson Seton and Kipling stories and similar 
literature was drawn upon freely. Silent reading was continued through- 
out the eighteen weeks, but was especially emphasized during the first six 
weeks and again during the last six weeks. After reading a selection the 
pupil reproduced it orally or in writing. These reproductions at first 
were so meager and inadequate that he frequently had to re-read several 
times before he could answer the questions raised. Many selections were 
read in this way, paragraph by paragraph, and the main points jotted 
down to assist in the organization of the thought. 
Before the work had progressed very far it became apparent that 
definite word study was necessary in order to build up a background of 
meaning. Words were studied in the context for meaning, and certain 
ones were chosen for detailed analysis of prefix, suffix, and stem. A 
stem word analyzed in this manner became the nucleus for grouping 
together other closely related words more or less familiar to the student. 
The word “traction” encountered in an article on the “Lincoln High- 
way” brought out a discussion of traction engines, their use in plowing, 
road-building, and trench warfare, why so called, etc. This centered 
ie, 
  
 
-P-A-G-E-340
330 THE TEACHING OF READING 
attention upon the stem “‘tract.” As its meaning became clear the fol- 
lowing list was elaborated : 
subtract distract attraction 
contract extract distraction 
detract retract subtraction 
attract contraction extraction 
A study of the prefixes in these words gave a point of leverage for at- 
tacking the meaning of words containing them. In this type of prefix 
study only those words were listed whose stems were familiar to the 
pupil, as, for example : 
recall rebound retake 
reclaim retain reinforce 
rearrange reform return 
regain remake reframe, etc. 
In a similar manner an acquaintance was made with the most common 
suffixes. 
The meaning of some words was approached by the study of 
synonyms and equivalent idiomatic phrases. These were, as far as 
possible, studied in the context and discussed at length to bring out 
shades of difference in meaning. “An indomitable hero” met in the 
pioneer tales brought forth the following synonyms and idiomatic 
phrases : 
indomitable fearless stout-hearted 
brave heroic intrepid 
courageous bold audacious 
resolute daring defiant 
manly plucky undismayed 
to look danger in the face 
to screw one’s courage to the sticking-point 
to take the bull by the horns 
to beard the lion in his den 
to put on a bold front 
This type of intensive word study was continued throughout the 
first six weeks but was supplemented by incidental word study during 
the remaining twelve weeks. 
Oral reading was given special attention during the second six weeks 
and continued during the following six weeks. The literature was of the     
-P-A-G-E-341
  SPECIAL HELP TO BACKWARD PUPILS 382 
     
    same general type as that used in silent reading. The purpose was to 
improve, if possible, enunciation and expression. Specia! drills in the 
enunciation of vowels and of the terminal and initial consonants were 
a part of each reading lesson. Many of these drills were taken from 
reading books. Selections were studied silently before being read aloud 
nd the meaning discussed. The various thought units were marked off 
ad the whole selection was then read aloud. Before the close of each 
‘son the pupil read a selection at sight, unaided by this kind of 
paration.

amary of examples. The foregoing pages have reported 
sme length a number of examples of the application of 
edial devices of instruction to special cases of backward- 
ss. The special cases referred to follow: 
1. A fluent oral reader who comprehended nothing read 
ilently. 
2. A second-grade child who could not read primer material. 
3. A child who repeated in oral reading. 
4. A foreign child who was handicapped in his third-grade 
reading because of meager vocabulary. 
5. A fifth-grade pupil who read slowly because he recognized 
in very small units of fixation. 
6. A fifth-grade pupil who read slowly because of word dif- 
ficulties. 
7. A seventh-grade pupil who ranked low in comprehension 
because of a small vocabulary of meanings. 
The value of organizing special forms of help to meet indi- 
vidual needs impresses itself upon the reader of the foregoing 
illustrations. The readiness of the response of the backward 
pupil when he is given the kind of help he needs characterizes 
the results in every case. The progress noted is the most strik-

  ing feature of each report. The reports are intended to demon- 
strate the need of special help for backward pupils, the means 
of diagnosis, the methods of remedial instruction, and the re- 
sults one may expect when remedial instruction is thoughtfully 
organized and wisely administered. 
Sometimes special instruction must introduce regular in- 
struction. There is another reason for including in our discus- 
sion a number of reports of successful efforts to alleviate the 
difficulties of pupils in a variety of cases. It is not infrequently 
the circumstance in the various grades of a school that the back- 
ward pupil is the rule and not the exception. Instead of two or, 
three pupils of a grade being unable to respond to the regul: 
course of instruction, it sometimes happens that the who 
grade is backward and the entire school is running behin 
schedule. The writer recalls a four-room school in which h 
gave tests to determine the silent-reading abilities of the pupils. 
He found the pupils of the fifth grade to be just as good silent 
readers as the pupils of the sixth and seventh grades; or, to use 
language that is more exact, he found the sixth-grade and 
seventh-grade pupils to be just as poor silent readers as the 
pupils of the fifth grade. That is to say, no advancement in 
ability to get meaning from print had been made from the fifth 
to the seventh grade. The writer, in May, 1921, tested the 
silent-reading ability of fifty-one “graduates” of the eighth 
grade who had assembled from a number of schools. These 
pupils were “prepared,” as indicated by their “graduation” 
from the eighth grade, to enter the freshman class of the high 
school. Their median score was slightly below the standard 
score for sixth-grade pupils. Too often pupils—not individ- 
ually, but in groups—enter the second and third grades un- 
able to read primer material; whole classes are moved ahead 
into the intermediate grades without having mastered the 
difficulties of the mechanics; they enter the upper grades, even 
the high school, without ever having had an opportunity to 
broaden their experience through extensive silent reading.

  SPECIAL HELP TO BACKWARD PUPILS — 333 
How shall the reading teacher, trained in the methods suited 
to pupils at their various stages of progress through the grades, 
seek to administer the course of study in reading as outlined in 
Chapters XI-XVI when confronted by a roomful of backward 
pupils? The answer is clear. The teacher must of necessity 
delay the regular instruction until the pupils have been pre- 
pared, through various types of special instruction, to profit by 
it. His task is, first, to move the pupils forward in the direction 
of the standard abilities set for their grades; next, to attempt 
only such regular instruction as the developing abilities of the 
pupils will permit them to receive. To this end the forego- 
ing examples of the administration of remedial instruction to 
special cases of backwardness offer a number of valuable sugges- 
tions, as follows: (1) the abilities of the pupils should be meas- 
ured; (2) their individual points of difficulty and of failure 
should be discovered and classified; (3) their various types of 
backwardness should be diagnosed; (4) special forms of reme- 
dial instruction should be planned for each type; (5) the pupils 
should be grouped into special classes and instructed according 
to the special needs of each group; and (6) their progress 
should be tested from time to time. Let us consider how the 
teacher may follow these suggestions. 
Suggestion I: The abilities of the pupils should be measured. 
Upon taking charge of the instruction in reading of a grade or 
group of grades, the teacher should proceed immediately to 
the task of determining the standing of each pupil in the sub- 
ject. The teacher should know first of all how well each pupil 
can read orally and how well silently. The reading periods of 
the first week of school may very well be spent.in giving tests 
in the two kinds of reading, though the pupils do not need to 
be made aware of the fact that they are being “tested.” The 
work of testing may proceed as follows: 
In oral reading: For the pupils of each grade choose three 
paragraphs for oral reading—one from their reader of two years 
ago, one from last year’s reader, and one from their reader of
-P-A-G-E-344
  334 THE TEACHING OF READING 
this year. The first paragraph should be very easy ; the second, 
easy ; and the third, of average difficulty. Test the pupils indi- 
vidually in a quiet place where they will be free from distrac- 
tion and where the remainder of the pupils to be tested will not 
hear the reading. Whén_ everything is in readiness show the 
first paragraph to the pupil and say: “I should like you to read 
this paragraph for me. If you should find some hard words, 
read them as best you can without help and continue reading. 
Begin when I say ‘ Begin.’” Hand him the book and say 
“Begin.” When the pupil has finished show him the next para- 
graph, and so on. Keep a record of the time taken to read each 
paragraph and of the number and kinds of errors, as indicated :

Time (in seconds). . 
Mispronunciations .

  In silent reading (for pupils in the third grade and beyond) : 
For the pupils of each grade choose a short, interesting, but 
unfamiliar story from their text or from a supplementary 
reader. Prepare ten questions which seem to you to bring out 
the essential points in the story. Prepare questions that can be 
answered by “Yes” or “No” or by definite words in the selec- 
tion. When everything is in readiness give the pupils the fol- 
lowing directions: “Turn to the story on page—. Keep the 
place with your fingers and close books. This story is called 
———. When I give the signal open books and read the story 
silently. Read the story through without stopping to repeat any
-P-A-G-E-345
  s 
SPECIAL HELP TO BACKWARD PUPILS 335 
ofit. Read the story rapidly but carefully. Do not stop to ask 
questions. Be prepared to tell the story when you are through. 
Open books. Begin.” At the end of one minute say: “Stop; 
mark with your pencil the word last read. Read on till you 
have finished the story.” When the pupils have finished have 
them write answers to the ten questions which you have placed 
upon the board and kept covered until now. 
After the questions are answered have the pupils count the 
words they read in the first minute, exchange books, and verify 
each other’s counts. 
Repeat the exercise two or three times, each time with a 
different story and with different questions. The results ob- 
tained at the third or fourth trial will be more reliable than 
those obtained at the first for the reason that the children will 
understand better what you desire them to do. 
Score the answers to the ten questions, marking each entirely 
right or entirely wrong, and tabulate the results obtained in both 
speed and comprehension. The following form is suggested : 
Rate 1n Worps QuEstions ANSWERED 
PER Minute Per Cent Purtts’ Names 
  Suggestion II: Points of difficulty and of failure should be 
discovered and classified. The teacher now, at the close of the 
first week of school, has a measure of each pupil’s ability in 
both oral and silent reading. For convenience all scores should 
be tabulated on one sheet:

336 THE TEACHING OF READING 
Under the heading “Special Difficulties” the teacher should 
summarize into a single statement the special weaknesses of 
each pupil; for example: “Good in oral—poor in silent”; 
“Slow silent reader—mispronounces”; ‘ Rapid—neglects 
thought”; etc. In a discussion of the use of tests in silent read- 
ing, Bolenius offers some suggestions that are pertinent: 
A great range of individual variation at the end of the year would be 
a sign of inefficient teaching, because it would show that the teacher 
did not correct the deficiencies in the class. At the beginning of the 
year, however, it would serve to diagnose the weaknesses of the class. 
A test shows who need the drill work, and therefore limits drill for 
a definite purpose. When a pupil is up to the standard there is no reason 
for requiring this drill work of him; the time should be put on some- 
thing more valuable for him. Concentrate on the ones who need the 
drill. The tests will show you which pupils need to work for speed and 
which need training in grasping the content (or ideas), because they are 
superficial readers. If a child reads fast at the sacrifice of ideas, he 
must be “slowed up” and by questioning be taught to get the ideas. 
The teacher should average the individual scores and ascertain the 
class score in speed to see whether it is up to the standard. 
Intelligent use of tests will usually break a class into three groups : 
(1) slow readers who need to be speeded up; (2) superficial readers 
who need training in digging out the thought ; and (3) normal readers, 
excused from these drills and privileged to take up profitable and en- 
joyable outside reading. This last group should be made the nucleus of 
a classroom Reading Club, to which those in the other groups are 
eligible as soon as they come up to the standard.* 
The following standards for silent reading are suggested: 
Rate ConTENT 
Grade IV 160 words a minute 
Grade V 180 words a minute 50 per cent of the 
Grade VI 220 words a minute ideas in a 400-word 
Grade VII 250 words a minute passage # 
Grade VIII 280 words a minute

-P-A-G-E-347
  SPECIAL HELP TO BACKWARD PUPILS 337 
The pupils who have made the most mistakes in the oral- 
reading tests and those who rank lowest in the silent-reading 
tests should be placed in a group by themselves for special 
attention. 
Suggestion III: Various types of backwardness should be 
diagnosed. Under the heading “Diagnosis,” in the foregoing 
table, the teacher should state for each backward pupil his 
particular cause of failure. These statements should result 
from a close, individual examination and study of each case of 
backwardness. For example, if a pupil is a slow reader, the 
teacher should discover whether he is slow because he has diffi- 
culty in recognizing words, or because he recognizes in too 
small units of fixation, or merely because he is slow by tempera- 
ment. If a pupil has trouble in getting meaning, is the fault due 
to the lack of mastery of mechanics or to the lack of a suffi- 
cient vocabulary of meanings? It may be due to the fact that 
the pupil merely lacks practice in reading for meaning, or it 
may be due to the fact that the pupil reads words as names and 
not as symbols of ideas. The teacher should seek out the cause. 
Why does the pupil repeat? because he fails to get a satisfac- 
tory amount of meaning at the first reading or because he is not 
sure of the words when he reads? 
When such a study has been made of each case of backward- 
ness, and the diagnosis recorded, the teacher’s record under the 
headings “Special Difficulties” and “Diagnosis” would read 
somewhat as follows: 
SpeciaL DIFFICULTIES Dracnosis 
Slow silent reader Small unit of fixation 
Poor in thought-getting Merely pronounces the words 
Poor in thought-getting Small vocabulary of meanings 
Very slow Many word difficulties 
Repeats—gets no meaning Does not phrase properly 
Reads haltingly, etc. No knowledge of how to attack 
new words, etc.
-P-A-G-E-348
  338 THE TEACHING OF READING 
Suggestion IV: Remedial instruction should be planned for 
each type of backwardness. A review of the examples in the 
early part of this chapter of the application of remedial devices 
of instruction to special cases of backwardness will indicate the 
procedure to be followed in carrying out this suggestion. This 
suggestion follows in the natural course the three which pre- 
cede. When the teacher has measured the abilities of his pupils, 
discovered their special weaknesses and failings, and has diag- 
nosed each case to determine the cause of backwardness, his 
next task is to plan the sort of remedial instruction which in 
each case will remove the cause of failure. 
Suggestion V: The pupils should be grouped into special 
classes and instructed according to the needs of each group. 
The teacher is now ready to proceed to the organization of his 
special classes. Pupils A, B, C, and D are placed in Class I for 
special instruction in “reading for content”; E and F are as- 
signed to Class II for special instruction in “word recognition, 
word analysis, phonics”; Class III, in “phrasing of sentences,” 
is organized for A, C, G, and H; Class IV is organized to give 
pupils G, I, and J special drill in “phrase recognition”; and 
Class V, in “meanings of words,” is started to accommodate 
pupils K, L, M, and N. A place in the program is made for the 
special classes, and each class is scheduled to meet on its desig- 
nated day once each week. Thus the regularly organized classes 
in reading are permitted to proceed each day without interrup- 
tion, while extra instruction for five special types of backward- 
ness is provided for fourteen pupils. The foregoing plan is, 
suggestive of the scope and variety special instruction may take 
without serious hindrance to the smooth running of the regular 
school program. Indeed, the special instruction may rightly 
be considered a part of the regular program. 
Suggestion VI: The progress of the pupils should be tested 
from time to time. The importance of this suggestion is to be 
noted in the following discussion by Bolenius on the service of 
tests in “appealing to class pride”: 
 
-P-A-G-E-349
  SPECIAL HELP TO BACKWARD PUPILS 339 
The children will be interested in checking up their own scores to 
see how they are improving. Urge them to “beat” their own records. 
Let them know exactly what the standard for speed is for their grade, 
and let them know that to get all the thoughts of a selection it is neces- 
sary to read the selection several times. The questions given for the 
formal tests deal with very patent things in the selection, things that be- 
long to the 50 per cent of the ideas that should be grasped at first reading. 
Let committees of children ascertain the class average and post it 
prominently, month by month, in the classroom. Thus the monthly 
record will loom large as a class achievement. It is well for classes of 
the same grade to compare scores. 
Special groups that are drilling for speed or content should be put 
through five-minute drills daily and a close watch kept on their im- 
provement. Great zeal may be developed if the teacher is wise enough 
to take the children into her confidence and let them know what they 
are trying to do. A boy can be made to see, therefore, in concrete 
terms, that the careful analytical discussion of short passages is im- 
proving his ability to grasp the thought, for his improvement in scores 
from 200/ D to 170/B shows that his superficiality in reading is giving 
way to’ thoughtfulness, even if the reading is a little slower.* 
Informal testing, such as described under Suggestion I, should 
be carried on throughout the year. By such means a motive is 
given the pupils for their class work, greater effort is thus en- 
couraged through the appeal of objective scores that the pupils 
can understand, and the teacher is thereby enabled to judge of 
the effectiveness of his instruction and to modify it from time 
to time to accord with the changing needs of his pupils. The 
need of continued diagnosis and the importance of informal 
testing as a means of diagnosis can hardly be overstated. 
Many teachers make use of formal, standardized tests for 
purposes of diagnosis and of measuring the progress of pupils. 
Such tests offer the advantage of more accurate results than 
those to be secured by informal tests, and the disadvantage of 
being limited in usefulness, for the reason that once given they 
are of no value as testing material until the pupils have for-

a. Monroe’s “Standardized Silent Reading Tests.” Public School 
Publishing Company, Bloomington, Illinois. 
b. Burgess’s “Scales for Measuring Ability in Silent Reading.” Pub- 
lication Department, Russell Sage Foundation, New York City. 
Printed directions for giving the test, scoring the papers, and 
tabulating the results accompany each set of testing material. 
Before deciding to give one of the tests the teacher should secure 
from the publisher a sample copy of the testing material and of 
the printed directions, record sheets, etc. The study of a good 
general discussion of reading tests is to be recommended. Many 
helpful suggestions may be found in such books as the fol- 
lowing:

Voss, and F. J. Kelly. Houghton Mifflin Company, Boston, 1917.

  SPECIAL HELP TO BACKWARD PUPILS 341 
How to Measure, by G. M. Wilson and K. J. Hoke. The Macmillan 
Company, New York, 1920. 
Summary. The chapter opens with a discussion of the im- 
portance of organizing remedial forms of instruction for pupils 
who are backward in reading. The fact that the remedy for 
each case of backwardness should be devised and administered 
according to the special individual needs that exist was selected 
as a topic for explicit consideration and emphasis. For this 
purpose some typical examples of the application of remedial 
devices of instruction to special cases of backwardness were 
reported at length. The chapter closed with a summary of 
suggestions for the organization of special help. These are: 
1. The abilities of the pupils should be measured. 
2. Points of difficulty and of failure should be discovered and 
classified. 
3. Various types of backwardness should be diagnosed. 
4. Remedial instruction should be planned for each type of 
backwardness. 
5. The pupils should be grouped into special classes and in- 
structed according to the needs of each group. 
6. The progress of the pupils should be tested from time to 
time.

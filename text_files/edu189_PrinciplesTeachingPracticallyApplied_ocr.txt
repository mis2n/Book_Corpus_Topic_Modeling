EDITOR’S INTRODUCTION 
Tue present volume in this series is an attempt, 
by a very successful trainer of teachers, to organ- 
ize the more important types of concrete experi- 
ences and practices and procedures of the class- 
room under certain fundamental psychological 
and pedagogical principles, and to show how 
these principles apply in the daily work of the 
classroom teacher in the elementary school. The 
volume in consequence is concrete and applied in 
character, and is primarily addressed to the stu- 
dent in training and to the teacher in service. Its 
character is such that it should find its greatest 
field of usefulness with the training class and in 
the Teachers’ Reading Circles of our States. 
The author of this volume has had a wide and 
an unusually successful experience as a trainer of 
student teachers in state normal schools, and as a 
superintendent of instruction in city schools, and 
writes from the background of her experiences in 
initiating beginning teachers, and those lacking 
in teaching technique, into the art of teaching 
well. The volume ought, by reason of this funda- 
mental foundation in sound theory and classroom 
experience, to prove very helpful to many young 
teachers desirous of perfecting their classroom 
technique.

  PREFACE 
Ir has been the intention in this book so to sim- 
plify educational principles that any teacher may 
by thoughtful study recognize the principles and 
apply them in her own procedure. 
The writer has made a study for several years 
of the problems of the elementary-school teacher, 
and has met the practical situations as they occur 
day by day in the classroom. As an instructor in 
Teachers’ Colleges and Universities, as a super- 
visor of instruction in city schools, and as a di- 
rector of Training Schools, she knows the prob- 
lems which seem to perplex the classroom teacher, 
and which demand the greatest study for a satis- 
factory solution. 
She has attempted in this volume to assemble 
the results of her study and experience, with the 
hope that through the teachers it may contribute 
to the welfare of the girls and boys. 
The author wishes gratefully to acknowledge 
the influence of the many instructors whose sym- 
pathetic teaching has been the inspiration for the 
moulding of her opinions. Whatever of good the 
book may contain is largely due to their influence, 
but she would not wish them to be accredited with 
its shortcomings. She wishes, also, to acknowl-
-P-A-G-E-10
= PREFACE 
edge the helpful influence and codperation of the 
many teachers and co-workers whose ideas may 
have found place in this volume. 
  The progressive teacher is eagerly seeking to 
analyze her procedure that she may ascertain the 
elements of strength and weakness and benefit 
thereby. Often this introspection is not condu- 
cive to growth, because the various educational 
principles which contribute to success are not 
clearly defined in terms of practical classroom 
procedure. 
The inexperienced teacher, fresh from the Nor- 
mal School, is sometimes inclined to be vague 
in the application of well-remembered theories, 
while the experienced teacher is in danger of over- 
confidence in her own theories, gradually losing 
sight of the vision which is necessary to an open- 
minded attitude. 
It is the purpose of this book to name va- 
rious educational principles which experience has 
proved to be essential, to justify the selection 
from the standpoint of child psychology, and to 
illustrate their use by concrete cases from class- 
room procedure. 
The author has purposely tried to avoid the- 
oretical discussions and technical terminology 
which might be a cause of confusion to the in- 
experienced reader. In so far as it is necessary to
-P-A-G-E-11
  
PREFACE xi 
base conclusions upon psychological foundations, 
results of experimentation and research will be 
discussed without entering into a description of 
such investigations. 
Many educational writers have approached the 
field of teaching from the standpoint of theory. 
This view alone is not sufficient. The teacher 
needs help in making the application. Other 
writers have emphasized teaching from the par- 
ticular angle of the subject-matter involved. 
This important element should not be neglected. 
( The qualified specialist in each subject has a val- 
uable contribution to offer, but the teacher needs 
to be able to see the principle more clearly in order 
to appreciate this particular emphasis. 
It is the purpose in this volume to consider the 
items of skill in which a teacher may improve, and 
to aid in a personal application by citing par- 
ticular cases where the principle is involved and 
where successful adaptation has been attained. 
Helpful as a sympathetic supervisor may be, 
much really depends upon the wise self-criticism 
with which the honest teacher faces her task. At 
the close of any recitation, a review of the prin- 
ciples here suggested should enable the thought- 
ful teacher to analyze her procedure and plan 
specific methods of improvement. No one recita- 
tion need include all of the principles listed, nor 
should they be considered as separate entities to
-P-A-G-E-12
  xii PREFACE 
be classified and pigeonholed for use at stated 
times. Obviously the continuous nature of sub- 
ject-matter and of the learning process would 
preclude any such possibility. It is, neverthe- 
less, by constant attention to these various ele- 
ments that the teacher becomes an artist in her 
chosen profession. 
While the book is meant to be practical, it is 
intended no less to be scientific. The scientific 
basis is assumed rather than discussed at length. 
In so far as reasons are needed, they are included 
for the sake of clarifying the principle involved. 
The author does not claim originality for the 
principles defined. It has been by an extensive 
study of all available contributions in the field, 
and by a careful organization in the light of va- 
ried and extended experience, that the book has 
been planned. It is hoped that it may serve to 
inspire the classroom teacher to renewed effort by 
making educational principles more meaningful; 
and that it may be the means of enriching the 
teacher’s joy in her work by a realization of what 
she is doing and why she is doing it.

CHAPTER I 
DETERMINATION OF AIMS 
The teacher’s privilege. Since the education of 
its youth is the best investment that a nation can 
make, the teacher occupies an important position 
in the scheme of society. Upon her rests the re- 
sponsibility of understanding, appreciating, and 
guiding these future citizens. The teacher of to- 
day needs to be aware of the educational tend- 
encies of the times, and should determine her 
aims in the light of the most advanced profes- 
sional knowledge. The progressive teacher, too, 
will realize that the needs of a democracy require 
many changes in our current educational thought 
and practice. 
What, then, are some of these needs? What 
should be expected of our girls and boys as they 
assume the responsibilities of life? In the first 
place, they should be able to appreciate and wisely 
use the vast heritage which is theirs from the past. 
To be merely a receiver of benefits is not the goal 
sought in a democracy; rather to receive in order
-P-A-G-E-16
  PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING APPLIED 2 
to share is the spirit which maintains an equitable 
social structure. The child should acquire in 
order to produce. He should early learn that 
service of some kind is his only justification 
among his fellows. 
General aims. 
needs of society is i ile this forward look to the 
portant, the teacher should 
not feel that her only aim is to prepare the child 
for the future. The appreciation and use of his 
social heritage involves not only a knowledge of 
the past, with its accumulation of facts; it also 
implies the acquisition of certain habits and skills 
e. Attitudes and purposes 
are important in det 
tribution to society i 
ers, yet the type of c: 
to democracy must in the use of vind 
rmining what a pupil’s con- 
to be. All cannot be lead- 
itizenship which is essential 
clude an acceptance of in- i 
telligent leadership and a willingness to codperate 
for the common good. 
The teacher’s aims, then, must be formulated 
with the twofold purpose of furnishing the child 
that experience which will contribute to his growth 
in knowledge, skills, habits, attitudes, and pur- 
. poses, which in their turn will contribute to the 
welfare of society. The two purposes are not 
unrelated; they are, instead, different aspects of 
the same situation. 
If the citizen of to-morrow is to be a thinking, 
\ purposeful individual, able to contribute to his  
-P-A-G-E-17
DETERMINATION OF AIMS 8 
( own happiness and to the welfare of society, the 
| child of to-day must be given an opportunity for 
experiences which will develop in him the power of 
active, intelligent adaptation to situations as they 
occur, and an increasing ability in planning his 
\own procedure. 
~ Specific aims. Besides such general aims, 
which recognize life’s conditions and needs and 
relate the school situation to the desired goal, the 
teacher should also have specific aims which take 
into consideration the grade which she is teach- 
ing, the age of the children, and the particular 
subject-matter which is appropriate. A still finer 
discrimination in specific aims will enable the 
teacher to select the particular problem, the par- 
ticular method or device, and the amount of time 
io be allowed for a definite division of work. In fact, the more definite the teacher can be in de- 
termining specific aims, the more certain is she of 
accomplishing the desired ends. These specific 
aims serve as definite goals toward which to work, 
and as criteria for judging achievement. 
Aims illustrated. For example, a 5-B teacher 
selected the following aims for a first lesson in 
teaching common fractions. 
1. General aims: 
1. To enable the pupils to grasp the significance 
of arithmetic in their own lives. 
2. To help pupils to appreciate number situa-
-P-A-G-E-18
4 PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING APPLIED 
tions in which common fractions are a neces- 
sary tool. 
8. To develop an attitude of interest in school’ 
work, accompanied by respect for teacher and 
classmates; and an attitude of interest toward 
the commercial world in which operations in- 
volving fractions form a necessary element. 
4. To enable pupils to gain a breadth of view, 
business information, and business experience, 
to the limits of child ability. 
: 5. To encourage desirable purposes: 
a. Accuracy in details. 
b. Honesty in methods of work. 
c. Use of arithmetic to meet daily needs. 
6. To foster useful habits: 
. a. Intellectual-motor habits: speed, accu- 
racy, and clear thinking. 
b. Socially desirable habits: courtesy and 
couperation. 
c. Physical habits: correct posture, care of 
eyes, and avoidance of chalkdust. 
2. Specific aims: 
1. To enable pupils to understand the process in 
addition of fractions. 
2. To furnish practice in the arrangement and 
solution of simple problems having a common 
denominator. 
8. To secure interest by: 
-a. Having pupils list purchases which re- 
quire fractions in computing measure- 
ments or costs. 
b. Varying the procedure by permitting 
pupils to work first at the blackboard, 
and then at the desks. 
ce. Creating friendly rivalry between girls 
and boys, or between sections. 
d. Setting a time limit for the solution of
-P-A-G-E-19
DETERMINATION OF AIMS 5 
problems, after the process has been care- 
fully explained and understood. 
4. To provide for individual differences by oral 
explanations, use of blackboard, pupil partici- 
pation in demonstration, and variety in com 
crete illustrations. 
A study of these aims reveals the fact that this 
teacher realized the importance of relating school 
work to the life of the pupils, and recognized her 
responsibility in developing correct ideals, habits, 
attitudes, and purposes. 
Specific methods for attaining these desired 
ends are, to a great extent, a matter of personality, 
and are dependent upon particular elements in 
the local situation. The “preaching” teacher 
sometimes antagonizes rather than inspires. To 
point out tactfully success or failure, due to the 
presence or lack of the specific purpose desired, 
is often the means of establishing that purpose as 
a new goal for the child. As the building of char- 
acter is a cumulative process, it is not easy to 
specify a given element to be acquired in a par- 
ticular recitation. Much can be accomplished 
toward this end by the teacher’s attitude and 
example. 
It should not be assumed that the acquisition 
of correct habits in the solution of arithmetical 
problems will insure correct habits in all of life’s 
problems. Psychological experimentation has 
proved that such transfer of training cannot be
-P-A-G-E-20
  6 PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING APPLIED 
expected. Neither should the teacher become 
confused, and lose sight of the intrinsic function 
of arithmetic, which is to enable people to compre- 
hend and handle numbers for the accomplish- 
ment of specific purposes. It is, however, im- 
portant that, while endeavoring to make arith- 
metic less academic and more practical, she should 
realize that every school situation is indirectly an 
opportunity for the acquisition of ideals which 
are far-reaching in their consequences. 
Importance of specific aims. A very common 
fault of beginning and of unsuccessful teachers is 
to have general aims in mind, but to have failed-in 
formulating specific aims. Such a teacher may be 
likened to a captain of a ship who decides upon a 
given country to which he will sail, but does not 
select a definite port at which to land, or make 
specific arrangements for the necessary naviga- 
tion charts and instruments, for provisions during 
the voyage, for repairs which may be needed, or 
for numerous emergencies which may occur. 
_Economy in the learning process demands that 
too much is not attempted at one time, and that 
correct impressions are gained at first; conse- 
quently the teacher should plan to make this in- 
troductory lesson a challenge to the pupil’s in- 
terest and effort, not from the standpoint of 
amount of work attempted, but of the quality of 
work done. The pupil will need the habit of con-
-P-A-G-E-21
  DETERMINATION OF AIMS @ 
centrated attention that the new process may be 
understood. Means of holding his attention have 
been planned. Experimentation has proved that 
variety in procedure tends to secure an attitude of 
interest. 
Specific aims should always take account of in- 
dividual differences in the pupils, and provide for 
the conditions which the particular situation sug- 
gests. Even the most casual observation of a 
group of children will reveal wide differences in 
disposition, in interests, and in abilities. A little 
careful study will enable the teacher to see that in 
almost any group there will be some pupils who 
will learn more readily by the use of visual im- 
agery; others are especially helped by auditory 
imagery; while still others gain impressions most 
quickly through kinesthetic imagery. It is not 
that any one pupil uses one kind of imagery to the 
exclusion of the others, but, since any one group 
shows such wide variations, and since the past 
experiences and the interests of the pupils are so 
varied, the teacher should plan to present explana- 
tions and require responses in a variety of forms 
to meet the needs of a more or less heterogeneous 
group. 
A second illustration of aims. A teacher 
selected the following aims for a fourth-grade 
geography lesson. The lesson extended over two 
recitation periods, of thirty minutes each.
-P-A-G-E-22
  8 PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING APPLIED 
1. General aims: 
1. To awaken a keener appreciation of a life in- 
terest — clothing. 
a. To teach man’s dependence upon en- 
vironment. 
2. To guide in the acquisition of certain informa- 
tional facts in the geography of the Southern 
States. 
2. Specific aims: 
1. To arouse and stimulate interest in problem 
solving. 
2. To guide in the acquisition of proper habits of 
study. 
a. Choice of problem. 
b. Formation of outline for study. 
ce. Responsibility of individual. 
d. How to use text. 
e. Value of outside references. 
f. Increasing vocabulary. 
“Of what kind of material is your dress made, 
Margaret?” ... “If you could visit every school- 
room in this city, how many children do you 
think you might find who are wearing clothing 
made of cotton?” 
By a series of similar questions the teacher 
aroused interest in the materials from which the 
pupils’ clothing was made, and developed the 
realization that cotton is used extensively over a 
wide area. 
“Where does so much cotton come from, 
Homer?” 
The pupils know that it comes from “down 
 
-P-A-G-E-23
DETERMINATION OF AIMS 9 
South,” but a few more searching questions make 
them realize that their knowledge is limited. 
“How many would like to know more about 
it?” ... “Open your geography texts to page 346, 
Figure 315.” ...‘‘Here is a picture that tells a 
story about cotton. Each little square repre- 
sents a country. Who can tell which square 
represents our country?” 
This question, coming after interest has been 
aroused, serves to put the class in the proper at- 
titude. It appeals through intellectual curiosity 
and visual imagery, and demonstrates the prin- 
ciple of vividness. The teacher here begins to 
teach the use and interpretation of graphic por- 
trayal of significant facts. 
A pupil asks: “Why do you suppose the United 
States is represented by such a large square?” 
Various reasons are suggested by the pupils, each 
one of which is discussed and evaluated until the 
class as a whole agrees that the United States 
raises more cotton than any other country. 
“Does our picture tell us anything more about 
cotton?” 
This is the first of a series of questions aimed to 
stimulate pupils to collect all the data from this 
diagram. ‘They are then cited to a paragraph 
which includes this statement: ‘More than one 
half of all of the cotton raised in the world is 
grown in our Southern States.”  
-P-A-G-E-24
  10 PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING APPLIED 
Formulation of the problem. The pupils have 
been led from an immediate interest in their own 
clothing to a real problem of life interest, which a 
pupil states: 
“Why does most of the cotton used in the 
world come from our Southern States?” 
The pupils were then given an opportunity to 
suggest how to solve the problem. By allowing 
the class to decide which of the suggested ways 
were best, the teacher gave opportunity for evalu- 
ation, initiative, and responsibility. 
The pupils were then encouraged to suggest 
items in an outline for study. 
“What do you think is the first thing we shall want 
to know before we can solve our problem?” 
Pupil: “We shall want to know where the Southern 
States are.” 
Teacher: “What word do you use when you speak of 
where a place is?” 
“What shall we call the first point in the outline?” 
The teacher thus begins the realization of two 
aims: the making of an outline for study, and in- 
creasing the pupils’ vocabulary. The following 
questions and answers illustrate the same aims: 
“We were talking about industries and occupations 
the other day. Which one of the occupations studied 
has any relation to our problem?” ... “What do we 
call the occupation that deals with raising things from 
the soil?” 
“Farming.”
-P-A-G-E-25
DETERMINATION OF AIMS Il 
“Who knows another word that means the same?” 
“ Asriculture.” 
“We shall place both words in our outline to help us 
to remember them.” 
This procedure is continued until the following 
outline is completed: 
I. Location. 
II. Agriculture or Farming. 
A. Climate. 
1. Rain. 
2. Temperature. 
B. Soil. 
C. Surface. 
Extension of the aim. Having aroused interest 
in the life interest — clothing; having stimulated 
the pupils to state a problem, and form an outline 
for study; and having throughout the lesson en- 
couraged a feeling of responsibility in each mem- 
ber of the class, the teacher was then ready to in- 
troduce still another aim: how to use the textbook. 
By a series of questions she developed the idea of 
using maps to locate States, use of index to find 
map, how to use index, and how and when to use 
reference books, which she had provided for the 
occasion. A brief practice in finding items in the 
index, and subsequent passages in the text, was 
given before the teacher felt that her aims for 
that lesson had been accomplished. 
In the following recitation period the pupils 
reported the information gained during their
-P-A-G-E-26
12 PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING APPLIED 
study period. The problematic situation fur- 
nished the best stimulus for reflective thinking, 
and pupils were frequently encouraged to refer to 
the problem in order that the specific purpose 
might be kept in mind. The outline served as a 
guide in the collection of data; also as a standard 
whereby data were evaluated. The pupils were 
held responsible for a share in the discussion and 
for constructive criticism, thus acquiring a feeling 
of responsibility as members of a social group. 
Careful attention was paid to the physical wel- 
fare of the pupils, and to securing and holding at- 
tention by avoiding distracting conditions. Care 
was taken throughout that the disposition or men 
tal set was conducive to good work, and that an 
inspiring and sympathetic atmosphere should 
exist in the school. While these aims are im- 
portant, they are more or less subconscious to the 
skillful, experienced teacher. No one who is re- 
sponsible for pupil progress can afford to neglect 
their importance. 
Having determined both general and specific 
aims for a given recitation, the teacher has started 
toward a mastery of the situation. She has es- 
tablished guide-posts which will enable her to 
keep her direction, and to a certain extent meas- 
ure the distance gained. Having determined 
what she wishes to accomplish, she must then 
decide how to attain these aims.

EDUCATIONAL PRINCIPLES INVOLVED IN 
THE FOREGOING DISCUSSION 
1. The chief concern of a democracy should be education, 
which will provide opportunity for the desirable changes 
in conduct that constitute growth. 
2. The schools should furnish opportunity for those ex- 
periences which will develop in the child the power of 
active, intelligent adaptation to society, with a feeling 
of responsibility for service. 
8. The teacher’s success depends in Jarge measure upon 
her ability to analyze the purposes of education, to de- 
termine the particular needs of each pupil, and to select 
her aims accordingly. 
4. Specific aims should provide for the selection of appro- 
priate subject-matter and method, should define limi- 
tations in amounts and kinds, and should enable the 
teacher to check her own progress, and that of her pu- 
pils, toward specific goals. 
5. The teacher’s achievement will depend upon her ability 
to relate school work to the life interests of the growing 
child at the present time, with a recognition of the 
claims of society in the future. 
6. The teacher should recognize in each recitation the op- 
portunity to guide in the acquisition of high ideals of 
conduct, as well as definite informational facts and 
necessary skills. 
%. The subject-matter selected for any recitation should be 
within the pupil’s comprehension, suited to his partic- 
ular need at a given time, of practical social value, and 
adapted to the time limits of the recitation. 
8. The teacher’s method should be selected with regard to 
the laws of learning. It should show a recognition of 
the importance of concentrated attention based upon 
interest, accurate first impressions, variety in proced- 
ure, and making work concrete. 
9. Since the schoolroom is the most extensive social sphere 
of the child, he should there learn social, or group, re- 
sponsibility which involves initiative and ability to 
evaluate.

  PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING APPLIED 
Problem-solving provides opportunity for the exercise 
of the main elements of good thinking. A pupil’s 
statement of the problem in concise language is a good 
test of comprehension, and tends to emphasize the 
reality of the situation. 
Problem-solving may furnish, also, an opportunity for 
increasing the child’s vocabulary, for teaching an intel- 
ligent use of the textbook, and for the collection of out- 
side data. 
. In the formation of correct habits of study the teacher 
should recognize the importance of (a) the formation of 
an outline for study, (b) appealing to the instincts of in- 
tellectual curiosity and physical activity to arouse in- 
terest, (c) making use of graphic portrayal of facts to 
appeal to visual imagery, and of (d) creating an atmos- 
phere in the schoolroom which is conducive to the men- 
tal and physical welfare of the pupils. 
PROBLEMS FOR INVESTIGATION AND 
DISCUSSION 
. “The object and reward of learning is continued capac- 
ity for growth.” (John Dewey.) 
Illustrate the truth of the above statement by ex- 
amples from literature and geography. 
“The school is the conscious means used by society to 
give children rich and varied experiences in wholesome 
living in the most economical way.” (F. G. Bonser.) 
What valuable experiences may a child receive in 
school that are usually impossible in the home? 
. Describe a recitation in history in which the subject- 
matter and method were selected with regard to the 
pupils’ comprehension and needs. 
. Suggest teacher’s and pupils’ aims, suitable for a fourth- 
grade lesson in arithmetic; a fifth-grade lesson in lan- 
guage; and a sixth-grade lesson in geography. 
. Suggest possible additions and omissions in a course of 
study which would be in accordance with the social aim 
of education.

CHAPTER II 
DETERMINATION OF TYPE OF RECITATION 
Lesson types explained. A recitation cannot 
usually be classed as distinctly of one type. The 
best teaching will shift from one type to another, 
as the needs demand. Too much attention to 
types can easily result in mechanical work, which 
is deadening to the thought of both pupils and 
teacher. There are, however, certain features 
which predominate in the teacher’s mind as she 
plans her work. This predominance is determined 
by the kind of learning involved. 
If the subject-matter is entirely new to the 
pupils and there is a difficult process to be mas- 
tered, or new facts to be comprehended, the 
teacher should determine her plans accordingly 
and the procedure will be a development lesson. 
If the facts are understood and the purpose is 
for the pupils to memorize them for a future need, 
or to become more skillful in their use, then the 
drill lesson is appropriate. 
Having understood the facts or processes in- 
volved, and having had drill to furnish practice in 
their use, the pupils will of necessity pass on to 
the acquisition of other facts and processes which 
are a part of the great cycle known as learning. 
Because of the nature of memory, it is necessary
-P-A-G-E-31
  TYPE OF RECITATION 17 
to have repeated practice to insure retention. It 
is also necessary to recall the facts, or to associate 
them in a new way with the fund of knowledge 
already established. This seeing of old facts in a 
new relation is the purpose of the review lesson. 
While the acquisition of new knowledge and 
practice in its use may be, and should be, enjoy- 
able to the pupil, there is a type of lesson which 
should be planned specifically for enjoyment. 
This type of school work, the appreciation lesson, 
should add to the joy of the child now, and should 
contribute to his future enjoyment of the best in 
art, literature, and music which has accumulated 
from the past, and which constitutes so rich a 
portion of his social inheritance. 
Illustration of types of teaching. A 2-A teacher 
planned a language lesson which illustrates the 
use of different types of teaching as the recitation 
proceeds. She selected the following aims: 
1. General aims: 
1. To create a desire for correct expression. 
2. To stimulate freedom and ease of expression. 
. 2. Specific aims: 
1. To teach the correct use of the past tense of 
certain verbs; come, tear, throw, break, give, 
get, take, ring, bring, write, buy, eat, wear, 
draw, sing, hang. 
2. To teach the use of the subordinate clause in- 
troduced by “who.” 
8. To eliminate the superfluous use of “and” ina 
series of words.
-P-A-G-E-32
  18 PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING APPLIED 
In order to realize the first aim — to create a 
desire for correct expression — the teacher em- 
ploys the conversational method, developing the 
facts that we have certain fashions in dress to 
which most people conform, and that there are 
“patterns” in language which it is well for us to 
recognize if we wish “‘to be in the fashion.” 
In the realization of the first specific aim — to 
teach the correct use of the past tense of certain 
verbs — the recitation is about equally divided 
between development and drill. Some pupils in 
the class will be familiar with the correct use of a 
few of the verbs; others will have mastered dif- 
ferent verbs; and there will be many to whom the 
correct form of each of the verbs is new. The 
only procedure which is adequate to meet the 
needs of such a group in this particular lesson is 
that which will provide a knowledge of the correct 
form and drill in its use. 
For economy in the learning process the teacher 
combines these aims with the realization of the 
second general aim — to stimulate freedom and 
ease of expression — and introduces a new game, 
“Do and Tell,” in which a pupil receives a com- 
mand; for example, “Break the stick. Give it to 
Mary.” The pupil obeys the command and tells 
the King, who has not seen the action, what he 
did. The teacher, acting as King’s Councilor, 
can umpire the game, thus insuring correct ex- 
pression, accurate score-keeping, etc.
-P-A-G-E-33
TYPE OF RECITATION 19 
Before the pupils tire of this part of the game, 
the teacher has planned to shift from drill to de- 
velopment, since it is the best possible time to in- 
troduce a new language fact. The procedure fol- 
lows: 
Teacher: “Who was it who broke the stick?” 
Pupil: “Mary.” 
Teacher: “‘When we were younger we were not ex- 
pected to answer with long sentences, but it is ‘the 
fashion’ for 2-A’s to make complete statements. It 
was Mary who broke the stick. Who was it who rang 
the bell?” 
Pupil: “It was George who rang the bell.” 
The learning cycle again demands drill, so this 
question-and-answer method continues until all 
have had an opportunity for practice. With these 
facts acquired, and with practice sufficient to fix 
the correct form in mind for the present, the 
teacher begins the realization of the third specific 
aim — to eliminate the superfluous “and.” 
Teacher: “Listen carefully. You may come to me, 
break the stick, and throw it in the basket, William.” 
(The pupil performs the required action.) ‘Tell the 
children what you did.” 
Pupil:.“I came to Miss M., and I broke the stick, 
and I threw it in the basket.” 
Teacher: “Sometimes we use unnecessary words. 
Can you tell William what words to leave out, so that 
his speaking may be in ‘the fashion’?” 
As the pupils seemed to have difficulty, the 
teacher asked how many of them would like to
-P-A-G-E-34
  20 PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING APPLIED 
have another game soon, so that they could learn 
the correct form for the new way of speaking, that 
the class might keep “in fashion.”” Every pupil 
was eager for activity along the same line; there- 
fore the teacher had at least made progress to- 
ward the realization of the third and last specific 
aim. 
The following results seemed apparent at the 
close of the recitation: 
1. An awakened interest in better speech habits; a 
desire to know and use the correct expression. 
2. Greater facility in the use of the practiced forms: 
a. Past tense of verbs. 
b. Clause introduced by “who.” 
3. A keen motive aroused toward further activity 
along the same line. 
4. A better social atmosphere in the class procedure: 
a. Through an enjoyment of wholesome humor. 
b. Through the play element in the game. 
ec. Through the sharing of responsibility in the 
race for points. 
The time here used was thirty minutes. As 
this is longer than can usually be allotted to lan- 
guage work in this grade at one time, this lesson 
could easily be divided into three parts; each 
technical fact being emphasized at one time. 
At the close of the recitation the teacher told 
the delightful story, “The Little Rabbit Who 
Wanted Red Wings.’’ This was wholly for en- 
joyment, and was one kind of appreciation lesson. 
In a later recitation the language facts which had 
 
-P-A-G-E-35
  
TYPE OF RECITATION 21 
been acquired, and used in practice, received new 
meaning and emphasis by a review under different 
conditions with new relations; a new game was 
played requiring the same oral usage. Further 
review was furnished when simple elliptical sen- 
tences were placed on the blackboard, with blanks 
to be filled with verbs selected by the pupils. 
Various methods explained. As the type of 
recitation must of necessity be flexible to meet the 
needs of the unitary nature of the learning proc- 
ess, so the teacher’s method will need to shift 
from one phase to another as occasion demands. 
No definite rule can be established as to the ex- 
act time to use the conversational method, the 
quiz, the lecture method, or the “socialized reci- 
tation.” 
In this choice, as in all procedure, the teacher 
must be guided by the aims, the kind of learning 
involved, the age of the pupils, the particular sub- 
ject-matter, and numerous other conditions inci- 
dent to the particular situation. 
The conversational lesson is the most satisfac- 
tory method of procedure when developing a new 
type of work. It should be informal, but none the 
less dignified. It gives the teacher an opportunity 
to ascertain the needs of the pupils, and also to 
check any incorrect impressions which may have 
been acquired. To give the pupil a chance to ex- 
press his opinions, or to ask questions, is to open
-P-A-G-E-36
  22 PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING APPLIED 
the way for new developments, and consequently 
leads to growth in ideas. 
In the conversational lesson the teacher should 
be the leader, guiding the trend of thought, and 
skillfully avoiding digressions which interrupt 
progress toward a determined goal. In any grade 
the conversational lesson should be the means of 
establishing a closer sympathy between teacher 
and pupils. It should give the timid pupil a 
chance to participate in the development of the sub- 
ject, thus providing a necessary self-confidence. 
The socialized recitation. The socialized reci- 
tation, or codperative type of recitation, is but a 
larger growth of the conversational method. In 
the broad use of this term all recitations should be 
socialized, but there is a growing tendency to ap- 
ply this name to that particular type of recitation 
or class activity when teacher and pupils work to- 
gether for the accomplishment of a conscious aim, 
and in such a manner that pupils have an increas- 
ing degree of responsibility and initiative. Here 
the pupils are encouraged to feel responsible for 
the development of the lesson. They talk freely 
among themselves and to the teacher about the 
subject under discussion. Since this method is 
prevalent in social circles, and in the handling of 
important affairs throughout life, it is of the 
greatest importance that pupils should early learn 
to conduct their own affairs in this manner.
-P-A-G-E-37
  TYPE OF RECITATION 23 
The socialized recitation is an open forum 
where pupils should feel the utmost freedom in 
participation. Freedom should never be con- 
strued as license, when the group is imposed upon 
by the idle remarks of unprepared and unthinking 
individuals. One needs only to recall many adult 
meetings to have a clear illustration of the inabil- 
ity of the average group to maintain a discussion, 
to which each contributes, without monopolizing 
the time or digressing from the point, thereby los- 
ing the main issue under discussion. 
Many teachers fail in this type of recitation be- 
cause of a mistaken notion that freedom on the 
part of the children demands non-interference on 
the part of the teacher. While it is highly de- 
sirable for a pupil to have charge of the recitation, 
this should not be expected until the pupils have 
consciously set up standards for this type of pro- 
cedure, and have agreed upon certain essentials of 
responsibility and leadership which will stimulate 
each pupil to contribute his best. Pupils should 
be encouraged to address the class when speaking, 
and also to address a particular individual when 
necessary to make inquiry or to offer criticism. 
At no time should a pupil depart from the cour- 
tesy due in any social group. This element should 
be thoroughly understood when standards are be- 
ing established. 
The teacher should not feel discouraged, when
-P-A-G-E-38
% PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING APPLIED 
  beginning this type of work, if the pupils are at 
first somewhat timid and at a loss for ideas. This 
is but natural in a system of schools where the 
teacher has dominated the situation to such an 
extent that the pupils have had no opportunity to 
develop initiative. 
Outstanding difficulties. There are three out- 
standing difficulties which the teacher may expect; 
a tendency to misuse this new power of criticism 
by seeing only the adverse side of a classmate’s 
effort, and consequently offering a criticism that 
hurts without helping; the opposite procedure, 
which considers that politeness demands a com- 
plimentary criticism in spite of poor effort; and 
the tendency to offer a stereotyped criticism, 
when the pupil is monotonously told that he 
“yead well,” or that his paper “was good,” or 
that he “mispronounced a word.” This per- 
functory routine is one of the most pernicious 
faults and should be constantly guarded against. 
Pupils may be inclined to become interested in 
the form of the recitation to the exclusion of the 
real aim, which includes spontaneity and codpera- 
tion. Other faults which may occur and need at- 
tention are the wrong influences of the officious 
and domineering pupil, and of the lazy or indif- 
ferent pupil who shirks responsibility. On the 
other hand, excessive social pressure will often 
lead to the intimidation of the slow pupil, or to an 
 
-P-A-G-E-39
  TYPE OF RECITATION 25 
exaggerated view of the group spirit, which tends 
toward the “gang” attitude and is distinctly anti- 
social. 
Any of these faults might develop in a recita- 
tion of the traditional type, and should not preju- 
dice the teacher against a method which obviously 
offers an opportunity for the development of posi- 
tive qualities in character. All of these faults may 
be overcome by a frequent reference to the estab- 
lished standards. The teacher should remember 
that growth in any habit depends upon constant 
usage under favorable conditions. Continued 
opportunity to develop initiative and judgment 
will result in higher attainment, which becomes 
increasingly discriminating with practice. 
The teacher should realize that she is, at times, 
a spectator whose business it is to see the class 
activities as a whole; a guide in planning the work, 
and in its successful execution; a counselor in all 
phases, whether it is subject-matter that is in- 
volved, or a discrimination in social matters of 
conduct; a judge of results and a critic of all lines 
of procedure; and, at the same time, the socializ- 
ing force which unifies and encourages the entire 
class. 
Standards for the socialized recitation. The 
following standards were developed by a fifth- 
grade class after the pupils had become interested 
in the socialized recitation, and wished to make it

a satisfactory method of procedure in their own 
classroom. ‘The standards here given were the 
result of their review of their attempts and fail- 
ures, and were aimed directly at immediate im- 
provement.

The lecture. It is customary to think of the 
lecture method as belonging particularly to the 
} university, but there are times when even the 
eS ( first-grade teacher uses this method, in simplified 
form. ‘There are certain stages in the develop- 
ment of any subject, in any grade, when it is ap-

propriate and desirable for the teacher to offer 
valuable information or carefully planned illus- 
trations which are not to be found in books, or 
which are more stimulating when interpreted and 
vivified by the teacher’s experience and person- 
ality. The acquisition of skill in this particular 
field would change the experience of many teach- 
ers from failure to success. The neglect to store a 
surplus fund of facts, and bring to the classroom 
recitation a larger and richer viewpoint than the 
pupils would otherwise obtain, is the cause ii 
much ineffective teaching. / 
On the other hand;-the teacher who ak 
wholly upon the lect methéd deprives her 
pupils of the chance for active expression, and 
thereby eliminates a favorable opportunity for 
growth. The teacher who/tallg at such length 
that pupils become listless and inattentive would 
do well to curb the use gf this methdd, while the 
teacher who is not dailf enlivening the\class dis-

source of joy to the ambitious teacher. 
“#2 Tilustrations of the lecture method. A sixth- | 
“grade teacher, who taught in a city of the Middle 
  West, used the lecture method when she told of 
her summer vacation through California and the 
Grand Canyon of Arizona. She organized the
-P-A-G-E-42
  28 PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING APPLIED 
material so that it would illustrate various topics 
and problems which the pupils had been study- 
ing, and so that the pupils would get a sequence 
of events in time and place. Postcard views in 
a projectorscope added interest to this lecture 
method. 
A fourth-grade teacher, who had not traveled 
in Europe, collected as many books as she could 
find which illustrated or told in simple language of 
the life of the people of Holland. When the reci- 
tation centered on this subject, she knew just the 
illustrations to use in order to make the textbook 
material more interesting. She was also ready to 
cite particular pages in the books for the further 
investigation of different pupils on topics of spe- 
cial interest. Here was the lecture method sim- 
plified, but adequately meeting the need of these 
pupils by adding to their knowledge, by enlarging 
their views, and by stimulating them to research 
work suited to their age and ability. 
A first-grade teacher, after a conversational les- 
son in which she developed a knowledge of the 
means of communication used in the present day 
—personal conversation, letter writing, tele- 
phone, telegraph“* told the pupils of the ways in 
which the Indian communicated with his neigh- 
bors — by signal fires, by picture writing, aaa

pupil in a variety of subjects about which he has 
heretofore not felt a need of knowing. Such a 
need demands the simplified lecture method. The 
teacher must not only know; dhe must also know 
how to tell. An artistic ability in portraying a 
vast array of information is a quality which it 
pays all teachers to cultivate. 7/,, ye 
EDUCATIONAL PRINCIPLES INVOLVED IN 
THE FOREGOING DISCUSSION 
1. Since the unified nature of the mental processes calls 
for a frequent shift from one kind of learning to another, 
the recitation should never become mechanized into a 
mere type form; the teaching should be suited to the 
kind of learning involved. 
2. A frequent analysis of procedure is necessary to insure 
a correct balance in the choice of subject-matter and 
method; this choice should depend upon age of pupils, 
aims, and other conditions which are incident to the 
particular situation. 
8. The nature of the learning process demands propor- 
tionate emphasis upon development, drill, review, and 
appreciation; any recitation may be adapted to first 
one and then another procedure to suit the immediate 
need. 
4. Interest and social unity may be developed by means of 
a friendly contest in group achievement which appeals 
to the pupil’s instinct for rivalry and promotes good will 
in the class. 
5. The conversational lesson is particularly adapted to the 
development of new work, as it affords opportunity for 
the teacher to ascertain and eliminate immediate causes 
of difficulty. 
6. The socialized recitation, or group activity, provides a 
situation similar to that which the child meets in real 
life, and should be encouraged. It cultivates freedom of 
expression, controlled by courtesy and good judgment. |
-P-A-G-E-44
  80 — 
Il. PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING APPLIED 
. Spontaneity and codperation are highly desirable at- 
tributes of character which should receive stimulus by 
means of the socialized recitation. Mere perfunctori- 
ness in the use of formal phrases and methods should 
not be mistaken for the real aim of the socialized recita- 
tion. 
. The organization of definite standards for work by the 
pupils themselves is a help in realizing the best results, 
. The teacher should feel responsible for a knowledge of 
and a participation in all the activities of the class, that 
she may influence without dominating. 
. The lecture method is essential to all successful teach- 
ing, but should be simplified and adapted to meet the 
needs of a particular group. The ability to contribute 
appropriate, desirable, and interesting information is an 
asset to any teacher. 
The teacher should be able to discriminate in the use 
of any method, that she may not monopolize the time 
and thus deprive the pupils of growth through active 
expression. 
PROBLEMS FOR INVESTIGATION AND 
DISCUSSION 
. How may a teacher determine the type of recitation 
which is appropriate at a given time? 
. Suggest advantages and dangers in the use of the con- 
versational method. 
. Describe a socialized recitation in which courtesy and 
good judgment on the part of pupils were emphasized. 
. How may a teacher improve her ability to contribute 
appropriate, valuable, and interesting information to 
the class recitation? 
. Why should spontaneity of expression and codperation 
be emphasized in school work? What difficulties may 
a teacher encounter in attempting improvement along 
these lines?

CHAPTER III 
ORGANIZATION OF WORK 
Definite plan of procedure. The topic of organ- 
ization is of such fundamental importance in the 
success of school work that the teacher will do 
well to view it from all angles. She must not only 
have definite aims and specific purposes; she must 
also have a definite plan of procedure. 
The effective lesson plan is to the teacher what 
the blue-print is to the architect. When the archi- 
tect is planning a specific structure he knows the 
exact location and studies the particular sur- 
roundings. He knows the needs that this par- 
ticular building is to serve, and determines his 
plans to meet those needs; he not only wishes to 
build a structure that will serve, he wishes to se- 
cure beauty with utility. He knows just the ma- 
terial that will be needed to secure the desired 
effect, and the kind of workmanship which is nec- 
essary to the completion of his plans. He visual- 
izes the finished structure and plans every detail 
to meet a specific need. 
Fruitful lesson planning should be a dramatic 
rehearsal on the part of the teacher of what she 
expects to happen in the class. She must hold in 
consciousness three factors: the children, the sub-
-P-A-G-E-47
  
  ORGANIZATION 383 
ject-matter or materials, and the method. : The 
teacher must know the pupils, their natural tend- 
encies, their past experiences, their present felt 
needs, or needs which they may now be stimu- 
lated to feel. She should know the laws of learn- 
ing which govern the desired changes which she 
wishes to make in these children, whether habits, 
knowledges, attitudes, appreciations, or purposes. 
She should know the subject-matter or materials 
which will be the most appropriate stimuli for 
producing changes. If she can stimulate and 
foster an inquiring attitude, the method chosen is 
probably reliable. Skill in preparing the situa- 
tion to call forth the desired responses is skill in 
method. The teacher should frequently ask: 
“How will the children react to this?” ‘What 
will be the response to that?” ‘‘ What shall I 
say or do then?” 
A constant reference to this particular individ- 
ual or to that peculiar personality will enable the 
teacher to provide for individual differences. She 
should never lose sight of the fact that what will 
appeal to one may not be an adequate stimulus to 
another. 
Every lesson plan should provide some means 
of checking results for teacher and pupil, to see to 
what extent the purposes of each have been ful- 
filled. The means of testing may range from a 
feeling of satisfaction on the part of the child,  
-P-A-G-E-48
  34 PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING APPLIED 
which leads him to want to repeat the activity, to 
the use of a standard test. The nature of the 
work determines the nature of the check. 
Satisfactory lesson planning should provide for 
future activity through a carefully considered 
assignment, and should provide for growth in 
power to do independent work through the for- 
mation of correct habits of study. 
While the lesson plan should receive much time, 
and should be very definite, even to details, the 
teacher should not feel that it must be invariably 
followed when circumstances arise which will ad- 
mit of favorable substitution. Experience will 
often prove that the best-laid plan will sometimes 
need to be postponed to admit the discussion or 
explanation of a more immediate problem. The 
teacher should be sufficiently flexible to recognize 
an immediate need and to digress from the for- 
mulated plans, if good judgment suggests such 
procedure. In any situation the dramatic re- 
hearsal previously suggested will have prepared 
the teacher for many of the departures which may 
occur, and she can prevent wasteful digression by 
having given forethought to this possibility. 
Selection and arrangement of subject-matter. 
The teacher usually has the responsibility of 
selecting the subject-matter from the course of 
study. Having become familiar with the re- 
quired amount of work to be given in a term, she 
 
-P-A-G-E-49
  ORGANIZATION 35 
should plan a definite sequence which will be the 
most appropriate for the particular class. If the 
course of study is meager in suggestions, the 
teacher should study to supplement the required 
subject-matter with material that will be inter- 
esting; if much optional material is provided, 
the teacher should feel responsible for making a 
wise selection to meet specific needs. 
The teacher who plans and assigns work merely 
by the pages of the textbook is doing little more 
than could be provided by any automatic device. 
Such mechanical routine can but result in stunted 
personality on the part of the teacher and in 
dwarfed growth of the children. The progressive 
teacher will use the available textbook as a key to 
the situation, but will plan to stimulate pupils to a 
search for abundant subject-matter outside the 
given text, and will, by example and suggestion, 
contribute valuable information which will direct 
research work suited to the age and interests of 
the pupils. 
Evaluation during class recitation. Many of 
the failures in life’s activities are due to an inabil- 
, ity to recognize relative values. The cook who 
’ fails to season the food in the right proportions; 
the farmer who ploughs and harrows industri- 
ously, but fails to select his seed with care; the 
father who grants every desire of an extravagant 
child; the milliner who lays in a stock of gaudy  
-P-A-G-E-50

36 PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING APPLIED 
and unsubstantial materials; the student who de- 
votes every hour to brain work with no plan for 
recreation; the artist who paints the landscape 
without a study of tree growth; these and count- 
less other examples are evident, in all of life’s re- 
lations, where success is not attained because of 
failure to evaluate the elements of the necessary 
affairs of each day. 
The teacher has a double responsibility in her 
particular field. She must learn to evaluate the 
materials and events of each recitation; she should 
also lead her pupils to acquire this necessary habit 
of evaluation. So long as the teacher shows no 
discrimination in the emphasis placed upon the 
various facts of the subject-matter, she need not 
expect more from the pupils. She should strive to 
impress upon the pupils the important truth that 
facts vary in importance, and that certain facts 
important at one time may have little bearing 
upon the point at issue at another time. It is 
small wonder that the learner, who approaches 
the field of knowledge expecting all facts to be of 
equal value, is discouraged by the vast aggrega- 
tion of separate bits of information which must be 
amassed before he has any chance for progress. 
What a different undertaking when he has learned 
to note certain items of strategic importance, and 
to group the related facts accordingly! 
The college freshman who naively told the pro-  
-P-A-G-E-51
  ORGANIZATION 37 
fessor that he couldn’t remember the answer, but 
he believed that it was at the bottom of the page, 
was not so far inferior to the average student who 
studies by pages instead of by thought units. 
Pupils should early be taught to select the im- 
portant points, and then to surround these points 
with the supporting items, just as the general 
seeks to attain the strategic places and later adds 
the surrounding territory to his conquests. They 
should be encouraged to weigh their own answers 
and those of their classmates, to see what each 
has contributed to the discussion, and in what 
way there was error, if any. They should early 
learn to check up on the solution of any problem, 
to see what progress has been attained, and what 
should be the next step in procedure. 
Pupils should be stimulated to select materials 
and to arrange them in the best order for presenta- 
tion to the class. This selection and presentation 
involve not only the ability to evaluate, but also 
initiative, which is a very necessary requisite of 
successful organization. Much of the inatten- 
tion in the classroom would disappear if pupils 
were given an opportunity to use their judgment 
and initiative in conducting class affairs. Mis- 
takes will be made, and much time will be con- 
sumed in learning to use these neglected abilities; 
but the evaluation of the time element is one of 
the most important factors in all organization;
-P-A-G-E-52
  88 PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING APPLIED 
therefore it should be given consideration in 
school procedure. 
Ability to clinch ideas through summary. Asa 
final step in organization the teacher should pro- 
vide for a definite résumé of the important facts 
of the lesson. It is not desirable to chop off each 
recitation in such a manner that it seems unre- 
lated to every other lesson; and yet it is profitable 
to leave in the mind of the pupil a completed, uni- 
fied whole. To the extent that the pupil feels at 
the close of the recitation that definite progress 
has been made, definite facts have been accumu- 
lated, definite principles have been grasped, he 
will acquire that feeling of mastery which leads to 
self-confidence and future growth. 
The teacher cannot afford to neglect the pointed 
summary of each lesson, and of each unit of sub- 
ject-matter. It is time well spent, showing justi- 
fiable returns in pupil progress. No set formula 
need be followed in conducting the summary. At 
one time the teacher may summarize; at another 
time a pupil may state the leading points. At 
times all pupils may be asked to list the important 
points in a given unit of study. Variety lends 
interest to this element of the recitation as well as 
to all procedure; the nature of the subject may 
determine the character of the summary.

velop the facts necessary by means of oral prepa- 
ration; and to use a real life-interest as a motive 
for the pupil activity. 
I. Teacher’s aims: 
_ 1. General: 
1. To stimulate thought. 
2. To arouse a civic interest in the welfare 
of others. 
8. To develop a systematic method of out- 
lining a topic under discussion. 
2. Specific: 
1. To arouse an immediate interest in 
Safety for School Children. 
2. To encourage pupils to express their 
thoughts freely. 
8. To develop the ability to evaluate con- 
tributions. 
4. To guide in the development of a defi- 
nite outline of standards to be used in 
written composition. 
II. The pupils’ purposes: 
1. To discuss the “Safety” situation in 
their city to see what might be done to 
help. 
2. To plan specific means toward improve- 
ment. 
To arouse an immediate interest the teacher 
read a newspaper clipping describing the “Safety” 
situation in Detroit, with an account of previous 
needs and remedial measures employed with fa- 
vorable results. 
Teacher: “Does this account suggest to you any 
topic which we may profitably discuss this afternoon?”
-P-A-G-E-54
40 PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING APPLIED 
Pupil: “Since we are interested especially in our 
own city, we might discuss the accidents here.” 
Teacher: “What is to be our purpose in this discus- 
sion?” 
Pupil: “To see if there are many accidents. ... To 
see if Safety is important.” 
Pupils were asked to think of accidents which 
they knew had happened to home children. To 
prevent gruesome details the teacher continued 
as follows: 
“Tt is not a pleasant subject to discuss, but some- 
times it is necessary to think seriously about really un- 
pleasant subjects in order to help the situation. For 
our purpose to-day, which do you think will be more 
profitable, to discuss each accident in detail, or merely 
to name the accidents?” 
Pupils decided that to name the accidents 
would be better because it would take too much 
time to discuss them, and would not add any 
profitable element to the main purpose. They 
then named various accidents which had occurred, 
while the teacher listed them on the blackboard. 
Teacher: “Now that we know of such an alarming 
number of accidents, what do you think it would be 
profitable to discuss next?” 
Pupil: “How can such accidents be prevented?” 
Pupils then contributed various suggestions 
which were classed under the following topics: 
1. Safe places to play. 
2. Safe things to play. 
8. Prevention of fires. 
4. How to avoid falls.
-P-A-G-E-55
  
ORGANIZATION — 41 
Teacher: “We now have thought about the number 
of accidents and the kinds of accidents. What large 
topic will include these two items?” 
Pupil: ‘‘Important Accidents’ should be the large 
topic.” 
Another pupil: “I think the large topic should be 
‘Importance of Safety,’ because it is the Safety that 
we want to emphasize.” 
After a continued discussion, in which the re- 
sponsibility for decisions was continually thrown 
upon the pupils, the class arranged the following 
outline: 
I. Importance of safety. 
A. Value of health and sound bodies. 
B. Number of accidents. 
C. Kinds of accidents. 
. Train. 
. Traffic. 
. Sealding. 
. Firearms, and fireworks. 
. Play — Playground equipment. 
. Roller skates. 
. Falls. 
. Drowning. 
II. How to prevent accidents. 
A. Safe places to play. 
B. Safe things to play and safe toys. 
C. Safe places to walk. 
D. Safe companions. 
E. Prevention of fires. 
F. How to avoid falls. 
TI. What can the 6-B’s of Lincoln Building do? 
A. In our homes. 
B. At the street crossings. _ 
C. At the railroad crossings. 
D. By example.

After this organized summary of the discussion 
the teacher gave opportunity for further activity 
by opening new lines of thought: 
Teacher: “Do you wish to confine your help to our 
own school, or would you like to help the pupils in 
other schools?” 
Pupil: “I wish we might help other children so that 
all might be helped.” 
Another pupil: “ We could tell other pupils when we 
saw them.” 
Other pupils: “We could write a composition and 
send it to other buildings. . . . It would be much better 
to send some one to each building to read his own 
composition.” 
- The pupils then decided that the outline on the 
board would be an excellent help in writing a good 
composition. When asked what else would be 
necessary to assure the best composition, they 
developed the following standards, which the 
teacher wrote on the blackboard: 
Standards for written composition. 
1. Thought is the most important element. 
2. Stay with the subject. 
. Interest is important. 
. Punctuation; capitalization. 
. Penmanship. 
. Good English — correct grammar. 
. Spelling. 
. A good beginning. 
. A strong ending. 
. Attractive title. SOD MAIDA SOO _

The new responsibility furnished a strong mo-

that the pupils writing the best papers should be 
chosen to represent the class in each of the ten 
buildings in the city. 
EDUCATIONAL PRINCIPLES INVOLVED .IN 
THE FOREGOING DISCUSSION 
1. A definite plan of procedure is essential to economy of 
effort in teaching; it should take account of three 
factors; the children, the subject-matter, and the 
method. 
. The lesson plan should provide for individual differ- 
ences, for the formation of correct habits of study, and 
for future activity through the assignment. 
. Flexibility in the interpretation of the situation, and 
in appropriate substitution when necessary, should be 
cultivated by the teacher. Definite planning to check 
the results of teaching will enable her to estimate prog- 
ress. 
. Pupils should be stimulated to do research work suited 
to their needs and abilities; they should be taught that 
facts vary in value, and should, therefore, receive pro- 
portionate emphasis. 
. The ability to recognize relative values, and govern one’s 
conduct accordingly, is an attribute of success in life; 
therefore school work should stimulate and develop 
this ability. 
. Initiative may be developed by the selection, evalua- 
tion, and arrangement of facts for presentation to the 
class; while the formation of an outline for study fur- 
nishes practice in organization, and contributes to the 
organization of further ideas. 
. A definite purpose related to a real life situation is the 
best motive for effective organization; and a pointed 
summary clinches the main elements in a discussion, 
and should be a regular part of the recitation.

CHAPTER IV 
BUILDING SITUATIONS TO AROUSE 
APPROPRIATE MOTIVES 
Relating School work to life. Securing purpose- 
ful activity on the part of pupils is an essential of 
successful teaching. Seat work, that is merely 
an occupation while the teacher is hearing another 
class recite, is no longer recognized as justifiable 
procedure. The teacher must be able to distin- 
guish between the quiet which comes from the 
passive acceptance of teacher authority, and that 
quiet which is the result of absorbing interest in 
an engrossing activity. Nor should the teacher 
“ rely merely upon the effect of her own personality 
or the pupil's courtesy to hold his attention dur- 
ing the recitation period. 
A desirable type of interest can be secured only 
when school work is related to the life of the child. 
Overemphasis upon school work as a preparation 
for future living has led to a neglect of the chil- 
dren’s interests at the present time. Contrary to 
one-time opinion, work that is distasteful and dif- 
ficult is no more beneficial than that which is 
agreeable and can be accomplished with a reason- 
able degree of effort. 
The play instinct and the instinct for physical

activity are two allies which progressive teachers 
have used to reorganize educational practice. 
Playing store with real articles to buy and sell, 
games, dramatization, writing a letter to ask for 
a needed supply, or to request a privilege for the 
class, modeling an Indian Village, writing a diary 
of a boy of the Colonial Period, making a garden, 
giving a puppet show, making a motion-picture 
reel, making a cook-book, giving a play or pag- 
eant, building and furnishing a doll-house — 
these are real, purposeful activities for the nor- 
mal child, and furnish abundant opportunities for 
learning the arithmetical, geographical, histor- 
ical, scientific, or language facts which are needed 
in his life, as well as for developing creative and 
artistic ability in a natural manner. 
A natural motive provides a drawing force 
which leads the child on into further activity, with 
interest as a stimulus. It is the teacher’s chief 
business to build the situation so as to arouse ap- 
propriate motives. There is danger that she will 
be overinfluenced by the desire to crowd upon the 
child those facts which she wishes him to learn, 
because tradition has established them as requi- 
sites of the curricula. Fortunately for the child, 
modern courses of study are eliminating much 
that was formerly required in the elementary 
school. Where the choice rests with the teacher, 
she should confine her efforts to those activities in
-P-A-G-E-61
  BUILDING SITUATIONS 47 
which she is able to create a real interest, fully 
appreciating the possibilities and responsibilities 
of introducing new interest and of creating new 
and worthy desires by opening up avenues of in- 
formation and experiences hitherto unexplored. 
In order to realize this new aim the teacher 
must be familiar with child interests, and must 
be alert to see relations appropriate for school use. 
She should manifest great care that interests are 
not assumed through a desire to please the 
teacher. There are abundant activities in which 
a child is vitally interested without having un- 
natural interests superimposed by the teacher. 
Illustrations of school activities related to life. 
While studying the geo; m 
States, a fourth-grade class became interested_in 
cotton. They visited a knitting factory to see the 
raw cotton made into underwear. They calcu- 
lated amounts and costs of raw materials, thread, 
buttons, finished garments, boxes, etc. They 
traced transportation routes of raw materials to 
the factory, and of finished products to various 
places of shipment. (They learned to take notes 
and organize them for class discussion. Some of 
them became interested in the pasteboard and 
wooden boxes used for shipping, and, with this as 
a motive, investigated the paper and lumbering 
industries to find out what processes were neces- 
sary before the local factory could receive the 
 
-P-A-G-E-62
    48 .PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING APPLIED 
boxes. Others became interested in the various 
kinds of motor power used in the factory. While 
the main interest was in seeing how an article of 
clothing was made, the interest widened to in- 
clude important facts in geography, arithmetic, 
science, industrial arts, reading, spelling, pen- 
manship, and English composition, both oral and 
written. Even history and civics came in for a 
share in the discussion, when slavery was intro- 
duced asa topic. Southern folk-songs and stories 
took on new meaning, and a permanent and far- 
reaching interest was aroused in other processes 
and activities related to life’s needs. 
To the conservative mind, bound by tradition, 
this may seem an extravagant claim to make for 
. one little excursion trip, but those who have tried 
it know that the possibilities are here merely sug- 
gested. . 
Providing incentives. Various incentives may 
serve as temporary stimuli, but should never be 
confused with that deep, underlyi ive which 
comes from a life interest that is allowed to de- 
velop and is encouraged to fruition. —

of others is an instinct which can be utilized by 
the display of best work. In displaying the work 
of pupils the teacher should devise a scheme which 
will enable the weakest pupil to be represented. 
{To show only the work of the superior pupil is to

best_effort. On the other hand, care should be 
used that inferior work does not remain in sight 
to the extent that ideals become confused. If the 
work of certain pupils always deserves recogni- 
tion, the name of the pupil may be placed on a 
special honor roll so long as the high standard is 
maintained, to be removed whenever the pupil 
fails to achieve a commendable attainment. 
The pupils of a sixth grade had been studying 
house furnishings. They had emphasized rela- 
tive values of various combinations from the 
standpoint of original costs, artistic arrangement 
and effect, and economy through utility. They 
planned the decorating and furnishing of each 
room, collected pictures to illustrate, and esti- 
mated the costs. It was understood that at the 
close of the study each child was to exhibit a 
booklet representing his best effort. 
Only the best booklets were placed in conspicu- 
ous positions, but all were placed on display.

served recognition for what he had done; if good, 
he felt justified; if poor, he was able to make com- 
parisons, and consequently could improve. The 
purpose of the display would, of course, deter- 
mine whether or not this teacher was right. In 
the daily display of work the selection need not be 
so discriminating as in the public exhibit, where 
standards are being compared, and where only 
the best work should be shown. 
The teacher who is satisfied with inferior results 
is not to be commended any more than the teacher 
who “touches up” the work of each pupil to make 
a creditable showing in the exhibit. It is usually 
a very enlightening experience to the parent to be 
able to see the work of his child compared with 
the work of other pupils in the same grade. In 
this way he is able to see reasons for the grades 
which the child has received, and often sees ways 
in which a closer codperation will be to the advan- 
tage of his child. 
Whether it is the daily display of work for the 
purpose of allowing the pupils to develop power 
in evaluating results, or the public exhibit for the 
purpose of more extensive comparisons, whcle- 
some pride in work well done is an incentive which 
is full of suggestions for the thoughtful teacher. 
Graphs of achievement. Graphs or pictures of 
achievement may be made and interpreted by 
pupils as early as Grade 4. The horizontal or ver-
-P-A-G-E-65
  BUILDING SITUATIONS 61 
tical bar is the easiest graph to be interpreted. 
The horizontal line, rising or falling as the daily 
record demands, is an easy way to show compara- 
tive progress. While comparison with classmates 
or with grade norms is often stimulating, a pupil 
should always be encouraged to compete with his 
own best record. 
Class graphs made to show daily or weekly av- 
erages of the class may be kept on the board until 
the pupils learn the principles of graph-making, 
when individual records are desirable. Friendly 
rivalry between classes may be encouraged by 
means of this graphic portrayal of achievement. 
A sixth-grade class received needed practice in 
computation by showing the weekly progress, by 
class averages, and their own scores expressed as 
per cents. 
A fifth-grade class kept individual records of 
daily progress in spelling. To watch the graph 
line grow upward furnished keen interest and con- 
sequent improvement. 
Appropriate rewards. Rewards should be 
selected with the effect upon the child’s character 
in mind. To encourage best effort without de- 
veloping selfishness, snobbishness, or dishonesty 
is the problem of the efficient teacher. Special 
privileges, which recognize ability and promote 
service to the group, are usually fitting rewards. 
For the younger pupil a gold star after his  
-P-A-G-E-66
  52 PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING APPLIED 
name, or a grade made with colored chalk on his 
paper, is a sufficient incentive to inspire best ef- 
fort. A first-grade teacher provided an attractive 
doll, which was waiting in its carriage for the 
pupil who had such bright eyes and speedy fingers 
that the letter cards were arranged into required 
words. As age increases, this childish delight in 
simple rewards passes, and the teacher must seek 
for something more interesting to attract his at- 
tention and to challenge his endeavor. 
To be selected as teacher’s assistant is a reward 
which holds much attraction and offers many op- 
portunities for expression; but it has many dangers 
of which the inexperienced teacher should beware. 
Nothing is more detrimental to the spirit of a 
school than for the pupils to feel that privileges 
are not equitably distributed. If the pupils havea 
part in naming the privilege and in appointing the 
assistant, it not only gives them an opportunity to 
evaluate, but also increases the spirit of codpera- 
tion which is essential to the best school spirit. 
The awarding of prizes for work which extends 
over long periods of time, or for special occasions, 
should not be encouraged, as it places emphasis 
upon wrong values. Even with carefully selected 
rewards the dangers are numerous. The teacher 
who depends upon life interests as a background 
for school work is following a safe guide, which will 
eventually win the pupils’ best effort. 
 
-P-A-G-E-67
BUILDING SITUATIONS 53 
The provision of extra materials. Recognizing 
and providing for individual differences will solve 
many problems for the teacher. The provision of 
abundant interesting materials for the alert pupil 
prevents the possible problems in discipline which 
arise from the unoccupied child. ‘‘An ounce of 
prevention is worth a pound of cure” in this situ- 
ation. 
Supplying extra work for superior pupils is one 
way of obviating the inequality which exists in the 
classification of even the best-organized schools. 
Since the average class of to-day is composed of 
from thirty to forty pupils, the teacher cannot 
expect them to be of equal ability. There should 
always be extra requirements or supplementary 
work which will profitably employ the child of 
larger capacities. This work should be interest- 
ing, and should appeal to his originality and inde- 
pendence by permitting some choice. 
A fifth-grade class was writing a play, “Life 
Along the Amazon.” The assignment’was to se- 
cure information about Brazil furnished in the 
textbook. For the pupils who finished first, the 
teacher had provided extra geography texts, sup- 
plementary readers, and stereographs, giving in- 
teresting information on the selected theme. On 
a special table were materials for cutting and 
mounting pictures, and samples to illustrate the 
rubber industry.
-P-A-G-E-68
  54 PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING APPLIED 
A second-grade teacher equipped a bright cor- 
ner of the classroom with a rug, a low table, small 
chairs, and several supplementary readers and 
stories. When work was well done or quickly 
finished, it was considered a special privilege to 
read in “the library.” 
A first-grade teacher encouraged speed and ac- 
curacy by permitting the use of the sand-table 
and modeling materials to those pupils who com- 
pleted assigned work. As there was always a 
group project in progress, the pupils were never at 
a loss for ideas as to what would be profitable to 
make. At one time it was the cows which Boy 
Blue allowed to get in the corn; at another time it 
was the bowls for the porridge of the Three Bears. 
A little time spent in collecting materials, a few 
words of explanation when making the assign- 
ment, an occasional checking to see that pupils 
were acquiring the right habits of study, and this 
extra material produced opportunities for growth 
which no teacher could afford to neglect. 
EDUCATIONAL PRINCIPLES INVOLVED IN

1. School work which is related to the life of the child fur- 
nishes the best motive for purposeful activity; it is a 
teacher’s responsibility to build situations to arouse ap- 
propriate motives. 
2. Recognizing relations between the child’s interests and 
desired subject-matter is a requisite of successful teach- 
ing; utilizing the play instinct is a source of inspiration 
to the progressive teacher.

hae BUILDING SITUATIONS 55 
. There is no particular virtue in imposing tasks that are 
discouragingly difficult and uninteresting; nor is a quiet 
schoolroom always indicative of purposeful work. 
. Since the child’s mind is not accustomed to sustained 
purposes, it is often wise to supply temporary incen- 
tives. The carefully planned and supervised class ex- 
cursion provides an excellent stimulus to purposeful 
activity. 
. Occasional public exhibits of school work are beneficial 
to parents and community by stimulating interest and 
codperation. 
. Simple graphic portrayal of individual and class prog- 
ress appeals to the pupil’s interest through his manipu- 
lative instinct and his instinct for competition or rivalry. 
. Appropriate rewards will encourage best effort without 
developing undesirable characteristics. The teacher 
should be an example in establishing honest standards. 
. To be permitted to assist the teacher appeals to the 
child’s instinct of emulation, and may be a source of 
good to the entire class. 
. The giving of prizes emphasizes individual effort instead 
of group achievement, and is destructive to good school 
spirit. 
Individual differences in children demand variety in 
school procedure. 
The provision of adequate supplementary materials, 
and the assignment of extra work, will extend the serv- 
ice of the school by the development of initiative and 
the promotion of a more equitable adjustment of group 
organization.

  CHAPTER V 
ABILITY TO SECURE AND HOLD INTEREST 
Many teachers become discouraged over their 
inability to secure and hold the interest of their 
pupils, and lament the fact that they do not have 
the “magic touchstone” which every teacher 
should possess. No one will deny the charms of 
an attractive and forceful personality, but the 
discouraged teacher should look deeper for the 
cause of her failure, and seek out remedial meas- 
ures to correct the difficulty. 
Much of the so-called disorder in the school- 
room is due to the fact that pupils have been com- 
pelled to force their attention to tasks that held no 
interest. If the weary teacher could only remem- 
ber that few children grasp the significance of 
school work from the adult viewpoint, there would 
be more adjustment to meet the child’s need at 
the present time. 
The apperceptive basis as an approach to new 
ideas. To sense the capacity, the interests, and 
the previous experience of the pupils is the first 
step toward securing their interest. The child is 
capable of becoming absorbingly interested in im- 
mediate goals. If the goal is sufficiently desir- 
able, he will labor with an unbelievable amount of 
endurance to accomplish his purpose.

A seven-year-old boy worked eight hours to 
build a miniature town, with streets carefully laid 
out and a complete system of telephone poles and 
wires on every street. No thought of fatigue was 
manifested; only a feeling of satisfaction over the 
finished work, the attained goal. 
A twelve-year-old boy and his younger sister 
worked all day to complete a merry-go-round that 
would “go.” Lengths had to be measured, pro- 
portions must be calculated, materials must be 
evaluated, but no fatigue was evident, because the 
work appealed to a present felt need. 
There is no more enlightening occupation for 
the teacher than to study the spontaneity of at- 
tention, the ingenuity in finding ways and means, 
and the persistency of effort which accompany a 
task when the child’s interest is engaged. 
To put “old heads on young shoulders” is not 
the purpose of the school; rather to enable the 
child to exercise the powers with which he has 
been endowed and to find new avenues of expres- 
sion. As he advances in age, he should gain an in- 
creasing ability in positing more distant goals and 
in grasping the significance of deferred results. 
The only way to create new aims and to estab- 
lish new ideals is to appeal to that which is al- 
ready known, little by little enlarging the stock 
of knowledge, skills,- habits, attitudes, and pur- 
poses which make up the child’s abilities. By

building the new upon the old the teacher makes 
use of the psychological law of apperception, and 
is working with nature. 
We have already noted various instincts which 
are the child’s original endowment. He is in- 
stinctively interested in physical activity, manip- 
ulation or construction, competition or rivalry, 
emulation, imitation, collecting, and in gaining 
the approval of others. To recognize and cap- 
italize on these instincts is economy of educa- 
tional effort. To give the child things to do; to 
help him to find things to do with, to lead into 
larger fields of endeavor, and to assist in making 
work satisfying are principles which aid in secur- 
ing the kind of attention and interest which leads 
to purposeful activity. 
Capitalizing an interest. Albert was a bright- 
eyed boy of ten whose lack of interest was duly 
reported to the new teacher. Other pupils and 
former teachers were not slow to tell of his indif- 
ference. On the first day of school, upon investi- 
gating the cause of a disturbance in one corner of . 
the room, the teacher discovered Albert exhibiting 
atiny terrapin. The little creature was very gro- 
tesque in its endeavor to adapt itself to its unusual 
environment — the shining surface of a school 
desk — and the pupils were absorbed with interest. 
Coupled with this natural interest in the unusual 
was a curiosity as to what would happen to Albert.
-P-A-G-E-74
    60 PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING APPLIED 
With the wisdom of much experience and a 
sense of humor which seldom failed, the teacher 
walked quietly back to Albert’s desk as if terra- 
pins in the schoolroom were not at all unusual. 
There was no trace of patronage in her manner as 
she asked Albert where he had found it and how 
he had succeeded in bringing it to school. She 
frankly admired its beautiful coloring, and re- 
marked about the peculiar pattern on its back. 
All this time she was watching the changing ex- 
pression on the boy’s face. Tantalizing roguish- 
ness, incredulous approval, and finally uncon- 
scious surrender showed plainly in the sensitive 
face of this boy who had the reputation of being a 
ne’er-do-well. Finally the teacher suggested that 
perhaps it would be kinder to find a more com- 
fortable temporary home for the terrapin than in 
Albert’s pocket. A shelter was hastily impro- 
vised, and the incident was closed for the time by 
the teacher’s remark that any of Albert’s “finds” 
would be welcome in the schoolroom. 
This was the first of many nature subjects in- 
troduced by Albert. This open-minded teacher 
discerned the real interest hidden under an indif- 
ference to the usual school subjects. Through his 
unusual interest in nature, the teacher, by means 
of sympathetic appreciation and thoughtful plan- 
ning, led to an interest in reading for information 
concerning his subjects. By reporting to the class 
’ 
 
-P-A-G-E-75
  ABILITY TO SECURE INTEREST 61 
his observations during his excursions in search of 
specimens, he became interested in better English, 
and incidentally gained in favor with the class. 
His interest in collecting was not confined to the 
animal world. He soon became interested in the 
various rock formations found in great variety in 
that locality. Encouragement by the teacher 
led the entire class to assemble a very good col- 
lection. A scientist from a local college helped 
the school to classify the specimens so that the 
pupils could label them. 
It is obvious that such codperative effort soon 
eliminated the impression of indifference that 
Albert had made, while he grew daily more eager 
to hold his recently acquired feeling of respect 
through participation. 
This teacher was successful because she was not 
prejudiced by the boy’s previous record. She 
studied him carefully to find a common interest. 
Having found this interest, she treated him as a 
companion in investigation, which required mu- 
tual dependence and codperation. Partnership 
with a teacher is a fine thing for such a boy. To 
know just the degree of attention which will lead 
aright, without humoring his caprices, is the qual- 
ity which he most admires and to which his dor- 
mant energies make the readiest response. 
Making assignments. The assignment of work 
is of sufficient importance [ justify careful plan- 
 
-P-A-G-E-76

x 
ning. Indefiniteness is a pedagogical offense that 
leads to much wasted effort. ‘‘Take the next 
three pages for to-morrow” may save a few min- 
utes now to the busy teacher, but such an assign- 
ment extracts a powerful toll later in aimless 
effort on the part of the pupils. 
To be definite the assignment should set a goal,” 
‘point the way to means of arriving at the goal, 
s and suggest a possible check on the accomplish- 
ment. Definiteness does not imply that the as- 
signment must always be made by the teacher. 
Often the most stimulating work is that in which 
the pupils determine the aims and the necessary 
means of attainment. The teacher’s responsibil- 
ityis to see that from a multiplicity of interests the 
pupils arrive at a definite task to be performed, 
and that each member of the class feels responsi- 
ble for his particular contribution 
The general assignment may be forward-look- 
ing in its scope, to aid the child in getting an en- 
larged view of the school activities; but the spe- 
cific assignment should be limited to a task within 
the pupil’s ability to accomplish in a given time. 
Successful achievement in a small portion of work 
begets self-confidence which encourages increased 
effort. 
No one acquainted with the capacities of chil- 
dren can sanction a “soft pedagogy” which never 
requires real effort. It is better to stimulate to 
  7

tasks just a little beyond their limit than to stifle | 
ability by never requiring a difficult performance. 
There is danger in both extremes. Only careful 
study of the particular situation will enable the 
teacher to follow a reasonable course. 
Every assignment should be related to past and | © 
future work. It should be the link in the chain of 
the learning process which binds the known to ‘ 5 
the unknown. That which has immediately pre- 
ceded should be recalled, that the assignment may 
  5 
have meaning; and the way toward which the les- ie 
son is moving should be pointed out. This may 
be done at the beginning of the recitation, if the 
work is of such a nature that advancement can be 
planned at this time. Coming at the beginning (7 
assures plenty of time for a definite understand- 
ing, and for possible questions. 
There are times, however, when the assignment 
should close the recitation to allow for the possi- 
ble change in purpose which the recitation may 
incur. In this case liberal time should be al- 
lowed, that the assignment may be noted; written, 
if necessary, in a book for that purpose kept by 
each pupil. No matter when the assignment is 
made, the important issue is that all doubt should % 
be removed in the mind of the pupil in regard to a \ 
definite procedure for advanced work. 
It is sometimes advisable to make portions of 
an assignment as each unit of subject-matter is 
 
-P-A-G-E-78
  64 PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING APPLIED 
studied. In the solution of a problem in geog- 
raphy this is especially helpful in enabling pupils 
to organize their work in the light of a specific 
purpose. In such an assignment there is often 
a different phase of work assigned to different 
groups or to different individuals, and it may be 
done better during the progress of the discussion 
than at the beginning or close of the recitation. If 
this plan is followed, a brief recall of the assign- 
ment is necessary at the close of the recitation to 
insure a complete placing of responsibility. 
Assignment illustrated. A fourth-grade teacher 
prepared her class for a reading lesson with the 
following assignment: 
“What did you like about the story which we read 
yesterday?” 
“We have been invited to read a story to the third- 
grade pupils. What are some of the characteristics of 
astory which you would want to read to your friends?” 
... “About what kind of people do you like to read?” 
... “Is there anything else to be considered besides 
the interesting events and the kind of characters?” ... 
“What would you name as necessary qualities in the 
language?” 
As the pupils responded and discussed the pos- 
sibilities the teacher listed their suggestions on 
the board. 
1. Good characters; usually children. 
2. Interesting events; plenty of action. 
8. Language expressive and easy to understand. rv!

“In your Riverside Fourth Reader you will find a 
story, ‘The Magic Prison,’ by Elizabeth Harrison. I 
am sure you will enjoy it. What problem are you 
going to keep in mind to answer when you have read 
it?” 
The problem as stated by a pupil is written on the 
board. 
“Ts this story one which we should want to read to 
the third grade?” 
Teacher: “On the board you will find a list of ques- 
tions which I think will help you to solve your prob- 
lem.” = 
Questions: 
1. Find five places in Part I and Part II that tell 
about Harweda’s character. 
2. What is the first instance of a change for the bet- 
ter in his character? 
8. What do you consider the most important event 
in the story? Give reasons. 
4. Be able to read expressively the passage which 
you think describes the most beautiful picture. 
5. What part of the story do you like best? Be able 
to read it so that your friends will like it. 
With the standards which they had mentioned, 
and these questions by the teacher, the pupils 
read the story not only for enjoyment, but with a 
definite purpose in mind which contributed to 
their interest in an analytical study of literature 
suited to their age and ability. 
Questioning. The child’s interest may be se- 
cured and held by a definite question which chal- 
lenges his attention. The indefinite question 
leaves the pupil in doubt as to what is expected,
-P-A-G-E-80
  66 PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING APPLIED 
or sends his mind into irrelevant wanderings 
which dissipate his mental energy and result in 
confused thinking. 
The pupils who were asked, “‘ What can you tell 
of the sugar maple?” did not know whether to 
describe its general appearance at different sea- 
sons of the year, or tell of its uses, or tell of it asa 
shelter for an interesting bird’s nest. What the 
teacher really wished to develop was the peculiar 
use of the sugar maple in furnishing sap for 
maple syrup and maple sugar. A more definite 
question would have been, “What do you con- 
sider the most important use of the sugar maple?” 
In answering this question, the pupil has an op- 
portunity for reflective thinking. He must recall 
the various uses of the sugar maple, evaluate 
each one, and be able to justify his answer. 
Simplicity is a necessary qualification of the 
question if it is to be readily understood. Words 
difficult of comprehension should be avoided, in 
order that the pupil’s attention may be directed 
to the point at issue. The teacher who asked a 
fifth-grade class, ““What was the Roman Empire 
noted for, the construction of national highways, 
or the excavation of subterranean passages?” 
was not only asking an alternative question, but 
was complicating the child’s thinking by the use 
of an unusual vocabulary. She was also encour- 
aging a wrong sense of values by emphasizing
-P-A-G-E-81
  ABILITY TO SECURE INTEREST . 67 
relatively unimportant issues. A better question 
would have been, “Why was the Roman Empire 
able to build such remarkable highways?” 
Thought-provoking questions. Questions 
should be thought-provoking. The question 
that can be answered by a simple ‘‘ Yes” or “No” 
does not lead to further thought. For this reason, 
“What is the central theme of Whittier’s Snow- 
Bound?” is a better question than, “Does Snow- 
Bound tell about New England city life or country 
life?” or, “Does Snow-Bound describe a family 
circle?” 
In the first situation the pupil must think of 
the various scenes of the story, select a possible 
hypothesis, evaluate each part of the poem, and 
finally accept or reject his hypothesis as his final 
conclusion. In the latter situations there is a 
wide chance for guessing, or, in the case of one 
incorrect answer, a second response could be cor- 
rect with little mental effort. Pupils soon learn 
to take advantage of this lack of foresight on the 
part of the teacher, and often receive credit for a 
correct answer without the stimulation that comes 
from real thinking. 
“Why is the Argentine Republic the most pro- 
gressive country in South America?” is a more 
thought-provoking question than ‘What do you 
know about the climate of Argentina?” The 
former has a wide scope and calls for reflective
-P-A-G-E-82
    68 PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING APPLIED 
thinking, while the latter demands merely infor- 
mational facts, without regard to relative values. 
The suggestive question. A question which 
hints broadly at the answer is an insult to the 
pupil’s intelligence, and can but result in weak- 
ened mental stability and in half-hearted or arti- 
ficial interest. The bright pupil can pretend in- 
terest and make reasonable response, while his 
mind is occupied with other matters which to him 
seem more important. 
“The purchase of Alaska was a good — what?” 
is not nearly so stimulating to good thinking as, 
“Why was the purchase of Alaska a good invest- 
ment?” 
The irrelevant question. This type of question 
wastes time and energy, and should have no place 
in school activities where good organization of 
thought and procedure is a recognized aim. To 
be able to see in advance where a certain question 
will lead in the discussion, and to direct the think- 
ing toward a specific goal, is a function of the suc- 
cessful leader. 
A teacher who wished to develop the problem, 
“Why does Great Britain need to look to other 
countries for much of her food supply?” asked a 
number of unimportant questions. For example, 
“What do you suppose is the principal food in 
Great Britain?” This question led to a discus- 
sion of foods in Scotland. When Scotland was
-P-A-G-E-83
  ABILITY TO SECURE INTEREST 69 
mentioned, a pupil described the dress of the 
Scotch. The teacher asked, “‘How many of you 
have heard a Scotch bagpipe?” When the reci- 
tation was ended, the pupils were no nearer a solu- 
tion of the original problem than when it began. 
True, they had acquired a few facts of interest, 
but these descriptions should have been post- 
poned until a later time, and the thinking for that 
period should have been directed toward the spe- 
cific aim. 
The sympathetic teacher is often led into ir- 
relevant by-paths, and thinks to hold interest 
by relating many items which are only remotely 
related to the subject under discussion. The pur- 
pose to unify subject-matter is commendable, but 
this should be done in an organized way and 
should not be left to the chance question, which 
distracts from the main purpose and fosters un- 
controlled thinking. 
The teacher should strive to ask a few pivotal 
questions which call for real thought, rather than 
many consecutive questions which seem to ad- 
vance the discussion, but in reality are causing 
the pupil to guess at a response which he thinks 
the teacher desires. 
To be a real stimulus to thinking, questions 
should be distributed so that every pupil has an 
opportunity to answer. All questions should be 
asked without specifying a particular pupil to
-P-A-G-E-84
  
  70 PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING APPLIED 
answer. When all have had a chance to think an 
answer, then a particular pupil may be chosen to 
recite. In this way all pupils feel responsible for 
continued attention and receive practice in reflec- 
tive thinking. 
Accepting and using answers. Closely related 
to ability in questioning is the ability to analyze 
the thought processes of the pupil, and the ability 
to appreciate his viewpoint. The timid pupil is 
often afraid to answer for fear of criticism, and the 
pupil who has studied zealously may not know 
how to relate his acquired knowledge to the point 
under discussion. 
To be able to accept and use the answer of 
every pupil, turning it to account toward the par- 
ticular aim in view, not only makes for group 
progress, but inspires confidence in the pupil and 
encourages renewed effort. While the teacher 
should beware of digression caused by thoughtless 
responses, she should be equally solicitous that 
each pupil be stimulated by the sympathetic un- 
derstanding of a teacher who can not only carry 
her own line of thought to fruition, but can esti- 
mate and guide the thought of each pupil. 
Too often the teacher asks a poorly worded 
question, and receives various unsatisfactory re- 
sponses to which she replies: “Yes, but that is 
not what I wanted.” ‘The pupil is not supposed 
to read the mind of the teacher. In such a case 
 
-P-A-G-E-85
  ' ABILITY TO SECURE INTEREST 71 
she should realize that her questioning is at fault, 
and assume the responsibility rather than dis- 
courage the child by a hasty dismissal or a curt 
criticism. 
Use of physical equipment. Knowing when 
and how to use blackboards, globes, maps, sup- 
plementary and reference books, pictures, lantern 
slides, and other illustrative materials is an asset 
which should not be overlooked by the teacher 
who would appeal to the child’s interest through 
the law of vividness and the principle of making 
school work concrete. Too many schools sacri- 
fice utility to a mistaken idea of a neat, orderly 
room, while useful material reposes on the shelf 
which should be in circulation among the pupils. 
The schoolroom should be an orderly workshop, 
where the workmen feel free to use any tool not in 
use by another. As a part of the preparation for 
any lesson, the teacher should ask herself: What 
illustrative material do I have, or can I get, which 
will help to make this lesson more meaningful? 
To facilitate its use all such material should be 
well organized, labeled, and kept in convenient 
shape for immediate use. One primary teacher, 
ever on the alert for usable materials, had col- 
lected a large number of pictures from magazines 
and advertising circulars, mounted them artisti- 
cally, sorted them according to the month in 
which they would be most appropriate for use, and
-P-A-G-E-86
  72 PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING APPLIED 
filed them with professional magazines for that 
month. Another teacher sorted and labeled by 
subjects, while still another found an alphabetical 
labeling more satisfactory. The important fea- 
ture in all of this procedure is that the teacher 
recognizes the importance of collecting materials, 
and that pupils are encouraged in its use. 
A fourth-grade teacher was attempting to cre- 
ate a feeling of responsibility when pupils, fol- 
lowing a former habit, asked: “May I use the 
stereographs?”’ or, “May I go to the wall map?” 
She replied: “This is your room. You need not 
ask permission to use materials which are not in 
use by another.” 
A study of cotton. These pupils were studying 
life in the Southern States, and were interested in 
the cotton industry. The teacher had selected 
and placed on a table, for convenient use, stereo- 
graphs illustrating the raising of cotton and also 
the manufacturing of cotton cloth. On another 
table were materials for making wall charts. Here 
the pupils had assembled various pictures of the 
cotton plant and of plantation life, samples of cot- 
ton cloth,-a-eotton boll, the best list made by a 
pupil of the uses-of-cetton, etc. These various 
materials were to be mounted as a permanent 
collection for the school, to help other classes in 
their study. 
An outline wall map was ready for the pupil
-P-A-G-E-87
  
ABILITY TO SECURE INTEREST 73 
who could locate a definite State to color with 
crayolas. He must first prove his ability by lo- 
cating and coloring the State on his individual 
desk outline map. 
Pupils were encouraged to collect postmarks 
from letters from the Southern cities; these were 
cut out and pasted on the wall map, in the correct 
location. 
When the various studies were completed, the 
most capable pupils were selected by the class to 
talk about the cotton industry to the pupils of 
another grade. The teacher closed the series of 
lessons with a lantern lecture, illustrating the 
entire life history of a gingham dress. 
It takes frequent checks and readjustments to 
secure the necessary courtesy and quiet study 
habits when such a school spirit is encouraged, 
but the returns in interested attitude are worth 
the effort. 
EDUCATIONAL PRINCIPLES INVOLVED IN 
THE FOREGOING DISCUSSION 
1. Interest must be spontaneous if work is to be satisfying. 
Efforts are seldom limited when interest is aroused, 
therefore the various instincts should be capitalized in 
the educative process. 
2. Since new knowledge must be acquired through rela- 
tion to that which is known, the teacher, in order to suc- 
ceed in stimulating desired effort, must know the ca- 
pacity, the interest, and the past experience of her 
pupils. 
8. The assignment of work should (a) be definite, (b) re-
-P-A-G-E-88
Th PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING APPLIED 
quire specific effort, (c) be given at a time when it is 
most meaningful to pupils, (d) receive sufficient time to 
emphasize its importance, (e) be within the pupil’s com- 
prehension, and (f) be adjusted to his abilities. 
. Questions are the keys which unlock the thinking 
process; they should, therefore, be definite, simple, and 
thought provoking. 
. The suggestive, alternative, and irrelevant question 
should be avoided. 
. Accepting and using the answers of pupils encourages, 
stimulates, and develops capable participation. 
. Impressions which are made vivid by the use of illus- 
trative materials are more lasting because of awakened 
interest. The resourceful teacher will collect and en- 
courage a generous use of supplementary and illustra- 
tive materials. 
. The school equipment is for use and should be so ar- 
ranged that it gives a maximum amount of service. 
The teacher should appeal to the visual imagery of the 
child by effective use of the blackboard. 
PROBLEMS FOR INVESTIGATION AND 
DISCUSSION 
. Suggest three ways in which you might secure the inter- 
est of a ten-year-old girl, who: was not interested in 
reading. 
. What known interests and knowledge would you ex- 
pect a fifth-grade pupil to have which you could use as 
an approach to the teaching of the problem: What can 
we do to provide sanitary care of the garbage? or, How 
can we help to prevent fires? 
. “You may take all of page 3 for to-morrow’ 's lesson in 
geography.” Why is this a poor assignment for a fifth- 
grade geography lesson on the problem: Of what value 
is the Panama Canal to the United States? 
. Give five pivotal questions which you might use in de- 
veloping a knowledge of the silk industry in the fourth 
grade. 
. Show by an illustration how a teacher may accept and 
use the answer of a pupil to increase his interest.

  CHAPTER VI 
GUIDANCE OR LEADERSHIP 
Ability to suppress teacher activity in favor of 
pupil activity. There are two dangers to which 
the teacher is liable when she assumes the posi- 
tion as leader. She may think of the school as an 
opportunity to display a newly acquired author- 
ity. To such a teacher 1.0., Y.0., might well be 
the insignia of membership, and “I order, You 
obey,” the understood slogan of this organization, 
which is supposed to exist for the purpose of giv- 
ing the child a true conception of democracy. 
There are many teachers, however, who have 
not such intentions, but who are equally mistaken 
in their attitude as leaders. This second type of 
teacher feels her responsibility as a leader and ex- 
erts herself to the utmost to achieve success. She 
goes to the opposite extreme and does for the 
pupil much that he would better do for himself, 
thereby depriving him of the confidence which is 
derived from self-expression. 
This fact is illustrated by the first-grade teacher 
who hangs up her pupils’ wraps, who sounds the 
phonetic word in an audible whisper, who places 
each pupil in line day after day, who repeatedly 
builds the unfinished lesson for the pupil who lacks 
persistence in working with letter cards, who dis- 
 
-P-A-G-E-91
GUIDANCE OR LEADERSHIP 7 
tributes and collects all materials instead of al- 
lowing the pupils this opportunity for the devel- 
opment of initiative and responsibility, and who 
tells each unrecognized word in the reading lesson 
instead of encouraging the pupil to sound it or re- 
call it from the list of “Sight Words.” 
This same attitude is found in the upper-grade 
teacher who asks ten rambling questions where 
one pivotal question is sufficient, who permits 
pupils to address the teacher instead of the class, 
who answers every question instead of encourag- 
ing class discussion, and who explains every de- 
tail instead of letting the pupil experience the joy 
of experimentation. 
Ability to stimulate without dominating. The 
teacher must learn to discriminate between the 
kind of attention that stimulates and that which 
stifles self-expression. It is admirable for the 
primary teacher to cultivate a sympathetic atti- 
tude that comprehends the inexperience and ten- 
der feelings of the six-year-old child. The ma- 
ternal attitude is to be commended, but it should 
not be misdirected. 
The pupil who is kindly guided into habits of 
neatness and efficiency, and encouraged to acquire 
higher standards of attainment, comes to look 
upon his teacher with greater esteem than if he is 
allowed to grow negligent toward his responsibil- 
ity for persistent effort.

  78 PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING APPLIED 
The teacher who can build a situation which 
arouses the pupils’ interest, stimulate each pupil 
to do independent thinking, and yet keep herself 
in the background, is the teacher who exhibits the 
best leadership. In such a teacher the pupils rec- 
ognize a source of information when in doubt as to 
procedure, and a good umpire when in doubt as to 
decisions. She stimulates without dominating. 
An illustrative lesson. The following lesson 
illustrates pupil activity stimulated by care- 
fully planned questioning on the part of the 
teacher. 
Grocrapny, GRADE 4-A 
Teacher’s aim: 
To teach the pupils to understand the symbols on a 
relief map. 
Pupil’s aim: 
To show by illustration where he would like to spend 
his vacation. 
Materials: 
Two pounds of putty, a round bottle, a sand pan, and 
water. 
Teacher: “Where would you like to spend your next 
vacation?” 
Pupils: 1. “On the farm.” 
2. “At the shore or beach.” 
. “I'd like to go to the mountains.” 
. “I am going to the lakes.” 
. “I want to be near a large river so that I 
can wade, swim, and go boating.” 
. “I'd like to be on an island like Robinson 
Crusoe.” orm Oo a

  GUIDANCE OR LEADERSHIP 79 
Teacher: “ What kind of farm would you like to be 
on?” 
Pupil: “A large farm with big fields.” 
Teacher: “Here is a piece of putty. Can you show 
the kind of farm with it? Roll it with the bottle.” 
(Pupil rolls putty out, one side higher than the other.) 
Teacher: ‘Why did you leave one side higher than 
the other?” 
Pupil: “A good farm should not be exactly level.” 
Teacher: “What do we call land that is almost 
level?” 
Pupil: “Land that is almost level is called a plain. 
So this is a plain.” 
Teacher: “Now can you make this piece of land so 
that Truman could spend his vacation here?” 
Truman: “I want to go to the mountains. I can 
punch up mountains on the high side.” (When this 
was done, a pupil suggested that he should make more 
than one range of mountains.) 
Teacher: “Willa wants to go to the lakes. How can 
she illustrate a lake?” 
Pupil: “She can hollow a place in the putty.” 
(Willa makes two lakes in the mountains.) 
Teacher: “Joseph wants to be near a river. Where 
should the river be?” 
Pupil: “It should start in the mountains and run 
down the slope.” 
Joseph: “It can start from the lake. I can make a 
thin mark with the scissors’ point. A river might 
have branches so I’ll show branches on this river.” 
Pupil: “He must make them all run down the slope. 
They cannot run uphill.” 
Teacher: ““Now, James, you wanted to go to the 
beach. How can you show that?” 
James: “May I pour water in that pan?” (He 
pours water into the pan until part of the shore line is 
under water.)
-P-A-G-E-94
80 PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING APPLIED 
Teacher: “What other suggestions have you?” 
Mabel: “TI can put a piece of putty out in the water 
to form an island. The lakes should have water in 
them, too.” 
Teacher: “What have we shown with the putty?” 
Pupil: “We have shown a plain, mountains, lakes, 
rivers, the shore, and an island.” ; 
Teacher: “A map that shows those things about the 
surface of a.country is called a relief map.” 
Pupil: “Is that the black map in the book?” 
Teacher: “Yes, on page 74. Will you read this map 
to-morrow?” 
Ability to arouse initiative. If the teacher re- 
linquishes the tendency to dominate, there must 
of necessity be another unifying force. Just what 
the substitute is to be depends upon her ability to 
arouse initiative in the pupils. By definition the 
pupil who has initiative has an aptitude to under- 
take or develop new enterprises. 
This aptitude may be encouraged by a sympa- 
thetic attitude on the part of the teacher toward 
the pupil’s viewpoint. She must surround him 
with those elements which stimulate a viewpoint, 
and give him an opportunity to express his 
| views and to defend his opinions. These stim- 
ulating elements are not always to be found in 
books. They are a combination of influences in- 
cluding — a problematic situation, a teacher who 
can aid without hindering, classmates who feel 
free to criticize and discuss, and an abundance 
of auxiliary aids, such as textbooks, reference 
 
-P-A-G-E-95
GUIDANCE OR LEADERSHIP 81 
books, illustrative materials, and experimental 
apparatus. 
Problem formulation and solving. In a sixth- 
grade geography lesson the teacher provided five 
stereograph views of scenes in the Pacific Moun- 
tains. Pupils were asked to examine each view, 
to list the item which was of greatest interest, and 
also to list something which they would like to 
know. Pupils were then given a few minutes to 
discuss possible sources of information, and de- 
cided that their various textbooks, reference 
books, and the back of the stereograph would be 
the most authentic references. One pupil volun- 
teered to bring railroad folders which she knew 
would help. The pupils were then left to their 
own research work, while the teacher was present 
to assist if needed. 
In the following recitation period each pupil 
read the question which he desired to have an- 
swered. When it was discovered that they were 
all along the same lines, the teacher suggested 
that they try to word a general problem which 
would include all of their questions. After sev- 
eral attempts, and thoughtful criticisms made by 
the pupils, the following problem was derived 
and written on the blackboard: “How have the 
three ranges of the Pacific Mountains been 
formed, and what has caused the volcanoes and 
earthquakes?”
-P-A-G-E-96
  82 PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING APPLIED 
The pupils, stimulated by their interest in the 
views and by the teacher’s confidence in their 
ability, had collected a creditable amount of ma- 
terial to verify their conclusions, and were pre- 
pared to discuss intelligently many items of in- 
terest listed during the study period. 
The following dialogue illustrates the initiative 
shown by the pupils, and the inconspicuous guid- 
ing power of the teacher: 
Teacher: “Ruth, you may read the problem as you 
have written it on the board.” (Ruth reads the prob- 
lem stated above.) 
Doris: “I read on the back of one of the views that 
the mountains of the Sierra Cascade Ranges had risen 
slowly until they were very high; and then I looked at 
the view No. 228 of the Sierra Range which showed 
how the mountains look now, but I couldn’t find what 
caused the mountains to rise.” 
Teacher: “Who can answer Doris’s question?” 
Paul: “When the earth was cooling on the outside, 
while the inside was yet hot, the mountains were 
formed by the earth’s crust being pushed upward. 
Everything expands when it gets hot, and has to have 
more room.” 
Marie: “I read that when the Sierras were formed 
the surface of the land was lifted up and tilted, and 
that made the sides of the mountain very rough.” 
Leslie: “I thought that the pictures made them look 
smooth in places.” 
Marie: “The water has worn them down a little at a 
time.” 
Willard: “There must have been a lot of water to 
have smoothed off the rough edges that way.” 
Vivian: “The western side of the Sierras receives 
plentiful rainfall.”
-P-A-G-E-97
  GUIDANCE OR LEADERSHIP 83 
Teacher: “I don’t believe that Vivian has quite 
answered Willard’s question.” 
Julian: “The Japan current brings warm winds full 
of moisture. When they are cooled as they rise to go 
over the mountains, it causes plentiful rainfall.” 
The lesson continued in this manner until the 
problem had been discussed from many angles, 
the teacher acting as guide, but encouraging the 
greatest freedom in discussion. The lesson closed 
as follows: 
Teacher: “Who will make a brief summary of the 
leading facts that we have learned in answering our 
problem?” 
Mildred: “We have learned that the Pacific Moun- 
tains are made up of three ranges; the Sierras, the Cas- 
cades, and the Coast Ranges.” 
Lela: “We have learned that the Sierras are old 
mountains, and that there are many volcanoes in the 
Cascades which have thrown out lava and made them 
grow.” 
John: “In the Coast Ranges there are often earth- 
quakes, which crack the earth and push it upward. 
That is what has made them grow.” 
Ability to develop leadership among pupils. 
Having surrounded the pupils with an atmosphere 
of freedom, the teacher should seek to develop 
leadership in her pupils. Any tendency toward 
originality or initiative should be encouraged. 
Little Charles, in the first grade, who brings 
several kinds of autumn leaves when the teacher 
has asked for oak leaves, deserves credit for his en-
-P-A-G-E-98
  84 PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING APPLIED 
deavor, instead of a frown from the busy teacher 
who does not know what to do with the surplus 
supply except hasty consignment to the waste- 
basket. 
Jack, in the fourth grade, has shown unusual 
ability in organization of games on the play- 
ground. This same executive ability may serve 
well in the classroom, if he is encouraged to head a 
team in a race for points in an arithmetic contest. 
Beatrice, in the sixth grade, has manifested an 
interest in sewing. She can be given an oppor- 
tunity to excel in costuming the characters for a 
play; while Donald, with a vivid imagination and 
a love for the literary pursuits, may head the com- 
mittee for writing the play. 
No teacher can afford to neglect the opportu- 
nity to study her pupils for signs of special abili- 
ties and interests, and to encourage leadership 
in various kinds of activities. The elementary 
school is not the place to make marked differenti- 
ation in duties assigned; rather a frequent shifting 
of responsibilities, to give each pupil a chance to 
discover his tendencies and aptitudes, should be 
the policy, with a quick recognition of originality, 
persistence, and achievement. 
Ability to guide pupils to sustained purposes. 
Life’s smaller positions are filled by countless 
numbers of individuals who were enthusiastic in 
their attempts, but lacked persistence in sustain-
-P-A-G-E-99
  GUIDANCE OR LEADERSHIP 85 
ing their original purpose until the task was com- 
pleted. 
Two extremes should be avoided if the teacher 
would attain success in this particular field of 
professional achievement. The pupil should be 
encouraged to undertake only that which there is 
reasonable assurance that he can complete, and 
then he should be held responsible for completing 
the task to the best of his ability. In limiting the 
task to the pupil’s ability, care should be taken 
that the pupil is permitted some opportunity to 
experiment else he cannot appreciate the worth of 
achievement. 
Interest in the particular task, sympathetic 
approval of teacher and classmates, helpful sug- 
gestions, and timely assistance are aids which may 
contribute to a pupil’s ability to sustain his pur- 
pose through to its fulfillment. 
To make persistence popular, commendation 
should not be meager, and in bestowing praise the 
teacher should discriminate as to the relative 
value of slight and difficult tasks. The perform- 
ance which is easy for one may require patient en- 
deavor on the part of another. Credit should be 
given according to the effort expended as well 
as for successful attainment. In the world of 
affairs, however, resulis are expected, and no 
amount of worthy effort can be accepted as a sub- 
stitute for successful achievement. It is well for
-P-A-G-E-100
  86 PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING APPLIED 
the pupil to realize and qualify for this rigid com- 
petition by early learning to complete an under- 
taken task. 
The pupil who was required repeatedly to take 
out the stitches and try again was more appreci- 
ative of the sewing-box which she finally com- 
_ pleted than the child to whom the work was less 
difficult, or the one who was allowed to call an un- 
finished box satisfactory. 
The boy who wrote his speech the third time, 
before it adequately represented a certain char- 
acter in a play, was gaining in power to accept 
criticism and to persist in an attempted task until 
success rewarded his efforts. 
Ability to lead pupils to work as an orderly social 
group. A first-grade teacher was trying to have 
ideal socialized procedure in herroom. The usual 
school subjects— reading, writing, music, art, and 
incidentally spelling and phonics— were to be the 
outgrowth of immediate interests. Her program 
could not be chopped up into ten minutes of this 
and ten minutes of that in the traditional style, 
but must fall into more natural divisions. 
For thirty minutes each morning the pupils had 
a free-activity period. At this time each pupil 
was busy at an activity which he had previously 
planned. Three were reading to the teacher to 
secure help in order that they might read better, 
and so enjoy the little “library” in one corner of
-P-A-G-E-101
GUIDANCE OR LEADERSHIP, 87 
the room. Four others were at the library table 
to continue a story begun yesterday. Two pu- 
pils were attending to the needs of a pet canary, 
replacing clean paper, food, and water in the cage 
in the usual way. One pupil was painting at 
a large easel, illustrating the story of “Little 
Black Sambo.” Each of four girls was weaving a 
doll’s hammock. Four boys were constructing a 
hotel building with building blocks. Three girls 
were building words with letter cards, while two 
others were writing on the blackboard. 
A few pupils were slow in getting materials 
from the lockers. ‘Two pupils became more in- 
terested in conversation than in their work. A 
dispute arose in regard to the use of a certain 
chair. When the disorder became noticeable, 
the teacher politely intervened, but always threw 
decisions upon the child. 
At the end of this free-choice period, the 
teacher began to play softly on the piano. Pupils 
immediately took this as a signal to stop work. 
Materials were put away, each child found a chair, 
carried it to the circle in front of the piano, and 
sat quietly to enjoy the music. When the quiet 
assured the teacher that all were ready, she turned 
to the children, and there followed a half-hour of 
planning. Each pupil was given an opportunity 
to tell of his work or of his difficulties, and to re- 
ceive help either from the teacher or from the
-P-A-G-E-102
  88 PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING APPLIED 
class. Sambo’s parasol must be the right color. 
The basin in the canary’s cage would better be 
tied, so that he could not turn it over so easily. 
The wool for the doll’s hammock should be cut in 
longer lengths. The story was too long to finish 
at one reading period. 
In this way the pupils were getting practice in 
oral English through a natural discussion of sub- 
jects in which they were interested. When each 
pupil was sure of a definite plan for the next day, 
having suggested a possible plan and received 
helps from the group, the teacher asked for sug- 
gestions for the pupils to whom she had spoken in 
regard to disorderly conduct. Several pointed 
suggestions in regard to courtesy and practical 
efficiency were received by the little offenders, 
probably with more seriousness than if they had 
come from the teacher. 
Other periods of work took their character 
largely from these first two periods in the morn- 
ing. The teacher realized her responsibility in 
surrounding the child with interesting materials, 
which would call for coéperative endeavor and for 
desirable social habits. Often as much time had 
to be spent in discussing and evaluating correct 
habits of work as in learning new words or letter 
forms. The pupils grew increasingly conscious 
of correct ideals, and proportionately skillful in 
forming desired habits, attitudes, and purposes.
-P-A-G-E-103
  GUIDANCE OR LEADERSHIP 89 
Work of a sixth-grade group. A sixth grade 
of thirty pupils had an assembly, with regularly 
elected officers and committees. They not only 
learned correct parliamentary practice, but felt 
the responsibility of socially desirable habits in 
the conduct of school affairs. 
While publishing a magazine as an English 
project, they became interested in the history of 
printing. They selected subjects which they 
thought would prove interesting, and appointed a 
leader for each of several groups. Each pupil de- 
cided upon the subject in which he was most inter- 
ested, and reported to the leader of that group. 
Each leader gathered his group together and 
planned how each one could help in developing 
the chosen topic. Pupils talked freely among 
themselves, consulting the teacher for sugges- 
tions whenever they felt the need of advice. 
When committees had been organized, standards 
of procedure had been established by each group, 
and suggestions for note-taking had been dis- 
cussed, the entire class went, without the teacher, 
to the school library, where the librarian, who had 
been previously consulted by the teacher, was 
ready to aid in every way. 
Books were ready on the tables for each leader 
to divide among the members of his committee. 
The teacher later went to the library to assist in 
economy of time and effort whenever the occa-
-P-A-G-E-104
een ee 
90 PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING APPLIED 
sion demanded. At the close of the hour the pu- 
pils returned to their classroom to discuss the 
results. Most of the pupils were enthusiastic, 
but there were many difficulties to be discussed. 
Much material which had been found did not 
“fit”? any topic, so there was a general reorgan- 
ization in the light of new interests. 
These periods of individual and committee 
work were always preceded or followed by con- 
ference periods, when standards of work and of 
conduct were discussed and evaluated: The 
teacher was the guide, suggesting and question- 
ing, to place responsibility and encourage initia- 
tive. 
These two examples of pupils working together 
in an orderly social group represent the type of 
school where the socialized recitation and the 
project method of work are accepted facts in pro- 
cedure. All schools, however, do not have mov- 
able furniture and equipment to compare with the 
first grade here described, nor do all sixth grades 
have an adequately equipped library. In many 
schools the first-grade teacher has forty-five in- 
stead of twenty-five pupils. 
While lack of equipment and a large enrollment 
are serious handicaps, it should not be inferred 
that the ability to work together in an orderly so- 
cial group is dependent upon any such exterior en- 
vironment. It is rather the result of the recogni-  
-P-A-G-E-105
  GUIDANCE OR LEADERSHIP 91 
tion on the part of the teacher that pupils can 
grow only through active participation, and a 
provision for activities in which the child can be- 
come interested. 
The conference period can be just as demo- 
cratic when presided over by the teacher as when 
directed by a pupil chairman. The essential ele- 
ment is a spirit of honest endeavor to improve the 
ways of working together. The teacher who has 
the respect and confidence of her pupils and is 
willing to give time to the study of her particular 
class can lead them to establish high ideals of co- 
operation and self-helpfulness instead of the de- 
pendent, careless, indifferent attitude so preva- 
lent in large classes. 
EDUCATIONAL PRINCIPLES INVOLVED IN 
THE FOREGOING DISCUSSION 
1. The teacher who has a true conception of democracy 
will recognize the importance of self-directed pupil ac- 
tivity. 
2. The dominating teacher suppresses pupil activity; 
therefore, to stimulate without dominating is the func- 
tion of the teacher. To surround the child with inter- 
esting materials is to furnish the best stimulus. 
8. Leadership may be encouraged in any grade by the 
recognition of originality and initiative. 
4. Generous commendation of work satisfactorily com- 
pleted is a strong incentive to the ambitious pupil, and 
emphasizes the necessity of sustaining the original pur- 
pose until the project is completed. 
5. The school program should be adjusted to meet the 
needs of a social group.

  PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING APPLIED " 
. Codperation and courtesy are essentials of successful 
group activity; and experimentation and discussion 
are valuable aids toward the realization of initiative 
and the development of good judgment. 
. If correct social habits are to be attained, they should 
be begun in the early days of school life, to enable the 
child to develop gradually during the formative period 
of his life. 
. Increasingly high standards should be maintained for 
evaluating and controlling conduct, as the child ad- 
vances in age and experience. 
. An orderly social group will work together to realize a 
common purpose; observing quiet courtesy, economy of 
time, codperation, and individual endeavor. 
Working together as an orderly social group depends 
upon thoughtful purposing as well as upon favorable 
exterior conditions. 
PROBLEMS FOR INVESTIGATION AND 
DISCUSSION 
. Why should the first-grade teacher emphasize pupil re- - 
sponsibility in every possible activity? 
. Describe a recitation in which there was alert interest 
and a maximum of pupil activity and participation, 
which was stimulated, but not dominated, by the 
teacher. 
. Describe a recitation in reading, in Grade 5 where the 
teacher encouraged initiative. 
. A sixth-grade teacher permitted a great deal of respon- 
sibility during the nature study period to be assumed 
by a boy, who had a particular aptitude for nature 
study, but was weak in other subjects. What would 
you expect the effect to have been upon the boy? 
Upon the class? 
. Tell of a situation in which a pupil failed to sustain his 
purposes, and of what methods the teacher might have 
used to have corrected this fault. 
. Make a daily program for a third-grade class, in which 
the large aim is purposeful activity growing out of im- 
mediate life interests.

  CHAPTER VII 
ABILITY TO STIMULATE REAL ‘THOUGHT 
Tue ability to think clearly is so obviously a req- 
uisite of successful living that it would seem un- 
necessary to emphasize it, were it not for the fact 
that so much of the prevalent school practice does 
not cultivate this phase of pupil efficiency. The 
teacher needs to analyze the school situation to 
see what elements will contribute to clear, force- 
ful thinking on the part of her pupils. 
Avoiding repetition of answers. One of the 
most pernicious faults of the young teacher is the 
habit of repeating the answer of the pupil. The 
practice often arises from a good intention — to 
encourage the child to free participation in the 
class discussion. There are better ways, how- 
ever, of securing pupil participation which do not 
incur harmful results. 
The habit of repeating answers is sometimes 
unconsciously employed to afford the teacher an 
opportunity to think what she is going to say 
next. This error can be avoided by more careful 
attention to planning and preparation in which 
she becomes so familiar with her intended pro- 
cedure that there is no need for hesitation. 
Just why is this repetition of answers so detri- 
mental to the thought processes of the pupils?
-P-A-G-E-109
  ABILITY TO STIMULATE THOUGHT 95 
It is belittling to the pupil’s self-confidence to 
feel that his answer must have repetition to make 
it emphatic. He will unconsciously feel that, no 
matter what he says, the teacher will repeat it 
and clarify it; therefore he neglects the keen dis- 
crimination which is demanded in specific think- 
ing and in expressing his thought in clear, forceful 
English. 
The class will gradually acquire the habit of 
inattention to a pupil’s answer, since they know 
that it will be repeated. This lax attention is 
unconscious, perhaps, but nevertheless harmful to 
the habit-forming individual. It is crushing to an 
alert, interested attitude to be subjected to the 
monotony of this parrot-like repetition of an- 
swers. It usually leads to indifference or to dis- 
orderly conduct. The habit is all the more to be 
regretted because it is often not realized by the 
teacher. It is one of “‘the little foxes that spoil 
the vines”’ of good teaching. 
A 2-B teacher was attempting to conduct an 
art appreciation lesson, combined with the teach- 
ing of oral English. Each pupil was provided 
with a miniature picture of “Feeding her Birds,” 
by Millet. The lesson began and continued for 
twenty minutes, as follows: 
“How many children do you see in the pic- 
ture? 
“Yes. There are two children in the picture.
-P-A-G-E-110
96 PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING APPLIED 
“Who is with them? 
“Yes. Their mother is with them. 
“What do the little girls wear on their heads? 
“Yes. They are wearing caps on their heads.” 
This teacher had many good qualities, but was 
particularly weak in the art of questioning; and 
because of this weakness she had contracted the 
habit of repeating answers. 
A better procedure. Another teacher with the 
same aims in mind asked the following questions, 
and aroused real thought by holding the pupil to 
the responsibility of making himself heard and 
understood. 
“How does a mother bird feed her nestlings?” 
Several pupils responded until the important 
facts were all mentioned. ‘The teacher occasion- 
ally reminded a pupil to speak more clearly by 
saying, “Arthur did not hear you,” or, “Mary, 
do you understand what John means?” and, 
“Can you describe it so that she will understand, 
John?” 
Each pupil realized that his contribution was 
necessary to the discussion; he also felt that what 
he said would have to serve a practical purpose; 
that it was not merely a “fill-in” to give the 
teacher a chance to talk. 
The teacher then asked: “‘ Why do you suppose 
that the artist, Millet, gave this name to his pic-
-P-A-G-E-111
ABILITY TO STIMULATE THOUGHT 97 
ture?” (Teacher turns to the blackboard and 
writes the title and the name of the artist.) 
After several suggestions, by which the pupils 
showed that they were studying the picture for 
an answer that really had meaning, the teacher 
asked: “‘ What is different in this picture from the 
things which you are used to seeing?” 
The pupils then began to observe and to de- 
scribe the dress, the house, the manners and cus- 
toms, of these people in comparison with their 
own. This led to the question by a pupil: 
“Where did these people live?” It was then 
that the teacher added her contribution. She 
told in a simple, attractive manner the story of 
French peasant life, and very briefly something of 
Millet’s life. 
At the close of the recitation the pupils had 
acquired a real interest in the picture from a 
child’s viewpoint. They were then allowed to 
mount the picture, and the next day each child 
made a raftia frame for his picture and took it 
home as the first of his collection of real art. 
Not once did the teacher find it necessary to 
repeat an answer. Instead, each pupil addressed 
the class when speaking, and was questioned or 
criticized by the pupils if they did not hear or 
agree with him. 
Encouraging the codperative type of recitation. 
Any recitation where teacher and pupils are oc-
-P-A-G-E-112
98 PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING APPLIED 
cupied with school work is to some extent social. 
There are all degrees, however, of social activity. 
A brief review of the history of elementary educa- 
tion will reveal the fact that emphasis upon in- 
dividual activity and development grew out of 
the desire to give the child an opportunity for 
self-expression, and incidentally to enable the 
teacher to ascertain the amount of facts which 
had been retained. To the extent that the reci- 
tation furnishes this opportunity for self-expres- 
sion, it is good; but retaining the good elements in 
a long-used procedure should not blind us to the 
advantages to be gained by acquiring new meth- 
ods of instruction which involve a greater degree 
of group activity. 
The codperative type of recitation stimulates 
thought, because it arouses the interest of the 
pupil by appealing to his instinct of gregarious- 
ness. By nature people like to work together. 
The traditional school practice of eliminating all 
communication deprives the pupils of a natural 
means of acquiring knowledge. It also sets apart 
school activities from the usual pursuits as some- 
thing limited, and therefore fosters an attitude 
of restraint which is not conducive to good think- 
ing. 
The approval of others is a strong incentive to 
vigorous thinking. Naturally, the pupil who is 
competing to win the approval of thirty class-
-P-A-G-E-113
  ABILITY TO STIMULATE THOUGHT 99 
mates must spend some time in investigating his 
subject and in organizing his thoughts, providing 
that the class has been led to hold high standards 
in this element of work. 
Too often the teacher, in her anxiety to secure 
a desired response, will call on the superior pupil 
who is likely to answer correctly, thus depriv- 
ing the indifferent pupil or the timid pupil of an 
opportunity for expression. For the same reason 
the talkative pupil, the aggressive pupil, or the 
one with an attractive personality will monopo- 
lize the recitation. Pupils soon recognize this 
weakness on the part of the teacher, and become 
increasingly careless in their attitude toward or- 
ganized thinking. 
Securing reports of problems or parts of proj- 
ects by individuals. In the codperative type of 
recitation the entire class is engaged in the solu- 
tion of a problem which demands the combined 
efforts of all. The superior pupil may be given a 
chance for leadership, but the work is so divided 
that each pupil is responsible for a definite part of 
the work. He must report on the results of his 
search for material, or upon the experiment which 
he has undertaken, or upon the equipment which 
he is to supply. 
A sixth grade, while planning an Oriental ex- 
hibit, wished to make an attractive Japanese 
booth. They had recently been entertained by a 
 
-P-A-G-E-114
  
  100 PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING APPLIED 
Japanese operetta, presented by the fourth-grade 
pupils, and quite naturally hoped that they might 
prepare something which would show more ex- 
tensive knowledge. The teacher agreed with them 
that a sixth grade should be able to do more read- 
ing, and asked: ‘“‘How will you plan your work?” 
After various suggestions they decided to ap- 
point a committee of three to select books from 
the library that would furnish information about 
Japan, while all pupils were to seek help at home. 
At the next recitation period this committee gave 
a brief account of their experience in the library, 
and explained the materials which they had col- 
lected. Several pupils had found books and 
magazines at home. One had brought pictures of 
Japan, while one had worked with the teacher to 
select stereographs that were appropriate. The 
pupils were then left to their own interests for an 
entire study period, each one to gain information 
which most interested him. A quiet exchange of 
materials was encouraged during this time. 
The teacher began the next recitation with the 
question: 
“What topics about Japan do you think would 
interest the fourth grade?” 
Different pupils suggested the following topics: 
1. Japanese holidays. 
a. The Flag Festival. 
b. The Doll Festival.
-P-A-G-E-115
  ABILITY TO STIMULATE THOUGHT 101 
2. Japanese industries. 
a. Rice culture 
b. Cormorant fishing. 
c. Raising silkworms. 
8, What the Japanese make from bamboo. 
4, Japanese art. 
5. Japanese schools. 
6. Japanese government. 
7. Odd customs. 
The pupils who had shown sufficient initiative 
to formulate a topic were appointed as leaders of 
a group, and each pupil in the room was given an 
opportunity to select the topic which interested 
him, and was permitted to work with that group. 
The topics were discussed in class when each 
pupil had an opportunity to contribute the result 
of his reading. 
As the work progressed a Japanese student 
from a near-by university was invited to talk to 
the class about his country and its people. Later 
a pupil wrote him a note of thanks, and invited 
him to attend the Oriental exhibit. 
After discussing the best way to entertain the 
fourth grade, the class decided that the material 
could best be presented by each pupil writing 
a composition, the best paper in each group to 
be placed in the Oriental exhibit, and the best 
speaker in each group should be selected to talk 
about his particular subject. 
In this way every pupil was given an oppor-
-P-A-G-E-116
  102 PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING APPLIED 
tunity to participate to the limit of his ability. 
He was stimulated to do independent thinking 
that he might contribute an acceptable paper. 
He not only accumulated knowledge that was de- 
sirable, but acquired a needed practice in the or- 
ganization of ideas, also a necessary drill in oral 
and written English, which included spelling, 
penmanship, and the ability to read for informa- 
tion as well as for pleasure. 
Stimulating pupils to become efficient critics of 
their own work. When pupils are exposed to the 
publicity of group discussion and criticism, they 
usually react according to disposition or previous 
experience. They may become resentful of criti- 
cism and discouraged in their efforts, and conse- 
quently lose interest in school activities; or they 
may profit by this new stimulus and work with 
increased effort. 
The slow, dull child belongs to the first class. 
He needs help in learning to criticize his own work, 
in order that he may compete with some degree of 
fairness. Assigning smaller tasks, or less difficult 
work, and affording an opportunity for him to 
work with more capable pupils, will enable him to 
become more critical of his own methods of work 
and of his own degree of achievement. 
The bright pupil who has been pampered and 
has developed an undue amount of egotism needs 
the stimulus of codperative criticism, to show him 
 
-P-A-G-E-117
ABILITY TO STIMULATE THOUGHT 108 
the contrast of his own methods and attitudes 
compared with the industrious, self-effacing pupil 
who is efficient and ready to share his achieve- 
ments. 
Besides encouraging the codperative type of 
recitation, with its favorable opportunities for 
comparison, the teacher should plan definite 
means of stimulating pupils to become efficient 
critics of their own work. She should lead them, 
day by day, to establish standards which will give 
them criteria for judging their own attainment; 
she should also guide them into an habitual ref- 
erence to those standards in order to measure 
achievement in facts learned, in habits acquired, 
in skills mastered, or in ideals realized. 
She should study to direct the pupil’s attention 
to specific difficulties, point the way toward im- 
provement, and create a consciousness that ra- 
tional procedure is expected. For example, she 
may ask: 
“What principle of good English have you 
learned in to-day’s lesson?” “What did you 
find that you lacked to-day in attempting to 
solve that problem in long division?” ‘‘What 
part of that word in the spelling lesson did you 
get wrong?” ‘‘Who has shown the best judg- 
ment in selecting materials for the solution of our 
problem in geography?” ‘‘Why did you select 
that particular item in history to prove that Lin-
-P-A-G-E-118
104 PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING APPLIED 
coln was justified in issuing the proclamation of 
emancipation?” ‘‘Can you state your thought 
in one complete sentence?” 
The pupil who is daily held responsible for 
reasons for his statements, and who is expected to 
analyze his procedure to ascertain the strength 
and weakness of his efforts and the cause thereof, 
is acquiring habits of self-criticism which will en- 
able him to do independent thinking, and will in- 
spire him to higher ideals of conduct. 
Stimulating pupils to reorganize their work and 
make new investigations. Pupils are often list- 
less in attacking work, and apparently indifferent 
toward continued progress in the same subject be- 
cause of no responsibility in selecting either sub- 
ject or method. It is an easy matter to secure 
continued application to a problem in which there 
is vital interest. When working together the 
pupils become inspired by the spirit of emulation; 
they have ideas to be expressed, purposes to be 
carried out. The teacher’s function here is to en- 
courage the weak, suggest new avenues of think- 
ing to the strong, calm the boisterous, and stim- 
ulate the timid — in short, she is the unifying 
force which keeps the class moving toward a 
chosen goal. 
When a pupil has an interest in a certain phase 
of the subject, he should be encouraged to report 
to the class his progress in finding materials and
-P-A-G-E-119
  ABILITY TO STIMULATE THOUGHT 105 
in organizing information. His enlightenment is 
often provided by the questions or criticisms of 
his classmates, and he is made to realize that his 
first attempt has been superficial. He is encour- 
aged to renewed effort by the desire to win ap- 
proval, or by a new interest awakened by the 
suggestions of the class. 
The pupils of a 5-A class were explorers in the 
“Dark Continent.” They were taking an im- 
aginary trip across the Sahara Desert. Russel 
had selected as his topic, “Preparations and 
Equipment for our Trip.” He had become in- 
terested in the savage warfare of the various 
tribes, so he emphasized the need of guns, of an 
escort of Moorish soldiers, of tents, of canned 
goods, and other camping equipment and sup- 
plies. His report was interesting and well given, 
but Oliver immediately started a new interest 
and revealed the need of further preparation by 
the question: “Russel, can you tell us something 
about the camels which we will have?” Oliver 
supplies a few facts, but the class soon ask so 
many questions that he admits insufficient prep- 
aration. Both he and Russel agree to be ready 
next day with more detailed descriptions; the 
class meanwhile has received an object lesson in 
the breadth of preparation necessary to report 
adequately on an apparently simple question. 
As the discussion continued, different pupils
-P-A-G-E-120
  
  106 PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING APPLIED 
used the names Mohammedans, Bedouins, Tua- 
regs, Arabs. Margaret finally set a new problem 
for investigation when she asked: “Just who are 
the natives of the Sahara Desert? I don’t under- 
stand the difference between these people who 
have been mentioned?” Pupils who had men- 
tioned these names were unable to explain very 
much about them, so their report needed reorgan- 
ization and continued investigation. 
Stimulating the class to draw conclusions care- 
fully. The ability to set up a goal, select means 
of achieving that goal, and to persist in compari- 
sons, eliminations, and selections until the correct 
conclusion is reached, is a complex process needed 
in every field of human activity. The lawyer, 
physician, carpenter, cook, seamstress, teacher, 
and statesman must be able to draw conclu- 
sions carefully, if successful work is to be accom- 
plished. 
The pupil who “jumps at conclusions” is pres- 
ent in almost every class, and also the “crooked” 
thinker, who arrives at the wrong conclusion. 
The child who is inclined to form hasty judgments 
may be checked by the class criticisms described 
in the preceding paragraphs. When more than 
ordinarily disposed to this error, the pupil needs 
the wise, firm counsel of the teacher who suggests 
auto-criticism by such questions as: “Have you a 
reason for your answer?” or, “Why did you de-
-P-A-G-E-121
ABILITY TO STIMULATE THOUGHT 107 
cide in that way?” or, “Tell us something to 
prove your opinion.” 
Often the wrong conclusions are not the result 
of no thinking, but of biased thinking. The pupil 
becomes absorbed in one phase of the question. 
He eagerly selects the items of information which 
contribute to that viewpoint, and ignores equally 
valuable but less interesting information which 
might change his opinion. 
The successful debater soon learns that success 
depends upon knowing not only one phase of a 
question, but in gleaning every bit of information 
from all angles of opinion, that he may be able to 
meet the argument of his opponent with convinc- 
ing proof. Such an attitude is highly desirable in 
the ordinary class activities, that pupils may early 
learn the value of correct conclusions and the im- 
portance of an open-minded attitude. 
An illustration from government. The teacher 
of an eighth grade was creating a fine attitude 
toward investigation and discussion through the 
development of a history lesson when the class 
was studying government. For this particular 
recitation the pupils were to discuss local election 
issues. They had been asked to notice advertise- 
ments of the different city factions as they ap- 
peared in newspapers or on billboards. 
As the pupils described or showed the adver- 
tisements, the teacher explained the meaning,
-P-A-G-E-122
    
108 PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING APPLIED 
with occasional supplement by the pupils. The 
teacher then mentioned and showed newspapers 
that had been brought to class by different pupils 
in support of various candidates. 
The first point raised for discussion was the ex- 
travagance of the present administration. The 
teacher cautioned the pupils that all discussions 
must be tempered by open-mindedness. Free 
discussion ensued in support of and against each 
proposition. 
Without attempting to settle the opinions of 
the class, but impartially insisting that there are 
always two views to be considered, the teacher 
called attention to another point at issue. The 
apparent dishonesty and vacillating policy of one 
candidate then came up for discussion. Papers 
were produced to show that this candidate had 
strong support. 
The discussion was polite, stimulating in that 
each speaker had a reasonable basis or proof for 
his opinion, and important in that these pupils 
were acquiring an attitude of intelligent interest 
in civic affairs, and the habit of basing conclu- 
sions upon facts. 
EDUCATIONAL PRINCIPLES INVOLVED IN 
THE FOREGOING DISCUSSION 
1. Since clear, forceful thinking is necessary to successful 
living, the teacher should encourage the habit in all 
school activities.

Repetition of the answer of a pupil should be avoided, 
as it stifles initiative and destroys interest, and thereby 
causes inattention. If repetition is necessary it would 
better be by a pupil in order to create a proper feeling 
of responsibility. 
. Careful attention to planning and preparation will en- 
able the teacher to stimulate the class to participation, 
without resorting to the practice of repeating answers. 
The codperative type of recitation stimulates thought 
by appealing to the social instincts of gregariousness 
and approval of others. 
The traditional practice of forbidding all communi- 
cation in the classroom is not supported by psycholog- 
ical laws, and should be modified to meet the needs of a 
social group. 
The report by the individual pupil is a means of check- 
ing his work. It reveals the thoroughness of his prepa- 
ration, and furnishes a stimulating opportunity for self- 
expression. 
Individual research on a problem of special interest af- 
fords an opportunity for leadership and for maximum 
participation; and group discussion may result in in- 
creased efficiency, if a right attitude is developed 
toward criticism. 
To encourage the pupil to measure his methods of work, 
and his achievement by comparison with established 
standards, is to foster the habit of auto-criticism which 
is needed for successful competition. 
The teacher should hold the pupil responsible for his 
statements and decisions and for the selection of sub- 
ject-matter and methods, to the extent of his ability, 
that he may grow in the power to do independent 
thinking. 
The codperative or socialized recitation furnishes the 
most natural means of stimulating interest in the re- 
organization of knowledge and in renewed investigation. 
Wrong conclusions are the result of hasty or of preju- 
diced thinking, and should be discouraged in school pro- 
cedure. Pupils should be encouraged to collect infor- 
mation, weigh opinions, and maintain an open-minded 
attitude toward all questions.

CHAPTER VIII 
STIMULATING HABIT FORMATION 
“We are all creatures of habit” has become a 
truism because of the fact that the life of every 
individual is largely controlled by the habits 
which he has formed. Contrary to popular opin- 
ion habit may prove to be as great an asset as it 
has proved to bea hindrance. There are as many 
desirable habits which should be cultivated as 
there are harmful habits to be eliminated. 
The progress of civilization has been due to the 
acquired habits of thinking individuals who so 
mechanized the routine affairs of life that they 
could devote the large portion of their time to cre- 
ative thinking, which, in itself, is subject to the 
laws of habit formation. 
Since the school is concerned with the complete 
welfare of the child, the teacher must not only be 
prepared to minister to his academic training, 
she must be able to guide in his threefold develop- 
ment — physical, social, and intellectual. She 
must realize the importance of building up posi- 
tive habits as well as overcoming undesirable 
tendencies. 
The presence or lack of desirable habits is not so 
often due to heredity as to environment. Hered-
-P-A-G-E-126
    112. PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING APPLIED 
ity may, and probably does, determine capacity; 
but environment determines achievement. It 
matters greatly, therefore, with what influences 
the child is surrounded during the formative years 
in the elementary school. 
Laws of habit formation. There are a few 
laws which govern habit formation, no matter in 
what phase of life the habit is to be applied. The 
desired habit must be launched with enthusiasm, 
practiced with regularity, and never be allowed to 
lapse until it becomes firmly fixed. 
The first-grade teacher who wished her pupils 
to acquire the habit of sounding phonetic words, 
as an aid to reading, created enthusiasm by read- 
ing a part of an interesting story. Pupils were 
told that they could finish it if they would learn 
to sound the difficult words. Nor did she depend 
upon this motive alone to keep up enthusiasm. 
She varied the phonetic drill by introducing the 
play element. The phonograms were each writ- 
ten on envelopes, a pupil postmaster delivered the 
mail, giving a “letter” to each child who could 
correctly sound the “address.”” Each pupil finds 
in his envelope a phonetic word which he reads, or, 
later, he finds a sentence in which there are sev- 
eral phonetic words, which he must sound before 
he can read his mail to the class. 
Every day the teacher provides new devices for 
holding the interest, so that the pupil receives
-P-A-G-E-127
STIMULATING HABIT FORMATION . 118 
practice in this desired habit of sounding letters 
and words until he becomes skillful in their use. 
The. habit has been launched with enthusiasm 
and practiced with regularity. The teacher must 
now see that the habit is used correctly. It must 
be applied to the intended reading or it will lapse 
into disuse. Many teachers have a phonetic drill 
period, but fail to apply the last of the laws of 
habit formation. They expect the pupil to read 
day after day without helping him to apply the 
newly acquired skill. They tell the phonetic word 
instead of having the pupil sound it. 
A 2-A teacher was observing these three laws of 
habit formation when she taught the arithmetical 
combinations in nine. Pupils were given pegs, 
and asked to count out nine with which to work. 
They were then encouraged to illustrate a story 
with the pegs, in which they would have a com- 
bination equaling nine. 
A pupil arranged the pegs in two groups, four 
and five respectively, and told this story: “There 
were five roses blooming on our rosebush yester- 
day, and four more came out to-day. There are 
now nine roses.” He was then allowed to write 
the story in figures on the board, 5 + 4 = 9, and 
return to his desk to make another story using a 
different combination. 
This lesson was followed by a drill period when 
the teacher had various combinations on the
-P-A-G-E-128
  
  114 PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING APPLIED 
blackboard, in which missing numbers were to be 
supplied by the pupils; for example, 5 + ? = 9, 
or ?+4=9. Several sets of these combina- 
tions were ready to be used in a relay race for 
points. The first pupil in each of two rows starts 
at a given signal, completes one combination, and 
passes the chalk to the next pupil in hisrow. The 
row which finishes correctly, first, wins a point. 
The pupils were then interested in making a 
cardboard box to be used as a receptacle for seeds, 
in the construction of which they must use this 
newly acquired knowledge. 
In this series of lessons a very necessary habit 
was developed with enthusiasm until it had mean- 
ing. It was practiced day after day until it be- 
came automatic, and was used in practical situa- 
tions so that it was not allowed to lapse. 
Other laws related to habit formation. An- 
other law which every teacher should observe if 
she would secure economy in the learning process 
is the law of exercise and effect. Habit formation 
is greatly influenced by frequency, recency, and 
vividness. That response which we hope to make 
habitual should be firmly fixed in the pupil’s 
mind so that he realizes its worth and attractive- 
ness. The retention of the desired response as a 
permanent habit depends upon the frequency of 
repetition and the recency of impression. 
We tend to repeat those responses which have 
 
-P-A-G-E-129
  STIMULATING HABIT FORMATION *" 115 
brought satisfaction, and to discontinue those 
which have been attended by annoyance. 
It is the teacher’s privilege to so study her 
pupils that she may guide them into those activ- 
ities which will bring a resultant satisfaction, and 
to encourage those habits which will bring satis- 
faction rather than annoyance. These may range 
from those things which appeal to the child’s orig- 
inal nature of collecting, manipulating, emulat- 
ing, contesting, and the like, to the more mature 
feeling of satisfaction in obstacles overcome, or in 
being identified with conduct which is approved 
by one’s conscience. 
The formation of correct physical habits. Mod- 
ern educational theory recognizes the responsibil- 
ity of the school in furnishing informational facts 
in regard to hygiene and the formation of correct 
physical habits, but there are still many teachers 
who neglect their opportunity to contribute to the 
welfare of the child, while they offer the excuse 
that the curriculum is too crowded, or that such 
training belongs to the home. Both of these ex- 
cuses are based upon truth, but neither of them 
can be accepted if the school is to serve its in- 
tended function of — the pupil a successful 
and happy life. 
The same laws operate in the formation of 
physical habits as in other fields, and since there is 
almost universal ignoranceand neglect along these 
 
-P-A-G-E-130
  116 PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING APPLIED 
lines in the home, it is all the more imperative that 
the school should take the initiative. The teacher 
can meet her responsibility by introducing infor- 
mation and fostering those habits which are ap- 
propriate as the child advances in age and ex- 
perience, gradually securing the codperation of 
the home. 
Many devices are now being used to arouse en- 
thusiasm and maintain interest in health habits 
until they become a natural part of the child’s life. 
A health creed printed on an attractive card, 
signed by the pupil and kept as one of his own 
possessions, is often a stimulus to the formation 
of correct health habits. If the expense of such a 
card is prohibitive, pupils may be encouraged to 
form their own health creed, and be guided in its 
daily application. 
The fourth-grade pupils who conducted a daily 
health inspection were acquiring right ideals 
and correct habits under conditions which in- 
creased their knowledge and developed a feeling 
of personal responsibility. 
On the blackboard was a chart containing the 
name of each pupil, with a blank space for a daily 
record under the following heads: 
Clean face, hands, and nails. 
Hair, clean and neatly combed. 
Teeth, brushed before and after breakfast. 
Glass of water before breakfast. 
No coffee for breakfast; cocoa or milk if possible.  
-P-A-G-E-131
  
STIMULATING HABIT FORMATION 117 
A pupil inspector for each row reported and 
checked daily for his row, thereby using friendly 
competition in a contest for points. At a regu- 
larly appointed time the class received instruc- 
tion in personal and community hygiene. This 
class gave a poster show, to which the entire 
school was invited. Each pupil exhibited an at- 
tractive poster which he had made, emphasizing 
a phase of health, with a pleasing slogan and an 
attractive picture to illustrate the idea. At the 
same time a play written by the pupils was given 
in which the characters were represented as foods, 
each one telling of his use or neglect by Jack and 
Mary, two school children who knew, but did not 
always practice, good health habits. 
These pupils were starting their health habits 
with enthusiasm, practicing them with interest, 
and applying them to daily living because of the 
daily check, which was a daily reminder until 
such a time as the habit proved its own merit and 
made its appeal because of satisfaction in the re- 
sults. 
The daily “setting-up” exercises for corrective 
purposes are too important to be omitted, as is so 
often done that the class may have five more min- 
utes on geography or arithmetic. It is the regu- 
larity which benefits, as well as fixes the habit. 
Correct sitting and standing posture, correct 
breathing and walking, cleanliness, sanitation in 
 
-P-A-G-E-132
    118 PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING APPLIED 
handling materials, avoidance of dust, importance 
of fresh air and exercise, necessity of proper kinds 
of clothing, and simple first aid, are subjects upon 
which the pupil should receive authentic informa- 
tion and systematic practice, both at home and at 
school. 
A definite program of outdoor games should be 
a part of every teacher’s plan, that the pupil may 
be encouraged to acquire a wholesome participa- 
tion in activities which may contribute to a profit- 
able use of leisure time. 
The formation of correct social habits. Since 
the school is the society in which the child spends 
most of his time, he should be conscious of certain 
standards which should control his social habits. 
The term “social” here is meant to include all of 
those habits which enable the members of society 
to work together in harmony for the welfare of 
each individual and of the group. 
Any teacher should be able to analyze the needs 
of her particular class and emphasize those ele- 
ments which need attention. The specific meth- 
ods used must depend upon the age and experi- 
ence of the pupils. The social standards of dif- 
ferent school localities will differ widely. The 
teacher who finds herself in a school where the 
standards of the home do not contribute to the 
social welfare of the school has a great privilege 
and responsibility in establishing ideals and in
-P-A-G-E-133
  
  STIMULATING HABIT FORMATION 119 
achieving practical applications. Whatever the 
social conditions, there is always opportunity to 
help the individual to a fuller development in 
self-control, self-reliance, courage, independence, 
cheerfulness, promptness, industry, concentra- 
tion, perseverance, diligence, honesty, loyalty, 
truthfulness, and in recognition of the rights of 
others as manifested by patriotism, respect, obe- 
dience, justice, kindness, courtesy, thoughtful 
generosity, and codperation. 
These characteristics can best be developed in 
connection with the regular work of the class- 
room, but attention to them should in no sense be 
merely incidental. 
The use of a pupil score card in social character- 
istics, where the pupil rates himself, or where the 
teacher rates him for the regular report to parents, 
often contributes to the conscious improvement 
of the pupil. 
A certain high school keeps on file for each 
pupil a “Personality Record,” which is the com- 
bined judgment of all teachers in the following 
items: native ability, application, initiative, fair 
play, courtesy, clean-mindedness, public spirit, 
codperation and loyalty, leadership, and reliabil- 
ity. At the end of the senior year the student is 
checked under each item as to whether he ranks 
above average, average, or below average. Such 
a record might well be issued with the monthly re-

    120 PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING APPLIED 
port of grades, that the pupil might be stimulated 
by satisfaction to increased effort or spurred by 
annoyance to eliminate the cause of failure. 
An elementary school reserved a page of the 
quarterly report card for a record of “Habits and 
Attitudes Which Make for Efficiency.” The fol- 
lowing items were checked if improvement was 
noticeable: 
1. Becoming more thoughtful — asks pointed ques- 
tions. 
2. Gaining in self-reliance. 
8. Shows increased desire to improve in neatness, 
courtesy, and punctuality. 
4. Developing greater power to attack work ener- 
getically. 
5. Shows a growing tendency to exert a helpful in- 
fluence in the group. 
The absence of a check mark did not mean that 
the pupil was developing the opposite habit or at- 
titude. It did mean, however, that no marked 
tendency to improve in these respects was ob- 
servable. Since one of the primary purposes of 
the school is to strengthen useful habits and atti- 
tudes already partially formed, and to develop 
new ones which are socially desirable, such a sys- 
tem acts as a stimulus to habit formation. It 
calls attention to some important traits, and is 
suggestive of a field in which the school is striving 
to promote growth. 
The teacher should learn the art of encouraging  
-P-A-G-E-135
| 
STIMULATING HABIT FORMATION 121 
rather than forbidding. She should avoid sec- 
tarian teaching, but should realize that “the 
school cannot be a preparation for social life ex- 
cepting as it reproduces, within itself, typical con- 
ditions of social life.” The child must be stimu- 
lated to realize his moral responsibility by doing, 
as well as by hearing what is good to be done. 
The alert teacher will recognize the value of sto- 
ries and poems in securing a desirable emotional 
attitude toward positive forces of character. 
Intellectual habits. Assuming that the forma- 
tion of correct physical and social habits will have 
a positive effect upon each other and upon intel- 
lectual behavior, there is still a particular field of 
habits which may be formulated or improved by 
careful guidance on the part of the teacher. 
How to study. What to study has, perhaps, re- 
ceived a far greater share of attention than how to 
study. A review of the study habits of any ten 
individuals will reveal certain elements which are 
rather commonly neglected, and which, when an- 
alyzed, are the bases of economical study habits. 
Pupils should become increasingly skillful in 
the ability to select specific purposes, to organize 
information in the light of these purposes, to sup- 
plement the thought of any author that reading 
may really be stimulating, to judge the worth of 
accumulated statements on a subject by compar- 
ison and analysis, to memorize the facts which are 
   
-P-A-G-E-136
  122 PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING APPLIED 
essential, to use his recently acquired knowledge 
in appropriate situations, and finally, to maintain 
a sense of his own individuality, at the same time 
remaining openminded to new suggestions. 
Finding and using materials. A very common 
cause of poor work is inability to find and use ma- 
terials. If the training in this element of study 
were to receive adequate attention from the kin- 
dergarten throughout the entire school life, the 
university student would not feel so handicapped 
in research work, nor would the men and women 
in every field of work feel their present limita- 
tions in adapting available resources to their 
needs. 
The child should early receive instruction and 
practice in finding materials needed for specific 
lines of work. He should, even in the kinder- 
garten, learn to handle materials, classify them, 
and know when and how to use them. 
In the first grade the child may as well learn to 
speak of his reader by name as to call it “the 
green book” or “‘my little book.” He should at 
this age learn to find the story by title and by page. 
He may also learn the names of a few favorite 
authors. Teachers are inclined to underestimate 
a pupil’s ability in the early years. They need 
help, of course, in-acquiring these unfamiliar hab- 
its, but they can easily add a few useful habits in 
connection with each subject. Careful inspection 
 
-P-A-G-E-137
  STIMULATING HABIT FORMATION 123 
and constructive criticism of all desk work aids in 
establishing correct habits of study in the primary 
grades. 
As the pupil advances he should have definite 
instruction in the use of indexes, tables of con- 
tents, glossaries, diagrams, illustrations, statistical 
tables, maps, and footnotes. He should have or- 
ganized, systematic study and practice in the use 
of the dictionary, standard encyclopedia, and 
other reference books. 
As early as the second grade pupils may profit- 
ably make use of the school and public library, if 
careful guidance is furnished in the selection of 
books. In all such beginnings of research work 
caution should be observed that the child is en- 
abled to find something definite that he can use; 
and that he is not discouraged by a mass of un- 
related materials. Careful direction of this phase 
of habit formation will give increasing returns in 
pupil activity and interest. 
The teacher often fails to realize the complexity 
of the difficulty which a pupil faces when he is 
asked to perform a given task. The accumula- 
tion of doubt and perplexity, as the pupil contin- 
ues to be the victim of this false assumption by the 
teacher of knowledge which he has never acquired, 
becomes appalling when analyzed. 
To illustrate: The complex symbolization con- 
nected with an intelligent understanding of maps
-P-A-G-E-138
    124 PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING APPLIED 
is a more intricate process than the teacher seems 
to realize, as she demands increasingly difficult 
tasks without ascertaining the pupil’s need of 
help. The understanding of even one kind of map 
calls for the formation of thousands of mental 
bonds. For example, the child must know that 
the top of the map represents north, with each of 
the other directions according. He must know 
the significance of heavy and of light-faced type; 
of the use of large and of small letters; of color as 
it is used to represent political divisions, or of ele- 
vations of the land, or to distinguish between land 
and water. He must know that certain lines 
represent meridians, and others parallels, with 
something of their significance. He must know 
the interpretation of the scale of miles and of the 
area key. He must know that a certain black, 
wavering line indicates a river; that the heavier 
portion indicates the mouth, and the consequent 
direction in which the river flows. He must know 
that certain broken lines indicate railroads or 
steamer routes; and so on and on through a com- 
plex system of habit formation which has to be 
readjusted and added to with every map which 
the child consults. 
What can be done to simplify this complexity 
and give the child the highest degree of efficiency? 
The teacher must keep constantly in mind the 
psychology of the learning process, that the pupil
-P-A-G-E-139
STIMULATING HABIT FORMATION = 125 
cannot comprehend “chunks” of learning, but 
must be guided carefully through the detailed 
steps, and gradually acquire skill in the use of 
each habit. 
The making of outlines and schedules of work. 
In a previous chapter we have considered the im- 
portance of an outline as an aid in organization. 
The pupil derives more benefit from the study of 
an outline which he has helped to make than from 
the outline furnished by the teacher. The teacher- 
made outline may be logical and present subject- 
matter in the best possible order from an adult 
viewpoint, but it does not afford the opportu- 
nity for growth in the powers of reasoning that 
is furnished by the outline which is compiled 
by the pupil from his own experience. The 
teacher can so guide the procedure that the pro- 
posed outline may be logical as well as psycho- 
logical. 
A fifth-grade class became interested in Hol- 
land, through a picture in their language textbook, 
and by reading the story of ‘“‘How Peter Saved 
the Dike.” When they asked how to learn more 
about these people their teacher suggested that 
they make a list of the things which they wanted 
toknow. As aclass exercise they derived the fol- 
lowing list, which served as a guide in studying 
about the people and also led to a study of the 
entire geography of Holland:

Homes.

. Games, 
Even young pupils can receive practice in mak- 
ing schedules of work, and thus learn the value of 
economy of time and effort. The daily program 
of the class work, kept on the blackboard for fre- 
quent reference, the assignment book kept by the 
individual pupil, the distribution of playground 
equipment in regular order, the division of the 
recess time to provide for the free play and drink, 
the spelling study time proportioned so that the 
words may be drilled on in two or three ways — 
such practical problems, if consciously dealt with, 
in an efficient manner, give the pupils an attitude 
toward organization and management which is 
highly desirable, and can readily furnish the basis 
for a schedule of work in all fields of study. 
As the pupil grows older he should learn the 
value of having a definite plan of study, of recall- 
ing what he already knows of a subject before he 
begins to study, of making a synopsis of the sub- 
ject, of the value of varying practice by the use of 
different kinds of imagery — visual, auditory, 
or kinesthetic — or of the importance of physi- 
cal fitness to intellectual achievement.
-P-A-G-E-141
  
STIMULATING HABIT FORMATION 127 
Removing distracting influences. The teacher 
who can secure the maximum of work with the 
minimum of confusion has mastered an essential 
of successful organization. While much of the 
quiet atmosphere of the room depends upon the 
teacher, she has not fulfilled her largest duty to 
the child until she has led him consciously to avoid 
distracting influences. 
Miss N. was a fourth-grade teacher whose pu- 
pils ranked high in deportment, the majority 
ranking one hundred per cent in conduct. Her 
friends were surprised when she was not asked to 
sign her contract for another year. When ap- 
proached in regard to the reason, the superintend- 
ent replied: “It is true that those pupils main- 
tain a solemn silence; there is a stillness which 
is little short of appalling when one enters the 
room. The teacher is not a tyrant; she is ex- 
tremely genteel in all of her relations with her 
pupils. She is, nevertheless, killing the initiative 
and stifling the life activities of her pupils. She 
has a distorted idea of the importance of quiet, 
and sacrifices habits of industry to a mistaken 
idea of good order.” 
The pupil should learn to remove superfluous 
materials from his desk, to have his books ar- 
ranged in the order of ease of accessibility, to ad- 
just a shade which admits direct sunlight on his 
work, to attack work immediately without atten-  
-P-A-G-E-142
    128 PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING APPLIED 
tion to the affairs of his neighbors, to have pencils 
sharpened and other tools ready for work before 
school begins, in order that the study period may 
be devoted, undisturbed, to the essentials planned. 
He should learn to assume these, and other respon- 
sibilities, without being continually reminded by 
the teacher. 
Ability to work individually or in groups. Else- 
where in this discussion we have emphasized re- 
peatedly the importance of pupils acquiring the 
ability to work individually or in groups. Each 
teacher will do well to have her class list various 
study habits which they consider important. By 
frequent reference to these self-imposed stand- 
ards, the pupils become conscious of higher ideals 
and more proficient in their use, providing that 
the teacher has the ability to stimulate a happy 
attitude of self-confidence, and a forward look 
toward an attractive goal. 
EDUCATIONAL PRINCIPLES INVOLVED IN 
THE FOREGOING DISCUSSION 
1. Since the life of the child is to be largely controlled by 
habit, the teacher should guide in the elimination of 
undesirable habits and in the formation of profitable 
ones. 
2. Environment is the determining factor over which the 
teacher may have control; she should, therefore, seek to 
provide helpful influences, that desired habits may be 
consciously fixed in the mind of the pupil as interesting 
goals, 
8, Frequent and regular practice with attention is neces-
-P-A-G-E-143
  STIMULATING HABIT FORMATION 129 
sary to habituate a desired response, and continued ap- 
plication of a habit tends to establish its permanency. 
. The teacher should study the instincts and interests of 
the pupils in order to determine appropriate satisfiers 
and annoyers; the play element may be used to advan- 
tage in making habit formation interesting. 
Every teacher should have a definite program for the 
fixation of certain desirable habits related to the physi- 
cal welfare of pupils; vivid impressions are important in 
fixing a definite goal. 
. The school should take the initiative in habit formation, 
if necessary, and aim to secure helpful codperation 
from the home; since moral training is neglected in 
many homes, the school has an increased responsibility 
in this field. 
Sectarian teaching should be avoided, but definite in- 
struction should be given in desired social attributes. 
Definite reports to parents on social characteristics may 
stimulate a favorable attitude on the part of the child, 
and secure codperation. 
. One of the most fundamental functions of the school is 
10. 
11. to foster correct habits of study. The teacher should 
have definite aims in the teaching of habits of study, 
based upon authentic information, and should make 
definite provision for the realization of these aims. 
Pupils should acquire the habit of selecting specific 
aims, that their work may be meaningful; they should 
learn to organize their information in the light of spe- 
cific purposes, that work may be economical; they should 
form the habit of supplementing the thought of all read- 
ing, in order to secure the richer content of a broader 
view of the subject of study; they should cultivate the 
habit of evaluating materials and opinions, that they 
may select only that which is of real worth, and they 
should form the habit of memorizing those facts which 
are essential on any subject, that they may recall them 
when needed. 
The teacher should foster in the child the habit of using 
knowledge whenever appropriate, that the school work 
may function in the practical life of every day. 
The pupil should be guided in preserving his own in- 
 
-P-A-G-E-144

   dividuality, and in acquiring an attitude of openmind- 
edness toward new ideas. 
12. Since finding and using materials is so important in the 
acquisition of knowledge, the pupil should be taught to 
form definite habits along this line; and should acquire 
specific habits in the making of outlines and schedules 
of work, that study may be definite. 
18. Pupils should learn to remove or avoid distracting in- 
fluences and to concentrate as individuals or as groups 
upon the work in hand, that definite aims may be real- 
ized in every study period. 
PROBLEMS FOR INVESTIGATION AND 
DISCUSSION 
1. Make a list of social and physical habits which you 
would approve for emphasis by a fourth-grade teacher 
in classroom instruction. 
2. Suggest wrong habits of study commonly found in 
Grade 6, and tell how you would correct them. 
8. Why is it necessary to launch any desired habit with 
enthusiasm and interest? 
4. Show how a teacher may stimulate correct social pro- 
cedure without crushing initiative or distracting from 
the train of thought. 
6. Illustrate the importance of correct health habits for 
the growing child. 
6. Suggest ten items in which the teacher’s example may 
influence habit formation.

  CHAPTER IX 
PROVIDING FOR INDIVIDUAL NEEDS 
Tuer teacher who can minister to the individual 
needs of her pupils will be, other things being 
equal, the most successful. What are the individ- 
ual differences which the teacher may expect to 
find in a class in the elementary school? Obvi- 
ously, these differences will vary in kind and 
amount according to age and grade. There are, 
however, certain outstanding general differences 
which the teacher should be able to recognize, in 
the light of which she should plan her procedure. 
Ability to recognize individual differences. The 
teacher may expect her pupils to differ in social 
conditions. In the same group may be children 
from homes of limited advantages, subjected to 
the hindrances of poverty, illiteracy, and degra- 
dation; others from homes of affluence, with the 
influences of culture possible therein; while still 
others come from an environment made up of va- 
rious combinations between these two extremes. 
She may expect her pupils to differ in moral 
conduct, due to differences in training, and as 
manifested in a lack of standards, weakness of 
will power, defiance of authority, and the like. 
Pupils will differ also in their physical efficiency
-P-A-G-E-147
     PROVIDING FOR INDIVIDUAL NEEDS 133 
since they vary in kinds and amounts of nourish- 
ing food consumed, amount and regularity of 
sleep, of wholesome recreation and exercise, and 
of general sanitary conditions with which they 
are surrounded in the home. They will differ in 
the degree of the perfection of the functioning 
of various parts of the body — eyes, ears, nose, 
throat, teeth, heart, lungs, and the like. 
Finally, the teacher may expect her pupils to 
differ in intellectual ability. Even in a school 
where careful attention is given to organization 
and classification, the teacher will still find great 
variation in any class. There will usually be the 
relatively superior, the average, and the slow pu- 
pil, with each of whom the teacher must reckon 
and for whom she must plan. 
In making a careful survey of her class to ascer- 
tain individual differences the teacher needs to 
bear in mind three things. First, she should rec- 
ognize the importance of her position and subse- 
quent responsibility in changing for the better so 
many units of society. No matter from what 
kinds of homes they have been assembled or what 
their previous condition may have been, these pu- 
pils are entitled to equitable opportunities in the 
public schools of a democracy. 
Second, the teacher must keep optimistic. Her 
hope, and the hope of the nation, is in the plas- 
ticity of youth. She should try to keep in touch
-P-A-G-E-148
  184 PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING APPLIED 
with the onward-moving march of progress in ed- 
ucational and world affairs, that she may not be 
discouraged by the narrowness of her seemingly 
endless efforts. 
Third, she must be scientific. She should seek 
to know the best professional opinions based upon 
successful experimentation in each phase of her 
work, and apply this knowledge conscientiously 
whenever feasible. 
The teacher’s duty is only partially done when 
she is able to recognize the individual differences 
in her pupils. Having diagnosed the situation, 
she must select the appropriate course to pursue 
in order to give to every child the fullest oppor- 
tunity for advancement. 
Attention to social needs. In ministering to 
the child’s social needs the teacher should seek 
to make the schoolroom an attractive place in 
which to live. This may be done not only by pro- 
viding suitable decorations with artistic arrange- 
ment, and by attention to sanitary and hygienic 
conditions, but, what is of the utmost importance, 
the teacher should encourage an atmosphere of 
culture. 
Only the genuinely cultured teacher can dis- 
tinguish between an artificial precision of speech, 
a superficial polish of manners, and that innate 
courtesy of the gentlewoman which can make the 
ignorant, awkward, or rebellious boy feel self-
-P-A-G-E-149
  PROVIDING FOR INDIVIDUAL NEEDS 135 
respect and a longing for the better things of 
life. 
A sympathetic teacher with refinement of man- 
ner can make the schoolroom a source of inspira- 
tion to every child, not by repression into awed 
contemplation of the superiority of the teacher; 
rather, by a human interest which is so compel- 
ling that it is contagious, and the class gets the 
spirit. 
There is opportunity in almost every recitation 
for self-expression which demands moral decisions 
and courteous bearing. If the child has not re- 
ceived moral instruction in the home, he should 
not be blamed for his limitations, but helped to 
overcome this handicap in life’s race. A sense of 
fairness in the teacher, who permits no unpleasant 
distinction of manner toward the foreign-born, 
the colored, or the socially unfortunate, will be 
reflected in the atmosphere of the room. 
A chance to acquire breadth of view, an inti- 
mate contact with good music, real] art, and the 
best literature, a sympathetic encouragement in 
practicing the use of correct English, an oppor- 
tunity to become more efficient in the practical af- 
fairs of every day — these are the elements which 
are gradually, but nevertheless potently, elevating 
the standards of the pupils of the public schools, 
and thereby influencing the social status of thou- 
sands of homes.
-P-A-G-E-150
  186 PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING APPLIED 
A first-grade pupil unused to restraint, with no 
established standards, and possibly without mali- 
cious purpose, disturbed the work on a neighbor’s 
desk and appropriated several letter-cards. The 
pupil who was thus imposed upon raised the usual 
complaint, thereby attracting the attention of the 
entire class. 
Here was an opportunity for this teacher, 
who believed that pupils, even in the first grade, 
should learn to respect the rights of others, to ex- 
ercise self-control and to assume moral responsi- 
bility. She bent quietly over the offending pu- 
pil’s desk, and in a low voice which, nevertheless, 
could be heard by every one in the class, asked, 
“What do you think you should do about it, 
Alma?” 
The child, awed by the sudden notoriety, re- 
mained silent. 
“We shall let Alma think about it a while,” 
said the teacher, and passed on to inspect the 
work of other pupils. 
Relieved from the stress of public attention, 
Alma slyly dropped the cards on the desk from 
which she had taken them. When the teacher 
returned for an explanation, she said, “I gave 
them back, Miss K.,”’ to which the teacher re- 
plied, “Now wouldn’t you like to rebuild the 
words which you destroyed on Martha’s desk? 
It doesn’t seem quite right for Martha to work so
-P-A-G-E-151
   PROVIDING FOR INDIVIDUAL NEEDS 137 
hard to have a good lesson, and then have it de- 
stroyed.” 
When Alma’s self-respect had been restored by 
this act of rectitude, the teacher quietly remarked, 
“How much time and trouble it takes to make 
right a mistake! What do you think each child 
should do, class, when he is given work to do?” 
There followed a brief but pointed discussion 
which emphasized the positive elements of good 
behavior while engaged in seat work. Alma’s 
offense was not held in the foreground, since it 
had received sufficient emphasis, but the stand- 
ards of the child and of the class were elevated by 
this one little incident. 
The first-grade teacher who received the dan- 
delion with the stubby stem, as graciously as she 
did the delicate rose with its long stem and green 
leaves, had a fine sense of values. She did, how- 
ever, later have an art lesson on the arrangement 
of flowers in a vase. When the short-stemmed 
dandelion would not stay in the vase, she sug- 
gested that one long-stemmed dandelion with two 
or three green leaves would look well in that par- 
ticular vase. ‘‘Would you like to bring them, 
Bertha?” Thus, little Bertha, with no money to 
buy expensive flowers, and with no home training 
in social manners, went home with the feeling that 
she “belonged” to the room, that the teacher 
cared for her contribution; and she had, inciden-
-P-A-G-E-152
  188 PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING APPLIED 
tally, received instruction in a definite principle 
of art, which could be applied even in her limited 
surroundings. 
Gertrude was a sixth-grade pupil, interested in 
every activity of the classroom, but always handi- 
capped when any research work was to be done at 
home. The teacher recognized her sensitiveness 
and was always careful to see that she had access 
to books at school, so that she would not be em- 
barrassed by a condition over which she had no 
control. 
When the class was studying Egypt and dili- 
gently searching for illustrative materials, Ger- 
trude cut from a newspaper the advertisement of 
a well-known brand of cigarettes and submitted it 
as her offering. The teacher helped her to mount 
it in such a way that it lost its original significance, 
and served the much more worthy purpose of es- 
tablishing a bond of sympathy between teacher 
and pupil and enabled an ambitious child to main- 
tain her self-respect by a definite contribution. 
The above illustrations are but examples of the 
little things in the affairs of each day, but their 
importance in terms of character formation can 
scarcely be overestimated. 
There are many specific plans of a much wider 
scope which will add to the social advantages of 
the school. For example: A geography teacher 
encouraged her pupils to bring copies of any good
-P-A-G-E-153
PROVIDING FOR INDIVIDUAL NEEDS 139 
magazines. The boys of the class made an at- 
tractive rack where the magazines were always on 
display. By this codperative effort the pupils 
had access to good current literature, while at the 
same time a desirable school spirit was stimu- 
lated. 
Attention to physical needs. The physically 
unfit may be benefited by timely attention to 
the correction of defects of eye, ear, nose, throat, 
teeth, nervous or organic troubles, adenoids, 
speech, and the like. The undernourished child 
and the cigarette smoker should have atten- 
tion. 
The teacher is in a position to have a wide in- 
fluence in the enforcement of health laws and in 
the correction of many defects common to child- 
hood. She should codperate cordially with the 
school nurse, or, if no such assistance is provided, 
she should, with the advice of the superintend- 
ent or principal, assume her responsibility in this 
phase of school work. 
She should give special attention to the seating 
of pupils, that those with defective vision or hear- 
ing may be given a favorable opportunity to see 
and hear. She should see that seats and desks are 
properly adjusted to the height of pupils, that de- 
formity due to wrong posture may be prevented. 
The teacher can aid in the general health welfare 
by attention to the prevention of the spread ot in-
-P-A-G-E-154
    140 PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING APPLIED” 
fectious and contagious disease, by emphasis upon 
fresh air and sunshine, and by instituting the 
. milk lunch at rest. 
A school which was limited in funds interested 
the Parent-Teacher Association in a campaign 
for better health. By school entertainments, in 
which children participated and parents codper- 
ated, funds were raised with which to provide 
milk lunch to underweight children. By a sys- 
tematic scheme a few mothers took turns in de- 
voting a day to the weighing of the pupils and 
making a record card for each pupil, so that 
teachers were relieved of this task. 
A physician who was a patron of the school con- 
sented to examine the children for the worst cases 
of anemia. These pupils spent twenty minutes 
each half-day in arest-room. A large room which 
had done service as an indoor playroom was reno- 
vated, cots were secured, blankets and rugs were 
loaned, and a fresh-air clinic was thus established 
with no expense. The improvement in the health 
of the pupils justified the effort. 
Attention to intellectual differences. The 
causes of low mental ability and consequent lack 
of progress may be due to heredity, accident or 
former sickness, bad physical habits, weak power 
of concentration and attention, lack of applica- 
tion, “‘time-killing” attitude, discouragement, 
unruly and stubborn disposition, or indifference
-P-A-G-E-155
PROVIDING FOR INDIVIDUAL NEEDS 141 
due to home influences, lack of a realization of the 
need of education, or laziness. 
Some of these causes cannot be overcome by 
the teacher, but many of them can be remedied by 
careful study and tactful handling. Presenting 
school work in a variety of ways is one way of ap- 
pealing to individual differences. There will be 
pupils in every class who learn most readily by 
means of visual imagery. For these the free use 
of the blackboard is necessary, also an abundant 
use of pictures, stereographs, charts, and other il- 
lustrative materials. 
Detailed oral explanation is necessary for the 
pupil whose auditory imagery is his best avenue 
of approach to new ideas, while a chance for oral 
expression and written work helps to fix the de- 
sired facts in mind. Extensive participation in 
which manipulation, construction, and physical 
activity are features will aid in providing ex- 
pression for various inclinations and tenden- 
cies. 
The teacher can accomplish much, by a closer 
supervision of the study of slow pupils, to discover 
and correct mistakes in their methods of work. 
In planning her work the teacher should provide 
more effective means of arousing interest. That 
which appeals to one may be no stimulus to an- 
other. That which interests the boys may be in- 
adequate to hold the interest of the girls. That
-P-A-G-E-156
142. PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING APPLIED 
which interests to-day may serve its purpose, but 
be entirely inappropriate to-morrow. 
Plenty of handwork in all grades, abundant sup- 
plementary material for the ambitious pupil, and 
interesting suggestions always available, that the 
pupils may not lack avenues of expression, will go 
far toward meeting the individual needs of any 
class. The teacher should not forget that the 
superior pupil deserves as careful study as does 
the slow pupil. It is to these bright pupils that 
leadership will fall in the future; they should not, 
therefore, be left wholly to their own devices to 
find employment suited to their needs. 
Detecting and correcting essential errors. 
Many teachers hesitate to divide their class into 
a strong and a weak class because of the lack of 
inspiration to the slow pupils. This division is, 
perhaps, fairer to the child than to make him com- 
pete with pupils so much his superior as to cause 
discouragement. When the class has been or- 
ganized on the basis of ability to progress at a 
uniform rate, there is still need of personal super- 
vision that a pupil may not acquire wrong habits 
of study or incorrect information and continue to 
clinch such ideas by repetition. 
For example: A pupil continued to get low 
grades in spelling until it was discovered that 
most of her mistakes were due to the addition of a 
superfluous e. When this tendency was pointed 
 
-P-A-G-E-157
     
PROVIDING FOR INDIVIDUAL NEEDS 148 
out and she consciously avoided the habit, her 
spelling difficulties were appreciably lessened. 
A fifth-grade pupil always had difficulty with 
multiplication and consequently with division 
problems, until a careful teacher discovered that 
all of his trouble came from the fact that he had 
never understood the process and arrangement 
when a naught occurred in the multiplicand or 
multiplier. 
Keeping a record of recurring errors and of im- 
provement. The teacher should have a system- 
atic method of keeping a definite record of errors 
to be corrected and of improvement. In the 
third grade the pupil may begin to keep an in- 
dividual record in the various subjects, in which 
he notes recurring errors, and can thus aim toward 
specific improvement. As he grows older he 
should achieve increasing skill in this habit of 
checking his own progress. It is usually a pleas- 
ure and a stimulus to check the list and note the 
items which have been mastered. 
The pupils of a fourth grade were becoming in- 
terested in increasing their vocabulary. Each 
pupil made a “little dictionary,” in which he 
wrote the new words which he acquired from day 
to day. Frequent practice in using these words 
in sentences was encouraged until they became a 
permanent part of the child’s vocabulary. The 
teacher reserved a place on the blackboard, so
-P-A-G-E-158
    144 PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING APPLIED 
that during the progress of any lesson an espe- 
cially interesting word could be written by a pupil 
to be recorded later in each “dictionary.” 
A fifth-grade class kept individual corrected 
records of all misspelled words. At regular inter- 
vals a definite check was made by the teacher 
to see if the pupils were mastering the difficulties. 
When a pupil could spell a word from his special 
list correctly, he marked it plus; if missed again, it 
was marked minus. After the third plus mark was 
secured, the pupil was usually sure of the spelling 
of the word and was permitted to place it in a 
separate record marked “Won Words.” Words 
that were won by such effort became of unusual 
interest, while the entire class improved in their 
attitude toward spelling. 
EDUCATIONAL PRINCIPLES INVOLVED IN 
THE FOREGOING DISCUSSION 
1. The pupils in any room will differ as to social condi- 
tions, physical fitness, and intellectual ability. 
2. The teacher should recognize her responsibility in pro- 
viding for individual differences, but should strive to be 
optimistic, and apply scieritific methods to school pro- 
cedure. 
8. Since the school may be the strongest influence in the 
child’s life, it should be attractive in order to interest 
him, and sufficiently broad in its scope that he may 
there come in contact with a wide variety of beneficial 
influences. 
4. A teacher should be gentle in manner, but enthusiastic 
and vigorous in character, that she may be qualified to

set an example which is stimulating to boys as well as 
to girls. 
. A cultured, sympathetic attitude on the part of the 
teacher is as important as superior scholastic ability. 
. The teacher should by example and by direct instruc- 
tion emphasize correct health habits and the importance 
of hygienic conditions. 
. Much helpful assistance can be secured by an attitude 
of codperation between the school, the home, and the 
community. 
. School work should be presented in a variety of ways in 
order to appeal to the differences in the imagery em- 
ployed by the pupils. 
. The superior as well as the slow pupil should be pro- 
vided for by special study as to individual differences 
and needs. 
Pupils should be encouraged to recognize the recurrence 
of certain errors, and consciously aim for improvement. 
PROBLEMS FOR INVESTIGATION AND 
DISCUSSION 
. What individual differences may a teacher expect to 
find in her pupils? 
. Give an illustration to show that a teacher’s influence 
on an individual pupil may extend into community in- 
fluence. 
. Make a list of physical differences which a teacher may 
expect in a third-grade room; and tell how, and in what 
order, you would take account of them for the purpose 
of improvement. 
. Why should pupils be classified in separate sections 
even in the same grade group? What are the dangers 
and advantages of such classification? 
. What methods may a teacher use in order to keep ac- 
count of each pupil’s difficulties, improvement, and 
achievement? 
. How can you reconcile the democratic ideal of an 
equitable opportunity for all, and the fact that pupils 
differ in ability.

   CHAPTER X 
SUPERVISING THE STUDY PERIOD 
One large feature which confronts the teacher 
to-day is her attitude toward supervised study. 
Like many other innovations, it has loomed so 
large in the past few years that it has become 
somewhat of a fetish, and education has suffered 
the consequences of irrational experimentation 
and premature judgment. Fortunately, how- 
ever, consensus of opinion is beginning to recog- 
nize in these pioneer undertakings the elements 
which are worth while, and those who have helped 
to launch the movement may yet see the fruits of 
their efforts in a reorganized program which gives 
due place to so important a phase of school 
work. ‘ 
Importance in the elementary school. Much 
has been said about supervised study in the high 
school and its importance there should not be 
underestimated, but it is of preéminent impor- 
tance that this phase of education should receive 
consideration in the elementary school. 
By supervised study the pupil is adequately in- 
structed and directed in his methods of studying 
and thinking, that he may know how to prepare 
his work economically and under hygienic condi-  
-P-A-G-E-162
  148 PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING APPLIED 
tions that are favorable to social and intellectual 
advancement. 
It is obvious that during the elementary-school 
period the child is forming habits which will en- 
rich or impoverish his life, both in the present and 
in the future. Since learning how to study is 
more than a mere acquisition of facts, and estab- 
lishing attitudes is the chief function of the school, 
it is time for the teacher in the elementary field to 
see what issues are to be raised and met, and what 
are the possible solutions of the particular diffi- 
culties in this essential element of school work. 
The teacher’s problem. Assuming that teach- 
ers realize the importance of teaching how to 
study, how shall they make a place for it in the 
school program that is already the cause of ex- 
treme anxiety to the conscientious teacher lest 
some important subject be omitted or neglected? 
Shall there be a weekly period devoted to study, 
when difficulties in any and all subjects may be 
discussed with pupils? 
Shall there be a daily period confined to per- 
haps one subject, and rotating in order the sub- 
jects in which the pupils seem to need special at- 
tention? 
Shall there be a divided period in school? If so, 
how often? In what subjects? 
Various plans discussed. While a weekly 
period set aside for conferences concerning diffi-
-P-A-G-E-163
  
SUPERVISING THE STUDY PERIOD 149 
culties is a good opportunity for teacher and pu- 
pils to finish odds and ends of routine affairs 
which may have been pending, or even to con- 
sider important questions in regard to any sub- 
ject, it is not adequate to meet the needs of one of 
the most vital demands of our educational sys- 
tem. 
The laws of habit formation demand that a de- 
sired habit be launched with vigor and enthusi- 
asm, that it should never be allowed to lapse, and 
that it be exercised early and frequently. A 
habit launched with a proper degree of impetus 
might easily suffer many lapses if a week inter- 
vened before it received conscious repetition and 
exercise. 
For the same reason, a daily period devoted to 
first one subject and then to another would have 
little advantage over a weekly period. Such a 
plan might, however, serve to emphasize the 
value of study in the mind of the pupil who has 
not yet learned to realize its importance. It 
might also serve to establish certain habits which 
are common to any study situation; for example 
—control of physical surroundings, preparation 
of necessary tools for work, or planning a definite 
program; but such a disconnected scheme would 
defeat the main purpose of the supervised study 
period. 
Moreover, in each of the above-named schemes
-P-A-G-E-164
  150 PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING APPLIED 
there would be strong temptation for the teacher 
to follow the line of least resistance and spend the 
time on the subject which was of greatest interest 
to her, and which probably needed the least super- 
vision. 
Much difference of opinion exists concerning 
the proper length of the school day, and there are 
strong arguments in favor of each of widely dif- 
fering plans, a discussion of which is not in place 
here. Granted that definite hours are established 
in any system, is it advisable to ask pupils to re- 
main after school for a study period? This has 
been a prevailing practice during past decades, 
and is very often considered a means of punish- 
ment, the victim receiving thereby the disap- 
proval of his classmates. Even if not adminis- 
tered as a corrective measure, there is too often, 
because of tradition, a displeasing ban attached to 
after-school work. 
Besides this attitude, which might be overcome 
under the sympathetic leadership of a tactful 
teacher, there still remains the insurmountable 
objection that both teacher and pupils are too 
fatigued at the close of the school day to secure 
best results in supervised study. Relegating to 
the least opportune time of day this most impor- 
tant phase of school work is obviously unjust. 
The divided period seems to offer more favor- 
able conditions for progress. The so-called reci-   
 
-P-A-G-E-165
i. te | oe TR REE a eee a, See 
SUPERVISING THE STUDY PERIOD 1851 
tation period offers opportunity for building the 
situation, securing interest, raising the problem, 
discussing ways and means for its solution, and 
providing a definite assignment for procedure. 
The pupils are then ready for independent study. 
Most teachers need no urging to call to mind 
the flagrant inability of pupils at this stage in 
school procedure. Unfortunately the conditions 
in most elementary schools are such as to promote 
only the most superficial kind of studying, and 
place emphasis upon the memorization of words 
regardless of understanding, while the avoidance 
of hard intellectual endeavor becomes the result- 
ant of fickle and ill-sustained attention. 
Important elements considered. Since failure 
to guide and direct study is probably the weak 
point in the whole educational régime, it may be 
helpful to list some of the items involved in teach- 
ing how to study that we may know what the task 
is, and then attempt to formulate some principles 
of procedure which will be suggestive of means of 
improvement. 
Since there is such wide difference in intellec- 
tual capacity, no scheme will bring all pupils to 
the same level of proficiency, but the proficiency 
of each student will be increased by teaching him 
to use more skillfully the ability which he has. 
The chief aim of the study period is to teach 
the pupil to work intelligently. In life informa-   
 
-P-A-G-E-166
  152 PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING APPLIED 
tion is gained largely through individual effort. 
We therefore cannot stress too heavily the value 
of correct methods of attacking and disposing of 
problematic situations as they occur. 
We should realize the value of motivation in its 
two phases, that which makes work interesting, 
and that which supplies a moving force for future 
activity. The first may be utilized to secure in- 
terest during the recitation period; the second 
may be the outcome of the study period if right 
methods are employed. 
During the recitation period the class may 
profit by the contributions and discussions which 
are provoked by the stimuli of group activity 
and the approval of others. During the study 
period there should be abundant opportunity for 
individual initiative in following lines of particu- 
lar interest. This work is usually motivated by 
the desire to contribute something worth while to 
the class exercise on the following day; but it may 
be merely pursuing a line of investigation for the 
pleasure of personal information. 
Organization has been discussed from so many 
points of view that the mere mention of the word 
calls up memories of lengthy arguments on the 
psychological versus the logical, or subject-matter 
versus method. With what phases of this vast 
subject are we concerned in the elementary 
school? Each teacher will not need to reach out 
   
-P-A-G-E-167
  
SUPERVISING THE STUDY PERIOD 158 
from her own experience to realize that much of 
the knowledge acquired in the school is of little 
value, because pupils are not able to marshal the 
facts needed into any kind of related sequence; 
while ability to recognize relative values, with 
power to eliminate and select for specific needs, is 
so rare as to be considered almost outside of the 
field of elementary instruction. 
To enable pupils to recognize the need of or- 
ganization, and to acquire ability in organizing, 
are important functions of the study period, while 
all through the work there should come ample op- 
portunity for the use of knowledge which has been 
acquired. 
The use of textbooks, with all that is implied 
thereby, is one large phase of the work of the 
study period. Here, again, the class period may 
arouse interest and set standards, but it remains 
for the supervised study period to see that defi- 
nite habits are established. Use of indexes, sta- 
tistical tables, maps, product charts, glossaries, 
footnotes, and paragraph headings; ability to se- 
lect and reject material in the light of a particu- 
lar need; ability to use with economy of time more 
than one reference book on a particular subject — 
all of these and many other useful habits should 
be begun and raised to a reasonable degree of skill 
in the elementary grades. 
As has already been suggested, a definite prob-
-P-A-G-E-168
154 PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING em 
lem serves as a goal toward which to work and a 
criterion for judging the relative value of material 
and method. 
Suggestions for grouping. Some experiment- 
ers have found it helpful to divide pupils into 
groups — superior, inferior, and average — and 
proportion the work and the supervision accord- 
ingly, spending less time with the more capable 
pupils and devoting more time to those pupils who 
are less able to work independently. While this 
suggestion is helpful, caution should be observed 
in any kind of segregation based upon varying 
degrees of ability lest pupils suffer discourage- 
ment from knowing the basis of such classifica- 
tion. 
A better classification for grouping might be 
the kind of work being done. Often a stronger 
member of the class may offer just the help needed 
to a fellow pupil in the same group, and there is 
a mutual growth gained thereby because of the 
social element involved. 
While pupils are working, the teacher should 
quietly pass from pupil to pupil, or from group 
to group, assisting where the need is most evi- 
dent. Just a word of suggestion may start a 
pupil on the right method, and prevent a waste 
of time and energy. 
Taking account of individual differences. One 
of the chief values of the study period is the op- 
 
-P-A-G-E-169
  SUPERVISING THE STUDY PERIOD 155 
portunity which it affords for the teacher to dis- 
cover individual differences and meet the par- 
ticular needs with specific help. Every teacher 
should realize that differences do exist, and should 
be efficient in diagnosing the case of each pupil 
and alert in suggesting a remedy. 
Whether the pupil has a particular aptitude for 
or aversion to certain subjects; what effect, if any, 
sex has in meeting a particular situation or prob- 
lem; whether the pupil’s imagery needs to be sup- 
plemented; what unique characteristic or pecu- 
liar disposition is possessed by each pupil; what 
relation each bears toward progress; what seems 
to be the mental capacity of each pupil — these 
and other lines of investigation are open to the 
thoughtful teacher who wishes to increase the ef- 
ficiency of her pupils. No phase of school work 
affords better opportunities for such observation 
and the application of the necessary remedial 
measures than does the supervised study period. 
The project method has done much to intro- 
duce the supervised study period into the elemen- 
tary school, and it is this type of work which of- 
fers an ideal situation for learning. There should 
be no rigid line drawn between the so-called reci- 
tation and study periods, but in order to make 
sure that a study period is provided for, the reg- 
ular program must be adjusted to permit the 
teacher to follow the plan which common sense
-P-A-G-E-170
    156 PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING APPLIED 
based upon intelligent theory suggests as the most 
practicable. Whether the first part of the period 
is spent in independent effort on the part of the 
pupils to discover their own problems, and the 
latter part is devoted to group discussions, or vice 
versa, is optional with the teacher. 
Intelligent procedure must depend upon exist- 
ing conditions. A new type of school manage- 
ment must be contemplated, where more freedom 
is permissible. A new type of assignment must be 
introduced, preferably one which the pupils have 
a part in formulating. ; 
The teacher’s standards and attitudes. Before 
supervised study becomes an efficient factor in 
school work, the greatest change, perhaps, must 
come in the teacher’s standards and attitudes. 
She should realize that in an average class a capa- 
ble pupil can do four or five times more work than 
the slowest pupil and twice as much as the aver- 
age pupil. She should remember that ‘‘there is 
no average pupil” in the real sense of the word, 
that every pupil has interests and tendencies 
which are peculiar to himself, and that new ideas 
must come through the avenues of interests al- 
ready formed or possibly being formed by the 
school experience. 
The teacher should know her pupils, and be 
able to connect the suggestions made in class-with 
the actual procedure in handling the assignment. 
 
-P-A-G-E-171
  SUPERVISING THE STUDY PERIOD 157 
She should find out what the pupil is thinking in 
his struggle with the assigned lesson, and guide 
him without giving too much assistance. Ex- 
periments show a waste of time which could often 
be avoided if the teacher would work intimately 
with her pupils. 
The pupil should be led to realize that “‘an eco- 
nomical use of time is the true mode of securing 
leisure.” He should realize that favorable physi- 
cal conditions, spontaneous interest, and concen- 
trated attention must be secured if study is to 
accomplish desired results. 
A special technique of supervising study should 
be developed, showing skill in determining the 
progress being made and skill in stimulating and 
aiding. 
There are certain characteristics which are 
worth special study. The teacher should have a 
sympathetic understanding of the pupil’s view- 
point; a knowledge of children which prepares her 
to meet a variety of attitudes; tact in dealing 
with individuals, based upon a respect for the 
pupil’s confidence and individuality; ability to 
select appropriate subject-matter and adapt 
methods to local conditions; and, finally, leader- 
ship, which involves assurance, interested guid- 
ance, and stimulating enthusiasm. 
When all is said in regard to the latest scientific 
investigation, there still rests with the individual 
 
-P-A-G-E-172
    158 PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING APPLIED 
teacher the responsibility of working out the de- 
tailed procedure which will be most effective for 
her own use, and even then good judgment de- 
mands that there must be a high degree of flexi- 
bility. Perhaps no general motto carries more 
suggestion than the words of Froebel, “Come, let 
us live with our children.” 
The need of supervised study illustrated. 
Failure to realize the complexity of the learning 
process is responsible for a large part of the neg- 
lect of supervised study. A few illustrations, 
taken from just one subject — geography — will 
suggest how great is this neglect. 
What particular mental bonds or associa- 
tions are necessary before a child can locate ona 
map the capital city of his own State? There 
must be hundreds of associations formed for the 
child to know that certain lines mean boundary 
lines, that certain letters mean the name of the 
State, that a certain sized black dot means a city, 
that a capital city is marked by a dot and circle, 
and that the name of a capital city is printed in 
heavier or larger type. 
Or, to take another example: What bonds are 
needed before a child can trace a prospective jour- 
ney on a map, say from Columbus, Ohio, to Buf- 
falo, and have even a small degree of intelligence 
in regard to the country passed? 
There must be specific bonds formed for the
-P-A-G-E-173
  
SUPERVISING THE STUDY PERIOD 159 
particular symbols that represent Columbus and 
Buffalo; for the names or abbreviations of the 
States, Ohio, Penn., N.Y., for the particular sym- 
bol that represents a river. The child must 
know that a particular color and outline repre- 
sents a lake. Specific bonds must be formed for 
understanding the scale of miles, and color key or 
other symbolization that represents elevation of 
land. 
Or, to take a different kind of illustration: 
What specific bonds are needed to understand one 
paragraph, or even one sentence, taken at random 
from any page of a geography textbook? For ex- 
ample: “In spite of its rough area and rugged sur- 
face, New England is a very important part of our 
country.” 
The pupil must have formed hundreds of bonds 
before this one sentence could have any degree of 
meaning, or before he could verify its truth by the 
use of his textbook. He must know the meaning 
of area and something of how relative area is rep- 
resented on the map; he must know surface and 
something of variety in surface before he can ap- 
preciate the meaning of “‘rugged.” He must 
know the meaning of New England, which im- 
plies a knowledge that there are other sections, 
and he must know the meaning of ‘“‘our country” 
in this particular connection in which it is used. 
Simplifying the complexity. In the formation 
 
-P-A-G-E-174
ee ea ee ae ee ae Ope ee ear Ns Ck oa 
160 PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING APPLIED 
of each of these bonds, there are numerous in- 
hibitions of wrong meanings that have to be es- 
tablished. For example, “country” in this case 
must have a specific meaning which is different 
from the usual significance, ‘‘a place where the 
farmer lives”; ‘‘a place where we go in the auto- 
mobile’’; “a place where corn grows and where 
cattle graze.” 
What can be done to simplify this complexity 
and give the child the highest degree of efficiency? 
It is a joint responsibility to be shared by textbook 
writers and teachers. The former must take into 
account the complexity of the associations de- 
manded, and simplify as much as possible the 
facts presented, and the arrangement of those 
facts in the most economical order from the point 
of view of the learning process. 
Much adverse criticism has been directed to- 
ward the authors of geography texts, and some of - 
the modern texts show an improvement; but the 
very nature of the subject is so complex, so broad 
in its scope, that much detail is impossible, and it 
is detail that makes the text more specific and 
easily understood. 
By far the larger responsibility rests with the 
teacher. She must plan her work so that an ap- 
preciative apperceptive basis is being developed, 
and each new problem attacked in the order that 
best fits into the experience of her pupils. It is 
 
-P-A-G-E-175
  SUPERVISING THE STUDY PERIOD -: 161 
only as the teacher recognizes the necessity of re- 
ducing every situation to the formation of spe- 
cific mental bonds made possible only by a definite 
stimulus and its accompanying response that she 
can hope for intelligent progress in her pupils. 
EDUCATIONAL PRINCIPLES INVOLVED IN 
THE FOREGOING DISCUSSION 
1. The pupil’s social and intellectual advancement de- 
pends upon his adequate instruction and direction in 
his methods of studying aud thinking. 
2. The supervised study period is the most economical 
method of assisting the pupil to acquire correct study 
habits and attitudes. 
8. A sensible division of the recitation period into a time 
for study and a time for discussion will enable the 
teacher to work with her pupils and thus stimulate and 
direct their study by careful attention to individual 
differences. 
4, The problematic situation furnishes the best opportu- 
nity for the motivation and organization of work, and 
makes necessary the intelligent study of the proper use 
of textbooks and other reference material. 
&. The grouping of pupils for supervised study may vary 
to suit specific purposes; the important feature to be 
kept in mind is that each child has an opportunity to be 
stimulated to his limit of intellectual endeavor. 
6. The success of supervised study, like any other phase of 
teaching, depends upon the standards and attitudes of 
the teacher. She should be scientific, sympathetic, and 
persistent — she should know her subject, understand 
her pupils, and conscientiously strive for their advance- 
ment. 
 
-P-A-G-E-176
162 PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING APPLIED 
PROBLEMS FOR INVESTIGATION AND 
DISCUSSION 
1. Make a list of the items which you might attempt to im- 
prove in the supervised study period of a class in sixth- 
grade geography. 
2. In what grade do you think the teacher should begin to 
give attention to supervised study? Justify your an- 
swer. 
8. Show how the choice of a problem around which to 
unify the work makes the study period more meaning- 
ful.

CHAPTER. XI 
THE DEVELOPMENT LESSON 
Tuenrz is fallacy in dividing lessons into types, if 
by so doing the teacher becomes confused into 
thinking that any such mechanical division can be 
practiced in the classroom. It is wise, however, 
for the teacher to be conscious of the kinds of pro- 
cedure which will accomplish the desired aim — 
a healthy, happy, growing, thinking, reasoning, 
learning child. 
The essentials of the teacher’s responsibility. 
There are at least two important essentials to the 
teacher’s responsibility in the development les- 
son—a mastery of the subject-matter, and a 
knowledge of the pupils. 
A mastery of the subject-matter implies not 
only a knowledge of the particular facts to be 
taught in any daily lesson, but a comprehensive 
view of the entire subject, with its numerous 
relations to other subjects and interests. 
A knowledge of pupils implies not merely an‘ 
acquaintance that enables the teacher to distin= 
guish her pupils by name; rather, an intimate — 
contact with child nature in general, with the 
interests of the particular group, and with the 
peculiar personalities there represented, that the
-P-A-G-E-178
  164 PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING APPLIED 
development may be specifically related to par- 
ticular needs. 
No one would expect success for the gardener 
who knows only one kind of seeds, and yet, with 
this limited knowledge, attempts to raise a vege- 
table garden. He must not only know the many 
kinds of seeds which are available, but also the 
different varieties in each kind-- He must know 
the best time to plant each kind, and the care 
which is necessary to insure germination and 
growth. He must also know soils and the requi- 
site treatment of each particular kind for the 
growth of the selected crop. He must know the 
kinds of plants which grow well in close proxim- 
ity, just what combinations should be avoided, 
and hundreds of other minute details which are 
the result of extensive training, wide reading, and 
long experience. 
How much more important it is for the teacher, 
who develops ideas, to be fully qualified to meet 
the demands of that vital organism, a child’s 
mind! True, the teacher, as well as the gardener, 
can profit by experimentation, but in the educa- 
tional field the waste is too extravagant, and the 
mistakes too serious, to admit of a general policy of 
experimentation. It isa commendable attitude for 
the teacher to keep openminded to the best sug- 
gestions, gradually adapting in her own field 
those contributions which are of admitted worth.

THE DEVELOPMENT LESSON 165 
By definition, development means the act or 
process of unfolding or bringing to light some- 
thing unknown or unseen before. The develop- 
ment lesson, therefore, may be concerned with 
something entirely new to the child, or it may 
deal with familiar facts in new relations. 
There is another element implied in the use of 
the term “development” — that the process or 
growth is gradual. The word “gradual,” in con- 
nection with the mental processes, is fraught 
with significance. There are no leaps and bounds, 
no “royal roads,” but steady advancement finally 
attains the goal, a complete, related whole, which 
in its turn must be a step in the gradual progress 
toward a more distant goal, or a conclusion of 
wider scope. 
. The development lesson illustrated. A third- 
grade teacher wished to develop a knowledge of 
the improvements which have been made in our 
means of travel. By a series of questions she 
stimulated a discussion of the various means of 
travel with which the pupils were familiar, and the 
relative advantages of each — train, trolley-car, 
steamboat, automobile, and aeroplane. 
As the pupils had recently celebrated Columbus 
Day, the teacher asked: “How do you think 
Columbus came to this country?” As the pupils 
were not sure of the correct answer, she continued: _ 
“We have here some stereographs, one of which
-P-A-G-E-180
  166 PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING APPLIED 
shows the flagship of Columbus, and one a mod- 
ern steamship. We shall look at these views and 
some one may read to us what is told about the 
invention of the steamship.” 
The pictures were then shown, and the stories 
of Robert Fulton and of Columbus were read. 
When asked if they remembered a story which 
told anything which would help them to under- 
stand the progress made in the use of steam, 
a pupil replied: ‘“‘We read about James Watt. 
He found that we could make steam work for 
us.” 
The teacher then started a new line of thought 
by asking: ‘‘What are some of the great differ- 
ences between the ships of Columbus’s time and 
the ships of to-day?” 
Pupils then suggested and discussed size, 
method of “running,” and relative advantages of 
sailing vessels and steamboats, as to time re- 
quired for voyage, construction and furnishings 
for comfort, safety, and the like. 
The teacher’s next question was: “‘When Co- 
lumbus reached this country how did he find the 
Indians traveling?” 
By similar questions and the subsequent dis- 
cussions, which capitalized the fund of informa- 
tion possessed by the pupils, the teacher devel- 
oped a knowledge of the advancement from the 
canoe to the ocean liner, from the stage-coach to
-P-A-G-E-181
  THE DEVELOPMENT LESSON 167 
the automobile and the aeroplane. She skillfully 
stimulated the inquiring attitude, provided pic- 
tures and stories to explain important details, and 
told of a recent centennial exposition in which 
primitive and modern methods of travel were il- 
lustrated by real relics and by floats in a spectac- 
ular parade. 
At the close of the recitation it was evident that 
not only new ideas of historical worth had been 
developed, but familiar facts had acquired new 
meaning by comparison, and a new appreciation 
of relationships and values had been developed. 
The pupils’ intellectual horizon had been broad- 
ened in this one field of knowledge to include a 
realization of the past, an appreciation of the pres- 
ent, and a wholesome attitude of anticipation to- 
ward the future. 
The importance of interest. The teacher can- 
not hope to secure dynamic thinking without sus- 
tained interest. The new ideas must be related 
to familiar facts through the avenue of interest. 
Very often a natural curiosity to know will serve 
to lead the pupil into desired investigations; it 
is, nevertheless, a doubtful procedure to depend 
upon intellectual curiosity to impel every child to 
seek the knowledge which he needs to acquire. 
The teacher, who can relate school work to the 
natural interests of the children, can, through 
those interests, lead them to think clearly, through
-P-A-G-E-182
  168. PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING APPLIED 
the development of new facts which in turn gen- 
erate new interests. 
Amount of new work introduced at one time. 
Pupils are often discouraged by having too many 
new facts imposed at one time. It is not the 
number which confuses so often as it is the order 
in which they are presented. The teacher should 
so plan her questions that a new idea will be un- 
derstood before the recitation advances, or, if the 
progress of thought demands the introduction of 
still other new ideas, a careful summary to relate 
each point to the unified whole is necessary to real 
development. 
The teacher should plan definite illustrations 
which will make clear each difficult step in the 
procedure. To trust to the inspiration of the 
moment to think of an appropriate illustration is 
to neglect an important element in the develop- 
ment lesson. 
Inductive and deductive teaching. The con- 
fusion which is caused in the mind of the teacher 
by trying to decide which to employ, the induc- 
tive or the deductive method, is largely due to a 
lack of analysis of the terms. 
Briefly defined, the inductive method is that 
method which leads the child to arrive at a defi- 
nite rule, principle, or fact, by having him exam- 
ine a sufficient number of individual samples to 
arrive at a general conclusion.
-P-A-G-E-183
  THE DEVELOPMENT LESSON 169 
By the deductive method the pupil is led to 
keep in mind a general truth, principle, or fact, 
and so to analyze a situation that he can recog- 
nize its constituent parts. It will readily be seen, 
then, that the one type of teaching makes use of 
synthetic ability; the other emphasizes the ability 
to analyze. 
Because of the unified, complicated nature of 
the mental processes, the individual shifts from 
one to the other in any complete development of 
thought. Where the teacher usually makes her 
mistake is not in failing to use each method, but 
in a failure to recognize and employ the essential 
elements in each. 
The two methods illustrated. The pupils of a 
third grade were interested in making a school 
bulletin as a gift for their principal. Each pupil 
was to write an account of the various activities 
in which he was most interested. In the written 
composition pupils were encouraged to be accu- 
rate in all forms of punctuation, as their copy 
would be typewritten by older pupils, and they 
wanted it to look like “real print.” 
In the discussion of difficulties, while pupils 
were referring to their Readers to verify correct 
usage as to punctuation, margin, construction, 
spelling, and the like, a bright boy wanted to 
know why you’re was printed with a “comma” in 
it. The teacher replied: “‘Suppose that we have 
a lesson to find out about that.”
-P-A-G-E-184
  170 PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING APPLIED 
For the next English period the teacher had 
written on the board a dialogue showing the con- 
versation between two boys. 
Charles: “Aren’t you going to the picnic, John?” 
John: “No, Carl doesn’t want to go, and I don’t 
want to go alone.” 
C.: “Where’s Jack?” 
J.: “He can’t go; he hurt his foot.” 
C.: “O, come, John! You'll miss the fun!” 
J.: “I’m not going. Hurry, you’re late! You’ve 
only five minutes.” 
C.;: “Won’t you go this afternoon?” 
J.: “No, I mustn’t go. If I don’t finish my work I 
can’t go to-morrow. Once I did what Father didn’t 
like. Wasn’t I sorry? It’s no use talking. I won’t 
go! You shan’t tease me into it!” 
Two boys were selected by the class to read 
the dialogue. 
Teacher: “Who can change the first sentence, but 
still have the same meaning?” 
Several pupils try, but no change in wording 
is secured; only a change in expression. “ 
Teacher: “Who can make the sentence longer at 
this place” (underscores the contraction) “without 
changing the meaning?” 
Teacher: “Who can read the second sentence, mak- 
ing it longer without changing the meaning?”... 
“You may draw a line under the part which has been 
shortened.” .. . “What has been left out in order to 
shorten this expression to doesn’t?” 
Pupil: “The letter o has been left out.” 
Teacher: “Can you tell us in another way?” (No
-P-A-G-E-185
  THE DEVELOPMENT LESSON 171 
response.) “We may say that o has been omitted. 
Let us write that on the board so that we may remem- 
ber it as a new word.” ... “You may find the word 
that has been shortened in the next sentence. We call 
this shortened form a contraction. Let us write it with 
our other new word. Pronounce it, class. Now, who 
will underline the contraction in the next sentence?” 
... “How do you know that it is a contraction?” 
Pupil: “A letter is left out.” 
Teacher: “Can you tell us in a different way?” 
Pupil: “A letter has been omitted.” 
Teacher: “What has been used to take the place of 
the omitted letter?” 
Pupil: “A comma has been used in place of the 
omitted letter.” 
Teacher: “It is not a comma, although it looks just 
like a comma. How does this mark differ from a 
comma?” 
Pupil: “A comma is down low and this mark is up 
high.” 
Teacher: “‘A difference in where it is placed, then, 
tells you that this mark is an apostrophe. That is the 
third new word in this lesson. Can you remember so 
many difficult words?” (Writes apostrophe on the 
board.) .. . “Let us very hastily underline every con- 
traction in this conversation on the board, and tell 
what letters have been omitted.” 
The work proceeded in this way until all of the 
contractions had been noted and understood. 
When a pupil failed to underline the correct word 
or failed to tell the correct omission, he was as- 
sisted by another pupil. 
The teacher wished also to develop the idea that 
contractions are used more in conversation and 
 
-P-A-G-E-186
    172 PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING APPLIED 
poetry than in other forms of writing. The at- 
tention of the class was directed to numerous 
quotations from familiar poems, in all of which 
were contractions. Pupils underlined the con- 
tractions here, also; and told the letter which had 
been omitted. 
To secure a summary of the facts learned, and 
to give practice in wording a definition, the lesson 
continued as follows: 
Teacher: “What is one new fact which you have 
learned this afternoon?” 
Pupil: “We have learned that a contraction is where 
a letter is left out.” 
Teacher: “You have the idea, I think, but you do 
not word it well. Who else will try?” 
Pupil: “A contraction is a word that has been short- 
ened by omitting some letters.” 
Teacher: “That is almost like a real definition from 
abook. Ihave here some books with definitions. Let 
us have them read, and see if our definition is just as 
good.” (Pupil is selected by the class to read.) 
Teacher: “What else have we learned to-day that 
will help us in our writing?” 
Pupil: “An apostrophe is a mark used in a contrac- 
tion to take the place of omitted letters.” (The 
pupils again verified their definition by looking in the 
language books.) 
As a final impression the teacher asked each 
pupil to read his own composition, written in the 
previous lesson period, to see if he had used any 
contractions. When the apostrophe, used to 
show possession, was noticed, there was a real
-P-A-G-E-187
  THE DEVELOPMENT LESSON 173 
reason for another development lesson, which the 
teacher promised for the next day. 
In the lesson here described, the pupil’s atten- 
tion was called to the contraction in so many dif- 
ferent forms that he was able, from these specific 
illustrations, to arrive at a definition of a con- 
traction and of the use of the apostrophe. This 
procedure was largely inductive, but, early in the 
lesson, the pupils began to be more certain of the 
principle and began to apply it in each new illus- 
tration. This application of a general principle 
to specific cases was deductive. Later, when the 
new principle was defined, and the pupils were 
consciously verifying it and looking for illustra- 
tions to see if contractions were most often used 
in conversation and poetry, the process was al- 
most entirely deductive. 
Essential elements emphasized. The essen- 
tial elements in this procedure were — first, ap- 
proaching new knowledge through a felt need, a 
natural interest in the pupil’s life; second, fur- 
nishing sufficient illustrations of the new prin- 
ciple that the pupils could see the relation without 
having to be told; third, having a variety of con- 
tractions, that the pupil should not form the 
erroneous conclusion that only a certain letter 
could be thus omitted; and fourth, emphasizing 
the new idea through a variety of ways, seeing, 
underlining, explaining, defining, and verifying.  
-P-A-G-E-188
174 PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING APPLIED 
    Mistakes in prevalent practice. The mistake 
often made in a lesson of this kind is to start the 
work with a definition from a textbook, and ex- 
pect the child to remember and apply a difficult 
principle by the examination of a few illustra- 
tions. The plan lacks interest and it does not 
conform to the laws of habit formation by making 
use of frequency, vividness, and repetition to fix 
the new idea in the memory; nor does it give op- 
portunity for the practice of inductive reasoning 
which is needed in so many of life’s problems. 
The teacher frequently resorts to the textbook 
routine as a time-saver, but the waste in the pu- 
pil’s interest and effort is too great to excuse any 
such attempt to replace vigorous, original think- 
ing. 
EDUCATIONAL PRINCIPLES INVOLVED IN 
THE FOREGOING DISCUSSION 
1. If the child is to advance in the ability to think clearly 
and arrive at correct conclusions, he needs careful guid- 
ance by a teacher who has a mastery of subject-matter 
and a thorough knowledge of the pupil. 
2. The development lesson implies that the child is to be 
gradually led to see new truths, or to be conscious of 
new relations. 
8. Interest is essential if pupils are to make significant 
advancement in the development of new ideas. 
4, The inductive lesson demands preparation which 
arouses interest, carefully selected illustrations which 
point toward a definite conclusion, abundant oppor- 
tunity for comparison, a generalization from these il- 
lustrations, and specific application of the newly dis- 
covered principle.
-P-A-G-E-189
  THE DEVELOPMENT LESSON 175 
5. The deductive method of teaching demands a knowl- 
edge of a generalized truth, an analysis to select in- 
dividual elements, a suggested hypothesis of procedure, 
and a verification in the light of the general principle. 
6. Almost every life situation calls for the two methods; 
therefore, neither should be neglected in school pro- 
cedure. 
7. The teacher’s responsibility is in determining the es- 
sential elements necessary for the development of new 
ideas and dynamic thinking on the part of the pupils. 
PROBLEMS FOR INVESTIGATION AND 
DISCUSSION 
1. Outline the subject-matter which a teacher should 
know in order to guide the pupils in the solution of the 
problem: What products of South America make her 
essential to other parts of the world? 
2. Give an illustration from your own experience in which 
you did inductive and deductive reasoning. 
8. Examine and list the names of three textbooks for 
children which have provided for the approach to new 
work by use of the inductive method. 
4, Outline a lesson plan in which your main purpose is the 
development of new knowledge. 
5. Why is it a dangerous practice to start difficult pro- 
cedure with a definition? 
6. Why is it essential that the teacher should know in- 
timately the experiences and interests of her pupils?

THE REVIEW LESSON 
Tue review lesson may have various objectives 
determined by the purpose of the teacher. 
The review as an element in habit formation. 
The review may be a step in habit formation, 
wherein the main purpose is to drill on facts al- 
ready known in order to further impress them 
upon the mind of the pupil that he may recall 
them when needed. 
The pupil may understand that nine times six 
are fifty-four, and also all of the other combina- 
tions in the multiplication of nine, but it requires 
frequent review in a variety of situations to en- 
able him to know these facts sufficiently well that 
he may isolate them from all other facts, and re- 
call them when needed. 
He may know that a plural subject demands a 
plural predicate, but it requires recent and fre- 
quent impressions to make this fact a familiar 
principle which becomes practice in his daily 
speech. 
The review asasummary. The review may be 
a summary of all the known facts concerning a 
given subject, in which the pupil is given an op- 
portunity to unify his thinking into an orderly

whole, before advancing to the mastery of more 
difficult knowledge which is dependent upon such 
a review for its interpretation and assimilation. 
A sixth-grade teacher wished her pupils to have 
a practical knowledge of adjective pronouns. As 
a basis for this new classification they must re- 
view their knowledge of the limiting adjective 
and the pronoun. 
The following sentences were placed on the 
blackboard, with the assignment to list the ad- 
jectives and pronouns contained therein: 
. Those apples are for you and me. 
. [like this book. 
. John bought these pencils for us. 
. Did you see that picture? 
. Did many people come? 
. Few persons were there. 
. Much work was done. 2D

When the recitation time came, the preparation 
was verified. 
Teacher: “How many adjectives did you find, 
Harry?” 
Harry: “I found seven adjectives — those, this, 
these, that, many, few, and much.” 
When some of the pupils differed, Harry re- 
called the definition of the limiting adjective, and 
gave other illustrations, until the class had reas- 
sembled the required knowledge of the limiting 
adjective. When there seemed to be no more 
doubt in regard to this part of the assignment,

Gretchen was asked to name the personal pro- 
nouns, and responded as follows: “‘you, me, I, us, 
you.” 
The class then gave illustrations to show that 
they understood the use of the personal pronoun. 
When the teacher felt that sufficient knowledge 
had been recalled to permit vigorous thinking, 
she asked: 
“Who can arrange the first sentence in order to 
leave out one word and still retain the present mean- 
ing?” 
Marguerite: “Those are for you and me.” 
‘Teacher: “What was those in the first sentence?” 
Marguerite: “It was an adjective.” 
Teacher: “Is it the same now?” 
Marguerite: “‘ Yes, Miss H., I think it is.” 
Barker: “I do not. It stands for apples now. I 
think it is a pronoun.” 
Teacher: “Is its use anything like it was in the 
original sentence?” 
Howard: “I think I see. It stands for both. It is 
a pronoun because it stands for apples, and it is an ad- 
jective because it points out apples.” 
Teacher: “How will the second sentence read when 
rearranged?” 
The same procedure was followed until the pu- 
pils were quite familiar with the double service 
performed by each of the selected words. They 
were then guided in the formation of a definition 
for the adjective-pronoun. 
Without the review which introduced the fa- 
miliar use of the adjective and the pronoun, it is

THE REVIEW LESSON 179 
doubtful if the pupils could have done such care- 
ful thinking and the necessary analysis to arrive at 
a meaningful definition. 
The review for the recognition of new rela- 
tions. The review may at times be a new view of 
familiar facts, in which the pupil is led to see new 
relations hitherto not appreciated, because of a 
lack of the necessary background of information. 
A fifth-grade class had become interested in 
Mexico by seeing a motion picture which was not 
of a particularly educative type. The school 
community had a large foreign element, and the 
teacher wished to create and foster a tolerant and 
an appreciative attitude toward the foreigner. 
With the interesting film as a background she 
encouraged a discussion of Mexico until a pupil 
raised the question: Why are there so few large 
cities in Mexico? Here was the basis for con- 
tinued study. Pupils sought information from 
all available sources until they had acquired a 
very creditable knowledge of Mexico. 
During the progress of the work a parent be- 
came interested, and, encouraged by the teacher, 
requested the pupils to prepare a program on 
Mexico to be given at a meeting of the Parent- 
Teacher Association. 
The pupils must of necessity review their 
knowledge of Mexico in the light of this new pur- 
pose. They decided to have a fair or bazaar, in 
 
-P-A-G-E-194
180 PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING APPLIED 
    which they would display the products and show 
the customs of Mexico. With renewed interest 
they sought information from other sources, and 
reorganized their previous knowledge for use in 
this new project. 
Various pupils agreed to be responsible for dif- 
ferent topics, that the audience might be told the 
most important and most interesting facts con- 
cerning Mexico. Stereographs and lantern slides 
were used to add interest; each pupil talking be- 
fore the class in order to get suggestions before he 
should appear at the fair. 
In this manner the entire class reviewed their 
work on Mexico, added to their fund of informa- 
tion, and comprehended relations which otherwise 
would have been neglected. 
The review as a test of teaching. The review 
furnishes a means to the conscientious teacher of 
checking the results of her teaching. If the pu- 
pils fail to master the subject-matter; if they fail 
to know the essential facts in history; if they fail 
to reason accurately in solving the required prob- 
lem; if they do not spell the word correctly, or 
write the letter legibly; if they cannot describe 
the geographical situation, or give the results of 
the experiment in nature study — the teacher 
may well conclude that she has employed the 
wrong method. She should analyze her procedure 
to see in what she may improve in order to in-
-P-A-G-E-195
  THE REVIEW LESSON 181 
sure correct study habits for her pupils and de- 
sired results in her teaching. 
Appropriate time for review. The review may 
appropriately come at any time when a unit of 
work has been completed or when new work is to 
be approached. It may be used effectively for a 
few minutes at the beginning of any lesson to en- 
able the pupils to recall pertinent facts as an ap- 
proach to new ideas. The teacher often neglects 
this principle of building the new structure upon 
the firm foundation of familiar facts, thereby 
causing confusion in the mind of the pupil and 
consequent delay in the learning process. 
Because of the continuous nature of subject- 
matter and the necessary classroom organization, 
there must be somewhat arbitrary divisions in the 
work to be attacked. The review period is a 
means toward the unifying of this seemingly dis- 
connected procedure. 
A few minutes at the close of the recitation to 
permit the pupils to summarize the important 
elements will go far toward establishing a se- 
quence in what to the pupil often seems an ap- 
parently unrelated mass of material. 
The special review period. There are stages 
in school procedure when it is highly desirable to 
plan an entire recitation with review as the main 
purpose. Such a lesson enables both teacher and 
pupils to detect and correct mistaken ideas and
-P-A-G-E-196
  182 PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING APPLIED ~ 
incorrect methods of work. It also increases the 
confidence of the pupils in their ability to recall 
and use knowledge. 
One fourth-grade teacher encourages pupils to 
keep a list of questions on each day’s geography 
lesson, and, on a day when the unit of work is fin- 
ished, each pupil may ask the class the question 
which to him seems of most importance. In this 
way the pupil has an incentive to study; he learns 
to discriminate between the fundamental and the 
trivial; and he has an opportunity to review an 
entire unit of work without the impediment of 
monotony. 
Such a scheme needs careful guidance by the 
teacher in order that all pupils may have an op- 
portunity for participation, and that no item of 
importance is neglected in the review. 
Importance of an interested attitude. Perhaps 
no phase of school work is so wasteful because of 
a lack of interest as the review lesson. This is 
largely due to the feeling on the part of the pupils 
that “the same old thing” will be gone over; and 
this, of course, is due to the mistaken idea of the 
teacher who fails to plan specifically for this phase 
of the work. 
The teacher who depends entirely upon the list 
of questions in the textbook as her only source of 
inspiration is losing an opportunity to make vital

oped to suit the needs of the particular situation. 
Textbook questions are only suggestive, and can- 
not bear the same intimate relation to the lives of 
the thousands of different pupils, under as many 
different kinds of environment, for whom they 
have been prepared. 
It is the teacher’s function to supply to the 
review lesson that interpretative element which 
makes the subject-matter meaningful to each par- 
ticular child. 
A fifth-grade teacher held frequent written re- 
views in which she carefully planned the questions, 
and the pupils exchanged papers for discussion. 
Emphasis was placed, not upon the grading of the 
paper, but upon a constructive criticism of the 
opinions therein expressed. Animated discussions 
arose over differences of opinion. The teacher 
was the guiding force to encourage openminded- 
ness and the necessary verification of points under 
discussion. : 
In this procedure the spontaneous interest of 
the pupils was secured, and they were stimulated 
to careful preparation, thoughtful evaluation, and 
courteous discussion. 
Another teacher frequently employs a “‘ques- 
tion box”? as a device to maintain interest. The 
pupil drops into the box a question which he is 
able to answer, and which he thinks will be inter- 
esting and profitable to review. «
-P-A-G-E-198
184 PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING APPLIED 
Before the recitation a committee of two pupils 
opens the box and numbers the questions in the 
order which they consider to be a good sequence. 
At the recitation period the pupils “draw” the 
questions, study for five minutes, and then recite. 
The pupils who have acted as inspectors have 
charge of the recitation, calling on the pupil who 
wrote the question as a final judge of the answer. 
In case of a lack of agreement the question is filed 
for further study, and is discussed at another class 
period. 
Occasionally the “question box” is open to 
questions in any subject for the purpose of relat- 
ing the various subjects, and giving needed op- 
portunity for discrimination in the questions 
asked. ‘ 
Such devices are of value in appealing to the 
child’s interest in the unusual, but they should 
never be used as an end in themselves. The 
teacher should always endeavor to keep the main 
purpose in the mind of the pupils, and gradually 
build up an interest in the various subjects by re- 
lating them to the life activities. 
Mistaken emphasis upon examinations. Many 
teachers fail to plan any definite review, but 
give periodic examinations, in which they rigidly 
test the acquisition of knowledge of their pupils 
in a required division of work. 
Such a system of examining may have a certain 
 
-P-A-G-E-199
  THE REVIEW LESSON 185 
value in forcing the indolent pupil to assume a 
definite responsibility through the fear of failure, 
but it violates recognized laws of learning to such 
an extent that a progressive teacher should use it 
with caution. 
The teacher must of necessity ascertain the 
strength and weakness of her pupils before she 
can help them to further progress, but subjecting 
them to the nerve-racking experience of a week of 
formal examinations, planned to include special 
difficulties, creates an attitude of fear and distaste 
which should be avoided. 
The teacher should early determine the main 
purpose of the examination and seek to interest 
the pupil in a desire to test himself; thus making 
the examination a desirable experience, instead of 
a dreaded issue which he is forced to meet. The 
examination should be no more difficult than a 
written lesson, and should come at irregular inter- 
vals when needed to clarify ideas for the pupil, or 
to enable the teacher to check her methods of 
teaching. 
Value of standard tests. The various standard 
tests which have been devised have met a very 
definite need in the educational field. By exten- 
sive experimentation and statistical treatment of 
results the authors of these tests in the various 
school subjects have established norms by which 
it is possible to measure the achievement of any
-P-A-G-E-200
    186 PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING APPLIED 
class or individual, and thereby ascertain his rela- 
tive position in comparison with others of the 
same age or grade. 
No teacher can afford to neglect the opportu- 
nity to become familiar with the progress which 
has been made in this field of work, and apply 
that which is appropriate in her own class- 
room. 
The standard test replaces the formal examina- 
tion period with a series of questions which are 
interesting. The results obtained enable the 
teacher and pupils to ascertain the points in which 
help is needed. The pupil should always be en- 
couraged to compete with his own best effort, as 
well as to attempt to raise the class record. The 
results of the tests can be graphically portrayed in 
a way which encourages comparison and stimu- 
lates interest in improvement. 
An adequate discussion of tests and measure- 
ments would require a more detailed description 
than is permissible in this volume. The teacher 
should bear in mind, however, that every meas- 
urement represents a highly partial and abstract 
treatment of the product, and should be accred- 
ited as such in school procedure. She should also 
recognize that there are two kinds of measure- 
ments: First, how well a pupil performs a uniform 
task; and second, how difficult a task a pupil can 
perform. The chief use of measurements is to
-P-A-G-E-201
  THE REVIEW LESSON 187 
give the pupil information about his own achieve- 
ment and improvement. 
There are now reliable tests and scales in read- 
ing, spelling, penmanship, language, and arithme- 
tic. The complexity of the various functions in 
geography is so great that a measurement of abil- 
ity or of improvement in any one function, or in 
the function as a whole, is attended by great diffi- 
culty. 
Not many attempts along this line have been 
made, and those which have been published are 
far from any degree of accuracy. Meager as is 
the scientific proof in this subject, much influence 
has been brought to bear, by those investigations 
which have been made, on the selection of mini- 
mal essentials and on methods of teaching. Per- 
haps the greatest result achieved is in centering 
the attention of educators upon the subject of geo- 
graphy and upon the importance of its investiga- 
tion by scientific tests and measurements. 
In the earlier days an ambitious author could 
win attention to his efforts by such a title as 
“1000 Questions in Geography with Correct An- 
swers ”’; and such a book was hailed by prospec- 
tive candidates for diplomas as a boon to help 
“cram” for the expected examination. The over- 
worked teacher often gave it a place in her own 
scheme of study, with the hope that the much- 
coveted certificate might be gained with greater 
ease.
-P-A-G-E-202
  188 PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING APPLIED 
One needs but glance through the pages of such 
a book of, say, ten or fifteen years ago, to see how 
the demands in this subject have changed. These 
changing conditions make it difficult, but never- 
theless important, that the teacher consider the 
following questions: 
1. What are the fundamental principles in geogra- 
phy that every one should know? 
2. What facts are of such universal significance that 
they should be memorized? 
3. What are the variables that should be considered? 
Many important investigations have been 
made in this field with which every progressive 
teacher should be familiar, that she may be con- 
scious of the essentials to be emphasized with her 
pupils. 
The question as a factor in review. Since the 
question is of such great importance in the review 
lesson it should receive due attention in the teach- 
er’s plan. The purpose of the question is to call 
forth a response — the statement of a fact, de- 
pendent upon mere rote memory, or the state- 
ment of a judgment arrived at through the intri- 
cate complexity of selection, comparison, analysis, 
evaluation, and rejection or acceptance, involved 
in the reasoning process. 
The question which arouses the response of ap- 
preciation calls for careful consideration on the 
part of the teacher, as does also the question
-P-A-G-E-203
  THE REVIEW LESSON 189 
which puts the pupil in an inquiring attitude, and 
whose response is further questioning. 
In a previous chapter we have discussed the ele- 
ments of good questioning. In addition to the 
principles there stated the teacher should know 
that for purposes of review the good question is 
the one which calls forth the ready response in a 
manner which observes the demands of economy, 
She should preserve a logical sequence between 
questions, and strive to ask those questions which 
make a universal appeal to the largest number in 
the class. She should observe individual differ- 
ences and distribute her questions in order to se- 
cure the maximum mental activity of every mem- 
ber of the class. 
EDUCATIONAL PRINCIPLES INVOLVED IN 
THE FOREGOING DISCUSSION 
1, The review lesson may have, as objectives — drill on 
facts already known, a summary as a means of unifying 
the knowledge of pupils, appreciation of new relations 
through a new view of familiar facts, and from the 
teacher’s viewpoint it may be a test of her teaching 
ability. 
2. The review may appropriately come at the beginning or 
close of every lesson for the purposes of approach and 
summary; it may also occupy a special period for the 
purpose of locating and correcting important errors and 
omissions in the pupil’s stock of ideas and study habits. 
8. The teacher should plan specifically for the review les- 
son in order to secure and hold the interest of the 
pupils, that vigorous thinking may be encouraged. 
4. Devices may be used to awaken interest, but should 
never become an end in themselves.
-P-A-G-E-204

. The examination has a definite function in the educa- 
tional experience, but should be conducted in such a 
manner that pupils consider it an aid to learning. 
. The standard test is a valuable aid in the diagnosis of 
pupil achievement. These tests should be studied with 
care, used with discretion, and their results should be 
made the basis of intelligent improvement. 
. The teacher’s questions are of special significance in the 
review lesson; they should not be left to the chance 
inspiration of the moment, but should be carefully 
planned to follow a definite sequence. 
PROBLEMS FOR INVESTIGATION AND 
DISCUSSION 
. Describe a review lesson where habit formation was the 
prime objective. 
. Give illustrations from three different subjects in which 
the review lesson took the form of a summary. 
. To what extent should the review lesson deal with new 
facts? 
. What are the advantages and weaknesses of formal ex- 
aminations? 
. List as many reliable standard tests and scales as you 
can, for each of the school subjects.

CHAPTER XIII 
THE DRILL LESSON 
In the days of “the little red schoolhouse,” drill 
formed a large part of the class exercise. While 
there was something to be commended in these 
early methods, there was much that time has 
proved to be of little worth. In an attempt to 
discard antiquated methods there is a strong tend- 
ency to ignore the fundamental laws of habit for- 
mation, which apply in the intellectual realm just 
as pertinently as in the physical phases of human 
endeavor. 
The function of drill. Wrong methods of con- 
ducting drill exercises have been due to wrong 
conceptions as to the function of drill. With the 
thousands of impressions which daily demand 
recognition, it is inevitable that only a portion of 
this vast array should be retained as permanent 
possessions of the mind. 
The drill period should be devoted to emphasiz- 
ing those facts or habits which thoughtful study 
of experience has proved to be a necessity in the 
child’s life. The great danger which confronts 
the teacher is in not being able to select with dis- 
crimination the essential elements in each subject 
which need drill. Drill is not needed on all points ~ 
 
-P-A-G-E-206
192 PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING APPLIED 
alike. Practice should be upon “the danger 
points,”’ the troublesome places. 
A second danger, and one fraught with more 
disastrous results, is the fault shared by educators 
in general — textbook-makers, school adminis- 
trators, and teachers + that of attempting to im- 
pose upon the child the information which he will 
need in later life regardless of his interests at the 
present time.” This mistake has developed from 
the best of intentions, and is all the more insidious - 
because it rests upon a psychological truth, that 
the mind of the child is plastic and therefore mem- 
orizing is facilitated during the early years. 
The plasticity of the pupil’s mind should be 
turned to better account than memorizing State 
boundaries, the number of soldiers engaged in the 
battle of Saratoga, or the year that Eli Whitney 
invented the cotton-gin. These facts are at times 
of some importance, and pupils should at least be 
so familiar with their significance that they can 
be located readily if needed. They should be 
memorized in connection with facts which are rel- 
atively more important if the child is to get a clear 
perspective in his fund of information. It is of 
far greater value for the pupil to know the rela- 
tions existing between States, to understand the 
significance of the battle of Saratoga, or to realize 
the effect upon industry of the invention of the. 
cotton-gin.
-P-A-G-E-207
   THE DRILL LESSON 193 
Thoughtful educators are gradually analyzing 
the needs of adult life to ascertain minimal essen- 
tials, while at the same time experimentation is 
revealing possibilities in pupil interests which 
have hitherto been excluded from the classroom. 
There still remains, notwithstanding, the inevi- 
table fact that the human body and intellect are so 
constituted as to require drill in order to establish 
habits. The teacher should be able to see its rela- 
tive importance and assign to it the proper pro- 
portion of time and attention in the school régime. 
The child in the fourth grade would better have 
frequent practice in multiplying a three-digit num- 
ber by a two-digit number than to spend his time 
on the multiplication of eight-digit numbers by 
six-digit numbers, for which operations he has lit- 
tle comprehension and less use. 
Arousing strong motives. Since drill is essen- 
tial, the teacher must face the responsibility of de-_ 
ciding what are the important elements of that 
drill which is worth while in habit formation. 
The first essential in the drill period is for the - 
‘pupil to be conscious of a real need. This realiza- 
tion of a need implies a consciousness of aim. 
When drill is most effective it comes at the sugges- 
tion of the pupil, himself, when he views it as a 
necessary performance to secure a desired result. 
) The teacher’s function is to surround the pupils 
‘with stimulating situations that they may see the
-P-A-G-E-208
  194 PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING APPLIED 
need of drill to complete their scheme of work. 
When the pupil is led to a realization of his need 
for drill the situation is ready for quick and effec- 
tive action. 
The first-grade pupil who cannot count the pu- 
pils present to see how many paste papers are 
needed, the second-grade pupil who cannot count 
by fives to see how many Red Cross seals are to be 
distributed, the third-grade child whose story can- 
not be posted on the Bulletin Board because of 
poor penmanship, the sixth-grade pupil who can- 
not participate in the lantern talks because he re- 
members no facts about Japan, are but illustra- 
tions of daily opportunities for the teacher to 
impress upon the child the importance of drill. 
The drill period which is closely related to an 
immediate situation in the child’s life, holds his 
interest and consequently has the advantage of 
concentrated attention and favorable attitude. 
The adequate motive, then, is the real motive de- 
veloped by making the drill grow out of, and meet 
the needs of the work being done, and by applying 
the results of the drill immediately. There are 
many varieties, but the highest rank should be 
given to the motive which is onward-reaching in 
its tendency. 
Ideally every drill lesson should start with con- 
crete work to show the need of the drill, and 
should close with concrete work to afford oppor-
-P-A-G-E-209
THE DRILL LESSON 195 
tunity to use and test the habits formed. Be- 
cause of the present organization of classes this 
ideal cannot always be attained in each recitation. 
It is advisable, therefore, for the teacher to so re- 
late a series of lessons that the pupils are conscious 
of the concrete application. 
No teacher need hope for the best results who 
does not provide for abundant use of knowledge in 
concrete situations. To the extent that knowl- 
edge is related to life will it be assimilated and 
made ready for use through drill. The teacher 
should be resourceful in methods and devices, 
persistent and patient in developing the desired 
attainment, but not satisfied until the aim is 
achieved and the required skill is mastered. 
There are many pupils to whom intellectual ef- 
fort is distasteful unless it is introduced in the 
light of an immediate interest. For such pupils 
the teacher may use artificial motives, such as 
games, grades, or the approval of the teacher. 
There should always be maintained, nevertheless, 
the close relation between the drill and the appli- 
cation to real situations. 
Motivation illustrated. A first-grade teacher, 
whose pupils had difficulty with certain words, 
hastily sketched the shape of a fish around each 
word on the blackboard. A pointer was given to 
each of two pupils to see who could “catch the 
most fish.” Asa pupil said a word, the first pupil  
-P-A-G-E-210
196 PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING APPLIED 
to point correctly “caught the fish.” At another 
time the words were autumn leaves which the 
wind (an eraser) blew away; at another time they 
were “bricks in a wall” which each day grew 
higher as more “bricks”’ were laid. 
The older pupils of the fifth and sixth grades 
will be interested in such games as “The Tourist.” 
A child stands in front of the class, or in the center 
of a circle which the class forms around him. He 
names the city in which he has been visiting and 
calls on some child to fill the blanks. Thus: “I 
visited New York to-day. I saw there, automo- 
biles from ...... ;cotton from ...... ; flour from 
Stee ;and shoes from ......;” or, “I visited 
San Francisco to-day. I saw them manufacturing 
SEB ; shipping ......; and importing ......” 
There are many such games which are of great 
value in drill if the teacher is resourceful in select- 
ing them at an appropriate time, and has the ex- 
ecutive ability to make them succeed. 
Providing for repetition. Teachers have al- 
ways emphasized repetition in drill work, but the 
prevalent practice would indicate that the prime 
objectives in this phase of drill have not been rec- 
ognized. There are three essential elements to be 
considered if repetition is to be a real contributory 
factor in habit formation. 
First, attention must be secured and kept 
through various means, the exact nature of which
-P-A-G-E-211
THE DRILL LESSON 197 
each teacher must determine by the needs and in- 
terests of her particular class. She must even be 
conscious of the individual needs and interests 
and plan therefor in a specific way. 
1. One means of securing and maintaining atten- 
tion is to vary the procedure by having oral and 
written work, printed or mimeographed sheets, or 
cards containing the facts needed in the drill, and 
frequent, well-planned use of the blackboard. 
A first-grade teacher, who wished her pupils to 
acquire the habit of silent reading, printed sen- 
tence flash cards, using words which had been ac- 
quired in the reading vocabulary and which were 
not too difficult for the pupils. As the teacher 
showed the card, the pupil responded with the 
correct word or action. The sentences were so 
arranged as to call for five different kinds of re- 
sponse. For example: For the story of ‘The Lit- 
tle Red Hen” and “The Gingerbread Boy” the 
sentences requiring action were such as: Point to 
the man. Runtome. Run tothe boy. Those re- 
quiring pretended action were: Cut the wheat. 
Grind the wheat. Plant a seed. Questions to be an- 
swered by “Yes” or “No”: Can a woman make 
bread? Can you eat bread? Did the woman want a 
cat? Questions to be answered by “Right” or 
“Wrong’”’: The Red Hen said, “Not I.” The Gin- 
gerbread Boy can run. Bread is made of wheat. 
Sentences requiring a blackboard response were: 
 
-P-A-G-E-212
198 PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING APPLIED 
  Draw a gingerbread boy. Draw some wheat. 
Draw a hen. 
When a pupil failed to respond, the teacher fre- 
quently turned to the board and wrote other 
words or sentences to give the child a clearer inter- 
pretation. The pleasure of participation was in- 
creased when the card was given to the child to 
hold whenever he made a correct response. Spe- 
cial commendation was the reward of the child 
who held the most cards at the close of the reci- 
tation. 
The procedure in such a recitation may be va- 
ried in various ways to secure greater drill. For 
example, the pupil may read the sentence orally 
as he places his card on the blackboard ledge in 
the front of the class, or he may hold up a card 
and call on another pupil to read. 
2. A second means of securing and keeping at- 
tention is to set_a time limit for the performance of 
a given task. With watch in hand the teacher 
may build the situation by merely saying: “‘See if 
you can solve the five problems in five minutes”; 
or, “You will have three minutes to write the 
missing numbers”; or, “I solved those problems 
in ten minutes; see how long it will take you to 
solve them.” 
8. A third means of gaining and holding atten- 
tion is to appeal-tothe instinct of emulation. The 
child may often be stimulated to compete with
-P-A-G-E-213
  THE DRILL LESSON 199 
himself by such questions as: “What was your 
record yesterday? Can you raise your grade to- 
day?” He may be encouraged to compete with 
another individual in the class or to codperate with 
a team to win in a race for points. 
In all such competition there are moral and so- 
cial problems that need guidance and are as essen- 
tial as the drill itself. To be codperative, courte- 
ous, honest, cheerful, and persistent, are of as 
great importance to a child as to know that seven 
and eight are fifteen, or that coffee and rubber are 
exports from Brazil. 
4. A fourth means of attracting and holding at- 
tention is by the use of games. The teacher should Use oF game, 
so plan the games that the greatest amount of 
practice is secured by each member of the class. 
Usually the games which permit continued par- 
ticipation by large numbers of the pupils are of 
more value than those in which only a few pupils 
can have active part. Care should be manifested 
that economy of time is secured, that scores are 
consistently kept, and that the games really con- 
tribute to the desired purpose. 
Accuracy in repetition. We have now dis- 
cussed attention as a factor in repetition, as an ele- 
ment in drill. A second essential in repetition is 
accuracy. A continued repetition of an error fixes 
a habit that must later be broken. Drill should 
not be started until the facts are fairly well known
-P-A-G-E-214
  200 PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING APPLIED 
through a development that has been carefully 
planned and executed. The process of work 
should be understood before drill is begun to avoid 
a waste of time and energy by misdirected efforts. 
When possible, pupils should be frequently re- 
quired to check the results of their work during 
drill to insure accuracy. Acquiring a favorable 
attitude toward checking results is of great impor- 
tance, as it encourages self-reliance and independ- 
ence. 
Penalizing inaccurate results is one way of 
calling attention to the importance of accuracy. 
As in all other phases of school work the penalty 
should be appropriate to the particular situa- 
tion, and should tend to improve rather than to 
antagonize the pupil. To lose the opportunity of 
scoring a point for his team is usually a sufficiently 
serious penalty. 
Many pupils become indifferent to low grades, 
but will be aroused to increased effort when the 
grades are shown in the form of a graph. Picto- 
rial representation of progress is a valuable aid to 
the drill lesson. 
Speed in repetition. A third essential to repe- 
tition is speed. The teacher is compelled to face 
two problems in any drill lesson — the child who 
habitually hurries through the work and care- 
lessly neglects accuracy, and the child who is ha- 
bitually slow. Every teacher should analyze her
-P-A-G-E-215
  
THE DRILL LESSON 201 
own attitude and procedure to see if she is uncon- 
sciously emphasizing either of these essentials to 
the exclusion of the other. Both are necessary to 
successful competition in almost every situation 
in life. 
Possible means of securing speed are similar to 
those mentioned in the discussion of attention and 
accuracy — emulation, a time limit, and penaliz- 
ing slowness. Rewarding speed as well as accu- 
racy maintains an equitable adjustment in the 
mind and practice of the pupil. 
A successful teacher of penmanship gave fre- 
quent drills with watch in hand to see how many 
letters were made to the minute. The letters 
were sometimes practiced separately, to empha- 
size form, but the practice was usually on a sen- 
tence to make the drill similar to the practical sit- 
uation in which the required habit was to be used. 
Need of organization. If a series of facts is to 
be drilled upon, the work should be so organized 
as to provide for all the members of a series. In 
learning the multiplication table of eight the pu- 
pil should drill on all the combinations, that he 
may be familiar with the entire sequence. It is 
wise to emphasize the more difficult facts, and 
strive to clinch them in various ways. Care should 
be used that pupils do not get a mental set which 
causes them to regard certain facts as of special 
difficulty through the power of suggestion. 
 
-P-A-G-E-216
  202 PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING APPLIED 
The different members in a series of facts should 
become so familiar that a variation of the order is 
no handicap to either speed or accuracy. It is 
better to learn any series by developing a definite 
concept which is meaningful than by learning 
merely the sequence. Pupils should be taught to 
avoid the tendency to depend upon the arrange- 
ment of facts as a cue to the answer. 
A fact which is of great importance to the 
teacher is to drill on the situation in all the forms 
in which it will be met. The first-grade pupil 
should not be expected to know capital A because 
he has been taught the small letter a, nor should 
the fourth-grade pupil necessarily know how to 
spell “rolling” because he has learned to spell 
“roll.” The second-grade child could not be ex- 
pected to learn that seven and five are twelve at 
the same time that he learns that five and seven 
are twelve, unless he has special help in seeing the 
relation. In all of these illustrations the second 
form should be learned more easily because of the 
apperceptive background established, but there 
is always a need of drill on each new fact rela- 
tion before it can become an habitual response. 
How to obtain best results. If the best results 
are to be obtained from drill work the teacher 
should spread the drill over as long a period as. 
possible, so as to provide for forgetting and re- 
learning. A pupil may know that the past tense  
-P-A-G-E-217
THE DRILL LESSON 203 
  s, 66 
of “know” is “knew”; but he needs to review it 
occasionally, over a long period of time, in order 
to establish its use as a habit. 
V To secure automatic response is the purpose of 
drill. That this same automatic response may 
become habitual is the purpose of extending the 
drill over a wide distribution of time, and of 
lengthening the period between drills. The time 
between drills may be gradually extended, since it 
is true that as the sureness of the correct response 
increases the need of drill diminishes. 
Measuring the results of drill, A second 
means of securing the best results from drill is to 
use all available means of measuring the results 
obtained. The teacher should be familiar with 
standard tests — the practice tests as well as the 
achievement tests — and make use of them in 
measuring the progress of each child. 
The teacher may even have tests which she has 
devised which will serve as temporary standards 
toward which to work; for the achievement of 
which, drill is necessary, and by means of which 
the improvement made through drill may be es- 
timated. Since the standard tests have been 
made by subject-matter specialists who have 
spent much time and effort in devising tests which 
are aimed to cover the essentials in a certain sub- 
ject, it is wiser for the teacher to use a test which 
has been standardized rather than one of her own 
making.

Memorization of poetry. The memorization of 
poetry is a subject of sufficient importance to 
deserve the discussion in special volumes, which 
have been issued by various authors during the 
last decade. Every teacher should know the psy- 
chology of this phase of learning before attempt- 
ing to guide her pupils in this much abused field. 
Memorization of poetry is drill, and all of the 
essential elements of drill may be modified to suit 
its requirements. It also involves development 
and appreciation as well as review. The teacher 
should realize the importance of correct procedure 
in this apparently neglected element of school 
work. 
First, the poem should_be interesting to the 
child. In order to be interesting it must be ap- 
propriate to his age and experience. A recent 
study involving the opinion of hundreds of school 
children throws light upon the selection of poetry 
for the study of elementary-school children. It 
reveals the fact that many poems which have be- 
come traditional in use are much too subtle in 
their meaning to be enjoyed by the child. They 
are poems about children for adult readers, rather 
than poems which appeal to the fanciful imagina- 
tion of childhood. 
A second requirement in the memorization of 
poetry is that the child should hear the poem-as-a 
whole— No teacher would think of doing any-
-P-A-G-E-219
  THE DRILL LESSON 205 
thing so absurd as to cut a beautiful picture into 
equal sections, and say: “Here is a part of this 
picture. Enjoy it and notice everything in it. 
To-morrow, if you can name everything in it, I 
shall give you another piece. Perhaps by Friday 
you will have all the pieces and then you can see 
what the picture is really like.” And yet that is 
done day after day in the memorization of poetry 
by teachers who fail to realize that a poem is a 
work of art and should be appreciated as a uni- 
fied whole. 
After the poem has been read as a whole and 
the significance of the entire theme is understood, 
it is then possible for the child to appreciate the 
relation of each stanza to the whole. Without 
this definite apperceptive background the teacher 
may secure parrot-like repetition, but she will not 
awaken a love for poetry. 
A third requirement in the memorization of 
poetry is thoughtful repetition ofa unit suffi- 
ciently small that the child can grasp the idea of 
unity and have a reasonable hope of remember- 
ing it. 
A fourth requisite of effective memorization is 
the application of the laws of association. Ex- 
planation of difficult words, particular emphasis 
upon rhythm, and attention to rhyme should all 
be considered in order that the repetition may 
_ be meaningful.
-P-A-G-E-220
  206 PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING APPLIED 
A fifth element to be considered is_repetition 
with attention. Variety will aid in this field of 
drill as in any other. Time limits for a particular 
stanza may even be set, with emphasis, of course, 
upon correct expression. 
As a final impression the poem should be re- 
peated as a whole to assure a complete mental pic- 
ture of the work of art. This final repetition may 
be an occasion to notice particular choice of words 
or some element of special beauty. Through 
hearing, the child should gain added pleasure in 
word effects and in literary excellence. 
Memorization of a poem illustrated. A second- 
grade teacher selected “The Wind,” by Christina 
Rossetti, as a possible means of interesting chil- 
dren in the observation of the natural phenome- 
non of the wind, and also to cultivate an apprecia- 
tion of poetry. If poetry is to be enjoyed to the 
fullest extent it is wise to begin early to cultivate 
this tendency. The selection here is well chosen; 
while the theme is somewhat subtle, it is not be- 
yond the grasp of second-grade intellect, and adds 
materially to the child’s stock of ideas and impres- 
sions. The teacher had as secondary aims the 
fostering of an organized attempt to remember, 
coérdination of effort in class, a study in the use of 
good English —a drill in “neither-nor” — and 
appreciation of a change of weather conditions. 
As a special motive the pupils were invited to
-P-A-G-E-221
  ’ THE DRILL LESSON 207 
send representatives to repeat the poem to the 
pupils in the fourth grade. Sharing pleasure is a 
commendable virtue which brings joy to both the 
giver and the receiver, and teachers should en- 
courage this ideal in pupils. The motive in this 
case appealed to the pupil’s natural desire for ap- 
proval and to his instinct for self-expression. 
A mounted picture of wind-tossed trees growing 
by the wayside, and also a girl with skirts and 
hair flying, was shown to the class. The teacher 
here shows an appreciation of the value of visual 
education. The law of vividness is demonstrated, 
as interest is increased by this vivid illustration. 
The children freely discussed the picture for a 
few minutes, with very few questions asked. The 
ability to remain in the background and encour- 
age a maximum of pupil activity is here dem- 
onstrated. Freedom of discussion encourages 
independent thinking and individual initiative, 
qualities very necessary to real appreciation. 
Then an attempt was made to organize the 
ideas by such questions as: 
1. What kind of day do you think the picture shows? 
2. Do we have any days like it now? 
8. Why do you think it was a windy day? 
4. Can you see the wind? How do you know that it 
is about? 
5. What is happening to the girl? To the trees? 
The questions are well chosen. They call for 
just the right answers to build the apperceptive
-P-A-G-E-222
    208 PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING APPLIED 
basis for the presentation of the new material. 
The teacher then continued: “Listen to what a 
very talented woman whose name was Christina 
Rossetti says about the wind blowing in the 
trees.” She then repeats the entire poem:? 
“Who has seen the wind? 
Neither I nor you. 
But when the leaves hang trembling, 
The wind is passing through. 
“Who has seen the wind? 
Neither you nor I. 
But when the trees bow down their heads, 
The wind is passing by.” 
The introduction of the poem as the natural ex- 
pression of a woman whom the teacher calls by 
name emphasizes the simplicity of poetry, and 
tends to remove the oft-present tendency to think 
of it as a thing apart from the natural views of 
life. The simplicity and beauty of the poem are 
emphasized by repetition as a whole. This com- 
plete unity of the thought is the first step in econ- 
omy of memorization. 
Next the teacher introduced questions to call 
attention to the thought: “When a very light 
wind is blowing what happens to the leaves on 
the trees? How does Christina Rossetti say it?” 
She then repeated the first stanza once. Then 
the children were asked to whisper it softly while

Macmillan Company Publishers. 
 
-P-A-G-E-223
  
THE DRILL LESSON 209 
she repeated it a second time. Two or three 
children volunteered to repeat it. A choice was 
made as to who repeated it the best. 
With the meaning clear this repetition of the 
first stanza again presented it as a whole. Whis- 
pering it softly while the teacher repeats makes | 
use of kinzesthetic imagery without spoiling the 
beauty of accuracy by making mistakes. Vol- 
untary repetition keeps the entire recitation on 
the plane of pleasure. Having the pupils select 
the best performer threw the responsibility of a 
decision upon the class. This added to the inter- 
est and developed a thoughtful attitude and dis- 
crimination in judgment. 
The teacher then asked: ‘When a very strong 
wind is blowing, what happens to the tops of the 
trees? What does Christina Rossetti say that the 
trees are doing? Would you like to be trees and 
bow down your heads?” The last two lines were 
quickly dramatized, which introduced a new ele- 
ment of interest, by appealing to the pupil’s in- 
stinct for physical activity. 
As with the first stanza the pupils were asked 
to repeat the second stanza softly while the 
teacher repeated it, and then volunteers recited it. 
The poem was then given as a whole by several 
different pupils, and a pupil was chosen by the 
class to repeat it the next day during the opening 
exercises in the fourth-grade room.

EDUCATIONAL PRINCIPLES INVOLVED IN 
THE FOREGOING DISCUSSION 
. The purpose of drill is to make habitual in the life of 
the pupil certain responses that will be most often 
needed. 
. The most effective drill is that for which the pupil has a 
real motive based upon a life interest. 
. Repetition is essential to drill, and should always be 
accompanied by attention, accuracy, and speed. 
. Attention may be secured by varying the procedure, 
setting a time limit, appealing to the instinct of emu- 
lation, and by the use of games. 
. Accuracy may be secured by encouraging pupils to 
check results, by penalizing inaccuracy, and by graphi- 
cally portraying individual and class progress. 
. The teacher should analyze her procedure that she may 
emphasize the necessary elements in repetition, includ- 
ing speed. 
. In organizing the drill lesson the teacher should take 
precaution to include all of the different members in a 
series, and drill on the situation in all the forms in which 
it will be met. 
. The best results in drill are obtained by spreading the 
drill over a long period-of time, by lengthening the 
period between drills, and by measuring the results ob- 
tained. 
. In the memorization of poetry, the pupil should be in- 
terested in the poem, hear it as a whole, understand and 
repeat the various units as a whole, and as a final im- 
pression, repeat the poem in its entirety. 
PROBLEMS FOR INVESTIGATION AND 
DISCUSSION 
. Name five essential elements in a specific drill lesson in 
geography.

  CHAPTER XIV 
THE LESSON FOR APPRECIATION 
Value of in the present period. In this decade 
of commercial supremacy, when the progress in 
scientific invention is so great that it is almost im- 
possible to keep informed as to its advancement, 
it is especially necessary for the public schools to 
determine their policy and objectives with unu- 
sual discrimination. 
It is easy for a nation, which is without doubt 
enjoying the greatest financial and political su- 
premacy in its history, to overemphasize the ma- 
terialistic phase of progress. It is difficult to 
draw the attention of the people to the impor- 
tance of educational advantages in keeping with 
the new problems which the children of the pres- 
ent generation must solve when they assume the 
responsibilities of citizenship. 
Much as we may deplore the ease with which 
the nation neglects its youth, much as we may re- 
alize the difficulty of moulding public opinion, the 
fact still remains that a large part of the respon- 
sibility must be met by the public schools. If 
each teacher would but recognize the responsibil- 
ity and accept it as a challenge to her highest in- 
genuity, there need be no fear as to the outcome 
for the future. 
 
-P-A-G-E-227
    
THE LESSON FOR APPRECIATION 213 
It is the teacher’s privilege to counterbalance 
the extravagant dissipation of mental, moral, and 
physical force, by a program which emphasizes 
the eternal values of truth and beauty, as mani- 
fested in the many forms of art, literature, music, 
and science. A noble enjoyment of the best in 
our civilization provides for a wise choice in the 
use of leisure time, and helps to fortify for the 
exigencies of a busy and strenuous life. 
The lesson for appreciation may be a powerful 
influence for good in the life of the child, or it may 
be a waste of time, or even a positive detriment if 
the teacher is not conscious of the educational 
principles involved. 
The purpose of the appreciation lesson. The 
first requisite of success in conducting the lesson 
for appreciation is, that the teacher must know the 
purposes which underlie this phase of school work. 
The general purpose of any appreciation lesson 
is to enable the child to enjoy the contributions 
which are the social heritage of our present age. 
The specific purposes and the form of the lesson 
will of necessity vary as the contribution to be 
enjoyed is a poem, a story, a picture, a dance, a 
piece of pottery, a scientific experiment, or music, 
either vocal or instrumental. 
There are certain principles which should guide 
the teacher in any appreciation lesson, the observ- 
ance of which will enable her to conduct the lesson 
   
-P-A-G-E-228
  214 PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING APPLIED 
in an intelligent manner, instead of in the haphaz- 
ard fashion which leaves the outcome to chance. 
Ability to appreciate that which she is teaching. 
No teacher should attempt to guide in apprecia- 
tion until she can appreciate that which she is 
teaching. Sincerity is easily recognized by chil- 
dren, and goes far in influencing their feelings in 
regard to a subject. It is the child’s emotions 
which we are attempting to reach by the appre- 
ciation lesson. True, the intellect is involved, 
but the prime objective is to get the child to feel 
rather than to know. 
There are too many beautiful poems, songs, 
stories, and pictures for the teacher to feel com- 
pelled to teach one which does not appeal to her 
own esthetic sense. 
No teacher should introduce a fad in the school- 
room in the name of art. If the teacher has de- 
veloped her own esthetic appreciation in a com- 
prehensive manner, she will be able to select that 
which she can enthusiastically bring before her 
class, and still avoid the sensational or the unu- 
sual. When pupils have a thorough background 
for forming judgments, they will then be in a posi- 
tion to have the unusual presented without fear 
of prejudice. 
If a teacher feels that her own training in appre- 
ciation has been neglected, she should enrich her 
life by wide observation and reading in order to 
 
-P-A-G-E-229
THE LESSON FOR APPRECIATION 215 
bring to her class a sincere enjoyment of that 
which is best. 
Importance of correct imagery. Pupils will 
vary in their natural tendencies in imagery. The 
teacher should study to increase her ability to aid 
pupils to acquire correct imagery. The pupil who 
is extremely observant when visual imagery is 
concerned may enjoy the beauty of a picture, but 
may be indifferent to the beauty of a song. The 
teacher may call attention to clarity of tone, repe- 
tition in rhythm, variety in tempo, pleasing recur- 
rence of rhyme, as exhibited in various simple and 
beautiful selections, until the pupil becomes sen- 
sitive to the auditory imagery. 
If visual imagery is deficient, the child may be 
helped to fuller enjoyment by having his attention 
called to harmony of color, effects of light and 
shadows, various principles of composition and 
perspective, and by experimentation with differ- 
ent arrangements of shapes and sizes to secure 
pleasing effects, until visual acuity is developed 
sufficiently to be stimulated by the field of 
art. 
Necessity of direct contact. Few people are 
gifted with an imagination which will enable 
them to enjoy completely that which is merely 
described or talked about. Pupils need to be 
brought into direct contact with the various con- 
tributions which we wish them to enjoy. In this  
-P-A-G-E-230
  
216 PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING APPLIED 
day when nearly every school has a victrola it is 
easy to appeal to the child’s enjoyment of music. 
Great care should be used that the child may be- 
come familiar with a variety of selections that his 
appreciation may be based upon intelligent selec- 
.tion. Too often the teacher uses only those re- 
cords which catch the fancy of the child without 
helping him to acquire a larger background for 
appreciation. 
Whenever possible teachers should take their 
classes to art museums where a real contact with 
pictures, pottery, sculpture, and other forms of 
art will make its own appeal. Such excursions 
should be carefully planned and center about a 
definite theme during any particular visit. 
When the art museum is not available, the 
teacher may use reproductions of the master- 
pieces, which have been reproduced in prints so 
reasonable in price that they are not prohibitive 
in any classroom. 
The field of children’s literature is rich in child 
classics which pupils should be permitted to enjoy 
in great abundance. Teachers should seek to sur- 
round the child with more than he can read in 
order to stimulate choice. If early influences de- 
velop an interest in wholesome literature there 
need be little fear in regard to the future reading 
of the child. He should be enticed by the interest 
in the story rather than spurred on by the artifi-
-P-A-G-E-231
THE LESSON FOR APPRECIATION 217 
cial snobbishness that he is reading that which is 
generally approved. 
Value of spontaneous expression. The teacher 
who has the happy faculty of keeping her own 
ideas in the background and letting the subject 
which she wishes to be appreciated occupy the 
center of the pupil’s thoughts will usually secure 
greater spontaneity of expression than the one 
who tries to impose her own viewpoint upon the 
pupils before they are ready for it. 
A third-grade teacher read a poem to her pu- 
pils, then said to each one in turn: “Do you love 
this poem? Why do you love it?” When con- 
fronted with this positive question the pupils were 
led away from the emotional pleasure which the 
poem may have occasioned, into the realism of an 
intellectual response. The result was one of the 
most mechanical recitations which the writer has 
ever witnessed. 
In less than five minutes the teacher had re- 
peated the word “love” eighteen times. The pu- 
pils were floundering between an attempt to please 
the teacher and a genuine unpleasant reaction to 
this too personal question. 
It is not usually wise to urge a pupil to tell why 
he likes or does not like a selection, character, pic- 
ture, or poem. Such subtle analysis may serve to 
obviate the purpose of the lesson, a genuine en- 
joyment of the created product of another’s art.
-P-A-G-E-232
  218 PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING APPLIED 
If he can be led to discuss the issue spontaneously, 
and voluntarily state reasons for his opinion, the 
class may profit by his discussion, and his own 
convictions may become clearer, but he should 
not be urged to give reasons for his enjoy- 
ment. 
Spontaneity of expression is the natural out- 
come of real appreciation, and should be stimu- 
lated in every possible way. One of the deplorable 
tendencies of our modern society is to suppress all 
show of real emotional enthusiasm and originality 
of taste. 
Artificial sentimentality and garrulous verbos- 
ity should be curbed, but real sentiment needs 
encouragement. 
The youth of to-day should not be ashamed to 
admit a love for the beautiful in whatever field it 
may be found; he should find in the classroom an 
atmosphere of appreciation so natural, so whole- 
some and unaffected that it will influence his 
thinking and conduct in other life associations. 
The diffidence which the average person shows 
in the expression of esthetic appreciation is 
partly due to the fear that he is posing as superior. 
In our loyalty to democracy we should beware 
lest we encourage mediocrity. An equitable op- 
portunity for all children to enjoy the best should 
be the aim of the public school, but equitable op- 
portunity should not be accomplished by lowering
-P-A-G-E-233
  THE LESSON FOR APPRECIATION 219 
standards, rather by attaining higher levels of ap- 
preciation for all. 
Ability to supply informational facts. It is very 
essential to the success of the appreciation lesson 
that the teacher should have the ability to supply 
pupils with a sufficient background of facts to 
comprehend the thought of the author, speaker, 
composer, inventor, or artist. 
Too much technical information may at times 
be a hindrance to enjoyment, if the observer is in- 
clined to be overcritical and the performance is at 
all inferior, but this surplus of information need 
not interfere with the field of appreciation in 
which the elementary school may function. It is 
the teacher’s privilege to add to the pupil’s fund 
of information in order that he may appreciate 
the work of any individual or of any natural 
beauty which has contributed to his enjoyment. 
The appreciation of scientific progress is par- 
ticularly dependent upon an intellectual compre- 
hension of the history of the experiment from its 
inception to its completion. 
The appreciation of any historical event or 
period, of the drama or any other literary produc- 
tion, demands a comprehension of human rela- 
tions, of cause and effect, and of informational 
facts of various kinds, The facts should never 
be so abundantly introduced, or so ponderously 
given, that the pupil’s joy in the lesson is de-
-P-A-G-E-234
220 PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING APPLIED 
    stroyed. The teacher’s function is that of an in- 
terpreter, who enables the pupils to understand 
the work of the master. 
The relation of creative work to appreciation. 
If wisely directed, the opportunity for creative 
work is a means of raising the pupil’s standards 
of appreciation. The elementary school is not the 
place for specialization in any subject, however 
interesting it may be; but there is no reason why 
the atmosphere found therein should not con- 
tribute in every way possible to a pupil’s appre- 
ciation of art in any form. 
The teacher should realize the distinction be- © 
tween fostering creative effort, as an end in itself, © 
and encouraging it as an aid to enjoyment. The 
pupil who attempts to imitate a poem, create a 
song, or mould a vase, will usually have, there- 
after, a different attitude toward the creative 
work of the poet, the musician, or the potter. 
Such creative effort should always be on the 
plane of pleasure, and so arranged that the timid 
pupil is not embarrassed. It often happens that 
the sensitive child is offended by the crudity of 
his own efforts, and hesitates, where a less appre- 
ciative pupil will venture without such esthetic 
scruples. A teacher should study the tendencies 
and interests of her pupils before committing 
them to the embarrassment of attempting that 
for which they are in no way prepared.

  ‘THE LESSON FOR APPRECIATION 221 
A fifth-grade teacher was successful in interest- 
ing her class in writing a poem as a class project. 
In order to show the spontaneity of the children, 
and the ability of the teacher to suggest without 
dominating, the entire lesson is here reproduced. 
Teacher: “Children, I am going to read you a poem. 
I shall read it three times; first, that you may get the 
story, second, that you may get the poetic expression, . 
and third, that you may feel the rhythm.” 
On tHE Wine 
By William Motherwell 
I’ve plucked the berry from the bush, the brown nut from 
the tree, 
But heart of happy little bird ne’er broken was by me. 
I saw them in their curious nests, close crouching, slyly peer, 
With their wild eyes, like glittering beads, to note if harm 
were near; 
I passed them by, and blessed them all; I felt that it was good 
To leave unmoved the creatures small whose home was in the 
wood. 
And here, even now, above my head, a lusty rogue doth sing; 
He pecks his swelling breast and neck, and trims his little 
wing. 
He will not fly; he knows full well, while chirping on that 
spray, 
I would not harm for all the world, or interrupt his lay. 
Sing on, sing on, blithe bird! and fill my heart with summer 
gladness; 
It has been aching many a day with measures full of sadness. 
Different pupils were then asked to sing the 
rhythm with loo. After several attempts the 
class as a whole entered into the spirit and fol- 
lowed the rhythm very successfully. The pupils

assented joyfully when asked if they would like to 
write a poem about a bird. After a little discus- 
sion, they decided that it would be better to write 
as a class in order to benefit by the opinions and 
criticism of the group. 
Teacher: “Then we shall make it aclass poem. Try 
to suggest two lines at a time, if possible. I shall write 
your offerings on the board, and then you may select 
the best. ‘Think carefully; imagine yourself out in the 
wood, a little bird, and get into the spirit of love and 
beauty as much as possible.” 
(No response for as much as two minutes; all think- 
ing.) 
Mildred: “A little bird sat on his nest, 
His heart was full of gladness.” 
(Teacher writes.) 
Helen: “The sky is blue, the grass is green — I can’t 
get the next line, but it ought to be about the birds 
singing.” 
Mabel: “The thrush so brown is singing.” 
Teacher: “I think either of those is a good start. 
Which do you think is the better? Let us see how 
many prefer the last two lines given.... How many 
prefer the first two lines? ... Why do you choose the 
first two, Mathol?” 
Mathol: “It makes me think of the little birds that 
, will come, and of all the things that might happen. I 
think it is an easier story.” 
Teacher: “That is one good reason. Now let us 
build the next thought with two lines.” (There was 
serious thinking, but no response, so the teacher sug- 
gested:) 
“He had no care, his wants were few — ’” 
Mary: “Oh, yes! and then — 
He had not heard of sadness.”

Teacher: “Shall we call this one stanza? Then we 
shall start on another.” 
Paul: “How many shall we have?” 
Teacher: “How many do you think, class?” 
Chester: “I think we shall have to tell that by our 
story.” 
Teacher: “If the length is to depend upon our story, 
shall we think again of the story?” 
Mabel: “He always loved his fellowmen, 
He had not learned to fear them.” 
Class: “That’s fine! That’s all right.” 
Mathew: “I don’t like that ‘fellowmen.’” 
Teacher: “I don’t quite like it myself, but suppuse 
we let it go now, and then come back and polish? 
Who is ready with the next thought?” 
Jordan: “He loved to sing while flying, 
He liked to have them near him.” 
Ross: “‘ He loved to sing while flying’ — that doesn’t 
sound right.” 
Teacher: “ What is the trouble?” 
Ross: “It doesn’t say lo loo lo loo, lo loo lo loo.” 
Teacher: “Suppose we change ‘flying’ to another 
expression that means the same.” 
Robert: “I know — ‘on the wing. 
Teacher: “Do you like that, class? ... Now let us 
have something happen in this third stanza that will 
keep up the interest. What would be a natural thing 
to expect?” 
James: “I think there would soon be some little 
birds.” 
Sara: “His happy time one day had come 
When little birds came forth.” 
Mathew: “He had to go get some worms 
While mother’s darlings slept.” 
Mildred: “That will not do. We have called the 
bird ‘he’ all the time, and now we say, ‘Mother’s dar- 999

and I don’t like that — let’s say, ‘While little birdies 
slept.’” 
Teacher: “What do you think, Mathew?” 
Mathew: “Yes. We'll have to go back and fix it all 
the way through.” 
Teacher: “Suppose that we hold that in mind, but 
continue until we have finished the poem.” 
Garland: “I know what I want to say, but I can’t 
say it right — ‘A little boy came along with a sling in 
his hand.’” 
Dean: “Let’s not have him hurt the bird; maybe 
he belongs to a bird club. Why not say — 
“Along the path a schoolboy came, 
A sling shot in his hand.” 
Mabel: “He raised to shoot and then remembered 
about the club. We could say — ‘He raised to shoot 
and then thought’ — but I can’t think of anything to 
thyme with hand — land does, Miss L. — what could 
we say?” 
Teacher: “‘This is a freeman’s land.’... Now we 
are ready to straighten out the rough places. What ~ 
shall we substitute for ‘his fellowmen’?” 
Helen: “We might say ‘birds.’” 
- William: “But she wouldn’t be afraid of birds.” 
Mary: “Yes. That makes that place all right; but 
look at the fourth line; if you change ‘him’ to ‘her,’ 
then it doesn’t sound right. It doesn’t rhyme.” 
Loren: “We must have something to rhyme with 
‘them’; could it be another ‘them’?” 
Mildred: “It pleased her to be near them.” 
Mabel: “There is ‘come’ in the first line of the next 
stanza, and ‘came’ in the second line. That doesn’t 
sound well.” 
After a little more discussion the class finally 
pronounced the poem complete. They had spent

forty minutes, not in learning to be poets, but 
in learning to appreciate the elements which 
make poetry pleasing. Their finished poem fol- 
lows: 
A little bird sat on her nest, 
Her heart was full of gladness. 
She had no care, her wants were few, 
She had not heard of sadness. 
She always loved the creatures round, 
She had not learned to fear them. 
She loved to sing while on the wing, 
It pleased her to be near them. 
Her happy time one day had come 
When forth the birdies crept. 
She had to go to get some worms 
While all the darlings slept. 
Along the path a schoolboy came, 
A sling shot in his hand; 
He raised to shoot and then he thought — 
This is a freeman’s land. 
EDUCATIONAL PRINCIPLES INVOLVED IN 
THE FOREGOING DISCUSSION 
1. Since the rapid progress in civilization encourages a 
tendency toward commercialism, the public school 
should be a potent factor in establishing zesthetic ideals, 
2. The purpose of the appreciation lesson is to enable the 
pupil to enjoy the accumulation from the past of the 
best in art, literature, music, and science; that he may 
appreciate more completely his social heritage. 
8. The teacher should strive to elevate and extend her 
own standards, and teach only that which she herself 
appreciates, since much of the value in such a lesson 
comes from the sharing of enthusiasm.
-P-A-G-E-240
  226 PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING APPLIED 
4. The pupil should be brought into direct contact with 
that which it is desired to have him appreciate; and va- 
rious means should be used to enable him to acquire 
correct imagery. 
5. Spontaneity of expression without artificial cant should 
be the goal if the appreciation is to be genuine. 
6. Informational facts should be furnished to the extent 
- that they are necessary to put the pupils in the frame 
of mind for enjoyment. 
7. Creative effort on the part of pupils may serve to 
heighten appreciation, if the work is planned to suit the 
ability of the individuals, and is kept on the plane of 
pleasure. In creative work originality in expression of 
ideas should be encouraged rather than perfection of 
technique, although the child should be held respon- 
sible for the best work of which he is capable. 
PROBLEMS FOR INVESTIGATION AND 
DISCUSSION 
1. Name five ways in which a teacher may improve her 
own cultural background for appreciation. 
2. Show how a school could hold an art exhibit, consist- 
ing of reprints from masterpieces, thereby increasing 
the appreciation of pupils and community for the best 
in art. 
8. What informational facts would you introduce in order 
to increase the appreciation of a fifth-grade class for the 
poem, “The Arab and His Steed,” by Mrs. Norton? 
~ 4. Write an outline of a lesson for Grade 4 for the appre- 
ciation of “The Anvil Chorus” from Il Trovatore. 
5. To what extent should a teacher cultivate her ability in 
story-telling as an aid in the teaching of appreciation?

CHAPTER XV 
THE PROJECT METHOD OF TEACHING 
Muczs superficial work has been done in the name 
of project teaching, which has prejudiced many 
people against a method which undoubtedly has 
its foundations in sound psychological principles. 
It is inevitable that any educational idea ex- 
perimented with by visionary teachers as well as 
by those of more conservative tendencies should 
be carried to an impractical extreme by certain 
teachers of the one group, and declared a superfi- 
cial fad by many of the latter group. 
Thoughtful teachers for many years have used 
principles which are now classified as belonging to 
the project method; but the experimentation of 
the last decade has enriched the educational field 
with definite descriptions and concrete applica- 
tions, which have proved the worth of this method 
with which every teacher should be familiar. 
The project method defined. The project 
method, briefly described, is that method of 
teaching which encourages a maximum amount 
of purposeful activity on the part of the pupils. 
This activity may be concerned with intellectual 
problems, with mechanical manipulations and 
constructions, with physical performances, with
-P-A-G-E-243
THE PROJECT METHOD OF TEACHING 229 
appreciations, or with a combination of any or all 
of these elements, with emphasis upon the social 
aspect of the situation both as to the worth of 
the project, and the way it is conceived and exe- 
cuted. 
Much discussion has been incurred by a differ- 
ence of opinion as to whether project teaching is 
more concerned with the results obtained, with 
the method of work, or with the attitude of the 
pupil. Material results are necessary. What the 
public demands the schools must supply to a 
certain extent; but the schools will not live up 
to their full responsibility until the results are 
achieved through methods that contribute to the 
highest moral and social conduct of the individuals 
participating. Those ends in themselves are best 
which are achieved through methods that are in- 
telligently and wisely selected, and which in their 
achievement create and foster ideals which are so- 
cially desirable. 
Every successful teacher has consciously or un- 
consciously observed four steps in her teaching. 
She has purposed a particular lesson, planned it 
more or less in detail, executed the proposed plans, 
and judged or tested the results. 
The most significant fact about project teach- 
ing is the fact that instead of the teacher alone 
performing these four steps, the pupils have a 
definite responsibility in each of the four phases of 
 
-P-A-G-E-244
    280 PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING APPLIED 
the procedure. This pupil responsibility has been 
the cause of much of the confusion which has 
arisen in the use of the method. Many teachers 
have failed to analyze the situation in order to be 
able to discriminate in assuming and relegating 
responsibility. 
What, then, is the teacher’s function in the pro- 
ject method of teaching? 
Purposing. There are two phases in each step 
of the teacher’s procedure, consideration and parti- 
cipation. In purposing any project she must con- 
sider the social aspect, the source and relation to 
life of the project. Second, she must consider the 
psychological aspect, the appropriateness of the 
project to the capacities of the pupils. Third, 
she must consider the stimulating qualities of the 
work to lead forward to projects on higher levels. 
The participation by the teacher consists in se- 
curing expressions of the pupils to reveal inter- 
ests and experience basis, focusing attention upon 
specific elements in the project to give it definite- 
ness and pointedness, suggesting possibilities and 
life relationships to stimulate further interests, 
and to reveal further the desirability and worth of 
the work. 
Planning. Having reviewed the field in order 
to select a project of real worth, the teacher’s next 
step is to plan. Here, again, the two elements, 
consideration and participation occur. The
-P-A-G-E-245
  
THE PROJECT METHOD OF TEACHING 231 
teacher must first consider the kinds of pupil ac- 
tivity required. 
There may be investigating, which may consist 
in excursions, individual observations, reading, 
experiments, or asking questions. Second, there 
may be constructing, producing, or interpreting, 
which involve using materials, words, drawings, 
designs, tones, or movements. 
Third, there may be development of skills by 
practice or drill. These skills may be a combina- 
tion of mental-physical activity, such as penman- 
ship, oral reading, or dancing. They may be de- 
cidedly mental, such as fixing processes or memo- 
rizing; or they may involve creative expression, 
which as skills have very little place in the ele- 
mentary school, since creative effort with the 
young child is more for the purpose of apprecia- 
tion than for the development of skill. A fourth 
kind of pupil activity is appreciating, or enjoying 
experiences by active or relatively passive par- 
ticipation. 
Besides this consideration of the kinds of pupil 
activity to be employed, the teacher should con- 
sider the general organization of the project; in 
what order each activity should be introduced, 
how much time may be required, and what mate- 
rials are to be desired. 
Participation in planning on the part of the 
teacher consists in (1) securing proposals of worth, 
 
-P-A-G-E-246
  232 PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING APPLIED 
(2) leading pupils to plan the procedure, to con- 
sider the materials required, and to organize the 
steps in procedure. 
She is responsible for guiding in the evaluation 
and selection of these proposed activities, for lead- 
ing pupils to consider the relative value of the va- 
rious elements of the project as a whole, and of 
the pertinence and value of the proposals made. 
It is the teacher’s business to encourage group 
activity and individual participation in the organi- 
zation of the work. She must lead the pupils to 
fix upon the first step of the procedure, to deter- 
mine each succeeding step, and to develop a defi- 
nite method of procedure for the step immediately 
to be taken. 
Execution. Having purposed the project, and 
having planned it in detail, the teacher must then 
face the actual situation of executing the proposed 
plans. She should ask herself the two important 
questions: What elements need my consideration 
in the execution of the proposed project? How 
am I to participate? © 
She must conisider first the ability of the pupils 
as a group and as individuals; also the codperation 
necessary in carrying forward the common pur- 
pose. She must next consider economy of time, 
effort, and materials; always keeping in mind pu- 
pil welfare. 
She must consider the relative value of different
-P-A-G-E-247
THE PROJECT METHOD OF TEACHING 233 
  methods of procedure, choosing those which place 
definite responsibility upon the pupils, which lead 
them to consider the value of their own procedure, 
and their proposed contributions in carrying on 
the work, and which help to organize their ideas 
and activities most effectively. 
Having given careful consideration to the 
above-named elements in the situation,\ the 
teacher should participate in the execution of the 
project by furnishing incentives to useful activity. 
She should help in every reasonable way to lead 
pupils to accomplish the purpose of the project, 
but without depriving them of any opportunity 
to do for themselves anything which by reasonable 
effort they can do. 
The teacher should provide working materials 
which the pupils cannot provide. With her more 
extensive knowledge she should be able to select 
illustrative and reference material which the pu- 
pils may overlook or not be able to find. She 
may assist by questions and suggestions, and by 
making personal contributions when needed to 
stimulate and direct the movement forward. 
It is the teacher’s important function to secure 
unity of effort; exerting sufficient leadership to 
keep all activity within the limits of helpfulness 
in carrying on the work, and to avoid waste and 
wandering from the purpose. 
Judging and testing. No part of the project is
-P-A-G-E-248
284 PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING APPLIED 
  more fundamental to the pupil’s attitude toward 
any life issue than to be able to judge of the worth 
of results. This implies a use of knowledge, and 
removes the work from the plane of the theoreti- 
cal to the plane of actual achievement. 
To be open-minded toward one’s own method of 
work, one’s own attainment, is a quality some- 
what rare, but nevertheless an attribute much to 
be desired and one that is necessary to successful 
adaptation to the needs of life. 
In this final step in project teaching the teacher 
should consider the necessity of the pupils’ them- 
selves determining the pertinence of methods and 
contributions offered in relation to their effect 
upon the realization of the purpose. 
She must consider the degree of responsibility 
to be placed upon the pupils in judging the results 
of their work, in determining when and how well 
they have accomplished what they set out to do. 
She must consider that the pupils need help in set- 
ting up standards and in learning means of testing 
the quality of work. 
In actual participation the teacher should ask 
questions and make suggestions which will lead 
pupils to establish standards. She should guide 
in the evaluation of contributions. The nature of 
her guidance will vary as the contributions to be 
evaluated may vary. These contributions may be 
suggestions, opinions, materials, words, drawings,
-P-A-G-E-249
  
THE PROJECT METHOD OF TEACHING 235 
designs, tones, movements, or finished products. 
It is the teacher’s duty to provide tests and 
measurements which will enable the pupils to 
have a scientific standard as a criterion for judg- 
ing their achievement, and by means of which 
they may form intelligent opinions. The teacher 
should also encourage individual standards that 
each pupil may feel inspired to achieve the best 
results of which he is capable. 
Project teaching and the teacher of a special 
subject. In schools having the departmental sys- 
tem of instruction, or many supervisors of special 
subjects, what relation should exist between 
the supervisor of a special subject and project 
teaching? 
By devoting all of her time to a particular sub- 
ject the supervisor or special teacher has the 
advantage of concentration, and may reasonably 
be expected to do some research work. Taking 
it for granted that the supervisor has definite 
educational theories in accordance with modern 
views, she may be accredited with having wider 
knowledge of subject-matter and a more thorough 
grasp of methods in her particular subject than 
has the average grade teacher. She is, therefore, 
equipped to aid the teacher under her supervision 
in meeting the difficulties peculiar to her own 
field. 
The most salient difficulty is that of the spe-
-P-A-G-E-250
236 PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING APPLIED 
  cialist in any field — a narrow vision. There are 
some natures so richly endowed with a sense of 
humor that such dangers need not be guarded 
against; but the average individual is so seriously 
bent on achievement against the various forces of 
competition that he loses his sense of perspective, 
and, fearing that he will become submerged in the 
great mass of mediocrity, becomes a bigot, jeal- 
ously guarding his professional sphere from en- 
croachment. 
This overemphasis upon a special field tends to 
defeat one of the most useful purposes of the pro- 
ject method; namely, to make the various phases 
of school work “ life-units.”’ The project by de- 
finition is broader than any single subject. This 
suggests, then, one more problem of adjustment 
between the field of educational theory and that 
of educational administration. It can be solved 
only by careful evaluation of the theories and 
practices already in use, with open-minded atti- 
tude toward rational experimentation. 
Difficulties to be overcome. What, then, are the 
peculiar difficulties which the supervisor of a spe- 
cial subject must overcome? To make the treat- 
ment specific, let us consider the situation from 
the point of view of the teacher of English. The 
absence of a worked-out procedure demands the 
courage of conviction and necessitates unusual 
caution.
-P-A-G-E-251
  
THE PROJECT METHOD OF TEACHING 237 
Since projects are “life-units,”’ the teacher of 
English must recognize the close correlation of her 
subject with all of the other subjects. This will 
demand a more detailed knowledge of other sub- 
jects than has hitherto been required. 
The English “ possibilities ” in almost any pro- 
ject are very numerous. It is the English super- 
visor who must be counted on to be a guide in 
wise selection, that pupils may acquire the knowl- 
edge and skills that are most worth while. A 
strong unifying force is necessary if procedure is to 
be well balanced. For this reason, a well-qualified 
teacher, of high professional training, for each 
room is highly desirable. 
If a school has departmental organization, 
great care should be exercised that there is a cen- 
tralizing scheme to secure codperation and unifi- 
cation of effort. In such a situation the director 
or principal of the school might well be the organ- 
izing force, with a conference council of all su- 
pervisors and room teachers. In this group a 
democratic spirit should prevail, for here should 
be submitted possible project proposals, the rel- 
ative values of which may be a frequent subject 
for discussion. To illustrate: 
If the geography teacher is emphasizing the 
geography of Europe and pupils are interested 
in the people of these countries, she should have 
the privilege of suggesting that the informa- 
 
-P-A-G-E-252
238 PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING APPLIED 
  tional reading which the pupils will need in this 
field might well occupy a portion of the reading 
periods. 
The English teacher, taking her cue from this, 
could introduce many of the poems and stories 
of these European countries. She is, therefore, 
giving to the pupils the best in her own field at a 
time when it will be most acceptable, because the 
geography instruction has built the situation and 
made the pupils receptive. 
The English teacher may go so far as to lead 
the pupils to wish to produce a pageant in which 
the various European countries are represented. 
Now the emphasis changes: geography must come 
in as the informational subject, and English be- 
comes the guiding factor. As the pupils plan the 
pageant they will realize the great need of geo- 
graphical and historical accuracy, thus an incen- 
tive for careful study in these subjects is pro- 
vided. 
The writing of the play gives abundant oppor- 
tunity for oral and written expression; and even 
makes drill a voluntary act on the part of the 
pupils as their interest in a real production in- 
creases. 
As the needs of the class demand, the music 
supervisor should respond with songs from each 
country; the supervisor of physical training 
should teach the folk-dances of which there are so
-P-A-G-E-253
THE PROJECT METHOD OF TEACHING 239 
many; while the supervisor of sewing directs the 
making of the costumes, and the art teacher 
guides in the making of stage effects, posters, 
and invitations. 
While this is but a suggestion taken from the ex- 
perience of the writer, it will readily be recognized 
that such a proceeding would be advantageous, 
not because it bears the name of project, but be- 
cause it contributes to the best development of 
the pupils by appealing to their natural interest in 
group activity. 
It will also be recognized that such a proce- 
dure demands a staff of very efficient supervisors 
and teachers, each of whom is deeply interested 
in modern educational theory, all of whom are 
equipped with professional skill, have a codpera- 
tive and optimistic attitude, and, above all, are 
genuinely interested in the welfare of the chil- 
dren. 
Value of the project method. What is the 
value of the project method? Is it of such value 
that we should make a place for it in our educa- 
tional scheme, even at a risk of a reorganization 
of ideas and offices — even at the expense of 
breaking down logical barriers that have sepa- 
rated highly specialized fields of knowledge? 
When attempting to enumerate the values to 
be derived from project teaching, one is reminded 
of the patent medicine label which advertises a
-P-A-G-E-254
240. PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING APPLIED 
cure-all for any ailment; or, if in a satirical mood, 
it might be likened to an educational “ millennial 
dawn” with nothing more to be desired. 
It is claims of this sort that have created some 
prejudice against the method; and there are still 
many educators who are quite honest in their be- 
lief that the project is more or less of a fad which 
has disturbed the surface of our educational seas 
for a time; they are quite confident that the tides 
of learning will soon roll along in their accustomed 
courses. : 
If a teacher believes in this method and wishes 
to further its advancement, if she has even a small 
part in the steering of the educational craft, she 
should carry plenty of the ballast of common 
sense, that the bark may not be shipwrecked be- 
fore it is fairly launched. 
Recognizing the dangers involved, and the 
many cautions necessary for a successful use of 
the project method, the writer is still willing to 
claim for it the following values. The statements 
are not meant to advance any new proposition. 
They are merely a reorganization of the opinions 
of well-known educators, which her own experi- 
ence verifies, and which she wishes to emphasize. 
  1. Subject-matter is considered in the way that peo- 
ple in general consider it; in its bearing on life’s 
activities. 
2. It is the natural method of learning, through

. It gives emphasis to attitudes. 
a. It challenges the ability of the pupils; 
arouses the determination to win. 
b. Its appeal to the social, intellectual, and 
emotional aspects, arouses greater interest 
and enthusiasm. 
c. It leaves the pupil with a desire to know more. 
d. It develops ideas. 
. It provides a new unit for classroom or individual 
study. 
. It is more economical; by emphasizing larger 
things, pupils learn to evaluate and classify. 
. It furnishes a criterion for determining the capa- 
city of children; and enables the teacher to recog- 
nize and meet individual needs. 
. By providing for the use of all the learning proc- 
esses, it tends toward balanced development. 
. It develops skill under conditions that tend to- 
ward habituation. 
It contributes to democracy. 
a. It gives training in codperative social service, 
including leadership and division of labor.

b. It provides for initiative. 
c. It develops foresight. 
d. It cultivates efficiency. 
e. It encourages serious and sustained thinking, 
through consideration, selection, and elimi- 
nation of material. 
f. It imposes responsibility. 
g. It exercises discriminating judgment, and 
hence, awakens appreciation of values. 
h. It makes for self-reliance, self-direction, and 
self-control. 
In the light of such claims, an open-minded at- 
titude would demand that the project method be 
recognized in our efforts toward educational prog- 
ress. 
EDUCATIONAL PRINCIPLES INVOLVED IN 
THE FOREGOING DISCUSSION 
1. The project method of teaching emphasizes purposeful 
activity in a stimulating environment which develops 
the highest social, moral, and intellectual attitude on 
the part of the pupils toward a situation closely related 
to their life interests. 
2. The pupils should have an active part in purposing, 
planning, executing, and judging or testing the work in 
which they are engaged. 
8. The teacher’s part in the work is careful consideration 
and wise participation in each of these four steps of pro- 
cedure. She must determine the quality and extent of 
her consideration and participation by the limits set by 
the definition of the project. 
4. The special teacher in any subject should codperate in 
order to bring to the whole-hearted activity of the 
pupils the professional opinions of an expert, without 
emphasizing subject-matter as an end in itself.  
-P-A-G-E-257

5. Wise experimentation has proved the project method of 
teaching to be a valuable contribution toward educa- 
tional progress, and worthy of careful study and adop- 
tion.

    CHAPTER XVI 
PROJECT TEACHING ILLUSTRATED 
Prosect teaching is no longer viewed with suspi- 
cion by many progressive teachers; but they have 
by no means exhausted the possibilities when they 
have merely made school work a little more inter- 
esting for their pupils. 
The lower grades have, perhaps, profited most 
by this progressive movement — just why, it is 
somewhat difficult to ascertain; perhaps it is be- 
cause younger pupils are more responsive. It 
may be that upper-grade pupils have been so 
restricted that they have temporarily lost the 
power of initiative. Many teachers have found 
this to be apparently true, but are not ready to 
say that upper-grade work cannot be greatly im- 
proved by centering the school activities around 
projects or purposeful acts. Sixth-grade pupils 
have undeveloped powers of initiative, and a hith- 
erto undiscovered executive ability that may be 
developed if proper stimuli are provided. 
A sixth grade centered their first semester’s 
work around European geography, motivated by 
their War interests and activities, the culmina- 
tion of which was a pageant entitled “ Rebuilding
-P-A-G-E-259
  PROJECT TEACHING ILLUSTRATED = 245 
Europe,” which was written and presented by 
the pupils. 
What could be found in the work of the second 
semester that would be so absorbingly interesting 
and so far-reaching in educational effects as the 
World War had been? This question was upper- 
most in the mind of the teacher. With it came 
the corollary: If the work of the first semester 
has been successful in developing initiative and a 
more than usual interest in school activities, will 
the pupils not be able to choose their own activi- 
ties, to propose their own projects? 
Believing that such a procedure is the surest 
test of teaching, and convinced that activity pro- 
posed by the class is far more productive of de- 
sired results than that which is superimposed by 
authority, the teacher made the work as interest- 
ing as possible and waited. If teachers could only 
learn the art of waiting, they might more often 
see real development in their pupils; providing 
that the environment is sufficiently stimulating. 
The background established. The course of 
study called for the study of Asia and Africa. At 
the beginning of the semester the nation was en- 
gaged in a drive for funds for Armenia. The in- 
terest of these pupils in the World War made it 
quite easy to become interested in this situation. 
While studying Armenia, the class became inter- 
ested in the Turks, and it was only natural that 
 
-P-A-G-E-260
  246 PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING APPLIED 
the oppression in Syria and Palestine should lead 
to a study of these countries. 
The pupils were always asked to state the prob- 
lem in which they were interested. Often these 
problems were solved as a group project, and 
sometimes as individual projects to be reported to 
the class. The problems were usually about the 
people of the various countries; for example: How 
do they dress? What kind of homes do they 
have? What are their industries? How do their 
schools compare with ours? What customs do 
they have that differ from ours? 
Before these problems could be solved the pu- 
pils outlined topics which must be known in order 
to answer them correctly. In this way they hada 
keen motive for studying location, climate, sur- 
face, government; — in fact, all the topics which 
would be considered essentials in the traditional 
type of teaching; and yet it was all done at the 
suggestion of the pupils to help them in solving a 
problem of real interest. 
The teacher’s leading question. By this time 
the pupils were interested in the Near East, and 
were ready for the question: “Why do you sup- 
pose that we have heard so much about Europe 
and so little about Asia?” Various answers were 
received, but the class was not urged to come to a 
definite decision, as the question was one on which 
the teacher wished more thought to be given.

few of the best tales from Arabian Nights. The 
pupils were encouraged to bring newspaper clip- 
pings and illustrations of any of the countries 
studied. They soon had an interesting collection 
of pictures showing the life typical of each coun- 
try. 
The main project launched. The class now de- 
cided that many people are not interested in Asia 
because they know so little about it. Since they 
always considered the Training School their near- 
est community, and were constantly encouraged 
in the sharing of pleasure and information, the 
natural question was: “What can we do to let 
the Training School know more about Asia and 
Africa?” 
By careful and sympathetic questioning and 
discussion the class decided to give an Oriental 
exhibit at the close of the semester. In order to 
make their exhibit a true representation they 
must know as much as possible about each coun- 
try. This was a beginning but was quite suffi- 
cient to motivate many lines of school activity. 
Every suggestion in regard to what they could do 
to make an interesting exhibit was evaluated by 
the class and accepted or rejected according to the 
judgment of the pupils. 
The pupils state the problems. A few of the 
problems studied are listed here. It should be

their own problems.

in the southeastern part? 
In what ways are the Asiatic people different 
from the Europeans?

. Take an imaginary trip to the Holy Land by 
means of pictures and books. 
. How does peasant life in Palestine compare with 
peasant life in Europe? 
. What is there of interest to an American tourist 
in Arabia? 
. Why is Japan the only Asiatic country that is 
considered a world power? 
. Why does Japan want to control China? 
. Imaginary trips in Africa — with Roosevelt in 
the jungles; with a caravan crossing the Sahara; 
a Boer in the Transvaal. 
What is typical of each country studied? 
How can we best represent these countries in our 
exhibit? 
Correlated activities. Desk outline maps were 
colored to emphasize locational geography in 
Asia, and a papier-mAaché relief map of Africa was 
made as a group project. These appeared in the 
exhibit. 
The new flag of China was painted by each pu- 
pil, and these made an effective border on one wall 
of the exhibit room.

A sand-table representation of a Kongo village 
was the contribution resulting from a study of 
that section of Africa. 
Composition immediately assumed a more im- 
portant place, because it was agreed that the pu- 
pils would wish to write about the various coun- 
tries. The selection of interesting subjects, and 
the securing of variety in expression were suffi- 
cient motives for much discussion and criticism, 
and to have one’s paper selected for display was a 
strong incentive for best effort. Lack of space in 
this chapter eliminates a discussion of the devel- 
opment of each composition. Some of the titles 
may, however, be suggestive. 
1. Write about the country of the Near East in 
which you have been most interested. Select a 
particular phase for discussion. 
. Tea culture in India. 
. A letter home written at Ghadames, Tripoli, after 
an imaginary trip across the Sahara Desert. 
. A newspaper article written to the home paper by 
a colonist in Belgian Kongo. 
5. The silk industry in China. Discuss one phase. 
6. Cotton culture in Egypt. 
7. Gold in South Africa. 
8. Any topic which interests you on Japan. go 2 Ct 
Chapter VII contains an account of the work 
done on Japan. In all of this work spelling ideals 
were uniformly high and perfect papers became 
the standard. The lists of words were usually 
suggested by the pupils, who recognized or an-
-P-A-G-E-264

    ticipated their own needs for effective written 
work. 
Penmanship, an especial weakness in this class, 
now received added attention, lest the exhibit 
should receive unfavorable criticism, for by this 
time it was decided that the entire Normal School 
as well as parents and friends should be invited. 
Literature correlated. The reading was varied 
and interesting, and covered almost every phase 
of that subject. Reading for information became 
a necessity, and because of the keen motivation, 
was attacked with a zest not always attendant 
upon this class of reading material. The teacher 
had anticipated the needs, and as each country 
was studied, available books from every possible 
“source were accessible on classroom shelves. Pu: 
pils were encouraged to work in the city library 
and they frequently asked for that privilege. 
There is an abundance of material on almest 
every topic of interest, but it often requires care- 
ful searching to find the rare bits possessing real 
literary value. A few suggestions will serve to 
illustrate this type of work: 
Kipling’s Just So Stories and the Jungle Books 
were enjoyed while studying India. The Pipes of 
Lucknow was also appropriate at this time. 
The Arab and His Steed, by Mrs. Norton, was 
read with appreciation during the study of Arabia; 
also Abdallah, Son of the Desert.

Blossoms from a Japanese Garden, by M. M. 
Fenollosa, furnished choice poems. 
The work on Africa was enriched by such selec- 
tions as “Elephant Hunting,” from Wild Beasts 
and Their Ways, by Sir Samuel W. Baker, and 
Lion Taming.

ander, is also good. 
Selections from the Bible for opening exercises 
received a new meaning because of our study. 
The lives of Abraham, Moses, Joseph, and Jesus 
now had the realistic geography as a background 
in the child’s mental picture. 
The art work related. No Oriental exhibit 
could be complete without much attention to the 
esthetic effect; so the art work received a new 
inspiration. After due consideration and discus- 
sion, the class decided to make cut-out colored 
poster effects typical of each country studied. 
This was another incentive for knowing the scenic 
wonders, the peculiar customs, and the native cos- 
tumes of the countries to be represented. 
The first efforts were somewhat discouraging 
from an esthetic viewpoint, but the interests and 
efforts of the pupils were all that could be desired; 
so we continued, and were pleased to see the class
-P-A-G-E-266
    252 PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING APPLIED 
growing daily more discriminating in judgment 
and more skillful in execution. 
The final results were very gratifying, and even 
a disinterested observer could recognize such sub- 
jects as “ Transportation in the Orient,” for there 
was the elephant from India, the camel in a desert 
scene, the jinrikisha, and even the babe strapped 
to his mother’s back, in the “Land of the Rising 
Sun.” 
Care was taken that each pupil should select his 
subject according to his own interests, and should 
be aided in expressing it satisfactorily. Historic 
accuracy of subject-matter, color values, propor- 
tion, perspective, skill in cutting and mounting, 
all received special attention. 
Egyptian pottery was one of the most interest- 
ing subjects studied. Pupils studied the history 
of pottery as an industry and planned a visit to 
a local pottery. The fact that the city in which 
the project was carried on ranks second in this 
great enterprise gave additional reason for em- 
phasis, and increased the interest in the modern 
phases of the industry. 
Vase forms were designed by each pupil. This 
gave practice in free cutting, originality in select- 
ing appropriate motifs and color effects, and skill 
in applying the principles of artistic arrangement. 
The pupil then moulded clay vases, applying the 
principle already learned. When these vases
-P-A-G-E-267
  PROJECT TEACHING ILLUSTRATED = 258 
were painted and shellacked, the effect was very 
pleasing. 
The general plan of the exhibit. Perhaps the 
mosi interesting feature was the assembling of all 
the work for the exhibit. This was a problem 
which must receive careful consideration. Six 
booths of uniform size were built, 72 feet high, 43 
feet wide, and 6 feet long. The entire front and 
roof of each booth was left open. Partitions and 
walls were made of strawboard to give a firm 
foundation. Light gray bogus paper was used as 
a final covering for the walls to give a soft neutral 
background for the mounted work. All of this 
material was used in full-sized sheets so that it 
could be used again. 
All art work was mounted: on dark brown, 
green, or gray; whenever possible a uniform size 
was used, 9 by 12 inches. The art work was 
placed on the wall opposite the entrance. Com- 
positions and spelling papers, all mounted on 
brown craft paper, occupied the right wall, and 
mounted pictures collected by the pupils were 
placed on the left wall. With this much uniform- 
ity in each booth it was possible to add individual 
touches without spoiling the general balance so 
necessary in a large display. 
The entire front of the six booths was orna- 
mented across the top with a facade effect. This, 
with the partition posts, was decorated. An Ori-
-P-A-G-E-268
  254 PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING APPLIED 
ental border design was worked out on squared 
paper and colored black. When the pattern was 
cut out and mounted on deep, rich red, the effect 
was truly Oriental, and was greatly enhanced by 
a fancy lantern in each booth, illuminated by an 
electric bulb. The lanterns were made of rice 
paper, each one having a design appropriate for 
a particular booth; for example, cherry blossoms 
and Fujiyama for Japan; and a dragon for China. 
The booths were arranged in the following order: 
the Near East, including Armenia, Syria, Pales- 
tine, Arabia, India, and Persia; China; Japan; 
and a double-sized booth for Africa. 
Industrial arts represented. Besides the work 
already described there were several industrial 
charts, including silk charts in the Chinese booth, 
and cotton and gold charts in the African booth. 
Since the silk chart is typical of the general idea 
of all, a brief description may be helpful. During 
the study of the silk industry pupils were en- 
couraged to bring samples of silk materials, that 
design might be studied; illustrations of the vari- 
ous stages of silkworm raising and manufacture of 
silk; and pictures of articles made from silk. The 
selection, arranging, and mounting of this mate- 
rial gave practice in the principles of art involved. 
The best list of articles made from silk, written by 
a pupil, was also placed on these charts. 
There were many choice articles contributed by
-P-A-G-E-269
  ‘ PROJECT TEACHING ILLUSTRATED = 255 
pupils or friends which gave a realistic effect to 
each booth. Among these were a poster, written 
in Chinese and then in English by a local Chinese 
man; a Japanese game; Japanese pottery; a silk 
shaw] from India; pottery, a silk scarf and novel- 
ties from China; and a collection of African 
stamps. Children, costumed to represent the 
natives from each country, greeted the visitors 
and completed the Oriental picture. 
There is a feeling among some school authori- 
ties that project teaching will of necessity elimi- 
nate some of the school subjects, or cause them to 
be neglected. Perhaps an account of how this sit- 
uation was provided for may help an eager, but 
doubting, teacher. 
If project teaching means assisting pupils in the 
pursuit of purposeful activity, then more than one 
project can be pursued during any one semester. 
In the situation here described, when the interest 
became increasingly evident in the exhibit, it was 
suggested that we show other activities of the 
school work besides that which was directly con- 
nected with the study of the Orient. 
Nature study and hygiene represented. 
~ 1. A flower chart, recording name, color, date, and 
name of pupil bringing to school the first specimen. 
2. Illustrations in water-color of spring flowers — 
pussy-willow, jonquil, tulip, iris, etc.

name of pupil first reporting sight of bird.

. Asecond bird chart, classifying the common birds 
according to size and color. 
. Birdhouses made by boys of the class. 
. Charts illustrating flower and vegetable garden- 
ing by means of pictures collected by pupils. 
. Charts illustrating health habits, including oral 
hygiene, cleanliness, exercise, sleep with ventila- 
tion, etc. 
. Chart showing weekly record of hygiene habits of 
each pupil. A credit mark given for clean hands, 
face, nails, teeth, abstinence from coffee, and 
tea. 
. Weight chart, a record of each pupil’s weight each 
month compared with the normal weight accord- 
ing to age and height as computed by the United 
States Health Board. 
  Domestic science and arts. Two adjoining 
rooms were appropriated in which to display the 
sewing and cooking of the sixth-grade girls. The 
sewing included aprons, dresses, Red Cross work, 
and other garments which each of the best sewers 
had made for herself. 
The second room represented a breakfast room, 
with a simple meal prepared and served without a 
maid. Here a family of six was impersonated by 
members of the class, and excited much interest 
as they partook of the meal. The pupils were re- 
sponsible for the arrangement of the room, for the 
cooking, and for the setting of the table. 
Arithmetic represented. As an arithmetic pro- 
ject the pupils had been much interested in the 
imaginary furnishing of a house. Both boys and
-P-A-G-E-271
  PROJECT TEACHING ILLUSTRATED = 257 
girls had made booklets in which illustrations of 
furniture for each of four rooms were mounted. 
The solution of problems which arose in connec- 
tion with the project were mounted in the book, 
and also lists of spelling words, which were neces- 
sary in making orders, writing bills, and receipts. 
These booklets were displayed on tables provided 
in the exhibit room, as were also plans for a base- 
ball diamond and tennis court, which motivated 
learning to draw to a scale. 
The teaching of percentage was motivated by 
each pupil keeping his own daily record in the 
Studebaker Practice Tests, which the pupils en- 
joyed as a daily drill in arithmetic. The weekly 
average was computed and each pupil made a 
graph showing his weekly progress. A class 
graph was also made by each pupil so that he was 
able to picture vividly his own rating as compared 
with the class. These graphs increased the inter- 
est in arithmetic and made an interesting showing 
at the exhibit. 
As the result of much experimentation it is the 
opinion of the writer that teaching by means of 
real interest in a project, which is educationally 
worth while, is not a fad, but a real progress in 
meaningful education, worthy of being tried by 
those who are deeply interested in child welfare.

EDUCATIONAL PRINCIPLES INVOLVED IN 
THE FOREGOING DISCUSSION 
. Pupils have the power of initiative which should be de- 
veloped by purposing their own activities. 
. If the situation is sufficiently stimulating, pupils will 
suggest projects in which they wish to participate. Eval- 
uating such suggestions is in itself valuable experience. 
. Projects may vary in scope and in the time necessary 
for their completion. The most educative projects are 
those which suggest numerous other possible projects 
and problems for solution. 
. Those projects are of greatest value which permit a cor- 
relation of many subjects, thus relating the pupil’s fund 
of knowledge in a natural situation. 
. More than one project may be carried on at a given 
time without interfering with the pupil’s advancement. 
Caution should be observed that pupils are not encour- 
aged in beginning so many lines of activity that all can- 
not be finished satisfactorily. 
. If a pupil begins a project and finds that its completion 
is not necessary, he should be permitted to abandon it 
for something which to him seems more valuable, if he 
can show good reason for his decision. 
PROBLEMS FOR INVESTIGATION AND 
DISCUSSION 
. Show by an illustration how working on a project stim- 
ulates vigorous thinking. 
. Why is the project method of teaching more interesting 
to the pupils than the traditional methods? Why is it 
more interesting to the teacher? 
. Tell how you would encourage pupil activity without 
having disorder. What would you consider disorder? 
. Discuss drill as it should be used in project teaching. 
. What qualifications should a teacher possess in order 
to excel in the use of the project method? Would the 
same qualifications contribute to better teaching if any 
other method were used?

  CHAPTER XVII 
SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 
Very often a teacher is heard to remark: “If I 
could only manage my room as well as Miss A. 
does hers, teaching would be a pleasure.” 
The success of teachers like Miss A. is often due 
to attention to mechanical details, in which every 
teacher could improve by thoughtful study and 
careful planning. 
There are three elements which must receive 
attention if school management is to be consid- 
ered a success: management of the room, man- 
agement of the class, and economy of time in all 
procedure. 
Management of the room. Every teacher 
should realize her responsibility in determining 
the environment in which her pupils spend so 
large a part of their time. While many features 
of building control are not within the teacher’s 
power to manage, yet it is possible for every 
teacher to use her influence in securing the codper- 
ation of the principal, the janitor, and the pupils, 
themselves, to obtain better sanitary conditions. 
The teachers of an eight-room building were 
asked to record the temperature of the room each 
hour, on a card provided for the purpose by the
-P-A-G-E-275
  * 
SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 261 
superintendent. The third-grade teacher com- 
plainingly said: “I might just as well try to be a 
nurse and try to teach with the idea on my mind 
all the time that I must stop each hour at a cer- 
tain time and give a dose of medicine.” 
By assuming such an attitude this teacher 
failed to codperate in a movement which was 
meant to secure better heating facilities, better 
janitor service, and consequently better working 
conditions for herself and her pupils. Her reply 
is typical of the attitude of many teachers who 
like to teach, but fail to recognize the importance 
of attention to the improvement of working condi- 
tions in the room. Fortunately such an attitude 
in the teaching profession is becoming more and 
more unusual, as teachers are realizing that their 
work is composed of a much wider scope than 
drilling on “‘ the three R’s.” 
Sanitation. Neither teacher nor pupils can 
do highly efficient work in a room that is poorly 
heated, ventilated, or lighted. Janitors do not 
always realize the importance of fresh air, clean 
windows, and even temperature; therefore, it is 
the teacher’s duty to assume responsibility in 
these details. 
Such matters should be so systematized that 
they will not interfere with the classroom work. 
It is good training for the older pupils to be ap- 
pointed to take turns in looking after the physical
-P-A-G-E-276
  262 PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING APPLIED 
conditions of the room, such as recording the tem- 
perature at stated times throughout the day, low- 
ering windows to admit fresh air without causing 
a draft, or raising windows at recess time to flush 
the room with fresh air. Attention to these needs 
should be considered a part of the hygiene in- 
struction, and committees may be appointed and 
should report at the regular hygiene recitation 
time. 
Neatness. It is not inappropriate to have the 
committee on hygiene look after the neatness of 
the room. In many schools the janitor’s work is 
too heavy to expect that the blackboards will be 
washed. Pupils usually enjoy helping to care for 
the neatness of the room, especially if the teacher 
gives her attention to their efforts. 
There are occasionally pupils who should not be 
subjected to chalk dust, therefore teachers should 
be careful to permit only those pupils to help who 
are physically able and whose home work does 
not make a too heavy demand upon their leisure 
time. 
Each teacher should study her own room to as- 
- certain just what items need daily attention. In 
so far as possible the pupils’ help should be en- 
listed; but the management must eventually rest 
upon the teacher, since all pupil activities must be 
supervised. 
Clean blackboards with neatly written assign-
-P-A-G-E-277
  
SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 263 
ments, clean chalk ledges and erasers, a few ap- 
propriate pictures, artistically framed and hung, 
her own desk attractively clean and neat, growing 
plants and cut flowers arranged in artistic pottery 
and vases, are all items which must be given at- 
tention if a teacher would provide a sanitary and 
attractive environment for her pupils. 
A superintendent once said that in entering a 
room to select a teacher for a prospective position 
he usually noticed the window shades, believing 
that neglect of this important matter was indica- 
tive of a general inaptitude for essential and or- 
derly details. 
While the teacher may feel that such judgment 
should be meted with discretion, yet she must ad- 
mit that evenly adjusted window shades add ma- 
terially to the attractiveness of a room. 
The teacher who refused to make a necessary 
adjustment of a shade in order to shut out the di- 
rect sunlight from a pupil’s desk was carrying the 
idea of neatness too far, as were also the one who 
kept all shades drawn exactly one half of the way 
down on a dark day, and the one who would per- 
mit no child to approach her desk for fear that its 
neatness should be disturbed. 
Only common sense can enable the teacher to 
determine relative values in the affairs of room 
management as in all other school affairs. The 
important consideration is that the teacher should  
-P-A-G-E-278
264 PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING APPLIED 
have correct standards in hygiene and neatness, 
and that she recognize her responsibility in these 
elements of efficient school work. 
Routine affairs. There are certain routine af- 
fairs which must receive daily attention if the 
organization of the school is to be conducive to 
good work. The best teacher is the one who has 
given definite attention to such matters early in 
the term, until pupils understand that they are a 
necessary requisite of successful procedure, and 
then both teacher and pupils can devote their 
concentrated attention to the immediate needs of 
each recitation. 
Since ideal conformance to established pro- 
cedure cannot be expected of children whose hab- 
its are not yet formed, the teacher should recog- 
nize the importance of frequent suggestions and 
adjustments, that desired standards may be kept 
in mind. 
There is a danger to be avoided — that of too 
much organization; pupils may become too de- 
pendent upon the required routine until school 
work assumes the lockstep, and initiative is 
crushed. For this reason the teacher must lead 
pupils to discriminate carefully as to what activ- 
ities may be best accomplished by routine pro- 
cedure. 
An illustration of routine management. A 
sixth grade had a weekly period for the appoint- 
 
-P-A-G-E-279
  
SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 265 
ment of various committees, which were to assume 
definite responsibilities for the following week. 
The civics committee secured playground equip- 
ment from the general lockers and directed the 
playground games; the house committee attended 
to the cleaning of blackboards and inspected pu- 
pils’ desks and floor space to see that the room 
was always in order; the flower committee wa- 
tered and arranged the flowers; the hygiene com- 
mittee inspected pupils to encourage personal 
neatness and cleanliness; the teacher’s “assist- 
ant” had charge of a special table on which sup- 
plementary materials and supplies were kept in 
order as needed. 
While such an organization requires time to 
make it function, it is a fine opportunity for 
teacher and pupils to work together in a natural 
manner for the accomplishment of a desirable 
purpose, while it furnishes training in the es- 
sentials of good citizenship. 
Seating of pupils. No definite rules, that can 
apply to all situations, can be established in re- 
gard to the best seating arrangement for pupils. 
Some teachers prefer to have alternate rows of 
girls and boys to facilitate passing for wraps; 
others arrange all rows according to size with the 
smaller pupils in the front seats; while still others 
require the troublesome pupil to sit in the front 
seat, where he can be more easily watched.
-P-A-G-E-280
    266 PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING APPLIED 
While there is some justification in each of 
these methods, there are other more important 
considerations. The pupil whose vision or whose 
hearing is defective should be given an advan- 
tageous position in the front of the room, where 
the work on the blackboard can be easily seen, 
and where the teacher’s directions and the pupils’ 
discussions can be heard. 
It is often advisable to place the troublesome 
pupil in the rear of the room, where his antics may 
not be so readily observed by the other pupils. 
Providing interesting seat work in abundance 
may eliminate this problem of the troublesome 
pupil. 
The teacher should also consider the timid pu- 
pil; to occupy a front seat may relieve the nerv- 
ousness of such a pupil and enable him to acquire 
confidence through nearness to the teacher. Such 
timidity should not be encouraged, but should be 
sympathetically dealt with until time enables the 
pupil to overcome the tendency. The teacher 
will do well to move about the room so that all 
pupils may feel that they have an equal chance 
for this much-coveted nearness to the teacher. 
Many teachers make the mistake of making 
themselves so necessary to the pupils that suc- 
cessful procedure depends upon their dominant 
personality. Popularity which develops such de- 
pendence is not complimentary to the teacher’s
-P-A-G-E-281
  SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 267 
ability, since it is not best for the child’s growth. 
Pupils should become increasingly capable of 
carrying on a recitation without the teacher’s 
direct control. This does not imply that the 
teacher’s guidance is to be dispensed with; rather 
that her guidance should be of a profitable kind. 
Economy of time. The teacher often becomes 
overwhelmed by the duties required without 
stopping to analyze her procedure for the pur- 
pose of improving her methods of work. As has 
already been suggested, economy of fime can be 
secured by mechanizing routine affairs. 
Much confusion can be avoided and much time 
saved by a systematic method of collecting and 
distributing materials. Various methods may be 
successfully employed; the important elements to 
be considered are economy of time and a maxi- 
mum of pupil responsibility. There is no reason 
why the two elements may not be achieved at 
the same time. 
One teacher prefers to distribute materials, 
such as theme papers, to the pupils in the front 
seats. At a given signal each pupil takes one 
paper and passes the remainder over his shoulder, 
without turning around, to the pupil, who sits in 
the next seat in the rear. Sometimes the method 
is varied by distributing the materials to the out- 
side row and having them passed across the aisles. 
Another teacher prefers to have the monitors
-P-A-G-E-282
    268 PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING APPLIED 
stand, receive the materials, and pass down the 
aisle, giving one to each pupil. This method is 
varied by changing the monitors from time to 
time. Each teacher should plan this detail to suit 
her own needs, with emphasis upon economy of 
time and a minimum of confusion. 
A second means of economizing time is in the 
passing of lines. Here again the pupil’s respon- 
sibility must be considered. Economy of time 
must be considered, but pupil initiative need not 
suffer thereby. To have pupils lock hands be- 
hind the back and proceed to the drinking foun- 
tain in lockstep fashion may look systematic, 
but it violates two principles which are of extreme 
importance; namely, the value of a hygienic walk- 
ing position, and self-control. 
Much energy is wasted by teachers and pupils 
by requiring a rigid conformance to the “rules” 
while inline. True, in the passing of several hun- 
dred children there should be some system. Good 
order demands that as little confusion as possible 
occur, but well-regulated schools have found that 
passing in line is not any “better order” than 
passing in a more independent manner. 
The woeful conduct of some school children in 
public places, where they feel relieved from the 
restraining influence of authority, and the admir- 
able behavior of others under the same condi- 
tions, would indicate that the schools can do some-
-P-A-G-E-283
  
  SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 269 
thing to contribute to greater improvement along 
this line. 
The principal of a large city school visited the 
supervisor’s office, and asked for suggestions as to 
how she could improve her school. No school in 
the city at the time had more beautiful “‘order” 
at dismissals. The pupils kept in step to music, 
turned square corners, refrained from talking, . 
and observed every detail of the “rules” of 
marching. 
The supervisor’s suggestion was somewhat of a 
shock, therefore, when she said: “Try ‘free’ dis- 
missals for a while, and report how you like it.” 
She then outlined the dangers of the system 
which had come to be somewhat of a fetish, and 
was so mechanical that it was being felt in other 
lines of school procedure: (1) Marching to music 
should be a pleasure; when accompanied by rigid 
discipline it ceases to be a pleasure; (2) keeping 
the line results in nerve strain on the part of the 
teacher rather than self-control on the part of the 
pupils; (3) the pupils should learn to use the same 
judgment and self-reliance in leaving a school 
building that will be needed when leaving any 
other public building. 
The principal felt reluctant in giving up the 
cherished plans as they had been practiced for 
many years, but decided to follow the sugges- 
_ tions offered by the supervisor. The pupils were
-P-A-G-E-284
  270 PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING APPLIED 
called to a general assembly where plans for the 
“free” dismissal were discussed. They liked the 
plan, and agreed that good order would demand 
that there should be no confusion in passing. It 
was decided that they should pass out from the 
building as individuals whenever it was con- 
venient to do so without disorder and without 
crowding the halls and stairways. 
The plan was a success, both principals and 
teachers reported a relief that had not been felt 
under the former scheme of rigid conformance to 
a set rule. The building was emptied in five 
minutes’ less time, teachers were relieved of the 
strain of having every pupil in step and in line, 
pupils felt the joy of added responsibility and 
self-respect, and the marching to music was done 
at a regular period once a week for real pleasure. 
Economy in the class recitation. Much time 
could be saved in the class recitation by a better 
organization of the thought processes of teacher 
and pupils. More attention to careful planning 
and more discrimination in analyzing her own 
procedure will aid the teacher in organizing her 
own work, and in assisting her pupils to greater 
economy in this respect. 
Another item which deserves special attention 
in any program for economy is avoiding unneces- 
sary and indistinct talk by teacher and pupils. If 
economy of time in this respect is set up as a
-P-A-G-E-285
SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 271 
  standard much can be accomplished toward defi- 
nite improvement. 
Pupils should be taught that loudness of tone is 
not desirable; rather clear articulation and con- 
cise enunciation with a pleasing quality of voice 
should be encouraged. 
A third means of economizing time in the class 
recitation is by the selection of appropriate devices. 
A device which is applicable to the immediate 
situation will often illustrate a difficult point 
better than a lengthy explanation. The device 
should be carefully selected, adequately planned, 
and used as a means of economy in the learning 
process, not as an end in itself. 
Management of the class. Having given ade- 
quate attention to the mechanical details of the 
room management, including particular attention 
to the problem of economy of time, the teacher 
then has freedom to consider the items which are 
involved in the management of the class. 
Securing codperation. Unless the teacher is 
expecting to promote autocracy she will seek first 
to secure the codperation of the pupils. She will 
recognize that education is not a “pouring-in” 
process in which the pupil’s mind is an empty re- 
ceptacle to be filled by the teacher’s words; rather, 
that education is a leading-out into new methods, 
relations, responsibilities, and opportunities. 
Judgment in using authority. There should 
 
-P-A-G-E-286
  272 PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING APPLIED 
never be a doubt in the pupil’s mind that the 
teacher has authority. Respect for authority is a 
necessary requisite of any well-founded society. 
This authority need not imply the right to ad- 
minister corporal punishment. It should rather 
imply that because of age and experience the 
teacher has a superior knowledge and judgment 
which entitles her to genuine respect and obedi- 
ence. 
There is much discussion in the present day of 
the relative value of the old method of discipline © 
based upon the adage, “‘spare the rod and spoil 
the child,” and the modern tendency to require 
no submission to authority. 
_ In the writer’s estimation there need be no 
rigid adherence to either course; in fact, the point 
at issue should not be, “Shall the child be cor- 
porally punished or shall he be allowed to do as 
he pleases?” To admit that teacher authority is 
based upon either alternative is to refute the pro- * 
gress made through all the years of child study. 
Importance of definite ideals. The teacher 
must first have definite ideals of conduct; not 
merely those extremes of moral conduct such as 
refraining from swearing, stealing, lying, and the 
like, which form the foundation of polite society; 
but also ideals of conduct in the usual school 
activities. 
Her next procedure should be to lead her pu-
-P-A-G-E-287
SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 978 
pils to establish high ideals of conduct. These 
ideals should range all the way from honesty in 
preparing one’s lesson to consideration for the 
neighbor at the drinking fountain. 
In aschool where consideration for others is the 
ideal, the teacher’s authority need not often be 
tested; but when occasion arises when authority is 
needed, she should leave no mistaken idea in the 
pupil’s mind as to the rights of the society over 
which she is the recognized leader. 
When the teacher possesses this desirable qual- 
ity of judgment in using authority, the pupils 
learn to recognize the atmosphere and adapt 
themselves accordingly. 
To a fifth-grade class which had established 
high ideals of conduct there came a boy whose 
mother admitted that she “could do nothing with 
him.” His reaction after three days in the room 
was: “Aw, Gee! Mother, it’s no use to try to have 
any fun in that room; nobody pays any attention 
to it.” Ina short time he was getting his fun in 
an entirely different fashion, which he found con- 
formed to the ideals of the class, and incidentally 
increased his own self-respect. 
Appropriate methods. The teacher should be 
able to justify her procedure in the light of psy- 
chological and ethical principles. For a pupil 
to be asked to comply with a teacher’s request 
merely to please the teacher is not a firm basis  
-P-A-G-E-288
  
  274 PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING APPLIED 
upon which to build the framework of a strong 
moral character. 
While the pupil should not be expected to rec- 
ognize the principles with the same degree of un- 
derstanding as that possessed by the teacher, yet 
he may, and should, be led to appreciate the 
significance of the situation from a child’s view- 
point. 
The teacher should always keep in mind the 
purpose of any disciplinary measure — the high- 
est welfare of the individual and of the group. 
With this purpose in mind she is in no danger of 
letting the personal element enter into her show 
of authority. 
A seventh-grade teacher, exasperated by the 
mischievous attitude of an unemployed boy, ap- 
proached his desk with head erect, flashing eyes, 
and in a high-pitched voice demanded: “Do you 
know who I am?” 
If the boy had been more mature in his ability 
to analyze and honest in his statement instead 
of politely silent, he might have said: ‘“‘ You are 
a most ridiculous specimen of a woman, who is 
showing a fit of temper instead of the poise of 
authority.” 
As it was, he enjoyed the situation, lost his re- 
spect for the teacher, and awaited only another 
opportunity to call forth a similar display of 
temper.
-P-A-G-E-289
  
SCHOOL MANAGEMENT 275 
A teacher should never forget that a show of 
personal animosity has no place in the schoolroom. 
She should endeavor to keep herself in good physi- 
cal condition where nervousness is not a handicap; 
and last, but not least, she should have a genuine 
respect for the rights and privileges of childhood, 
with a patience born of intimate understanding of 
its methods of growth. 
EDUCATIONAL PRINCIPLES INVOLVED IN 
THE FOREGOING DISCUSSION 
. The teacher should codperate in every reasonable way 
to secure a sanitary and attractive environment for her 
pupils, that their ideals may be influenced by actual 
contact with the best surroundings. 
. Attention to routine management at the appropriate 
time will release the mind of the teacher for the main 
duties of teaching. 
. Individual differences and pupil responsibility should 
receive consideration in the planning of all room man- 
agement as well as in class procedure. 
. Economy of time may be secured by (a) a systematic 
method of collecting and distributing materials, (b) a 
shifting of responsibility from teacher to pupils in the 
passing of lines, (c) a better organization of the thought 
processes of teacher and pupils, (d) avoiding unnec- 
essary and indistinct talk in the classroom, and by (e) 
the selection of appropriate devices. 
. In the management of the class the teacher should seek 
to secure the codperation of the pupils, should use judg- 
ment in showing authority, and should emphasize the 
importance of definite ideals of conduct. 
. The teacher should have always in mind an apprecia- 
tion of her responsibility as a leader of youth, whose 
ideals are largely fashioned by her example.

PROBLEMS FOR INVESTIGATION AND 
DISCUSSION 
1. To what extent is a teacher’s character and example an 
aid in school management? 
2. What can a teacher do to secure the use of a pleasing, 
conversational tone of voice by her pupils during school 
procedure? How important is this phase of school 
work? , 
8. Name five cases of corporal punishment and tell of ef- 
fective substitutes which would be in keeping with 
sound educational principles. 
4. How important is seat adjustment to the growing pupil? 
State how you would secure proper seating for pupils 
who differed in size. 
5. Describe three devices which you have observed or used, 
and justify their use in the light of the discussion in the 
preceding chapter.

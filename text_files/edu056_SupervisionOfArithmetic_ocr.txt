PREFACE 
Tuts is not a teacher’s handbook for the teaching 
of arithmetic ; it does not contain a detailed description 
of the methods and devices teachers should employ in 
teaching arithmetic, nor is it intended to be in any 
sense a critical analysis of the many scholarly articles 
that have appeared within recent years bearing upon 
the subject. It is frankly the result of a number of 
surveys and investigations conducted by the authors 
themselves or their students of certain problems relat- 
ing to the supervision of arithmetic. It is not main- 
‘tained that every problem relating to the supervision 
of arithmetic has been solved. 
This book gives the inquiring and progressive super- 
visor certain criteria for judging his course of study in 
arithmetic and in addition it gives him certain tests for 
measuring the attainments of his pupils. Certainly its 
greatest value lies in the fact that it raises to con- 
sciousness and outlines more clearly than heretofore 
a number of problems connected with the supervision 
of arithmetic.

THE. SUPERVISION: OF 
ARITHMETIC 
CHAPTER I 
SUBJECT MATTER OF ARITHMETIC 
CuRRENT CRITICISMS 
Most critics of the public schools are inclined to main- 
tain the thesis that the work in arithmetic of to-day is 
less satisfactory than the work which was done in this 
subject at an earlier period. They say that the old- 
fashioned teacher spent more time in drill, and less time 
in rationalization or explanation. The critic of to-day 
is disposed to call attention to the fact that certain fac- 
tors and processes which are being taught in arithmetic: 
are of questionable value as far as the practical demands 
of the day are concerned. The usual illustrations cited 
are: tables— furlongs, apothecaries’ weights, foreign 
money, folding paper, longitude and time, and the like. 
Much criticism is also heard against the teaching of 
true discount, cube root, partnership, unreal fractions, 
and alligation.

2, THE SUPERVISION OF ARITHMETIC 
Again, it is not infrequently stated that more atten- 
tion should be given both in the fundamentals and in 
the applications of arithmetic to social conditions con- 
nected with the problems of saving, banking, borrowing, 
building and loans, investments, bonds and stocks, taxes, 
levies, public expenditures, and insurance. 
Both of these criticisms contain certain elements of 
validity. Not only is it difficult for the school to dis- 
criminate between the essential elements of the experi- 
ence of the past, but it has no well-defined standards for 
discriminating values of the present. The immatur- 
ity, lack of experience, and inadequacy of training of 
teachers have resulted in a more or less slavish depend- 
ence upon the textbook. Indeed, in many instances 
the textbook serves as the entire course of study, and 
furnishes the only criterion of method. 
The expense of changing textbooks and the difficulties 
attending their adoption have contributed to a certain 
amount of conservatism and inflexibility in their use. 
Again, the teacher’s immaturity and lack of experience 
have tended toward the exclusive use of the problems 
and examples found in the textbook. In other words, 
there has been too little disposition on the part of 
teachers to supplement intelligently and to make con- 
crete the prescribed material of the textbook. The 
result of these tendencies is that the material has 
been more or less formal and artificial,
-P-A-G-E-11
    
SUBJECT MATTER OF ARITHMETIC 3 
CHANGING CONCEPTIONS OF ARITHMETICAL VALUES 
Despite the fact that men and women are to-day 
investing in stocks, bonds, insurance, buildings, and 
loans, the school tends to give but slight attention to 
these forms of applied arithmetic, but clings to those 
applications of arithmetic which relate to older forms of 
investment, such as surveying, the buying and selling 
of land and other tangible property such as houses and 
stores. Although it is not infrequently stated by school 
teachers that stocks, bonds, and insurance should not 
be taught, there is, on the contrary, much evidence to 
indicate that we should spend much more time in pre- 
senting these phases of arithmetic than we have hereto- 
fore expended. However, if we expect pupils to profit 
by the school’s attempts to teach these new fields, it 
is necessary that they be taught by teachers who 
thoroughly understand these forms of quantitative 
experience. 
Other forms of mathematical experience with which 
pupils should be familiarized are public expenditures, 
tax levies, and assessments. It is imperative that the 
good citizen of the future understand fully the arith- 
metic involved in the assessment and levying of taxes, 
the issuance of public bonds, and public expenditures. 
Many of the so-called “practical” courses which have 
been introduced in recent years have failed to emphasize 
 
-P-A-G-E-12
4 THE SUPERVISION OF ARITHMETIC 
the quantitative relationships of our social and economic 
life. Consequently children have been fed stereotyped 
problems. The child who studies arithmetic at the 
present time has a right to be familiarized with the 
quantitative problems of the day. The failure of many 
teachers to understand clearly the arithmetical applica- 
tions in the various fields of social activity has been 
responsible for much of the criticism directed at the 
product of our schools by business men. Teachers 
of arithmetic have been satisfied to have the children 
“work the problems” in the book. The children have 
been satisfied to find the “answers.” Neither teachers 
nor pupils have been forced to go to the bottom of the 
subject in such a way as to understand the issues in- 
volved. 
Recently an editorial writer of one of the leading 
American periodicals made the statement that arith- 
metic properly taught would make it impossible to 
exploit wild-cat mining schemes promising to pay fabu- 
lous returns. The writer said further that proper 
arithmetic teaching should include a thorough discussion 
and interpretation of sound business principles. 
Two PHAses or ARITHMETIC : 
Experimental researches in modern educational psy- 
chology have tended to divide arithmetic into two well- 
defined fields: one, that of drill wherein a child is
-P-A-G-E-13
  
  SUBJECT MATTER OF ARITHMETIC 5 
taught to add, subtract, multiply, and divide skillfully 
whole numbers and fractions; the other, wherein a 
child is taught to appreciate arithmetical situations, to 
realize differences in value, and to understand the prin- 
ciples operative in business to-day. A clearer recog- 
nition of this differentiation would mean an increased 
emphasis on the drill operations of arithmetic, as well 
as a clear-cut descriptive treatment of the broader ap- 
plications of these habits of arithmetical procedure in 
concrete social and economic situations. 
That there is a demand for greater skill on the part 
of children in ability to add, subtract, multiply, and 
divide is indubitably true. There is a demand for 
greater accuracy and speed. The supervisor will find 
it worth while to devise plans for an increased expendi- 
ture of energy on the part of the teacher in this direc- 
tion. We may, no doubt, expect to see an increased 
amount of carefully directed drill work in connection 
with this phase of arithmetic. 
On the other hand much of that part of the subject 
matter of arithmetic which is taught for the sake of 
giving the child an opportunity to understand arith- 
metical relationships in public and private life should 
be treated by detailed discussions setting forth the 
factors involved. There should be whole recitation 
periods during which attention should be focused en- 
tirely upon a discussion of material of an explanatory 
 
-P-A-G-E-14
  6 THE SUPERVISION OF ARITHMETIC 
character, and upon a critical analysis of those social 
relationships which involve arithmetic. For example, 
a teacher might spend several days in teaching the 
issues involved in life insurance, in taxation, or in pub- 
lic school expenditures. 
THE SUPERVISORY PROBLEM 
If the results indicated in the foregoing discussion are 
to be attained, it will be necessary for the supervisor to 
assure himself that his teachers are actually familiar 
with the issues involved in the formation of arithmetical 
habits on the one hand, and with the underlying mathe- 
matical principles involved in the interpretation of busi- 
ness situations on the other. 
While it is true that it is a more or less difficult thing 
to do, yet it is by no means impossible for the super- 
visor to develop an inquiring type of mind on the part 
of teachers, which will result in an understanding of the 
principles involved in social and economic arithmetical 
situations. Many commercial teachers visit commer- 
cial institutions and, indeed, not a few seek employ- 
ment in such institutions in order to gain a first-hand 
knowledge of the commercial practices involved. While 
it is not recommended that classroom teachers resign 
for the purpose of familiarizing themselves with the 
commercial phase of arithmetic, it is urged that they 
take the steps necessary to secure this knowledge.
-P-A-G-E-15
  
SUBJECT MATTER OF ARITHMETIC 7 
Teachers might profitably interview bankers, insurance 
solicitors, public accountants, and brokers. Now and 
then supervisors might profitably assemble the teachers 
of arithmetic fora frank consideration of such im- 
portant aspects of the subject. 
Textbook writers might wisely devote more atten- 
tion to these matters. At the present time many of the 
textbooks afford very meager descriptive material deal- 
ing with such activities and processes. It should be 
said, however, that there is already a tendency on the 
part of textbook writers to give more attention to 
these phases of the subject, and it is to be hoped that 
the present tendencies will be accentuated. It should 
be borne in mind, however, that this will not relieve the 
supervisor of the responsibility of utilizing every rational 
agency for making his teachers conscious of the funda- 
mental character of this problem. Nor will the text- 
book relieve the teacher of the same necessity of draw- 
ing as much of this material as possible from outside 
activities. 
The studies in elimination and retardation which 
have been carried on in recent years reveal the fact 
that a large proportion of pupils do not complete the 
elementary school course. In view of this condition it 
is of. great importance that they be taught the arith- 
metical applications to social situations in an elemen- 
tary way as early as possible in their school career.
-P-A-G-E-16
  
  8 THE SUPERVISION OF ARITHMETIC 
It is certainly unwise to postpone all such instruction 
until the eighth grade. 
ATTITUDE OF SUPERINTENDENTS 
In order to ascertain something of the attitude of 
city superintendents toward the elimination of certain 
questionable subject matter and the introduction of 
certain other new subject matter, a questionnaire’ was 
sent by the authors to seventeen hundred superin- 
tendents. Replies returned from more than eight 
hundred city superintendents indicate that, at the 
present time, there is a well-defined disposition to- 
ward the elimination of certain more or less obsolete 
material. This attitude is expressed quite clearly in 
Table I. 
The meaning of this table becomes clear when read 
thus :— 72 per cent of the superintendents in cities of 
100,000 and over favor the elimination of apothecaries’ 
weight ; 75 per cent favor the elimination of troy weight ; 
53 per cent of the superintendents in all cities favor 
the elimination of apothecaries’ weight; and 42 per 
cent favor the elimination of troy weight. 
1 This investigation was made in connection with a report for the 
Committee of Economy of Time of the National Education Association. 
Parts of this material were published in the Proceedings of the N. E. A., 
the Elementary School Teacher, and the Fourteenth Year Book of the 
National Society for the Study of Education.

It should be borne 
in mind, however, the per

in interpreting this chart, that it is possible that 
those superintendents who are satisfied with the pres- 
ent degree of emphasis may have already decreased 
the amount of attention given to the various topics in 
their own schools; likewise, it is clear that the use of 
the word “less” in this particular is a relative matter; 
 
-P-A-G-E-19

we do not know what “less than’ means. The re- 
sponse, however, is such as to convince a student 
that the superintendents of this country are not in favor 
of paying much attention to these topics.

SUBJECT MATTER OF ARITHMETIC 13 
No doubt there are other subjects which might be added 
to this list. This does not necessarily mean that these 
topics should be left out absolutely. It does mean, 
however, that instruction in these fields might properly 
be minimized in the arithmetic of the elementary 
grades. Longitude and time, for ordinary purposes, 
might be very properly taught in connection with the 
general topic of railroading, wherein the different kinds 
of time might be explained in a purely descriptive way, 
so as to enable the children to understand the facts in 
connection with standard time throughout the different 
divisions of the United States. Partnership might be 
taught more profitably under the general head of Cor- 
porations in connection with the issuance of stocks and 
bonds. For the most part, however, little time should 
be given to the topics listed above. The fact that 
superintendents throughout the country are dissatisfied 
with conditions as they exist to-day should encourage 
us to believe that we are about to change our practice 
with regard to these topics. 
Since a large proportion of the pupils do not com- 
plete the elementary school course, it is necessary that the 
school take cognizance of this so as to guarantee that 
the normal child who leaves school at an early age be 
proficient in the manipulation of the fundamentals of 
arithmetical procedure. To do this, serious attention 
should be given to the problem of teaching the funda- 
mental processes effectively.

SUBJECT MATTER OF ARITHMETIC I5 
In view of the theoretical advantage of increasing 
the emphasis upon these subjects and because it corre- 
sponds with the experience of the superintendents of 
this country, it is recommended that additional em- 
phasis be placed upon the following subject matter in

and bonds. Additional subjects might be added to this 
list, and no doubt will be added from time to time. This 
does not mean that the school should give necessarily the 
same amount of time to all these subjects. It is moreover 
conceded that certain of the subjects might be properly 
united. For instance, public expenditures, public utilities,
-P-A-G-E-24
  
16 THE SUPERVISION OF ARITHMETIC 
_taxes and levies might be handled all under one head, such 
as public finances. The important point, however, is 
that children should be taught to understand the issues in- 
volved in the expenditure of public money, the purchase 
of public utilities, and the levying of taxes. Since the 
school is to train public officials and the tax payers of 
the future, it is important that an increased amount of 
attention be given to such topics as these. Saving 
money might be handled in connection with banking, 
building and loans, insurance, or in connection with 
problems of economical purchasing or expenditures. 
The point of vital importance is that children under- 
stand the conditions involved in these various activities. 
It should be noted that the conditions under which 
children are taught addition, multiplication, subtrac- 
tion, and division are different from those under. which 
they are taught the arithmetical applications. The 
method in the one is that of intelligent drill; the method 
in the other is that of intelligent appreciation, detailed 
description, definite clearing up of points. 
Van Hovuten’s INVESTIGATION 
As a check upon the returns secured by the question- 
naire and also for the purpose of presenting a more de- 
tailed analysis of the topics whose retention is regarded 
as questionable, we include the results of an investiga- 
tion conducted by Mr. L. H. Van Houten.

Note. — Mr. L. H. Van Houten, Superintendent of Schools, Toledo, 
Iowa, made an intensive study of one hundred forty-eight courses of study 
in arithmetic and then checked his inferences by a questionnaire investi- 
gation. His results were accepted as a Master’s thesis at the University 
of Iowa, and are on file in the library of that institution. Mr. Van 
Houten has granted the authors the privilege of drawing heavily upon 
his material. 
A comparison of the results secured by the two in- 
vestigations warrants the conclusion that the course of 
study makers are slightly more progressive when they 
consider elimination impersonally than when they are 
publishing courses of study and reports for their con-
-P-A-G-E-28

stituencies. While this comparison of topics has no 
particular scientific merit, it does reveal a situation full 
of human interest. It also confirms the impression 
secured from the former study that a simplification of 
texts and courses of study in arithmetic is demanded. 
SUMMARY 
Summarizing, it should be said that the present 
tendency among superintendents is in favor of the elim- 
ination of questionable matter in the field of arith- 
metic. While as yet there is not perfect agreement as 
to just what all of this questionable subject matter is, 
there is rather clear agreement in regard to certain 
subjects, such as apothecaries’ weight, troy weight, fur- 
long, rood in square measure, dram, quarter in avoir- 
dupois, surveyors’ tables, foreign money, folding paper, 
reduction of more than two steps, long measure, greatest 
common divisor, least common multiple, true discount, 
cube root, partnership, compound proportion, compound 
and complex fractions, annual interest, longitude and time, 
unreal fractions, alligation, metric system, progression, 
aliquot parts. Again, the attitude of the superintendents 
indicates a tendency to give increased attention to the 
following topics: addition, subtraction, multiplication, 
division, fractions, percentage, interest, saving and loan- 
ing money, banking, borrowing, building and loan asso- 
ciations, investments, bonds and stocks, levying of taxes, 
public expenditures, insurance, profit, public utilities.

CHAPTER II 
THE GRADE DISTRIBUTION OF THE 
DIFFERENT ARITHMETICAL TOPICS 
Factors INFLUENCING CHOICE AND SEQUENCE OF 
Topics 
A STUDENT of the courses of study in arithmetic is 
immediately impressed with the fact that wide varia- 
tion exists in grade distribution of the topics. The 
choice and sequence of topics may be determined by the 
mental maturity of the child. Or the choice and se- 
quence may be determined by the logic of the case; 
that is to say, there may be certain topics in arith- 
metic which should precede others, because they are 
preparatory and basic to these later topics. A third 
factor in the determination of the sequence of the topics 
in arithmetic may be that of the social and economic 
conditions affecting the school. For example, while 
it may be desirable, so far as the maturity of the child 
is concerned, for us to postpone certain business applica- 
tions of arithmetic until the later years of the child’s 
school life, we are compelled, nevertheless, to take into 
consideration the fact that large numbers of children 
leave school without completing the elementary course ; 
ai
-P-A-G-E-30
22) THE SUPERVISION OF ARITHMETIC 
and consequently it becomes necessary for us to choose 
between having the child study certain business applica- 
tions at an early date, or not get them at all. 
The supervisor is interested in knowing the adjust- 
ment the American schoolmaster has made to these 
different factors. To what extent has he recognized 
the limitations of immaturity? To what extent has he 
accepted the logical demands of the subject matter? 
To what extent has he recognized the necessity for an 
early introduction of the social and business applica- ° 
tions of arithmetic? 
INVESTIGATIONS 
Three important investigations have been made in 
this field with a view toward finding out the adjustment 
which the school has made in actual practice. Dr. 
Bruce R. Payne in his study of the elementary school 
curriculum in 1906 reported on the grade distribution of 
twenty-nine topics in ten American cities. The Balti- 
more School Commission in 1911 compared the policy of 
thirteen American cities with reference to seven selected 
phases of arithmetic work. Mr. L. H. Van Houten’s 
investigation covers one hundred forty-eight courses of 
study distributed throughout the United States. 
The following table based on the study of Dr. Payne 
shows the grade distribution in ten American cities.

the cities agree that numeration and notation should be 
taught in the first three grades ; addition and subtraction 
in the third grade; fractions in the fifth grade; and de- 
nominate numbers in the sixth grade. The figures reveal 
a great disparity of opinion in regard to the other topics.

DISTRIBUTION OF THE ARITHMETICAL TOPICS 25 
The Commission drew the following conclusions from 
the foregoing table: “From the above table it appears 
that the forty-five combinations in arithmetic are learned 
in all but two of the cities in the second grade. The 
most common grade in which the multiplication tables 
are learned is the third. Long division is taught most 
commonly in the fourth grade; addition and subtrac- 
tion, multiplication and division of fractions, and 
decimals are taught most commonly in the fifth grade ; 
and percentage in the sixth.” 
Addition and subtraction of fractions, however, are 
taught in these cities in grades as low as the third and 
as high as the fifth; multiplication and division of frac- 
tions appear in grades as low as the fourth and as high 
as the sixth; decimals are taught in grades as low as 
the fourth and as high as the sixth. 
The investigation of Dr. Payne and the Baltimore 
Commission related to the grade distribution of topics 
in'a small group of large cities only. The most thor- 
oughgoing investigation of the problem was made by 
Mr. L. H. Van Houten in 1913. 
Tue VAN HouteN INVESTIGATION 
Mr. Van Houten based his report upon orie hundred 
and forty-eight courses. Cities ranging in population 
from 1118 to that of New York City are included in 
his report. These cities are located in thirty-seven  
-P-A-G-E-34
  26 THE SUPERVISION OF ARITHMETIC i 
states and in the District of Columbia. State courses 
of study were obtained from nearly every state and 
were used when referred to by the city courses. 
Some of the topics selected were chosen on account 
of their commonly accepted importance and others 
because of the discussion which has arisen concerning 
their elimination. Care was taken to verify all the 
material so far as possible by consulting the texts in use 
when the course was not sufficiently specific. In 
many cases the text was the sole guide, since only text 
assignments were given.

              Nore. — This table should be read as follows: Notation is taught 
in the first grade in 08 cities, in the second grade in 126 cities, etc.   From the foregoing it may be seen that wide varia- 
tion exists in practice —in fact addition is the only 
topic reported in all of the cities in either the second or 
third grade. Subtraction, multiplication, and division 
are almost uniformly taught in the third and fourth 
grades. Only eleven topics are taught in the first and 
 
-P-A-G-E-36
  28 THE SUPERVISION OF ARITHMETIC 
second grades in any of the cities, while almost one 
third of the cities did not teach any of the topics in 
these grades. 
Although five additional topics are taught in a few 
schools in the third grade, the greatest agreement is on 
teaching notation, numeration, addition, subtraction, 
multiplication, division, fractions, denominate numbers, 
multiplication tables, and United States money. 
In the fourth and fifth grades there is a decided in- 
crease in the number of cities teaching factoring, can- 
cellation, decimal fractions, simple accounts, and busi- 
ness forms. 
The upper grades show a marked tendency to select 
fewer of the formal topics and more of the topics which 
have to do with the application to social and economic 
situations. 
Perhaps the most striking fact of the table is that 
there seems to be so little agreement in grade distribu- 
tion of topics. Such variation suggests the desirability 
of our knowing more about the relative success of the 
different schemes of distribution. 
SUMMARY 
The following is a summary showing the modal grade 
in which the various topics are taught : 
Grade I. Variation is such that no mode appears. 
Grade _ II. Variation is such that no mode appears.

It is thus seen that the four fundamental processes 
are most frequently taught in the first four grades. 
Factoring is taught most frequently in the fifth 
grade. 
Cancellation is taught most frequently in the fourth 
grade. 
Fractions are taught most generally in the fifth grade. 
Decimal fractions are taught most frequently in the 
fifth and sixth grades. 
Denominate numbers and mensuration are taught 
quite generally throughout the whole course of eight 
grades, although there is a tendency for this material 
to be taught in the sixth grade or lower. 
Involution and evolution are taught predominately 
in the eighth grade.

Percentage and its applications appear most frequently 
in the sixth and seventh grades. 
The metric system is taught most generally in the 
eighth grade. 
GRADE OCCURRENCE OF SEVEN SPECIFIED TOPICS 
Table VII was made by taking the seven specified 
topics used by the Baltimore Commission’s report. 
It supplements the information given in the preceding 
table, by telling definitely where emphasis is placed on a 
subject. In this table no grades are mentioned unless 
the topics receive their principal treatment there. In 
cities where two grades seemed to be of equal impor- 
tance, both are given. 
As found by the Baltimore Commission in a study of 
the courses of ten cities, the forty-five combinations are 
completed by a majority of schools in the second grade. 
About ten per cent complete these in the third grade 
and only four per cent in the first grade. The mul- 
tiplication tables are generally completed in the third 
grade, though there is greater variation than in the com- 
binations. The fourth grade is the grade of long divi- 
sion. About twenty per cent of the schools teach the 
topic in the third grade, and three per cent in the fifth. 
Formal fractions are taught in the fifth grade by the 
majority of schools. Twenty-eight schools teach addi- 
tion and subtraction of fractions and multiplication and
-P-A-G-E-40
  32 THE SUPERVISION OF ARITHMETIC 
division in different grades. In nineteen of these cases 
the first two processes are taught in the fourth grade 
and the latter in the fifth. Decimal fractions likewise 
have the fifth as the modal grade, though over forty 
per cent of the schools offer the subject in the sixth 
grade. In seventeen cities they are continued :through 
two grades. Grade six is the time when the principles of 
\ percentage are studied. 
The following table shows the practice in the cities 
studied :

The foregoing table should be read thus: In Aberdeen, South 
Dakota, the forty-five combinations are completed in the second grade; 
the multiplication tables are learned in the third grade. Long division 
is taught in the fourth grade. Addition and subtraction of fractions 
are taught in the fifth grade. Multiplication and division of fractions 
are taught in the fifth grade. Decimals are taught in the fifth grade; 
percentage is taught in the sixth grade. Column r represents the

SUMMARY 
In summarizing this, Mr. Van Houten says: 
“The forty-five combinations are completed by a 
majority of schools in the second grade. About ten 
per cent complete these in the third grade and only four 
per cent in the first grade. The multiplication tables 
are generally completed in the third grade, though 
there is greater variation in this particular than in the 
  completion of the forty-five combinations. The fourth

=. 38 THE SUPERVISION OF ARITHMETIC 
grade is the grade of long division. About twenty 
per cent of the schools teach the topic in the third grade, 
and three per cent in the fifth. Formal fractions are 
taught in the fifth grade by the majority of schools. 
Twenty-eight schools teach addition and subtraction of 
fractions and multiplication and division of fractions in 
different grades. In nineteen of these cases the first two 
processes are taught in the fourth grade and the latter 
in the fifth. Decimal fractions likewise are taught in 
grades five, six, and seven, yet the fifth grade is pre- 
dominantly the grade in which decimal fractions are 
taught. Although percentage appears in the sixth, 
seventh, and eighth grades, and in some cases as low as 
the fifth, yet the sixth grade is the most frequent grade 
in which percentage is taught.”

CHAPTER III 
TIME ALLOTMENT FOR ARITHMETIC 
VARYING THE EMPHASIS UPON ARITHMETIC 
ARITHMETIC has been held in varying degrees of esteem 
in the past. At certain stages of civilization little at- 
tention was given to the quantitative interpretation 
of the environment of the individual. The early Massa- 
chusetts enactment of 1647 in regard to education ordered 
that reading and writing schools be established in every 
community of fifty householders. No doubt a certain 
amount of arithmetic was taught in these early reading 
and writing schools, yet the facts indicate that arith- 
metic when taught at all was taught incidentally. No 
formal recognition of the subject was given in connec- 
tion with the time allotment in the daily program. 
Even though arithmetic was included in the ‘Seven 
Liberal Arts,” it should be borne in mind that, as a sub- 
ject for elementary education for the masses, it was not 
considered of importance until relatively late. The 
demand for a knowledge of arithmetic came with the 
development of commerce in New England in the latter 
39 
 
-P-A-G-E-48
    
40 THE SUPERVISION OF ARITHMETIC 
| part of the eighteenth century and with the expansion 
of commercial activity in the nineteenth century. 
The early grammar school, both in New England 
and elsewhere in this country, gave arithmetic a place. 
The arithmetic of the grammar school period was of an 
elementary character, and was not infrequently differ- 
entiated into several parts. This’ tendency to differ- 
entiate the subject matter of arithmetic into various 
parts was even more strikingly emphasized during the 
“academy period” (1780-1835), when courses were 
offered in navigation, accounts, bookkeeping, and the 
like. The academy gave the subject a definite allot- 
ment of time. ; 
With the establishment of high schools in Boston, 
New York, and elsewhere, arithmetic received definite 
recognition. It was included in the list of subjects for 
which provision was made by the Massachusetts law 
of 1827 for all communities of fifty or more families 
or households, and from this time on it was almost 
invariably included in the curriculum. Not only was 
arithmetic taught in what we would call to-day the 
elementary schools, but it was included in the curricu- 
lum of the Boston Latin School, the Boston English 
High School, the Boston Girls’ High School, and the 
Leicester Academy. 
Arithmetic was required in all elementary schools in 
the state of Massachusetts by the law of 1789. The
-P-A-G-E-49
  / 
TIME ALLOTMENT FOR ARITHMETIC 41 
fact is that with the rise of the academy and the high 
school it received definite recognition in the daily pro- 
gram of almost every school. With the establishment of 
the “Common Schools” throughout the United States, 
which accompanied the development of the West, arith- 
metic was included as an essential part of every public 
school curriculum. 
While legislation and public opinion both responded 
to the social demands that arithmetic should be taught, 
it remained for the schoolmaster to determine the 
amount of time it should receive. As the general pub- 
lic from time to time placed new emphasis upon the 
arithmetical attainments of the pupils, the school- 
master tended to devote more and more time to the 
subject, with the belief that increased proficiency de- 
pended upon an increased amount of time being allotted 
to the subject. Thus the popular criticism to the 
effect that the students were inefficient in arithmetic 
resulted in many cases in an increase in the number of 
school years in which arithmetic was studied. This 
adjustment has been questioned recently. 
A few years ago Mr. J. M. Rice undertook to analyze 
the conditions under which arithmetic was being taught. 
He found that wide variation existed in the.amount of 
time which cities were devoting to the subject. After 
analyzing the results of a somewhat elaborate. series of 
tests which he gave to elementary school children in a
-P-A-G-E-50
  
42 THE SUPERVISION OF ARITHMETIC 
number of cities, he arrived at the following conclusions : 
“The amount of time devoted to arithmetic in the 
school that attained the lowest average, twenty-five per 
cent, was practically the same as in the one where the 
highest “ge eighty per cent, was obtained. In 
the former th 
was forty-five minutes a day, but some additional time regular time for arithmetic in all grades 
was given. In the latter the time varied in the differ- 
ent grades, but averaged fifty-three minutes daily. The 
schools showing the most favorable results cannot be 
accused of making a fetish of arithmetic. These state- 
ments are further justified by the fact that the four 
| 
the same amount of time to arithmetic as the schools 
which stood 1 
Dr. C. W. Stone? later conducted an investigation on schools which on the whole stood highest gave practically 
west.”” 
“Arithmetical abilities and some of the factors deter- 
mining them,” partly for the purpose of determining 
whether the amount of time given to the arithmetic 
recitation was a factor in arithmetical efficiency. He 
found among the thirteen schools that devoted less than 
the median time to the arithmetic recitation that the 
work was slightly better than in the thirteen schools 
which devoted more than the median time. Dr. Stone 
says: “What is claimed is that as the present practice 
it Rice, Scientific Management in Education, p. 119. 
2 Stone, Arithmetical Abilities, p. 62.  
-P-A-G-E-51
  
TIME ALLOTMENT FOR ARITHMETIC 43, 
goes, a large amount of time spent on arithmetic is no 
guarantee of a high degree of efficiency in arithmetic. 
If one were to choose at random among the schools with 
more than the median time given to arithmetic, the 
chances are about equal that he would get a school with 
inferior products: and conversely, if one were to choose 
among the schools with less than the median time given, 
the chances are about equal that he would get a school 
with a superior product in arithmetic.” 
While the foregoing statements do not dispose of the 
debatable points as to the amount of time which may 
be given profitably to arithmetic in the public schools, 
they do tend to shake our faith in the belief that in- 
creased arithmetical efficiency is a function of time ex- 
penditure. Experimental education will no doubt have 
additional contributions to make to this problem within 
a comparatively short time. In the meantime, how- 
ever, the school superintendent who wishes to profit by 
the experience of other superintendents is interested in 
the policy of schools throughout the country with refer- 
ence to this matter. 
One of the important contributions to this problem 
has been made by Dr. Bruce R. Payne. Dr. Payne 
undertook to discover the relative amount of time 
which was being given to arithmetic recitations in the 
leading cities in this country in 1904. He collected and 
collated data with regard to the percentage of recitation  
-P-A-G-E-52
  44 THE SUPERVISION OF ARITHMETIC 
time given to each of the subjects in the elementary 
school curriculum in the following cities: New York, 
Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, San Francisco, Columbus, 
Ga., Louisville, Jersey City, New Orleans, and Kansas 
City, Kan. The following table shows the average 
per cent of recitation time given to arithmetic in each 
grade in these cities:

  Arithmetic . | 13. pass iese 18.0 | 17.6 | 18.3 | 17.7 | 17.0 | 16.975 
He found that arithmetic was second only to reading 
and literature in the amount of time expenditure in the 
daily programs of these cities. 
In the investigation of this same topic in 1911 by the 
committee appointed to study the system of education 
in the public schools of Baltimore, of which Dr. E. E. 
Brown, then commissioner of education of the United 
States, was chairman, it was discovered that there was 
a wide variation in the total amount of time given to 
the study of arithmetic and algebra in New York, 
Chicago, Philadelphia, St. Louis, Boston, Cleveland, 
Baltimore, Pittsburgh, Detroit, San Francisco, Mil- 
waukee, and Cincinnati. The range of variation in 
recitation time per week was from 1125 minutes in St. 
 
-P-A-G-E-53
  TIME ALLOTMENT FOR ARITHMETIC 45 
Louis to 2080 minutes in Cincinnati. The percentage 
of school time devoted exclusively to the study of 
arithmetic and algebra in these cities varied from 10 
per cent in Chicago to almost 19 per cent in Cincinnati. 
This variation, in view of the findings of Mr. Rice and 
Mr. Stone, suggests the probability that the time given 
to arithmetic is not being used to an equal advantage 
in all these cities. It is possible that Chicago, which is 
giving only tro per cent of its time to arithmetic, is get- 
ting just as good results as Cincinnati, which is giving 
almost twice as much time to arithmetic. 
The material which is presented in the following 
tables indicates that these cities have been doing more 
or less experimenting with this important problem.

It should be noted in the above that New York and 
St. Louis in the period from 1888 to 1904 made definite 
attempts to decrease the relative time given to arith- 
metic recitations, while Chicago increased the percent-

the same. 
The Baltimore Commission furnished the following 
table, which shows conditions in 1890 and 1910 and 
IQIL:

It is interesting to note in the above that more than 
one half of the cities reduced the per cent of time 
expenditure during the twenty years included in this 
comparison. New York, which in 1890 was giving 26.2 
per cent of her total time to arithmetic, dropped back 
_ to 13.4 per cent in 1910. The average time given by the 
ten cities in 1890 was 16.51 per cent, and in 1910-11 
it was 15.38 per cent. 
The situation in foreign countries does not differ 
greatly from the situation in America. Dr. Payne col- 
lected data from ten leading cities in England, ten in 
Germany, and ten in France, showing an average per 
cent of time given to the recitation of arithmetic.

Dr. Payne found that “in arithmetic the English 
courses show 3 per cent more time than American, with 
about 5 per cent more in the earlier grades.”” He says 
that as in America the relative time assigned to arith- 
metic makes it second in importance to language. The 
variation between ten German cities is about the same 
as between ten American cities. The relative time 
ranges from 14 per cent to 22.8 per cent in the German 
cities, and between 12 per cent and 19.5 per cent in 
American cities. The above table shows that the 
French schools devote a smaller proportion of time to 
arithmetic than do the schools of the other countries. 
In 1913 a study was made by the authors of the 
amount of time devoted to recitations in arithmetic in 
six hundred and thirty cities in the United States having 
a population of four thousand and over. It was found 
that the variation in the number of minutes per week 
given to arithmetic ranged from no time at all up to 
450 minutes. The time distribution for the different 
grades is given in the table below:

5° THE SUPERVISION OF ARITHMETIC 
From left to right this table means that there are 
136 cities that give no time to recitations in arithmetic 
in the first grade, 31 cities that give no time to it in 
the second grade, and 4 that ignore it in the third 
grade. From the top down the table reads: 136 cities 
give no time to arithmetic recitations in the first grade; 
7 give fifteen minutes per week in the first grade; 18, 
twenty-five minutes ; 10, thirty minutes, etc. The range 
for the first grade is from no time to 450 minutes per 
week, and it is practically the same for the other grades. 
The median number of minutes per week devoted to 
recitations in arithmetic in the different grades is shown 
in the following table:

Chart V shows graphically the difference in variation 
and the central tendency in practice. 
Attention is directed to the upper and lower quartiles. 
It will be noted that the cases included within the middle 
50 per cent are close to the median. The lower 25 
percentile shows that one fourth of the cities spend 
25 minutes or less in the first grade; 75 minutes or less 
in the second grade; 100 minutes or less in the third
-P-A-G-E-59
  TIME ALLOTMENT FOR ARITHMETIC 51 
and fourth grades; 125 minutes or less in the fifth and 
sixth grades; and 150 minutes or less in the seventh 
and eighth grades. Again, the upper quartile brings 
out the fact that another fourth of the cities spend roo 
minutes or more in the first grade; 125 minutes or more

in the second grade; 150 minutes or more in the third 
grade; 200 minutes or more in the fourth, fifth, sixth, 
seventh, and eighth grades. From the foregoing analy- 
sis it may be seen that some cities spend relatively far 
more recitation time than others on arithmetic. 
 
-P-A-G-E-60
    52 THE SUPERVISION OF ARITHMETIC 
Comparison of the 150 cities spending the greatest 
amount of time with the 150 cities spending the least 
amount of time indicates that already many of these 
cities are making headway in the economy of time. 
If one fourth of the cities can get satisfactory results 
with an expenditure of from 5 to 20 minutes per day 
or less in each of the first four grades, there is reason 
for inquiry as to the accomplishment of cities which 
spend from 20 to 40 minutes or more per day in these 
grades. Again, if one fourth of the cities are able to 
get satisfactory results in from 20 to 30 minutes per 
day or less in the fifth to eighth grades, certainly we 
have cause to question the reason why another one 
fourth of the cities spend from 4o to 60 minutes or more 
per day in those grades. On the whole, it seems safe 
to say that the wide variation of recitation time in the 
various cities of the United States suggests the possi- 
bility of attempting to effect an economy of time by 
means of standardizing the number of minutes in the 
recitation period. It is true that we need a compari- 
son of the actual results obtained in all cities giving 
a large amount of time to the recitation of arith- 
metic, with all cities giving a small amount of time. 
In the absence of scientific data touching all cities, 
however, it is important that we take cognizance of the 
fact that the investigations which have thus far been 
made by Rice, Stone, and others, all indicate that there
-P-A-G-E-61
  “TIME ALLOTMENT FOR ARITHMETIC 53 
is no assurance of doubling the efficiency in arithmetic 
by doubling the recitation time. Therefore, it seems 
safe to recommend that the supervisor modify practice 
in a particular city on the basis of the experience of 
supervisors elsewhere, and such experimental evidence 
as has been obtained. 
If those cities spending more than the median 
amount of recitation time would reduce their schedule 
to the median time, a decided economy might be effected. 
In doing this no one would be adopting an untried 
policy, as the 157 superintendents who are included 
within the first quarter have already adopted this 
policy. It is difficult to believe that the results attained 
in the 315 schools reporting the median time expendi- 
ture are distinctly inferior to the results attained in the 
other schools. : 
Further analysis of these data indicates that the North 
Atlantic and South Atlantic cities spend from 25 per 
cent to 50 per cent more time in arithmetic than do the 
cities in the other parts of the country. Large cities 
seem to give more time to arithmetic recitations than 
do small cities, although the difference is not great. 
The county superintendents report a very much smaller 
amount of time given to the arithmetic recitations in 
the rural schools. This is, no doubt, due to a differ- 
ence in the organization of the daily program in the 
rural schools. However, it should be noted that no- 
 
-P-A-G-E-62

section or city differs so much from the central tendency 
as to make it difficult to work toward some part of the 
lower half of the curve of time distribution for recita- 
tions in each grade. That is to say, each city might 
wisely try the following time expenditure : 
TABLE XV 
Numser oF MInvuTES or Less PER WEEK IN Each GRADE 
GRADES a | IL UI Iv Vv VI VI | VIII 
Median minutes .| 75 | 100 | 125 | 150 | 150 | 150 | 150 | 170 
  
  
This table becomes clear when read as follows: The 
median time expenditure per week in the first grade 
is 75 minutes, or 15 minutes per day; in the second 
grade 100 minutes, or 20 minutes per day; in the third, 
125 minutes, or 25 minutes per day; in the fourth, 
fifth, sixth, and seventh grades 150 minutes, or 30 minutes 
per day; in the eighth grade 170 minutes per week, or 
a little less than 35 minutes per day. 
RELATIVE Time EXPENDITURE 
The supervisor who adopts the standard proposed 
above may do so with the assurance which comes with 
the knowledge that this is the generalized experience 
of other teachers, principals, and supervisors, This
-P-A-G-E-63
  TIME ALLOTMENT FOR ARITHMETIC 55 
standard more nearly represents the judgment of the 
American schoolmaster, based on generations of ex- 
perience in teaching arithmetic, than does any other 
standard. 
The amount of time arithmetic should receive in 
relation to the other subjects of study is a factor of 
importance in making school programs. A critical 
study of the time distribution in one hundred forty-eight 
cities was made by Mr. Van Houten for the purpose of 
determining this relationship. The material was first 
distributed to show the total number of minutes per 
week given to arithmetic. This distribution is shown 
in the next table. 
The meaning of this table becomes clear when read 
thus: Akron, Ohio, spent 250 minutes per week on 
arithmetic in the first grade, 300 minutes in the second 
grade, 300 minutes in the third grade, 300 minutes in 
the fourth grade, 275 minutes in the fifth grade, 275 
minutes in the sixth grade, 300 minutes in the seventh 
grade, 300 minutes in the eighth grade. In all 2300 
minutes were given over to arithmetic. 11,100 minutes 
were given over to recitation in all subjects each 
week. Arithmetic received 20.7 per cent of the total 
time. 
Table XVI is a summary of Table XV.

total amount of time per week given to arithmetic. 
The range is from 640 to 3075 minutes. No mode or 
central tendency is discoverable in the table. The same 
situation prevails when the facts presented in the foregoing 
table are brought together in closer formation by using 
a larger unit.

CHAPTER IV 
DOMINANCE OF METHODS IN THE TEACH- 
ING OF ARITHMETIC 
Tue TOPICAL VS. THE SPIRAL METHOD 
Metuops in the teaching of arithmetic have been 
stressed differently at different times. Naturally the 
modes of instruction have been colored by the various 
stages through which the subject matter has evolved. 
Arithmetic grew by piecemeal; new topics, sections, or 
divisions were added as they were seen to bear a logical 
relation to old ones. Under the influence of scholars, 
the subject gradually assumed a highly unified and 
logical character. Later, however, it was observed that 
such an organization was not necessarily adapted to 
the most economical learning of the facts and processes 
of arithmetic. Consequently a reaction set in against 
the formal, adult, scientific attempts at the organiza- 
tion of the subject, and a readjustment of the materials 
to harmonize with the maturity levels of children began 
to receive increased attention. The older of these at- 
tempts at the organization of subject matter resulted 
in what is currently known as the topical method of 
F 65
-P-A-G-E-74
  66 THE SUPERVISION OF ARITHMETIC 
} 
instruction; the younger, in what is currently known 
as the spiral method of instruction. By topical method 
is meant the presentation of topics sequentially related 
without any reference to the facility with which they 
may be learned, each topic being completed before the 
next one is presented. By spiral method is meant the 
presentation of recurring topics in widening concentric 
circles in harmony with the age and ability of the chil- 
dren being instructed. The topical method was pre- 
sumed to give a notion of unity and continuity to the 
subject, while the spiral method was presumed to cor- | 
respond to the psychological conditions of learning and 
to insure the fixation of the processes and skills of the 
subject. 
Like every method, each of these, when it was not 
modified by the restraining and clarifying influence of the 
other, tended to swing to an unnatural extreme; this 
was particularly true when either was taught by inade- 
quately trained or unsupervised teachers. We are not 
yet entirely rid of the baneful influence of these over- 
emphases. Although each in its time was an epoch- 
making method, reaction and readjustment were in- 
evitable. As new topics were forced into the textbooks 
in arithmetic, the spirals were shortened, and the pupils 
were bewildered by the more frequent recurrence of the 
same topics. Textbook makers, catching the drift of 
this criticism as it came with ever increasing volume
-P-A-G-E-75
METHODS IN THE TEACHING OF ARITHMETIC 67 
from every section of the country, began to reduce the 
number of the spirals and to lengthen them. 
THE SPIRAL AND TopicaL METHODS IN DIFFERENT 
GEOGRAPHICAL REGIONS 
The present trend of educational sentiment with 
reference to the dominance of these two methods is 
shown in the tables that follow. These tables should 
be of service to textbook writers, to supervisors who 
are selecting textbooks and are planning courses of 
study, and to professionally inclined teachers who are 
interested in the drift of educational theory and practice.

Table XXI is Table XX reduced to per cents. 
Table XXI should be read as follows: 2.9% of the 
“superintendents in the North Central states favor the   
spiral method; 22%, the topical method; and 75%, 
the combination method. 2.2% of all the superin- 
tendents irrespective of lo- 
cation favor the spiral method ; 
23 %, the topical method ; and 
75 %, the combination method.

negligible. Three fourths of the superintendents are of

METHODS IN THE TEACHING OF ARITHMETIC 69 
the opinion that a combination of the two methods results 
in the most successful practice. The relative strength 
of the three groups is shown by Chart VI. 
From the foregoing facts it would seem that which 
method shall prevail is no longer a mooted question. 
Sanity in combining the two methods is almost univer- 
sally demanded by practitioners. For large geographical 
areas there is almost no perceptible variation in practice. 
With reference to this matter one section expects and 
demands what every other section expects and demands. 
THE SPIRAL AND TopicAL METHODS IN CITIES OF 
DIFFERENT SIZE 
Although experience has been generalized for the 
different sections of the United States and for the United 
States as a whole, it remains to be seen whether there 
is any marked variation when these methods are dis- 
tributed for different-sized cities. Not all of the super- 
intendents who replied indicated the size of the city 
whose schools they superintend. The replies that were 
clear are distributed in the next two tables. 
The data were distributed so as to show differences, 
if any, in practice in cities of ten different population 
classes. Cities in Rank I had a population of 1,000,000 
or over ; Rank II, 200,000 to 999,999 ; Rank III, 100,000 
to 199,999; Rank IV, 50,000 to 99,999; Rank V, 30,000

Table XXII shows that 2 superintendents in cities 
of 1,000,000 inhabitants or over favor a combination of 
the two methods; that 2 in cities between 200,000 
F
-P-A-G-E-79
METHODS IN THE TEACHING OF ARITHMETIC 71 
and 1,000,000 prefer the topical, and 14 the combined 
methods; that 1 in a city between 125,000 and 250,000 
prefers the spiral, 7 the topical method, and 23 the 
combined methods. Table XXIII presents the same 
facts reduced to per cents for each of the different-sized 
cities. 
It is clear that the number contending for the spiral 
plan is too small to be worthy of serious consideration. 
It is true that there is a variation of opinion in nearly 
every sized city, except the very largest, but no signifi- 
cant conclusions may be drawn from this variation. 
The fact of most import shown by these tables is 
that the great majority of superintendents, regardless 
of the size of the cities, are agreed that a combination 
of the spiral and topical plans is better than either 
alone. 
THE SANCTION OF USAGE 
We are not here concerned directly with achievement 
or results, but with the opinions of school men as to the 
desirability of certain methods. Naturally the efficacy 
of the two methods is involved, but, so far as we know, 
no trustworthy tests have been made to determine this. 
It is doubtful if any are needed. The laborious processes 
of trial and error, of success and failure, under countless 
varying conditions, have sanctioned in no uncertain 
manner the discontinuance and elimination of the spiral
-P-A-G-E-80
  72 THE SUPERVISION OF ARITHMETIC 
and topical plans as such, and have warranted the as- 
sumption that a combination of the two produces the 
best results. In the long run experience gained in this 
way is likely to be right. Until some one actually dis- 
proves that it is wrong or produces data that question 
its soundness, superintendents both young and old will 
be warranted in subscribing to those conditions and 
standards which their educational forbears have spent 
years in evolving. ‘The weight of the testimony is so 
preponderantly in favor of a combination of the spiral 
and topical methods as to leave little room for doubt. 
It is true that many questions relating to these two 
methods have been left unanswered. Our data do not 
show the exact manner in which this combination 
should be effected nor do they show how the material 
should be distributed grade by grade. Matters of such 
paramount importance as these have already attracted 
the attention of textbook makers, and there is scarcely 
a text of the last half dozen years that does not rep- 
resent an attempt to make the proper adjustments. 
These are still matters of opinion that should be sub- 
mitted to scientific scrutiny and investigation. But the 
men who are in the best position to do this are the super- 
intendents themselves, and they are not likely to‘have 
the time or the inclination to do work of this character. 
Unless the experimental educationist comes to their 
rescue — and he is always likely to be handicapped by
-P-A-G-E-81
METHODS IN THE TEACHING OF ARITHMETIC 13 
remoteness from or unfamiliarity with actual school- 
room situations — we shall again “cut and try” through 
years of painful and more or less blind experimenting 
until by some happy turn of the wheel of fortune we 
shall arrive at a solution of our problem. 
METHODS OF SUBTRACTION 
There are other phases of method concerning which 
superintendents have rather decided opinions. One of 
these relates to the manner in which subtraction shall 
be taught. Two methods are in vogue; one, the method 
of “taking from”; and the other, the so-called Austrian 
method of addition. Those who advocate teaching 
subtraction by “taking from” insist that there is no 
subtraction in the Austrian method, and those who 
advocate the Austrian method insist that it is far 
more psychological than the method of “taking 
from” because it does not involve a new mode of 
learning. The advocates of the Austrian method also 
contend that the skill acquired by its use will be 
more serviceable since it corresponds to the making 
change method employed by the business world. We 
are not now concerned with a presentation of the 
arguments of the two contending groups. Our prob- 
lem is to determine the extent to which each of the 
devices has the sanction of usage. No doubt there are 
those who will maintain that usage is no measure of
-P-A-G-E-82
74 THE SUPERVISION OF ARITHMETIC 
the value of a tool. Such a criticism is entitled to 
consideration when the tool is used by an unintelligent 
or unskilled class of people; but when it is employed 
day after day and year after year with children of 
varying ages and circumstances by teachers and super- 
intendents of reputed training and skill, such a criticism 
seems groundless. Surely the testimony of superin- 
tendents and teachers with reference to the intellectual 
instruments they daily use should be regarded as expert 
testimony. 
VARIATION OF SUBTRACTION METHODS IN DIFFERENT 
GEOGRAPHICAL AREAS 
The following tables show that the Austrian method 
is universally regarded as second in importance, and that 
only a relatively small number and per cent of superin- 
tendents favor both methods.

According to Table XXIV, 96 of 245 superintendents 
in the North Central states would teach subtraction by 
the Austrian method, 134 
would teach subtraction by 
the “taking from” method, 
and 15 would use both 
methods. The same facts

to 8.3 per cent for superintendents in the Western

states, is the agreement in the different geographical 
areas in regard to the undesirability of using both 
methods. For the country at large less than 5 per 
cent of the total number of superintendents is convinced 
of the value of using both methods. Here, as elsewhere 
in this material, we have fairly conclusive evidence 
that superintendents favor a specific way of doing 
things. 
An examination of the percentile array shows that 
there is wide divergence of opinion among the different 
sections of the country. Seventy per cent of the super- 
intendents in South Central states favors “taking 
from,” while only 42.8 per cent of the superintendents 
in the Western states favors this method; this is a 
difference of 28.2 per cent. Such a difference cannot 
be accounted for by a difference in the mathematical 
necessities of the two sections of the country, for the 
practice of the South Atlantic states, as shown by the 
percentages, corresponds almost exactly to the central 
tendency of the country as a whole. It should be noted 
that the division of emphasis found in country schools 
closely corresponds with the division for the United 
States in general. 
From the data thus far presented one cannot main- 
tain that there is a marked tendency in either direction, 
nor can one safely predict what the practice of to-morrow 
will be,

  78 THE SUPERVISION OF ARITHMETIC 
These tables show that the large cities favor the 
Austrian method, while the smaller cities favor the 
“taking from” method. It is admitted that educa- 
tional progress usually takes root first in the large 
cities, and that tradition and conservatism are clung 
to more tenaciously in the rural and _ semi-rural 
districts. If these generalizations apply in this case, 
then we have here a positive tendency. It is true 
that a superintendent in a given sized city can by 
inspection determine whether he is to be counted 
with the majority or the minority, but he learns 
nothing from these tables as to what the tendency 
is, unless it be true that the practice of the large 
cities represents educational progress. He will know 
the extent to which his practice varies from current 
practice, and the remodification of emphasis that 
must be made in order to make his practice correspond 
more closely to the central tendency. Certainly super- 
intendents in cities of Class I and those in Class VII, 
whose schools represent the extreme variations from 
the central tendency, need to justify their practice. 
It is to be regretted that there are no conclusive 
results to submit regarding this phase of, instruction. 
We merely have here another problem awaiting solution. 
Intelligent observation and experimentation are needed 
to determine which of the two methods is the more 
economical and which will produce the better results.

  CHAPTER V 
THE SEQUENCE OF THE MULTIPLICATION 
TABLES 
Tue INFLUENCE OF TRADITION 
Custom and convention have heretofore determined 
the order in which the multiplication tables have been 
taught. The custom has prevailed of teaching them in 
the order of the digits. This custom arose because it was 
presumed that the digits had originated in a 1, 2, 3 
order. There is not the slightest evidence that this 
is true. So far as we have any evidence it tends to show 
that the digits were not invented in any regular order. 
It has long been a question with which school super- 
visors everywhere have been concerned, as to whether 
or not the present logical order of presentation is after 
all the most pedagogical. It is barely possible that the 
most difficult order of mastering the multiplication tables 
is the 1, 2, 3 order. Numerous experiments at varying 
this order have been tried, but, so far as we know, none 
of them bear the stamp of careful scientific work under 
controlled conditions. As yet we have no reliable in- 
formation as to the best sequential arrangement of the 
tables for teaching purposes.

THE SEQUENCE OF THE MULTIPLICATION TABLES 81 
According to Table XXVIII, out of 186 superintendents 
in the North Central states 58 maintain that the multi- 
plication tables should be taught in the regular order, 
57 that they should be taught in a 2, 4, 5, 10 order, 5 
that the combinations should be presented without any 
reference to order, 15 that an order is of no importance 
whatever, and 51 that any miscellaneous order will be 
satisfactory. The distribution of the replies from the 
other geographical divisions may be read in the same 
way. Table XXIX is Table XXVIII reduced to 
per cents. 
The second column in each of these tables — the one 
headed 2, 4, 5, 10 — is unsatisfactory, for the reason that 
the 132 superintendents who insisted upon this order 
did not agree as to the order that should prevail for 
the other tables. Some said 3, 6, 7, 8,9; others, 8, 3, 6, 
7,9; still others, 8, 3, 9, 7, 6; still others, 8, 3, 6, 9, 7; 
every possible combination, in fact, was presented. 
It will be noted from these tables that a majority 
of the superintendents are of the opinion that the regular 
order is not the best order. Thirty-three or 6.4 per 
cent of the superintendents insist that no tables at all 
should be given, — that the combinations should be 
presented without reference to any systematic arrange- 
ment. Thirty-eight or 7.3 per cent insist that the order 
of the tables is not a matter of importance, and 23.4 per 
cent believe that a miscellaneous presentation of them 
G 
   
-P-A-G-E-90
  82 THE SUPERVISION OF ARITHMETIC 
insures the most satisfactory results. Only 37.5 per 
cent cling to the traditional order. 
Chart VIII shows roughly that four superintendents 
in every ten are satisfied with the regular order and that 
a little over one half are not in agreement as to the order 
that should be used. 
An inspection of the vari- 
ation of the different geo- 
graphical regions as indicated 
by the first column of Table 
XXIX suggests the lack of 
agreement. The range is from     : 31.2 per cent in the Central 
(J Regular Order ZZ 25,45,55 10°, ete. states to 53 per cent in the 
(22S Combinations South Atlantic states. The 
Nea per ane tables indicate that the North 
Cuarr VIII. Central states are least dis- 
posed to cling to tradition and that the South Atlantic 
states are most conservative in this matter. 
The difference between the extremes in the miscel- 
laneous column—the North Central and the South 
Atlantic states—is 16.8 per cent. The divergences in the 
other cases are so marked as to indicate that much experi- 
menting needs to be done before we shall arrive at a final 
solution of this important problem. Undoubtedly we are 
warranted in concluding that we have evidence here of a 
decided tendency to reconstruct a mode of instruction.

THE SEQUENCE OF THE MULTIPLICATION TABLES 83 
If a number of codperative movements could be es- 
tablished and different orders were tried simultaneously 
in a number of places and the results carefully checked by, 
some uniform system, we might hope to determine at 
an early date upon the best order of presentation. 
We have distributed this material on the basis of 
the different-sized cities from which the data were 
collected.

These tables are more instructive than the preced- 
ing tables. The two superintendents from cities of over 
a million inhabitants are evenly divided upon the ad- 
visability of clinging to the regular order, but, with the 
exception of these and those of Class IX, nearly two 
thirds of the superintendents in the other cities are 
agreed that we need a reorganization and readjustment 
of the customary order employed in teaching the multi- 
plication tables. 
The distinguishing characteristic of any single column 
is its variability. For example, only 16.7 per cent of the 
superintendents in cities ranging from 100,000 to 199,999 
believe in the 2, 4, 5, 10 order, while 37.9 per cent of those 
in cities between 10,000 and 14,999 and 50 per cent of 
 
-P-A-G-E-93
  
THE SEQUENCE OF THE MULTIPLICATION TABLES 85 
those in cities of 1,000,000 or over advocate this order. 
None of the superintendents in cities of Class I, IIT, or V 
refer to teaching multiplication wholly by combinations, 
while 10 per cent of those in Class VII and 15.4 per cent 
of those in Class II urge this plan. Combining the re- 
plies of those listed in columns four and five, those who 
would insist upon some order but who are not con- 
cerned about any exact order, we have a variation 
ranging from 15.8 per cent in cities of 8000 to 9999 to 
50 per cent in cities of 100,000 to 199,999. 
No decided tendency can be detected in any of the 
columns nor in any of the different-sized cities, unless it 
be the general dissatisfaction that seems to prevail with 
the existing mode of procedure. Apparently superin- 
tendents are still at sea with reference to this phase of 
technique. 
Tue Errect oF EDUCATIONAL DISSATISFACTION 
An examination of such tables as these tends to inten- 
sify the general feeling of unrest that these tables reveal. 
The prevalence of a widespread dissatisfaction with the 
regular order of teaching the multiplication tables is, we 
believe, healthy and will in the long run result in more 
economical instruction. 
A superintendent may utilize the tables to discover 
the particular group of reactionaries or conservatives to 
which he belongs. For it will be observed that super-  
-P-A-G-E-94
- 86 THE SUPERVISION OF ARITHMETIC 
intendents in Class IV apparently are not so conserva- 
tive as those in Class IX, while those in Class IV are 
more radical than those in Class I. After all, the par- 
ticular group to which one belongs is a relative matter. 
School supervisors of every degree of experience will 
find many questions in this part of this investigation. 
Those who have reached a final conclusion regarding 
this whole matter, if there be any such, should give 
their results to the world so that the uninitiated may 
not stumble into the pitfalls of tradition. On the basis 
of our returns, it seems that sound advice cannot be 
given to a young superintendent. The only conclusion 
to which we can come is that the old order is still the 
prevailing order, and that the prevailing tendency is 
to try to find some other.

  CHAPTER VI 
ORAL WORK IN ARITHMETIC 
WHILE it is true from one point of view to state that 
all teaching in the elementary grades is of an oral charac- 
ter, yet in recent years there has come to be a more or 
less sharp differentiation between the oral and other types 
of work. It isstated in many courses of study that work 
of a certain grade is to be treated orally, or that a certain 
bit of subject matter is to be treated orally. Conse- 
quently it is very difficult to make a true interpretation of 
any statements relating to the amount of oral work done 
in any subject. 
The authors asked the superintendents in the cities 
throughout the country in towns of four thousand and 
over, to state “the per cent of recitation time in each 
grade which should be given to oral work in each grade.”

value. The replies from one half of the superintendents 
throughout the country are tabulated in Table XXXII,

The table should be read as follows: In the North 
Central territory the median per cent of recitation time 
devoted to the oral work in arithmetic is 66 per cent 
in the first grade; in the North Atlantic territory, 
47.5 per cent; in the Western territory, 55 per cent; 
in the South Atlantic territory, 54 per cent. The aver- 
age of the medians for the country as a whole for the 
first grade is 55.3 per cent. It will be observed from an 
examination of this table that there is a regular and 
fairly gradual reduction in the median amount of time 
given to oral work with each succeeding grade. This 
no doubt is what we should expect. As students in-
-P-A-G-E-97
ORAL WORK IN ARITHMETIC 89 
crease in maturity and in facility they should grow more 
and more able to work independently of the teacher. 
One of the measures of the effectiveness of instruction 
is the extent to which pupils can work independently 
of the teacher in those subjects in which they have been 
instructed for a long time. 
Attention is directed to the fact that the median time 
given to the oral recitation work in arithmetic in the 
first, second, fourth, and fifth grades is high in the 
North Central states. The Western states show the high 
per cent of recitation time given to oral work in arith- 
metic in the third, sixth, seventh, and eighth grades. 
However, these variations are not great. 
In order to ascertain whether differences in regard to 
the median per cent of time given to the oral work in 
arithmetic exist in different-sized cities, the following table 
was prepared:

go THE SUPERVISION OF ARITHMETIC 
This table should be read as follows: In cities of 
100,000 or over the median per cent of recitation time 
devoted to oral work in arithmetic in the first grade is 
57 per cent; in cities between 30,000 and 100,000, 
42 per cent; between 15,000 and 30,000, 49 per cent; 
between 10,000 and 15,000, 34 per cent; between 8000 
and 10,000, 26 per cent; between 4000 and 8000, 
23 per cent; and the average of the country as a whole 
being 39 percent. It will be noted that the median per 
cent of recitation time given to oral work in arithmetic is 
highest in the first grade. The highest median per cent 
of recitation time for the second and third grades is found 
in cities of from 15,000 to 30,000 population. No sharp 
lines of distinction can be drawn for grades four, five, 
and six. The median per cent of recitation time given 
to oral work in the seventh and eighth grades is greater 
in the smaller cities. It seems that the larger the city the 
greater the amount of time given in the lower grades to oral 
work and the more constant is the reduction of time grade 
by grade, while the smaller the city the more uniform is 
the amount of time given to oral work grade by grade. 
While it is true that these data may not be absolutely 
accurate, yet in consideration of the fact that these replies 
were received from cities of varying sizes, located in differ- 
ent parts of the country, we believe that they are fairly 
reliable, and of importance to the supervisor of the 
teaching of arithmetic.
-P-A-G-E-99
  
ORAL WORK IN ARITHMETIC g1 
The opportunities for waste in connection with the 
oral treatment of a subject like arithmetic are great. 
It is desirable for the supervisor to know what is going 
on during this period of oral work. In the first three 
grades about one half of the recitation time is assigned to 
this type of activity; in the intermediate grade about 
one third; in the grammar grades from one sixth to one 
seventh. Hence, there are numerous opportunities for 
wastefulness in the recitation throughout these different 
grades.
-P-A-G-E-100
CHAPTER VII 
DRILL IN ARITHMETIC 
Mucu interest attaches to the general problem of the 
proportion of time which should be given over to drill in 
teaching arithmetic. Many of the theories of modern edu- 
cation have been such as to discourage teachers in the 
matter of drill, and to encourage them to emphasize ration- 
alization of the arithmetical work. This has led many 
teachers to teach the technique of arithmetic inadequately. 
While it is true that no conclusive answers have been 
arrived at by the educational experimentalist, yet it is 
nevertheless important to note that the experiments which 
have been made with a view toward determining the value 
of drill have tended toward the conclusion that drill within 
certain limits is of distinct educational value. Such 
studies as those of Mr. J. C. Brown and Dr. T. J. Kirby 
(referred to in a later chapter) indicate clearly that short 
rapid drill is of importance. Dr. Kirby experimented with 
a group of children in the upper grades, wherein an oppor- 
tunity was given for evaluating the effectiveness of drill 
periods of different lengths. His conclusions were that 
much might be gained through the introduction of a short 
drill period in every arithmetic recitation. 
In a recent investigation conducted by the authors 
g2
-P-A-G-E-101
  
DRILL IN ARITHMETIC 93 
data concerning the per cent of recitation time which 
should be given to drill were received from 564 cities. 
These data were distributed for the different sections of the 
United States and also for the cities of different size for the 
purpose of discovering the variations in practice in each 
grade. The table below shows this variation.

The table should be read thus: The median per cent 
of recitation time favored for strictly drill work in the 
North Atlantic section is 49 for the first grade, 60 for 
the second grade, 69 for the third grade, etc. 
It may be seen that there is a disposition to give a much 
smaller proportion of the time to drill in the upper grades 
than in the lower grades. Though there is a considerable 
variation in the different sections of the country, the 
general emphasis is quite similar. 
The table below shows the data distributed for the 
cities of different size.

This table should be read thus: The median per 
cent of recitation time favored for.strictly drill work 
in cities of 100,000 and over for the first grade is 33, for 
the second grade 46, for the third grade 57, etc. 
It is interesting to note that there seems to be no 
striking differences in the attitude of the superintendents 
in large cities or in small cities. 
Chart IX shows the attitude of superintendents toward 
drill work in the recitations in each grade in the 564 cities. 
The upper line shows that 75 percentile, that is to say, one 
fourth of the superintendents favor the percentage of time 
indicated or more for each grade. For example, one fourth 
of the superintendents favor the giving of 79 per cent or 
more of the time to strictly drill work in the first grade ; 81 
per cent or more to strictly drill work in the second grade ; 
74 per cent or more to strictly drill work in the third grade ; 
64 per cent or more to strictly drill work in the fifth grade ; 
andsoon. The middle line represents the median, which

Chart IX shows the median per cent of recitation 
proposed for strictly drill work in cities of different size 
throughout the country. The close agreement is striking. 
Generalizations based on such wide experience are of im- 
portance in arriving at any satisfactory solution of the 
problem. The fact that the curves descend after the third 
grade is of special interest. 
In the absence of experimental knowledge as to the 
exact per cent of time which should be given to drill, the 
supervisor is interested in knowing what the attitude of 
other supervisors may be in regard to this policy. While 
we have no adequate means of evaluating the comparative 
 
-P-A-G-E-104
  96 THE SUPERVISION OF ARITHMETIC 
arithmetical efficiency obtained in the schools differing in 
the amount of time given over to drill, it is important that 
the amateur know the prevalent practice. It would seem 
safe to say that if one fourth of the cities are devoting 80 
per cent or more of the recitation time in the third grade to 
drill; 50 per cent or more of the recitation time in the fifth 
grade ; and 25 per cent or more of the recitation timein the 
eighth grade, we should inquire into the effectiveness of the 
work in the 140 cities devoting 35 per cent or less in the 
fifth grade, decreasing to 5 per cent or less in the eighth 
grade. In other words, such wide variation suggests the 
probability of waste in the method at this point. 
A thoroughgoing comparison of results attained in cities 
with widely different standards for the time given to drill 
would be of great value if constructive recommendations 
are to be made. However, in view of the results of the 
detailed investigations on the value of drill in arithmetic 
which have thus far been made, we are certain that short 
drill periods produce the best results. 
In the absence of more satisfactory data for the evalu- 
ation of the different degrees of emphasis on drill, it is of 
importance to know the central tendency of practice, based 
on the experience in hundreds of cities. No doubt many

CHAPTER VIII 
GRADE FOR INTRODUCTION OF TEXT IN 
ARITHMETIC 
THE supervisor who has been interested in the prac- 
tice of his neighbor with reference to the introduction of 
a textbook in arithmetic has no doubt been impressed 
with the fact that wide variations exist in this particular. 
Any investigation covering a small number of cities 
presents such wide variations as to make it impossible 
to form an intelligent opinion as to the practice in this 
connection. With data from hundreds of superintend- 
ents distributed throughout the country, however, it 
is possible to make certain generalizations with regard 
to the prevailing practice. The writers, in connection 
with the report of the N. E. A. Committee on Economy 
of Time in Arithmetic, received replies from 754 cities 
bearing upon this problem. General surveys of this sort 
are both interesting and valuable. They show the 
spread of practice and they reveal the standardization 
of opinion. The data collected from the 754 cities are 
presented in the following tables:

  The meaning of this table becomes clear when read 
as follows: Of the 267 cities reporting from the North 
Central territory, 1 introduced a text in the first grade; 
18, in the second grade; 160, in the third grade; 64, 
in the fourth grade; 22, in the fifth grade; and 2 in 
the sixth grade. Again, of the five cities introducing a 
textbook in the first grade, 1 is in the North Central 
territory; 2, in the North Atlantic territory; and 2, 
in the country schools reported by the county su- 
perintendents. Of the 66 schools introducing a text- 
book in the second grade 18 are in the North Central 
territory ; 9, in the North Atlantic territory; 6, in the 
Western territory; 13, in the South Central territory ;° 
4, in the South Atlantic territory; and 16, in the

tention is directed to the variation represented by counties reported by the county superintendents. 
isolated cases; for example, 5 superintendents introduce
-P-A-G-E-107
  
GRADE FOR INTRODUCTION OF TEXT 99 
a textbook in the first grade while 5 other superin- 
tendents do not introduce a textbook until the sixth 
grade. Again, the 66 superintendents who introduce 
a textbook in the second grade disagree in policy 
and practice with the 46 superintendents who intro- 
duce a textbook in the fifth grade. However, despite 
this variation, it is of significance to note that the 
prevailing tendency is to introduce a textbook in 
the third grade or the fourth grade; thus experience 
seems to paint to these as the standard grades for 
the introduction of a textbook. (It should be noted 
that the distribution resembles the distribution to be 
expected by chance.) 
The following table shows the same facts reduced to 
per cents. The third and fourth grades are even more 
clearly shown to be the dominant grades for the intro- 
duction of a textbook. Almost 85 per cent of the 
cities introduce a textbook in one or the other of 
these grades. There seems to be no striking differences 
due to geographical location, the third grade being the 
modal grade in each section of the country, and the 
fourth grade standing second in each section of the 
country. About the same percentage of superintendents 
wait until the ‘fifth grade to introduce the text as 
introduce it in the second grade, and exactly the same 
percentage wait until the sixth as introduce it in the 
first grade.

The meaning of this table becomes clear when read 
as follows: In the North Central territory .3' per cent 
of the schools introduce a textbook in the first grade; 
6.8 per cent, in the second grade; 60 per cent, in the 
third grade; 24 per cent, in the fourth grade; 8.2 per 
cent, in the fifth grade; and .7 per cent, in the sixth 
grade. 
In the absence of striking sectional differences, the ques- 
tion arises as to whether or not differences in the year 
in which a textbook is introduced may not be correlated 
with the size of the city; that is, are textbooks in 
arithmetic introduced earlier or later in large cities 
than in small cities? If one were to hazard an 
opinion on the basis of the foregoing facts, he would 
infer that they are introduced earlier in the smaller 
places. The following table shows how nearly current 
such an opinion is.

The meaning of this table becomes clear when read 
as follows: In the one city of 1,000,000 and over re- 
porting, textbooks are introduced in the third grade. 
Of the fifteen cities of 200,000 to 999,999 reporting, 
r introduces a text in arithmetic in the second grade; 
9, in the third grade; 5, in the fourth grade. 
It is interesting to note that the greater variations 
appear in the smaller cities. All the cities introducing 
arithmetic in the first grade are in towns with a popula- 
tion of 30,000 or less. Four fifths of the cities introducing 
a textbook in arithmetic in the second grade are in cities 
of 15,000 or less. Three fourths of the cities introducing 
a textbook in arithmetic in the fifth grade are in towns 
of 15,000 or less. The variation is revealed even more 
clearly in the table of percentages below.

The meaning of this table becomes clear when read 
as follows: In cities of 1,000,000 population or over, 
roo per cent introduce a textbook in the third grade; 
in cities of 200,000 to 999,999 population, 6.7 per cent 
introduce a textbook in the second grade; 60 per 
cent in the third grade; 33.3 per cent in the fourth 
grade, etc. Here again it is clear that experience has 
been standardized in cities of every size; the third 
grade is the modal grade for the introduction of a text- 
book. Chart X presents this conclusion graphically. 
From the foregoing presentation of replies from super- 
intendents distributed throughout the United States, 
and in cities of different size, we are justified in the 
following conclusions: A superintendent who introduces

a textbook as early as the first or second grade, or who 
postpones the introduction of such text as late as the 
fifth or sixth grade, will do so in the face of generalized 
practice. While we do not know as the result of careful 
investigation the best time to introduce a textbook in 
arithmetic, we do know that in the experience of the

tance for us to know about the results obtained in 
arithmetic work secured in a school which postpones 
the introduction of a textbook until the fifth or sixth 
grade. From an investigation of isolated instances, 
where the textbooks have been introduced very late, 
we have reason to believe that much of the arith- 
 
-P-A-G-E-112
  104 THE SUPERVISION OF ARITHMETIC 
metic work which is commonly associated with the 
textbook is really taught in the earlier grades. In 
other words, the extreme postponement indicated in 
the foregoing table in all probability represents an 
attempt to get away from the use of the textbook, 
rather than an~attempt to get away from the actual 
teaching of arithmetic. 
Again, students of this problem are concerned with 
the question as to which is the better grade for the 
introduction of a text, the third or the fourth grade. 
This can only be determined by careful tests, but the 
amount of time to be saved is of sufficient importance 
to justify the attempt to determine which practice is 
the better. This experimentation is going on, as is 
shown in the foregoing tables. What is needed now is a 
thoroughgoing codperative investigation of results ob- 
tained under the different systems. 
The advocates of the policy of concentration of the 
energy of the school toward the mastery of reading in the 
first three grades may find much to encourage them in 
this report. If a third of the schools are already post- 
poning the introduction of a textbook in arithmetic 
until the fourth grade, there need be little difficulty in 
getting more time for reading during the first three 
grades. 
Students of educational administration who take 
cognizance of the wide variation in age and maturity
-P-A-G-E-113
  
GRADE FOR INTRODUCTION OF TEXT 105 
of children in a particular grade may be led to question 
the advisability of postponing formal instruction in 
arithmetic to the upper grades. Again, the student who 
is conscious of the enormous amount of elimination 
which goes on in the early grades may question the 
policy of allowing children to postpone the introduction 
of a textbook in arithmetic until so late in their scho- 
lastic career. 
 
-P-A-G-E-114
CHAPTER IX 
JUDGING TEXTBOOKS 
Socrety through legislation fixes the curriculum of the 
school. Legal enactments do not go so far, however, 
as to prescribe the topics within the field of a particular 
subject. That task is left to the school officers. The 
schoolmaster usually is assigned the responsibility of 
selecting the particular topics within the various fields 
of subject matter, and of determining the necessary time 
and sequence to be given them. 
Tue TEXTBOOK AS A BASIS FOR THE COURSE 
oF STUDY 
An analysis of courses of study published throughout 
the country by different school boards indicates that 
the particular topics taught, with their sequence and 
time allotments, are determined largely by the nature 
of the textbook in use. The most common statement 
found in a course of study is that the fifth grade is to 
take the material found in the adopted text from pages 
120 to 160 in a given period. Thus, the school officials 
leave the choice and arrangement of particular topics 
106 
 
-P-A-G-E-115
JUDGING TEXTBOOKS 107 
to the textbook writers. Indeed, it may be said that 
textbook writers in America are the ones who determine 
not only the choice and sequence of topics but also 
their gradation. 
In view of this dependence upon the textbook, it is 
important for us to know that textbooks vary in all 
three of the foregoing features. Some textbooks ignore 
completely certain topics which are heavily stressed 
in others. The sequence of topics varies widely. 
The gradation likewise presents astounding differences. 
If the school officials desire to maintain that a text 
with 300 pages, which is to be used in the fifth and 
sixth grade, is to be divided so that 150 pages are 
to be taught in the fifth grade, 150 pages in the sixth 
grade, and that in turn 75 pages are to be taught in the 
first semester, 75 pages in the second semester, 25 pages 
in the first third of the first semester, and so on, they 
should be assured that the textbook is so graded that the 
children will find the units of 25 pages for a six weeks’ 
  
    period to be of equal difficulty. But we do not have   
such assurance. If we are to adapt textbooks to this 
scheme of supervision, it will be necessary for textbook 
writers to grade their material more scientifically. No 
doubt reliance upon the author’s selection of topics 
with their sequence and gradation has been responsi- 
ble for a large share of the unsatisfactory results in 
teaching. 
 
-P-A-G-E-116
    108 THE SUPERVISION OF ARITHMETIC 
PRINCIPLES UNDERLYING CouRSE or STuDY MAKING 
In arithmetic it is of especial importance that the 
supervisor or teacher select each topic with the greatest 
care, with a clear knowledge of the social, economic, and 
psychological features involved. It is likewise necessary 
that the sequence with which these topics are taught 
should be determined by the psychology involved rather 
than by the logic contained in the subject matter. As 
was indicated in an earlier chapter, there is a clear 
tendency toward breaking away from the supposed 
sequences in arithmetic. The teaching of the multi- 
plication tables in the one, two, three order was based 
on the supposed logic of the case. Many teachers have 
found it economical, however, to present the material in 
a two, four, five, ten order. Again, certain theoretical 
considerations have suggested the desirability of post- 
poning decimal fractions until after the completion of 
common fractions. However, it is a fact, that children 
who have completed a study of United States money 
are able to make a study of decimal fractions without 
the knowledge of common fractions. Other instances 
of a similar character abound. The supervisor who is 
intent upon securing maximum results is no longer 
satisfied to trust the sequence of topics within a given 
textbook. Rather will he be interested in establishing 
a sequence of topics on the basis of the child’s difficulty
-P-A-G-E-117
  
JUDGING TEXTBOOKS 109g 
in mastering them and in light of the social need of the 
topics. 
The theory of the graded courses of study is that the 
work will be adapted to the different stages of mental 
maturity. To do this is a difficult task and requires 
keen analysis, experimentation, and constant attention. 
Every supervisor and teacher must recognize the varia- 
tion in ability that exists between classes within the 
same grade and adjust the materials accordingly. If 
the teacher rests content after presenting the material 
according to the plan of the textbook, there need be 
no surprise if the results are unsatisfactory. Every 
wide-awake teacher has recognized the fact that equal 
page allotments of material are of unequal difficulty. 
RELIANCE UPON TEXTBOOKS 
German and French teachers do not rely upon the 
textbook as heavily as American teachers. Foreign 
teachers present their material fresh to the children from 
day to day, grading it as it is given to the needs of the 
particular class under instruction. Whenever we have 
teachers who know the quantitative demands of social 
and industrial life, who know arithmetic as a science, 
and who know children and their individual difficulties, 
we shall have arithmetic taught more effectively, and 
with far less effort than is being expended at the present 
time. 
 
-P-A-G-E-118
    IIo THE SUPERVISION OF ARITHMETIC 
Changes in text are not always made because the new 
book is better than the old book, but because the old 
book has been in use for a considerable number of 
years. It is the fashion to change books periodically, 
and adult human beings — even school teachers and 
superintendents — have not lost their interest in new 
things. The failure to examine new books critically is 
often due to the absence of rational standards. 
CHANGING CHARACTER OF TEXTBOOKS 
A consideration of the adaptability of textbooks is 
one of the duties that falls naturally within the province 
of the supervisor. He looks to them as representing a 
registration of educational progress. Textbook makers 
in the main stand for sanity in practice; they are inter- 
mediators between tradition and radicalism; they seek 
to make progress slowly. An investigation of a number 
of textbooks in arithmetic, ranging over several decades, 
shows that eliminations and additions have followed 
fairly closely upon the changes in business life. 
The table on the opposite page presents a comparison 
of the changes that have occurred in a period of sixty- 
five years in percentage and its applications, as shown 
by a study of ten textbooks. 
It is believed that these texts are fairly typical of the 
periods in which they were used, although it is not 
known that they were used more extensively than others.

II2 THE SUPERVISION OF ARITHMETIC 
It is a matter of regret that when this study was being 
made we were unable to secure a book that was in current 
use between 1856 and 1892. It would probably not have 
revealed any very striking changes, as the 1856 text 
was the most widely used book during this entire period. 
THE FAILURE OF THE SPIRAL PLAN 
A significant modification in the general plan of text- 
book making is indicated by this table as taking place 
near the close of the last century when Hall’s arithmetics, 
No. 9, afterwards known as the Werner arithmetics, 
came into vogue. The distinguishing feature of these 
books was the spiral plan by which each topic was re- 
peated and expanded with mechanical regularity upon 
a later page. This concept was almost literally epoch 
making in the field of school method; it practically 
revolutionized a number of old texts and called forth a 
flood of new ones. But in their ardor to attain a very 
desirable end, many authors overworked the device, 
and, as a consequence, a reaction set in almost immedi- 
ately. The great virtue of the spiral plan, however, 
was that it made us more self-conscious with reference 
to the possibilities of teaching technique. This in- 
creased self-consciousness of the value of method has 
resulted in numerous recent attempts to find a happy 
combination of the two methods, the spiral and the 
topical; for it is generally recognized that either alone
-P-A-G-E-121
  
JUDGING TEXTBOOKS 113 
is unjustifiable, —a fact which we have discussed in 
another connection. 
THE INTEGRATION OF THE SEPARATE UNITS 
There is another very interesting feature of these 
books, —a feature not readily reducible to tabular form, — 
that distinguishes the old from the new books. Formerly 
the different topics or divisions of the subject were in no 
way connected; each new division of the subject was 
begun and treated as if it had no connection with any- 
thing that preceded or followed. Now these topics or 
divisions are as closely connected as human ingenuity 
can make them. Where there were once pages of ex- 
planations and definitions relating to the new subject, 
there are now problems and questions which are in- 
tended to bridge the gap. After a half page of explana- 
tion, including the “General Rule” and an example, 
Ray’s first problem in Profit and Loss is “If my rate of 
gain is 25%, how much should I mark goods for sale 
that cost me $8; $7.50; $6.25; $4.75; $ 3.874; $ 2.623; 
$ 1.93%; .623¢; 15¢ayard?” In dealing with this topic 
the first words of the eighth book listed in Table XL 
are “What is $ 2.50 with 10 % added? with 20 % added ?”” 
Seven such questions as these, becoming progressively 
more difficult, are presented before the suggestion is 
offered. ‘The per cent of profit or loss is always 
reckoned on the cost of the goods.” Then an example 
(an analyzed problem) is presented. s

\ 
CoNCRETE PROBLEMS OF DIFFERENT PERIODS: ILLUs- 
TRATIONS 
There is still another feature not presented in the fore- 
going table, that is entitled to some consideration. We 
have reference to the changing character of the problems, 
included in the texts. Beginning with Ray’s arithmetic, 
we have selected three of the very first supposedly con- 
crete problems from each of the texts. 
No. 2: — A man owing $ of a ship, sold 4o per cent of his share. 
What part of the ship did he sell and what part did he still own? 
Out of a cask containing 47 gal. 2 qt. 1 pt. leaked 63 per cent. 
How much was that? 
A found $5 which was 133 per cent of what he had before. 
How much had he then? 
No. 4:—A cistern with a capacity of 84 gal. is 413 per cent 
full. How many gallons doés it contain? 
A owed B a certain sum of money. After paying him 20 per 
cent of the debt, 25 per cent of the remainder, 50 per cent of what 
then remained, and 83% per cent of the third remainder, what 
part of the debt was still unpaid? 
In a school of 42 pupils, 7 were in one class, 14 in another, 6 
in a third, 12 in a fourth, and the remainder in a fifth. Give the

CONSTANTS AND VARIABLES IN PERCENTAGE 
A cursory examination of these problems shows that 
the character of problem making has been undergoing 
changes. One feels that when some of the older authors 
wrote their problems down, they must have said, ‘‘ Now 
see if you can get that.’ Problem makers now give 
less attention to the hypothetical disciplinary value 
of problems and more to their social utility. 
Although there has been no tendency whatever to 
increase the absolute space given to this phase of arith- 
metic, the ninth column shows that the actual per cent 
of total book space given to percentage and its applica- 
tions has actually increased from fifteen to thirty-eight. 
As the years have gone by there has been a slight 
decrease in the number of applications treated. The 
 
-P-A-G-E-124
  116 THE SUPERVISION OF ARITHMETIC 
number of rules stated dropped to the minimum about 
fifty years ago. This may be a startling revelation to 
some of those “modern” schoolmasters who have re- 
cently discovered the futility of teaching arithmetic by 
tules. Practically no rules are presented in any of the 
new books, and practically none have been presented in 
half a century. The number of problems, however, has 
“shown a tendency to increase; the number of examples 
has varied irregularly, but the necessity of using them 
seems to be about as pronounced as ever. Oral and con- 
crete problems seem to be increasing, while abstract 
problems (if they may be so named) have practically 
been eliminated. 
Taxes, insurance, and simple interest are the only 
topics that have a place in each of the ten books. 
Gain and loss, commission and brokerage, stocks and 
bonds, duties, bank discount, and compound interest 
and partial payments each appear in eight of the books. 
Commercial discount appears in seven books, and is 
clearly increasing in importance. Of these eleven topics, 
partial payments and compound interest are losing in 
importance; the others may be said to represent the 
constants of this part of the curriculum. Apparently 
there is a persistent demand to retain percentage and its 
applications because of its interpretative rather than 
because of its utilitarian value, for most of these topics 
are not taught for the purpose of making children adept 
 
-P-A-G-E-125

in certain skills. A utilitarian claim may be established 
for interest, but such a claim would hardly be considered 
sufficient to justify the presence of the other subjects. 
Perhaps the query may be made as to how such 
material as this helps a superintendent. It must be 
admitted that this particular study does not supply 
him with definite quantitative standards for the judging 
of textbooks. Perhaps no such standards are possible, 
and, certainly with reference to some aspects of arith- 
metic, they are not desirable. But this study does 
furnish a number of suggestions that should receive 
consideration when textbooks in arithmetic are being 
examined. In the first place it indicates what the 
variables and constants are in percentage. In the second 
place it supplies a rough basis, as indicated by the num- 
ber of problems, for estimating the relative emphasis 
each topic should receive. 
THE SHIFTING CONTENT OF MENSURATION + 
For the purpose of studying some topic intensively 
a second investigation was made,—this time with 
mensuration. Only two things were considered : whether 
there had been any change (1) in content or (2) in 
the relative emphasis of the topics as indicated by 
the amount of space devoted to them. Thirty-one

grammar school texts, ranging according to their dates 
of publication, from 1796 to 1912 were examined. The 
amount of space and the number of problems appearing 
under each of the following topics were checked: Quad- 
rilaterals, including trapezoids, trapeziums, and parallelo-  
-P-A-G-E-129
  
JUDGING TEXTBOOKS 12I 
grams; circles; triangles; prisms; cylinders; pyra- 
mids and cones; spheres, ellipses; similar figures; 
lumber measure; brick and stone measure, and gaug- 
ing of casks. 
The results can be shown more clearly by the graphs 
here given than by the original table. In each instance 
the arithmetic mean of the period is taken as the ordi- 
nate of the period. In Figure I the black line shows the 
number of pages devoted to mensuration, indicated by 
the scale at the left. The red line shows the percentage 
of the total number of pages devoted to mensuration. 
From this figure one can see that mensuration came 
into use in textbooks shortly after 1820 and that it has 
gradually increased in importance until in 1912 about 
twenty-one pages or 8 per cent of the whole book was 
given to it. 
Figure II shows the rather irregular increase in the 
number of miscellaneous mensuration problems appear- 
ing in textbooks. In Figures III to X the black lines 
denote the number of pages, read from the scale to the 
left, and the red linés show the number of problems 
given to each topic. 
Quadrilaterals have gradually risen in importance 
from about one third of a page with two problems to 
three pages with eighteen problems. The trapezium, 
which appeared in the texts about 1845, about ten years 
after the trapezoid, is receiving less attention than the
-P-A-G-E-130
  
  122 THE SUPERVISION OF ARITHMETIC 
trapezoid. Thé parallelogram, which appears in the 
texts about 1825, now receives almost twice the space 
of the trapezium or the trapezoid. From the earliest 
introduction of mensuration, we have had circles, tri- 
angles, cylinders, prisms, pyramids and cones, and 
spheres, and each of these has gradually increased in 
importance. The ellipse, which came in about 1880, 
disappeared about 1900. The study of similar figures 
has slowly increased since 1850. Brick and stone 
measure have disappeared, but lumber measure has 
increased since 1870. Gauging of casks lasted from 
1840 to Ig00. 
A CoMPARISON OF FIVE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
ARITHMETICS 
A critical study of five elementary arithmetics now 
in use was made for the purpose of comparing them as 
to the similarity of their structure. It was presumed 
that uniformities would be readily discoverable and 
that they would furnish the uninitiated with standards 
for estimating the structural character of any elemen- 
tary text in arithmetic. A summary of this analysis is 
presented in Table XLI, the meaning of which becomes 
clear when read thus: Textbook number I contained 273 
pages, 3 chapters, rz topics, 37 lines of footnotes, 228 
explanations, 183 pictures, 1949 examples, 1526 written 
exercises, 905 review problems, 54 definitions, etc.

It will be seen from the above lists that dissimilarity   rather than similarity is the custom. Note, for ex- 
ample, that the number of notes varies from none to 
205, the number of lines of explanations ranges from 37 
to 228, the number of pictures from 29 to 183, the num- 
ber of examples from 335 to 1949, the number of written 
exercises from 526 to 1026, the review problems from 
124 to 905, the number of rules from none to 52, and so 
on. That part ‘of the table which deals with the more 
strictly arithmetical relationships shows that writers of
-P-A-G-E-132
  124 THE SUPERVISION OF ARITHMETIC 
arithmetics are not agreed as to the standards that 
should prevail in the construction of textbooks. Less 
diversity is manifest in those topics that deal with the 
applications of the arithmetical concepts and principles. 
Greater similarity is found when we examine the 
order in which the topics are treated in these books. 
The next table presents this information.

RELATIVE EMPHASIS OF GIVEN Topics 
It will be seen that about the same topics are treated 
and that they are treated in about the same order in 
all of the books. Clearly counting, addition, subtrac-
-P-A-G-E-133
JUDGING TEXTBOOKS 125 
tion, multiplication, division, measurement, and frac- 
tions are the constants; such topics as ratio, Roman 
numerals, analysis, and percentage are variables. 
The next table gives some notion of the relative 
emphasis these topics are receiving in each of the five 
arithmetics. 
It seems to us that the differences are more interest- 
ing than any central tendencies that might be computed, 
for these, after all, would really not be descriptive of 
practice. Considering the fact that the first two books 
on the list are enjoying a wide sale and the others are 
having almost no sale at all, we were disposed to examine 
the first two more closely in the hope that similarities 
may be noticeable. But such an examination was 
futile; it shed almost no light upon the relative values 
of these books. 
A DicTIONARY OF TERMS AND NAMES 
As a final resort, therefore, we had every word in 
the first fifty pages of these books counted and its 
frequency noted. This may appear to be a foolish 
task. But we were really interested in determining 
whether these books are arithmetics or something 
else. It seems logical to assume that an arithmetic 
should fix certain arithmetical terms, principles, or 
concepts. Recurrence or repetition is necessary to 
insure this fixation. If this repetition recurs only very

infrequently, the student, not being familiar with the 
laws of habit formation, will drift aimlessly through the 
subject, spending two or three years acquiring a few 
fundamental skills that should be assured him at the 
outset. 
It was such fundamental propositions as these that 
induced the authors to prepare Table XLIII. An 
examination of the Table gives one certain common 
sense notions as to why some of the books are necessary 
and others failing. It will be observed, for example, 
that Book V gives little attention to explanations, to 
review problems, or to common and decimal fractions. 
While Book IV emphasizes review problems in the 
fundamentals, it does not do so consistently in the 
other operations, and it neglects to give any consider- 
able attention to fractions. Book I is the most consist- 
ent in the emphasis it gives to the various topics. 
In the first fifty pages of these books 94 proper 
names are used 342 times. The names appearing most 
frequently are Ella and Kate, which appear 6 times 
each, Helen 8, Henry 9g, Carl 12, Fred and James 16 
each, Frank 24, Mary 27, and John 4o. There are in 
these same pages 224 words beginning with c, and these 
words are used a total of 1403 times. As a sample of 
the variety of things that may appear under a single 
letter of the alphabet we print two of these tables, —

  132 THE SUPERVISION OF ARITHMETIC 
clearly that there has been no conscious attempt on the 
part of any of these authors to organize their books so 
as to insure the fixation of certain fundamental arith- 
metical expressions. We believe this to be a defect 
common to many arithmetics. 
An ANALYSIS OF GRAMMAR-GRADE TEXTS 
Four current grammar-grade textbooks in arithmetic 
were selected for careful analysis. First of all, each 
text was inspected with a view to finding the particular 
topics included. Second, the number of problems on 
each topic was determined. Third, the number of 
lines of introductory description was counted. Fourth, 
the teaching devices were counted. The texts were 
then compared in order to form an estimate of the de- 
gree of agreement which existed among them. It was 
immediately apparent that there is agreement on the 
part of the writers as to certain topics which are to be 
taught. All of these authors present addition, multi- 
plication, division, subtraction, denominate numbers, 
fractions, percentage, measurement, interest, and the 
like. Two of the authors, however, would use no 
topics under the head of banking and exchange. Three 
had selected no topics under the head of discount. On 
the other hand, one text had selected topics in the field 
of insurance, taxes, public expenditures, transportation, 
and the like. The children in a school system using 
 
-P-A-G-E-141
  
  
JUDGING TEXTBOOKS 133 
one of these textbooks would have access to material 
touching these lines, while children in schools using the 
other texts would be denied the opportunity of coming 
into contact with such topics, unless the teachers or 
supervisor consciously introduced them. It would be 
worth while for each supervisor to make some such 
analysis as this of the textbook that is now being used, 
in order to find whether or not topics of questionable 
value are being presented; and whether important topics 
are being omitted. : 
A further analysis was made of these books in order 
to determine the relative emphasis given to the different 
topics. For example, it was found that the book placing 
the most emphasis upon addition presented five times 
as many problems as the book giving the least emphasis 
to addition. The supervisor should ask himself the 
question: Do the children under instruction in this 
particular instance need the material in the proportion 
indicated by this analysis? Are there too many prob- 
lems, or are there not enough problems? Again, the 
same variation was present in the case in fractions. The 
book placing the most emphasis upon fractions had 
almost five times as many problems as the book giving 
the least emphasis to fractions. What is the cause of 
this variation? Who is right? Do we need hundreds 
of problems in fractions, or do we need a few problems 
only? The supervisor or teacher should know whether
-P-A-G-E-142
    134 THE SUPERVISION OF ARITHMETIC 
or not the textbook in use provides enough problems 
for her particular purpose. Certainly it is an unsafe 
proposition to rely merely upon the textbook makers 
in this particular. 
Again, certain texts make a great point of review 
exercises. One text has sixteen times as many review 
problems as another. To what is this difference due? 
The supervisor or teacher should know the extent to 
which review exercises are profitable for the class under 
instruction. With this variation in emphasis on the text- 
books, it is clearly unwise to rely solely upon a textbook. 
THE ONLY ADEQUATE STANDARDS ARE COMMON-SENSE 
STANDARDS 
The supervisor who is intent upon results in arith- 
metic needs a more secure basis than the foregoing for 
the judging of textbooks. Adequate scientific standards 
for judging textbooks have not been determined. It 
is clear that textbooks should be adopted on the basis of 
what is in them, on the basis of the selection of topics, 
the sequence of topics, and the gradation of the material, 
but fixed and unalterable definitions cannot be deter- 
mined for these items. They will continue to be modi- 
fied in light of shifting social needs. 
It is probable that greater agreement would have 
been found had more books been studied and compared. 
The books studied were chosen because they were be-
-P-A-G-E-143
  
JUDGING TEXTBOOKS 135 
lieved to be representative. They at least warrant the 
assumption that books must continue to be selected 
upon the basis of common-sense standards, and these 
standards usually relate to whether the books are closely 
organized and teachable. Naturally the application of 
such standards may permit the incorporation of much 
obsolete material in the books. This material can be 
eliminated only when other criteria are used for judging 
it. Reference must be made to social conditions to 
determine whether the material in the book is still serv- 
iceable and reference must be made to the personal 
needs of children to determine whether the material 
may be learned most economically. Definite criteria of 
this sort are not available.

  CHAPTER X 
ALGEBRA AND GEOMETRY IN THE GRADES 
THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE COMMITTEE OF TEN 
Tue Committee of Ten, which reported in 1893, rec- 
ommended instruction in algebraic symbols and in simple 
equations. It is also stated “that a child’s geometrical 
education should begin as early as possible. — At the 
age of ten years for the average child systematic in- 
struction in concrete or experimental geometry should 
begin and should occupy one hour per week for at least 
three years.”’ It was not presumed in this report that 
algebra and geometry should appear as separate sub- 
jects, but that they should be taught in connection 
with arithmetic. The recommendations followed closely 
the prevailing practice in Europe. Although consider- 
able opposition has been voiced from time to time to 
this part of the report of the Committee of Ten, many 
mathematicians and superintendents now indorse the 
early introduction and use of algebraic formule and 
certain fundamental concepts of geometry.

ALGEBRA AND GEOMETRY IN THE GRADES 137 
Tue ATTITUDE OF SUPERINTENDENTS WITH REFER- 
ENCE TO THE USE OF ALGEBRAIC SYMBOLS 
The authors, in a recent investigation, sought informa- 
tion from a large number of superintendents in regard 
to this point. 
A little less than half of the superintendents in cities 
of 4000 and over, and more than one hundred county 
superintendents, replied to the queries as to whether 
algebraic symbols should be taught in the grades, and if 
so, in what grades. Their replies appear in the tables. 
Opinions were expressed by seven hundred _ninety- 
five superintendents ; five hundred thirty-nine of whom 
expressed themselves definitely in favor of teaching 
Algebra symbols in the grade. Two hundred forty-one 
expressed themselves definitely as being opposed to the 
teaching of algebraic symbols. Fifteen expressed them- 
selves doubtfully in regard to the issue.

To the left of the dotted line, Table XLVI reads 182 
superintendents out of 290 in the North Central states 
favor instruction in algebra in the grades, 97 are op- 
posed to it, 11 consider it questionable. The figures to 
the right of the dotted line show in what grades these 
superintendents think algebra should be taught. It will 
be observed that the totals to the right of the dotted 
line do not agree with the totals to the left of the dotted 
line. This is due to the fact that a single superintend- 
ent may have indicated that the subject should ap- 
pear in more than one grade, and his reply is conse- 
quently recorded for each of the grades indicated. It 
  would have been possible for each grade in the North 
Central states to have received 182 votes, and so on 
for each of the geographical sections. 
Two thirds of the superintendents advocate the teach-
-P-A-G-E-147
ALGEBRA AND GEOMETRY IN THE GRADES 139 
ing of algebra in some of the grades. Almost one third 
are opposed to instruction in the subject. 
These superintendents testified only with reference 
to the use of algebraic symbols. These tables supply no 
information whatever as to the extent to which definite 
operations like simple equations, simultaneous equations, 
quadratic equations, and the like, are advised. Although 
a small but insignificant number of superintendents ad- 
vocate the use of the symbols in the second, third, fourth, 
fifth, and sixth grades, it is not until the seventh and 
eighth grades are reached that any considerable number 
urge such instruction. 
From Table XLVII, which presents the facts of Table 
XLVI distributed in per cents, it will be seen that more 
than one half of those favoring the introduction of the 
symbols of algebra in the grades maintain that they 
should appear in the seventh grade, and the vote of this 
group is almost unanimous in favor of their use in the 
eighth grade. 
Attention is directed to the fact that the South Central 
and South Atlantic states show a slightly larger per- 
centage of superintendents who favor the use of algebraic 
symbols than do the other sections of the country. 
Thisis of especial interest, as these two groups of adminis- 
trators urge more strongly than the other groups the use 
of the symbols in the lower grades. A large percentage 
of the South Central superintendents mention the sec-
-P-A-G-E-148
  140 THE SUPERVISION OF ARITHMETIC 
ond, third, and fourth grades, and a large percentage of 
the South Atlantic superintendents mention the fifth 
and sixth grades as the grades in which the symbols 
should appear. 
VARIATION IN ATTITUDE OF SUPERINTENDENTS IN 
Crtres OF DIFFERENT SIZES 
The query arises as to whether or not the attitude of 
the superintendents in the large cities is the same as 
that of the superintendents of the small cities. 
These data consequently were distributed again in 
order to reveal differences, if any, in the attitude of the 
superintendents of schools in cities of different size.

    No new facts are revealed for cities of any size by dis- 
tributing the replies on the basis of the grades in which 
the symbols are taught. In the form, however, in which   the material is presented in this part of the table it will 
be easy for the reader to be misled. The totals for the 
grades in Table XLVIII are swelled because some su- 
perintendents specified more than one grade. Again the 
per cents in Table XLIX are based upon the grade dis- 
tribution of Table XLVIII and not upon the 685 su- 
perintendents who replied to the questionnaires. 
While very little of scientific value is known about 
the actual advantage to be gained from the use of alge- 
braic symbols in arithmetic, the working supervisor will 
be inclined to attach significance to the opinion of the

  142 THE SUPERVISION OF ARITHMETIC 
majority of the superintendents throughout the country. 
In the absence of better data, there is some reason for 
this sort of response. 
Mr. Van Houten discovered that only three school 
superintendents out of 148 required the omission of al- 
gebra from the course of study, and that a considerable 
number of them offer one full term of it above the sixth 
grade. 
ALGEBRAIC Topics TAUGHT IN THE GRADES 
Superintendents in a number of typical American 
cities were asked to specify what topics should appear 
in a graded course in algebra. Their replies are listed 
in the following tables :

equations with two unknowns, 53 in addition and sub- 
traction, 49 in fractions, 7 in quadratics. It is also 
shown that 98.9 % of all the cities teaching algebra pro- 
vide instruction in equations with one unknown, 37.5 % 
in equations with two unknown, 55.2 % in addition and 
subtraction, and so on. Sixteen of the schools repre- 
sented, or almost 17%, use separate texts in algebra. 
VIEWS OF PRESENT-DAY WRITERS 
Recent writers on the subject of teaching of arith- 
metic, such as Young, Smith, Brown and Coffman, are 
inclined to favor the use of algebraic symbols. The 
latter writers say: ‘In the latter part of the sixth and 
in the seventh and eighth grades the teacher should not 
hesitate to introduce letters to represent numbers. It 
is no more unnatural, after a short time, for the pupil 
to use ‘C’ to represent the cost, ‘I’ to represent 
interest, ‘V’ to represent volume, and ‘N’ to represent 
a number than for him to use N. Y. to represent New 
York or A.M. to represent the time before noon. The 
pupil should recognize the symbols of algebra as a short- 
hand method of indicating magnitudes. Arithmetic 
does not become algebra by the use of letters instead 
of numbers. The solution of many of the problems of 
common and decimal fractions, or ratio and proportion, 
percentage and mensuration, is greatly simplified and 
abridged by the use of letters for the magnitudes which 
they represent.”

    An examination of the second of these tables leads 
one to suspect that the geometry used is very elementary 
in character. Only two schools use a textbook in this 
field. 
While it can be safely asserted that there is a marked 
tendency to give instruction in the simpler forms of 
algebra in the two upper grades, no such statement can 
be made with reference to geometry.

PROBLEMS RELATED TO CURRENT BUSINESS 
LIFE 
THE ARTICULATION OF SUBJECTS WITH LIFE REDUCES 
WASTE 
In every field of human activity efforts are being made 
to economize time. Usually these efforts result in a 
standardization of the processes employed in carrying 
on the work. Frequently economy of effort is secured 
by the introduction of time and labor saving devices. 
School officers everywhere are sympathetic with the 
movement to secure more satisfactory results in less time, 
but they are not always conscious of the agencies by 
which this may be accomplished. Certainly one means 
at the disposal of every superintendent for improving 
the efficiency of his schools is that of reconstructing the 
internal organization of the schools. Heretofore superin- 
tendents have devoted much of their time and energy 
to this problem, because it was close at hand and they 
could readily see the beneficial results that they were 
securing by the reorganizations they adopted. Im- 
L 145
-P-A-G-E-154
  146 THE SUPERVISION OF ARITHMETIC 
portant as details of management and of organization 
are, they are entitled to no more consideration and are 
of no more importance in removing unnecessary waste 
and friction than are the adjustments of the school to 
shifting social and industrial conditions. Just to the 
extent that a proper articulation can be made between 
the materials of the school and those social situations 
which they represent, waste may be avoided. 
THE EVOLUTION OF SUBJECTS OF STUDY 
It is a fact that every subject of study had a long 
period of preconscious evolution before it was consciously 
formulated. During this time the race was discovering 
that some of its experiences had a similarity and that 
these experiences were of service in securing adjustments 
of alike character. Obviously some of these experiences 
were transient in character and were soon forgotten. 
Others occurred so frequently and with such intensity 
and touched the lives of so many people that they were 
considered as vital and necessary to the lives of all the 
people. These experiences were saved, and many of 
them were eventually incorporated in the various sub- 
jects of study. Each subject of study, therefore, rep- 
resents a special attempt at environmental adjust- 
ment. Each subject of study should give one control 
over some special phase of his environment. Now the 
unfortunate thing is that many teachers forget the con-
-P-A-G-E-155
  
PROBLEMS RELATED TO CURRENT BUSINESS LIFE 147 
crete situations that gave rise to the experiences that are 
incorporated in any particular study and teach the sub- 
ject as if it were an end in itself instead of a means to 
an end. Since each subject is merely a series of related 
problems, it should be taught not only to show its in- 
tegrity, but so that its facts and processes may function 
in situations outside the school that are similar to those 
that gave rise to the materials included within the 
subject. 
There is no subject that has suffered more in this par- 
ticular than arithmetic. Teachers have been clinging to 
obsolete phases of the subject, 7.e., to aspects that are no 
longer used in the business world, with the hope that 
they might still be socially serviceable. Some teachers, 
however, have justified the retention of certain divisions 
of the subject on disciplinary grounds; for example, 
the Euclidean method of finding the greatest common 
divisor. It is doubtful whether any one should argue 
for the retention of any subject in the curriculum purely 
on the ground of its mind-training value, and yet every 
one desires that the mind be trained. Surely the mind 
will get as much training from exercise upon materials 
that are useful as from exercise upon materials that 
are no longer useful. It is for this very reason that 
textbook makers in the field of arithmetic and superin- 
tendents are eliminating much of the material that the 
business world has ceased to use. Such topics as the 
 
-P-A-G-E-156
  148 THE SUPERVISION OF ARITHMETIC 
greatest common divisor and the least common multiple 
(when numbers are not readily factorable), obsolete 
tables in denominate numbers, troy weight, apothecary 
weight, circulating decimals, cube root, progressions, 
compound proportion, and the like have disappeared or 
are disappearing from our textbooks and courses in 
arithmetic. 
Dancers INHERENT IN THE LOCALIZATION OF 
SuBjEcT MATTER 
, Believing that modern social theory had affected the 
opinions of school superintendents everywhere with 
reference to whether time could be saved by relating the 
problems in arithmetic more closely to industries, occu- 
pations, and the like, a series of questions were sub- 
mitted to them bearing upon this point. We realize 
that there are certain dangers in attempting to make 
such adjustments. No school curriculum should be 
completely localized, for the reason that many of those 
trained in any particular community will live else- 
where. Moreover, localized school curriculums would 
accentuate differences between communities. It seems 
to us that the primary purpose of the elementary school 
is to increase the homogeneity of our general population. 
On the other hand, the children should see that the 
material included in arithmetic is of service in carrying 
on the work of the community.
-P-A-G-E-157
  PROBLEMS RELATED TO CURRENT BUSINESS LIFE 149 
THE VALUE OF THE SOCIALIZATION OF ARITHMETIC 
There are some phases of arithmetic that are needed 
in practically all industries and occupations in every 
part of the country. These are the things which should 
receive the greatest emphasis. Seven hundred and 
sixty-two superintendents furnished testimony as to 
whether or not time can be saved by securing a closer 
correlation between the subject matter of arithmetic 
and the situations in which it is supposed to function. 
The first two tables show how these answers were dis- 
tributed. It will be noted that 551 or 72.3% of those 
replying were of the opinion that waste could be reduced 
by such an arrangement. As a matter of fact this total 
should be increased by 9.3%, as 71 additional indi- 
viduals, although a little uncertain, really belong in the 
affirmative column. It will be noted that about 13% 
were of the opinion that nothing could be gained by 
such a procedure. The greatest conservatism was shown 
by the superintendents of the North Central and the 
North Atlantic states, — where less than 70% main- 
tained that time may be saved in this way; but the 
difference between these geographical areas and the 
other sections of the United States is not so great as it 
seems, for it will be noted that 10.4% in the North 
Central and 9.7% in the North Atlantic states thought 
that time might be saved by increasing the reality and 
concreteness of the problems.

Important variations in practice are not discoverable 
until the replies of superintendents are distributed for 
the different-sized cities, irrespective of their location. 
  But when this is done, it is not clear that one group of 
cities is more progressive or conservative than another 
group of cities. It is true that variations occur, but it 
seems that superintendents of small cities are no more 
likely to maintain that the proper way of increasing
-P-A-G-E-159

efficiency in arithmetic is by increasing the social char- 
acter of the material than are superintendents of large 
cities. At any rate these tables are descriptive of a 
tendency that is characteristic of every section of the 
United States and of superintendents of every sized city.

152 THE SUPERVISION OF ARITHMETIC 
Tue SoctAL CHARACTER OF THE MATERIAL IN THE 
INDIANAPOLIS COURSE OF STUDY 
Many courses of study show a tendency on the part 
of supervisors to reconstruct the course in arithmetic in 
accordance with social and business demands. One of 
the most noteworthy of these is the Indianapolis course of 
study in which there is a special attempt at supplement- 
ing the arithmetic of the seventh and eighth grades with 
community problems. The problems outlined for the 
7 A grade deal with the grocery, meat market, the de- 
partment store, lumber dealers, the cost of heating and 
lighting the home, the cost of furnishings for the home, 
saving money, banking, interest, real estate, and the 
loaning of money. In addition to these the eighth-grade 
list includes problems referring to the dairy and milk 
department, fire department, city market, city hospital, 
library, street construction, transportation, insurance, 
stocks and bonds. In every instance these problems are 
directly related to local conditions. It could not, how- 
ever, be maintained that the training that the student 
. is getting in the solution of these problems would be of 
no service to him elsewhere, as Indianapolis is a typical 
American city. The. cost of food, clothing, and furnish- 
ings, and the agencies that may be used for the saving 
of money are very much the same everywhere. 
Indianapolis authorities have merely taken advantage
-P-A-G-E-161
PROBLEMS RELATED TO CURRENT BUSINESS LIFE 153 
of local conditions for the purpose of teaching arithmetic 
facts and problems that people universally need. Such 
a device is calculated not only to increase the interest of 
students in arithmetic, but to insure the fixation of cer- 
tain fundamental phases of the subject. The students 
are encouraged to make original problems and to observe 
that arithmetic plays an important part in their daily 
life and in that of the community in general. We are 
of the opinion that such a device as this economizes time 
and energy, because it rationalizes the processes and 
because the students are immediately conscious of the 
recurrence of their arithmetical experiences in the world 
outside.

  CHAPTER XII 
TESTS AND RESULTS AS SHOWN BY SPECIAL 
INVESTIGATIONS \ 
A COMPARISON OF THE ARITHMETICAL EFFICIENCY OF 
To-DAY WITH THAT OF THE PAST 
THE SPRINGFIELD TESTS 
WITHIN recent years there has been much discussion 
in regard to the results attained under present-day con- 
ditions in the teaching of arithmetic as compared with 
the work of earlier days. For the most part the discus- 
sion has confined itself to statements of opinion or proof 
by isolated examples. 
However, if a supervisor wishes to compare the work 
of a particular school of to-day with that of a particular 
school of the past, means are available. 
A few years ago a set of examination questions with 
the papers and their markings, which were given in the 
Springfield, Massachusetts, schools in 1846, were dis- 
covered. The examination was given to eighty-five 
pupils in the ninth grade. The average marking of the 
class of 1846 was 29.4 per cent. In 1905 the eighth- 
grade class in Springfield, Massachusetts, averaged 65.5 
154  
-P-A-G-E-163
  
TESTS AND RESULTS 155 
per cent. The Springfield questions in arithmetic have 
been given in many cities since they were brought to 
light. In practically all instances the children of to-day 
have attained a higher rank than the children in 1846. 
In Frankfort, Indiana, the class averaged 62.2 per cent; 
in Albia, Iowa, the class averaged 74.5 per cent. The 
questions are as follows: 
1. Add together the following numbers: Three thousand and 
nine, twenty-nine, one, three hundred and one, sixty-one, sixteen, 
seven hundred and two, nine thousand, nineteen and a half, one 
and a half. 
2. Multiply 10,008 by 8009. 
3.. Ina town five miles wide and six miles long, how many acres? 
4, How many steps of two and a half feet each will a person 
take in walking one mile? 
5. What is one third of 1753? 
6. A boy bought three dozen of oranges for 373 cents, and 
sold them for 13 cents apiece. What would he have gained if he 
had sold them for 23 cents apiece? 
“7. There is a certain number, one third of which exceeds one 
fourth of it by two. What is the number? 
8. What is the simple interest of $ 1200 for 12 years, 11 months, 
and 29 days, at six per cent? 
THE PIONEER INVESTIGATION 
In 1902, Dr. J. M. Rice,! who had earlier interested 
himself in testing the results secured in other subjects, 
1J. M. Rice, Scientific Management in Education. Hinds, Noble, 
& Eldredge. New York, 1903.
-P-A-G-E-164
  156 THE SUPERVISION OF ARITHMETIC 
gave a test to 6000 grammar-grade children distributed 
through eighteen school buildings in seven cities. He 
examined each of the pupils in the fourth, fifth, sixth, 
seventh, and eighth grades by means of eight examples. 
Concerning these examples, Dr. Rice says, “In prepar- 
ing my questions, I endeavored to arrange them in a 
way that would suit the individual grades of all schools, 
regardless of the-methods or systems employed. From 
this standpoint I was successful, excepting that in a very 
few instances two of the examples were beyond the scope 
of the pupils in the first half of the fourth year, because 
they had not yet learned to multiply or divide with 
figures above twelve, and in the first half of the seventh 
year, where the classes had not yet had much practice 
in percentage. These points were carefully noted; 
but when the papers were marked, it was found that the 
effect upon the entire school average would not in any 
case exceed 2 per cent. I wish to add, furthermore, that 
for the purpose of studying the growth of mental power 
from year to year, some of the problems were carried 
through several grades. Thus, of the eight questions 
for the fourth grade, five were repeated in the fifth and 
three in the sixth, etc. Moreover, this repetition will 
enable us to see not only, for instance, how the results 
in the fifth and sixth grades, in regard to certain prob- 
lems, compare with those of the fourth in the same school, 
but also how the results in the fourth grade of some
-P-A-G-E-165
  
TESTS AND RESULTS 157 
schools compare in these examples with those of the 
later grades of others, etc. 
“The problems for each were as follows:

          Mr. Rice found great variation in the reaction of 
pupils to these questions. The variability was even 
greater in the advanced grades than in the earlier 
grades. In the seventh grade the class averages ranged 
from as low as 8.9 per cent to as high as 81.1 per cent, 
and in the eighth grade the range was from 11.3 per 
cent to 91.7 per cent. Not only were the extremes 
M 
 
-P-A-G-E-170
162 THE SUPERVISION OF ARITHMETIC 
widely separated, but “the averages for schools taken 
as a whole varied between 25 and 80 per cent.” ‘ 
While it is true that wide variation was found in each 
school, yet Mr. Rice found that the performance of the 
different schools in the same city were highly similar; 
that is to say, if one school in a system ranked high, all 
the other schools in the system showed a similar ranking, 
and if one school ranked low, the system probably ranked 
low. Concerning the causes of the differences in per- 
formance, Mr. Rice proposes that ‘‘two factors must be 
taken into consideration: first, the influence of the 
teaching; and, secondly, the resistance against that 
“influence due to circumstances over which the teacher 
has no direct control... . Analysis of the problem 
will show that the essential elements of which it is com- 
posed (resistance) do not exceed three in number: (1) 
the home environment of the pupils; (2) the size of 
the classes; and (3) the average age of the children.” 
After Mr. Rice’s detailed study of the specific effect of 
each of these factors, he says: “A study of the figures . . . 
will show conclusively that the influence of all these fac- 
tors has been very much exaggerated, and, therefore, that 
the cause of unfavorable results must be sought, largely 
at least, on the pedagogical side.... That is to say, 
the school laboring under the poorest conditions in 
respect to home environment obtained a better standing 
than any one of the so-called aristocratic schools. . . .
-P-A-G-E-171
TESTS AND RESULTS 163 
Equally surprising, if indeed not more incredible, may 
appear the statement that no allowance whatever is to 
be made for the size of the class in judging the results 
of my tests. ... The number of pupils per class was 
larger in the highest six schools than it was in the schools 
of City VI, and the classes were exceptionally small 
in the school that stands at the lower end.... A 
glance at the ages will show that the average age of 
the pupils of the schools that showed the best results 
was about five months higher than that of the pupils 
of the schools that did the poorest.... But the 
factor of age may be completely eliminated by compar- 
ing the results of a given grade of the successful schools 
with those of a higher grade of the unsuccessful ones. 
These facts certainly constitute a striking blow 
at the theory of those who believe that arithmetic is a 
matter of natural evolution.” 
Mr. Rice, in the further analysis of the factors affect- 
ing the efficiency of the arithmetical performances of 
the children on the basis of the time expenditure, stated 
the following conclusions: ‘“‘A glance at the figures will 
tell us at once that there is no direct relation between 
time and results; that special pressure does not neces- 
sarily lead to success, and conversely, that lack of pres- 
sure does not necessarily mean failure. 
“Tn the first place, it is interesting to note that the 
amount of time devoted to arithmetic in the school that
-P-A-G-E-172
  164. THE SUPERVISION OF ARITHMETIC 
obtained the lowest average, 25 per cent, was practi- 
cally the same as it was in the one where the highest 
average, 80 per cent, was obtained. From these few 
facts two important deductions may be made: first, 
that the unsatisfactory results cannot be accounted for 
on the ground of insufficient instruction; and, secondly, 
that the school showing the favorable results cannot be 
accused of having made a fetich of arithmetic.” 
The supervisor is especially interested in the analysis 
which Mr. Rice makes of the pedagogical aspects of the 
problem. He discusses this from two points of view: 
first, the part played by the teacher; and secondly, 
the part played by the supervisor. Concerning the 
former he says: “The elements brought into play by 
the teacher, though numerous, may be, for practical 
purposes, resolved into three primary factors: 
“ 1. The time devoted to arithmetic ; 
“2. The methods of instruction; and 
“3. Teaching ability, as represented by a combina- 
tion of education, training, and the personality of the 
teacher.” 
Concerning the time element, Mr. Rice, in addition 
to the results presented earlier in this chapter, says: 
“Tn view of the results and of my interview with prin- 
cipals and teachers, I feel confident that home-work 
in arithmetic means a tax upon the time and energy of 
the pupil, for which he receives very meager, if any, 
 
-P-A-G-E-173
  
TESTS AND RESULTS 105 
compensation. Consequently, I wish to add to my 
suggestions, as to the amount of time to be appor- 
tioned to arithmetic, that the forty-five minutes daily 
should stand for the ‘preparation and recitation com- 
bined. ; 
“Secondly, methods of teaching can certainly not be looked 
upon as the controlling element. . . . In the schools that passed 
my test satisfactorily no special methods had been in use... . 
Thoroughness is, undoubtedly, one of the secrets of success. 
“Variations in the results cannot be accounted for by the dif- 
ferences in the general qualities of the teacher. Few will take 
exception to the statement that marked individual variations 
will be found among the members of every corps of teachers: 
Therefore, if general ability were the controlling factor, the ex- 
treme variations in results should be found in the different class- 
rooms of the same locality. But this condition does not appear 
in the table, where it is shown that in certain localities practically 
all the results were good, while in certain other cities practically 
all the results were poor.” 
Thus Mr. Rice disposes of the factors of time, methods 
of instruction, and special teaching ability; his con- 
clusion being that the variability in results does not 
parallel variability in these factors. He next attempts 
to analyze the results of the test with a view of deter- 
mining the effect of their supervisory factors. Con- 
cerning this he says: ‘The facts have led me to believe 
that it is here that the controlling factor lies. My 
conviction is based on the circumstance that, in every 
instance, a variation in the results appears to accord 
 
-P-A-G-E-174
  166 THE SUPERVISION OF ARITHMETIC 
with a variation in a special phase of the supervision. 
If my interpretation of the facts is correct, we are 
forced to conclude that the results secured in the average 
classroom do not represent the powers of the average 
teacher, but the response to what is expected of her; 
so that, ultimately, the problem of results becomes a 
‘question of demand and supply. And my deduction 
is this, that the teachers will supply what their super- 
visors demand, provided the demand be placed within 
reasonable bounds.”’ 
Mr. Rice differentiated the functions of the super- 
intendent under five heads: 
1. The preparation of the course of study ; 
2. The apportionment of time to the individual subjects ; 
3. Offering suggestions to teachers, during meetings and visits, 
as to methods of teaching and the treatment of children; 
4. The establishment of demands in regard to results; and 
5. The testing for results to see whether the teachers are living 
up to these demands. 
After analyzing the varying factors, Mr. Rice made 
the following generalization: “The controlling factor 
in the accomplishment of results is to be found in the 
system of examinations employed, some systems lead- 
ing to better results than others. . . . The controlling 
element lies, therefore, in that form of examination 
which is intended as a test of the teacher’s progress.” 
These tests were classified as follows:
-P-A-G-E-175
  
TESTS AND RESULTS ; 167 
1. Tests made from time to time by the teachers themselves. 
Each teacher formulates her own questions, marks the papers of 
her own class, and submits the results to the superintendent ; but 
no tests are made by principal or superintendent. 
2. Tests made in the same way by the teachers; but the 
teachers’ tests are supplemented from time to time by those of 
the superintendent. 
3. Tests made from time to time by the principals, each 
principal formulating the questions for his own school. The 
results are reported to the superintendent, but the latter does 
not make any tests of his own. 
4. The same system of testing by the principals; but the 
principals’ tests are supplemented from time to time by those 
of the superintendent. 
Of those foregoing classes of tests, Mr. Rice selects 
the fourth as being the system best calculated to attain 
a high standard of efficiency. 
The supervisor of the teaching of arithmetic finds 
much in the investigation of Mr. Rice to encourage 
closer supervision in the teaching: of arithmetic. His 
conclusions to the effect that results are more directly 
traceable to the supervisor’s activity than to any other 
one cause, are of great significance not only to the 
superintendent but also to the teacher. Supervisors will 
do well to experiment definitely with the different types 
of tests which Mr. Rice proposes. It may be readily 
seen that one of the most difficult problems is that of 
determining the standard of results which are to be 
demanded of children in the different grades.  
-P-A-G-E-176
  168 THE SUPERVISION OF ARITHMETIC 
ABILITIES OF CHILDREN IN THE 6A GRADE IN THE 
FUNDAMENTALS AND ALSO IN REASONING 
Dr. C. W. Stone? in 1908 gave the same test under 
as nearly uniform conditions as possible to children in the 
6A grade distributed throughout twenty-six different 
cities in the United States. Some of the exercises were 
so planned as to test the ability of children in the 
fundamental operations. The other part of the ex- 
amination tested the reasoning ability of the children. 
A time limit of twelve minutes was given for the 
solution of the fundamental problems, and fifteen 
minutes for the reasoning problems. The list of prob- 
lems in each case was so long as to make it impossible 
for any student to solve all of them in the time given. 
Each child had a chance to do all he could in the time 
allotted. Ordinarily, examinations are arranged in 
such a way as to enable the bright pupil to finish his 
work before the time is up, and as a consequence it is 
never known just how much more that pupil could have 
done in the time allotted had he worked at his maxi- 
mum speed. On the other hand, the slow pupil finds it 
impossible to finish. In other words, the ordinary 
examination tends to conceal the extreme range of va- 
riation which actually exists in the ordinary class. It 
is as though we were to announce that every one of a

given group should run a hundred yards in fourteen 
seconds. Swift runners would cover the distance in 
less than fourteen seconds, but slow runners would re- 
quire a longer time. 
Dr. Stone scored all the papers alike. The reliability 
of system of scoring used was checked up by a prelimi- 
nary test. : . 
Interest at once attaches to the results attained by 
the 6A children in the different cities. The fact that 
children in the same grade, distributed throughout the 
different cities, were tested by the same person, using the 
same questions, with the same time limit, and the same 
system of scoring, enables Dr. Stone to compare the 
arithmetical ability of the children in the different cities. 
It also enabled him to compare the results in one city 
with those in another city. Comparisons of this sort are 
of very great value for supervisory purposes. While 
they do not supply the supervisor with a remedy when 
he discovers that his schools are far above or far below 
the achievement of other schools, the comparisons at 
least reveal the place that requires a more careful study 
and diagnosis. As a matter of fact these comparisons 
did turn the attention of Dr. Stone to the study of the 
curriculum, methods of instruction, and supervisory 
helps for an explanation of the variation. 
The following table shows the ranking of the different 
systems, the range of variability of the systems as a whole.

It is important to note the wide range of ability dis- 
played. The supervisor is at once concerned as to the 
possible cause for the wide range of performance by 
children in the same grade. The supervisor asks, Is 
 
-P-A-G-E-180
  172 THE SUPERVISION OF ARITHMETIC 
this due to difference in time allotment, to difference 
in method, to difference in material, to difference in 
children, or to difference in supervision ? 
Dr. Stone distributed his data so as to show the rela- 
tionship which existed between achievement in arith- 
metic and time allotment. His conclusion follows: 
For these systems it is evident that there is practically no 
relation between time expenditure and arithmetical abilities ; 
and, in view of the representative nature of these twenty-six 
systems, it is probable that this lack of relationship is the rule 
the country over. This is not to say that a certain amount of 
time is not essential to the production of arithmetical abilities; 
nor that, given the same other factors, operating equally well, 
the product will not increase somewhat with an increased time 
expenditure. What is claimed is that, as present practice goes, a 
large amount of time spent on arithmetic is no guarantee of a 
high degree of efficiency. If one were to choose at random among 
the schools with more than the median time given to arithmetic, 
the chances are about equal that he would get a school with an 
inferior product, and conversely, if one were to choose among the 
schools with less than the median time cost, the chances are about 
equal that he would get a school with a superior product in arith- 
metic. 
Dr. Stone also attempted to compare the rankings of 
the performance of the 6A children with the rankings 
of the courses of study. So far as he was able to deter- 
mine, there seemed to be little if any relation between 
these. This investigation corroborates that of Mr. 
Rice to the effect that the most important factor in
-P-A-G-E-181
  TESTS AND RESULTS 173 
attaining efficiency in arithmetic is that of close super- 
vision of the teacher. 
With reference to the relationships existing between 
the different abilities measured, Dr. Stone says: ‘It 
seems safe to say tentatively of the fundamentals that 
the possession of ability in addition is the least guarantee 
of the possession of ability in others; that the posses- 
sion of ability in multiplication is the best guarantee of 
the possession in others; and that this probably means 
that multiplication is like addition on its mechanical 
side and like division on its thinking side. Hence, 
if it is desired to measure abilities in fundamentals 
by a single test, one in multiplication would be best; 
and a test in division would probably be the best single 
measure of arithmetical ability.” All of which tends 
to confirm the thesis proposed by Thorndike and others ; 
namely, that there is no such thing as general ability 
in arithmetic. The fact that a child is able to do one 
thing in arithmetic is no guarantee that he can do other 
things that are apparently very similar. In other 
words, a supervisor of the teaching of arithmetic cannot 
be satisfied until he knows the degree of proficiency 
which each child possesses in each of the desired arith- 
metical abilities. 
Many supervisors have been interested in applying 
the same tests to their own 6 A grade children. For the

ADDITIONAL TESTS FOR FUNDAMENTALS AND 
REASONING 
Superintendent Giles! of Richmond, Indiana, pre- 
pared a series of simple tests or formule by which any 
teacher might at any time measure, within reasonable 
limits, the ability of any school or pupil in the funda- 
mentals of arithmetic and in reasoning power with 
abstract numbers. The object of the tests or formule, 
according to Superintendent Giles, is to determine the 
average percentage of accuracy, together with a meas- 
ure of the variation in the various fundamental opera- 
tions and in reasoning. 
The conditions under which the proposed tests are 
to be given are as follows:

1. Time for each test, from four to five minutes. 
2. The tests are to be previously written on the blackboard, 
plainly, in a good light, and covered by a screen or curtain until 
the tests begin. 
3. The tests are to be arranged in rows and columns, each 
row containing ten problems and a sufficient number of rows 
given to supply more problems than can be worked by any pupil 
in the time allowed. 
4. Pupils write on papers previously prepared in cross-sections 
ten. wide to correspond with the arrangement of problems on the 
board. ‘ ; 
6. All pupils to begin writing, giving answers only, as soon as _ 
the curtain is drawn and continue until curtain falls. 
6. The numbers composing the test to be drawn by the teacher 
by lot in the following manner: Fifty strips of paper are pre- 
pared of uniform size, on each of which is written at regular 
intervals the natural series of digits omitting o and 1. These 
strips are then cut into pieces of uniform size, each containing 
a digit of the series 2-9. These digits are then placed in a bag 
and drawn one by one, as needed in formulating the test. This 
arrangement insures an equal number of each of the digits to 
draw from. Zero and 1 are omitted to avoid the possibility of 
chance combinations of exceptional ease of solution. Tests four 
minutes long and over, formed in this way, would vary but slightly 
in the degree of difficulty. 
7. Where a chance drawing would result in an absurdity, as 
in the subtraction of a larger from a smaller number, the order 
of the last two digits drawn should be reversed. 
8. The operation to be tested in each exercise is to be explained 
to the class by the teacher before drawing the curtain. It should 
also be written above the test as well as indicated by placing the 
digits in the position usually adopted for performing the various 
N

operations, i.e.,one above the other, with a line below in addition, 
subtraction, and multiplication and the usual arrangement for 
short division, omitting all the operation signs +, —, X, +. 
9. Pupils may grade and mark their own papers, which should 
be checked later by the teacher. From these marks the average 
or median accomplishment of the school can be quickly obtained 
and a measure of the variation easily derived. 
The subject matter of the proposed tests is as follows : 
(1) Addition in single combinations, also double column with 
two figures in column. 
(2) The same arrangement for subtraction. 
(3) Multiplication in which both factors are single digits, also 
when the multiplicand is composed of two digits. 
(4) Short division in which the divisor is a single digit and the 
dividend two, also with three digits in the dividend. 
The reasoning tests include (1) three-quantity one-step abstract 
problems and (2) four-quantity two-step problems. 
The formule may be expressed by letters which are to be re- 
placed with the digits drawn from the bag. Two letters written 
together mean a number of two digits, not multiplication as in 
algebra.

TESTS AND RESULTS 181 
The order in which the reasoning problems are given 
is also to be determined by lot, two or more sets being 
used if necessary to provide sufficient problems for the 
time allowed. 
It will be observed that the tests are inexpensive, 
easily manipulated, and readily interpreted. As yet, 
however, they are of little value for comparing one school 
or one grade with another, for they have not been 
adequately standardized. Their ultimate standardiza- 
tion will require that a number of superintendents in 
different parts of the country coéperate in giving them 
and in sending the results to some common clearing 
house for tabulation. The standards derived may then 
be utilized in determining the relative station of any 
individual, class, or school. It will be better, and in 
the long run far more economical, for tests of this sort 
to receive a universal trial than for a multitude of new 
ones to be constructed. We can hasten the day when 
definite standards will supplant opinion by duplicating 
the work of others in enough places to make the results 
universally valid. 
EXPERIMENT ON Way oF GAINING FACILITY IN THE 
Use or THE MULTIPLICATION TABLES 
Supervisors have been more or less seriously interested 
in a more economical way of teaching children the 
multiplication tables. Many ways have heen proposed, 
 
-P-A-G-E-190
    182 THE SUPERVISION OF ARITHMETIC 
varying from that of having the children “stay in” 
after school in order to write the tables a given number 
of times, to that of teaching the tables purely inciden- 
tally. There have been very few experiments performed 
calculated to throw any light on this problem. 
Mr. E. A. Kirkpatrick of the State Normal School 
at Fitchburg, Massachusetts, published! in 1914 an 
interesting experiment bearing upon this problem. In 
his study he recognized three characteristic ways of 
learning the tables: first, having the children memorize 
the multiplication tables in the traditional way ;. second, 
having the children placed in possession of a multiplica- 
tion sheet which they could use as they needed, with the 
hope that after using it awhile, they would remember 
the combinations well enough so that they would be 
able to “work” the problems without the use of the 
sheet. He proposed as a third method that each child 
be taught to derive multiplication combinations from a 
knowledge of the combinations in addition, — “figure 
out each combination as he needed it.” 
As Mr. Kirkpatrick dealt with students in the Normal 
School who already knew the multiplication tables, he 
experimented upon the different ways of learning a new 
set of products, ‘‘of seven by the prime numbers from 
17 to 53, inclusive, and the experiment was conducted 
1E. A. Kirkpatrick, ‘‘ An Experiment on Memorizing vs. Incidental 
Learning.” Journal of Educational Psychology, Vol. V., pp. 405-413.
-P-A-G-E-191
  
TESTS AND RESULTS" 183, 
to determine the relative advantage of three methods 
of learning these combinations. A practice sheet or 
test sheet was prepared containing the prime numbers 
above named with a smaller figure seven beneath them 
arranged in 10 lines of 1o such groups of figures each. 
Another sheet, known as the key sheet, indicated the 
products that could be substituted for each group of 
numbers. In two methods of testing the pupils were 
not informed that the numbers on the key sheet were 
products, and the majority of them did not discover 
the fact, and very few of those who did made use of 
their knowledge.” 
Mr. Kirkpatrick then experimented upon two classes 
of young men in the normal school. After a preliminary 
test, one group practiced while the other group memo- 
rized for four or five days and then began practicing, 
using the key sheet if they needed it. 
On the tenth day of the experiment, the fifth or sixth day of 
practice for the memorizers, their record of 17.2 seconds was 
slower than the fifth or sixth grade of practice for the practicers 
by 3.1 seconds. 
After an interval of about three weeks, during which nothing 
was done with the experiment, a final test was given. In this 
test they wrote as many products as possible without the key 
sheet in two minutes. The memory group wrote on an average 
of 40.9 answers, and the practicing group 46.2. It appears, there- 
fore, that from every point of view the results averaged better 
for the practice group than for the memory group. 
The next test was tried with two classes of freshmen normal
-P-A-G-E-192
184 THE SUPERVISION OF ARITHMETIC 
school students of about 25 each, all of them young ladies except 
four. One class practiced, using the key as previously described, 
for eight days, while the other had no key, but multiplied the 
numbers and wrote the answers as rapidly as possible the same 
number of days. In the final test the average number of answers 
written in two minutes by the group practicing with the key was 
25.4, while the computing group wrote 44.3 answers. The best 
of those practicing with the key were nearly, but not quite, as 
good as the best in the computing group, but only one wrote fifty 
or more answers and six not over twenty, while in the group that 
computed seven wrote fifty or more and only one less than twenty. 
Those who had memorized the key were helpless in the final 
efficiency test. Only two or three knew they could get the answers 
by multiplying. Those in the computing group were perfectly at 
home and only a little slower than those who incidentally memo- 
rized the final products. 
Mr. Kirkpatrick experimented in a similar way with 
children, but owing to an epidemic, the conditions were 
not quite under control. However, Mr. Kirkpatrick 
made the following conclusions : 
The result in the final efficiency test of two minutes was that 
‘the number of products written by the computers was 27.7; 
by the practicers, 19.1; by the fifth-grade memorizers, 10.1, and 
by the sixth-grade memorizers and practicers, 27.4. 
While Mr. Kirkpatrick does not maintain that his 
experiments are conclusive, yet he does feel that they 
are highly suggestive. He says that “it seems that 
memorizing apart from use is the poorest method of all, 
drill in using somewhat better, while the method of 
using previous knowledge as a guide in practice is the
-P-A-G-E-193
  TESTS AND RESULTS 185 
best of the three. The results indicate that in many 
lines of teaching there has been a tremendous waste 
of time, energy, and interest in first memorizing, then 
later practicing, the use of what has been learned. 
Also that pupils do better when practice is guided by 
their own knowledge than when it is directed by author- 
ity of book or teacher. It is probable that at least a 
year in numbers is wasted in special drill on the various 
combinations beyond what would be necessary if em- 
phasis were first placed on learning how to compute 
tables, than upon working examples and problems with 
larger numbers, computing products till they were 
learned incidentally. This last statement has, of 
course, not been proved experimentally, but is merely 
an opinion based on inference from general principles 
and on a good deal of personal observation. Just how 
much time could be saved by the use of computation 
and incidental methods in number work as compared 
with memorizing and special drill methods is not known, 
but there can be no doubt that there is no need to have 
children memorize any tables.” 
PRACTICE IN THE CASE OF SCHOOL CHILDREN 
Two experiments, one in addition and the other 
in division, were made by Dr. T. J. Kirby! with 1350

-P-A-G-E-194
  186 THE SUPERVISION OF ARITHMETIC 
children in the schools .of the Children’s Aid Society, 
New York City. The work with addition was given 
to classes in the fourth year of the elementary schools; 
the division, to classes in the last half of the third year 
and the first half of the fourth year. Thorndike’s 
“Addition Sheets” and the “Remainder Division 
Tables” were used as a basis for the practice. These 
addition sheets, seven in number, each contain 48 
columns of one-place numbers so arranged that any 
successive five columns are of nearly equal difficulty. 
The division combinations used include the entire 
series from “20 = — 3’s and — remainder” up to 
“89 = — 9’s and — remainder,” thus involving not 
only the combinations which are the inverse of the 
multiplication tables through 9 times 9g, but also the 
division of the intervening series of numbers which 
give a remainder in the answer. 
After an initial practice period of fifteen minutes, 
each class practiced the addition columns for forty-five 
minutes and then received a final test of fifteen minutes 
in length. The first and last practice or tests served 
as bases for determining the change in ability for each 
individual measured. The intervening practice of forty- 
five minutes between initial practice period and the final 
practice period was broken up for different groups of 
classes in four different ways. For Group I it was divided 
into two practice periods of 223 minutes each ; for Group
-P-A-G-E-195
ne eee eee Re Mp me a ee 
TESTS AND RESULTS 187 
II, into three practice periods of fifteen minutes each; 
and for Group III, into eight practice periods, seven 
of six minutes each and one of three minutes; for 
Group IV, into twenty-two practice periods, twenty-one 
of two minutes each and one of three minutes. The 
following table makes the plan clear:

A similar plan was used in the division experiment. 
Each class had an initial practice period of ten minutes 
and a final period of ten minutes; and the intervening 
practice of ‘40 minutes was divided in three different 
ways. In the division, as in the addition, the initial 
and final practice periods were identical in character 
with the intervening’ practice periods; but besides 
serving as practice periods, they served as measures of 
ability at the beginning and end of practice from which 
any change in ability was measured. The first group had 
four intervening practice periods of twenty minutes each ; 
a second group had four intervening practice periods of 
ten minutes each; a third group had twenty intervening 
practice periods of two minutes each. The following 
tabular statement presents the plan for each group:

The pupils were encouraged to do their best, to work 
as fast as they could without making mistakes. Their 
papers were collected at the close of each practice and 
scored in a uniform manner, each column in addition 
and each quotient and remainder in division counting 
one. The conditions within the schoolroom and the 
time practice were kept as nearly uniform as possible 
from day to day. 
Dr. Kirby’s results show that the 732 fourth-grade 
children, who received practice in addition, had a median 
ability at the end of the first fifteen minutes of practice 
of 23.3 columns added correctly and a median accuracy 
of 79 percent. In other words fifty per cent of the pupils 
added 23.3 per cent or more of the columns while fifty 
per cent added 23.3 per cent or less of them correctly. 
A median of 79 per cent of accuracy shows that there 
were as many children who added correctly four fifths or 
more of their problems as there were who added cor- 
rectly four fifths or less. It will be observed that we 
have referred only to the problems worked correctly ; 
the median number of problems actually worked was 
29.5, the difference between the two medians being 6.2. 
In the final fifteen minutes of practice in addition the
-P-A-G-E-197
TESTS AND RESULTS 189 : 
group added correctly a median of 10.7 more columns . 
than in the initial fifteen minutes period. This meant : 
a median percentile gain of 48 per cent for the practice. 
That speed and accuracy are not directly related is 
shown by the fact that this gain of 10.7 problems added 
correctly was accompanied by a median loss in accuracy 
of .4 per cent. This negative relation is more apparent 
than real, for the pupils actually tried more problems 
and solved more correctly during the last fifteen minutes 
of practice. They gained in speed, but while they were 
doing so their accuracy remained almost ata standstill. 
The 606 children who took. the practice in division 
showed an initial median ability of 34.5 combinations 
with a median per cent of accuracy of 93 per cent, and 
the final practice showed a median ability of 62 com- 
binations with a median percentile gain in accuracy of 
2.6 per cent.   We cannot be certain that Dr. Kirby’s figures rep- 
resent norms that may be applied to all third and fourth 
grade children, but they should be accepted until further 
experimentation refines them. 
A fact of very great interest to every supervisor is 
the relative value of drill periods of different lengths. 
This was the particular problem with which Dr. Kirby 
was concerned. It will be remembered that he gave the 
practice in addition to four groups. His results in 
addition are summarized in the following tables:

In the above tables the individual in the group was 
considered as the unit; 7.e., these averages or medians 
represent central tendencies secured by tabulating the 
scores of all the pupils, irrespective of the classes in 
which they were registered. The table shows that the 
greatest gain in speed was made by the two-minute 
drill group, while the only group that made any gain 
in accuracy was the 223-minute drill group. 
The central tendency for each class was also computed 
and the average of these central tendencies was found. 
These averages corroborate the evidence presented in 
the preceding table.

  Considering the facts for both addition and division, it ap- 
pears that, subject to discounts for the inequalities of the groups 
in initial ability, there is considerable advantage in the short  
-P-A-G-E-201
  
TESTS AND RESULTS 193 
period lengths, when the length is two minutes. The advantage 
there is noteworthy, since in addition the gain is greater than 
in the longer-period groups, even when their ability was greater 
in the longer period (Group II); and since in division the gain 
is so very much greater than in the 20 or 10-minute group. 
The facts can be freed from the influence of inequalities in 
ability at the beginning of practice by comparing only those of 
equal initial ability. For example, we find in the case of division 
that those of initial ability 15 averaged in gain 18.0, 26.3, and 23 
according as they had practiced in 20-, 10-, or 2-minute periods. 
Making such calculations for those of each initial ability 
in division from 5 to 64 and allowing equal weight to each suc- 
cessive set of five successive groups, it appears that on the aver- 
age the 20-minute, ro-minute and 2-minute period varieties of 
practice brought to those of equal initial ability gains in the 
relation of 100, 1103, and 177. 
In the case of addition the same procedure, carried out with 
those on initial abilities 5, 6, 7, and so on up through 49, gives 
the following results: according as the practice was in 223, 15, 
6, or 2 minute divisions, it brought to those of equal initial ability 
gains in the relation of 100, 121, ro1, and 1463. 
It appears, then, that the superiority of the shortest practice 
period length.remains when inequalities of initial ability are 
eliminated. It appears further that the periods of intermediate 
length have really a greater superiority over the longest period 
than the results irrespective of difference in initial ability showed. 
There is a positive relation between initial ability and gross gain. 
Consequently Group III in addition and Group II in division, 
which happened to be groups of low initial ability, suffered in the 
comparison. 
Dr. Kirby cautions the reader against the conclusion 
that the short practice periods are wholly responsible 
for the difference in gain. He points out that those 
° 
   
-P-A-G-E-202
  
194 THE SUPERVISION OF ARITHMETIC 
having the shortest practice periods had: more days in 
which to profit from the practice and in which to profit 
from the regular school work, that they had a better 
opportunity of catching the spirit of the experiment, and 
that consequently they had a more powerful incentive 
to practice outside. Regardless of the causes, his 
material shows indisputably that the short periods pay 
the best dividends. We are therefore unable to sub- 
scribe to Dr. Kirby’s conclusion that perhaps for ad- 
ministrative reasons it would be better to use the long 
periods in school. We see no especial administrative 
difficulties, certainly none that are insuperable, — in 
having daily drills of two minutes. This is a case, so 
it seems to us, where an administrative adjustment 
should be subordinated to a teaching adjustment. 
Tests given by Dr. Kirby several months after the 
final test of the experiment was given, showed a rela- 
tively high degree of permanence of the practice effect.

HOW THE INVESTIGATION WAS CONDUCTED 
Tests were given in the sixth grades of three different 
public school systems and in the sixth grade of a large 
' private school. The total number of cases recorded in

to Teach Arithmetic, Ross Peterson & Co.
-P-A-G-E-203
  TESTS AND RESULTS 195 
this study was 222; of these, 110 were boys and 112 
were girls. 
The three public schools examined are in the Central 
West. City C has a population of seven thousand; 
City M, of twelve thousand; and City D, of thirty 
thousand. ‘The private school is in New York City. 
The effects of the drill in fundamentals were shown by 
a comparison of sections subjected to the drill with 
sections of equal size and approximately equal ability 
not subjected to the drill but otherwise undergoing 
the same arithmetical instruction. The object was to 
determine the improvement made by the drill class 
upon its previous record and the improvement made by 
the non-drill class upon its previous record. 
' Ina given class the tests were conducted at the same 
hour of the school day, in order to eliminate the time 
factor as far as possible. 
Immediately after the first test was given in each 
school, half of the classes examined in each city were 
given five minutes’ drill each day upon the fundamental 
operations in arithmetic,— addition, subtraction, multipli- 
cation, and division. The first five minutes of the recita- 
tion period in arithmetic were devoted to the drill work. 
The drill was partly oral and partly written, and the time 
was about evenly distributed among the four operations. 
No special instructions were given to the teachers in 
charge of the drill sections, except that they were to em-
-P-A-G-E-204
    196 THE SUPERVISION OF ARITHMETIC 
phasize both speed and accuracy in the four operations, 
and were to cover the same daily assignments in the text- 
books as the class that had no drill. The teachers of 
the non-drill classes were asked to give no formal drill 
upon any of the four fundamental operations during the 
time that this investigation was in progress. These 
instructions were carefully observed by the teachers. 
The drill classes in each city were able to cover the 
same subject-matter of the text as the non-drill classes 
of that city. No special tests were given to determine 
the comparative excellence of the textbook work, but in 
every case the teacher in charge of a drill class reported 
that five minutes devoted to drill at the beginning of 
each recitation seemed to act as a mental tonic. It 
seemed to energize the pupils and to make them keen for 
the textbook work that was to follow. All teachers of 
drill classes reported an improvement in textbook work. 
Formal drill work on the four fundamental operations 
had not been given prior to this investigation in any of 
the sixth grades examined. Whatever marked changes 
occurred in all of the drill sections that did not occur in 
the non-drill sections may reasonably be attributed to 
the results of the special drill. 
RESULTS OF THE DRILL 
If the number of problems worked in each test may be 
taken as a measure of the speed of the pupils, the drill
-P-A-G-E-205
TESTS AND RESULTS 107 
class increased its speed by 16.9 per cent and the non- 
drill class by 6.4 per cent. 
Since practically all of the pupils finished at least the 
first six problems in each test, a comparison of the rec- 
ords made on these six problems will give a basis for 
determining the relative accuracy. Measured by this 
standard, the drill class made a gain of 11.7 per cent in 
accuracy, whereas the non-drill class actually lost in 
accuracy ( —1.8 per cent). 
The largest gain made by the drill class was in 
division, 34.2 per cent, which was more than twice 
the gain made in division by the non-drill class, 15.4 
per cent. 
If we compare the gain made by the drill class upon its 
own record with the gain made by the non-drill class 
upon its own record, we find that the following results 
were attained: 
Drill class gained 2.64 times as much as non-drill class on 
problems worked. 
Drill class gained 2.72 times as much as non-drill class in addi- 
tion. 
Drill class gained 2.68 times as much as non-drill class in sub- 
traction. 
Drill class gained 2.21 times as much as non-drill class in 
multiplication. 
Drill class gained 3.13 times as much as non-drill class in 
division. 
Drill class gained 2.57 times as much as non-drill class in total 
number of points.

  198 THE SUPERVISION OF ARITHMETIC 
The drill classes made from two and one fifth to 
three and one tenth times as much improvement as the 
non-drill classes. It is worthy of note that the average 
age in the drill classes was exactly the same as the 
average age in the non-drill classes, being twelve and 
two tenths years in each case. 
In the following table the first test was given before the 
drill was begun, the second test was given immediately after 
the thirty days’ drill, and the third test was given on the 
first day of the fall term, after a vacation of twelve weeks :

I did 36.7 per cent better than on first test and 7.3 per cent 
better than on second test in division. 
II did 11.1 per cent better than on first test and 2.8 per cent 
poorer than on second test in division. 
I did 31.7 per cent better than on first test and o.2 per cent 
poorer than on second test in total points. 
II did 12.16 per cent better than on first test and 2.29 per cent 
poorer than on second test in total points. 
I did 5.2 per cent better than on first test and 0.6 per cent poorer 
than on second test in first six problems. 
II did 3.7 per cent poorer than on first test and 1.3 per cent poorer 
than on second test in first six problems. 
The results of the third test indicated that the supe- 
riority of the drill class was maintained over the vacation 
period. The “‘period of hibernation” served to increase 
the speed, while those who had not had the advantage of 
the drill worked no faster than on the second test. The 
non-drill section either made no improvement or did worse 
than on the second test in everything except subtraction. 
No investigation has yet been made to determine the 
relative efficiency of drill periods from one to ten or 
fifteen minutes, or whether the same length of period 
is best for each of the fundamental operations. 
Tue ABILITY OF CHILDREN TO Express MATHE- 
MATICAL JUDGMENTS 
Dr. Frederick G. Bonser! of the Teachers College 
of Columbia University made an investigation of the

reasoning abilities of children. He tested 757 children 
in the fourth, fifth, and sixth grades in Passaic, New 
Jersey. 
He tested the mathematical judgment by giving the 
children twenty questions in arithmetic involving three 
steps: “First, the analysis of the situation by which 
the essential features of the problems are conceived and 
abstracted; second, the recall of an appropriate prin- 
ciple to be applied to the abstracted problem, a search 
among various principles which may suggest themselves 
for the right one; and third, involving the second, 
the inference, the recognition of identity between the 
known principle and the new situation. Clearly these 
are examples of deductive reasoning of the usual scien- 
tific, involving data, principles, and inferences.” The 
tests are as follows:

TESTS AND RESULTS 203 
The meaning of the foregoing table becomes clear 
when read thus: In grade 4a, one boy had ability 2, one 
boy had ability 3, four boys had ability 4, and so on 
down to the case of one boy with ability 32. 
In order to see more clearly the differences in results 
attained by boys and girls in the different grades, the 
following summary has been made:

ORR ee Hranitecess 28.00 25.92 3:96 5-95 
  
The table above should be read thus: The median 
ability of 4a boys was 14.50, 4a girls 11.36. The ability 
of half of the boys was within 5.39 of the median for the 
boys. The ability of half of the girls was within 4.21 of 
the median for the girls. Q is used here as a measure of 
variability. “It is gotten by counting in from the low 
end of the distribution until 25 per cent of the cases are 
covered ; and likewise from the high end of the distribu- 
tion until the point marking 75 per cent of the cases is 
reached. These two values give the limit within which 
exactly 50 per cent of the cases lie. Subtracting the
-P-A-G-E-212
  204 THE SUPERVISION OF ARITHMETIC 
lower value from the higher and dividing the result by 2 
gives the variability in steps of the unit of measure used.” 
It should be noted that the median performance of 
boys and girls in response to this test of mathematical 
judgment steadily increases from the fourth grade to 
the sixth grade. The supervisor here has evidence 
sufficient to justify a clear differentiation in regard to 
the standard of mathematical judgment which should 
be set up for the fourth grade, the fifth grade, or the 
sixth grade. 
The difference in ability of boys and girls in each 
grade is also worthy of note. While it is commonly 
stated that boys exceed girls in the ability to express a 
mathematical judgment, there is little scientific evidence 
to support this contention. 
The following summary by Dr. Bonser states the 
case very clearly: 
Other than the evident differences in the foregoing, the simplest 
summary of sex differences is in a statement of the per cents of 
the boys who reach or exceed the ability reached by 50 per cent of 
the girls as given below:

  206 THE SUPERVISION OF ARITHMETIC 
After calculating the median and the ages for each 
sex, Mr. Bonser combined them into the following table:

  In conclusion Dr. Bonser says: 
“A study of the median abilities of the respective grades shows 
progress through these from grade to grade for both boys and 
girls... . The greatest gain in per cent from one grade to the 
next for both is from 4A to 5B. The smallest gain is, for boys, 
from grade 5B to 5A; for girls, from 6B to 6A... . In these 
tests, variability diminishes from grade 4A upward.” 
In view of the experiments which other investigators 
have made, it is likely that the reason that variability 
diminishes throughout the upper grades is that the 
children in the upper grades are more highly selected. 
The upper-grade students are the students who have 
survived the rigors of the elementary school curriculum. 
The upper-grade work is also probably more nearly 
standardized. 
Concerning age differences, Dr. Bonser says: 
“From the array of median abilities of half years, the regularity 
of progression found on the basis of school grades is not at all in 
evidence.
-P-A-G-E-215
  TESTS AND RESULTS 207 
“A rhythm in ability is fairly apparent for the boys with its 
first crest at about 9 years 6 months, the second at about 12 
years, and the third at about 14 years 6 months, each crest a 
little higher than the preceding. . . . Retardation seems evident 
in the pupils of each respective grade who are from two to four 
years older than the median age for that grade. There also 
seems evident another type of retardation in these special abilities, 
perhaps quite as important, in those pupils who are from two to 
three years younger than the median age for their respective 
grades... . In tests in which progress from grade to grade 
and year to year is so very evident, in large groups as here shown, 
these wide divergencies in ability of lowest and highest quarters 
of these respective groups indicate that native ability is measured 
by the tests quite as much as school training.” 
In regard to sex differences, Dr. Bonser says: 
“The one marked sex difference is that of the superiority of the 
boys in these tests. By every distribution, in every one of its 
respective divisions, the boys are shown to be more able than 
the girls excepting in two cases of selected groups, one from grade 
4A, and the other from grade 6A. In the youngest 25 per cent 
of the former grade, the girls just equal the boys in median ability, 
while for the corresponding group for the latter grade the girls 
slightly excel... . The sex difference diminishes as we proceed up 
the grades from 4 to 6. Should we proceed far enough (test chil- 
dren in higher grades), we might reach the condition found by Fox 
and Thorndike in a study of 28 boys and 49 girls of high school age 
where ‘ girls do about 5 per cent better on the whole than boys.’ ” 
The percentage of all of the boys reaching or exceed- 
ing the ability reached by 50 per cent of all of the boys 
taken together is 71.43. The median ability of all of the 
boys taken together is 22.60 with a coefficient of varia- 
bility of .26; of the girls, is 17.75 with a coefficient of .39.

  208 THE SUPERVISION OF ARITHMETIC 
AN INVESTIGATION IN REGARD TO THE DEVELOPMENT 
OF STANDARD TESTS 
Following the report of Dr. Stone, Mr. S. A. Courtis, 
now Director of Research in the Detroit public school, 
became interested in the development of a series of 
standard tests for the different grades and different 
abilities in arithmetic. As a result of his activities, the 
same arithmetic tests have now been given under as 
nearly uniform conditions as possible to thousands and 
thousands of children distributed throughout the United 
States. 5000 children were tested in Detroit; 33,000 
in New York; 20,000 in Boston. The tests have 
been given quite generally throughout smaller cities 
of the United States, as Mr. Courtis has succeeded in 
securing the codperation of a large number of school 
supervisors throughout the country. By this means 
he was enabled to arrive at certain tentative standards 
of excellence to be attained by children in the different 
4 grades in certain abilities in arithmetic. For example, 
despite the variability in performance of children in 
the fifth grade in addition, fifth-grade children tended 
to attain a certain standard of excellence, which was 
somewhat less than the standard of excellence attained 
in the same test by children in the sixth grade; which 
was, in a similar way, somewhat lower than that at- 
tained in the same test by children in the seventh grade, 
and so on. Thus Mr. Courtis has attempted to deter- 
 
-P-A-G-E-217
  
TESTS AND RESULTS 209 
mine the standards of attainment which we have a 
right to expect from normal children in the different 
grades in addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, 
copying figures, one-step problems in reasoning, ab- 
stract examples in the four fundamentals, and two-step 
problems in reasoning. 
For those who believe in the teaching of the formal 
side of arithmetic, these tests give a view of the com- 
pleteness and balance of training afforded by any 
particular school as compared with the average achieve- 
ments of schools in other places, and they furnish the 
teacher with accurate measures of the peculiarities and 
weaknesses of individuals which enable him to adjust his 
work accordingly. Three editions of this series, equal in 
value but differing in every figure, have been published, 
so that repeated tests may be made either during one 
year or in successive years. When this is done, the re- 
sults obtained in one grade may be passed along with 
the child for the guidance of teachers in the higher 
grades, the curves for different years being drawn upon 
‘ the same graph sheet. 
It should be said that results secured by tests given 
under conditions unlike those described by Mr. Courtis ? 
1 The series is known as series A. A later series of Courtis tests is 
known as series B. 
2 These tests have been prepared upon regular form sheets and can 
be secured together with the instructions for giving them from Mr. S. A. 
Courtis, 82 Eliot Street, Detroit, Michigan.

or using the combinations in a different order cannot 
be compared with those obtained by Mr. Courtis. The 
conditions must be duplicated in every respect if the 
results are to be compared. 
These (series A) tests have been given by Mr. Courtis 
himself, or by teachers under his immediate supervision, 
to more than 60,000 children in grades ranging from the 
third to the eighth. As a result of this, standard 
scores have been computed for each of the grades above 
the second. The following table presents these scores :

This table should be interpreted as follows : 
The average third-grade child should do 26 additions 
in one minute; 19 subtractions; 16 multiplications; 
16 divisions ; should copy 63 figures; should attempt 2.5 
of the speed reasoning problems and get 1.5 right, etc. 
The attainment of each grade is also indicated by the 
table. For example: An average fourth-grade child
-P-A-G-E-219
  
TESTS AND RESULTS 211 
should do 8 more additions than an average third-grade 
child. A fifth-grade child should do 8 more than a fourth- 
grade child. Similar standards are shown for each of the 
grades. By the use of such standard scores as these, 
teachers can determine whether each pupil has attained 
the standard degree of ability for his grade and he can 
also determine what pupils may be excused from taking 
work in those phases of the subject in which they have al- 
ready advanced beyond the standard set for their grade. 
Mr. Courtis has prepared a graph sheet by means of 
which one may graphically represent his attainment in 
each of these abilities or by which the attainment of 
any given class or room or school may be represented. 
Later Mr. Courtis, feeling the need of a simpler series 
of tests which would be less expensive in time and money, 
proposed his series B. In announcing this series Mr. 
Courtis says, ‘‘The experimental work of the past few 
years proves that if school work is to be made more 
efficient, there must be: 
“t. Definition of Aim. 
Illustration : Eighth-grade teachers should practice their children 
in addition until they can add correctly in eight minutes, twelve 
examples, each example three columns wide, each column nine 
figures long. 
“2, Limitation of Training. 
Illustration: As soon as an eighth-grade child’s scores reach 
the standard, he should be excused from further work in addition, 
whether he makes a year’s gain in one month or ten. 
   
-P-A-G-E-220
    212 THE SUPERVISION OF ARITHMETIC 
“3. Specialization of Training. 
Illustration: The child that is up to standard in addition, but 
below in subtraction, should be given increased drill in subtrac- 
tion, the extra time coming from the limitation of training in 
addition. 
“4, Diagnosis and Remed ’ of Individual Defects. 
Illustration: If a child’s scores do not rise with class practice, 
he should be studied individually, his symptoms observed, his 
difficulties discovered, and the proper adjustment of his work 
made.” 
The following median scores for series B are submitted. 
It should be noted that these are tentative only, and 
subject to such modifications as may be suggested by 
additional data:

LATER STANDARDS { 
After giving almost half a million series B tests to 
children in forty-two different states, Mr. Courtis found 
the following to be the approximate median score for 
June. These standards, or medians, are for speed only, 
as he did not include problems inaccurately solved.

“Translated into words the table means that in June 
the graduate of a grammar school should be able to work 
correctly in eight minutes twelve examples like that 
under Test I; in four minutes twelve examples like that 
under Test 2, etc.” 
Mr. Courtis says: ‘The scores given in Table I 
represent approximately the median speed of work for 
the different grades and are based upon returns that are 
nearly nation-wide in scope. The range of variation in
-P-A-G-E-223
TESTS AND RESULTS 215 
schools in different cities and states is approximately 
four examples above and below the median; i.e., in 
some schools the median eighth-grade scores will rise as 
high as 16 examples in addition and others go as low 
as 8 examples. Not more than five eighth-grade classes 
per hundred will exceed these limits, except as very 
peculiar and special conditions prevail. On the other 
hand, the range of speed of work in individuals varies 
from a score of but two or three examples to scores of 
twenty-four examples, the limit of the test.” 
SUPERVISION IMPORTANT 
The experimentation of Rice, Stone, and Courtis all 
suggest the fact that the most important single factor 
in effective’ arithmetical instruction is that of close 
supervision. Mr. Rice was convinced that the most 
important single factor was that of tests being given 
by the supervisor. The preliminary investigation of Mr. 
Stone and the extended investigation of Mr. Courtis 
are such as to enable a supervisor at the present time 
to coéperate with other supervisors in the matter: of 
arriving at standards of excellence which we have a 
right to expect of children in addition, subtraction, etc., 
in the different grades. No supervisor at the present 
time can afford to neglect the opportunity of securing 
the codperation of others in regard to this important 
phase of work.
-P-A-G-E-224
  216 THE SUPERVISION OF ARITHMETIC 
The investigations which have been made in the past 
confirm the thesis that the supervisor who knows the 
results to be expected from grade to grade in arithmetic, 
and who definitely tests the progress of the teachers in 
attaining these results, will be able to arrive at a satis- 
factory standard of efficiency in the teaching of arith- 
metic under supervision. 
Mr. Courtis’s tests are effective agencies in deter- 
mining the station of an individual student, a class, or 
a school. By means of them any student can discover 
his relative strengths and weaknesses in the abilities 
tested, and any teacher or supervisor can determine 
those particular phases of arithmetic that the children 
should receive additional instruction in as well as those 
that may for the time being be neglected or dropped 
altogether. Certainly there can be no justification for 
continuing practice upon those things that the pupils 
have already acquired greater skill in than the world 
needs. 
A superintendent can also use such standards as these 
for estimating the efficiency of his teachers. The appli- 
cation of the standards will not reveal to him the causes 
of weakness in his teachers, but will reveal the points 
at which weakness occurs. The superintendent and 
teacher are then free to try new devices at these points 
for the purpose of securing greater efficiency. 
Unlike some of our present-day reformers who are
-P-A-G-E-225
TESTS AND RESULTS 217 
wedded to the doctrine of individual indifferences and 
who advocate a course of study for each child, Mr. 
Courtis contends that there are certain habits, skills, 
and knowledges which should be acquired by all the 
children. Put in his epigrammatic way, he says that 
instead of giving uniform material in a uniform way 
and getting varying results (as we have in the past) 
we should give varying material to varying children to 
get uniform results. This, we believe, to be an end 
devoutly to be desired. It calls for a study of the in- 
dividual capacities and abilities ‘of the pupils and for 
an intelligent application of materials to suit their 
needs so that they all attain that uniform standard, — 
a standard determined by the social serviceableness of 
the material in the ordinary walks of life.
